[[Cross-cultural psychology]]

CATEGORIES: Cross-cultural psychology, Social psychology

[tpl]Psychology sidebar[/tpl]Cross-cultural psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes, including both their variability and invariance, under diverse cultural conditions.Ho, D. Y. F., & Wu, M. (2001). Introduction to cross-cultural psychology. In L. L. Adler & U. P. Gielen (Eds.), Cross-cultural topics in psychology (pp. 3–13). Westport, CT: Praeger. Through expanding research methodologies to recognize cultural variance in behavior, language, and meaning it seeks to extend and develop psychology.Gielen, U. P., & Roopnarine, J. L. (Eds.).(2004). Childhood and adolescence: Cross-cultural perspectives and applications. Westport: CT: Praeger. Since psychology as an academic discipline was developed largely in North America, some psychologists became concerned that constructs accepted as universal were not as invariant as previously assumed, especially since many attempts to replicate notable experiments in other cultures had varying success.Smith, Peter B., Michael Harris Bond, and Cigdem Kagitcibasi. Understanding Social Psychology Across Cultures. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage, 2006Smith, Peter B., and Michael Harris Bond. Social Psychology Across Cultures. 2nd ed. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 1999 Since there are questions as to whether theories dealing with central themes, such as affect, cognition, conceptions of the self, and issues such as psychopathology, anxiety, and depression, may lack external validity when "exported" to other cultural contexts, cross-cultural psychology re-examines them using methodologies designed to factor in cultural differences so as to account for cultural variance.Vijver, Fons van de, and Kwok Leung. Methods and Data Analysis for Cross-Cultural Research. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1997 Although some critics have pointed to methodological flaws in cross-cultural psychological research and claim that serious shortcomings in the theoretical and methodological bases used impede rather than help the scientific search for universal principles in psychology, cross-cultural psychologists are turning more to the study of how differences (variance) occur, rather than searching for universals in the style of physics or chemistry.
In 1972 the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP) was established.[tpl]cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=What is Cross Cultural Psychology|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/branchesofpsycholog1/f/cross-cultural.htm|accessdate=19 November 2012[/tpl] This branch of psychology has continued to expand as there has been an increasing popularity of incorporating culture and diversity into studies.
Cross-cultural psychology is differentiated from cultural psychology, which refers to the branch of psychology that holds that human behavior is significantly influenced by cultural differences, meaning that psychological phenomena can only be compared with each other across cultures to a very limited extent. In contrast, cross-cultural psychology includes a search for possible universals in behavior and mental processes. Cross-cultural psychology "can be thought of as a type research methodology, rather than an entirely separate field within psychology".[tpl]cite journal|last=Lonner|first=W.

[[Midsourcing]]
CATEGORIES: Business terms

Midsourcing refers to the practice of hiring a local contract engineering service firm to provide management of outsourced/offshored labor for software, hardware, and IT engineering.  Midsourcing is a recent modification to the outsourcing model which aims to minimize possible quality problems by providing management liaison services between the customer and the offshore firm.  
The midsourcing company offers quality control management and language/communication translation services to the local company, thereby avoiding the most common criticism of outsourcing. Midsourcing is a middle ground between outsourcing and insourcing for high tech companies.  It aims to make the cost benefits of outsourced/offshored labor available to smaller, more technically advanced companies and projects.
The purpose of midsourcing is to provide high quality software and hardware engineering to companies at prices that are comparable to the cost of outsourcing/offshoring, while eliminating the problems most commonly associated with outsourcing.  Midsourcing is a modification to the trend in high technology of outsourcing jobs directly to lower cost labor markets in places like the Indian subcontinent, China, and Eastern Europe. By acting as a middle layer between the customer (usually in the U.S.) and the offshore firm, the midsourcing company offers quality control and management oversight of the offshored project, and closes gaps in translation and communication.  As a liaison between the original development team and the offshore labor, the midsourcing firm reduces the challenges and risks that have arisen with outsourcing. Whether for reasons of language and communication problems or poor management and oversight, not being able to meet the high engineering standards of customers has threatened the viability of outsourcing/offshoring as a cost-savng measure for many high tech firms.  
As the practice of outsourcing and offshoring developed and matured during the late 90's and early 2000s, several problems with the model became clear.  Most significantly, compromises in engineering quality became real stumbling blocks for companies looking to outsourcing for complex design and development work.  The time and labor cost that is required for U.S. firms to manage outsourced projects has also often been overlooked or underestimated.  Local management and technical development resources must be dedicated to an outsourced project in order to define requirements, manage changes, provide translation services, and oversee testing and quality control.  Since in many cases the customer cannot afford the time or cost of dedicating its own management and development resources to effectively manage the outsourced team, the midsourcing firm takes on those tasks, shepherding the project from the planning stages through development to testing and deployment.

Novarese, locally pronounced Nuares, is a dialect of the Western Lombard language spoken in the province of Novara (Piedmont).
The dialect is rarely used in the city, where the use of Italian language is preferred, largely because of high immigration from Mezzogiorno; Novarese is more often used in the surrounding rural areas. There are some elements of transition with the Piedmontese language, particularly on the eastern coasts of the Sesia river, creating several transition dialects.

The Buddhist crisis was a period of political and religious tension in South Vietnam between May and November 1963, characterized by a series of repressive acts by the South Vietnamese government and a campaign of civil resistance, led mainly by Buddhist monks.Adam Roberts, ‘Buddhism and Politics in South Vietnam’, The World Today, Royal Institute of International Affairs, London, vol. 21, no. 6, June 1965, pp. 240–50 analyses the causes of the Buddhist crisis and its significance as a case of non-violent struggle. 
The crisis was precipitated by the shootings of nine unarmed civilians on May 8 in the central city of Huế who were protesting a ban of the Buddhist flag. The crisis ended with a coup in November 1963 by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, and the arrest and assassination of President Ngô Đình Diệm on November 2, 1963.

Earl Franklin Leggett (born March 5, 1933 in Palatka, Florida - died May 15, 2008 in Raymond, Mississippi) was an American football defensive lineman in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, Los Angeles Rams, and the New Orleans Saints. He played college football at Louisiana State University. He was also an assistant coach for various teams.
Leggett's career as a professional football athlete began as a first-round draft pick of the Chicago Bears in 1957 and spanned 11 years (1957–1968).  He is recorded as having played in 132 professional football games. 
His career with the Chicago Bears lasted from 1957 to 1965 where he played at both Defensive Tackle and Defensive End positions. He was part of the famed "Monsters of the Midway" defense that led the Bears to the 1963 NFL championship. He was traded to The Los Angeles Rams in 1966 where he played in 10 regular season games with the Los Angeles Rams' "Fearsome Foursome" defense. 
Toward the end of his career, journeyman Leggett played 20 games in 1967 & 1968 for the expansion New Orleans Saints franchise. While statistics on sacks were not recorded back then, www.pro-football-reference.com credits Leggett with 16 fumble recoveries, 1 safety and 1 interception.
Leggett was a good friend to many and did outstanding community service in the Mississippi area and Gulf Coast region.  He first played college football at Hinds Jr. College (today known as Hinds Community College) which was the only school that would give him a chance due to academic cirumstances. He started playing for them at 16 (which was then legal) and was able to raise his academic standing to get into Louisiana State University. Leggett became an All-Southeastern Conference player at LSU.

Paul Henkel (December 15, 1754 – November 27, 1825) was a native of North Carolina who became an itinerant evangelist for the Lutheran church in the eastern United States.
He was born in Rowan County, North Carolina, in 1754. His family moved to what is now West Virginiahttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~janelle/lutherans.htm while he was still young. In that environment, he developed a solid acquaintance with orthodox Lutheran works. He grew to become a cooper by trade, and was obliged to provide enough for his substantial family. Despite these demands on his time, he always gave his highest priority to conducting religious services. He took advantage of the numerous prayer meetings and Bible classes in his area to help him focus on spiritual values.
By 1781, he preached his first sermon, first in German, then in English. This began a period of missionary work which would continue for the next forty years. He was licensed as a preacher by the Ministerium of Pennsylvania in 1783 to begin  his work, being ordained by the same body in 1792.  He worked in the area of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. Although he did receive some financial assistance for his missionary work, the majority of the expenses were paid for out of his own pocket. His work included preaching, baptizing, and creating new congregations in the communities he visited. He also worked to organize clergy for the organization and administrative purposes. He helped to found the North Carolina Synod in 1803. This group helped provide discipline and moral support for the people of the area, and also helped its members withstand the great degree of emotionalism which was a regular feature of several revival movements of the time.
He returned to Virginia in 1806. There, he began distributing books through his sons' printing house, the Henkel Press, which thus became the only Lutheran publishing house in the country for many years.  He also continued his missionary travels, and helped form the Joint Synod of Ohio in 1818 and the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod in 1820. He used his prominence to help argue against the ideas of Samuel Simon Schmucker, which he considered far too liberal. Henkel actively resisted cooperating with Schmucker in his hope of uniting all the evangelical churches, as he was staunchly opposed to the appearance of ideological compromise which he thought would be given by such an alliance.  His strict adherence to the traditional doctrine, including the Augsburg Confession, served as one of the basis for the strong confessional movement which would later flourish in many parts of the North American Lutheran community.
A paralytic stroke Henkel suffered in 1823 substantially limited his activities. He did however remain an active preacher and writer until just six weeks before his death in 1825.

[[Uranium mining in the United States]]
CATEGORIES: Uranium mining in the United States

Uranium mining in the United States produced 4.8 million pounds of uranium concentrate in 2013, the largest amount since 1997. Production came one conventional uranium mill in Utah, and six in-situ leach operations: three in Wyoming, two in Texas, and one in Nebraska. The plants in Wyoming provided 81% of the nation’s uranium production.US Energy Information Administration, Domestic Uranium Production Report – Quarterly, - 4th Quarter 2013, 31 Jan 2014.
While uranium is used primarily for nuclear power, uranium mining had its roots in the production of uranium-bearing ore in 1898 with the mining of carnotite-bearing sandstones of the Colorado Plateau in Colorado and Utah, for their vanadium content. The late 1940s and early 1950s saw a boom in uranium mining in the western U.S., spurred by the fortunes made by prospectors such as Charlie Steen.  The United States was the world's leading producer of uranium from 1953 until 1980, when annual U.S. production peaked at 16,810 metric tons U3O8.Uranium 2003: Resources, Production and Demand, Paris: OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, 2004, p.238  Until the early 1980s, there were active uranium mines in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.Warren I. Finch and others (1973) Nuclear fuels, in United States Mineral Resources, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 820, p.458.
Price declines in the late 1970s and early 1980s forced the closure of numerous mines.  Most uranium ore in the United States comes from deposits in sandstone, which tend to be of lower grade than those of Australia and Canada.  Because of the lower grade, many uranium deposits in the United States became uneconomic when the price of uranium declined sharply in the late 1970s.  By 2001, there were only three operating uranium mines (all in-situ leaching operations) in the United States.  Annual production reached a low of 779 metric tons of uranium oxide in 2003, but then more than doubled in three years to 1672 metric tons in 2006, from 10 mines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html |title=World Uranium Mining 2011 |publisher=World-nuclear.org |accessdate=2012-10-16[/tpl] The U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration reported that 90% of U.S. uranium production in 2006 came from in-situ leaching.U.S. Energy Information Administration: U.S. uranium mine production and number of mines and sources, accessed 6 March 2009.
The average spot price of uranium oxide (U3O8) increased from $7.92 per pound in 2001 to $39.48 per pound ($[tpl]convert|39.48|kg|lb|2|disp=output number only[/tpl]/kg) in 2006.Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration data, official energy statistics from the U.S. Government In 2011 the United States mined 9% of the uranium consumed by its nuclear power plants.US Energy Information Administration, Where our uranium comes from, 2 July 2012.  The remainder was imported, principally from Russia (50%), Canada, and Australia.Warren I Finch (2003) Uranium-fuel for nuclear energy 2002, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 2179-A.[ref]See S&TR: September 2005, How One Equation Changed the World, which discusses the progress of the HEU Purchase Agreement made between the Russian Federation and the United States in 1993.
"Currently, Russian plants are processing about 30 metric tons of HEU per year into about 875 metric tons of LEU. This amount meets half the annual fuel requirement for U.S. nuclear power plants and provides the fuel to generate 10 percent of the electricity used in the U.S."[/ref] Although uranium production has declined to low levels, the United States has the fourth-largest uranium resource in the world, behind Australia, Canada, and Kazakhstan.  United States uranium reserves are strongly dependent on price.  At $50 per pound U3O8, reserves are estimated to be 539 million pounds; however, at a price of $100 per pound, reserves are an estimated 1227 million pounds.US Energy Information Administration, U.S. uranium reserves estimates, July 2010.  Rising uranium prices since 2001 have increased interest in uranium mining in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Utah.WISE Uranium Project: New uranium mining projects - USA, accessed 25 March 2009.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/business/28uranium.html?ex=1332734400&en=2ee40a7e7c5a9144&ei=5088& | work=The New York Times | first1=Susan | last1=Moran | first2=Anne | last2=Raup | title=Uranium Ignites ‘Gold Rush' in the West | date=28 March 2007[/tpl] The states with the largest known uranium ore reserves (not counting byproduct uranium from phosphate) are (in order) Wyoming, New Mexico, and Colorado.J. Keller and others, Colorado, Mining Engineering, May 2006, p.76.
The radiation hazards of uranium mining and milling were not appreciated in the early years, resulting in workers being exposed to high levels of radiation.  Inhalation of radon gas caused sharp increases in lung cancers among underground uranium miners employed in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1950, the US Public Health service began a comprehensive study of uranium miners, leading to the first publication of a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining, released in 1962.Dawson, Susan E, and Gary E Madsen.

The Navajo People and Uranium Mining. Albuquerque : University of New Mexico Press, 2006.
In 1990, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), granting reparations for those affected by mining.

Dorothy Lee (May 23, 1911 – June 24, 1999) was an American actress and comedian during the 1930s, usually appearing alongside the popular Wheeler & Woolsey comedy team.
Born Marjorie Elizabeth Millsap in Los Angeles, she started seeking film roles in 1929, after graduating from high school, but ended up in New York working on the stage. At 18, she signed with RKO Pictures and began working with Wheeler & Woolsey; she became so identified with the comedians that she seldom appeared apart from them.
She withdrew from the series after producer David O. Selznick tampered with her performance in Girl Crazy; she returned when Selznick's successor Mark Sandrich cast her in two well-received features in 1934. RKO replaced her with Mary Carlisle and then Betty Grable, but she returned in 1935 for two final appearances.
In the early 1940s, after Robert Woolsey had died, Bert Wheeler was struggling to re-establish himself as a solo performer, and asked Dorothy Lee to tour with him in vaudeville. She immediately interrupted her private life to help her old friend.
Lee was married six times, including briefly to Hollywood gossip columnist Jimmy Fidler. She had four children by her fifth husband, John Bersbach. She died in 1999, at the age of 88.

[[Ranchos of California]]

CATEGORIES: California ranchos, Baja California Ranchos, Cultural landscapes, History of California, Land law

The Spanish and, later, Mexican governments encouraged settlement of territory now known as California by the establishment of large land grants called ranchos, from which the English word ranch is derived. Land-grant titles (concessions) were government-issued, permanent, unencumbered property-ownership rights to land called ranchos. Devoted to raising cattle and sheep, the owners of the ranchos attempted to pattern themselves after the landed gentry of Spain. Their workers included Californian Native Americans who had learned to speak Spanish, many of them former Mission residents. Of the 800-plus grants, Spain made about 30 between 1784 and 1821. The remainder were granted by Mexico between 1833 and 1846. The ranchos established land-use patterns that are recognizable in the California of today. Rancho boundaries became the basis for California's land survey system, and can still be found on modern maps and land titles. Ranchos were partially based on geography, such as access to river water. Land development in the 20th and 21st century often follow the boundaries of the ranchos, and often retain the original name. For example, "Rancho San Diego," an unincorporated 'rural-burb' east of San Diego, or "Rancho Bernardo,", a masterplan suburb in the city of San Diego.

It is a systematic and adaptive process that strives to create new strategic and economic value through collaborative behaviors that leverage knowledge and experience, build upon ambition and curiosity and discover and apply new concepts while tolerating ambiguity and vulnerability.   There are four main steps in the entreship process:

Entreship reﬂects the efforts of both individuals and teams in developing new products, business models and services.  Quite often, the mechanics and inventive behaviors of entreship extend beyond the venture founder to external partners. These partners share ideas, risks, plans and action in the pathway to new venture planning and development.
There are two main areas of work in entreship. First, people combine ideas, resources and energy to develop platforms that have some commercial promise. Second, they connect capital to the development, launch and growth scheme of the venture.
Entreship is an important element in organic growth and business development, as set forth by Edward Hess.[ref]

The loi-cadre ( Reform Act) was a French legal reform passed by the French National Assembly on 23 June 1956. It marked a turning point in relations between France and its overseas empire. Under pressure from its colonized populations, the government transferred a number of powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in French African colonies and also removed remaining voting inequalities by implementing universal sufferage and abolishing the multiple electoral college system. It was the first step in the creation of the French Community, comparable to the British Commonwealth of Nations. Most French African colonies held elections under the new universal sufferage Loi Cadre system on 31 March 1957, the exceptions being Cameroon which held its election on 23 December 1956, and Togo which held its election on 17 April 1958. (Cameroon and Togo were United Nations mandated territories and so were on a different trajectory than the rest of French Africa).

The evolution of biological complexity is one important outcome of the process of evolution. Evolution has produced some remarkably complex organisms - although the actual level of complexity is very hard to define or measure accurately in biology, with properties such as gene content, the number of cell types or morphology all being used to assess an organism's complexity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Adami C |title=What is complexity? |journal=BioEssays |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1085–94 |year=2002 |pmid=12447974 |doi=10.1002/bies.10192[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Waldrop M. et al. |title=Language: Disputed definitions |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1023–1028 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/4551023a |pmid=18948925[/tpl] This observation that complex organisms can be produced from simpler ones has led to the common philosphical interpretation of evolution being progressive and having a direction that leads towards what are viewed as "higher organisms".[tpl]cite journal |author=McShea D |title=Complexity and evolution: What everybody knows |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=303–324 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00132234[/tpl]

Born Theresa McLaurin in Meridian, Mississippi, she married Robert Needham and moved to Chicago in the 1940s.  In December of 1949 she opened a basement club, Theresa's Lounge (sometimes also called T’s Basement), in an apartment building on South Indiana Avenue on the South Side of Chicago.  This attracted a predominantly black audience from the surrounding neighbourhood, but its appeal reached global proportions as a result of the calibre of music offered.  It featured live entertainment with Junior Wells and Buddy Guy in the house band, and attracted touring musicians such as Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Otis Spann, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Earl Hooker and Howlin' Wolf.  
The club relocated in 1983 when the landlord refused to renew the lease, and closed permanently in 1986.  Theresa Needham died in Chicago in 1992.

The T Tauri wind — so named because of the young star currently in this stage—is a phenomenon indicative of the phase of stellar development between the accretion of material from the slowing rotating material of a solar nebula and the ignition of the hydrogen that has agglomerated into the protostar.
The protostar, at first, only has about 1% of its final mass. But the envelope of the star continues to grow as infalling material is accreted. After 10,000–100,000 years,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit2/starform.html |title=Lecture 14: Star Formation |publisher=Astronomy.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16[/tpl] thermonuclear fusion begins in its core, then a strong stellar wind is produced which stops the infall of new mass. The protostar is now considered a young star since its mass is fixed, and its future evolution is now set.

"Father to a Sister of Thought" is a song written by Stephen Malkmus of Pavement that appears on the band's third album, Wowee Zowee (1995). On June 20, 1995, the song was released as the second single from the album in 7" vinyl and CD-single formats; the track list is the same for both versions. Both B-sides are included amongst the bonus tracks on 2006's deluxe Sordid Sentinels Edition reissue of Wowee Zowee.
"Father to a Sister of Thought" is unique in that it is about as close to alt-country or jangly-guitar rock that Pavement ever got, due to its use of pedal steel guitar and mixolydian mode. For most of the song, the harmony is limited to four chords, but it ends with an unexpected blues-style riff.  The music video for "Father to a Sister of Thought" features the band playing together in front of a western themed props painted by Steve Keene, which were also used by the band on tour during the period.

CATEGORIES: Device drivers

A mirror driver is a display driver for a virtual device that mirrors the drawing operations of one or more additional physical display devices.
When video mirroring is active, each time the system draws to the primary video device at a location inside the mirrored area, a copy of the draw operation is executed on the mirrored video device in real-time.[tpl]cite web | title = Windows Driver Kit: Glossary | publisher = Microsoft Developer Network | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms789543.aspx [/tpl]
Windows' mirror drivers were first introduced in 1998 with the Windows 2000 display driver model, which was renamed later to XPDM. In 2006, for Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Display Driver Model. The older drivers were still supported under Vista, but since the older model did not encompass support for features first introduced with Vista, those newer features would necessarily be disabled when an older driver was active. As a consequence, when a mirror driver designed for the older model was active, such as when Windows Remote Assistance or Windows Live Mesh were in use, Vista disabled Desktop Window Manager and Windows Aero.[tpl]Cite web | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Matt | last2 = Calvo  | first2 = Mike | title = The Facts About Mirror Drivers in Assistive Technology | date = 2008-03-21 | url = http://serotek.com/mirror-driver-paper.html | accessdate = 2008-04-24 | format = [tpl]dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl] – Scholar search | postscript =  [/tpl] A similar situation existed with the transition from Windows 7 to Windows 8. Beginning with the DDK targeted at Windows 8, mirror drivers have to fulfill very exacting specifications - they must support a specific set of functions, and no more than those.
Windows installations come with two mirror drivers preinstalled - "mnmdd" used by NetMeeting, and "RDPDD Chained DD" used for Terminal Server/RemoteDesktop services. Third-party mirror drivers are included with screen readers such as JAWS, Window-Eyes and FreedomBox; the monitoring software LanSchool; and remote desktop software such as Timbuktu, LogMeIn, UltraVNC, TightVNC, Radmin and RemotePC.

[[Gangkofen]]
CATEGORIES: Rottal-Inn

Gangkofen is a municipality in the county ("Landkreis") of Rottal-Inn in Bavaria in Germany.
 Geography
The market town (Markt) Gangkofen lies in the valley of the river Bina along the federal highway B 388 about 17 km (11 mi) west of Eggenfelden, 26 km (16 mi) south of Dingolfing, 40 km (25 mi) southeast of Landshut, 25 km (16 mi) north of Mühldorf and 32 km (20 mi) west of the county (district) seat, Pfarrkirchen.
Gangkofen is the westernmost municipality of the rural county or district ("Landkreis") named Rottal-Inn, and borders the county of Dingolfing-Landau in the north, the county of Mühldorf in the south and the county of Landshut in the west. Gangkofen is considered part of the historic and geographic Rottal region, because the market town was part of the former county of Eggenfelden (in the Rott valley) and has stronger economic and cultural ties to the east, than in other directions. The western portions of the political municipality - the former rural towns of Dirnaich and Hölsbrunn- historically belonged to the county of Vilsbiburg (now part of the county of Landshut), thus the inhabitants of those parts tend to look to be oriented in that direction (the west) even today.
The political municipality comprises the market town itself and the following villages: Angerbach, Dirnaich, Engersdorf, Hölsbrunn, Kollbach, Malling, Obertrennbach, Panzing, Radlkofen, Reicheneibach und Seemannshausen.
History
Gangkofen is first mentioned in a document in 889 AD. The town is believed to have been part of the properties the Diocese of Bamberg was equipped with upon its foundation in 1007 AD. In 1279 Count Wenhard II. of Leonberg made the Teutonic Knights the patrons over the local parish, thus founding this military order's monastic residence ("Kommende") in Gangkofen. Up to its secularization in 1805/06 this was the only branch of the Teutonic Knights in Lower Bavaria.
In 1379 Gangkofen was awarded the title and privileges of a market town. Its coat of arms was awarded by Duke Ludwig IX. of Bavaria-Landshut around 1450. However, Gangkofen's development was repeatedly thwarted by devastating fires (e.g. around 1590 and in the year 1666) and the trials of war (during the 30 Years' War it was occupied by the Swedes in 1632 and 1648), as well as outbreaks of the plague (1357 and 1649).
The market town Gangkofen was a separate lower administrative and judicial unit ("Pflegamt") prior to 1803 and was part of the tax district ("Rentamt") Landshut of the Prince-Electoriate Bavaria. The residence of the Teutonic Knights ("Kommende"), which was equipped with the liberties of a gentry seat ("Hofmarksrecht") and exercised the judicial stewardship over its own properties, was dissolved by the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806. Additionally, Gangkofen was seat of a market court. In the process of administrative reforms in Bavaria, the municipality edict ("Gemeindeedikt") of 1818 and the territory reforms of the 1970s established the contemporary municipality.
On October 15, 1875, Gangkofen was linked to the railroad system with the completion of the rail line Mühldorf–Pilsting. Since September 27, 1970 this connection has only been used for freight traffic.
Politics
Municipal council
The most recent municipal elections in 2008 resulted in the following allocation of seats:
    * [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] (Christian Social Union) 9
    * [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] (Social Democrats)       2
    * [[FWG]] (Free Voters)            5
    * UWG (Independent Voters)     1
    * Voters' community Kollbach   2
    * BP  (Bavaria Party)          1
Cultural sights
The 0,6 hectare(1.5 acres) market place, located in the center of town, is 18 m (59 ft) wide and 210 m (689 ft) long, approximating the typical ratio of 1:8. Many of the houses still have the typical arched gables. The Catholic parish church was rebuilt after the great fire of 1666, completed by 1670, and the steeple added 1695 to 1697. Immediately to the northwest of the Church lies the former monastery of the Teutonic Knights, a three winged structure, newly built in 1691 in the late baroque style.
Media
Two local newspapers are circulated in Gangkofen: The "Rottaler Anzeiger" (regional edition of the Passauer Neue Presse, PNP) has its editorial office in Eggenfelden, [tpl]convert|11|mi|km[/tpl] to the east. The Vilsbiburger Zeitung (belonging to the media group Landshuter Zeitung/Straubinger Tagblatt) is from Vilsbiburg, [tpl]convert|11|mi|km[/tpl] to the west. For years, an occasional competitive struggle for the patronage of the citizens of this community erupted between the two papers, but now the spoils seem divided and peace prevails.
People
Famous sons and daughters of the town

It then goes on a journey down the river to Louisiana and the river's delta as the massive watercourse empties into the Gulf of Mexico.  The turtle gets to see much of the Midwestern United States and American South along its way.  
Like most of Holling's works, Minn is lushly illustrated, containing many full-page color paintings. Pages with text in them are also generously illustrated, with black-and-white pen-and-ink drawings, many with explanatory captions (to accompany the action of the story), in the margins.

[[Demokratia]]
CATEGORIES: Direct democracy, Democracy

Demokratia ([tpl]lang-el|δημοκρατία[/tpl]) is a direct democracy, as opposed to the modern representative democracy.
It was used in ancient Greece, most notably Athens, and began its use around 500 BCE.
In a participant government, citizens who wish to have a say in government can participate in it. Demokratia excluded women, foreigners, and slaves. It barred between 80 and 90 percent of the population from political rights.Morris & Raaflaub Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challenges
The word demokratia comes from δῆμος demos "people" and kratos "power": "the people hold power." Demos, including the lower classes, had political equality and while respecting laws and institutions, was given full and absolute control of power and government."Morris & Raaflaub Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challengesp.34
In some languages, including Finnish, Demokratia is a word simply meaning democracy.
Quoted from MODERN AMERICA AND THE RELIGION OF DEMOCRACY (Internet archive) by Loren J Samons II:
 
 In classical Athens, religion suffused every aspect of public life, from the theater to the military to the political assembly. The state (that is, the citizens) sponsored religious festivals and actively participated in the propitiation and worship of the gods. This fact well illustrates the way the various aspects of Athenian society — religious, political, economic, and social — overlapped with and affected one another, and the way every Athenian found himself set firmly within a matrix of duties to the gods, to his family, and to his fellow citizens. The principle of necessary duties (especially to protect the family, to serve the polis, and to propitiate the gods) formed the basic structure of Athenian society, and gave meaning to each religious, economic, military, and political act. In such an environment, it was impossible for the Athenians abjectly to worship a form of government, demokratia, even after they had made it a goddess. The idea that the "freedom to make choices" or "diversity" were absolute goods and thus could serve as goals or ideals (on a level with, much less above, family, gods, or polis) contradicted the very premises of Athenian society. Thus while democratic practices ultimately had a marked and deleterious effect on Athenian national strength and public morale and arguably contributed to the loss of Athenian independence, Athenian society managed to stave off the most harmful aspects of democratic theory. Even after they lost their democracy and autonomy, there is little evidence that the Athenians completely lost their fundamental conception of a society based on the principle of duties.

Law enforcement in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is inconsistently enforced, as the region is a de facto independent republic officially part of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and is governed by the unrecognized National Assembly of Nagorno Karabakh. According to a report prepared by British parliamentarian and rapporteur David Atkinson, presented to Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), "the borders of Azerbaijan were internationally recognised at the time of the country being recognised as independent state in 1991," and "the territory of Azerbaijan included the Nagorno-Karabakh region."Mr David Atkinson, United Kingdom, European Democrat Group, (Rapporteur) The conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, 29 November 2004 Therefore, law enforcement in Nagorno-Karabakh would in theory be the responsibility of the Azerbaijan police. 
However, the community of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic created, on May 9, 1992, the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army, uniting previously disorganized self-defense units which were formed in the early 1990s in order to protect the ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh from the attacks by the military of the Soviet and Azerbaijani forces. Currently Nagorno-Karabakh Defence Army is around 15,000-20,000 well-trained and equipped officers and soldiers. It consists of infantry, tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft systems.Office of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Washington D.C. (Accessed February 13, 2006) Since the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994, most of Nagorno-Karabakh and several regions of Azerbaijan around it remain under joint Armenian and NKR Defense Forces control, thus splitting the responsibility unevenly between security forces of the two parties, the OSCE Minsk Group mission, and the United Nations.

Beginning on the south side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the Uffizi Gallery  and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the River Arno until it crosses the Ponte Vecchio. At the time of construction the Torre dei Mannelli had to be built around using brackets because the owners of the tower refused to alter it. The corridor covers up part of the façade of the chiesa di Santa Felicita. The corridor then snakes its way over rows of houses in the Oltrarno district, becoming narrower, to finally join the Palazzo Pitti. Most of it is closed to visitors.

Joseph Nolan (1846 – 14 September 1928) was an Irish nationalist politician and Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he represented North Louth from 1885–92, and South Louth from 1900-18. The Irish Times (15 September 1928) said he was "One of the Fenians whom Parnellism conquered." 
Nolan was born at Castleblayney, County Monaghan.The Times, 4 Dec. 1885 said he was a native of County Louth, but Nolan's own Census entry for 1911 states that he was born at Castleblayney. No doubt he grew up in Co. Louth.  Identification of the Census entries for 1901 and 1911 is certain because the 1911 Census address, 404 Clapham Road, Wandsworth, is the same as that given by Stenton & Lees (1978).  In 1901 Nolan's address was 42 Stockwell Road, Lambeth. He married Mary Flinn, who had been born in County Down, in 1884.  She was 12–14 years his junior.Stenton & Lees (1978); Census 1901 and 1911. Nolan's wife's name Mary is known from the 1901 and 1911 Censuses, and her place of birth from the 1911 Census.  Her maiden name Flinn is inferred from that of Margarite Flinn, Joseph Nolan's mother-in-law, who was included in the 1901 Census return.  Together they had nine children, of whom two died young, leaving by 1911 three sons and four daughters.Census 1911 Nolan was originally a schoolteacher, in Ireland and then at a reformatory school in Liverpool.  He later became manager of the Aquarium and Casino in New Brighton on the Wirral Peninsula near Liverpool, and this was his job at the time of his first election to Parliament for the new seat of North Louth in the Nationalist landslide of 1885.  In this election, as the official Irish National League candidate supported by Charles Stewart Parnell, he defeated Philip Callan, who had previously sat for Co. Louth as a Home Ruler but had fallen out with Parnell and now stood as an Independent Nationalist.  Nolan was then returned unopposed in 1886.
When the Irish Parliamentary Party split over the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell in 1890, Nolan supported Parnell.  At the following election in 1892 he stood in South Louth but was defeated by an Anti-Parnellite by more than 2 to 1.  At the general election of July 1895 he stood in the North Louth seat again, challenging the prominent Anti-Parnellite incumbent Timothy Michael Healy, but was again defeated, this time by 3 to 2.  In a by-election the following September, he came within 88 votes of winning Limerick City as a Parnellite.
At the general election of October 1900, following the reunification of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he stood in the South Louth seat as an Independent Nationalist against the official Nationalist candidate, and won with 57% of the vote. He was subsequently reconciled to the official Party and returned unopposed at South Louth until 1918, when he retired.
In a characteristically colourful obituary in the Daily Telegraph, T. P. O'Connor said, like the Irish Times, that 'Nolan was one of the Fenians whom Parnellism conquered'.  He went on to write:  '....and when Parnell was on the look-out for candidates to join his new and soon-to-be-powerful party his mind was directed to Nolan, who had a record of obscure but violent acts behind him....He was a very fine-looking fellow, 6 ft 2in or 3in high, very well proportioned, with a handsome and refined face....He could speak, but with such slowness as to make a speech from him almost an infliction....he was always in or about the House of Commons....Forced to make a living - for there was no salary for Members of Parliament in those days, and a very small allowance from the party funds - Nolan was always engaged in some enterprise which he was trying to push....At one time it was to purchase rum of Jamaica;  at another he had some scheme for exploring and exploiting a large piece of land in Labrador.  Like all his colleagues, I heard Labrador described with his maddening slowness of speech, until in the end I had to protect myself by rarely seeing him.'  O'Connor added that at the end of his life Nolan 'got into a state of almost complete destitution'. 
In 1901 he was working as a 'dealer's agent, own account' and in 1911 as a wine shipper.Ceusus, 1901 and 1911.  It can be inferred from the Census records that he never lived in Ireland after about 1884.
His last recorded public appearance seems to have been at a service of thanksgiving for the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty held in Westminster Cathedral, London, on 8 December 1921, which was also attended by his former Irish Parliamentary Party colleagues T. P. O'Connor and Thomas Scanlan.The Times, 9/12/1921.

The lagoon has decreased in size since the 1930s to less than a quarter of its former extent. However, in the last ten years ([tpl]As of|2007[/tpl]) water salinity has increased both by the rise of the level of the Caspian Sea which has caused greater interchange of waters, and due to greater salt transport in incoming "fresh" water due to increased upstream irrigation.Final Report of the 5th Meeting on Anzali Lagoon Adaptive Management Pilot Initiation Project (17 April 2007), Caspian Environment Program (CEP), p. 4, accessed 28 November 2008

[[Hospitals for the Poor Act 1597]]

CATEGORIES: 1597 in law, 1597 in England, Acts of the Parliament of England (1485–1603)

The Hospitals for the Poor Act 1597 (39 Eliz 1 c 5) was an Act of the Parliament of England. It was enacted during the reign of Elizabeth I and in force until the twentieth century. 
The Disabled Soldiers Act 1592 had permitted the bequest of lands and buildings to establish "houses of correction or abiding-houses" for the poor or for maimed soldiers, but as it had not been legally possible to establish a hospital without a specific royal grant, the Act had had limited effect. As such, this Act was enacted, allowing any person wishing to establish a foundation to create it by deed at the High Court of Chancery; such foundations would be permanent. However, a minimum endowment was required, sufficient to produce £10 per annum. The Act, which initially was to take effect for a span of twenty years, was later revived and made perpetual by the Hospitals Act 1623, and then remained in force until the whole Act was repealed by section 39(1) of, and Schedule 5 to, the Charities Act 1960.

He became a fellow of Winchester College in 1711 and was buried in Westminster Cathedral upon his death at age 47.
His sole contribution to English letters was an eight-volume Poems on several occasions and translations, wherein the first and second books of Virgil's 'AEneis' are attempted in 1692.  The collection contained mostly juvenalia, its dedication said, and a good number of school exercises.  His translation of the first book of Aeneid was in heroic couplets, while part of the translation of book 2 was in blank verse.  The volumes also contained a partial translation of Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy and the second epode of Horace.

[[Rodewald Concert Society]]
CATEGORIES: 1911 establishments in England, Chamber music, Music societies, Clubs and societies in England

The Rodewald Concert Society is a promoter of chamber music in the Liverpool and Merseyside area of England.  The Society was established in 1911, in memory of  Alfred E Rodewald (1861–1903), a well-respected amateur conductor in Liverpool, and close friend of Edward Elgar who dedicated the first of his Pomp and Circumstance Marches to Rodewald.  
For many years the Society has brought some of the finest chamber music ensembles to Liverpool, including string quartets such as the Amadeus Quartet, the Smetana Quartet, the Janáček Quartet and the Melos Quartet, and other chamber groups such as the Beaux Arts Trio. More recently, the Skampa Quartet, the Belcea Quartet and the Florestan Trio have visited the Society.  Recent seasons have offered audiences quality series of quartet concerts, lieder and piano recitals by Stephen Hough, Paul Lewis, Nikolai Demidenko and Llr Williams.  Joglaresa have also performed, a concert highly appreciated by followers of early music.
The Society has also a record of commissioning new works, including works by Hugh Wood, to celebrate Liverpool as European Capital of Culture in 2008, and John McCabe, its President. A commission in 2012 was for a clarinet quintet by Emily Howard, performed by Nicholas Cox and the Danel String Quartet.   Wirral composer Emily Howard has been one of the real discoveries of recent seasons and this new work was received with great acclaim.
The Rodewald Concert Society went through some financial difficulties during the 1990s, but the present chairman, committee and members of the public re-established it, allowing it to resume its activities.  The Society relaunched its programme with the Beethoven Series Quartets Concerts and the Endellion Quartet in 2000. 
While it is an independent charity, the Society enjoyed a close working relationship with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society, with whom it played a major role in completing the provision of a full range of classical musical performances for audiences in the Merseyside area.   In 2012, in its Centenary year, the decision was made by the Society to become fully independent and to assume a new role of commissioning new works and sponsorship of the Chamber Concert Series, which are now fully promoted by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.  It is now entirely reliant on the support of its members and patrons for its activities. 
In its new role, the Society promoted, in association with the University of Liverpool and Hope University a concert by the Smith Quartet as part of Liverpool Hope University’s Cornerstone Arts
Festival 2012. The Smith Quartet is recognised as being at the leading edge of the new music world.  At this concert, the Society commissioned two new compositions, one by Liverpool Hope University composer
Ian Percy and the second by University of Liverpool composer Matthew Fairclough.   Both new works combined string quartet with live electronics.
Concerts were for many years held in the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool, but since 2007 the Society held most of its concerts in the newly refurbished Small Concert Hall at St. George's Hall, Liverpool.

[[Radical planning]]

CATEGORIES: Urban studies and planning

Radical planning is a stream of urban planning which seeks to manage development in an equitable and community-based manner.
The seminal text to the radical planning movement is Foundations for a Radical Concept in Planning (1973), by Stephen Grabow and Allen Heskin.  Grabow and Heskin provided a critique of planning as elitist, centralising and change-resistant, and proposed a new paradigm based upon systems change, decentralization, communal society, facilitation of human development and a consideration of ecology.  Grabow and Heskin were joined by Head of Department of Town Planning from the Polytechnic of the South Bank Shean McConnell, and his 1981 work Theories for Planning.
In 1987 John Friedman entered the fray with Planning in the Public Domain: From Knowledge to Action, promoting a radical planning model based on “decolonization”, “democratization”, “self-empowerment” and “reaching out”.  Friedman described this model as an “agropolitan development” paradigm, emphasising the re-localisation of primary production and manufacture.  In “Toward a Non-Euclidian Mode of Planning" (1993) Friedman further promoted the urgency of decentralizing planning, advocating a planning paradigm that is normative, innovative, political, transactive and based on a Social learning approach to knowledge and policy.

John Flete (ca. 1398 – 1466) was an English monk and ecclesiastical historian who documented the history and abbots of Westminster Abbey.
He entered the monastery at Westminster some time around 1420.  For some years, he was an ordinary cloistered monk, but he became the almoner around 1435.Harvey, "John Flete."  Later, he became prior of the abbey from 1456 to 1466 and served under two successive abbots who were replaced for poor management. He was himself caught up in some of the allegations of mismanagement. In 1444 the misbehavior of the abbot Kirton led to examination from outside "visitors," and they had Flete suspended from his position for a time.
His major work was the four volume History of Westminster Abbey from its founding by, according to him, "King Lucius" in 184, to around 1386. He had wanted to continue the history up to 1443, but his removal from office kept him from his plan. In general, the history copies from other sources, including a lost Liber regius, Sulcard's Prologus de Construccione Westmonasterii,Harvey, "Sulcard (fl. c. 1080)." charters, pipe rolls, papal letters, and other documents the abbey had in its possession. However, his own contribution to history was in including a small biography of each abbot of the monastery. These biographies were generally standardized—providing the date of election, major accomplishments, date of death, place of entombment, and epitaph for each. According to Barbara Harvey, the chief value of the history was in demonstrating how ecclesiastical historiography was moving away from a national interest toward a local and biographical one in the late Middle Ages.

Here, an "independent jury" implies that its members are not officially selected by the committee of the Berlinale. In the most part, the jury consists of  organisers of gay and lesbian film festivals, who view films screened in all sections of the Berlinale. Subsequently, a list of films meeting criteria for LGBT content is selected by the jury, and a 3,000-Euro Teddy is awarded to a feature film, a short film and a documentary. The award was first given in 1987.

Chief Arthur Edward Prest (February 10, 1906 – September 26, 1976) was an Itsekiri politician of mixed heritage from the Warri division of Southern Nigeria. He was an officer of the Nigerian police force prior to his nomination as a representative of the Warri district in the Western Regional House of Assembly.Abner Cohen, Urban Ethnicity. Routledge, 2004. ISBN 0-415-32982-5 In 1951, he declared his support for the Action Group and was later made regional minister at Ibadan, he was subsequently appointed federal minister for communications in 1952.
He left the Action Group in 1957.
In 1971, he was involved in a prominent court case. Then, he challenged the Itsekiri Communal Lands Trust which wanted to use the purported overlord rights of the Olu of Warri over lands in Warri. The overlord rights would have given the trust indirect ownership of all lands including overriding the rights of ownership of landlords. However, the communal lands trust lost the case.

[[Edmonds' algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Graph algorithms

In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, Edmonds' algorithm or Chu–Liu/Edmonds' algorithm is an algorithm for finding a maximum or minimum optimum branchings. This is similar to the minimum spanning tree problem which concerns undirected graphs. However, when nodes are connected by weighted edges that are directed, a minimum spanning tree algorithm cannot be used.
The optimum branching algorithm was proposed independently first by Yoeng-jin Chu and Tseng-hong Liu (1965) and then by Edmonds (1967). To find a maximum path length, the largest edge value is found and connected between the two nodes, then the next largest value, and so on. If an edge creates a loop, it is erased.  A minimum path length is found by starting from the smallest value.

He is the first Hollis native to reach baseball's major league. He played for the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Keene Swamp Bats while in college.

Commercegate was the selling of seats on United States federal planes going on international trade missions, the goal to raise campaign contributions.
Nolanda Hill, a close business associate of Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, testified in court in 1998 that Brown had told her that trade mission plane seats were sold to business people who gave at least $50,000 each to the DNC.[tpl]cite news|last=Frieden |first=Terry |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/23/trade.sale/ |title=Ex-Ron Brown Partner Claims Clintons Backed 'Sale' Of Trade Seats |publisher=CNN.com |date=1998-03-23[/tpl]
A federal judge found that a US Commerce Department official appeared to have deliberately destroyed documents, which had been subpoenaed in a lawsuit, concerning the department's trade missions to China.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050323205903/http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/95cv133.pdf |archivedate=2005-03-23 |url=http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/95cv133.pdf |format=PDF |title= Memorandum Opinion Judicial Watch vs. Department of Commerce, page 14 |work= U.S. District Court |date=2006-04-14[/tpl]
U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth heard Hill's testimony. Hill said Brown was angered when White House political staff made him to give seats on the trade missions for fund-raising. Hill said main person at the White House was Alexis Herman, later Clinton's Labor secretary. Hill said, an assistant to Herman, Melissa Moss, wrote the contribution letters which angered Brown. Hill also testified in court that Brown told her President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton supported the plan to sell seats.
In February 1999, Nolanda Hill pleaded guilty to 1 counts of aiding and abetting the preparation and filing of a false income tax return, as part the Commercegate investigation. 
Brown died on one of international trade missions, when the government plane crashed into a mountainside in Croatia on April 3, 1996.
The final report by independent counsel Daniel Pearson, reported:
"My office's investigation of Secretary Brown ended unfinished with his death. The unfinished state of the investigation and considerations of fairness preclude our office from drawing conclusions about the allegations regarding possible criminal conduct by the Secretary."

Isaac Norris (July 21, 1671 – June 4, 1735) was a merchant and prominent figure in provincial Pennsylvania, including mayor of Philadelphia in 1724.
He was born in London, England, but his father, Thomas, moved to Jamaica when Isaac was seven years old. Isaac went to Philadelphia in 1690 to arrange for his family to move to that city, but on his return he found that they had all died in the great earthquake at Port Royal. He returned to Philadelphia, went into business, and became one of the wealthiest proprietors in Pennsylvania.
While he was in England in 1706 he came to the aid of William Penn in his difficulties and rescued him from imprisonment. On his return to Philadelphia two years later, he was elected to the governor's council, and from then until his death continued in public life. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly for many years, its speaker in 1712, justice for Philadelphia County in 1717, and, on the organization of the high court of chancery, became a master to hear cases with the lieutenant-governor. He was elected mayor of Philadelphia in 1724. On the death of David Lloyd, he was unanimously chosen Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, but he declined and remained in the county court. For many years he was one of the chief representatives of the proprietaries, and by the will of Penn he was named a trustee of the province of Pennsylvania.

The roots of the very few glass evil eye bead masters that still practice this tradition go back to the Arabian artisans who settled in Izmir and its towns during the decline of the Ottoman Empire by the end of the 19th century. The glass art that had lost its glamour in Anatolia, combined with the eye sign, was enlivened. The masters who practised their arts at Araphan and Kemeralti districts of Izmir were exiled due to the disturbance of the smoke from their furnace and risk of fire in the neighbourhood.

The Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary of Padua ([tpl]lang-it|Basilica Cattedrale di S.

The cathedral is the see of the Diocese of Padua, and is dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
It is the third edifice built on the same site. The first one was erected after the Edict of Milan in 313 and destroyed by an earthquake on the 3 January 1117. It was rebuilt in Romanesque style: the appearance of the medieval church can be seen in the frescoes by Giusto de' Menabuoi in the annexed Baptistery.
The design of the existing cathedral is sometimes attributed to Michelangelo, but in fact it was the work of Andrea della Valle and Agostino Righetto, with much in common with earlier Paduan churches. Although construction work began on the new Renaissance edifice in 1551, it was only completed in 1754, leaving the façade unfinished.

Old Broadway Synagogue is an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Harlem, New York City incorporated in 1911 under the name Chevra Talmud Torah Anshei Marovi, by an immigrant named Morris Schiff, (Torah Study Society, People of the West Side Harlem) Schiff was a polish immigrant who lived in the Harlem area, an area with a high Jewish population at the time. The temple located at 15 Old Broadway (a rare vestige on Manhattan island of the Bloomingdale Road), the Old Broadway Synagogue is a "vernacular" style synagogue  built in 1923 by the architectural firm of Meisner & Uffner.  The congregation formed from the mostly Ashkenazic Jewish population of Russian and Polish immigrants to New York during the 1880s who had made their way up to Central Harlem, then migrated to blocks west. The members initially met in storefronts and purportedly in the back room of a bar until the congregation purchased a house on Old Broadway. This structure was torn down shortly thereafter to make way for the synagogue. The congregation had an active Talmud Torah (Hebrew school) probably from its founding until the 1960s or 1970s. Among its early rabbis were the author Simon Glazer and Shepard Brodie. The building is listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places. 
The Synagogue is perhaps best known today for its late rabbi, Jacob Kret, a former rosh yeshiva (head of a rabbinic academy) in Bialystok and later Ostrow Mazowiecka, Poland.  After the division of Poland between Germany and USSR, Rabbi Kret was arrested by the Soviet authorities while attempting to bring his students to relative safety in Lithuania. He was then deported to a Soviet labor camp, and was later released. After the war, Rabbi Kret headed a yeshiva that was in or associated with the Displaced Persons camp in Zeilsheim, a section of Frankfurt. By the time Rabbi Kret became the spiritual leader of the Old Broadway Synagogue in 1950, many of the founding families had moved away. Rabbi Kret recruited Holocaust survivors who were moving to New York at that time to settle in the vicinity of the synagogue. These survivors, many of whom came from Polish Hasidic backgrounds, helped fill the synagogue in the 1950s and 1960s. By the time most of these had moved away, in the 1970s and 1980s, Rabbi Kret had become a mashgiach (kosher food supervisor) in the nearby Barnard College dining hall as well as a Talmud tutor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America students. As such Rabbi Kret had a deep influence on many Columbia University, Barnard College and Jewish Theological Seminary students until he retired from the Synagogue in November 1997. He died in February 2007.
Since 2000, the Synagogue has attracted young people who live in Harlem and Washington Heights, as well as from Morningside Heights and the Upper West Side. The Synagogue offers a weekly class on Pirkei Avot (Ethics of the Fathers), a section of the Talmud containing ethical maxims.
Dr. Paul Radensky, Museum Educator for Jewish Schools for the Museum of Jewish Heritage - A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, is the current president of the congregation and has overseen fundraising and renovations for the Synagogue.

[[Onboard refueling vapor recovery]]

CATEGORIES: Vehicle emission controls, Pollution control technologies

Onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR) is a vehicle emission control system that captures fuel vapors from the vehicle gas tank during refueling.  The gas tank and fill pipe are designed so that when refueling the vehicle, fuel vapors in the gas tank travel to an activated carbon packed canister, which absorbs the vapor.  When the engine is in operation, it draws the gasoline vapors into the engine intake manifold to be used as fuel.  ORVR has been mandated on all passenger cars in the United States since 2006 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The use of onboard vapor recovery is intended to make vapor recovery at gas stations obsolete.

[[Lithos]]
CATEGORIES: Adobe typefaces, Sans-serif typefaces, Incised typefaces, Display typefaces, 1989 introductions

Lithos is a glyphic sans-serif typeface designed by Carol Twombly in 1989 for Adobe Systems. Lithos is inspired by the unadorned, geometric letterforms of the engravings found on Ancient Greek public buildings. The typeface consists of only capital letters, and comes in five weights, with no italics.
According to Twombly, Lithos only used Greek inscriptions as inspiration, making Lithos more of a modern reinterpretation than a faithful reproduction. Twombly also designed Trajan and Charlemagne based respectively on ancient Roman and Byzantine inscriptions. Those typefaces, unlike Lithos, were modeled more directly upon their historical counterparts. One example of Lithos' departure from historical accuracy is the inclusion of bold weights, which never existed in historical Greek inscriptions.
Publications associated with African, African-American and Southwestern cultures have used Lithos for its "ethnic" feel, even if it is the wrong ethnicity. Lithos has also become something of a generic stand-in whenever a "primitive" feel is desired. For this reason, Lithos has been compared to Rudolf Koch's typeface, Neuland, which was originally intended to be a modern reinterpretation of blackletter, but received similarly broad use.

Athos, although the dates are indistinct (either 1701 or 1711) and at Karyes.  In 1721, he painted the chapel of St. Demetrios in Vatopedi.  He then returned to live in Fourna.  His last official entry into public record is in 1741, when he gained permission to start a school at Agrafa.
Dionysius's Hermeneia (1730 - 1734) attempts to provide a synthetic (or "harmonized") Gospel account of the life of Jesus Christ.  His time line and events are mainly from the Book of Matthew, but he weaves in major incidents from the other synoptic Gospels.  The manual is also called Mount Athos Painter's Guide and is in three parts.  In general, it is a chronological listing of scenes appropriate for painting, along with a proper inscription for the painter to include to make the icon, as well as the proper position in the church for each scene.  The first part of the work gives recipes for colors, gesso, and instructions on body proportions for human figure painting.  The second part is a manual for the life of Christ, descriptions and inscriptions for various Biblical and hagiographic subjects, and suggested images.  The third part describes the locations in a church for each depiction.  The manuscript survives in more than twenty-five instances.
It is likely that Dionysius surveyed existing churches from the medieval period, where the life of Christ would be told in emblems around the church.  Although the work is not original, nor designed to be original, the description of each scene is probably from Dionysius's own imagination and imagery.

Viennoiseries (French etymological sense: 'things of Vienna') are baked goods made from a yeast-leavened dough in a manner similar to bread, or from puff pastry, but with added ingredients (particularly eggs, butter, milk, cream and sugar) giving them a richer, sweeter character, approaching that of  pastry.http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/tlfiv5/advanced.exe?8;s=3108413280; The dough is  often laminated. Viennoiseries are typically eaten at breakfast or as snacks.
Examples include: croissants; Vienna bread and its French equivalent, pain viennois, often shaped into baguettes; brioche; pain au chocolat; pain au lait; pain aux raisins; chouquettes; Danish pastries; bugnes; and chausson aux pommes, the French name for an apple turnover.
The popularity of Viennese-style baked goods in France began with the Viennese Bakery opened by August Zang in 1839. The first usage of the expression "pâtisseries viennoises" appears in a book by French author Alphonse Daudet, Le Nabab in 1877.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/viennoise |title=Viennois, -oise (definition) |work=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl]

Elections to Monmouthshire County Council were held on 10 June 2004 on the same day of the European Elections. 
The whole council was up for election and following boundary changes the number of seats was increased to 43. The Conservatives gained overall control of the council from a previous minority Labour administration.  
The Conservatives formed a minority administration from the previous county council election in May 1999, being largest group on the council by one seat.
Following two by-elections in 2002 (the Conservatives losing one seat to the Liberal Democrats and Labour taking a seat from an Independent), the Labour party became the largest group by one seat.
Having secured the support of Independent and Liberal Democrat councillors, Labour formed a minority administration from July 2002 until the election in June 2004.
After the election, the composition of the council was:
The election results were noticeable seeing two Plaid Cymru councillors elected in Caldicot, a first for the Welsh nationalists in heavily anglicised Monmouthshire, and the election of a 21 year old student, Matthew Jones http://www.ldys.org.uk/web/news/20040614001.html, for the Liberal Democrats in Chepstow.
The Labour party suffered heavy losses to the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Independents.
The election result saw a fragmentation of the non-conservative vote; the emergence of the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru onto the council. Of note was the number of close races in individual wards, as well as several individual contests where the winning candidate polled far less than a majority of the votes cast.

[[Empty category]]
CATEGORIES: Syntax

In linguistics, in the study of syntax, an empty category is a nominal element that does not have any phonological content and is therefore unpronounced.Kosta, Peter, and Krivochen, Diego Gabriel. Eliminating Empty Categories: A Radically Minimalist View on Their Ontology and Justification. Frankfurt: Peter Lang GmbH, 2013. Print. Empty categories may also be referred to as covert nouns, in contrast to overt nouns which are pronounced. The phenomenon was named by Noam Chomsky in his 1981 LGB framework. Empty categories are governed by the empty category principle. When representing empty categories in trees, linguists use a null symbol to depict the idea that there is a mental category at the level being represented, even if the word(s) are being left out of overt speech. There are four main types of empty categories: NP-trace, Wh-trace, PRO, and pro.  The types are differentiated by their two binding features: the anaphoric feature a and the pronominal feature p. The four possible combinations of plus or minus values for these features yield the four types of empty categories.Kosta, Peter. “Empty Categories, Null-Subjects and Null-Objects and How to Treat Them in the Minimalist Program.” Linguistics in Potsdam 2.3 (1995/1996): 7-38. Web. 6 December 2013. Empty categories are present in most of the world's languages, although different languages allow for different categories to be empty.
In the table, +a refers to the anaphoric feature, meaning that the particular element must be bound within its governing category. +p refers to the pronominal feature which shows that the empty category is taking the place of an overt pronoun.

Eutypella'' canker''' is a plant disease caused by the fungal pathogen Eutypella parasitica'. This disease is capable of infecting many species of maple trees and produces a large, distinguishable canker on the main trunk of the tree. Infection and spread of the disease is accomplished with the release of ascospores from perithecia. Therefore, the best way to manage the Eutypella canker is to remove trees that have been infected. If infected, it can decrease the quality of wood cut for lumber and can thus have a negative economic impact.

It is an ascomycete plant pathogen native to tropical regions and specific for survival on only one host, the mango. Originally described in 1943 from Florida and Cuba specimens, this pathogen has since spread worldwide and is becoming a pathogen of great concern for the mango industries in Australia and India. E. mangiferae is an obligate parasite of mango, and therefore cannot be grown outside of living plant tissue. The species was first described formally in 1946.

[[You Better Sit Down Kids]]

"You Better Sit Down Kids'" is a major hit single release by American singer/actress Cher in 1967. The song was written by her then-husband, Sonny Bono, and reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and in Canada #7.Cher's song chart entries Retrieved September 28, 2011
The song dealt with divorce, a somewhat taboo subject in the 1960s, and garnered much attention in the media.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] It was meant to be sung by the father, however, Cher sang the song as the father.  Also, at the end of the song, the wild, fast sounds of a jazz saxophone playing were reminiscent of a Spike Jones recording, suggesting the fussing that the kids would be doing as a result of the separation and the divorce of the couple.
Along with the likes of "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" and "Where Do You Go" this song was one of many solo hits for Cher in the 1960s to be written by Bono and it became Cher's second solo top ten of the decade. Along with the Sonny & Cher hit "The Beat Goes On," this was a temporary comeback to the U.S. top ten for Cher and neither she nor the duo would reach those heights again until 1971.
Singer Roy Drusky brought the song to country music audiences in 1968. His version peaked at #28, spending 10 weeks on the Billboard country chart.
Gary Puckett & The Union Gap also released a version of the song on their 1968 album, Woman, Woman.Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, Woman, Woman Retrieved September 28, 2011
Toward the end of Sonny & Cher touring together, Sonny Bono performed You Better Sit Down Kids live in 1973.  A studio version with Sonny on lead vocals is available on "All I Ever Need: The Kapp/MCA Anthology".

[[Second Hundred Years' War]]

"The Second Hundred Years' War" (c. 1689 - c. 1815) is an periodization or "historical era" term used by some historians[ref]Buffinton, Arthur H. "The Second Hundred Years' War, 1689-1815". New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1929.

[/ref][ref]Scott, H. M. Review: "The Second 'Hundred Years War" 1689-1815", article in  "The Historical Journal", 35, (1992), pp. 443-469.
[/ref] to describe the series of military conflicts between the Kingdom of England (later Kingdom of Great Britain after 1707, and still later  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after 1801), and the nation of France (with the various regimes of the  Kingdom of France, the First French Republic and the First French Empire of Emperor Napoleon I) that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815.  The term appears to have been coined by J. R. Seeley in his influential work The Expansion of England: Two Courses of Lectures (1883).Morieux, Renaud: "Diplomacy from Below and Belonging: Fishermen and Cross-Channel Relations in the Eighteenth Century" article in "Past & Present", 202, (2009), p. 83.
Like  "The Hundred Years' War", this term does not describe a single military event but a persistent general state of war between the two primary belligerents. The use of the phrase as an overarching category indicates the interrelation of all the wars as components of the rivalry between France and Britain for world power.  It was a war between and over the future of each state's colonial empires.
The various wars between the two states during the 18th century usually involved other European countries in large alliances; except for the "War of the Quadruple Alliance" when they were bound by the Anglo-French Alliance, France and Britain always opposed one another.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Some of the wars, such as the "The Seven Years' War", have been considered world wars and included battles in the growing colonies in India, the Americas, and ocean shipping routes around the globe.
The series of wars began with the accession of the Dutch William III as King of England in the Revolution of 1688.  The later Stuarts, as converts to Roman Catholicism, had sought friendly terms with Louis XIV.  James I and Charles I, both Protestants, had avoided involvement as much as possible in the Thirty Years' War; they, too, had sought peaceful terms with France during the seventeenth century. Charles II and James II had even actively supported Louis XIV in his War against the Dutch Republic. William III, however, sought to oppose Louis XIV's Catholic regime and styled himself as a Protestant champion.  Tensions continued in the following decades, during which France protected Jacobites who sought to overthrow the later Stuarts and, after 1715, the Hanoverians.Claydon, "William III"
After William III, the opposition of France and Britain shifted from religion to economy and trade: the two nations vied for colonial domination in the Americas and Asia. The "The Seven Years' War" was one of the greatest and most decisive conflicts. France's alliance and backing of the Thirteen Colonies' revolt against Britain was successful in undermining British colonial hegemony in North America, but in turn debts from that conflict sowed the economic seeds of France's own revolution shortly thereafter.
The military rivalry continued with British opposition of the French Revolution and the ensuing wars with first the new French Republic and then the First French Empire of Napoleon.  His defeat in 1813 at the "Battle of Leipzig", followed in 1815 by "The Hundred Days" and the second defeat at the "Battle of Waterloo", effectively ended the recurrent war between France and Britain. However, the Coalition goal of restoring the French Bourbon monarchy in the Treaty of Paris and the subsequent Congress of Vienna and preventing further revolutions in Europe"British and Foreign State Papers", p.281 ultimately failed with the later events of The European Revolutions of 1848. 
The recurrent rhetoric used in each country shifted from references to a "natural enemy" to an agreement to tolerate one another. Common interests led the two to cooperate in the "Crimean War" of the 1850's.  A century after fighting one another (and with the mutual interest in checking the growing power of a united Germany with its Empire), the two were able to establish the "Entente Cordiale" by 1904, demonstrating that the "First" and "Second" Hundred Years' Wars were in the past; cultural differences continued, but violent conflict was over.

Douglas Harry Bosco (born July 28, 1946) is a former U.S. Representative from California.
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Bosco attended Homestead High School, Sunnyvale, California. He graduated from the Capitol Page School in Washington, D.C., 1963. He received a B.A. from Willamette University in 1968 and a J.D. from Willamette Law in 1971. He was admitted to the California bar in 1971, and commenced practice in San Rafael. He served as director of the California Department of Human Relations in 1973. He became executive director of the Marin County Housing Authority in 1974.
Bosco was elected to the California State Assembly, and served from 1978 to 1982. He served as a delegate to the California State Democratic convention in 1982. He served as a delegate to the 1980 Democratic National Convention.
In 1982, Bosco won the Democratic nomination for [tpl]ushr|California|1[/tpl], which had been renumbered from the 2nd District after redistricting.  In a major upset, he defeated 20-year incumbent Don Clausen by just over two points.  He went on to serve four terms in the House, but lost by only 1.5 points in 1990 to Republican Frank Riggs. He was once a resident of Occidental, California, and currently resides in Santa Rosa, California.
He attempted a comeback to his Congressional seat in 1994, by challenging Democratic incumbent Dan Hamburg, but lost the primary, in part due to the House banking scandal. Hamburg went on to lose the general election to Frank Riggs.

"Management of fungal diseases in tropical fruits." Proceedings of the IPGRI-ICAR-UTFANET Regional Training course on the Conservation and Use of Germplasm of Tropical Fruits in Asia at the Indian Institute of Horticultural Res (1997): 18-31 O. mangiferae is found in all areas where mangoes have been raised long term, but is particularly widespread in India where both the host and the pathogen are native. Currently no teleomorph stage has been identified, but due to certain morphological characteristics it has been suggested that O. mangiferae belongs in the Erysiphe polygony group. Mango is the only known host for this pathogen, though O. mangiferae appears to be identical to fungi responsible for powdery mildew diseases on various other plant species, particularly oak, though some differences may be observed. In particular, the number of cells in conidiophores varies from 2 on mango to 3-5 on oak. O. mangiferae has been known to infect oak leaves in the laboratory, however due to the lack of a known telemorph stage O. mangiferae is still considered to only be a pathogen of mango.Akhtar, Khalid P., and S. S. Alam. "Powdery Mildew of Mango: A Review." Pakistan Journal of Biological Sciences 3 7(2000): 1119-1122. Recent analysis of its ribosomal DNA suggests it is conspecific with Erysiphe alphitoides, the causative agent of powdery mildew in European oaks.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1439-0329.2008.00544.x[/tpl]

Exobasidium vexans
Blister blight caused by Exobasidium vexans is a devastating leaf disease in tea
(Camellia sinensis) in almost all tea growing regions in Asia. This disease causes
serious crop losses under inclement weather conditions besides affecting quality of
made tea. Although tea cultivars show varying degrees of resistance/susceptibility to
blister blight, a cultivar showing total resistance to blister blight has not yet been
identified.http://repository.rjt.ac.lk/jspui/bitstream/7013/791/1/Molecular.pdf
The mature two-celled basidiospores are very easily dislodged from the sterigmata and are usually to be found on the surface of the blister. In carefully collected material we have seen the mature two-celled basidiospores attached to sterigmata.
Although the basidiospore is normally one-septate, as many as three septa have been seen in germinated spores. The view is expressed that the extra septa are normally formed during germination.http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007153648800045

Laricifomes officinalis is a wood-decay fungus in the order Polyporales.  It causes brown heart rot on conifers, and is found in Europe, Asia, and North America, as well as Morocco.  It is commonly known as agarikon, as well as the quinine conk due to its extremely bitter taste.  DNA analysis supports L. officinalis as being distinct from the genus Fomitopsis.  
The conks were once collected extensively for production of medicinal quinine, which they were thought to contain, because of the bitter taste of the powdered conk. However, they do not contain quinine, and have no anti-malarial properties.Arora, David. Mushrooms Demystified. Ten speed Press: 1986. p. 580.
The decay is common only in a few old-growth stands. The distinctive conks can be large, as much as two feet long, hoof-shaped or columnar. They are soft, yellow-white when young, soon becoming white and chalky throughout. The decay is brown, cubically cracked, with thick white felts in large cracks. The taste of both conks and felts is bitter and distinct for this species. A single conk usually indicates complete cull. Infected trees can be habitat for snag-nesting species.Hagle, Gibson, Tunnock. A Field Guide to Diseases & Insect Pests of Northern & Central Rocky Mountain Conifers.

Mariella Devia (12 April 1948) is an Italian operatic soprano, well known for performing many roles in the bel canto repertoire.
Born in Chiusavecchia, Devia trained at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome with Iolanda Magnoni. She made her stage debut in Treviso in the title role of Lucia di Lammermoor in 1973 and quickly sang throughout Italy, making her debut at La Scala in Milan in 1987, as Giulietta in ''I Capuleti e i Montecchi.
On the international scene, she appeared at the Metropolitan Opera from 1979 to 1994 as Lucia, Gilda and Constanze, and at Carnegie Hall as Lakmé, in 1979. She made her debut at the Paris Opera and the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1987, and at the Royal Opera House in London in 1988.
She was a regular at the Pesaro Festival and at the Festival della Valle d'Itria in Martina Franca, where she won great acclaim in the resurrection of long neglected operas by Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini and other bel canto composers. She is also admired in Mozart operas, especially as Constanze in Die Entführung aus dem Serail, as well as Verdi's Gilda and Violetta. In 2013, the day after her 65th birthday, she performed for the first time, with great success, the role of Norma at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna.Jack Buckley, "Mariella Devia's Norma", Seen and Heard International, 16 April 2013 Gabriele Cesaretti, [tpl]it[/tpl] "Bologna – Teatro Comunale: Norma", OperaClick, undated

[[Kretzschmaria deusta]]
CATEGORIES: Plant pathogens and diseases, Xylariales

Kretzschmaria deusta, commonly known as brittle cinder, is a fungus and plant pathogen found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.  It is common on a wide range of broadleaved trees including beech (Fagus), oak (Quercus), lime (Tilia), and maple (Acer).  It causes a soft rot, breaking down both cellulose and lignin, and decays the trunk and/or roots of living trees.  The fungus continues to decay wood after the host tree has died, making K. deusta a facultative parasite. The resulting brittle fracture has a ceramic-like fracture surface.  Black zone lines can be seen in cross-sections of wood infected with K. deusta.
New fruiting bodies are formed in the spring and are flat and gray with white edges.  The fruiting bodies persist all year and their appearance changes to resemble asphalt, consisting of black, domed, lumpy crusts.  The mature fruiting bodies are brittle like charcoal and are usually found between the root buttresses.

The 1956-57 British Home Championship was the final full championship before the Munich air disaster would kill senior members of all four squads mid-way through the following tournament. A close-fought competition between England and Scotland, the tournament also featured some very good performances from Wales and Northern Ireland. For tournaments of the day, this was considered a low scoring affair, although the performances were consistently high.
England won the championship in a close final match, but after the first round and tea could have taken the trophy, Ireland holding England to a draw and the Scots doing likewise with the Welsh. In the second games, Wales were well beaten by England, but Scotland were forced to struggle to a 1–0 win over Ireland. In the final matches, any team could still have taken the trophy, but Wales and Ireland outplayed each other in their match and as a result drew 0–0, leaving the final game to be the decider between the English and the Scots. England triumphed eventually in a tough 2–1 win.

A split in phylogenetics is a bipartition of a set of taxa, and the smallest unit of information in unrooted phylogenetic trees: each edge of an unrooted phylogenetic tree represents one split, and the tree can be efficiently reconstructed from its set of splits. Moreover, when given several trees, the splits occurring in more than half of these trees give rise to a consensus tree, and the splits occurring in a smaller fraction of the trees generally give rise to a consensus Split Network.

[[Timothy Turner]]
CATEGORIES: 1585 births, 1677 deaths, Knights Bachelor, Members of Gray's Inn, Serjeants-at-law

Sir Timothy Turner SL JP (11 July 1585 – January 1677) was an English judge.
Turner was the eldest son of the Shropshire barrister Thomas Turner. He was a member of Staple Inn and then joined Gray's Inn on 8 March 1607, being called to the bar on 30 October 1611. In the contemporary debates between Sir Edward Coke and Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, Turner's notebooks reveal him to have felt a strong reaction against Ellesmere's claims for the royal prerogative as "transcendent to the common law".
His initial practice was centered around Ludlow, the legal center of Wales and the Marches, but he was of little note officially until 1626, when he became a justice of the peace for Shropshire, through the influence either of Sir Thomas Coventry, or Ellesmere's son and heir the Earl of Bridgewater. (Turner's second wife was the widow of Bridgewater's late solicitor.)
A commissioner in Shropshire for the forced loan of 1626, Turner was subsequently king's solicitor before the Council of the Marches from 1627 to 1637, and a master in chancery extraordinary from 1630. He became a bencher of Gray's Inn in 1632. His first judicial appointment came in 1634, when he was made puisne judge for the North Wales circuit, and in 1637, became chief justice of South Wales. He became recorder of Shrewsbury in 1638.
In 1642, it was reported to the House of Commons that Turner and the mayor of Shrewsbury had placed a declaration before the grand jury which declared the Commissions of Array legitimate and included a promise to defend the King as well as the laws and privileges of Parliament. While Turner later claimed that he had been forced to take this position due to the strength of the Royalist party in Shropshire — and several members of his household, including his son, joined the Parliamentary cause — he was stripped of his offices by the end of 1645 and forced to compound with Parliament.
During the Interregnum, Turner reflected in 1658 that the conflict between Coke and Ellesmere  "overthrew all at Last and brought the whole nation...into that slavery". However, upon the Restoration, Turner's passivity during the Interregnum was rewarded. He was made Chief Justice of Chester in 1660, restored to the recordership of Shrewsbury from 1660 until 1670, and a serjeant-at-law in 1669. He was knighted in 1670, and died in January 1677.

It rises to 650 ft (198 m), and is owned and managed by Gloucester City Council's Countryside Unit. The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust also has its head office based here.
It was originally one of the main sources of water to the city.Augustine Henry, "Forests Woods and Trees in Relation to Hygiene", Constable, 1852, p.220  The springs rising on Robin's Wood Hill were used by Gloucester Abbey in the 13th century.Gloucester: Public services, "A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 4: The City of Gloucester" (1988), pp. 262-269. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42308 Date accessed: 15 May 2009  Reservoirs were built by the Gloucester Water Company in 1837-8 and taken over by the City in 1855.  Robinswood Hill ceased to provide water supply in 1924 but the reservoirs remained in use for storage until 1946; they have now been backfilled to provide carparks and a countryside centre for the thousands of visitors that use the hill for recreation and inspiration.
It is home to much wildlife and affords spectacular views of the surrounding area including other hills of Gloucester, the Cotswolds, Malvern Hills, May Hill and on a clear day the Severn Bridges.
The country park itself is a [tpl]convert|100|ha|adj=on[/tpl] site. On the other side of the Hill is a dry ski slope and golf course complex.

John Davison Hewie (born 12 December 1928) is a former Scottish international footballer who spent most of his career with Charlton Athletic.
Hewie was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Scottish ex-pat parents and lived there for the first 21 years of his life. He developed a keen interest in sport while at school, notably tennis and hockey .  Football however was his primary pastime and he honed his skills first with his employer's works team then local sides Arcadia and Johannesburg.
In October 1949 the opportunity arose for Hewie to turn professional with English side Charlton Athletic, who had already imported several other South African-based players. He would spend the next 19 years in south-east London, making over 500 appearances[tpl]cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=573362006| publisher = The Scotsman | title = Hewie swapped the High Veldt for Hampden | date=2006-04-15[/tpl] for the Addicks and playing in almost every position, including four times as a goalkeeper, when regular custodian Mick Rose was injured.
In 1956 he made his debut for the Scottish national side, playing in a 1-1 draw against England at Hampden Park. His first appearance in a Scotland shirt occurred three years earlier when he was selected for a Scotland B game in Edinburgh. Remarkably, this was the first occasion Hewie had set foot in Scotland. He made a total of 19 appearances for Scotland, predominantly at fullback, during which he scored twice. He was selected in the squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup and missed a penalty in the 2-1 defeat by France.
Hewie briefly moved into a managerial role as his playing career ended, when he undertook the role of player-manager for non-league Kent side Bexley United.[tpl]cite book | last = Lamming | first = Douglas | title = A Scottish Soccer Internationalists Who’s Who, 1872-1986 | publisher = Hutton Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-907033-47-4 [/tpl] He returned to South Africa and first club Arcadia in 1968 and remained in the country of his birth until the early 1990s, at which point he returned to the United Kingdom. He currently lives in Spalding, Lincolnshire and still attends Charlton Athletic matches when the opportunity allows.

The 1901-02 British Home Championship was an international football tournament between the British Home Nations which was meant to herald the arrival full professional game of football as both England and Scotland fielded fully professional teams for the first time. The championship was however dominated and overshadowed by a disaster during the final deciding match between England and Scotland at Ibrox Park, which claimed 25 lives.Ibrox Park and the greatest loss of all, scotsman.com Heritage & Culture, Retrieved 1 June 2007 Six minutes into the game, a section of the wooden West Tribune Stand suddenly collapsed due to heavy rainfall the night before.The Fatalities of the Ibrox Disaster of 1902, Robert Shields, The Sports Historian 1998, Retrieved on 1 June 2007 Over 500 people were injured as the stadium was packed to its 68,000 capacity for the match. Although play was stopped in the immediate aftermath of the disaster as players, police and stewards rushed to aid the injured, it was later continued. The continued match finished 1–1 despite the players' reluctance and repeated pauses to allow police and injured spectators to cross the pitch. After the match the Scottish and English Football Associations decided to void the result, and the match was replayed at Villa Park.The Scotland Match at Ibrox Park in 1902, England Football Online, Peter Young, Retrieved 1 June 2007 All proceeds from the replay were contributed to the Disaster Fund set up to aid victims of the accident.1902 Newspaper Report, Scotland: The complete record 1872 to 2005, Retrieved 1 June 2007
Ireland kicked off the tournament in fine style, beating Wales 3–0 in Cardiff with a good performance. Their luck didn't hold out in their second game however, thumped 5–1 by an impressive Scottish side in Greenock. Scotland continued their run of good form against Wales, with another 5–1 victory, setting them up as tournament favourites going into the final games. England had played poorly in their opening matches, drawing 0–0 with Wales and scrambling a 1–0 victory over the Irish. The final match up was marred by tragedy and the game was eventually relocated to England due to the turmoil in the Scottish football community as a result of the disaster. The match was fiercely fought and ended with a 2–2 draw, sharing the points but giving the trophy to the Scots.

[[Anti-Judaism in early Christianity]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity and Judaism, Christianity and antisemitism, Christianity-related controversies

Antisemitism in Early Christianity is a description of anti-Jewish sentiment in the first three centuries of Christianity; Christianity in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries. "Early Christianity" is generally considered as Christianity before 325 when the First Council of Nicaea was convoked by Constantine the Great.
Jewish Christians were excluded from the synagogue, according to one theory of the Council of Jamnia, and as they refused to pay the Fiscus Judaicus.Historians debate whether or not the Roman government distinguished between Christians and Jews prior to Nerva's modification of the Fiscus Judaicus in 96. From then on, practising Jews paid the tax, Christians did not.

William Nicholls wrote in his book Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate:
Rabbi Michael J. Cook believes that both contemporary Jews and contemporary Christians need to reexamine the history of early Christianity, and the transformation of Christianity from a Jewish sect consisting of followers of a Jewish Jesus, to a separate religion often dependent on the tolerance of Rome while proselytizing among Gentiles loyal to the Roman empire, to understand how the story of Jesus came to be recast in an anti-Jewish form as the Gospels took their final form.Michael Cook 2008 Modern Jews Engage the New Testament
The Greek word Ioudaioi could also be translated "Judaeans", meaning in some cases specifically the Jews from Judaea, as opposed to people from Galilee or Samaria for instance.The Complete Gospels, Robert J. Miller editor, pages 193–194, cameo essay on "The Judeans", for example the translation of John 1:7: "After this, Jesus moved around in Galilee, he decided not to go into Judea, because the Judeans were looking for a chance to kill him."

The Church and Hospital of Jesús Nazareno are supposedly located at the spot where Hernán Cortés and Moctezuma II met for the first time in 1519, which was then the beginning of the causeway leading to Iztapalapa. Cortés ordered the hospital built to tend to soldiers wounded fighting with the Aztecs.[tpl]cite book |title=Moon Handbooks Mexico City |last= Humphrey |first=Chris |year=2005 |publisher=Avalon Travel Publishing  |location=Emeryville CA |isbn=9781566916127|page=41[/tpl]
According to the last will of Cortés, however, the hospital seems to have been meant primarily for the Indians.[tpl]clarify|date=January 2014[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The Jesús Hospital is one of the oldest buildings in Mexico City. It was most likely operating by 1524, although this is disputed, since it was one of three hospitals started around the same time, and various records have different dates for the first opening.[tpl]cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last= Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |coauthors=Magdalena Galindo  |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=218–220 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Hospital de Jesús Nazareno |first=Guillermo |last=Olvera Arce  |url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=5693&tabla=nuestromundo |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2000-05-13 |accessdate=2009-10-16 |language=Spanish [/tpl] The hospital with its church was originally called Purísima Concepción. At the beginning of the colonial period, it was popularly known as the Hospital del Marqués.[tpl]cite web |title=Hospital de Jesús |url=http://www.hospitaldejesus.com.mx/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26 |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-10-16 [/tpl]
The hospital was designed by Pedro Vázques and Cortés left a number of farmlands in his will for the benefit of the institution. Cortés died before the hospital  building was finished, and the colonial government hired Alonso Pérez de Castañeda. Six years and 43,000 pesos later, it was still not finished. 130 years later Antonio de Calderón Benavides was named head of the institution and worked to finish it. At this time the hospital received an image of Jesus of Nazarene, and the hospital was renamed after the image when it was finally dedicated in 1665. To one extent or another, just about all of New Spain’s major architects had a hand on this build from construction to repair work. Some on the list include Claudio de Arciniega, Diego de Aguilera, Sebastian Zamorano, Pedro de Arrieta and Francisco Antonio Guerrero y Torres.
In 1646, the hospital was the site of the first autopsies performed on the American continent, performed to teach anatomy to medical students of the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. In 1715, the hospital published the Regia Academia Mariana Practica Medica to promote more professional practices in the field of medicine in New Spain. The building today continues to function as a hospital.

The Hamlet consists of several small cross roads on minor country roads which are mostly without street lighting or pavement and some are single track for a length and lined with trees. There are many detached houses with fairly large gardens, scattered with trees, a public house and a small church; further out there are several farms with many fields, and larger, denser woodland.
Well Hill is sometimes referred to as a village but usually a hamlet; although not an absolute definition, it does not have its own parish at present. Well Hill along with Crockenhill to the north make the electoral ward Crockenhill and Well Hill Ward; however the settlement is within the Shoreham Parish not Crockenhill Parish.

[[Cherokee purple]]
CATEGORIES: Cherokee tribe, Heirloom tomato cultivars

Cherokee purple is the name of a cultivar of tomato, unusual for the deep purple/red hue of its fruit. It was one of the first of the "black" color group of tomatoes. It is also unusual in being extremely popular for the sake of its flavor, instead of only its unusual color. Cherokee Purple tomatoes are beefsteak in style, with green "shoulders" across the top.  They are also notable for having a dense, juicy texture, with small seed locules irregularly scattered throughout the flesh.  The comparatively dark interior color is enhanced by the tendency of the seeds to be surrounded by green gel.  
This cultivar originated with Craig LeHoullier, who claimed it was a century-old cultivar originating with the Cherokee people.  In 1990, while living in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Craig received unsolicited in the mail, from John Green of Sevierville, Tennessee, a brief note and a small packet of seeds.  The note indicated that John wanted to share this unnamed tomato with Craig, and that it was a purple tomato that the Cherokee Indians gave to his neighbors 100 years ago.  Upon growing the seeds and observing the fruit, Craig was surprised and delighted to find that the fruit was remarkably close to being a true purple in color (pink tomatoes were often referred to as purple in horticultural literature, so the color of the tomato was quite a surprise).  The tomato was named in line with the note that accompanied the seeds, and a sample of seeds were sent that winter to Jeff McCormack, founder of Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, as well as listed in the Seed Savers Exchange (SSE) Yearbook 1991 edition.  A few years later, Craig also sent it to Rob Johnston, founder of Johnny's Selected Seeds.  Both seed companies elected to multiply the seed and carry the variety in their seed catalogs.  Craig sent out many seed samples to SSE members over the next few years.  Through these transactions, as well as the availability via the two seed companies, Cherokee Purple has become a very popular, widely grown and well regarded variety.  Craig now lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Cherokee Purple remains one of his favorite varieties in a tomato collection that numbers well over 1500 varieties.

Johannes Orth (January 14, 1847 - January 13, 1923) was a German pathologist born in Wallmerod. 
He studied medicine at the University of Bonn, earning his doctorate in 1872. Afterwards he served as an assistant to Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) in Berlin. In 1878 he became a professor at the University of Göttingen, and in 1902, following the death of Virchow, he returned to Berlin as director of the clinic of pathology. 
Orth specialized in the pathological study of infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis and endocarditis. In 1875 he documented an account involving an autopsy of a jaundiced infant with intense yellow staining of the basal ganglia, hippocampus, the third ventricle, as well as parts of the cerebellum. However, it wouldn't be until the early 20th century that this condition would be further comprehended. In 1903, pathologist Christian Georg Schmorl (1861-1932) presented the results of 120 autopsies of jaundiced infants, with six of the cases having the staining phenomena described by Orth. Schmorl coined the term "kernicterus" (jaundice of the basal ganglia) for the yellow staining phenomenon.

Sir Geoffrey Palmer, 1st Baronet, SL (1598 – 5 May 1670) was an English lawyer and politician.
Born in East Carlton, Northamptonshire, he obtained a BA from Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1616 and a MA 1619.[tpl]acad|id=PLMR612G|name=Palmer, Geoffrey[/tpl] He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 14 June 1616 and called to the bar on 23 May 1623. He married Margaret Moore, daughter of Francis Moore, a serjeant-at-law of Berkshire, by whom he had six children:
Palmer was elected to the Long Parliament in 1640, representing Stamford. He was a manager of Strafford's impeachment, giving advice on points of law and the procedural rights of the accused. He joined in the protestation of 3 May 1641 in defence of the Protestant religion, and the act for prolongation of the Parliament on 11 May 1641. After the latter, he joined Hyde and Falkland in supporting the King in his opposition to his new council. Upon the passage of the Grand Remonstrance, he rose to protest John Hampden's motion to print it, creating a tremendous tumult. The next day, he referred to the majority as "A Rabble of inconsiderable persons, set on by a juggling Junto," and was committed to the Tower for a few weeks. After the passage of the Militia Ordinance, he withdrew from Parliament to become Commissioner of Array for Lincolnshire.
In 1643, he was awarded a DCL by Oxford University, and was a member of the royalist Parliament that met there in 1644. Appointed Solicitor General in 1645, he was captured at the fall of Oxford and compounded his estates for £500 in September 1648. He practiced law in London during the 1650s. Palmer was committed to the Tower again on 9 June 1655 on suspicion of raising forces against Cromwell, but was released the following year.
Palmer prospered at the Restoration, being made Attorney General on 31 May 1660, and bencher of the Middle Temple the next month. He was knighted on 1 June 1660, created a baronet on 7 June 1660, and serjeant-at-law in October 1660.
During this period, he was active as counsel to the crown and in prosecutions, particularly that of the regicides in 1662. A strong supporter of the royal prerogative, he joined with Hyde, now Earl of Clarendon, who was assembling a collaboration to enact legislation. Geoffrey obtained a seat at Ludgershall for his elder son, Geoffrey, in March 1661 by forcing the sheriff to deliver the election writ to his agent, but Geoffrey died in October; his son Lewis was elected for Higham Ferrers at the same election. He briefly enjoyed an appointment as Chief Justice of Chester from 1661 to 1662, and was recorder of Boston from 1662 until his death on 5 May 1650, in his house at Hampstead Fields, Middlesex. His funeral was attended by a large number of nobles and judges, and he was interred at Carlton.
His estates included the manors of East and West Carlton, Northamptonshire, which his family had held from the 15th century and the neighbouring estate at Carlton Curlieu Hall, Leicestershire, which he purchased in 1664.Palmer Manuscripts, National Archives: Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutland Record Office Ref No. DE1110

CATEGORIES: English feminine given names, Hebrew feminine given names, Feminine given names, English given names invented by fiction writers, Given names

Jessica (also Jesica, Jessicah or Jessikahttp://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Jesica) is a female given name.
The oldest written record of the name with its current spelling is found as the name of a character in Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, where it belongs to the daughter of Shylock. The name may have been an Anglicisation of the Biblical Iskah  (from the Hebrew: יִסְכָּה : yiskāh), the name of a daughter of Haran briefly mentioned in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. Iskah was rendered "Jeska" in English Bibles available in Shakespeare's day.Hanks, P. & Hodges, F. A Dictionary of First Names. (1990). Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-211651-7.
The original Hebrew name Yiskāh (יִסְכָּה), means "foresight", or being able to see the potential in the future. The Hebrew root sakhah (ס.כ.ה) means "to see," so the name Yiskah, with the added future-tense yod, implies foresight or clairvoyance.  Yiskah is the niece of Abraham.

CATEGORIES: 1710 births, 1780 deaths, Roman Catholic theologians, Italian theologians, Italian archaeologists

Casto Innocenzio Ansaldi (March 7, 1710, Piacenza, Italy—1780, Turin) was an Italian professor, theologian and archaeologist.
In 1726 Ansaldi entered the Dominican Order at Parma, where he pursued his preparatory studies. In 1733 he was a student of the College of St. Thomas in Rome, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum where he attached himself to Giuseppe Agostino Cardinal Orsi. In 1735 he taught philosophy at Santa Caterina in Naples, and the following year received the chair of metaphysics at the University of Naples. However in 1737 he was forced to resign after receiving orders from his superiors to move to Bologna. He seems to have disobeyed the order and gone into hiding for some time to avoid the consequences. The King of Naples created a chair of theology for him in 1737, which he retained until 1745. In that year he was appointed first teacher of theology at the Dominican convent in Brescia. Thereafter, to 1770, he taught at Ferrara and then and Turin. In the latter city he held the chair in theology for twenty years with great success and repute. He was averse to the scholastic method and therefore had serious trouble with the authorities of the Order, which was finally smoothed over by Angelo Maria Cardinal Quirini and Pope Benedict XIV.
His published works fill several volumes, and have been prized for a combination of theological and historical erudition. Most of them are directed against the anti-Christian tendencies of his day. His most important works are:
His controversy with Francesco Zanotti in defense of Maupertuis's apology (Berlin, 1749) for Christian morality, as superior to that of the Stoics, was celebrated in the eighteenth century. He also compiled Della necessità e verità della religione naturale e rivelata (Venice, 1755), a collection of evidences and admissions from the works of celebrated non-Catholics. His brother, also a Dominican, Carlo Agostino Ansaldi, wrote a work (Turin, 1765) on the large number of the Christians before Constantine I; another brother, Pietro Tommasso Ansaldi, wrote a dissertation on the divinity of Christ (Florence, 1754).

After the collapse of the Saiō system, Saikū reverted to a rice-farming village that currently exists as a part of Meiwa Town, Mie Prefecture.

Raetihi Forest fire was a fire that occurred on the 19–20 March 1918 in and around the townships of Raetihi and Ohakune on the North Island of New Zealand.
The great fire itself was a major catastophe. It burned for two days devastating areas of forest and almost destroying the townships of Raetihi and Ohakune. Along with the great stands of Rimu and other large stands of podocarps in the North Island Volcanic Plateau of New Zealand. 150 houses and nine sawmills were lost. Three people died as a result of the fire when their farmhouse was burned. There were reports that schools 100 kilometres away were closed and that the skies were darkened with the amount of smoke in the air.[tpl]Fact|date=October 2007[/tpl]
It was generally thought but never confirmed that the forest was set alight by coals dropped from a railway engine from the newly developed North Island Main Trunk Railway.

Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
Is't not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;
Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed.
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail.

WKKP Classic Country 1410 broadcasts on 1410 kHz at a power of 2,500 watts daytime and 58 watts at night from a tower located on Racetrack Road in McDonough, Georgia, a southern suburb of Atlanta. The station is owned by Henry County Radio Co Inc. and originates from studios located on Brownlee Road in Jackson, Georgia. The station was originally WZAL and was assigned to 1540 kHz and was owned by Dallas Tarkenton (older brother of Fran Tarkenton), broadcasting until it was purchased by DeVan-Moore Communication, Inc. in 1980. The station saw successful growth in the hands of Jim DeVan (former manager of WMCD, Statesboro, Georgia) and moved to 1410 kHz in the late 1980s.  Jim DeVan managed WZAL until his sudden death from a work-related accident in 1991.

[[Sõrve Peninsula]]

CATEGORIES: Baltic Sea, Saaremaa, Peninsulas of Estonia, Geography of Saare County

Sõrve Peninsula ([tpl]lang-et|Sõrve poolsaar[/tpl]) is a peninsula which forms the southernmost section of the Estonian island Saaremaa. Its length is 32 km, and its maximum width 10 km. South of it lies Irbe Strait, the main entrance to the Gulf of Riga of the Baltic Sea.
Administratively, it comprises Torgu Parish and Salme Parish, both in Saare County
Historically, the peninsula had considerable military significance, dominating the Irbe Strait and the sea route to Riga.  In the first half of the 20th century strong coastal batteries were installed on it by Imperial Russia up to 1917 and then by the Soviet Union after 1940.
In the course of World War II, the peninsula saw major fighting between Soviet and German forces, first in 1941 with the Germans attacking and the Soviets defending, and again during the Moonsund Landing Operation in 1944 with the roles reversed.
Even now it is dangerous to walk in undeveloped forest areas because a lot of unexploded ordnance remains from the fighting.
The Sõrve peninsula is also known for its unique and special natural attractions. Many rare species of birds, flowers and insects can be found throughout Sõrve.
About 400 people live there throughout the year, but most of the people are retired. Before the war, Sõrve was the most densely inhabited rural area in Estonia.
Since 1947, Estonian expatriate organisations in Australia run an annual youth summer camp called "Sõrve", named after Sõrve peninsula.

CATEGORIES: 1930 births, 1998 deaths, American male stage actors, American theatre directors, Drama Desk Award winners, People from Memphis, Tennessee, Tony Award winners, 20th-century American male actors

Ellis Rabb (June 20, 1930, Memphis, Tennessee – January 11, 1998, Memphis, Tennessee) was an American actor and director who in 1959 formed the Association of Producing Artists, a theatre company that brought new works and noteworthy revivals to Broadway and to regional theatres. The APA merged with the Phoenix Theatre in 1964 and as the APA-Phoenix went on to mount Broadway revivals of Man and Superman, The Show Off, Right You Are If You Think You Are, and Hamlet (in which Rabb played the title role) among others, with the APA-Phoenix receiving a special Tony Award for distinguished achievement prior to disbanding in 1969.
Rabb’s subsequent work as an actor included starring in the New York premiere of David Mamet's A Life in the Theatre in 1977 at Off-Broadway's Theatre de Lys and in 1980 he played the title role in The Man Who Came to Dinner at the Circle in the Square Theatre.
His later directing work included a 1973 production of A Streetcar Named Desire, starring Rosemary Harris (to whom he was married from 1959–1967), James Farentino, and Patricia Conolly; a memorable production of The Royal Family in 1975 for which he won both a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award, and a 1983 revival of You Can't Take It With You with Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst. His final Broadway production was his own adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's The Loves of Anatol.
Rabb appeared in Cheers playing an imaginary spy and then a poet in the episode "The Spy Who Came In For A Cold One".  He was unmasked as the former by Diane Chambers and as the latter by Coach. Former Cheers star Kelsey Grammer has stated that Rabb, whom Grammer had also worked with in the theater, was his main inspiration for the character Sideshow Bob on The Simpsons.[tpl]cite web|last=Allan|first=Marc|title=17 Reasons to Turn On the TV|url=http://www.nuvo.net/ScreensBlog/archives/2011/07/30/17-reasons-to-turn-on-the-tv|publisher=Nuvo Magazine|accessdate=3 August 2011[/tpl]

Altogether, Nannes has played for fourteen different franchises across seven different countries, including the Melbourne Renegades and Sydney Thunder in Big Bash League matches, and the Delhi Daredevils, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Chennai Super Kings in Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. As of February 2014, he had taken 222 wickets from 189 Twenty20 matches, ranking only behind Lasith Malinga, Alfonso Thomas, and Azhar Mahmood in terms of wickets taken in that format.

The Lee County Central Electric Railway, or LCC, was an electric interurban railway linking the small prairie town of Lee Center with nearby Amboy and Middlebury in northern Illinois.  The line was conceived as an electric railway link between the cities of Steward, south of Rochelle, and Dixon, but was never able to raise enough capital to reach either destination.  The LCC was one of the smallest and shortest-lived electric operations in the entire national interurban network, and yet despite its notorious operational problems it survived as a de-electrified freight carrier far longer than most larger interurban railways.

In a Sheffield Shield match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) against Tasmania in 2010–11, he scored a half century in the first innings and then 102 in the second innings.

Mbalabala (Balla Balla until 1982) is a village on the main Beitbridge-Bulawayo road (at the junction with the Filabusi Road) in Matabeleland, Zimbabwe. Situated approximately 41 miles (66 km) south-east of the city of Bulawayo. The name is derived from the Ndebele name for the greater kudu (scientific name: Tragelaphus strepsiceros). It was originally rendered Balla Balla by Europeans, which was altered to its present name in 1982 by the Zimbabwean government in order to coincide closer with the local pronunciation.
The village has a railway station on the Beitbridge Bulawayo Railway and is the railhead for the mining area of Filabusi. The village also hosts a large army barracks, which is the Zimbabwe School of Infantry, formerly Shaw Barracks for the Rhodesian African Rifles from 1976 to 1980. The site was previously St. Stephen's College from February 1959 to December 1975.
Mbalabala is situated on high ground, which forms a ridge between the Mzingwane and Mbilambowe watersheds, in an important cattle ranching area with a history of gold prospecting. There is a prominent landmark nearby in the form of a granite hill (kopje) known as Balloon Kop or "Baldy" - due to its bare rock.

James Robert "Bobby" Combe (29 January 1924 — 19 January 1991) was a Scottish footballer, who played for Hibernian and was player/manager of Dumbarton for one season. He also represented Scotland and the Scottish League XI.
A schoolboy internationalist,[tpl]cite book | last = Lamming | first = Douglas | title = A Scottish Soccer Internationalists Who’s Who, 1872-1986 | type = Hardback | publisher = Hutton Press | year = 1987 | id = (ISBN 0-907033-47-4) [/tpl] Combe joined his local club Hibernian at the age of 17 from Inveresk Athletic. He was originally an inside right but dropped back to the half back line upon the formation of the Hibs Famous Five forward line, his old position taken by Bobby Johnstone. Despite operating largely in the shadows of the "Five", Combe enjoyed a long and successful career. He won League winners medals in 1948, 1951 and 1952. He also won one Scottish League Cup runners-up medal.
Combe was also a Scotland internationalist, earning three caps in 1948. He made his debut in a 2–0 defeat by England and also appeared against Switzerland and Belgium that year, scoring against the latter. He was selected in Scotland's 22 man squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup but the Scottish Football Association only budgeted to take 13 players (including only one goalkeeper) to the finals in Switzerland. Combe was one of the nine who did not travel, along with the likes of Ernie Copland and Jimmy Binning. Inside forward George Hamilton was also on reserve, but travelled after Bobby Johnstone withdrew through injury.
Combe retired from playing in 1957 and was appointed Hibernian's trainer. He held that role for two years before briefly becoming player-manager of Dumbarton. In his later years, Combe worked as a shopkeeper in his native Leith, then in the marketing department of Scottish Gas.

[[100 Watt Smile]]
CATEGORIES: Grunge musical groups

100 Watt Smile was an eclectic grunge-styled band with country influences that was founded in 1994 by singer/songwriter Carrie Bradley (formerly of Ed's Redeeming Qualities and The Breeders) and drummer Michael Hart.  The band's lineup soon expanded to contain Matt Stahl on guitar and Brad Pedinoff on bass, who, after a couple of years, were replaced by Scotts Greiner and Houston on guitar and bass respectively.
The band provided a vehicle for the quirky songwriting that Bradley was known for during her days with Ed's Redeeming Qualities, with her quiet, breathy vocals and signature violin work juxtaposed against heavy electric guitar and bass and driving percussion.  Indeed, the 1999 debut album of the second lineup, And Reason Flew, begins with an updated version of Bradley's haunting song New Jersey, which first appeared on the Ed's Redeeming Qualities album Big Grapefruit Cleanup Job.
The band followed up with a second, eponymous album in 2001; after the release of this album, information about the subsequent activities of the band and its members is scarce, at best.  Carrie Bradley has recently been spotted as part of the San Francisco musical duo The Great Auk.

[[Lullaby for the Hearts of Space]]
CATEGORIES: 1980 albums, New Age albums by American artists, Ambient albums by American artists

Lullaby for the Hearts of Space (1980) is an album by the American ambient musician Kevin Braheny.
Both pieces on the album were performed live using the Mighty Serge modular analog synthesizer and were spontaneous, improvised compositions. The first track, "Lullaby for the Hearts of Space", was originally recorded for a Hearts of Space radio special at KPFA-FM in March, 1980. The second track, "After I Said Goodnight," took inspiration from Emilie Conrad-Da'Oud's work Continuum and was created live during one of her classes.
Unlike Braheny's other albums, Lullaby for the Hearts of Space was never released on compact disc, reportedly because Braheny was not fond of the results.  Braheny asked Hearts of Space to not release additional copies after the existing copies had sold out and the request was granted. As a result, the album is difficult to find. The recording is being remastered by Braheny Fortune, and has an indefinite re-release date.http://www.kevinbrahenyfortune.com/music/discography.html

François Lake is a lake located in British Columbia about 30 kilometers south of Burns Lake and 10 kilometers west of Fraser Lake. The lake is 110 kilometers long and is the second longest natural lake entirely within British Columbia after Babine Lake. Nadina River is the inflow of the lake at the west and Stellako River is the outflow of the lake. The lake is popularly fished for its Rainbow Trout and Char.
Because of its shape, the lake was called Nidabun, meaning "lip lake." The French-Canadians  mistook Nidaa for nedo, which meant "whiteman," and named it Lac des Français (meaning Lake of the French). The name Français later was altered to François.

[[Scanning capacitance microscopy]]

CATEGORIES: Scanning probe microscopy

Scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) is a variety of scanning probe microscopy in which a narrow probe electrode is held just above the surface of a sample and scanned across the sample. SCM characterizes the surface of the sample using information obtained from the change in electrostatic capacitance between the surface and the probe.
SCM was initially devised as a quality control tool for the RCA/CED (Capacitance Electronic Disc),[tpl]cite journal|last=Matey|first=JR|coauthors=J Blanc|title=Scanning Capacitance Microscopy|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|year=1985|volume=57|issue=5|pages=1437–1444|doi=10.1063/1.334506|bibcode = 1985JAP....57.1437M [/tpl] a video disk technology that was a predecessor of the DVD.  It has since been adapted for other systems and materials.
SCM uses an ultra-sharp conducting probe (often Pt/Ir or Co/Cr metal covering an etched silicon probe) to form a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS/MOS) capacitor with a semiconductor sample if a native oxide is present. When no oxide is present, a Schottky capacitor is formed. When the probe and surface are in contact, an AC bias is applied, generating capacitance variations in the sample which can be detected using a GHz resonant capacitance sensor. The tip is then scanned across the semiconductor's surface in 2D while the tip's height is controlled by conventional contact force feedback.
By applying an alternating bias to the metal-coated probe, carriers are alternately accumulated and depleted within the semiconductor’s surface layers, changing the tip-sample capacitance. The magnitude of this change in capacitance with the applied voltage gives information about the concentration of carriers (SCM amplitude data), whereas the difference in phase between the capacitance change and the applied, alternating bias carries information about the sign of the charge carriers (SCM phase data). Because SCM functions even through an insulating layer, a finite conductivity is not required to measure the electrical properties.

Johann Jakob Wepfer (December 23, 1620 – January 26, 1695) was a Swiss pathologist and pharmacologist who was a native of Schaffhausen. 
He studied medicine in Strasbourg, Basel and Padua, and in 1647 returned to Schaffhausen to practice medicine. Here he maintained a practice that extended into southern Germany. During his career he also served as a private physician and consultant to various members of royalty.
Wepfer is remembered for his work involving vascular anatomy of the brain, and the study of cerebrovascular disease. He was the first physician to hypothesize that the effects of a stroke were caused by bleeding in the brain. He also mentioned that these symptoms could be caused by a blockage of one of the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. From postmortem studies, he provided information on the carotid and vertebral arteries that supply the brain with blood. in 1658 he published a classic treatise on strokes, titled Historiae apoplecticorum.
Wepfer made important contributions in the fields of experimental pharmacology and toxicology. He conducted experiments on the toxicity of water hemlock, hellebore, monkshood,Essays in the history of therapeutics by William F. Bynum, et al and warned against the usage of arsenic, antimony, and mercury in medicine. In the fields of pharmacology/toxicology he published an influential work on water and poison hemlock called Cicutae aquaticae historia et noxae (1679).viaLibri Resources for Bibliophiles

[[Great Western, Victoria]]

CATEGORIES: Towns in Victoria (Australia), Wimmera

Great Western is a town in the east of the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia.  The town is located on the Western Highway, in the Shire of Northern Grampians local government area, 225 kilometres north west of the state capital, Melbourne.  The town has a population of 644.
The first European settlers in the Great Western area were sheep graziers in the 1840s and closer settlement began with the discovery of gold during the Victorian gold rush, the Post Office opening on 1 June 1858.[ref]
</ref>
.  The first vineyards in the Great Western area were established by two Frenchmen who met at the gold diggings at Daylesford.  Following their example, Joseph Best and his brother Henry established vineyards in 1865.  Following Joseph's death in 1888, the property was purchased by Hans Irvine.  Irvine imported staff from France and dedicated himself to establishing a sparkling wine of comparable quality of French champagne. In 1918, Irvine sold the winery to his friend and Australian wine pioneer, Benno Seppelt.
Today, Great Western is still producing quality sparkling wines including Seppelt Salinger at the Seppelt winery, now owned by Treasury Wine Estates. The Seppelt cellars include over 3 kilometres of labyrinthine tunnels ("drives") originally constructed by miners searching for gold and are now used to allow the sparkling wine to rest and develop. The other major vineyard in the area is the Concongella vineyard, operated by Best's Wines, producing a wide variety of wine types.   Table shiraz, including some from pre-phylloxera root stocks, is also produced by wineries in the area. The development of a water recycling program transferring waste water from nearby Ararat to wineries at Great Western has allowed recent expansion of the wine industry in the area.
The horse racing club, the Wimmera Racing Club, holds the Great Western Cup meeting on Australia Day (26 January),[ref]

[[Hand model]]
CATEGORIES: Modeling, Hand

A hand model is a person who models (poses or displays) their hand or hands for the purposes of art, fashion, products or advertising. Hand models are used in advertising where advertisers want close ups of the product being handled. Most hands have blemishes such as scrapes, scars, spots, or discolorations which would stand out in a close up and distract from the product. Hand models tend to have flawless skin and hands. In female hand models agents often seek long, slender hands and fingers and long nail beds. They also value smooth, hairless, unblemished skin with minimal wrinkles and visible pores.
Requirements for male hand models vary, depending on whether the job calls for a burly, construction worker type hand or a more white-collar look. For print media hand models, a necessary trait is the ability to pose in a relaxed, graceful fashion. Professional hand models avoid what photographers call "the claw," the rigid grip that novices often use before the camera. Hand models are prevalent in TV commercials, although the hand may not always be visible. Most food commercials have hand models pouring gravy, dipping a French fry or cutting meat. Here perfect hands are not as important as the timing and patience required to "hit one's mark." Some hand models can make upwards of $1,200 a day.CNN Article on Hand Models

Abū 'Amr Khalifa ibn Khayyat al Laythī al 'Usfurī (born : 160/161 A.H/777 A.D– died 239/240 A.H/ 854 A.D) was an Arab historian.
His family were natives of Basra in Iraq. His grandfather was a noted muhaddith or traditionalist, and Khalifa became renowned for this also. Among the great Islamic scholars who were his pupils were Bukhari and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.
He is known to have written at least four works, of which two have survived. These are the Tabaqat (biographies) and Tarikh (history). The latter is valuable as being one of three of the earliest Arabic histories, but the full text was not known until an 11th-century copy was found in Rabat, Morocco in 1966 (published in 1967).

Akhil Patel (born 18 June 1990) is an English cricketer who plays for Nottinghamshire. He is a left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm chinaman bowler. Patel was born in Nottingham. 
Patel made his debut first-class appearance for Derbyshire in April 2007 at the age of just 16, making a sturdy innings of 31 against Cambridge University UCCE, assisting the county's new Danish star Frederik Klokker on the latter's way to a century in just his second first-class appearance.
Patel also appeared in 2007 for Derbyshire's Second XI team, once again in partnership with Klokker. Patel is an often-reliable force with the bat, his only weakness so far being shown in a Second XI game against Nottinghamshire where, surrounded by some weaker team-mates, seven of whom failed to make double-figures, Patel was caught while in the middle of an initially healthy-looking partnership with team-mate Nicholas Ferraby.
In 2009 he joined his brother, Samit, six years his senior, at Nottinghamshire. He made a handful of games for the Outlaws before being released at the end of 2011 season. He also played Nottinghamshire Cricket Board Premier League for his home club Kimberley Institute Cricket Club.

He was ordained in Rome on October 28, 1928.

Goudie was a glam rock band from Austin, Texas fronted by Johnny Goudie.
Goudie started in 1996 as a solo project of frontman Johnny Goudie.  In 1997 Johnny's friend Einar Pedersen (who was also a member of Jez Spencer with Johnny Goudie) joined on bass and Bill Lefler replaced the original drummer Kyle Schneider, and Jimmy Messer was brought in as lead guitarist.
In the Spring of 1998, after only being together nine months, and still without a band name, the group played a showcase during the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.  Rather than playing a single showscase at a traditional venue, the band rented rehearsal space and played seven showcases throughout the day.  The strategy proved successful, and they caught the attention of Dan McCarroll, who was working with Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich to scout for bands to sign to a new record label Ulrich was forming as a subsidiary of Elektra Records.  After a second showcase in Los Angeles, California, Ulrich quickly signed the band, making Goudie the second band to be signed to the label (Canadian band DDT being the first). The band decided to simply call themselves Goudie and the label decided to call itself "The Music Company" or TMC.
In July 2000 Goudie released their debut album, Peep Show, to critical praise.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]  The band toured the country with such acts as Blur, Supergrass and Unified Theory, building what would become a large and loyal fan base.  The second single from the album, "Drag City", was featured on the compilation album ASCAP's EAR Volume 3.
In 2001 Bill Lefler left the band to pursue session work in Los Angeles.  The band took a short break from touring, but in April 2001 Nina Singh (formerly of The Borrowers) replaced Lefler and the band continued to tour and write new songs.
In June 2001 while recording their second album, Goudie, along with every other artist who hadn't sold a million records, was dropped from their recording contract with Elektra in the wake of corporate reshuffling following Elektra Records' parent company Time Warner's merger with AOL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2001-07-06/82279/|title=Goudie, Too, Shoos!|date=2001-07-06|author=Ken Lieck[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hitrockbottom.org/8stops7.html Interview with Evan from 8Stops7|title=Rock Bottom Interview: 8Stops7|date=2008-04-27|author=Tim Nydell|publisher=Rock Bottom[/tpl] Shortly thereafter, The Music Company label was dissolved.  The band played on, quickly signing with independent label India Records. In July, Jimmy Messer played his last show with Goudie, and Sean Mullens replaced him on lead guitar.
Goudie’s second album, Effects of Madness, was released March 5, 2002 and was extremely well received, garnering comparisons to Kiss, Bob Dylan, The Pretenders, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
After five years together, Goudie finally disbanded in the Spring of 2002.  Their music continues to be influential in the Austin music scene, and Johnny Goudie still performs many of the songs with his new band Johnny Goudie and the Little Champions.

Canfield Company in Chicago, the Crystal Soda Water Company of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Will G Keck Corporation's Laurel Springs Beverage division in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] In the late 1980's- earlier 1990's Cherikee Red brand was distributed by D & M Management, Inc. (Davidsville, PA), an independent beverage distribution firm, in the West Central Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, DC, and the Northern Virginia areas.  As of 2010, the brand is owned by the American Bottling Company of Plano, Texas, a subsidiary of Dr Pepper Snapple Group.[tpl]cite news |title= Pop Art - How 7 UP’s new ad campaign is trying to put the fizz back in the Uncola. |url=http://www.beverageworld.com/content/view/34000/  |work=Texas Monthly |publisher=Emmis Publishing LP |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080612031220/http://www.beverageworld.com/content/view/34000/ |archivedate = 2008-06-12[/tpl] http://www.texasmonthly.com/1999-01-01/business.php
Most commonly found in Ohio and Pennsylvania, the soda is rarely found outside of these two states. Despite not being as commercially successful as other popular cherry sodas, it has a popular nostalgic value within the distribution region of Cotton Club Bottling.
The beverage is bottled in 2 liter plastic bottles, 20oz bottles, and 12oz. cans. Each label features the head of an Indian chief. One can contains 190 calories entirely from 47 grams of sugar.
In 2010, Cherikee Red, in conjunction with R.C. Cola, had brand exclusivity in Pittsburgh's Consol Energy Center home of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

[[Polariton superfluid]]
CATEGORIES: Phases of matter

Polariton superfluid is predicted to be a state of the exciton-polariton system that combines the characteristics of lasers with those of excellent electrical conductors. Researchers look for this state in a solid state optical microcavity coupled with quantum well excitons. The idea is to create an ensemble of particles known as exciton-polaritons and trap them. Wave behavior in this state results in a light beam similar to that from a laser but possibly more energy efficient. 
Unlike traditional superfluids that need temperatures of approximately ~4 K, the polariton superfluid could in principle be stable at much higher temperatures, and might soon be demonstrable at room temperature.
Claims of the polariton superfluid appeared in the May 18, 2007, issue of the journal Science by David Snoke, an associate professor in the physics and astronomy department in the University of Pittsburgh School of Arts and Sciences. Snoke worked with University of Pittsburgh graduate students Ryan Balili and Vincent Hartwell on the project and their collaborators at the Bell Labs of Alcatel-Lucent in New Jersey.
Although several other researchers are working in the same field, the Pittsburgh group terminology and conclusions are not completely shared by them. In particular, important properties of superfluids, such as zero viscosity, and of lasers, such as perfect optical coherence, are a matter of debate.  Although, there is some indication of quantized vortices when the pump beam has orbital angular momentum.

[[History of Corsica]]

CATEGORIES: History of Corsica

That the history of Corsica has been influenced by its strategic position at the heart of the western Mediterranean and its maritime routes, only [tpl]convert|12|km|0[/tpl] from Sardinia, [tpl]convert|50|km|sigfig=1[/tpl] from the Isle of Elba, [tpl]convert|80|km[/tpl] from the coast of Tuscany and [tpl]convert|200|km[/tpl] from the French port of Nice, was first proposed by the 19th-century German theorist, Friedrich Ratzel. To him is often attributed the description "mountain in the sea". Regardless of whether he used that particular phraseThe reference is never given. Guy de Maupassant is alternatively proposed; however, the phrase has become in effect proverbial. the idea is expressed in his magnum opus, Anthropogeographie,[tpl]cite book|title=Anthropogeographie: Erster Teil|first=Friedrich|last=Ratzel|pages=page 62|year=1899|publisher=J. Engelhorn|location=Stuttgart[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]. which calls Corsica

and especially in his monograph on Corsica, La Corse, also published in 1899.[tpl]cite journal|first=Friedrich|last=Ratzel|title=La Corse, étude anthropogéographique|journal=Annales de Géographie|volume=8|issue=40|year=1899|pages=304–329|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/geo_0003-4010_1899_num_8_40_6121?_Prescripts_Search_isPortletOuvrage=false[/tpl] [tpl]fr icon[/tpl].
The Anthropogeographie presents an overall view of Ratzel's method of analysis but the 25-page monograph is perhaps the most relevant, applying the method in detail to Corsica. The "sea" part of the proverb refers to the easy accessibility by great powers to Corsica across the narrow waters from neighboring lands. Once they arrive the "mountain" provides a wall of defense against which invaders can make no easy headway. A central spine running north–south right along its length, which makes travel from (and communication between) one side to the other difficult, isolates Corsicans even from themselves. This spine and strategic position go some way to explaining the island's unique history.
At [tpl]convert|8778|km2[/tpl], it is the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean, after Sicily, Sardinia and Cyprus. Ratzel portrays a society never able either to be conquered or to rule itself but in the perpetual struggle for freedom and sovereignty producing "numberless champions". On this last point Ratzel admits to an unbridled admiration for his friend and associate Ferdinand Gregorovius, an advocate of Corsican culture, and joins him in portraying Pasquale Paoli and Napoleon Bonaparte, as larger than life.
In 1762, Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in his opus, The Social Contract, that Corsica would one day astonish Europe.Rousseau, J–J., The Social Contract, Chapter 10: "There is still in Europe one country capable of being given laws – Corsica. The valour and persistency with which that brave people has regained and defended its liberty well deserves that some wise man should teach it how to preserve what it has won. I have a feeling that some day that little island will astonish Europe." This was written some seven years before Napoleon was born.

[tpl]Redirect|Mutual Benefit||Mutual benefits (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Mutual aid[/tpl]

The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company was a life insurance company based in Newark, New Jersey that was chartered in 1845. The company was headed by Frederick Frelinghuysen (1848–1924).[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Frederick Frelinghuysen. Ex-President of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company Dies. |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B1EF73A59177A93C0A9178AD85F408285F9 |work= |publisher=New York Times |date=January 2, 1924|accessdate=2007-05-30 [/tpl]International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 3. St. James Press, 1991  The company was known as the "Tiffany" of insurance companies, a reference to its reputation as the life insurance company to the upper classes.
Mutual Benefit Life was taken into receivership for rehabilitation by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on July 16, 1991 after losses in an overheated real estate market led to a run by policyholders.  As with all life insurance carrier liabilities, the policy cash values and death benefits were taken over by stronger and larger carriers in the U.S. and all policyholders were kept whole.
The following was posted to the New Jersey commissioner's website: Inquiry to Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company
This will respond to inquiries regarding policies originally issued by The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company .
Mutual Benefit was placed in rehabilitation under the supervision of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on July 16, 1991. Mutual Benefit's in-force policies were transferred to MBL Life Assurance Corporation ("MBL Life"), effective May 1, 1994. Mutual Benefit was ultimately liquidated and dissolved, effective June 14, 2001.
Subsequent to 1994, all former Mutual Benefit policies were administered by MBL Life pursuant to a Plan of Rehabilitation approved by the Superior Court of New Jersey (the "Court"). In 1998, MBL Life entered into various transactions under which policy liabilities were transferred to other insurers. Each transaction was duly approved by the Court and filed with governing State Insurance Departments. Ultimately, an Order For Liquidation of MBL Life was entered, effective January 12, 2000. An Order For Dissolution was ordered by the court on October 22, 2004.
If the policy referenced in the inquiry was in force at the time of the applicable 1998 transaction, it was automatically transferred to one of the following insurers (depending on the type of policy):
Individual Life Insurance Contracts:
AIG SunAmerica Life Assurance Company (formerly, Anchor National Life
Insurance Company) (Non-New York State Policyholders)
First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company (New York State Policyholders)
c/o Liberty Insurance Services
Telephone: 800-821-7887
Individual Annuity Contracts:
AIG SunAmerica Life Assurance Company (formerly, Anchor National Life
Insurance Company) (Non-New York State Policyholders)
First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company (New York State Policyholders)
c/o AIG Annuity
Telephone: 888-333-2349
Group Annuity (Pension) Contracts:
c/o SunAmerica Financial Services
Telephone: 888-502-0600
Disability Insurance Contracts:
Reassure America Life Insurance Company (Non-New York State Policyholders)
Life Reassurance Corporation of America (New York State Policyholders)
c/o Insurance Servicing Center
Telephone: 800-743-0122
Please contact the applicable insurer for a response to the inquiry. (With regard to Group Annuity Contracts, participants inquiring about contracts issued under a pension plan may also seek additional information from either the Company personnel department or the Plan Administrator.)
If the policy or contract was not in force on the date of the applicable transaction, either (i) it had lapsed, (ii) it was surrendered for value, (iii) the proceeds had been previously distributed pursuant to the terms of the policy or (iv) the proceeds had been transferred to another insurer at the election of the contractholder. If any of these listed events occurred, the policy has terminated and there are no available records which will provide additional information.
In addition, a small number of active policies (e.g. Variable Annuity and 401(k) Contracts) were not transferred to the above-listed insurers and, pursuant to an Order entered by the Court, were either (i) terminated with the cash value paid to the contractholder or (ii) replaced by another insurer at the election of the policyowner. If the policy was thus terminated or replaced, there are no available records.
Finally, if the inquiry relates to a former group life or group health insurance policy, all such contracts were transferred to affiliates of the Fortis, Inc. Group in 1991. For further information, contact:

He came to British Columbia during the era of the Klondike Gold Rush and became a surveyor's assistant. Then, from 1908, he was a professional surveyor and surveyed many regions of British Columbia. He kept a journal of his work and collected over 5000 unique pictures of the era, which were donated to BC Archives for the benefit of future researchers. The photographs span a period of more than 40 years and cover many areas of the province. Their subjects include stagecoaches, sternwheelers, old forts and remote villages, mountains and rivers, pioneer settlers, miners and First Nations people.

The Association aims to explore and chart the extensive cave systems in Victoria (Australia) and elsewhere, represent the interests of Victorian cavers to the relevant authorities and to encourage the preservation of caves in their natural state.  There are over 800 caves in Victoria, many of them on private property.  In addition to its exploration, campaigning and conservation work the Association's members oversee recreational expeditions underground for the general public.
The VSA has been actively involved with the exploration of sinkholes and caves at Nullarbor Plain.  These have proved a rich source of megafauna fossils and the Association was instrumental in the discovery and recovery of a rare Thylacoleo skeleton in 2002.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ackma.org/journal/Presidents%20Message.pdf | title =  The megafauna discoveries in the Nullarbor are acknowledged by the Australasian Cave and Karst Management Association (ACKMA)[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.junemaclucas.com/why/why.htm | title = Well renowned cave artist takes part in the Nullarbor expedition[/tpl] The significance of such discoveries was great enough to warrant a special report on the ABC science show, Catalyst which aired on Australian television in 2006.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ackma.org/journal/64/EDITORIAL%20-%20Kent%20Henderson.pdf | title = Nullarbor megafauna discoveries are aired on Australian television[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s1717424.htm | title = Transcript of megafauna special report from ABC science show, Catalyst[/tpl]

Bay City Radio was a radio station in Hawke's Bay New Zealand. Bay City Radio commenced broadcasting on 1 October 1957 using the call-sign 2ZC and broadcasting on 1280 kHz AM, with the slogan Twin-City Radio, serving both Napier and Hastings. When Apple Radio commenced as a stand-alone station from the previously shared Hastings studio, the station was re-branded as Bay City Radio 2ZC. These stations were operated by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation which later became known as Radio New Zealand in 1975. In December 1981 a fire
started in one of the studios causing considerable damage. The whole top floor of the Dalgety building (Broadcasting House) was then completely refurbished and modernized with state-of-the-art equipment.  
In 1993 Bay City Radio joined the Classic Hits network and became known as Classic Hits Bay City Radio. In 1994, the station moved to 89.5FM and became Classic Hits 89FM Bay City Radio. Later the AM frequency would be used to broadcast Newstalk ZB into the Hawke's Bay region. Out of the times of 6-10am Monday to Saturday, the station is networked from Auckland.
The station is now on air as Classic Hits 89-5 and is still the most listened to local radio station. Local breakfast Monday to Friday is hosted by Martin Good and Sarah Van Der Kley. Annette Lunn reads local news. Neil Dunn hosts the Saturday breakfast show.

Zhu Rong or Zhurong ([tpl]zh|c=祝融|p=Zhù Róng[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-cmn|tʂu˥˩ʐʊ̃˧˥|[/tpl]), also known as Chongli ([tpl]zh|c=重黎|p=Chónglí[/tpl]), is an important personage in Chinese mythology and Chinese folk religion. According to the Huainanzi and the philosophical texts of Mozi and his followers, Zhurong is a god of fire and of the south. The Shanhaijing gives alternative genealogies for Zhurong, including descent from both the Yan Emperor and Yellow Emperor.Yang 2005:248 Some sources associate Zhurong with some of the principle early and ancient myths of China, such as those of Nuwa, Gong Gong and the Great Flood.Yang 2005:124 Chinese mythology has in the past been believed to be, at least in part, a factual recording of history. Thus, in the study of historical Chinese culture, many of the stories that have been told regarding characters and events which have been written or told of the distant past have a double tradition: one which tradition which presents a more historicised and one which presents a more mythological version.Yang 2005: 12-13 This is also true in the case of Zhurong. In Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian (Shi Ji), Zhurong is portrayed as a historical person, who held the governmental office of Minister of Fire.Hawkes 2011 1985: 81
Zhurong was said to be the son of Gaoyang (also known as Zhuanxu), a sky god.Hawkes 2011 1985: 21 and 79 (Again, the more historicised versions of the mythology portray Zhuanxu as a historical person; in this case an "Emperor of China"). Gaoyang also had a son, Gun, who fathered Yu the Great. The imperial clan of the Qin Dynasty also claimed descent through Gaoyang (though not Zhurong). Zhurong was also claimed to be an ancestor to the eight lineages of the royal families of the Chu state.

In contrast to the modern use of lamb or beef, traditional sfiha are open-faced meat pies made with ground mutton. Historically, sfiha were much like dolma—simply ground lamb, lightly spiced, wrapped in brined grape leaves. In Brazil, sfihas are folded into a triangular pastry, although the open-faced version is very common too.

[[McCawley]]

CATEGORIES: English-language surnames, Patronymic surnames

McCawley and MacCawley are surnames in the English language. The names are Anglicisations of several Gaelic-language surnames. There are several etymological origins for the names: all of which originated as patronyms in several Gaelic languages—Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Although the English-language surnames are ultimately derived from Gaelic patronyms, the English-language surnames, and the modern Gaelic-language forms do not refer to the actual name of the bearer's father or grandfather. The surnames are not very common.

[[Activation product]]
CATEGORIES: Radiation, Neutron, Radiation effects, Nuclear materials

Activation products are materials made radioactive by neutron activation.
Fission products and actinides produced by neutron absorption of nuclear fuel itself are normally referred to by those specific names, and activation product reserved for products of neutron capture by other materials, such as structural components of the nuclear reactor or nuclear bomb, the reactor coolant, control rods or other neutron poisons, or materials in the environment. All of these, however, need to be handled as radioactive waste. Some nuclides originate in more than one way, as activation products or fission products.
Activation products in a reactor's primary coolant loop are a main reason why reactors use a chain of two or even three coolant loops linked by heat exchangers.
Fusion reactors will not produce radioactive waste from the fusion product nuclei themselves, which are normally just helium-4, but generate high neutron fluxes, so activation products are a particular concern.
Activation product radionuclides include:

[[History of slavery in Indiana]]
CATEGORIES: Indiana Territory, History of Indiana, Slavery in the United States by state

Slavery in Indiana occurred between the time of French rule during late seventeenth century and 1826, with a few traces of slavery afterward. When the United States first forcibly removed the Native Americans out of the region, slavery was accepted as a necessity to keep peace with the Indians and the French. When the Indiana Territory was established in 1800, William Henry Harrison, a former slaveholder, was appointed governor and slavery continued to be tolerated through a series of laws enacted by the appointed legislature.
Opposition against slavery began to organize in Indiana around 1805, and in 1809 abolitionists took control of the territorial legislature and overturned many of the laws permitting retaining of slaves. By the time Indiana was granted statehood in 1816, the abolitionists were in firm control and slavery was banned in the constitution. In 1820, an Supreme Court of Indiana ruling in Polly v. Lasselle freed all the remaining slaves in the state. An additional Supreme Court ruling in 1821 freed indentured servant Mary Bateman Clark, helping to bring an end to indentured servitude.
With the end of slavery in the state, Indiana became a border state with the southern slave states. Hoosiers like Levi Coffin came to play an important role in the Underground Railroad that helped many slaves escape from the South. Indiana remained anti-slavery and in the American Civil War remained with the Union and contributed men to the war.

CATEGORIES: Email agents

A mail retrieval agent (MRA) is a computer application that retrieves or fetches e-mail from a remote mail server and works with a mail delivery agent to deliver mail to a local or remote email mailbox.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] MRAs may be external applications by themselves or be built into a bigger application like an MUA. Significant examples of standalone MRAs include fetchmail, getmail and retchmail.MuttWiki: MailConcept
The concept of an MRA is not standardized in email architecture. Although they operate like mail transfer agents, MRAs are technically clients when they retrieve and submit messages.

[[Pure and Simple (album)]]
CATEGORIES: Joan Jett albums, 1994 albums, Warner Bros. Records albums

Pure And Simple is the eighth studio album by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, released in 1994.
Pure and Simple was the first album to feature a new line up of Blackheart band members since the departure of longtime guitarist Ricky Byrd and bassist Kasim Sulton after the release of Jett's last album, Notorious. This new line up consisted of legendary bassist Kenny Aaronson and lead guitarist Tony "Bruno" Rey. Pure and Simple would be the last Joan Jett & the Blackhearts release until 2006's Sinner.  In 1995, both Aaronson and Rey went on to other projects. Aaronson would eventually become a member of the reunited New York Dolls – coincidentally taking over for bassist Sami Yaffa, his replacement in the Blackhearts and Rey became the musical director for Enrique Iglesias and pop sensation Rihanna.
"Hostility" and "World Of Denial" are added on the Japanese pressings. The Japanese cover differs from regular cover. "Get Off The Cross" was also recorded during these sessions. Concurrently released in the US on vinyl LP, CD, and cassette, all versions varying slightly. The record album came with a hype sticker that read "All Rock. No Ballads" and features the track "Here to Stay" co-written by Jett and Kat Bjelland. A few seconds of the song are also heard on the cassette at the very end of Side One before fading out. Jett independently put out "Spinster" as a 7-inch blue vinyl single in the US with a picture sleeve. The B-sides were "Go Home" and "Hostility". The track "World Of Denial" was eventually released in the U.S. on Jett's greatest hits album Fit To Be Tied.

[[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]]

CATEGORIES: Education in Hong Kong, Secondary school qualifications, School examinations in Hong Kong

The Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE; Traditional Chinese: 香港中學文憑) is an academic qualification offered by Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA). The HKDSE examination is the only public exam in the new 3-3-4 education system introduced in Hong Kong secondary schools, as a replacement of the previous two years of Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) and the first year of Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE) and the first year of diploma programme offered by tertiary institutions and is the new benchmark examination of the Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS, the undergraduate admission allocation system in Hong Kong). Approximately 17000 students get 5 subjects of 4 or above, it is equal to the previous HKCEE 14 points, which is equivalent to the minimal standard for studying advanced level exam for most students, so only those who score more than 5 subjects of 4 or above is viewed as having one year of advanced level qualification, while those scored below 5 subjects of 4 and above 5 subjects of 2 are viewed as having one year of pre-associate degree programme in which DSE graduates are directly admitted to associate degree programmes which HKCEE graduates need to study a year of pre-associate programme. However those who scored less than 5 subjects of level 2 also need to participate in the yijin project which is the same as students of HKCEE who scores less than 5Es. Many industry specialists in Hong Kong feel that the DSE is a close equivalent to the International Baccalaureate Diploma program, giving students two languages, Mathematics, and three elective subjects.

[[Protea caffra]]
CATEGORIES: Protea, Flora of South Africa, Garden plants of Africa, Trees of South Africa, Ornamental trees

Protea caffra is a small tree or shrub which occurs in open or wooded grassland usually on rocky ridges. Its leaves are leathery and hairless. The flower head is solitary or in clusters of 3 or 4 with the involucral bracts a pale red, pink or cream colour. The fruit is a densely hairy nut. The species is very variable and has several subspecies.
The specific epithet caffra is derived from 'Caffraria', the 17th century geographical name for the north eastern regions of South Africa, in turn a latinisation of the Islamic Arabic 'Kafir' – unbeliever.
First discovered in Natal, South Africa in December/January 1839/40 by Ferdinand Krauss, this protea has never attracted much attention from horticulturalists. It was induced to flower at Kew in May 1893, but this failed to kindle any further interest in the species. Its chief claim to fame is that it was illustrated on the reverse of the South African threepenny piece – or 'tickey' – for almost 30 years. The bark can be used medicinally.

[[Robert Morton Organ Company]]

CATEGORIES: Companies based in Los Angeles, California, San Fernando Valley

The Robert Morton Organ Company was a producer of theater pipe organs and church organs, located in Van Nuys, California.  Robert Morton was the number two volume producer of theatre organs, building approximately half as many organs as the industry leader Wurlitzer.  The name Robert Morton was derived not from any person in the company, but rather from the name of company president Harold J. Werner's son, Robert Morton Werner.
The Robert Morton company had its origins in the Murray Harris Organ Company of Los Angeles.  The company passed through various owners, business names and locations between Murray Harris and Robert Morton, including the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, the Johnston Organ Company, and the California Organ Company.  Despite all the corporate change and upheaval, the output in terms of high quality and tonal character was remarkably consistent.  Several Robert Morton key personnel were veteran organbuilders who had served as apprentices with major English organbuilding firms.  Tonally, Robert Morton organs had a reputation for being powerful, while at the same time refined and "symphonic" in character.
The company's heyday was in the late 1920s, the era of the lavish movie palace theaters exhibiting silent films. The rise of the Great Depression and the advent of sound films eliminated the demand for theater organs and the company closed in 1931. In addition to their uses in theaters and music halls, Robert Morton organs have been featured in the music for the Haunted Mansion attractions at various Disney theme parks.

Geotope is the geological component of the abiotic matrix present in an ecotope. Example geotopes might be: an exposed outcrop of rocks, an erratic boulder, a grotto or ravine, a cave, an old stone wall marking a property boundary, and so forth.
It is a loanword from German (Geotop) in the study of ecology and might be the model for many other similar words coined by analogy. As the prototype, it has enjoyed wider currency than many of the other words modelled on it, including physiotope, with which it is used synonymously. But the geotope is properly the rocks and not the whole lay of the land (which would be the physiotope).

He was, like the procurators who succeeded him, of knightly rank, and "had the power of life and death".Josephus, "B. J." ii. 8, § 1; "Ant." xviii. 1, § 1. During his administration occurred the revolt of Judas the Galilean,"B. J." l.c. the cause of which was not so much the personality of Coponius as the introduction of Roman soldiers. Owing to the reconstruction of the province of Judea then in progress, the census was being taken by Quirinius, which was a further cause of offence. 
Coponius was recalled to Rome, and replaced by Marcus Ambivulus."Ant." xviii. 2, § 2.

Burstsort and its variants are cache-efficient algorithms for sorting strings and are faster than quicksort for large data sets, first published in 2003.[tpl]cite doi|10.1145/1005813.1041517[/tpl]
Burstsort algorithms use a trie to store prefixes of strings, with growable arrays of pointers as end nodes containing sorted, unique, suffixes (referred to as buckets). Some variants copy the string tails into the buckets. As the buckets grow beyond a predetermined threshold, the buckets are "burst", giving the sort its name. A more recent variant uses a bucket index with smaller sub-buckets to reduce memory usage. Most implementations delegate to multikey quicksort, an extension of three-way radix quicksort, to sort the contents of the buckets. By dividing the input into buckets with common prefixes, the sorting can be done in a cache-efficient manner.

Lionel Charles Ferbos (born July 17, 1911) is a New Orleans jazz trumpeter.
At 102, trumpeter Lionel Ferbos is the oldest jazz musician in New Orleans.[tpl]Cite news|last = Thier|first = Dave|title = At 100, Still Keeping Time as the Leader of the Band|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-07-24|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/us/25orleans.html?_r=1|accessdate = 2011-07-27[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|last = Spera|first = Keith|title = Lionel Ferbos' Birthday Bash Worthy of his 100 Years|newspaper = The Times-Picayune|date = 2011-07-19|url = http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2011/07/lionel_ferbos_birthday_bash_wo.html |accessdate = 2012-02-28[/tpl] A native New Orleanian whose career has remained almost exclusively in the city, he appears weekly at the Palm Court Jazz Cafe, a French Quarter club, where he leads the Palm Court Jazz Band on Saturday nights.
During his long career, Ferbos has worked with some of the giants of early traditional jazz, including Captain John Handy and Mamie Smith, and more recently with widely recognized contemporary revivals of the old style music like the original stage band of the off-Broadway hit “One Mo’ Time.” [tpl]cite web |title=New Orleans Trumpeter Lionel Ferbos Still Playing Gigs at 99 |publisher=All About Jazz |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=20765 |accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] He has played at all of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festivals.
Lionel Ferbos was born July 17, 1911, in the city’s Creole 7th Ward.  He said he had asthma and his parents wouldn’t let him take up a wind instrument, but when he was 15 he saw Phil Spitalny's all-girl orchestra at the Orpheum and argued that he ought to be able to do anything a girl could do. So he got an old cornet at a pawn shop on Rampart Street and began lessons with Professor Paul Chaligny, an exacting Creole task-master who would not let him blow the horn until he knew how to read music and had mastered the rudiments of  theory. After a year with Chaligny, Ferbos moved on to study with noted musicians Albert Snaer and Eugene Ware. 
Ferbos' first professional music jobs were in the early ‘30s with society jazz bands like the Starlight Serenaders and the Moonlight Serenaders, performing at well-known New Orleans venues like the Pythian Roof Garden, Pelican Club, San Jacinto Hall, Autocrat Club, Southern Yacht Club and the New Orleans Country Club. In 1932 he joined Captain Handy’s Louisiana Shakers and played the Astoria and toured the Gulf Coast. He later backed blues singer Mamie Smith while playing with the Fats Pichon Band. During the Depression, he worked as a laborer in New Orleans City Park for the Works Progress Administration, then played first trumpet in the WPA jazz band,  of which he is the last surviving member. In the 1940s, he played on Lake Pontchartrain at the Happy Landing and Mama Lou’s, and in the ‘50s he worked with Harold Dejan at the Melody Inn, where he recorded with the “Mighty Four.” In the ‘60s he played with Herbert Leary’s Orchestra.  
Because of his ability to read sheet music, Ferbos found himself in demand. Although he wasn’t a “hot player,” as he describes it, he said he never had to scramble for work because people came to him with musical offers. When Danny Barker founded the now-famous Fairview Baptist band to train a young generation of New Orleans musicians, Ferbos was asked to write out all their charts. 
Until he reached retirement age, Ferbos kept his day job, so his musical work was mostly in and around New Orleans.  During his career he held a job at Haspel’s Clothing Factory in the early ‘30s. It was here that he met a seamstress, Marguerite Gilyot, who became his wife. She died in January 2009 after 75 years of marriage. In the 1940s, Ferbos went to work in his father’s sheet-metal business and became a master metal worker. His artistry as a tinsmith was featured in the acclaimed exhibition on Creole building arts at the New Orleans Museum of Art. In the ‘70s, he dropped out of the hit musical “One Mo’ Time” when it moved to New York, rather than leave town. However, he made eight tours of Europe with the New Orleans Ragtime Orchestra, formed to revive the old music unearthed in the jazz archives at Tulane University. He was trumpeter with the Ragtime on the soundtrack of the movie Pretty Baby.
Ferbos won the “2003 Big Easy Lifetime Achievement Award” and is frequently called on to tell about his experiences in the Depression, as well as in music and with tinsmithing, on panels and in history classes. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina blew him to Plaquemines, La., where he lived with relatives until he could return to his native New Orleans.
Despite his long career, Lionel Ferbos made few early recordings. After he joined the Ragtime and the Palm Court bands, he was recorded on several CDs on the GHB label. He is also featured on other recent recordings with New Orleans headliners on specialty labels. 
Lionel Ferbos has a daughter, Sylvia Schexnayder, and is pre-deceased by wife Marguerite Gilyot Ferbos and son Lionel Ferbos Jr.

Adenine, named after the nucleobase adenine, is a scripting language that is cross-platform, which is developed in the context of project Haystack and Project Oxygen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in collaboration with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT).
Adenine was developed as the implementation language of the Haystack Semantic Desktop.[tpl]Cite conference | publisher = ACM | isbn = 1-58113-703-6 | pages = 777–778 | last = Karger | first = David R. |author2= Dennis Quan | title = Haystack: a user interface for creating, browsing, and organizing arbitrary semistructured information | booktitle = CHI '04 extended abstracts on Human factors in computing systems | location = Vienna, Austria | year = 2004 [/tpl]  It is the perhaps the earliest example of a homoiconic general graph (rather than list/tree) programming language.
A substantial characteristic of Adenine is that this language possesses native support for the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The language constructs of Adenine are derived from Python and Lisp.
Adenine is written in RDF and thus also can be represented and written with RDF based syntaxes such as Notation3 (N3). Also, as well as RDF, Adenine can be extended. The data type system corresponds to the data type system from RDF and XML Schema, and can be extended.

[[Samuel Enoch]]

CATEGORIES: 1814 births, 1876 deaths, German rabbis

Samuel Enoch (October 8, 1814 – December 31, 1876) was a German rabbi.
Samuel Enoch was born in Hamburg.  He attended the Johannæum in Hamburg and the Talmudic lectures of Ḥakam Isaac Bernays, entered the University of Würzburg, and also became a pupil of Rabbi Abraham Bing. He obtained his Ph.D. degree at Erlangen. 
He continued his Talmudic studies with Levi Bodenheimer in Hildesheim, and R. Rohmann in Kassel; and founded in Altona a Jewish secondary school (Bürgerschule), which continued under his direction until he became (1855) rabbi of Fulda, where he remained until his death.

Avant Window Navigator (abbreviated AWN or Awn) is a dock-like bar for Linux, which sits on an edge of a user's screen and tracks open windows. Instead of representing open windows as buttons or segments on a bar, it uses icons to minimize screen space and add visual appeal. Avant Window Navigator was created by Neil J. Patel and is currently in the beta stages of development.
Both the appearance and functionality of Avant Window Navigator may be customized, and plugins and applets are available, such as to display the progress of a download in Mozilla Firefox or to control a music player like Rhythmbox.Awn Extras  The plugins use the D-Bus IPC system, and applets can be written in C, Python, or Vala. There is a sister project, AWN Extras, which is a collection of community-contributed applets and plugins.  Its releases are usually kept in sync with AWN.
One of the major requirements to run older versions of Avant Window Navigator is a compositing window manager. At least version 0.4.0-2 in the Debian repos, has either Metacity, or xcompmgr, or Compiz, or xfwm4, or KWin, or Mutter as a dependency.[tpl]cite web |url=https://packages.debian.org/squeeze/avant-window-navigator |title=Avant Window Navigator as Debian package[/tpl]
Therefore, the user was required to install a compositor,Installation (Prerequisites) - AWN Wiki such as Compiz, which could tax performance on low-end systems. Some alternatives were to use Xfce, which has a compositing manager since version 4.2.0, or to enable compositing in Metacity when using GNOME.Enabling compositing with Metacity However, support for non-composited environments is available in version 0.4.0.Milestone 0.4 for AwnOfficial release blog post

As a key stations of the Kosei Line, the station with a yard on its south side originates and terminates many trains. The station has two island platforms with two tracks each capable of serving 12-car trains, as well as sidetracks for passing trains.
Previously most of the Special Rapid Service trains from the JR Kyoto Line turned at this station until 2006 when most Special Rapid Service trains were extended to Tsuruga Station. As of 2011, there is one such train in the morning that terminates at the station.
The extension of the services to the north section required coupling and releasing of carriages at this station since platforms of Ōmi-Shiotsu Station and beyond can only handle 4-car trains. In order to facilitate these works, a signal was newly added to the track 2 of the station.

[[Villa delle Vignacce]]
CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in Lazio, Ancient city of Rome, 2nd-century architecture

Villa delle Vignacce, or the "Villa of the Vineyards", was one of the largest in the southern suburbs of ancient Rome, located on via Lemonia, in the Parco degli Acquedotti, or Acqueduct Park. Constructed in the 2nd century AD, and showing signs of restoration in the 4th century, it still remains one of Rome’s lesser documented villas, despite the extensive ruins being available in Rome’s largest public park. 
Based upon markings and studies of the brickwork, the construction of the luxurious villa is attributed to Quintus Servilius Pudens, an extremely wealthy friend of the emperor Hadrian. Of the remaining structure there is a large circular hall covered with a dome. The villa is one of the most ancient examples of “amphorae” used to lighten inside areas. In the summer of 2006, excavations were done by the American Institute for Roman Culture (AIRC), funded by the American Express Foundation. AIRC, with American, Canadian, and Italian students and professionals, unearthed the ground floor of the villa 4 meters below modern street level. 
The bath complex, complete with mosaic floors and marble walls, was discovered as well as a perfectly preserved ancient underground heating system. Rare glass paste mosaics from the 2nd century AD that had collapsed onto the ground floor were also found. In the summer of 2007, excavations revealed that the two-story complex covered more than [tpl]convert|5|acre|m2[/tpl] and contained hot rooms, vaults, changing rooms, and marble latrines. The  interior of the complex was decorated with statues and water cascades http://apnews.excite.com/article/20070720/D8QG2CVG0.html. Further excavations of the villa  and analyses will continue in the bath complex and other areas of the villa are supposed be unearthed later in the summer of 2007. 
AIRC is a non-profit organization founded in 2002 by architect Tom Rankin and classical archeologist Darius Arya.  (Rankin resigned in 2008.)

David Drew (September 19, 1930 – 25 July 2009)http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6739167.ece was a British journalist on music, particularly known for his work on Kurt Weill. He published the authoritative catalogue of Weill's music, Kurt Weill: A Handbook (London, 1987) and, in German, edited and annotated a collection of Weill's writings, Kurt Weill: Ausgewählte Schriften, and a symposium of writings by others about Weill, Über Kurt Weill (both Frankfurt, 1975). He also produced performing editions of many of Weill's works and devised the significant celebration and revival of many of Weill's works at the 1975 Berliner Musikfest; much of this project was later recorded by the participating artists and the London Sinfonietta conducted by David Atherton and issued by the Decca Record Company in 1976.
Other composers he was known for advocating were the Pole Henryk Górecki,http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/david-drew-music-publisher-advocate-for-composer-henryk-gorecki-dies-at-78-2009-07-29 Americans Elliott Carter and Roger Sessions, Germans and Austrians HK Gruber, Kurt Schwertsik, Berthold Goldschmidt, Leopold Spinner, Boris Blacher and Rudolf Wagner-Régeny, Italian Luigi Dallapiccola, Catalan exile Roberto Gerhard (a close friend from his student days in Cambridge), conductor-composer Igor Markevitch and British composers Alexander Goehr, Robin Holloway, Christopher Shaw and Walter Leigh. He first drew attention with the first important articles on Olivier Messiaen to be published in English, in the journal The Score, and his 60-page chapter on 'Modern French Music', in the 1957 symposium European Music in the Twentieth Century edited by Howard Hartog (Routledge, later Pelican books 1961).
He was editor of the music journal Tempo from 1971 to 1982 and wrote several hundred articles for the music press.http://www.singscript.plus.com/daviddrewmusic/articles.htm For Boosey & Hawkes he was editor of Tempo magazine in 1971, then Director of Publications in 1975, becoming Director of New Music until he left the company in 1992.http://www.boosey.com/cr/news/Boosey-Hawkes-publisher-David-Drew-dies-aged-78/11873
In the 1960s and 1970s he devised, managed and edited an important series of recordings of 20th-century and contemporary music under the aegis of the Gulbenkian Foundation. Known as 'Music Today', the first albums of the series - almost entirely consisting of first recordings and including premiere recordings of music by Roberto Gerhard, Nikos Skalkottas, Dallapiccola, Stefan Wolpe, Charles Koechlin, Messiaen, Pierre Boulez and the two symphonies of Kurt Weill - were issued by EMI Records. They were reissued in the 1970s, along with a new batch of recordings, by Argo Records. After his departure from Boosey & Hawkes, Drew worked in a similar capacity producing recordings for the German label Largo Records - these included a Weill album, 'Berlin im Licht', a series of recordings of music by Berthold Goldschmidt, and a double album including works by Weill, Blacher, Goldschmidt, Milhaud, Vaughan Williams and Harrington Shortall entitled Testimonies of War: Kriegzeugnisse 1914-45.

He is considered to be one of the most promising Welsh composers of his generation and a key figure in current Welsh music. Puw's music has been broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and been featured on television programmes for the BBC and S4C. He has twice been awarded the Composer's Medal at the National Eisteddfod.
Puw's works include pieces for unusual combinations of instruments, such as a tuba quartet or a trio consisting of harp, cello and double-bass, as well as more traditional forces such as solo baritone and piano, choir or orchestra. He was associated with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales as its Resident Composer, the first holder of this title, from 2006 to 2009. Puw wrote an Oboe concerto as part of this association, and his latest composition for the orchestra was premiered at the 2007 Proms. Puw's own Welsh identity is a recurrent theme in his music: some of his pieces set Welsh-language poetry to music and one of his pieces, Reservoirs, is written about the flooding of Welsh valleys to provide water for England.

During its course it is fed by numerous of water courses; those with the greatest flows are the Stabina, from  Valtorta, the Parina, the Enna, a torrente of the Val Taleggio which joins the Brembo in the small town of San Giovanni Bianco, the Ambria, a torrente of the Valle Serina and the Dordo, a stream of Isola di Bergamo.Isola di Bergamo is a traditional and geopgraphical region which lies between the mountains and the rivers Adda and Brembo. See http://www.isoladibergamo.net/pagina%201.html
The Brembo flows into the Adda near Crespi d'Adda, between the communes of Capriate San Gervasio, Canonica d'Adda and Vaprio d'Adda, at the border between the provinces of Bergamo and Milan.
In the course of the centuries the river has seen many floods, often on a disastrous scale as was the case on 18 July 1987 when immense damage was done to the environs of the Val Brembana.

Beckenham Road tram stop is a light rail stop in the London Borough of Bromley in the southern suburbs of London. The stop is located on an embankment above Beckenham Road (A234) which connects Beckenham with Crystal Palace and Penge on the site of the short-lived (1858–1860) West End of London & Crystal Palace Railway Penge station."Railways of Beckenham", Andrew Hajducki, 2011[tpl]page needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] 
The tram stop is served by Tramlink route 2, which connects central Croydon with Beckenham.[tpl]cite web | title = Buses and trams from Beckenham Road | publisher = Transport for London | url = http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/gettingaround/maps/buses/pdf/beckenhamroad-11313.pdf | accessdate = 2007-01-30[/tpl]
The tram stop is close to Clock House railway station on the National Rail Hayes Line, which lies on the other side of Beckenham Road and at a considerably lower level. Bus stops on roads adjacent to the stop provide interchange with the following bus services (as of January 2008):
The tram stop has a single platform which is accessed by steps and a ramp from Beckenham Road. The single track National Rail line between Crystal Palace and Beckenham Junction stations runs alongside the Tramlink line, with the two tracks occupying the site of what was previously a double track railway. However there is no station on this line. Immediately to the east of the tram stop is a passing loop for Tramlink vehicles, and westbound trams often have to wait for an eastbound tram to clear the stop.

Puzzle Play was an Australian pre-school themed TV show for young kids. It aired Monday to Friday from 8:30 am to 9:00 am on Network Ten. The program premiered on 21 December 2006 replacing the program In the Box. The hosts were Kellyn Morris, Liam Nunan and Patrick MacDonald. There was also Cassie (voiced by Kristen Souvlis) which was a computer with a female voice and Penny, a cartoon bus-like vehicle that took the hosts to various locations. Penny makes a beeping sound. The plot involved Cassie presenting a 4-piece puzzle with a shape on each piece. As the show continued, a clue was shown for each piece. Each clue was usually a video with a host narrating about the shape with information about it. The hosts visited schools, preschools, kindergartens and parks. As the pieces were being removed, a picture was revealed in the background and in the end the 3 hosts guessed what the picture was about. All the pieces were related to final picture.
Before the show was aired, it replaced the show "In the Box". Puzzle Play was replaced on 31 January 2011 by "Wurrawhy".

CATEGORIES: The Rolling Stones songs, Songs written by Jagger/Richards, 1974 songs, Song recordings produced by the Glimmer Twins

"Fingerprint File" is the closing track from the Rolling Stones' 1974 album It's Only Rock 'n Roll. It is one of their first attempts to branch out into dance or electronic music, and the song resembles music by Sly and the Family Stone. Key ingredients of the song are the rhythm guitar played by Mick Jagger, which features heavy phasing due to the use of the MXR Phase 100 effects pedal, and the highly jazz/funk-oriented bass guitar played by Mick Taylor. Keith Richards uses the wah-wah pedal for his guitar part. Bill Wyman is on synthesiser, Charlie Watts on drums, Billy Preston on clavinet, and Nicky Hopkins on piano. Charlie Jolly Kunjappu is featured on the tabla.
The lyrics, similar to David Bowie's "1984", released the same year, express frustration over government monitoring and surveillance activity, perhaps inspired by reports of the wiretapping of domestic "radical" groups in the US during the Nixon Administration.
A live version is featured on the 1977 live album Love You Live and the 1975 live album L.A. Friday (Live 1975), recorded during the Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas '75.

He graduated from Manchester University with First Class Honours in 1912, where he joined a team of notable scientists led by Sir Ernest Rutherford (later Lord Rutherford), including Henry Moseley, Hans Geiger, Niels Bohr, Ernest Marsden, James Chadwick, George de Hevesy and Charles Galton Darwin. In 1914 he was appointed a research fellow at the University of Liverpool and then a Lecturer in Physics.  He still kept in touch with Rutherford, who was working on underwater acoustics, and arranged for him to work on countering the German naval threat.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]
He joined the Board of Invention and Research in October 1915, shortly after its creation, to help with the UK war effort against Germany.

Wood married his wife Ethel in 1916. He was awarded his DSc degree by his university in 1919 and became a Fellow of the Physical Society in 1920.  He was a founder member of the Institute of Physics. In 1930 he wrote the first edition of "Text Book of Sound" which was the standard work on the subject for many years. In 1939 A B Wood was awarded the title Officer of the Order of the British Empire, in recognition of his work on dismantling a German magnetic mine at the start of the Second World War.
In 1951 he was awarded the Duddell Medal by the Institute of Physics http://www.iop.org/activity/awards/Senior_Awards/The_Duddell_Medal_and_Prize/Duddell_award_recipients/page_10137.html and in 1961 the Pioneers of Underwater Acoustics Medal by the Acoustical Society of America.  http://asa.aip.org/awards.html

Astronomers announced their discovery on May 30, 2007, at the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii. Its discovery is attributed to the combined effort of amateur and professional astronomers working together on the XO Project using a telescope located on the Haleakala summit in Hawaii.Space oddity: Astronomers discover giant planet, The Times of India
Dubbed an "oddball" planet, the planet stands out from over 350 other extrasolar planets as the most massive planet found in close proximity to a star, yet the orbit is significantly elliptical instead of circular, as would be expected. It is also considered a transiting planet, passing in front of its parent star during each orbit.

During this period, Colombian media portrayed Cuero as "one of the greatest scientists in the world"  who was internationally acknowledged as one of the greatest Colombian inventors, stated he had over 100 publications in scientific journals, and claimed he had won a significant award from NASA. Since 2012, he has been the research director of International Park of Creativity, an organization of which he is the founder.
In 2013, an El Espectador investigation alleged Cuero's curriculum vitae mixed in trivial publications with his peer-reviewed work, listed publications that did not appear to exist, misstated his invention record and employment at NASA and possibly fabricated several awards and honors.  This contradicted Cuero's reputation as a leading researcher. In a follow-up interview with the paper, Cuero clarified he had contracted with NASA, could not recall the origin of the award in question, stated that 11 of the 13 patents claimed on his CV were still going through the approval process, and confirmed he had five  peer reviewed articles published in the past 14 years.

Agriprocessors was the corporate identity of a slaughterhouse and meat-packaging factory based in Postville, Iowa, best known as a facility for the glatt kosher processing of cattle, as well as chicken, turkey, duck,  and lamb. Agriprocessors' meat and poultry products were marketed under the brand Iowa Best Beef.  Its kosher products were marketed under various labels, including Aaron’s Best, Shor Habor, Supreme Kosher and Rubashkins.
The firm was founded and owned by Aaron Rubashkin, who purchased the meat-packing facility in 1987, and managed by two of his sons, Sholom Rubashkin and Heshy Rubashkin. Eventually it became the largest kosher meat-packing plant in the United States.
Agriprocessors faced accusations of mistreatment of cattle, pollution, and a series of alleged violations of labor law. In May 2008, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staged a raid of the plant, and arrested nearly 400 illegal immigrant workers. Agriprocessors plants stopped operating in October 2008, and the firm filed for bankruptcy on November 5 of the same year. Sholom Rubashkin as the highest ranking day-to-day corporate officer was charged with federal financial fraud and sentenced to 27 years in prison in June 2010. 
The Agriprocessors plant was bought at auction in July 2009 by SHF Industries and has resumed production under the new name Agri Star.

[[Szmalcownik]]

CATEGORIES: Collaboration during World War II

Szmalcownik ([tpl]IPA-pol|ʂmalˈtsɔvɲik[/tpl]) is a pejorative Polish slang word used during World War II that denoted a person blackmailing Jews who were hiding, or blackmailing Poles who protected Jews during the Nazi occupation.[tpl]cite book|last=Jan|first=Grabowski|title="Ja tego żyda znam!": szantażowanie żydów w Warszawie, 1939–1943 / "I know this Jew!": Blackmailing of the Jews in Warsaw 1939-1945|url=http://www.holocaustresearch.pl/publikacje(en).htm|year=2004|publisher=Wydawn. IFiS PAN : Centrum Badań nad Zagładą Żydów|location=Warsaw, Poland|language=Polish|isbn=83-7388-058-5| oclc=60174481[/tpl]
The term's origins is the word szmalec (Polish: dough, literally "lard"), emphasizing money as the most important reason behind blackmailing.
The Polish Secret State considered szmalcownictwo an act of collaboration with the German occupiers. The Armia Krajowa (Home Army) punished it with the death sentence as a criminal act of treason.Źródło: Żydzi polscy, zeszyt 24, "Sprawiedliwi wśród narodów" str. 11 artykuł "Śmierć dla szmalcowników" dodatek do Rzeczpospolitej z 23 września 2008 Blackmailers had been sentenced to death by the Special Courts of the Polish Underground for crimes against Polish citizens. The Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego (Polish Committee of National Liberation) by its decree of 31 August 1944 also condemned this act as collaboration with Nazi Germany. This decree is still a valid law in Poland, and any person who committed an act of szmalcownictwo during the war faces life imprisonment.
Blackmailers (szmalcownicy) were plentiful in Warsaw, sometimes gangs of them. Gunnar S. Paulsson estimates that their total numbers were as high as "3-4 thousand" in Warsaw.Biuletyn IPN  3 (12)/2013, p. 5, Instytut Pamięci Narodowej The damage that these criminals did was substantial. Most were interested in money. By stripping Jews of assets needed for food and bribes, harassing rescuers, raising the overall level of insecurity, and forcing hidden Jews to seek out safer accommodation, blackmailers added significantly to the danger Jews faced and increased their chances of getting caught and killed. Jews who lived on the Aryan side were more afraid of szmalcowniks than of the Germans because Polish blackmailers were experts in distinguishing Jewish facial features. At the beginning of the German oppression, szmalcowniks were satisfied with a few hundred zlotys in extortion, but after the death penalty for hiding Jews was introduced the sums rose to several hundred thousand zlotys.
Paradoxically, Germans sometimes treated szmalcowniks as criminals and imposed punishments on them. The reason was that szmalcowniks also bribed German officials and policemen — after the denunciation of a rich Jew, szmalcowniks and corrupted Germans shared the robbed money.

[[Fuel management systems]]
CATEGORIES: Fuels

Fuel management systems are used to maintain, control and monitor fuel consumption and stock in any type of industry that uses transport, including rail, road, water and air, as a means of business.
Fuel management systems are designed to effectively measure and manage the use of fuel within the transportation and construction industries. They are typically used for fleets of vehicles, including railway vehicles and aircraft, as well as any vehicle that requires fuel to operate. They employ various methods and technologies to monitor and track fuel inventories, fuel purchases and fuel dispensed. This information can be then stored in computerized systems and reports generated with data to inform management practices. Online fuel management is provided through the use of web portals to provide detailed fueling data, usually vis a vis the back end of an automated fuel management system. This enables consumption control, cost analysis and tax accounting for fuel purchases
There are several types of fuel management systems. Card-based fuel management systems typically track fuel transactions based on a fueling credit card and the associated driver PIN. Reports can then be generated based on fuel consumption by driver, and data can be directly downloaded. On-site fuel management systems may employ fleet refueling services or bulk fuel tanks at the site. Fuel is tracked as it is pumped into vehicles, and on-site storage levels can be managed.
Some fuel companies offer total fuel management systems whereby they provide elements of a card-based system along with on-site fuel delivery and refueling services. Mobile fuel management refers to a fleet of fuel trucks or tankers which provide fuel supply to commercial fleets of trucks or construction equipment. May involve combining RFID technology to identify equipment and automated fuel management to append the details of each transaction to a unique piece of equipment. By refueling vehicles in the evening when they are not in use, the company can conserve man-hours as the operators do not refuel and the vehicles do not require additional fuel to travel to the refueling station. They may also employ more sophisticated systems that utilize remote data collection to gather specific technical information about the vehicle usage and performance characteristics such as mileage, hours of operation and engine idling time.
The increasing use of biofuel has introduced another challenge in fuel management. With greater water content, there will be a risk of microbial growth – depending on the storage conditions, the fuel quality will deteriorate over time, leading to clogged filters and loss of productivity. 
Tank manufacturers have introduced fuel filtering and cleansing packs which recirculate the tank contents through a series of filters and ultra-violet treatment to kill bacteria. Data from fuel quality instrumentation can be streamed to allow remote monitoring over Internet connections.

CATEGORIES: Automata theory, Probabilistic models

In mathematics and computer science, the probabilistic automaton (PA) is a generalization of the non-deterministic finite automaton; it includes the probability of a given transition into the transition function, turning it into a transition matrix or stochastic matrix. Thus, the probabilistic automaton generalizes the concept of a Markov chain or subshift of finite type. The languages recognized by probabilistic automata are called stochastic languages; these include the regular languages as a subset. The number of stochastic languages is uncountable.
The concept was introduced by Michael O. Rabin in 1963;M. O Rabin,"Probabilistic Automata", Information and Control 6 (1963) pp. 230–245 a certain special case is sometimes known as the Rabin automaton. In recent years, a variant has been formulated in terms of quantum probabilities, the quantum finite automaton.

Sha Lan Tsuen (Chinese: 沙欄村) is a small village in Hong Kong, to the east of the Tai Po New Town. Its village mainly comprises the Lee family of the Hakka origin and they have been living there for more than a century.
It is a rural village of Hong Kong and is presently seeing major changes in construction of new flats and new roads. The village is based along the coastline of the New Territories district of Hong Kong and has a small beach. The area to which Sha Lan Tsuen belongs, Shuen Wan (船灣), due to being in the rural and having beautiful coastline scenery, has attracted many wealthy Estate Companies to build luxury flats that spans right across the whole area. One such projects is "The Beverly Hills" estate owned by the Henderson Land Development Group. The luxury flats boast a magnificent scenery and costs more than HK$10,000,000. Although socially upgrading the area, it has somewhat spoilt the natural landscape and overcrowded the whole area, according to local people living in the village.

[[Goaltender interference]]
CATEGORIES: Ice hockey rules

Goaltender interference is a penalty in ice hockey whereby a player is found in the goal crease when a goalie is establishing his position in the same area.
Under the NHL rule book (# 69), this will result in a minor penalty to the offending player.  If a goal is scored as a result of a player obstructing the goaltender, the goal will be disallowed and a minor penalty assessed at the referee's discretion. In leagues where goaltender interference isn't an official penalty, a charging penalty is called instead.

[[New Orleans Jazz Museum]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct museums in the United States, French Quarter, Museums in New Orleans, Louisiana, Music museums in Louisiana

The New Orleans Jazz Museum was a museum related to the history of New Orleans jazz.  Originally a separate museum, the collection is now in the Louisiana State Museum Jazz Collection.
Plans for a museum commemorating New Orleans jazz were begun in the 1950s by a collaborative group of New Orleans jazz collectors and enthusiasts of the New Orleans Jazz Club (founded 1949).  Key movers were Edmond "Doc" Souchon, Myra Menville, and Helen Arlt. 
The museum opened in 1961 at 1017 Dumaine Street in the French Quarter with Clay Watson as curator. This location is maintained today as the site of the current Hotel St. Pierre, including commemorative plaques on the property.
The museum collection includes many instruments used by New Orleans jazz greats, perhaps most famously Louis Armstrong's first cornet.[tpl]cite book| last = Halsey| first = William Darach| authorlink = | title = Collier's Encyclopedia, with Bibliography and Index| publisher = P.F. Collier| year = 1986| page = 439| doi = | isbn = [/tpl] In 1969 the museum relocated to the Royal Sonesta Hotel. In the early 1970s the hotel changed ownership. The museum then relocated in 1973 to 833 Conti Street, but soon went bankrupt. The collection went in storage and was then donated to the Louisiana State Museum on September 15, 1977.[tpl]cite web| last = | first = | title = The Louisiana State Museum Jazz Collection | url=http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/collections/jazz.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-31 [/tpl]  
In the early 1980s the jazz collection reopened on the second floor of the New Orleans Mint building under the curatorship of Don Marquis.  In addition to the museum exhibit, the collection donated by the New Orleans Jazz Club includes research material (including letters, photographs, and interviews) available to researchers by appointment.
The Old Mint Building was damaged by Hurricane Katrina at the end of August 2005, including some damage to the jazz collection. As of June 2007, conservation and repair work is ongoing; a reopening date has not yet been announced as of July 2009.[tpl]cite web| last = | first = | title = The Louisiana State Museum - Old US Mint | url=http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/mintex.htm| accessdate = 2007-06-02 [/tpl]

[[Neck guard]]
CATEGORIES: Ice hockey equipment, Protective gear

A neck guard is a piece of protective equipment worn by ice hockey players around the neck area. The guard is to prevent injury to the neck by pucks, hockey sticks, and skate blades.
This piece is critical to goaltenders, who are more likely at risk to be injured in this area. Goalie Clint Malarchuk suffered a severe injury during a game in 1989 when two players collided in front of his goal and one player's skate caught on his neck, slicing open his internal jugular vein. He most likely would have died were immediate medical help not available. Ever since then, NHL regulations have required goalies to wear neck guards.
On February 10, 2008, Florida Panthers forward Richard Zedník was behind the play and skating into the right corner of the Buffalo Sabres' zone, when teammate Olli Jokinen lost his balance after being checked by Clarke MacArthur. Jokinen fell head-first to the ice, and his right leg flew up and struck Zedník directly on the side of the neck, hitting Zedník's external carotid artery. Clutching his neck, Zedník raced to the Florida bench, leaving a long trail of blood. When he arrived, he nearly fell into the arms of a team trainer. He recovered fully from the injury.
The neck guard contains fabric that is BNQ certified. Most neck guards have a moisture system which let's the player keep cool while working so their neck guard won't get hot.

[[Seoul Anglican Cathedral English Mission]]
CATEGORIES: Cathedrals in South Korea, Churches in Seoul

Seoul Anglican Cathedral English Mission is an Anglican church in  Korea. Anglican worship in English has been held on the site of the present Seoul Anglican Cathedral since its predecessor the Church of the Advent held its first Holy Communion service on 21 December 1890. Even after the first missionaries had learned enough Korean and translated the liturgy according to the Book of Common Prayer into Korean, worship services in English continued for members of the foreign community in Seoul who desired Anglican or Episcopal Church services in that language. It is probable that the only time services in English have been discontinued at Seoul Cathedral were during the Second World War, when Korea was under Japanese occupation, and during those periods of the Korean War when Seoul was captured by North Korean forces.http://www.anglicanhistory.org/asia/kr
The English Mission has traditionally worshiped in the smaller Crypt Chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist which is also called the Advent Chapel to commemorate the Church of the Advent which the Cathedral replaced. The Rt. Reverend Mark Trollope is buried in the Crypt Chapel and his remains lie under a copperplate engraving of him by Francis Cooper which was completed in 1932. At present up to one hundred worshipers, foreigners and Koreans, gather in the Crypt Chapel for Holy Communion in English every Sunday at 9.30 am. At other times the Chapel is used for Korean Language Worship. As from the very beginnings of the English Mission the congregation is drawn from many different countries and is united by a desire to worship in the Anglican-Episcopal usage in the English language. The growth in numbers and nationalities attending services at the English Mission in the period from the mid-1990s onwards reflects the growth of Seoul as an East Asian mega city with over 180,000 foreign dwellers recorded in 2007.
In a small space located at the top right corner of the crypt, the remains of the first consecrated Korean Anglican archbishop, Rev. Lee, Cheon-Hwan lies in peace.

CATEGORIES: Alkynes, Nanotechnology

NanoPutians are a series of organic molecules whose structural formulae resemble human forms.[tpl]cite doi|10.1021/jo0349227[/tpl] James Tour et al. (Rice University) designed and synthesized these compounds in 2003 as a part of a sequence of chemical education for young students.[tpl]cite doi|10.1021/ed080p395[/tpl] The compounds consist of two benzene rings connected via a few carbon atoms as the body, four acetylene units each carrying an alkyl group at their ends which represents the hands and legs, and a 1,3-dioxolane ring as the head. Tour and his team at Rice University used the NanoPutians in their NanoKids educational outreach program. The goal of this program was to educate children in the sciences in an effective and enjoyable manner. They have made several videos featuring the NanoPutians as anthropomorphic animated characters.
Construction of the structures depends on Sonogashira coupling and other synthetic techniques. By replacing the 1,3-dioxolane group with an appropriate ring structure, various other types of putians have been synthesized, e.g. NanoAthlete, NanoPilgrim, and NanoGreenBeret. Placing thiol functional groups at the leg enables them to "stand" on a gold surface.
"NanoPutian" is a portmanteau of nanometer, a unit of length commonly used to measure chemical compounds, and lilliputian, a fictional population of humans in the novel Gulliver's Travels.

[[The Letter (play)]]
CATEGORIES: 1927 plays, English plays, Plays by W. Somerset Maugham, Plays adapted into films, Heinemann (publisher) books

The Letter is a play by W. Somerset Maugham dramatised from a short story that first appeared in his 1926 collection The Casuarina Tree. The story is based on a  real-life scandal involving the wife of the headmaster of a school in Kuala Lumpur who was convicted in a murder trial after shooting dead a male friend in April 1911. She was eventually pardoned.
In the play, the action takes place in the house of a plantation owner, Robert Crosbie, and his wife Leslie in the then-British colony of Malaya, and later in the Chinese quarter of Singapore. With the husband away on business, the wife claims that she shot the mutual friend, Geoff Hammond, in self-defence, following an attempted rape, and the play focuses on the steps taken by the wife's lawyer to convince the court of her innocence, following the discovery of an incriminating letter. The letter was an invention of Maugham's for dramatic effect.
Gladys Cooper both produced and starred in the London premiere of the play in 1927 at the Playhouse Theatre where it ran for 60 weeks, including a tour of the Provinces. The part of the husband was played by Nigel Bruce. Directed by Gerald du Maurier, this play was the first that Cooper had produced on her own and proved to be an important milestone in her theatrical career. In return for Cooper agreeing to produce the play, Maugham offered her an option on his next three plays: The Constant Wife, which she refused, The Sacred Flame, which she accepted, and The Breadwinner, which she also declined. Later that year the first Broadway production opened September 26, 1927 at the Morosco Theatre (Broadway) starred Katharine Cornell, Swezo Kotoro, John Buckler, Allan Jeayes and J. W. Austin. 
The play was revived in 1995 at the Lyric Hammersmith, directed by Neil Bartlett and starring Joanna Lumley and Tim Pigott-Smith, and in 2007 at Wyndham's Theatre, directed by Alan Strachan and starring Jenny Seagrove and Anthony Andrews.

Its role model is the Hanseatic League of the late Middle Ages, but its focus is on the Baltic Sea region, whereas the original League had a much larger field of operations. The Parliament seeks to foster a common identity in the Baltic Sea region, for example through the annual Hanseatic Conference, at which it academics, politicians and businesspeople discuss culturally related topics.
The organisation is implementing several EU-funded projects, also flagship projects within the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, that was initiated in 2009.EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region In 2010 the Hanseatic Parliament established the Baltic Sea Academy, a non-profit network of 15 academic institutions with the common goal to bridge the gap between R&D institutions and SMEs.

The V-modelKevin Forsberg and Harold Mooz, “The Relationship of System Engineering to the Project Cycle,” in Proceedings of the First Annual Symposium of National Council on System Engineering, October 1991: 57–65. represents a software development process (also applicable to hardware development) which may be considered an extension of the waterfall model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. The horizontal and vertical axes represents time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.

[[Güllaç]]

CATEGORIES: Turkish words and phrases, Turkish pastries, Turkish inventions

Güllaç (pronounced [tpl]IPA-tr|ˈɟylːatʃ|[/tpl]) is a Turkish dessert made with milk, pomegranate and a special kind of pastry. It is consumed especially during Ramadan.
Güllaç is considered as being the origin of baklava.[tpl]cite book|title=A soup for the Qan: Chinese dietary medicine of the Mongol era as seen in Hu Szu-Hui's Yin-shan cheng-yao|year=2010|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=90-04-18020-6|author=Husihui|edition=2nd rev. and expanded ed.|coauthors=Paul D. Buell, Eugene N. Anderson; appendix by Charles Perry[/tpl] The similarities between the two desserts are many, such as the use of thin layers of dough and nuts in between. Güllaç dough is now prepared with corn starch and wheat flour, although originally it was made only with wheat starch. Güllaç contains walnuts between the layers that are put in milk.
Its first known mention is in a 14th-century book, Yinshan Zhenyao ([tpl]lang|zh|飮膳正要[/tpl]), a food and health manual written by Husihui ([tpl]lang|zh|忽思慧[/tpl]), a Turkic physician to the Mongol court of the Yuan dynasty. The book documents primarily Mongol and Turkic dishes that exhibit a limited amount of Chinese influence.
Güllaç was used for making Güllaç Lokması and Güllaç Baklavası, archaic Turkish desserts made during Ottoman period in Turkey. The etymology of Güllaç is actually combination of two words Güllü and aş, meaning "food with roses". Although the dessert itself may contain rose leaves and rose syrup, the name actually refers to the shape of layers which look similar to leaves of roses.

CATEGORIES: Paraneoplastic syndromes, Immune system disorders

A paraneoplastic syndrome is a disease or symptom that is the consequence of cancer in the body but, unlike mass effect, is not due to the local presence of cancer cells.Paraneoplastic Syndromes, 2011, Darnell & Posner These phenomena are mediated by humoral factors (by hormones or cytokines) excreted by tumor cells or by an immune response against the tumor. Paraneoplastic syndromes are typical among middle aged to older patients, and they most commonly present with cancers of the lung, breast, ovaries or lymphatic system (a lymphoma).NINDS Paraneoplastic Syndromes Information Page National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Sometimes the symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes show before the diagnosis of a malignancy, which has been hypothesized to relate to the disease pathogenesis.  In this paradigm, tumor cells express tissue-restricted antigens (such as neuronal proteins), triggering an anti-tumor immune response which may be partially or, rarely, completely effective[tpl]cite |journal=Lancet |author=Darnell,R.B., DeAngelis,L.M. |title=Regression of small-cell lung carcinoma in patients with paraneoplastic neuronal antibodies |volume=341|issue=8836 |pages=21–22 |year=1993 |pmid= 8093269[/tpl] in suppressing tumor growth and symptoms.[tpl]cite |journal=Current Opinion in Immunology |author=Roberts,W.K., Darnell,R.B. |title=Neuroimmunology of the paraneoplastic neurological degenerations |volume=16|issue=5 |pages=616–622 |year=2004 |pmid= 15342008 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2004.07.009[/tpl][tpl]cite |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |author=Albert,M.A., Darnell,R.B. |title=Paraneoplastic neurological degenerations: keys to tumour immunity |volume=4|issue=1 |pages=36–44 |year=2004 |pmid= 14708025[/tpl]  Patients then come to clinical attention when this tumor immune response breaks immune tolerance and begins to attack the normal tissue expressing that (e.g. neuronal) protein.

[[Ganibatum]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Syria

Ganibatum is a place and people mentioned in the 18th century BC Old Babylonian texts from Mari (modern Tell Harari). 
Ganibatum is believed to be located near Dur Yahdun Lim but other suggestions remain viable. In fact there may be several locations associated with the Ganibatum who appear involved in the transport of people and goods along the Euphrates and connected waterways. The Gnbtyw people (Genebtyw or Genebtyu) first appear in Thutmosis Year 32 (ca. 1448 BC) and once again in a superscription dating to the time of Ramesses II (Kitchen 1999 p, 104-105). 
Previously the Gnbtyw have been sought to the south of Egypt and associated with the land of Punt. But this association has relied almost entirely on the similarity of trade goods and uncertain textual contexts (Saleh, 1972). An identification with the Gnbtyw people bringing aromatic goods to Egypt after Thutmoses III’s campaign to Syria in the mid 15th century BC has recently been proposed (Storck, 2005). If the newly proposed identification of Ganibatum with Gnbtyw finds acceptance, then the people/place of Ganibatum certainly moved after the destruction of Mari and the decline of Dur Yahdun Lim, perhaps to be connected with Galabatha near the confluence of the Balih and Euphrates (Burke, 1961). 
Thutmosis III might have encountered the people of Ganibatum (Gnbtyw) in the course of his campaign that explicitly reached the Euphrates in Syria. Indeed slightly later campaigns of Thutmosis III in Northern Syria resulted in “presents” (inw) from the even further lands of Babylon, Assur and “Great Hatti” (Singer, 2004 p. 605-607).

Laʻibum was an Akkadian man. He is mentioned once in the Sumerian Sargon legend as the father of Sargon of Akkad. No details about his life or historicity are known, although the Sumerian king list states that Sargon's father was a gardener, while a much later neo-Assyrian account has Sargon say "My mother was lowly, my father I knew not, and the brother of my father dwelleth in the mountain."
He was presumably an Akkadian. The neo-Assyrian text also asserts that Sargon was from Azupiranu; this may have been Laʻibum's native town. Laʻibum was a grandfather of kings Rimush and Manishtushu.

In English law, the Assize of novel disseisin ("recent dispossession") was an action to recover lands of which the plaintiff had been disseised, or dispossessed. The action became extremely popular due to its expediency. Rather than dealing with the issue of lawful possession, it simply asked whether a dispossession had taken place, in which case the property was restored to the plaintiff, and the question of true ownership was dealt with later.
It was one of the so-called "petty assizes" established by the Assize of Clarendon by Henry II in 1166. Like the other two assizes, it was abolished in 1833.[tpl]1911[/tpl]

USS ''Planter'' (1860) was a steamer taken over by Robert Smalls, a Southern slave and ship's pilot who steered the ship past Confederate defenses and surrendered it to Union Navy forces on 13 May 1862 during the American Civil War. 
For a short period, Planter served as a gunboat for the Union Navy. As the ship burned wood, which was scarce where the Navy was operating, the Navy turned the ship over to the Union Army for use at Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast. In 1863 Smalls was appointed captain of Planter, the first black man to command a United States ship, and served in that position to 1866.

This change effectively dropped the school's enrollment from over 1,000 in the mid and late 20th century.  The current enrollment after dropping to a point between 400 and 500 now numbers around 750.
The school is of course famous of many of its football athletes.  Other local alumni who either graduated from Etowah or attended it include:
Many more students have passed through the halls of Etowah High School, and many have gone on to become huge successes in their own rights.  Its commitment to education and leadership in the community is at the highest caliber. On a closing note, the school's page here is constantly re-edited by those who feel that only the football players who went on to college (and many more than are listed here did so) are the only ones who attended who are worth mentioning. Each time it is updated with other notable alumni, many believe that the same people come back in and re-edit the page to reflect only football players who have achieved success. While this is not fair to others who have gone on to great success themselves, we digress and now return your page to be re-edited, once again, and hope that many of you read it and see that it is not only football players who have achieved greatness from this school.

[[Endothelial progenitor cell]]
CATEGORIES: Blood cells

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are a population of rare cells that circulate in the blood with the ability to differentiate into endothelial cells, the cells that make up the lining of blood vessels. The process by which blood vessels are born de novo from endothelial progenitor cells is known as vasculogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cells participate in pathologic angiogenesis such as that found in retinopathy and tumor growth.
Various cytokines, growth factors, and hormones cause hematopoietic cells, and by association endothelial progenitor cells, to be mobilized into the peripheral circulation, ultimately homing to regions of blood vessel formation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Asahara T, et al.| title = Bone marrow origin of endothelial progenitor cells responsible for postnatal vasculogenesis in physiological and pathological neovascularization | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 221–8 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10436164 [/tpl]
Endothelial progenitor cells can be marked using the Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 (ID1).[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/nm1101-1194[/tpl] This allows for tracking endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood to the tumour-stroma and even incorporated in tumour vasculature.

Together with the Swiss jurist Gustave Moynier, he founded the Institut de Droit International and became its first Honorary President.
Even though his personal convictions were deeply religious, he is considered anti-clerical because of his staunch defence of the Separation of church and state. Serving as an advisor to King Rama V of Thailand, he played a crucial role in the reformation of that country to modern western standards and was awarded the title Chow Phya Abhai Raja, the highest distinction ever granted to a foreigner.
Rolin-Jaequemyns' reputation as an expert on international law was widely recognized. He became a member of several national academies, for example 1870 in Montreal, 1872 in Madrid, in 1874 in Belgium and 1881 in Constantinople. In 1877, the University of Edinburgh granted him the title of Doctor Honoris Causa, and later he received the same distinction from the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Brussels. In 1889 King Leopold II of Belgium appointed him member of the High Council for the independent state of Congo.

[[Joseph ben Baruch]]
CATEGORIES: 13th-century rabbis, French Tosafists, Rabbis in Jerusalem

Joseph ben Baruch was a French rabbi, a tosafist of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Gross identifies him with Joseph of Clisson. Joseph resided for some time in Paris, where he associated with Judah Sir Leon and instructed Samuel of Falaise in special subjects.
In 1211 he emigrated with his brother Meïr to Palestine by way of Egypt. It was probably Joseph who took to England the Hebrew translation of the Kuzari which had been made by Judah Cardinal. Judah al-Ḥarizi met Joseph and his brother as heads of the new congregation of Jerusalem ("Taḥkemoni," xlvi.). Joseph is cited in the Tosafot as "Joseph of Jerusalem" (Pes. 15a), "Joseph, inhabitant of Jerusalem" (Meg. 4a), and "R. Joseph of Palestine" (Ḳid. 34a). Explanations of his are quoted by Bezaleel Ashkenazi in his "Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet," and in various commentaries on the Pentateuch. To Joseph of Clisson are attributed consultations ("Maimoniyyot,", No. 31) and divers ritual decisions (Mordecai on Ḥul. iii., No. 635; idem on Giṭ. iv., No. 465). Joseph was also the author of liturgical poems; a confession of sins for the Day of Atonement written by him, has been preserved in the ritual.
He is referred to as "Joseph" in a manuscript tosafist commentary to the Pentateuch belonging to E. N. Adler; but in the parallel passages in "Minḥat Yehudah," 21b, "Da'at Zeḳenim," 20b, and "Hadar Zeḳenim," 18a, he is cited as "the man of Jerusalem." Berliner ("Zeit. für Hebr. Bibl." iv. 148) identified him with Joseph ben Johanan the Jerusalemite (see Gross in "Monatsschrift," xlv. 370).

Other guests have included Annabel Karmel, Jane Fearnley Whittingstall (author of The Good Granny Cookbook), Sam Stern (the Teenage Chef), Nora Sands (Jamie’s School Dinner Lady)and children’s cookery writer Amanda Grant.
The idea for a food festival for children came to Eka Morgan, the Festival's Director, in 2005. "Parents say that one of the best ways to encourage children to eat good food is to get them to cook it themselves. I thought that a festival which conveyed positive messages about food, with plenty of colour, humour and hands-on cooking, could go some way to transform young people’s approach to eating."

(1967). Wicked problems. Management Science, 14(4), B-141 and B-142. but his influence on design theory and practice was much wider.Rith, C and Dubberly, H, 'Why Horst W J Rittel Matters', Design Issues, Vol 23, No 1, pp. 72-91
His field of work is the Science of Design, or, as it also known, the area of Design Theories and Methods (DTM), with the understanding that activities like planning, engineering, policy making are included as particular forms of design.
In response to the perceived failures of early attempts at systematic design, he introduced the concept of 'second generation design methods'Rittel, H., 1984, "Second-Generation Design Methods", in "Developments in Design Methodology", N. Cross (Editor), John Wiley & Sons, UK pp. 317-327. and a planning/design method known as Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) for handling wicked problems.

The manor-house in Radola is one of the oldest historical monuments in Kysuce, Slovakia. Historical research suggests that the oldest part of the building dates to between 1550 and 1575. In the second half of the 17th century, the building was reconstructed, probably as part of the major development of Kysuce; the manor house was now at the center of the town. At that time the manor house was a part of the budatin lordship owned by Suchonovi, whose descendants owned it until 1798, when the budatin lordship passed into the ownership of the Csaky family. The well preserved manor house in Radola represents a renessaince type of yeoman's habitation and initially it was apparently fortified by a castle wall.

In mathematical physics, the Lemaître–Tolman metric is the spherically symmetric dust solution of Einstein's field equations was first found by Lemaître in 1933 and then Tolman in 1934.  It was later investigated by Bondi in 1947.  This solution describes a spherical cloud of dust (finite or infinite) that is expanding or collapsing under gravity.  It is also known as the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi metric and the Tolman metric.
The metric is:
where:
The matter is comoving, which means its 4-velocity is:
The pressure is zero (hence dust), the density is 
and the evolution equation is
where
which are known as hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic evolutions respectively.
Special cases are the Schwarzschild metric in geodesic coordinates

Colorado earned the wild card after winning a one-game playoff with San Diego. Although the division winner with the best record normally plays the wild card team, the Diamondbacks played the Cubs, rather than the wild card Rockies, because the league does not pair teams from the same division against each other in the division series.
Both series represented the first time the opponents had met in the postseason, and the Rockies' victory was their first in any postseason series. The Diamondbacks and the Rockies met in the NL Championship Series, with the Rockies becoming the National League champion and going on to face the American League champion in the 2007 World Series.  This was the first time under the expanded playoffs format first used in 1995 that two teams from the National League's Western Division had played against one another in the NLCS.

[[Walter Behlen]]
CATEGORIES: American manufacturing businesspeople, People from Columbus, Nebraska, 1905 births, 1994 deaths

Walter Dietrich Behlen (October 16, 1905 – July 26, 1994) was born  on a small farm near Columbus, Nebraska. He was the second of nine children born to Fred and Ella Behlen. His high school education was interrupted by illness, but he returned to school at age 20, and received his diploma at age 23. He married Ruby Cumming in 1940; the couple had two children.
Behlen began his industrial career and the Behlen Manufacturing Company as a one-man operation in 1936. While working as a railway express man, he began producing steel toe caps for wooden-soled industrial shoes using various hand tools, a grinder poured from scrap metal, and a homemade forge he had installed in his garage workshop. During this time he also invented a lid clamp for wooden egg cases, which became "the first of a long line of products completely designed and fabricated in our factory." This part-time operation continued until 1941 when Walter and his father, Fred, began manufacturing small products as a full-time occupation. They were joined by Walter's brothers, H.P. "Mike" Behlen and G.E. "Gib" Behlen in 1946. The 1946 product line included the Behlen corn crib, portable farm grain dryers, and grain tanks.
The Behlen Manufacturing Company's best-known product was the frameless steel building system that it developed in 1950. This system employed deeply corrugated steel panels, which could be assembled to form a complete load-bearing shell without any supporting frame. In 1955, a Behlen building survived an atomic blast test at Operation Cue in the Nevada desert. This building was put on display at the 1955 Nebraska State Fair. Behlen buildings can be found all over the United States, as well as in many foreign countries. Behlen's [tpl]convert|19|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] facility in Columbus employed some 1100 people at its height. A nationwide network of five hundred builders marketed the company's product.
In 1969, Behlen Manufacturing Company became a subsidiary of the Wickes Corporation of Saginaw, Michigan. This arrangement continued until 1984, when the local management bought the company through a leveraged buyout. The company continued to be locally owned.
Among the awards and honors he received over many years of business and civic service, Behlen earned the Horatio Alger Award in 1968, the first Nebraskan to be so honored. He was granted honorary doctorates from the University of Nebraska, Midland College, and Doane College. Walter Behlen died on July 26, 1994.

[[Joseph ben Samuel Bonfils]]

CATEGORIES: 11th-century rabbis, People from Narbonne, French Orthodox rabbis

Joseph ben Samuel Bonfils (lived in the middle of the eleventh century) was a French rabbi, Talmudist, Bible commentator, and payyeṭan.  Of his life nothing is known but that he came from Narbonne, and was rabbi of Limoges in the province of Anjou.See Jacob Tam's "Sefer ha-Yashar," ed. Rosenthal, p. 90, and ed. Vienna, p. 74b; the passage is badly corrupted.
The activity of Bonfils was many-sided. A number of his decisions which earned the high esteem of his contemporaries and of posterity are to be found in the "Mordecai." These passages are enumerated in Kohn's Mordecai ben Hillel, p. 137; in Maḥzor Vitry, and in many other codices and compendiums. Among his numerous legal decisions one deserving mention is that pronouncing money won in play an illegal possession, and compelling the winner to return it ("Haggahot Mordecai," upon Sanh. pp. 722, 723). Another important decision ordered a lighter tax on the Jewish farmer than on the merchant, for the reason that agriculture was less profitable than trade ("Mordecai," B. B. i. 481). Little is known of the collections of his responsa mentioned in Moses Alashkar's Responsa (ed. Sabbionetta, No. 60, p. 121a; No. 100, p. 162a), or of his collection of the responsa of the Geonim. His Bible commentaries, mentioned by some of the old writers, have also disappeared.
Bonfils devoted himself to restoring the correct texts of older works, especially the Masorah—works of the Geonim. His critical notes upon Judah's Halakot Gedolot and the Seder Tannaim we-Amoraim show marked departures from the current text.
The ability and activity of Bonfils are best judged from his contributions to the poetry of the synagogue, no less than sixty-two of his piyyuṭim occupying prominent places in the French, German, and Polish liturgies. These compositions show that he was more than an ordinary poet (Leopold Zunz) among the Franco-German payyeṭanim of his time. Few equaled him in beauty of imagery and facility of expression. The poetry of the synagogue is furthermore deeply indebted to Bonfils for the introduction of the piyyuṭim into the prayers, in face of great opposition. Of his many piyyuṭim, the best-known is that written for the "Great Sabbath" (Sabbath before Passover), beginning with the words "Elohei ha-ruḥot," and containing the rules for the Passover-cleaning ("bi'ur") and the narrative service for the evening. 
The importance of Bonfils is shown by the fact that the Tosafists in many places occupy themselves with the explanation of obscure points in this piyyuṭ. Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise, a French Tosafist, composed a commentary upon it.
Joseph Bonfils must not be confused, as he is by Azulai, with another scholar of the same name, who lived in 1200 and corresponded with Simḥah of Speyer (Responsa of Meïr ben Baruch of Rothenburg. ed. Cremona, No. 148).

[[Brickendon]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in Hertfordshire, Civil parishes in Hertfordshire

Brickendon is a village in the civil parish of Brickendon Liberty in the district of East Hertfordshire about [tpl]convert|3|mi[/tpl] south of the county town Hertford, and is served by Bayford railway station.
Centred on a traditional village green and a friendly village pub, The Farmer's Boy, there is an active community with several clubs and activities. The parish (rather than just the village) has won several awards in the Hertfordshire Village of the Year contest in recent years.
The name is said to have come from a Saxon by the name of Bricca who laid claim to the hill site, the Saxon word 'don' meaning a hill; thus Bricca's Hill. In the Domesday Book the name appears as Brichendone. The manor of Brickendon was held by the canons and later the monks of Waltham Abbey (abbey), Essex, from about 1060 until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry II created the liberty of Brickendon - see Liberty (division) - in about 1174/84 which granted the abbot freedom from certain taxes normally due to the crown.
The chapel, dedicated to the Holy Cross and St Alban, was built in 1932 on land and with funds donated by Constance Demain Saunders and her mother Minnie Kingsley. It is part of the ecclesiastical parish of Bayford within the Hartford Hundred West group of parishes.
Brickendon Grange was built by Benjamin Cherry in 1859 and is now a golf club designed by CK Cotton. Fanshaws mansion, built in 1885 by Henry Wilson Demain Saunders, is now the headquarters of the Institute of the Motor Industry.
The former manor house at Brickendonbury was used as a spy training centre during World War II as Station XVII of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and is now home to the Tan Abdul Razak Research Centre of the Malaysian Rubber Board.

[[Selling Blue Elephants]]
CATEGORIES: Business books, 2007 books

Selling Blue Elephants: How to Make Great Products That People Want Before They Even Know They Want Them is a book written by Howard Moskowitz and Alex Gofman (Publisher: Wharton School Publishing 2007).
The book outlines a new solution-oriented learning experience co-developed with Prof. Jerry (Yoram) Wind of Wharton School of Business - Rule Developing Experimentation (RDE).
RDE is the systematized process of designing, testing and modifying alternative ideas, packages, products, or services in a disciplined way so that the developer and marketer discover what appeals to the customer, even if the customer can't articulate the need, much less the solution. The book describes best practices in the RDE from some of today's top companies: HP, Prego, Vlasic, MasterCard and others. Filled with real-life stories, this book changes the way people think about selling to their present and future customers.
The book was positively reviewed by Kirkus Reviews, Wharton Connect along with many others. Among distinguished people that endorsed the book are Prof. Stephen Kosslyn (Chair, Department of Psychology, Harvard University), Prof. Lawrence E. Marks (Professor of Epidemiology and Psychology, Director, John B. Pierce Laboratory, Yale University),  Prof. Eugene Galanter (Director, Psychophysics Laboratory, Columbia University), Prof. Subrata Sen (Yale University), Prof. Vijay Mahajan (John P. Harbin Centennial Chair in Business, Marketing Department, The University of Texas at Austin), Iain Bitran (President, The International Society for Professional Innovation Management - ISPIM) and others.

[[Adaptor hypothesis]]
CATEGORIES: Molecular biology

The adaptor hypothesis is part of a scheme to explain how information encoded in DNA is used to specify the amino acid sequence of proteins. It was formulated by Francis Crick in the mid-1950s, together with the central dogma of molecular biology and the sequence hypothesis. It first appeared in an informal publication of the RNA Tie Club in 1955 and was formally published in an article  “On Protein Synthesis” in 1958.
The adaptor hypothesis was framed to explain how information could be extracted from a nucleic acid and used to put together a string of amino acids in a specific sequence, that sequence being determined by the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) template. He proposed that each amino acid is first attached to its own specific “adaptor” piece of nucleic acid (in an enzyme catalysed reaction). The order of assembly of the amino acids is then determined by a specific recognition between the adaptor and the  nucleic acid which is serving as the informational template. In this way the amino acids could be lined up by the template in a specific order. Coupling between adjacent amino acids would then lead to the synthesis of a polypeptide whose sequence is determined by the template nucleic acid.
Crick’s  thinking behind this proposal was based on a general consideration of the chemical properties of the two classes of molecule — nucleic acids and proteins. The amino acids are characterised by having a variety of side chains which vary from being hydrophilic to hydrophobic: their individual characters reside in the very different properties these side chains have. By contrast, a nucleic acid is composed of a string of nucleotides whose sequence presents a geometrically defined surface for hydrogen bonding. This makes nucleic acids good at recognising each other, but poor at distinguishing the varied side chains of amino acids. It was this apparent lack of any possibility of specific recognition of amino acid side chains by a nucleotide sequence which led Crick to conclude that amino acids would first become attached to a small nucleic acid — the adaptor — and that this, by base-pairing with the template (presumably as occurs between DNA strands in the double helix), would carry the amino acids to be lined up on the template.
That such adaptors do exist was discovered by Mahlon Hoagland and Paul Zamecnik in 1958. These “soluble RNAs” are now called transfer RNAs and mediate the translation of messenger RNAs on ribosomes according to the rules contained in the genetic code. Crick imagined that his adaptors would be small, perhaps 5-10 nucleotides long. In fact, they are much larger, having a more complex role to play in protein synthesis, and are closer to 100 nucleotides in length.

William Salterlee Griffiths (26 June 1922 – 27 October 2010) was a British field hockey player who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics. He was a member of the British field hockey team, which won the silver medal. He played all five matches as forward.
Griffiths was President of Abergavenny Hockey Club from 1967 to 2007, for 40 of the club’s 110 years existence. He was about 14 years of age when he started to play hockey. He was to represent Great Britain on 8 occasions and was the holder of an Olympic silver medal that he won at the 1948 London Olympic Games when Great Britain came second to gold medallists India in the final. He played in all the matches of that campaign. His GB caps were awarded against Switzerland, the United States, Pakistan, India, Holland (twice), France, and Afghanistan.
Whilst a student at Cambridge University Griffiths was awarded a hockey blue. When World War II came he joined the Royal Air Force and was posted to South Africa where he continued to play hockey and became a PT instructor. On returning to Wales and to Cardiff University to complete his medical studies he played hockey for Newport Athletic and joined Abergavenny in 1950.
By then Griffiths had already accumulated 10 Welsh international caps, the first of which was in 1947 against Ireland. In total he played 32 times for Wales and ended his international career in 1956 when he travelled to Amsterdam to play Holland. Two of those 32 international games were played at Abergavenny Cricket Club – against England in 1949 and Ireland in 1954.
Griffiths was a forward thinking player in his heyday. At the 1948 Olympic Games all teams except India played with broad English head sticks. India used short rounded head sticks similar to those that we use today. Griffiths tried to convince players that the Indian head was the only way forward but to no avail. The English head was still being used in the 1952 Olympics.
Griffith’s specialty was the reverse stick cross from the left wing, which was reasonably easy to achieve with an Indian head stick but difficult with the cumbersome English head.
The club celebrated Bill’s 40 years of Presidency on 21 November 2007 and the incoming President, Trevor Scott thanked Bill for his unfailing interest and support during all of that time: “We have been very, very fortunate to have had such a distinguished sportsman and gentleman to be our President. It will be a hard act to follow.”
Chairman Paul Harrington, President Trevor Scott and current player Michael Potts made the presentation of an engraved sundial to Griffiths. Potts is Bill’s Grandson, following the family tradition.

He was born in Piombino, the son of Iacopo III Appiani, of whom he continued the traditional alliance with the Aragonese court of Naples. He was captain of the Neapolitan Army (1479–1483), of the Este army (1483–1485) and of the army of the Republics of Siena (1495–1498) and Florence (1498–1501). Later he served the king of France and Ferdinand II of Aragon.
In 1501 his territories in southern Tuscany were occupied by Cesare Borgia, but Iacopo could return in 1503 after the death of Borgia's power protector and father, Pope Alexander VI. In this period he received Leonardo da Vinci in his court. In 1509 he was made Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.
He died at Piombino in 1510.

CATEGORIES: 1996 books, Books about China, English-language books

Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now is a 1996 book by Chinese-Canadian journalist Jan Wong.  Wong describes how the youthful passion for left-wing and socialist politics drew her to participate in the Chinese Cultural Revolution.  Speaking little Chinese, she became one of the first Westerners to enroll in Beijing University in 1972.
However, her idealism did not survive the harsh realities and hypocrisy she saw in the China of the 1970s, and she abandoned her support of Maoism.  She eventually worked as a foreign correspondent for the Canadian Globe and Mail newspaper.
Wong was an eyewitness to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, which the book describes in great detail.  After the Tiananmen Square massacre, Wong interviewed Chinese dissidents such as Wei Jingsheng and Ding Zilin.
Jan also recalls memories of Madame Mao and the Gang Four as they were imprisoned after Mao Zedong died.

In 1978, in the face of civil war, the Guatemalan government proceeded with its economic development program, including the construction of the Chixoy hydroelectric dam. Financed in large part by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, the Chixoy Dam was built in Rabinal, a region of the department of Baja Verapaz  historically populated by the Maya Achi.  To complete construction, the government completed voluntary and forcible relocations of dam-affected communities from the fertile agricultural valleys to the much harsher surrounding highlands.  When hundreds of residents refused to relocate, or returned after finding the conditions of resettlement villages were not what the government had promised, these men, women, and children were kidnapped, raped, and massacred by paramilitary and military officials.  More than 440 Maya Achi were killed in the village of Río Negro alone, and the string of extrajudicial killings that claimed up to 5,000 lives between 1980 and 1982 became known as the Río Negro Massacres.  The government officially declared the acts to be counterinsurgency activities - although local church workers, journalists and the survivors of Rio Negro deny that the town ever saw any organized guerrilla activity.Environment News Service via NISGUAInternational Rivers Network/Witness for Peace, press release, Thursday 9 May 1996

Distancing is the appropriate selection of distance between oneself and a combatant throughout an encounter. Distancing is significant in an altercation as it determines both attack and defence options for all parties involved.Distancing (Combat Ranges) Timing and tactics are also important elements of combat which are often used in conjunction with distancing by experienced martial artists.8 ranges of combat, maai, irimi, closing the gap
Distancing is an important concept in all combative sports and arts. It applies to both un-armed and armed combat. In a martial sense, armed combat takes the form of traditional weapons practice. Given the enormous variety of martial arts weapons in addition to the various ranges of un-armed combat, it is possible to divide distancing up into many sub-distances or ranges. Indeed, many martial arts have their own uniques expressions for various distances or ranges derived from those they specialise in.
Distances may be divided up in a number of ways which include various combinations of major and sub-ranges. Although many styles train practitioners at varying ranges, most styles specialise in one or two major sets of ranges.
In a general, most arts describe each of the following ranges (from longest to shortest):
In addition, a great may sub-ranges may be included. One example is the division of the punching range into:
All other ranges may also be subdivided in a similar manner.
Many martial arts focus on specific distances. Examples of this are as follows:

Aleksander Ossypovich Zederbaum (born in Zamość, August 27, 1816; died in Saint Petersburg, September 8, 1893) was a Polish-Russian Jewish journalist. He was founder and editor of Ha-Meliẓ, and other periodicals published in Russian and Yiddish; he wrote in Hebrew. 
A son of poor parents, he was apprenticed to a tailor. He succeeded in acquiring a knowledge of Hebrew literature, and of the Russian, Polish, and German languages. He married in Lublin, and in 1840 left for Odessa, then the Mecca of the Haskalah movement. He obtained there a commercial position, made the acquaintance of the Maskilim of the city, and in his leisure hours continued to work for his self-education. Later he opened a clothing-store, and was himself cutter in his tailoring-shop.
In 1860 Zederbaum succeeded in obtaining the government's permission to publish "Ha-Meliẓ," the first Hebrew periodical issued in Russia; and three years later he began publishing the pioneer Yiddish journal "Ḳol Mebasser." After an existence of eight years the latter paper was suppressed by the government, whereupon Zederbaum went to Saint Petersburg, obtaining permission to transfer the headquarters of "Ha-Meliẓ" to that city. He was also granted permission to do his own printing, and to publish, besides "Ha-Meliẓ," a Russian weekly ("Vyestnik Ruskich Yedreed"), which, however, enjoyed only a short existence, as did also the "Razsvyet," which he started a few years later. In 1881 he founded the "Volksblatt," a daily Yiddish journal which existed for eight years, although Zederbaum was its editor for only a few years.
Zederbaum was the author of "Keter Kehunnah" and "Ben ha-Meẓarim," but neither of these works met with any success. His chief significance lies in the fact that he was a champion of the Haskalah. His Yiddish periodical "Ḳol Mebasser" offered an opportunity for many of the best jargon-writers to develop their talents; and among these may be mentioned Linetzky, Abramowitch, Spector, and Sholem Aleichem.
Zederbaum exercised considerable influence in government circles, and it was due to his intercession that an impartial judgment was obtained for many Jewish families accused of ritual murder in Kutais; he disclosed also the ignorance of the Russian anti-Semite Lutostansky, whose pamphlets threatened to become dangerous for the Russian Jews. The Palestine Association of Odessa owed its existence to Zederbaum's activity.

The Battle of Muar was the last major battle of the Malayan campaign. It took place from 14–22 January 1942 around Gemensah Bridge and on the Muar River. After the British defeat at Slim River, General Archibald Wavell, commander of ABDA, decided that Lieutenant General Lewis Heath's III Indian Corps should withdraw 150 miles south into the State of Johore to rest and regroup, whilst the 8th Australian Division would attempt to stop the Japanese advance.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PFJe2rRXwM
Allied soldiers, under the command of Major General Gordon Bennett, inflicted severe losses on Japanese forces at the Gemensah Bridge ambush and in a second battle a few miles north of the town of Gemas. Members of the Australian 8th Division killed an estimated 700 personnel from the Japanese Imperial Guards Division, in the ambush at the bridge itself, whilst Australian anti-tank guns destroyed several Japanese tanks in the battle north of Gemas.
Although the ambush was successful for the Allies, the defence of Muar and Bakri on the west coast was a complete failure which resulted in the near-annihilation of the 45th Indian Infantry Brigade and heavy casualties for its two attached Australian infantry battalions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/20/chapters/11.pdf|title=The Battle of Muar|publisher=AWM|accessdate=2009-03-30[/tpl] This was the first engagement between units of the British 18th Division and Japanese forces in Malaya.

[[Deep cycle battery]]
CATEGORIES: Battery types, Energy storage

A deep-cycle battery is a lead-acid battery designed to be regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity. In contrast, starter batteries (e.g. most automotive batteries) are designed to deliver short, high-current bursts for cranking the engine, thus frequently discharging only a small part of their capacity. While a deep-cycle battery can be used as a starting battery, the lower "cranking amps" imply that an oversized battery may be required.
A deep-cycle battery is designed to discharge between 45% and 75% of its capacity, depending on the manufacturer and the construction of the battery. Although these batteries can be cycled down to 20% charge, the best lifespan vs cost method is to keep the average cycle at about 45% discharge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.windsun.com/Batteries/Battery_FAQ.htm |title=Deep Cycle Battery FAQ |publisher=Windsun.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20[/tpl] There is a direct correlation between the depth of discharge of the battery, and the number of charge and discharge cycles it can perform.http://www.bdbatteries.com/images/lifelinelifecycles.jpg

The Exercicio quotidiano (older Spanish for "daily exercise"; modern spelling Ejercicio cotidiano; [tpl]IPA-es|exerˈθiθjo kotiˈðjano[/tpl]) is a Nahuatl-language Christian religious manuscript, consisting of daily meditations with Latin passages taken from the New Testament.
The manuscript was originally composed in 1574, and is attributed to the Franciscan missionary Bernardino de Sahagún.

The Battle of Canal du Nord was part of a general Allied offensive against German positions on the Western Front during the Hundred Days Offensive of World War I. The battle took place in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France, along an incomplete portion of the Canal du Nord and on the outskirts of Cambrai between 27 September and 1 October 1918. To avoid the risk of having extensive German reserves massed against a single Allied attack, the assault along the Canal du Nord was undertaken as part of a number of closely sequenced Allied attacks at separate points along the Western Front. It began one day after the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, one day before an offensive in the Flanders region of Belgium and two days before the Battle of St. Quentin Canal.[tpl]sfn|Tucker|1996|pp=421–422[/tpl]
The assault position was directly along the inter-army boundary between the British First Army and Third Army. Both armies were tasked with continuing the advance started with the Battle of the Drocourt-Quéant Line, Battle of Havrincourt and Battle of Epehy. The British First Army was operating in a framework whereby its main task was to lead the crossing of the Canal du Nord and secure the northern flank of the British Third Army as both advanced towards Cambrai. The British Third Army was additionally tasked with securing the Escaut (Scheldt) Canal so as to be in a position to support the British Fourth Army during the Battle of St. Quentin Canal.

CATEGORIES: Panorama software, Graphics software, Panorama viewers

HD View is an image viewer to aid in the display of very large images. Advances in  techniques for stitching digital images together has led to the creation of images of gigapixel size. Many of these images are panoramic or in full 360 degree fields of view. Since monitors are capable of displaying only a few million pixels at once, only a small portion of a gigapixel image can be viewed at any time. Also, images with wide fields of view are distorted to be saved as 2D files, causing viewing distortions.
Developed by Microsoft Research's Interactive Visual Media group, HD View uses current graphics hardware to provide smooth panning and zooming of images and to handle the transformation of a panoramic image back into the appearance of a natural 3D illusion. A viewer can also zoom into surprising details in an image or zoom out to view the entire 2D panoramic image.
HD View is available as an ActiveX browser component, making it only available to users with Microsoft Windows. Versions are available for the Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers.
Content for viewing can be created by the public and distributed on the web.

[[Forest transition]]
CATEGORIES: Forestry and sustainability

Forest transition refers to a geographic theory describing a reversal or turnaround in land-use trends for a given territory from a period of net forest area loss (i.e., deforestation) to a period of net forest area gain.Mather, A.S. 1992. The forest transition. Area 24(4): 367-379Walker, R. 1993.  Deforestation and Economic Development. Canadian Journal of Regional Science 16(3): 481-497.Grainger, Alan. 1995.

The scale of forest transition: Amazonia and the Atlantic forests of Brazil. Applied Geography'' 32(1): 12-20  
Forest recovery resulting in net increases in forest extent can occur by means of spontaneous regeneration, active planting, or both.Rudel, Thomas K., Oliver T. Coomes, Emilio Moran, Frederic Achard, Arild Angelsen, Jianchu Xu, and Eric Lambin. 2005. Forest transitions: towards a global understanding of the land use change. Global Environmental Change. 15: 23-31 
Forest transitions are associated with socio-economic transformations towards increased industrialization and urbanization. Other conditions leading to the abandonment of agricultural land (e.g., war and environmental legislation) have been found to play important roles in some cases. The different processes through which forest transitions occur are contingent upon the local socioeconomic and ecological contexts. Although some generic processes can be identified, countries do not necessarily experience a regular pattern of forest cover changes with time or development, and the causes and outcomes of forest transitions vary.
Studies of forest transitions have been conducted for several nations as well as sub-national regions. Territories reported to have experienced forest transitions after the onset of industrialization include Bangladesh, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark,Mather, A.S., C.L. Needle, and J.R. Coull. 1998.

Deforestation, forest transitions, and institutions for sustainability in southeastern Mexico, 1900-2000. Environment and History 11(2): 195–223 
The environmental effects of these forest transitions are very variable, depending on whether deforestation of old-growth forests continue, the proportions and types of tree plantations versus natural regeneration of forests, and the location and spatial configuration of the different types of forests.
The findings of returning forests in these widespread studies raise questions about the prospects of a worldwide forest transition, particularly given ongoing processes of forest loss in many parts of the world.Kauppi, Pekka E., Jesse H. Ausubel, Jingyun Fang, Alexander S. Mather, Roger A. Sedjo, and Paul E. Waggoner. 2006. Returning forests analyzed with the forest identity. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 103(46): 17574–17579 
In other words, can the global extent of forests be expected to reach a turning point in the future, reversing the current trend of overall forest decline towards overall forest expansion?
Studies showed that given an increased competition for productive land between different land uses, a global forest transition would require major policy and technological innovations as well as shifts
in demands for ﬁber, fuel, and food, and that these changes cannot be taken for granted.

[[Snoozer Quinn]]
CATEGORIES: American jazz guitarists, Jazz musicians from New Orleans, Louisiana, Dixieland guitarists, Dixieland violinists, Dixieland banjoists, American mandolinists, People from McComb, Mississippi, People from Bogalusa, Louisiana, 1907 births, Deaths from tuberculosis, 1949 deaths, Infectious disease deaths in Louisiana

Ed "Snoozer" Quinn (1907 – 1949) was a jazz guitarist very highly regarded by his fellow musicians, but who left few recordings.
Quinn was born Edward  McIntosh Quinn in Pike County, Mississippi in 1907. He and his family moved to Bogalusa, Louisiana when he was a toddler. In his teens and early twenties he was a member of the Paul English Traveling Shows, Mart Britt's Sylvan Beach Orchestra and Peck Kelley's band, Peck's Bad Boys. For a brief period Snoozer also led the Louisiana Ramblers. Documentation shows he performed in and around Galveston, Texas and San Antonio, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana. In the mid-1920s he made a series of radio broadcasts as a banjo virtuoso.
Perhaps most notably, Snoozer joined the Paul Whiteman Orchestra after Whiteman heard him backstage at the St. Charles Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 28, 1928. Snoozer was in New York City for a brief period of time, approximately from January-March 1929.
Quinn had a series of recording sessions in the 1920s, including solos and records with Bix Beiderbecke and Frankie Trumbauer, that were inexplicably lost and never issued.  His only commercially issued sides in this era are some with the Whiteman's full orchestra, where he is mostly inaudible, and a few rare cuts backing singers Bee Palmer and possibly Bing Crosby. In 1931, Quinn recorded some accompaniments for country singer Jimmie Davis.
Quinn contracted tuberculosis.  In 1948, musician and educator Johnny Wiggs brought a home recording machine and some blank discs to the tuberculosis ward of Charity Hospital, New Orleans  where Quinn was bedridden and persuaded Quinn to record.  These amateur recordings were later issued and are Quinn's best known. 
Quinn died on April 21, 1949 at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. He is buried in Ponemah Cemetery in Bogalusa, Louisiana.
(Details of Quinn's life have been obscure. His death date is listed as 1952 in many places, but this is incorrect. Also, he is listed in many places as being born in 1906 but according to his passport and death certificate, he was born in 1907. 1910 census records from Pike County indicate Quinn was about three years old in 1910. Official birth certificates were not kept in Mississippi until beginning in 1912.)

[[Elsa Eschelsson]]
CATEGORIES: Swedish scholars and academics, 1861 births, 1911 deaths, People from Norrköping, 19th-century Swedish people, Suicides in Sweden

Elsa Olava Kristina Eschelsson (11 November 1861--10 March 1911) was the first woman to finish a Doctor of Laws (juris utriusque doctor) degree and the first to attain the academic position of docent at a Swedish university, but was denied the right to even serve as acting professor because of her sex. She died from an overdose of sleeping-powder in 1911. 
Elsa Eschelsson was born in Norrköping. As most of the earliest generation of women to study at Swedish universities,See Rönnholm p. 46-49 she came from a well-to-do bourgeois background, daughter of Anders Olof Eschelsson, the owner of a soap factory who also served as Prussian consul in Norrköping. Elsa's mother Carolina Lovisa Ulrika Frestadius was her husband's cousin and daughter of a prominent Stockholm industrialist, A. W. Frestadius.Anon., "Eschelsson, släkt", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, Vol. 14 p. 513. 
After his wife's death, A. O. Eschelsson settled in Stockholm with his four daughters. At the age of fourteen Elsa lost her father as well and moved in with an older sister, the young dowager countess Anna Piper. Her oldest sister, Ida, was married to Johan Vilhelm Hagströmer, a law professor at Uppsala university. Elsa finished her "studentexamen", the final examination from secondary school, in 1882 and came to Uppsala as a student. She began with a fil. kand. degree in history which she completed in 1885. After graduating, she went on a long journey through Europe and the Middle East, but returned to Uppsala and her studies in the fall. She had shown an early interest in studying Law and after her return she began her law studies, encouraged by her brother-in-law Hagströmer. She received her juris utriusque licentiat and juris utriusque doctor degrees in 1897 and was appointed a docent of civil law at the university. 
Eschelsson lectured in process law at the university 1897-1899, taught the so-called propaedeutic course in civil law from 1904 and held appointment to examine students taking the civilexamen (a lower law degree qualifying for some civil servant positions). As a woman pioneer in her field, she had supporters in the Faculty of Law, including Ernst Trygger and her brother-in-law Hagströmer, but also encountered problems; because of her sex, she would not have been allowed to hold an ordinary professorship - this was changed only in 1925 - and, despite the recommendation of the faculty, she was denied even acting as professor in 1898. She had the support of most of the professors in the Law Faculty but was brutally persecuted by civil law professor Alfred Ossian Winroth (1852-1914), who had come from Lund in 1899, until he moved to a professorship at the University in Stockholm in 1907. 
She has been describedMarkusson Winkvist, p. 118 both as shy and ambitious, and as a sensitive person with many highs and lows who kept a formal and distanced relationship to the other women at the university and avoided participating in many of their social activities. She died March 10, 1911, in Uppsala from an overdose of sleeping-powder in what has often been assumed to be suicide. In accordance with her wishes, her papers were destroyed after her death. In her will, she left 60,000 crowns to a scholarship fund for female law students. A memorial volume dedicated to her was published in 1929. In 1997, at the occasion of the 100th anniversary of her disputation for the Doctor of Laws degree, a volume of the yearbook De Lege, was published under the title Elsa Eschelsson: Ad studium et ad laborem incitavit, including a biographical study of Eschelsson by Gunilla Strömholm and other papers by female jurists at the Uppsala Faculty of Law. Since that year, the Faculty of Law has celebrated an "Elsa Eschelsson Day" with a symposium on gender issues every year on May 31.

In 2008 he composed the music for Stefan Komandarev's highly acclaimed film The World is Big and Salvation Lurks Around the Corner, a Bulgarian-German co-production with Miki Manojlovic in the lead role, which won a considerable number of international awards and reached the Short List of The Academy Awards 2010 for Foreign Language film.
Although Valdobrev continued performing in theatre (Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, Muller's Hamletmachine, Anouilh's Eurydice), he gradually moved away from this area, and also from the music stage, to become more established as a film actor. In 2004 he got his break in Burning out, for which he received the Golden Rose for Best Male performance at the National Film Awards.
In 2006-2007 Valdobrev completed a film directing specialization at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU). After graduating from there he directed a few short films, TV programs and music videos. He made his director's film debut in 2010 with the documentary comedy drama My Mate Manchester United. Provided with the cameo appearance of the Bulgarian football superstar Dimitar Berbatov, the film won two international awards and was presented in the competition of the official selection of 21 major world film festivals: IDFA Amsterdam, HotDocs Toronto, ZagrebDox, Sarajevo and Warsaw among them.[tpl]cite web|title=My Mate Manchester United - Home|url=http://www.mymatemanchesterunited.com/|website=My Mate Manchester United - Official Website|accessdate=7 July 2013[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Newspapers published in the Russian Empire, Hebrew-language newspapers, Haskalah, Media in Odessa, Media in Saint Petersburg

Ha-Melitz was the first Hebrew newspaper in Russia. It was founded by Alexander Zederbaum in Odessa in 1860. 
Ha-Melitz first appeared as a weekly. It began to appear daily in 1886. From 1871 it was published in St. Petersburg. Publication was suspended several times for lack of support or by order of the authorities. In 1893, Leon Rabinowitz succeeded Zederbaum as the editor. 
Ha-Melitẓ was a representative of the progressive or haskalah movement, and even so severe a critic as Kowner admitted that "it has been more useful to the Jews than have the other Hebrew newspapers" ("Ḥeḳer Dabar," pp. 52 et seq., Warsaw, 1866). While it not so literary or scientific as some of its contemporaries, it usually had more news and debatess of interest, and was consequently more popular.
J. A. Goldenblum was for many years associated with Zederbaum in its publication. A. S. Friedberg and Judah Leib Gordon were the best known of its associate editors. Almost every prominent Hebrew writer of its times contributed to it. 
Ḳohelet (St. Petersburg, 1881), Migdonot (1883), Melitẓ Aḥad Minni Elef (on the occasion of the appearance of No. 1,000; ib. 1884), Leḳeṭ Amarim (1889), and Arba'ah Ma'amarim (1893) are collections of literary and scientific articles which appeared as supplements to Ha-Melitẓ in Zederbaum's time. Ha-Yeḳev(ib. 1894), Ha-Osem and Ha-Gat (1897), and Ha-Gan (1899) are similar publications issued by Zederbaum's successor.
Ha-Meliz was intermittently published until 1903.

[[Conceptual physics]]
CATEGORIES: Physics education

Conceptual physics is a non-mathematical approach to teaching physics. It is believed that with a strong conceptual foundation in physics, students are better equipped to understand the equations and formulas of physics, and to make connections between the concepts of physics and their everyday world.
Paul G. Hewitt popularized this approach with his textbook Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment in 1971.[tpl]cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment|publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1971[/tpl] In his review at the time, Kenneth Ford noted the emphasis on logical reasoning and said "Hewitt's excellent book can be called physics without equations, or physics without computation, but not physics without mathematics."[tpl]cite journal|last=Ford|first=Kenneth W.|title=Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to Your Environment|journal=Physics Today|date=October 1971|volume=24|issue=10|pages=54–55|doi=10.1063/1.3022390[/tpl] Hewitt's wasn't the first book to take this approach. Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion by Jae R. Ballif and William E. Dibble was published in 1969.[tpl]cite book|last1=Ballif|first1=Jae R.|author2=William E. Dibble|title=Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zq7vAAAAMAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Wiley[/tpl] But Hewitt's book became very successful. It is currently in its eleventh edition.[tpl]cite book|last=Hewett|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics|year=2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-321-56809-0|edition=11th[/tpl] In 1987 Hewitt wrote a version for high school students.[tpl]cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics: The High School Physics Program|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-133-64749-5|edition=3rd[/tpl]
The spread of the conceptual approach to teaching physics broadened the range of students taking physics in high school.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hehn|first=Jack|coauthors=Michael Neuschatz|title=Physics For All? A Million and Counting!|journal=Physics Today|volume=59|issue=2|date=February 2006|pages=37–43|doi=10.1063/1.2186280|url=http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/million.pdf|bibcode = 2006PhT....59b..37H [/tpl]  Enrollment in conceptual physics courses in high school grew from 25,000 students in 1987 to over 400,000 in 2009. In 2009, 37% of students took high school physics, and 31% of them were in Physics First, conceptual physics courses, or regular physics courses using a conceptual textbook.[tpl]cite journal|last=White|first=Susan|coauthors=Casey Langer Tesfaye|title=High School Physics Courses and Enrollments|journal=Focus On|date=August 2010|url=http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/highschool3.pdf|publisher=American Institute of Physics Statistical Research Center[/tpl]
This approach to teaching physics has also inspired books for science literacy courses, such as From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness by Sadri Hassani.[tpl]cite book|last=Hassani|first=Sadri|title=From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oypZ_a9pqdsC|year=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-0849-8[/tpl]

[[Inhomogeneous cosmology]]
CATEGORIES: Physical cosmology

Inhomogeneous cosmology usually means the study of structure in the universe by means of exact solutions of Einstein's field equations (i.e. metrics) or by spatial or spacetime averaging methods. Such models are not homogeneous, but contain enough matter to be possible cosmological models, typically without dark energy, or models of cosmological structures such as voids or galaxy clusters. In contrast, perturbation theory, which deals with small perturbations from e.g. a homogeneous metric, only holds as long as the perturbations are not too large, and N-body simulations use Newtonian gravity which is only a good approximation when speeds are low and gravitational fields are weak.

(I want a world, where insects and worms are tasty again. I want a world, where I can drink out of the toilet without getting a rash.) are samples from the end of the German version of the film "The Naked Gun 2½".

[[DramaGods]]
CATEGORIES: American rock music groups

Dramagods (formerly known as Population 1) is a rock band led by Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt.
The band originally started when Bettencourt released the album Population 1 in 2002 (late 2001 in Japan). On the album, he recorded all the instruments on most of the tracks. When he decided to go on tour to support the album, he formed a touring band with Joe Pessia on rhythm guitar, Steve Ferlazzo on keyboards and back-up vocals, Philip Bynoe on bass and Kevin Figueiredo on drums. Later Phil left and Joe took the role of bassist. In 2004, while still under the moniker of Population 1, they released an EP titled Sessions from Room 4.
In 2005, due to legal issues, Bettencourt dropped the name Population 1 and changed it to Dramagods with the same lineup.
Dramagods released their debut effort Love in December 2005, available as an import via Victor Entertainment (Japan). The band then made their record available as a digital download on iTunes in early 2006.
The band toured in Japan, where they appeared at the Udo Music Festival along with KISS, Santana, Jeff Beck, The Doobie Brothers, Alice in Chains, The Pretenders, Ben Folds Five, and others in July 2006 shortly after Bettencourt took part in a three-date reunion tour with Extreme in New England.
In the autumn of 2006, DramaGods contributed their song "S'OK" to the album project Artists for Charity - Guitarists 4 the Kids, produced by Slang Productions to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need.[tpl]cite web|title=Slang Productions - Guitarists 4 the Kids|url=http://slangproductions.com/artists-for-charity-guitarists-4-the-kids.html|publisher=Slang Productions|accessdate=March 30, 2014|date=September 11, 2006[/tpl]
In early 2007 Dramagods started to dissolve when Nuno, Steve and Kevin became a part of Perry Farrell's musical venture Satellite Party which released one record (Ultra Payloaded). During the subsequent tour, they ended up quitting the band by July 2007 when Nuno and Gary Cherone reformed Extreme, making it a definitive reunion. Steve Ferlazzo went on to play with Avril Lavigne.

Flying Paster (1976–1992) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse bred in California by his owner, Bernard J. Ridder of the Knight Ridder newspaper chain. Named for a printing process mechanism, the colt was a grandson of the British and North American Champion Sire, Nasrullah, who in turn was the son of the great Nearco.
An outstanding racehorse, Flying Paster had the misfortune of being foaled in the same year as Spectacular Bid, a future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee and a horse that The Blood-Horse magazine would rate as America's 10th best horse of the 20th Century. Ridden by Don Pierce, in 1978 Flying Paster was the dominant two-year-old on the U.S. West Coast, winning six stakes races, usually with a powerful stretch drive. He became the first 2-year-old to be voted California Horse of the Year.
With Pierce in the saddle to start his three-year-old campaign, Flying Paster won February's San Vicente Stakes, was third in the March San Felipe Stakes, then captured the West Coast's most important race for three-year-olds, the Santa Anita Derby. Sent to the Kentucky Derby, Flying Paster was the second choice among bettors behind the heavily favored Spectacular Bid. However, the colt suffered a cut in his right foreleg during the race and finished fifth. After tying the Pimlico track record for the first quarter, Flying Paster finished a distant fourth in the Preakness Stakes. He did not run in the third and final leg of the Triple Crown series, the 1½ mile Belmont Stakes. Regaining his form, near the end of the 1979 racing season, Flying Paster came back with an important win in the Grade I Hollywood Derby.
Racing at age four, in 1980 Flying Paster finished second four times to Spectacular Bid including in the Grade I Santa Anita Handicap. Ridden by Chris McCarron in 1981, he started the year with wins in the San Pasqual and San Carlos Handicaps, then made it three in a row by capturing the San Antonio Handicap.
Retired to stud duty, Flying Paster sired 48 stakes winners and was California's leading sire for five consecutive years from 1987 through 1991. His progeny included Grade I winner Cats Cradle and the Jack Kent Cooke-owned California Champion, Flying Continental whose wins included the Jockey Club Gold Cup.
At the pinnacle of his breeding career, Flying Paster died unexpectedly at age sixteen from a heart attack on August 22, 1992 at Cardiff Stud Farm in Creston, California.

Ostasio III da Polenta (died 1447) was the last lord of Ravenna of the da Polenta family.
The son of Obizzo da Polenta, he inherited Ravenna but under the control of a proveditore from the nearby Republic of Venice. In 1438 the condottiero Niccolò Piccinino, commander of the Milanese troops, invaded the lordship, forcing Ostasio to ally himself with the Visconti of Milan against Venice. The latter sent a fleet which conquered Ravenna without opposition, putting an end to the Polentani seigniory in February 1441.
Ostasio was exiled to a Benedictine convent in Candia, in Crete, where he died in 1447, probably assassinated.

Obizzo da Polenta (died January 30, 1431) was a lord of Ravenna of the da Polenta family.
Obizzo and his brothers had their father Guido III da Polenta imprisoned in 1389. However, all his brothers died in sequence (probably assassinated by him) in the following years; when also Aldobrandino died in 1406, Obizzo managed to gain the undisputed power in Ravenna.
In 1404 he signed a treaty with the much stronger neighbour, the Republic of Venice, by which he received help against the Este of Ferrara, in exchange of help in the Venetian war against the Carraresi. Obizzo was imprisoned during the latter campaign, being freed after payment of 8,000 ducats. In 1406 he asked Venice to send a podestà in Ravenna as protection for him and his sons; in exchange, the Ravennate lands would go to Venice in the event of the childless death of a Polentani.
He died in 1431, succeeded by his son Ostasio under the Venetian regency. However, when Ostasio abandoned the alliance with Venice, the latter ousted him and annexed Ravenna.

Suppo II (also Suppo III in the familial genealogy) (Italian: Suppone) (died circa 879) was the Duke of Spoleto from 871 until his death. He was the archiminister (archminister) and consiliarius (counsellor) of the Emperor Louis II. In 869-870 he travelled to Constantinople as imperial missus together with Anastasius the Librarian, to negotiate a peace with the Byzantines. Throughout Louis's reign he was the most powerful lay magnate in Italy.
He was a  member of the Supponid family and was related to Louis's empress, Engelberga, and also to Suppo, count of Parma, Asti, and Turin, his cousin. After Louis's death, at first he supported Carloman of Bavaria for the Italian throne. After Charles the Bald obtained the crown, he pacified with him but in February 876 he was stripped of the duchy of Spoleto, in favour of the previous duke, Lambert I.
Suppo III died between March 877 (when he is mentioned in a document) and August 879 (when a letter from Pope John VIII laments his death.
Suppo's wife was a sister of Eberhard of Friuli and he had a son named Unroch, who in turn had a son named Rudolph.

[[Spinplasmonics]]

CATEGORIES: Spintronics, Condensed matter physics, Plasma physics

Spinplasmonics is a field of nanotechnology combining spintronics and plasmonics. The field was pioneered by Professor Abdulhakem Elezzabi at the University of Alberta in Canada. In a simple  spinplasmonic device, light waves couple to electron spin states in a metallic structure. The most elementary spinplasmonic device consists of a bilayer structure made from magnetic and nonmagnetic metals. It is the nanometer scale interface between such metals that gives rise to an electron spin phenomenon. The plasmonic current is generated by optical excitation and its properties are manipulated by applying a weak magnetic field. Electrons with a specific spin state can cross the interfacial barrier, but those with a different spin state are impeded. Essentially, switching operations are performed with the electrons spin and then sent out as a light signal.
Spinplasmonic devices potentially have the advantages of high speed, miniaturization, low power consumption, and multifunctionality. On a lengthscale that is less than a single magnetic domain size, the interaction between atomic spins realigns the magnetic moments. Unlike semiconductor-based devices, smaller spinplasmonics devices are expected to be more efficient in transporting the spin-polarized electron current.

[[Vandalic War]]
CATEGORIES: 533 in Africa, 534 in Africa, Vandalic War, Military history of Tunisia, Military history of Algeria, Military history of Libya, 6th century in Africa

The Vandalic War was a conflict fought in North Africa (largely in modern Tunisia) between the forces of the Eastern Roman ("Byzantine") Empire and the Vandalic Kingdom of Carthage, in 533–534. It was the first of Justinian I's wars of reconquest of the lost Western Roman Empire.
The Vandals had occupied Roman North Africa in the early 5th century, and established an independent kingdom there. Under their first king, Geiseric, the formidable Vandal navy carried out pirate attacks across the Mediterranean, sacked Rome and defeated a massive Roman invasion in 468. After Geiseric's death, relations with the surviving Eastern Roman Empire normalized, although tensions flared up occasionally due to the Vandals' militant adherence to Arianism and their persecution of the Chalcedonian native population. In 530, a palace coup in Carthage overthrew the pro-Roman Hilderic and replaced him with his cousin Gelimer. The Eastern Roman emperor Justinian took this as a pretext to interfere in Vandal affairs, and after he secured his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he began preparing an expedition under general Belisarius, whose secretary Procopius wrote the main historical narrative of the war. Justinian took advantage of, or even instigated, rebellions in the remote Vandal provinces of Sardinia and Tripolitania. These not only distracted Gelimer from the Emperor's preparations, but also weakened Vandal defences through the dispatch of the bulk of the Vandal navy and a large portion of their army under Gelimer's brother Tzazon to Sardinia. 
The Roman expeditionary force set sail from Constantinople in late June 533, and after a sea voyage along the coasts of Greece and southern Italy, landed on the African coast at Caputvada in early September, to Gelimer's complete surprise. The Vandal king gathered his forces and met the Roman army at the Battle of Ad Decimum, near Carthage, on 13 September. Gelimer's elaborate plan to encircle and destroy the Roman army came close to success, but Belisarius was able to drive the Vandal army to flight and occupy Carthage. Gelimer withdrew to Bulla Regia, where he gathered his remaining strength, including the army of Tzazon, which returned from Sardinia. In December, Gelimer advanced towards Carthage and met the Romans at the Battle of Tricamarum. The battle resulted in a Roman victory and the death of Tzazon. Gelimer fled to a remote mountain fortress, where he was blockaded until he surrendered in the spring.
Belisarius returned to Constantinople with the Vandals' royal treasure and the captive Gelimer to enjoy a triumph, while Africa was formally restored to imperial rule as the praetorian prefecture of Africa. Imperial control scarcely reached beyond the old Vandal kingdom, however, and the Moorish tribes of the interior proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion. The new province was shaken by the wars with the Moors and military rebellions, and it was not until 548 that peace was restored and Roman government firmly established.

[[Saint-Victoret]]
CATEGORIES: Communes of Bouches-du-Rhône

Saint-Victoret is a commune in the Bouches-du-Rhône department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in southern France. It is located northwest of Marseille.
Saint-Victoret is a small market town situated just next to Marignane, not far from the airport and just a few kilometres from the eastern shore of the Étang de Berre.
If you take the secondary road D20 to Saint-Victoret, you first pass through the hamlet of Pas-des-Lanciers. Here you will find a small, lively district with a few shops and an SNCF railway station for the transport of goods and freight to the airport. In the roads parallel to the D20 there are some pretty little villas which were built before the airport.
Two kilometres beyond Pas-des-Lanciers you will come to the centre of Saint Victoret. With its new housing blocks, roundabouts planted with flowers, a media library and a cultural centre, the heart of the village is well laid out and pleasantly floral. You may feel as though you have arrived in the new village of Saint Victoret, since everything looks so recent. Nevertheless, the village makes the most of what historic heritage there is, with several chapels, churches and pretty fountains.
The history and life of Saint-Victoret are closely linked with the activities of the airport in every respect. There is one Saint-Victoret before the airport and another after the airport ... the proximity of the airport has enormous repercussions for the village. First and foremost is obviously the incessant noise of aeroplanes landing at the airport. How bearable the noise is depends on which district of Saint-Victoret you are in (some districts lie directly beneath the flight path to the landing strip).
In terms of employment, real estate and, above all, the revival of the local economy, the airport has certainly had a very real impact on Saint-Victoret... both in a positive and a negative sense. In terms of tourism, large numbers of visitors see Saint Victoret... but only from the air!

Stephen Polito (also known as Stephano, Stephani and Stephanus Polito) (1763/4–1814) was a menagerie owner of Italian descent in Georgian England.
Polito was born in Italy.  He owned a menagerie which he toured around England in the late 18th century.  He went into partnership with another menagerist named Miles in 1798, and "Miles and Polito's Menagerie" exhibited at St Bartholomew's Fair in 1799.  Polito's menagerie also attended Nottingham Goose Fair in 1807.  
Polito acquired the permanent menagerie at Exeter Exchange in the Strand in London from the Pidcock family in 1810, and renamed it the Royal Menagerie.  He continued to tour in the summer, and exhibited his animals at Exeter Exchange in the winter.  The menagerie at Exeter Excahgne was very popular during Polito's short period of ownership.  It was visited by William Wordsworth and Lord Byron, and animals in his collection were painted by Edwin Landseer and Jacques-Laurent Agasse.  The menagerie lions, tigers, hyenas, zebras, kangaroos, and many other exotic animals, and the elephant Chunee, which was shot to death in 1826.
His collection was acquired by his brother, John, after his death, and then by a former employee, Edward Cross (also John's father in law).  Cross continued to tour under the name "Polito's Menagerie".  It is represented on pearlware pottery from the 1830s.

[[Tube riding]]
CATEGORIES: Surfing, Surfing terminology

Tube riding is a term used by surfers to describe riding well inside the curve or barrel of a finely-shaped breaking wave. Under the right conditions, waves in some areas form a moving "tube" or cylinder as they break, for example, see the Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii.   
The most straightforward way to tube ride is by body surfing.  A body surfer may ride the waves on his belly without a board and thus he can relatively easily access the tube, even on a moderately small wave that is barreling.  It is also possible to tube ride using a boogie board, a surfboard, and other wave riding tools. However, tube riding is an advanced skill, and many surfers spend years and even lifetimes surfing without ever really getting "tubed" — the term used for being inside the barrel of the wave.

[[Initiation of force]]
CATEGORIES: Violence, Concepts in ethics, War

The initiation of force is the start, or beginning, of the use of physical and/or legal coercion, violence, or restraint. This is to be distinguished from retaliatory force and violence. It can be understood as the difference between two or more individuals getting into a fist-fight: whoever "threw the first punch" is the initiator of force, or aggressor, while the person attacked — the victim — is using non-initiatory or retaliatory force if they fight back. Moral opposition to initiation of force is complementary with the non-aggression principle which supports force only in self-defense.
There are two main types of force-initiation: direct physical and legal. The initiation of legal force is the use of government or legal proceedings to indirectly coerce a non-aggressor. Direct physical force includes all kinds of physical violence and coercion; most ethical theorists extend it to include economic features, however, they disagree on what constitutes force in this respect. Progressives and left-liberals believe that exploitation and alienation constitute the use of force, while classical liberals (including libertarians), capitalists, and many Western conservatives insist that only acts of aggression, fraud, theft, trespassing, and vandalism are. Mutualists hold that enforcement of intellectual property rights and title for vacant, unimproved land constitute aggression since they view both as illegitimate property claims. Theocratic and moralistic religious extremists may believe it is possible for humans to initiate force against God(s) by sinning, and that it is thus mandated that other humans act on behalf of God(s) by using retaliatory force against the transgressor. To an impartial observer, the 'sinner' would be seen as being a non-aggressor that was physically attacked, and the 'punishers' would be the force-initiators.
Many theorists extend the definition to also cover all acts of deception, lying, misrepresentation, and verbal threats, but not all agree that this is indeed initiation of force in every case, or at all, as none of these things, in and of themselves, actually cause physical harm to a person. However, the near-automatic emotional reactions can lead to severe psychological harm, hence many in the general population perceive certain verbal insults and taunts as initiatory blows which warrant immediate physical retaliation. The highly subjective and arbitrary basis of what can constitute such responses as justifiable, along with the fact that again, no actual physical contact occurs, leaves most ethicists to concur that it is still only the person who throws the first punch who is in fact the force-initiator and that it is ultimately under the control of the target of such insults and taunts as to whether or not they are actually harmed; at any rate, it is their responsibility to control their physical reactions that directly (physically) affect others.
Some have argued that private property requires initiation of force since it allows owners to use force to exclude others from previous unowned land. Even if one thinks violating private property is immoral that doesn't make it a kind of force.

John was the Frankish Duke of Istria in the early years of the 9th century, soon after its conquest by Charlemagne. 
In 804, the denizens of the nine cities of Istria complained to Charlemagne that John was ignoring their ancient privileges. John had taken away the privileges of sea-fishing and pasturing in public forests. He had abolished the old hierarchy and either abolished the offices of tribune, domesticus, vicarius, and hypatus or filled them Franks. He seized lands and confiscated the taxes (344 solidi mancusi annually from the cities) for himself. He forced many to serve in the army personally, alongside their slaves, and to demand corvée labour. John explained that he had been ignorant of the customs of Istria and promised to make amends and ceased exacting corvées. It is unknown if he did.

Tetrahalomethanes are fully halogenated methane derivatives of general formula CBrkCllFmIn.
Tetrahalomethanes are on the border of inorganic and organic chemistry, thus they can be assigned both inorganic and organic names by IUPAC: tetrafluoromethane - carbon tetrafluoride, tetraiodomethane - carbon tetraiodide, dichlorodifluoromethane - carbon dichloride difluoride.
Each halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) forms corresponding halomethane, but their stability decreases in order CF4 > CH4 > CCl4 > CBr4 > CI4 from exceptionally stable gaseous tetrafluoromethane with bond energy 515 kJ.mol-1 to solid tetraiodomethane. It depends on bond energy.
Many mixed halomethanes are also known, such as CBrClF2.

[[Standpipe (street)]]
CATEGORIES: Water supply

A standpipe is a freestanding pipe fitted with a tap which is installed outdoors to dispense water in areas which do not have a running water supply to the buildings.
In the United Kingdom, an "Emergency Drought Order" permits a water company to shut off the primary water supply to homes, and to supply water instead from tanks or standpipes in the streets. This was done in some areas during the 1976 heat wave, for example.
In some Middle Eastern, Caribbean and North African countries a standpipe is used as a communal water supply for neighbourhoods which lack individual housing water service.  In areas such as Morocco, standpipes often yield unreliable service and lead to water scarcity for large numbers of people.Guillaume Benoit and Aline Comeau, A Sustainable Future for the Mediterranean (2005) 640 pages  This outcome is not based upon the unreliability of the hardware, but on the underlying condition of the population exceeding the carrying capacity of the region with respect to water resources.

[[Power gain]]
CATEGORIES: Electrical parameters, Two-port networks

The power gain of an electrical network is the ratio of an output power to an input power. Unlike other signal gains, such as voltage and current gain, "power gain" may be ambiguous as the meaning of terms "input power" and "output power" is not always clear. Three important power gains are operating power gain, transducer power gain and available power gain. Note that all these definitions of power gains employ the use of average (as oppose of instantaneous) power quantities and therefore the term "average" is often suppressed, which can be confusing at occasions.

[[Mount Carmel Clinic]]

CATEGORIES: Organizations based in Winnipeg, Jews and Judaism in Manitoba

Mount Carmel Clinic, a landmark in Winnipeg’s North End community was established by the Jewish community in 1926, to meet the needs of Jewish immigrants.   It is considered to be the first community health centre in Canada.  The cultural make-up of the Point Douglas and North End communities has changed in the eight decades that Mount Carmel Clinic has been in operation.  Today the clinic still serves vulnerable people to improve access of community members to healthcare, fulfilling its mission of working together for a healthy community.   
Anne Ross deserves special mention in discussing the growth of the Clinic.  She was a Winnipeg nurse, health administrator and social activist who dedicated her career to community health care.  Anne Ross started with the Mount Carmel Clinic in 1948 and served as its Director from 1964 – 1986.  During that time she built the Clinic up from a small walk-in facility to a major community health centre offering comprehensive health and community outreach services.  The Anne Ross Day Nursery, which she established in 1976, commemorates her legacy. 
The residents of the North End/Point Douglas community served by Mount Carmel Clinic are confronted on a daily basis with the profound impacts of poverty, which contribute to health status indicators significantly below the norms for Winnipeg.  Programs are focused on meeting the needs of members of this community, many of whom experience complex health and social concerns. 
The Jewish doctors that established the Clinic in 1926 did so out of a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to their community.  They had a vision that continues today.  In 2005-2006, there were more than 160,000 points of contact at the Clinic, including over 19,000 physician visits, 91,000 patient encounters with clinic nurses, 42,845 prescriptions filled, over 3,700 dental visits and over 1,200 cross cultural counseling sessions.  Other services at the Clinic include the Anne Ross Day Nursery with licensed and subsidized space for up to 45 children, the Children’s Day Hospital, teen clinics at neighbouring high schools, diabetes clinics, nutrition programs, midwife services, free computer services, first aid training, after school and summer sports programs for children, and individual and family counseling and special programs for the elderly.  
The Mount Carmel Clinic Foundation is a community fundraising organization that supports research, innovative programming, and capital development in order to enhance and broaden the programs and services of Mount Carmel Clinic.

The Tican's Rebellion ([tpl]lang-sr|Ticanova buna or Тицанова буна[/tpl]) was a rebellion of the Syrmian peasants against feudal relations in society. The rebellion started in April 1807 on the estate of Ruma of earl Karlo Pejačević (who was also the prefect of Syrmia county) and estate of Ilok of earl Odescalchi. The reason for the rebellion was large increase of feudal tributes and dissatisfaction because of land regulation.
Tican's Rebellion included 15,000 Serb peasants from 45 villages and the center of the rebellion was in the village of Voganj near Ruma. From this village, on April 3, the Syrmian rebels sent a proclamations about rebellion. The leaders of the rebellion were Teodor Avramović Voganjac (local knez - the head of the village), Andrija Popović (teacher), Pantelija Ostojić and Marko Ognjanović. However, the rebellion was named after Teodor Avramović Tican from village of Jazak, one of the leaders of the rebellion, who advocated uncompromised fight against sipahi (feudal lords) and church oligarchy.
The rebellion was suppressed on April 9 near Bingula, but its final end was on April 14. The Austrian authorities used troops strong almost as an army to fight against the rebels. The Orthodox priests led by metropolitan Stefan Stratimirović also helped in suppression of the rebellion. After the rebellion was suppressed, the amnesty was proclaimed for most rebels except for Tican, who was sentenced to death by torture on the wheel.
However, because of the Napoleonic Wars and war between Serbs and Ottomans in Karađorđe's Serbia, the Austrian authorities were forced to be lenient towards peasant rebels in Syrmia and Slavonia from several rebellions during 1806–1808, thus, in 1810, the authorities forced feudal lords to stop excessive exploitation of their peasants. Memory about Tican, the leader of the rebellion, is kept alive in people's tradition until the present day.

The Siege of Malakand was the 26 July – 2 August 1897 siege of the British garrison in the Malakand region of colonial British India's North West Frontier Province.Nevill p. 232 The British faced a force of Pashtun tribesmen whose tribal lands had been bisected by the Durand Line,Lamb p. 93 the 1,519 mile (2,445 km) border between Afghanistan and British India drawn up at the end of the Anglo-Afghan wars to help hold the Russian Empire's spread of influence towards the Indian subcontinent.
The unrest caused by this division of the Pashtun lands led to the rise of Saidullah, a Pashtun fakir who led an army of at least 10,000 against the British garrison in Malakand. Although the British forces were divided amongst a number of poorly defended positions, the small garrison at the camp of Malakand South and the small fort at Chakdara were both able to hold out for six days against the much larger Pashtun army.
The siege was lifted when a relief column dispatched from British positions to the south was sent to assist General William Hope Meiklejohn, commander of the British forces at Malakand South. Accompanying this relief force was second lieutenant Winston Churchill, who later published his account as The Story of the Malakand Field Force: An Episode of Frontier War.

[[Stimulation of nipples]]

CATEGORIES: Breast, Oral eroticism, Sexual acts

Stimulation of nipples is a common human sexual practice, either for itself or as part of other sexual activities. The practice may be performed upon, or by, people of any gender or sexual orientation. Young adult women and men report that breast stimulation not only induces their sexual arousal but enhances it when already aroused.Levin, Roy J. "The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality". Sexual & Relationship Therapy. Vol.21, Issue 2 (May 2006). p.237–249
The male or female breast, nipple and areola develop similarly in the foetus and during infancy. At puberty the male's breasts remain rudimentary but the female's develop further, mainly due to the presence of oestrogen and progesterone, and become more sensitive. All breasts have the same number of nerve endings no matter how large they are. Accordingly, smaller breasts are more sensitive while larger breasts may require more forceful stimulation.
The touching by one person of the breasts and nipples of another is normally an indicator of intimacy, and allowing breasts to be touched is an indication of either an emotional bond and trust between the individuals or, if unwelcome, of submission. Breasts, and especially the nipples, are highly erogenous zones, for both men and women, and have a heightened sensitivity, the stimulation of which may result in the production of erotic sensations or sexual excitement. The touching of nipples can be a form of foreplay giving rise to nipple erection and sexual arousal.
Erect nipples are the most prominent indicators of a female's sexual arousal,[tpl]fact|date=January 2014[/tpl] and the female's sexual partner may find their partner's arousal and erect nipples as their own erotic stimuli. Some people achieve their own sexual arousal by sucking on a nipple or by the sight of an erect nipple, including through clothing. The practice of an adult suckling on a female's breast is sometimes referred as erotic lactation, while a person who is sexually aroused by the sight of a female's breast may be a breast fetishist. A person may experience a spontaneous erection of the nipples, with all the associated physiological changes, as a result of exposure to erotic stimuli or as a reaction to cold.

In infants it can cause  bacteraemia, meningitis and necrotising enterocolitis.

The bacterium is ubiquitous being isolated from a range of environments and foods, and the majority of Cronobacter cases are in the adult population. However it is the association with intrinsically or extrinsically contaminated powdered formula which has attracted the main attention.According to multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) the genus originated ~40 MYA, and the most clinically significant species, C. sakazakii, was distinguishable ~15-23 MYA.

[[2002 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament]]

CATEGORIES: NCAA Division I Baseball Championship, 2002 NCAA Division I baseball season

The 2002 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament was held from May 31 through June 22, 2002. 64 NCAA Division I college baseball teams met after having played their way through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament, to play in the NCAA Tournament. The tournament culminated with eight teams competing in the 2002 College World Series at historic Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska. 
Due to fears over terrorism and travel security in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the Division I Baseball Committee, which selects the 64-team field and places the teams on the bracket, was ordered by the NCAA to keep regional pairings as localized as possible, in order to minimize the number of plane trips utilized. Due to these travel constraints, teams from the same conference were allowed to play in the same regional for the first time. An example of the travel restrictions came from the regional in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, featuring four schools from the Bayou State which are located a total of [tpl]convert|130|mi[/tpl] apart along Interstate 10, the first time (and to date, last) a regional has been entirely an in-state affair outside of California, Florida, and Texas. The travel restrictions were eased in 2003, and the ban on conference teams facing each other in regional play was reinstated.

Saint Romanus of Subiaco (died ca. 550 AD) was a hermit in the area around Subiaco, Italy.
He is remembered as having assisted and influenced Saint Benedict of Nursia, when the latter had just begun his life as a hermit.  Romanus provided Benedict with clothing (a religious habit), food, and housing (in the form of a cave above the river Anio, which Benedict lived in for 3 years) (St. Gregory the Great, Dialogi, II, i).   
Christian tradition states that Romanus departed Italy to escape the barbarian invasions.  He is credited with founding a small monastery at Dryes-Fontrouge in Auxerre, where he died.
He is sometimes identified with the Romanus of Auxerre who was venerated as Bishop of Auxerre on 8 October.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13163a.htm

[[William DuBay]]

CATEGORIES: American activists, Living people, Roman Catholic activists, 1934 births, Writers from Alaska, Writers from California

William DuBay (born 1934) was a U.S. Catholic priest and social activist whose reform activities and suspension from the priesthood created controversy in the mid-1960s.
In February 1966, DuBay was suspended from the priesthood by Cardinal James Francis McIntyre, archbishop of Los Angeles, for criticizing the Catholic Church and for writing The Human Church, a book that was highly critical of the Church hierarchy. In 1964, DuBay publicly requested that Pope Paul VI remove McIntyre from office for his failure to support civil rights for Black people, a demand that garnered national headlines. Wrote DuBay:
DuBay also proposed creating a trade union for Catholic priests. Under DuBay's Federation of Priests, arbitrary transfers would be ended, a tenure policy would give priests the right to a hearing before they could be suspended, and priests would be paid a professional salary in lieu of Mass and baptism offerings.Editors (March 4, 1966) "For a White-Collar Union." Time.
The Human Church called for bishops to be elected for limited terms. It also called for abandoning the parochial school system in favor of programs that teach Catholics the principles of Christian action. The book argued that the Catholic Church should abandon its tax exemptions and let individual congregations create their own liturgies and creeds. Citing DuBay's "public expressions of insubordination" and a lack of the bishop's imprimatur, the Vatican ordered DuBay to cease selling and distributing his book. DuBay protested that "prior censorship is a ghost that has been hovering around the Catholic Church since the Spanish Inquisition" and refused to stop distributing The Human Church.Editors (August 19, 1966) "The Issue of Imprimatur." Time.
DuBay was a chaplain at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and later a parish priest in that city. In 1968, after his suspension from the priesthood, he married Mary Ellen Wall in Idyllwild, California.Editors (August 11, 1968) "Suspended Priest Marries Divorcee." New York Times. p. 38. They had a child, Zubi. From 1975 to 1987, DuBay lived in Alaska, where he edited The Arctic Policy Review, a monthly magazine that covered economic and political developments in the Arctic. In 1988, he returned to southern California and became a technical writer and writing teacher.
DuBay is the author of "Roots of the Holocaust", a book that attempts to understand the youth of Adolf Hitler in Vienna. The work examines the city and experiences that formed Hitler as a man.http://impact-information.com/wordpress/?page_id=27
In 1965, Tom Laughlin told the Milwaukee Sentinel that he planned to make a film about DuBay, but the film never came to fruition.[tpl]cite news|last=Herzog|first=Buck|title=Laughlin Plans Second Film|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2MMVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QREEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7050,60616&dq=tom+laughlin&hl=en|work=Milwaukee Sentinel|date=July 1, 1965|accessdate=February 19, 2010[/tpl]

[[De-asphalter]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical equipment, Distillation, Petroleum technology

A de-asphalter is a unit in a crude oil refinery or bitumen upgrader that separates asphalt from crude oil or bitumen. 
The de-asphalter unit is usually placed after the vacuum distillation tower. It is usually a solvent de-asphalter unit, SDA. The SDA separates the asphalt from the feedstock because light hydrocarbons will dissolve aliphatic compounds but not asphaltenes. The output from the de-asphalter unit is de-asphalted oil ("DAO") and asphalt. 
DAO from propane de-asphalting has the highest quality but lowest yield, whereas using pentane may double or triple the yield from a heavy feed, but at the expense of contamination by metals and carbon residues that shorten the life of downstream cracking catalysts.[tpl]cite book |author=John J. McKetta |title=Petroleum Processing Handbook |publisher=CRC Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-8247-8681-6 |page=536 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xlqsr_K59mcC&pg=PP1&dq=McKetta,+John+J.+Petroleum+Processing+Handbook.[/tpl] If the solvent is butane the unit will be referred to as a butane de-asphalter ("BDA") and if the solvent is propane, it will be called a propane de-asphalter ("PDA") unit.

Adhesive dentistry is a branch of dentistry which deals with adhesion or bonding to the natural substance of teeth, enamel and dentin. It studies the nature and strength of adhesion to dental hard tissues, properties of adhesive materials, causes and mechanisms of failure of the bonds, clinical techniques for bonding and newer applications for bonding such as bonding to the soft tissue.The Journal of Adhesive Dentistry: Online Introduction There's also direct composite bonding which uses tooth-colored direct dental composites to repair various tooth damages such as cracks or gaps.
Dental bonding is a dental procedure in which a dentist applies a tooth-colored resin material (a durable plastic material) and cures it with visible, blue light. This ultimately "bonds" the material to the tooth and improves the overall appearance of teeth.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] Tooth bonding techniques have various clinical applications including operative dentistry and preventive dentistry as well as cosmetic and pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics, and orthodontics.

Dirck van Cloon (also Dirk van Cloon; 1684 – 10 March 1735) was Eurasian Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. He died of malaria at the age of 46.
He was born in Batavia sometime in 1684. For his education and training he was sent to the Netherlands. He graduated in Law at Leiden University on 1 April 1707. 
He returned he to Batavia on the clipper Donkervliet and spent some time in Dutch Coromandel. He was among other things a district overseer in Sadraspatnam. He got into a fight with the governor of Coromandel, Adriaan de Visser, who accused Van Cloon of delivering bad quality goods. The government in Batavia sent Van Cloon back to the Netherlands, but he persuaded the Directors of the Dutch East India Company  that de Visser was not to be trusted. Van Cloon was reinstated and he left for the Indies on 4 November 1719 on board the ‘van de Huis te Assenburg’ as Supercargo. In 1720, he became district chief at Negapatnam. In 1723, he became Governor of Dutch Coromandel. In 1724, he returned to Batavia to advise the Governor-General and in 1730, he became “Raad-ordinair” (chief advisor) of the Indies.
On the 9th of October 1731 the Directors of the Dutch East India Company named Dirck van Cloon Governor-General of the Indies, to which he succeed on 28 May 1732, following the disgrace of  Diederik Durven. By 20 December 1733 van Cloon was asking to resign because of sickness. He died in post, however, and it was not until after he had died that his successor took over. Van Cloon was involved in a stand-off with the nascent Swedish East India Company, but he resolved it amicably. Less happy was an insurrection of unemployed Chinese sugar plantation workers. This was caused by the collapse of the sugar market, due to over-production and government mishandling.

Mutchmor Public School is an elementary school in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located in The Glebe neighbourhood at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Lyon. It is run by the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board
The original portion of the school was built in 1895 making Mutchmor one of the oldest schools in Ottawa. Only two other schools built in Ottawa in the late nineteenth century remain, with nearby First Avenue Public School being one. Further additions were made to the school in 1911 and 1920. The building is officially designated as a heritage structure. 
The school is home to nearly 400 students from junior kindergarten to grade six. Mutchmor provides many programs, including the regular English language program (also known as Core French), a Congregated Gifted program, and a Middle French immersion program. Students typically attend either Glashan Public School or Hopewell Public School for grades seven and eight.
In the 1990s Mutchmor was threatened with closure by the school board. Action by the local community ensured that Mutchmor stayed open, and enrollment is growing steadily. In 2005 Today's Parent magazine named Mutchmor one of the top 40 schools in Canada, highlighting how the school 'rose to the challenge'.

The Kiev pogrom of October 18-October 20 (October 31-November 2, 1905, N.S.) came as a result of the collapse of the city hall meeting of October 18, 1905 in Kiev in the Russian Empire. Consequently, a mob was drawn into the streets. Among the perpetrators were monarchists, reactionaries, anti-Semites, and common criminals, proclaiming that "all Russia's troubles stemmed from the machinations of the Jews and socialists." The pogrom resulted in a massacre of approximately 100 Jews.Early Twentieth Century Timelines: Russia in Chaos http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:t6GLE-cUxQMJ:cnparm.home.texas.net/Nat/Rus/Rus02.htm+Kiev+Pogrom+(1905)&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=15&gl=ca
According to William C. Fuller,William C. Fuller, The Foe Within: Fantasies of Treason and the End of Imperial Russia, 2006
The events building up to the Kiev pogrom included a country-wide wave of Jewish pogroms in a number of Russian towns. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia,Herman Rosenthal Encyclopedia, volume I pg. 347 "anti-Jewish riots (Pogromy) broke out in Elizabethgrad (April 27, 28), Kiev (May 8-11), Shpola (May 9), Ananyiv (May 9), Wasilkov (May 10), Konotop (May 10), and during the following six months, in one hundred and sixty other places of southern Russia...It was clear that the riots were premeditated.  To give but one example—a week before the pogrom of Kiev broke out, Von Hubbenet, chief of police of Kiev, warned some of his Jewish friends of the coming riots."
In the opinion of “a Russian from Kiev”, published in Prince Vladimir Meshchersky's journal, Grazhdanin (The Citizen), as quoted by Vladimir Lenin,V.I.

[[Value-action gap]]

CATEGORIES: Geography terminology

The value-action gap is the gap that can occur when the values or attitudes of an individual do not correlate to his or her actions. More generally, it is the difference between what people say and what people do. The phrase is associated with environmental geography, relating to attitudes and behaviors surrounding environmental issues.  Usually attitudes affect behavior; however the opposite often seems to be the case with regard to environmental attitudes and values.
The outcome is that there is a gap between the high value people place on the natural environment and the relatively low level of action taken by individuals to counter environmental problems. This disparity has been termed the ‘value-action gap’, or occasionally, it is referred to as the ‘attitude-behavior gap’.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kollmuss|first=Anja|coauthors=Julian Agyeman|title=Mind the Gap: Why do people act environmentally and what are the barriers to pro-environmental behavior?|journal=Environmental Education Research|year=2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=239–260[/tpl]
Debates surrounding the issue of the value-action gap have mainly taken place within environmental and social psychology and research is often based within cognitive theories of how attitudes are formed and how this affects individuals’ behavior.[tpl]cite journal|last=Blake|first=J.|title=23.	Overcoming the 'value-action gap' in environmental policy: Tensions between national policy and local experience|journal=Local Environment: The International Journal of Justice and Sustainability|year=1999|volume=4|issue=3|pages=257–278[/tpl] This aims to explain why those with a high regard for environmental issues do not translate this concern into behaviors to solve environmental issues.
The research suggests that there are many internal and external factors that affect behavior and the reasons behind consumer choices. Therefore, it can be difficult to identify the exact reasons for why this gap exists. When purchasing a product for example, many attributes are assessed by the purchaser in order to make their decision such as; price, quality, convenience, and brand familiarity.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dickson|first=M.|title=Utility of no sweat labels for apparel consumers: Profiling label users and predicting their purchases|journal=The Journal of Consumer Affairs|year=2001|volume=35|issue=1|pages=96–119[/tpl] These factors influence the reasons behind buying behavior and environmental considerations are often not taken into account, regardless of the attitudes people have regarding the environment. 
Overcoming this gap is of particular importance for environmental policies as finding ways to overcome it should increase the effectiveness of these strategies. This would lead to a fundamental shift in behavior towards the environment and individuals’ use of natural resources, ensuring sustainable development and conservation of the environment.

CATEGORIES: Criminal records, Law enforcement databases in the United States

The Interstate Identification Index or III (pronounced "triple-eye") is a national index of criminal histories (or rap sheets) in the United States of America, maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at the National Crime Information Center.  Included in this index are individuals who have been arrested or indicted for "a serious criminal offense anywhere in the country".Interstate Identification Index Name Check Efficacy: Report of the National Task Force to the U.S. Attorney General (July 1999). p 7 in PDF, p 1 in document. Retrieved on 2008-07-31.  NCJ-179358.  
The program is designed to facilitate the interstate exchange of criminal history records among State justice agencies. In addition to the interstate exchange, this index holds millions of fingerprint identification cards for criminals who have committed a serious enough crime to go to jail for over 24 hours.FBI's National Crime information Center -  Testimony of Michael D. Kirkpatrick, Assistant Director in Charge, Criminal Justice Information Services Division, FBI before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Citizenship, Committee on the Judiciary (November 13, 2003)
Search results from the III give a list of states that have a criminal history on a given person.  An investigator or analyst may then query those states directly to get specific criminal history, either through the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) or by other means.
This makes the criminal justice system of each participating state no longer a completely closed system; the increased exchange of information between different law enforcement agencies increases the chances of bringing multi-state offenders to justice.

George Arthur Boeckling (February 2, 1862 – July 24, 1931) was a German businessman who served as the president of Cedar Point Pleasure Company, which later became Cedar Fair Entertainment Company.  He is often credited for bringing Cedar Point out of the hole at the turn of the 20th century and making it a nationally recognized amusement park and resort destination.
G.A. Boeckling was born to German immigrants in Indiana in 1862. In 1897, he became general manager of the newly formed Cedar Point Pleasure Resort Company. Under Boeckling’s leadership, Cedar Point was transformed from a summer picnic area to a thriving amusement park with wide appeal. In 1908, the steamer G.A. Boeckling started providing local transportation between the city of Sandusky and Cedar Point. Thousands of visitors also arrived at Cedar Point on the Pennsylvania Railroad and Lake Shore Electric Railway.
G.A. Boeckling was very public-spirited, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, Elks Lodge, Aerie of Eagles, and was charitable to local churches, veterans organizations, and youth clubs of Sandusky. In 1922 the Sandusky Register called him “the man who made Cedar Point.” George A. Boeckling died from Uremia on July 24, 1931, and is buried at Oakland Cemetery.[tpl]Cite news|title = G. A.

[[Morgenthau Report]]

The Morgenthau report was a report issued by the United States' commission led by Henry Morgenthau, Sr., Homer H. Johnson, Brigadier General Edgar Jadwin, and from the British side Sir Stuart M. Samuel to investigate reports of mistreatment of Ashkenazi Jews in Poland. The report was published on October 3, 1919.
Western public opinion had become increasingly aware, primarily from newspaper reports, of mistreatment and atrocities committed against Jews in Eastern Europe, following the aftermath of the First World War and the flare-up of several local conflicts (such as the Polish-Ukrainian and Polish-Soviet wars). In June 1919, Herbert Hoover, then head of the American Relief Administration (ARA), after discussions with Polish Prime Minister Ignacy Jan Paderewski, wrote to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson warning that the reports of atrocities were damaging the reputation of Poland, a nascent ally being cultivated by the U.S. to counter Soviet Russia.Mieczysław B. Biskupski, Piotr Stefan Wandycz. Ideology, Politics, and Diplomacy in East Central Europe. Boydell & Brewer, 2003, p.62 Hoover, whose ARA oversaw relief efforts in Europe, secured the support of Padrewski through blunt warnings that the reports of atrocities against Jews "could develop into a most serious embarrassment to all of us in connection with the relief of Poland." Such pressure for government action reached the point where President Woodrow Wilson sent an official commission to investigate the matter. The Morgenthau commission was dispatched by the United States to verify those reports.Mieczysław B. Biskupski, Piotr Stefan Wandycz. Ideology, Politics, and Diplomacy in East Central Europe. Boydell & Brewer, 2003, p.69Sonja Wentling. "The Engineer and the Shtadlanim: Herbert Hoover and American Jewish non-Zionists, 1917-28." American Jewish History 88, 3(September 2000): 377-406.
Morgenthau's delegation was met by thousands of Polish Jews in Warsaw and other Polish cities it visited.Mieczysław B. Biskupski, Piotr Stefan Wandycz. Ideology, Politics, and Diplomacy in East Central Europe. Boydell & Brewer, 2003, pg.72[ref]Henry Morgenthau, French Strother. All in a Life-time. Doubleday, Page and Company, 1922, p. 360.
Original from the New York Public Library, digitized Jul 17, 2007>[/ref] although Morgenthau—an assimilationist critical of Jewish nationalism—was shunned by Polish Zionist leaders. While the Polish Jewish press gave the delegation a warm welcome, the non-Jewish Polish press response ranged from cool to overtly hostile with instances of open expressions of anti-Jewish hostility. The daily Robotnicza called for a complete boycott of Polish Jews, while the leading weekly Mysl Niepodlegla accused Wilson of siding against the Polish people in favor of Jews who "live upon usury, fraud, receiving of stolen goods, white slavery, counterfeiting and willful bankruptcy." While Paderewski had welcomed the investigation, Morgenthau found hostility in other Polish political circles, especially from the camps of National Democratic Party ("Endecja") leader Roman Dmowski and his rival, Chief of State Jozef Pilsudski. Compared to Paderewski, who had substantial U.S. support, Pilsudski at the time was regarded as a less reliable military adventurer, and was described by Morgenthau as a "high-class pirate."Neal Pease. Poland, the United States, and the Stabilization of Europe, 1919-1933. Oxford University Press US, 1986. Page 9. Pilsudski resented the interference of Morgenthau's mission in Polish affairs, although he was acknowledged as an opponent of the open anti-semitism of Dmowski and a leader committed to a liberal policy towards Jews and other minorities that respected their rights. Morgenthau immersed himself in meetings with representatives of all segments of Polish society from all sides of the dispute. He attended a packed service for the 35 Jewish victims of the Pinsk massacre of April 1919, noting afterward that "This was the first time I ever completely realized what the collective grief of a persecuted people was like."Neal Pease.

The Morgenthau report ultimately identified eight major incidents in the years 1918–1919, and estimated the number of victims at between 200 and 300 Jews. Four of these were attributed to the actions of deserters and undisciplined individual soldiers; none were blamed on official government policy. Among the incidents investigated by the Morgenthau mission was the Pinsk massacre. In Pinsk, a Polish officer accused a group of Jewish civilians who had gathered at a town meeting to discuss the distribution of American relief aid of being Bolsheviks and of plotting against the Poles. Thirty-five of the men were taken hostage, robbed, and summarily shot. Women were separated from the men and stripped and beaten. The Morgenthau mission issued a strong condemnation of the commander responsible: While it is recognized that certain information of Bolshevist activities in Pinsk had been reported by two Jewish soldiers, we are convinced that Major Luczynski, the Town Commander, showed reprehensible and frivolous readiness to place credence in such untested assertions, and on this insufficient basis took inexcusably drastic action against reputable citizens whose loyal character could have been immediately established by a consultation with any well known non-Jewish inhabitant.[ref]Reproduced in: Henry Morgenthau, French Strother.

The report states that in Lemberg Lviv "disreputable elements the Polish Army plundered to the extent of many millions of crowns the dwellings and stores in the Jewish quarter, and did not hesitate to murder when they met with resistance."David Engel.

While critical of some local Polish authorities on scene, the commission also stated that in general the Polish military and civil authorities did do their best to prevent the incidents and their recurrence in the future. It concluded that some forms of discrimination against Jews was of political rather than anti-Semitic nature, rooted in political competition. The report specifically avoided use of the term "pogrom," noting that the term was used to apply to a wide range of "excesses," (Morgenthau's preferred term) and had no specific definition. Tadeusz Piotrowski, noted that Morgenthau reasons for avoiding the word pogrom was based on the chaotic conditions existing within a war zone.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | author =Tadeusz Piotrowski | coauthors = | title =Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide... | year =1997 | editor = | pages =p. 41–42| chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =McFarland & Company | location = | isbn =0-7864-0371-3 | format = | accessdate = [/tpl]
Morganthau noted that it would be unfair to condemn the entire Polish nation for the acts of renegade troops or mobs, and believed the attacks were not premeditated or the result of a preconceived plan. He noted, however, that "It is believed that these excesses were the result of a widespread anti-Semitic prejudice aggravated by the belief that the Jewish inhabitants were politically hostile to the Polish State."Quoted in: Andrzej Kapiszewski, Controversial Reports on the Situation of the Jews in Poland in the Aftermath of World War Studia Judaica 7: 2004 nr 2(14) s. 257-304 (pdf) 
Jadwin and Johnson submitted their report separately from Morgenthau's. As described by one historian[tpl]Who|date=September 2008[/tpl] Morgenthau emphasized that Jews had been deliberately murdered based solely on the fact that they were Jews, while Jadwin and Johnson concluded that the violence against Jews in Poland was largely rooted in Jewish separatism and commercial competition.
Assessments of the mission's works varied, with supporters and critics alternately concluding that it had either debunked allegations of Polish anti-semitism or provided support for them. Hoover considered the mission as having done a "fine service," while others considered its findings to be a "whitewash" of Polish atrocities.
The possibility of bias in the Morgenthau report has been discussed by some scholars. Andrzej Kapiszewski has written that the report was influeneced by U.S. foreign policy objectives at the time. Neal Pease wrote, "To protect Poland's international reputation against widespread, if exaggerated, accusations of mistreatment of her large Jewish minority, Washington dispatched an investigatory commission led by Henry Morgenthau, one of the most prominent American Jewish political figures. Morgenthau was selected for the job precisely because he was known to be sympathetic to Poland, and his report largely exculpated the Polish government, exactly as expected." Neal Pease, Poland, the United States, and the Stabilization of Europe, 1919-1933, Oxford University Press, 1986, page 10 Some contemporary responses in the Jewish press accused Morgenthau and Samuel, the Jewish members of the commission, of having presented a "whitewash" of the massacres, and charged them with being guilty of treason.Norman Davies.

CATEGORIES: Cherokee towns, Geography of Swain County, North Carolina, Indigenous topics of the Southeastern Woodlands, Communities of the Great Smoky Mountains

The Cherokee believe the ancient settlement of Kituwa (also spelled Kituwah, Keetoowah, Kittowa, and other similar variations) or giduwa (Cherokee:ᎩᏚᏩ), on the Tuckasegee River is their original settlement and is one of the "seven mother towns" in the Southeast.  It is in Swain County, North Carolina, in the Great Smoky Mountains, near present-day Bryson City.
Cherokee oral traditions tell that all Cherokee migrated to Kituwa after the migration from the Great Lakes region of the United States and southern Canada as early as 4,000 years ago. Cultural and archaeological evidence support the people's accounts of their migration, but there is no consensus about when they arrived in the Southeast.[tpl]cite book |last= Mooney |first= James |authorlink= James Mooney |title= Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees |publisher= Kessinger Publishing |origyear= 1900 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-1-4286-4864-7 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=9HDbWUX71joC |page= 393[/tpl]
The ancient Cherokee had a hereditary priesthood, called the Ah-ni-ku-ta-ni, a structure which may have been adopted from another tribe.  According to research by the early 20th century ethnographer James Mooney, the Cherokee held the Ah-ni-ku-ta-ni "in awe" and "greatly feared them." They were not the regular chiefs. These were known as the ugus (owls), known as "white" chiefs (sometimes identified as those who worked for peace or during times of peace), and the colona (ravens), or "red" chiefs (identified as those who led in times of war.)

The Avro Type H, Type 501, and Type 503 were a family of early British military seaplanes. They were a development of the Avro 500 design and were originally conceived of as amphibious; the prototype being fitted with a single large main float (equipped with wheels) under the fuselage, and two outrigger floats under the wings. Tests were conducted on Windermere in January 1913. It was later converted to twin-float configuration and bought by the British Admiralty. It now, however, proved too heavy and was converted again - this time to a landplane.
An improved version, designated the 503 was demonstrated for the Inspector of Naval Aircraft, who placed an order for three machines. The prototype itself was demonstrated for the German Navy in its seaplane trials in June 1913 and was purchased by the government of Imperial Germany for evaluation purposes. This machine subsequently became the first aircraft to fly across the North Sea, from Wilhelmshaven to Heligoland, in September 1913. Gotha purchased a licence from Avro and produced the type as the WD.1 (Wasser Doppeldecker - "Water Biplane"). Unlicenced copies were also built by Albatros, AGO, Friedrichshafen. Some WD.1s were provided to the Ottoman Empire following their withdrawal from German Navy service.

The Edith B. Barill Bridge, more commonly known as the Star City Bridge, was completed in 2004 and connects Star City, West Virginia with Interstate 79 and western Monongalia County.  The bridge serves as a primary means of access to the north side of Morgantown.
The former Star City Bridge was built in 1950. In 2002, that bridge was demolished and replaced by the current five-lane bridge that was completed in 2004.  It has since been dedicated the Edith Barill Bridge after a long-time Star City mayor but is still generally known as the Star City Bridge.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091101162739/http://www.transportation.wv.gov/highways/communications/bridge_facts/Modern-Bridges/Pages/StarCity.aspx|archivedate=November 1, 2009|url=http://www.transportation.wv.gov/highways/communications/bridge_facts/Modern-Bridges/Pages/StarCity.aspx|title=Edit B.

The new Star City Bridge is equipped with over 700 sensors that measure the weight, speed, and number of vehicles that cross it. This data will be studied at West Virginia University, and used to study the effect of everyday traffic on the bridge, but especially large, commercial trucks. The sensors will also measure how the bridge expands and contracts in the different temperatures of each season. The data will be used for the West Virginia Division of Highways to find and correct weak points in the bridge.

He participated in his first battle on 15 May 1793, against revolutionary French forces during the opening of the Battle of Mas Deu, part of the War of the Pyrenees. Freire spent the next two years in Rousillon and Catalonia, including that war's last actions during which Spanish forces recaptured Puigcerda and Bellver (after the peace treaty had been signed).Urquijo Goitia, José Ramón [tpl]es[/tpl] "Diccionario biográfico de ministros".

[[European superstate]]

CATEGORIES: Political terminology, Politics of the European Union, Nationalist movements in Europe

European Superstate is a term mainly used to describe a potential result of the European Union's integration, though it could also be linked to other historical attempts to bring the continent together as one single national entity.
Traditionally, the term 'European Superstate', particularly within the UK, is used as a criticism of further integration into the EU with the term implying a forced loss of national sovereignty.http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/eucost.html 
Along with this connotation is the implication of the loss of individual state's national identity with the replacement of one single homogenous identity which groups such as UKIP argue is a goal which the EU is trying to achieve.http://www.ukip.org/content/prince-charles-and-the-eu/490-nigel-did-the-right-thing
The term is often used in contrast to an idea of a Federal Europe which argues that  is to accommodate other national identitities with partial sovereignty being retained by individual member states, though often the terms are mistakely used synonymously.

[[Rodulff]]
CATEGORIES: Church of Finland, Finnish Roman Catholics, Year of birth missing, Year of death missing

Rodulff (Rodulf) is claimed by a 15th-century chronicle Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium to have worked as a missionary "bishop" in Finland after Bishop Henry had died in the 1150s.Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium by an unknown writer. Part of the Palmsköld collection. In Latin.Brief biography of Rodulff by the Archdiocese of Turku. In Finnish. Rodulff was allegedly from Västergötland in Sweden.
No historical records of Rodulff survive, and no Bishop or Diocese of Finland is mentioned in a papal letter from 1171 (or 1172) by the seemingly well-informed Pope Alexander III, who otherwise addressed the situation of the church in Finland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=24|title=Letter by Pope Alexander III to the Archbishop of Uppsala|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927051438/http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=24|archivedate=2007-09-27[/tpl]. In Latin. Hosted by the National Archive of Finland. See http://www.narc.fi/Arkistolaitos/sahkoiset/ and Diplomatarium Fennicum from the menu. However, the Pope mentions that there were preachers, presumably from Sweden, working in Finland and was worried about their bad treatment by the Finns. Pope had earlier in 1165 authorized the first missionary Bishop of Estonia to be appointed, and was a close acquaintance of both Eskil, the Archbishop of Lund, and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who both had spent time with him in France where he had been exiled in the 1160s. Following the situation in Estonia, Pope personally interfered in the Estonian mission in 1171.See Rebane 2001.

[[Au (Munich)]]

CATEGORIES: Quarters of Munich

Au is a district in the south eastern plain tract of the German city of Munich in Bavaria. Au extends from the Deutsches Museum in the north and along the Isar up to Wittelsbacherbrücke (Wittelsbacher Bridge) in the south.
In the centre of the area the Auer Dult takes place three times a year on the Mariahilfplatz, which is the largest annual market in Munich.
Bordering boroughs of the city are Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt and Altstadt-Lehel on the western side of the Isar, Untergiesing-Harlaching in the south and Giesing in the south-east. The Haidhausen district lies to the east and along with Au, forms the Au-Haidhausen borough of the city.
Au was first documented on 12 December 1340 as "Awe ze Gysingen", with Awe meaning "Land on water". In 1808 Au was made part of Munich as Vorstadt Au ("Suburb of Au"). In 1818, along with Untergiesing (what the settlement at Nockherberg had been referred to as), Au formed its own munincipality. On 1 October 1854 the district was incorporated into Munich.
Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, a 1974 World Cup champion has operated a stationery shop in Au for over 20 years.

Clark Stanley (b. c. 1854 in Abilene, Texas), the self-styled "Rattlesnake King," marketed snake oil as a patent medicine.
In 1879, after 11 years as a cowboy, Stanley studied for more than two years with a Hopi medicine man at Walpi, Arizona[tpl]fact|date=February 2013[/tpl].  This included learning the secrets of snake oil.  With the help of a Boston druggist he began marketing his product at Western medicine shows.  In 1893 he and his rattlesnakes became a hit attraction at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.  His act included the killing of rattlesnakes and squeezing their bodies, what came out he labeled snake oil.  Later he went on to establish production facilities in Beverly, Massachusetts and Providence, Rhode Island.
In 1915, subsequent to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, Stanley's concoction was examined and found to be of no value (it was mostly mineral oil).  He was fined $20.00 and established the term snake oil as any worthless concoction sold as medicine.

[[The Football Factory (novel)]]

CATEGORIES: 1996 novels, British novels, Chelsea F.C., British novels adapted into films, Novels by John King (author), Jonathan Cape books

The Football Factory is the controversial debut novel of author John King, and is based around the adventures of a group of working-class Londoners who follow Chelsea home and away, fighting their rivals on the streets of England’s cities. The principal character/narrator is Tommy Johnson, whose internal monologues allow the reader an inside view of football hooliganism and the adrenaline highs involved. Major battles take place with Chelsea’s traditional enemies, among them Tottenham and Millwall, and the book’s authenticity has often been commented upon. The language used is hard-hitting but imaginative, as Tommy’s anger and outspoken views on life in modern-day Britain delve into a range of subjects including class, patriotism, prejudice, poverty and the political system. Tommy Johnson is a white, English male and fed up of being told he is rubbish.
Equally as important to the novel’s structure is the presence of pensioner Bill Farrell, a former soldier who fought in the Second World and was decorated for his bravery. After the war he married a concentration-camp survivor, and is trying to cope with her recent death. He is seen as a hero by subsequent generations, among them Tommy and various older members of the Chelsea firm, hardcore hooligans such as Dave Harris and Billy Bright. Bill Farrell is a calmer voice, but while his more measured reflections present an alternative approach to that of the younger men, he shares their frustrations and feelings of powerlessness. Vignettes from a range of minor characters are also included, among them the story of Vince Matthews, a former hooligan who has broken out of the circle of violence to travel the world.
The Football Factory is rich in cultural references, from popular music to the songs and chants of the terraces. Tommy remembers the glory days of the Shed at Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea North Stand and Gate 13, along with his own assessments of opposing players and supporters. The role of a sensationalist media and the hypocrisy of the political classes is highlighted in relation to football-connected violence, with modern warfare brought into the equation. London is shown in detail, the allegiance to a football club as an extension of community, in many cases involving populations that have been displaced. Whether it is a street, pub, greasy spoon, Indian restaurant or launderette, the reader will know which part of London they are seeing.
On its release The Football Factory was heralded as a ‘state of the nation’ novel by some reviewers, while others criticised its aversion to political correctness. Football fans and the wider public made it a best-seller. It has been translated into a number of languages and was followed by Headhunters and England Away. Together these three novels make up The Football Factory Trilogy. In 2004 the book was turned into a high-profile film by director Nick Love, starring Danny Dyer as Tommy Johnson and Dudley Sutton as Bill Farrell. The controversy of the book’s initial release was repeated, as the subject matter and the presence of a number of known Chelsea hooligans among the extras caused great excitement in the media.

Although wolf attacks on humans do occur, their frequency varies with geographical location and historical period. Wolf attacks are dangerous not only for the victims, but also the attackers, who are often subsequently killed, or even extirpated in reaction. As a result, wolves today tend to live mostly far from people or have developed the tendency and ability to avoid them. The country with the most extensive historical records is France, where nearly 7,600 fatal attacks were documented in from 1200–1920.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Moriceau, Jean-Marc (2013), Sur les pas du loup: Tour de France et atlas historiques et culturels du loup, du moyen âge à nos jours the trail of the wolf: a tour of France and a historical and cultural atlas of the wolf, from the Middle Ages to modern times, Paris, Montbel, ISBN 978-2-35653-067-7 In modern times, they occur most often in India and neighboring countries. There are few historical records or modern cases of wolf attacks in North America. In the half-century up to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, none in North America, and more than 200 in south Asia.[tpl]Harvnb|Linnell|2002|p=[/tpl] Experts categorize wolf attacks into various types, including rabies-infected, predatory, agonistic, and defensive.

[[Vésuviennes]]
CATEGORIES: Feminism and history, Feminism in France, 1848 in France

The Vésuviennes were a radical feminist group that existed in France in the middle of the 19th century. They chose their name (derived from Mount Vesuvius) because, in their words, "Like lava, so long held back, that must at last pour out around us, idea of feminist equality is in no way incendiary but in all ways regenerating."
With the overthrow of King Louis-Philippe of France in 1848, the newly formed Republic lifted all restrictions on the press and assembly. This encouraged a proliferation of new feminist publications, organizations, and groups. The Vésuviennes were among the latter. Considered to be the most radical of all of the feminist factions of the time, the Vésuviennes promoted female military service, the right of women to dress the same as men, and legal and domestic equality between husband and wife, even as that extended to the distribution of household chores. Most Vésuviennes were between the ages of 15 and 30, unmarried, poorly paid workers. Even some other feminists disapproved of their tactics, which included wearing culottes (not unlike the bloomers worn by radical American feminists at the time) and staging frequent street demonstrations.
The image of a young woman in culottes came to represent all feminists to some, as can be seen in the caricatures of Edouard de Beaumont, one of several artists who satirized the efforts of feminists of the period in popular political papers such as Le Charivari.
Until recently the existence of this feminist organization was regarded as genuine, if poorly documented. Some historians have recently argued that the organisation was itself "a burlesque creation of the French police who drew up a constitution for it and provided it with prostitutes as members".[tpl]cite book|author=James McMillan|title=France and Women, 1789-1914: Gender, Society and Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jijIhhg3DakC&pg=PA93|accessdate=16 September 2012|year=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis US|isbn=978-0-415-22603-5|page=93[/tpl]

The Kruščica Rebellion ([tpl]lang-sr|Крушчичка буна[/tpl], Kruščička buna) was a joint rebellion of Serbs and Romanians in south Banat, which lasted for only one day. The rebellion started on July 12, 1808, in the village Kruščica near Bela Crkva, which in this time was part of the Banatian Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire. The leaders of the rebellion were Dimitrije Đorđević (deacon), Toma Stipeće (liutenant), Marijan Josipović (retired frajkor captain), and Pivu Žumanka (retired liutenant). 
The rebel leaders have called people to join the rebellion using the false letter supposedly written by Karađorđe, in which he called them to start this rebellion. The rebellion started by church bells ringing, after which the priest, escorted by the people, started horse riding towards the place where Karađorđe supposedly had to meet with them. However, instead to meet with Karađorđe, the rebels met a squad of the Austrian army, which immediately escorted them to the prison. Liutenant Stipeće was sentenced to death and executed in 1811, while deacon Dimitrije Đorđević was sentenced to life in prison.

Federico Zeri (August 21, 1921 - October 5, 1998) was an Italian art historian, a specialist in Italian Renaissance painting.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-federico-zeri-1176615.html | title = Obituary: Federico Zeri | date = 1998-10-07 |  last = Hanley | first = Anne | newspaper = The Independent | accessdate = 2014-01-09[/tpl] He wrote for the Italian newspaper La Stampa, and was a well known television-personality in Italy. He had given lifelong effort to acquainting  lesser known artists, schools and works.
Zeri was born in central Rome, and graduated from Sapienza University of Rome in 1945. Not wishing to entrench in the academic world, he worked in the Ministry of Public Education until 1952. In 1948 he was made director of Galleria Spada in Rome.
In 1963 Zeri was among the founding members of the Getty Villa's board of trustees. He had left in 1984, after his opinion, that the Getty kouros was a forgery and should not be bought, was not accepted.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/zerif.htm | title=Zeri, Federico | work=Dictionary of Art Historians | accessdate=8 January 2014[/tpl]
He pointed at other forgeries and mis-attributions. In 1984, when four students, planting sculptures in a canal in Livorno, hoaxed both the city and Modigliani experts, he was among the few who called on the amateurish style.[tpl]Cite news| issn = 0028-7504| last = Hope| first = Charles| title = The Art of the Phony| work = The New York Review of Books| accessdate = 2014-01-11| date = 2013-08-15| url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/aug/15/forgery-art-phony/[/tpl] Regarding some frescoes at the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi, he argued they are works of Pietro Cavallini rather than Giotto. Zeri insisted that a painting can be attributed to an artist, by means of a careful examination or connoisseurship, without resort to external evidence such as documents or dates. The work is to be systematically characterised by its techniques and ideas, which in turn would evidence a circle of artists and schools that influenced the author's development, and from whom he borrowed, with their relative importance. An hypothetical biography can then be constructed, of an anonymous person that was able to meet all those influences and study their work. At which stage, historians might be inclined to attribute other known works to Anonymous. Finally, a matching historical person might be found in documentation.[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/02666286.2008.10405738 | issn = 0266-6286 | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 162–175 | last = Lugli | first = Emanuele | title = Connoisseurship as a system: Reflections on Federico Zeri's Due dipinti, la filologia e un nome | journal = Word & Image | accessdate = 2014-01-12 | date = 2008| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02666286.2008.10405738[/tpl]

Mercian Cycles is an English custom bicycle manufacturer based in Derby, Derbyshire.Kolin and de la Rosa, 1979, pp. 60-68 Mercian was founded by Tom Crowther and Lou Barker in 1946 and named after the ancient kingdom of Mercia.  Mercian Cycles operates a retail shop in Alvaston.Juden, 2010, pp. 37-38
Current production is around 300 to 400 frames per year, with 20% being exported outside the United Kingdom. As of 2010, touring bicycles account for around 67% of Mercian's production, with track bicycles making up another 25%.
Frames are generally custom-built to a rider's required dimensions, and may use hand-cut lugs. Mercian frames were traditionally built using steel, originally Reynolds 531, though as of 2010, newer steels such as Reynolds 853 and Reynolds 953 and part-carbon construction were in use. Before steel was superseded by lighter materials, riders using Mercian won national and international competitions.
From the original founders, the business passed to Ethel Crowther, ex-wife of founder Tom Crowther. It then passed to Mercian framebuilder Bill Betton. In 2002, Mercian Cycles was acquired by Grant Mosely and Jane Mosely.
Mercian has recently commissioned frame colour schemes from designer Sir Paul Smith, who owns and rides several Mercian track bikes.

CATEGORIES: Golf

Perfect round is a term used to define a round of eighteen holes of golf where all holes were played at one under par (birdie on every hole) resulting in a score of 55 on a par 73 course, 54 on a par 72 course, 53 on a par 71 course, and 52 on a par 70 course.  Since a score of 18 is the lowest score that could theoretically be obtained, perfect round is an incorrect term for the score of 54 (or whatever 18 under par is).  54, however, is the lowest score generally accepted as being in the realm of possibility among professional golfers on a par 72 course.  This has remained the standard and has never been achieved by a professional golfer in a professional event.

[[Faiyum Oasis]]
CATEGORIES: Faiyum Governorate, Geography of ancient Egypt, Oases of Egypt

The Faiyum Oasis (or Al-Fayoum Oasis, Al Fayyum Oasis, and other variations in spelling) is a depression or basin in the desert immediately to the west of the Nile south of Cairo. The extent of the basin area is estimated at between 1,270 km² (490 mi²) and 1700 km² (656 mi²). The basin floor comprises fields watered by a channel of the Nile, the Bahr Yussef, as it drains into a desert depression to the west of the Nile Valley. The Bahr Yussef veers west through a narrow neck of land north of Ihnasya, between the archaeological sites of El-Lahun and Gurob near Hawara; it then branches out, providing rich agricultural land in the Faiyum basin, draining into the large saltwater Lake Moeris (Birket Qarun). The lake was freshwater in prehistory but is today a saltwater lake. It is a source for tilapia and other fish for the local area.
Differing from typical oasis, whose fertility depends on water obtained from springs, the cultivated land in the Faiyum is formed of Nile mud brought down by the Bahr Yussef, 24 km (15 miles) in length. Between the beginning of Bahr Yussef at El-Lahun to its end at the city of Faiyum, several canals branch off to irrigate the Faiyum Governorate. The drainage water flows into Lake Moeris.
Over 1,000 km² (400 mile²) of the Faiyum Oasis is cultivated, the chief crops being cereals and cotton. The completion of the Aswan Low Dam ensured a fuller supply of water, which enabled 20,000 acres (80 km²) of land, previously unirrigated and untaxed, to be brought under cultivation in the three years 1903-1905. Three crops are obtained in twenty months. The province is noted for its figs and grapes of exceptional quality. Olives are also cultivated. Rose trees are very numerous, and most of the attar of roses of Egypt is manufactured in the province. Faiyum also possesses an excellent breed of sheep.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Chart Show Channels, Music video networks in the United Kingdom, Television channels and stations established in 2006

Bliss is a British music television channel owned and operated by CSC Media Group (formerly Chart Show Channels). It launched in March 2006 and has been advertised as Total Chill-out Classics. The channel plays classic pop songs and music from the 70's, 80's and 90's, along with hours dedicated to love songs and power ballads. Everyday for three hours at 9am and 7pm, there is a weekly themed slot, such as Blissful Divas, music from female artists, or Bliss at The Movies, music from films. These themed slots change every Monday.
Throughout the year the channel has days dedicated to boy bands, love songs and other types of music depending on dates such as Valentines Day. The channel also shows some newer music videos which fit in with its chill-out theme.
For the channel's original on-screen look, the Bliss logo was a gold colour with a shine moving across it every few seconds. The logo was placed in the bottom left-hand corner during music videos and the song information was shown in a gold coloured bar at the start and near the end of each music video. The channel's identity was also seen before and after advert breaks when the Bliss logo slowly came out of an opening flower.
During 2008, Bliss received a new look, with its logo changing to plain white lettering with 'BLISS' in capitals. The song information now appears in a cloud type graphic which forms in the middle of the screen. As of May 2010, the song information appeared at the bottom of the screen. The logo is also seen before and after advert breaks when a growing flower or flying butterfly goes across the screen, revealing the Bliss logo behind it.
The channel replaced another music channel called The Amp because it failed to reach a wide enough audience.
Bliss is available 24 hours a day on Sky channel 376 and is part of a bouquet of music channels owned by CSC Media.
On 12 May 2008, a +1 timeshift channel called Bliss +1 was launched. It was available 24 hours a day on Sky channel 363. On 2 June 2008, Bliss +1 was closed to make way for a 24 hour stream for AnimeCentral, a channel also owned by CSC Media Group. This allowed Pop Girl, which used to time-share with AnimeCentral, to extend its hours to 24 hours a day.
On 3 March 2008, the Bliss website was launched. The website includes TV listings, music videos, news, competitions and an online community area. Several programmes on Bliss make use of the website, for example welovebliss.com is a programme which plays the most requested songs, as voted for on the Bliss website. Throughout November and December, Bliss becomes "Blissmas" and is a Christmas music channel and it plays mostly Christmas music 24/7.
On 1 February 2011, Bliss launched on the free-to-air satellite platform Freesat on channel 517. It moved to channel 506 on 13 September 2012.
On March 2014, the channel was renamed as 21st Century Bliss.

Iceland was Christianised in approximately 1000 AD. In Icelandic, this event is known as the kristnitaka (literally, "the taking of Christianity").
The earliest Christian observance in the country in all likelihood began with the arrival of the first settlers during the settlement of Iceland in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. Some of them were from the British Isles and had adopted Christianity through their contact with the Irish. However, the vast majority of the initial settlers were pagan, worshipping the Æsir (the Norse gods), and organized Christian observance probably died out within a generation or so.

The African moon moth (Argema mimosae) is a giant silk moth of the Family Saturniidae. Similar in appearance to the giant Madagascan moon moth (Argema mittrei), but smaller, this moth can be found widely in Eastern Africa and more locally in Southern Africa, including near the east coast of South Africa. An adult can measure [tpl]convert|10|to|12|cm|in[/tpl] across its wingspan and [tpl]convert|12|to|14|cm|in[/tpl] from head to the tip of its elongated 'tail-like' second pair of wings. Its forward wings have a distinctive grey-coloured 'furry' leading edge, giving a very rough surface, presumably for aerodynamic reasons. Apart from the eye-like markings on its wings, the colouring and shape of the wings give the appearance of a piece of foliage, especially the 'tail-like' structures of the rearmost wings which resemble a dried out leaf stem - presumably for camouflage in its natural environment.

[[STO-nG basis sets]]
CATEGORIES: Quantum chemistry

where
The values of c1, c2, c3, α1, α2 and α3 have to be determined. For the STO-nG basis sets, they are obtained by making a least squares fit of the three Gaussian orbitals to the single Slater-type orbitals. This differs from the more common procedure where the criteria often used is to choose the coefficients (c's) and exponents (α's) to give the lowest energy with some appropriate method for some appropriate molecule. A special feature of this basis set is that common exponents are used for orbitals in the same shell (e.g. 2s and 2p) as this allows more efficient computation.
The fit between the Gaussian orbitals and the Slater orbital is good for all values of r, except for very small values near to the nucleus. The Slater orbital has a cusp at the nucleus, while Gaussian orbitals are flat at the nucleus.Chemical Modeling From Atoms to Liquids, Alan Hinchliffe, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 1999. pg 294.Molecular  Modelling, Andrew R.

He has a short entry in Scores and Biographies which states that he was a shoemaker by trade and resided mostly at Littlebourne, near Canterbury.  In his later years he lived in the city of Canterbury itself and was buried in Westgate cemetery.
Pilcher's career spanned the 1787 to 1796 seasons and he made 32 known appearances in major matches.

CATEGORIES: Living people, American businesspeople

William H. Seippel is a successful business executive, turnaround specialist, and company founder. He is also an active donor, with primary support efforts going to George Mason University and Make a Wish Foundation.
During 25 plus years of financial and operational experience, Seippel has successfully negotiated more than 20 acquisitions during his career. In addition, he has played a leading role in structuring complex transactions that raised $5 billion in capital, two of which received the prestigious Institutional Investor Deal of the Year award. One of these transactions included the launching of the first Euro denominated bond for the first European fiber loop, Hermes Europe Railtel. Seippel also listed three companies on the NASDAQ; two of them involved initial public offerings.
Seippel currently serves as founder, chief executive officer and chairman of WorthPoint Corporation, the leading global resource for valuation and associated services for art, antiques, and collectibles. Worthpoint is Seippel's first startup, and it appears to be on its way to becoming the Bloomberg of the world's antiques and collectibles industry. WorthPoint was ranked number 505 on the Inc. list of companies in 2013, #36 in consumer product goods and #17 for growth in Metro Atlanta.
Prior to founding WorthPoint, Seippel served as chief financial officer of MIVA; vice president and chief financial officer for AirGate PCS; chief financial officer and chief operating officer for Digital Commerce Corporation; chief financial officer for Global Telesystems Groups; and chief financial officer for Landmark Graphics Corporation. In addition, he has served as a consultant to various boards of directors on mergers and acquisitions, as well as on strategic business and financial planning.
Seippel also is known for the 2004 IRS tax shelter controversy and subsequent case Seippel v. Jenkens & Gilchrist against the Sidley Austin Brown & Wood law firm. In this action, Seippel was successful in demonstrating that the defendants misrepresented the nature of the tax product they sold to him (the Cobra tax strategy in 1999). Subsequently, Seippel prepared to file suit against the IRS for attempting to wrongfully impose excessive interest and penalties against him, but the IRS withdrew its action and the suit was never filed.
Seippel has a master’s degree in business administration from American University. He received a bachelor’s degree in science from George Mason University, where he currently serves as chairman of the advisory board for the School of Management. He received the Business School's Alumni of the Year award in 2009.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS199341+30-Apr-2009+BW20090430 | work=Reuters | title=Will Seippel Receives George Mason University School of Management Distinguished Alumnus Award | date=2009-04-30[/tpl]

[[Tuxedo Brass Band]]
CATEGORIES: Musical groups from New Orleans, Louisiana, Brass bands from New Orleans, Louisiana

The Tuxedo Brass Band, sometimes called the Original Tuxedo Brass Band, was one of the most highly regarded brass bands of New Orleans, Louisiana in the 1910s and 1920s.
It was led by Papa Celestin starting about 1910.  Many noted jazz greats played in the band.  The group never recorded (though the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band, a dance band using some of the same musicians, did record in the mid-1920s). 
Personnel varied; as with most such New Orleans brass bands of the era, a group no larger than three trumpets or cornets, two trombones, one or two clarinets, alto horn, baritone horn, bass horn, snare drum, and bass drum considered sufficient for most jobs. The team of Papa Celestin playing a driving lead, Manuel Perez with sweet variations and Joe Oliver's hot bluesy counter melodies was remembered by many musicians of the era as the finest brass band trumpet team heard in the city.
Other notables who played in the band included Louis Armstrong, Peter Bocage,  Mutt Carey,  Louis Dumaine, Eddie Atkins, Harrison Barnes, Sunny Henry, Jim Robinson, John Casimir, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone, Alphonse Picou, George Guesnon, Isidore Barbarin, Louis Keppard, Chinee Foster, Black Benny Williams, and Zutty Singleton.
A group of younger musicians formed the Young Tuxedo Brass Band, which is still in existence.

The company experienced rapid growth in the 1980s, was heavily endorsed and marketed by various celebrities, and was marketed via over 140,000 distributors. However, an expose by NBC revealed fraudulent practices, and this was followed by multiple lawsuits from attorneys general in three different states.

CATEGORIES: Cartilaginous fish, Devonian fish, Carboniferous fish, Permian fish, Chimaeriformes

Bradyodonti is an order of cartilaginous fishes (class Chondrichthyes) that lived in the Paleozoic Era.  They first appeared toward the end of the Devonian Period, were present through the Carboniferous Period, and became extinct by the end of the Permian Period.
Most Bradyodonti fossils consist of jaws and teeth.  These indicate that Bradyodonti ate mollusks and other shelled invertebrates.  Their bodies were probably broad and flattened, like modern rays.
"Bradyodonti" can also refer to the present-day Chimaera or ratfish of the order Chimaeriformes, which have an upper jaw fused to the braincase and a flap of skin covering the gill slits.

[[Expert elicitation]]
CATEGORIES: Scientific method

In science, engineering, and research, expert elicitation is the synthesis of opinions of authorities of a subject where there is uncertainty due to insufficient data or when such data is unattainable because of physical constraints or lack of resources.  Expert elicitation is essentially a scientific consensus methodology.  It is often used in the study of rare events.  Expert elicitation allows for parameterization, an "educated guess", for the respective topic under study.  Expert elicitation generally quantifies uncertainty.
Expert elicitation tends to be multidisciplinary as well as interdisciplinary, with practically universal applicability, and is used in a broad range of fields.  Prominent recent expert elicitation applications are to climate change, modeling seismic hazard and damage, association of tornado damage to wind speed in developing the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and risk analysis for nuclear waste storage.

A board-certified family physician, Dr. Hill began his professional career in the rural Mississippi Delta where he practiced for 27 years. In addition to his full-service family practice, Dr. Hill developed and directed a local maternal child health program that resulted in lowering the fetal mortality rate from one of the highest in the United States to below the national average, where it remained. Due to his wealth of medical practice experience and recognition as a role model for young doctors, Dr. Hill was asked in January 1995 to become the director of the Family Practice Residency Program at North Mississippi Medical Center, which is the nation’s largest rural hospital. Having stepped down from the directorship in July 2001, he remains on the faculty full-time and has an active practice.

SmartDrive (or SMARTDRV) was a disk caching program shipped with MS-DOS versions 4.01 through 6.22 and Windows 3.0 through Windows 3.11.[tpl]cite web|title=SMARTDrive Version History (Revision 2.1)|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/127021|work=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=7 July 2005[/tpl] It improved data transfer rates by storing frequently accessed data in random-access memory (RAM).[tpl]cite web|title=SMARTDrive and 32-Bit Disk Access (revision 1.1)|url=http://support.microsoft.com/?id=83325|work=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=16 November 2006[/tpl]
Early versions of SmartDrive were loaded through a CONFIG.SYS device driver named SMARTDRV.SYS. Versions 4.0 and later were loaded through an executable file named SMARTDRV.EXE, which could be run at user's discretion or at boot time via AUTOEXEC.BAT. However, SMARTDRV.EXE also includes double-buffering driver that should be loaded through CONFIG.SYS. Version 4.0 also introduced 32-bit disk access and could reduce its footprint in conventional memory (the first 640 kilobytes of memory which was critical to MS-DOS) by running in upper memory area (the 384 kilobytes of memory located beyond the conventional memory).
A cloaked variant of SmartDrive utilizing the Helix Cloaking API was available from Helix Software. On Intel 80386 processors, it could run in protected mode to reduce its footprint in conventional memory.
Microsoft suggests SmartDrive to be used when installing Windows 2000 or Windows XP from MS-DOS to reduce installation time.[tpl]cite web|title=How to start the Setup program from MS-DOS in Windows XP (revision 6.0)|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307848|work=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=22 May 2013[/tpl]

[[NTU method]]

CATEGORIES: Heat transfer

The Number of Transfer Units (NTU) Method is used to calculate the rate of heat transfer in heat exchangers (especially counter current exchangers) when there is insufficient information to calculate the Log-Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD). In heat exchanger analysis, if the fluid inlet and outlet temperatures are specified or can be determined by simple energy balance, the LMTD method can be used; but when these temperatures are not available The NTU or The Effectiveness method is used.
A quantity:
The effectiveness(E), is the ratio between the actual heat transfer rate and the maximum possible heat transfer rate:
where:
Effectiveness is dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1. If we know E for a particular heat exchanger, and we know the inlet conditions of the two flow streams we can calculate the amount of heat being transferred between the fluids by:
For any heat exchanger it can be shown that:
For example, the effectiveness of a parallel flow heat exchanger is calculated with:
Or the effectiveness of a counter-current flow heat exchanger is calculated with:
Similar effectiveness relationships can be derived for concentric tube heat exchangers and shell and tube heat exchangers. These relationships are differentiated from one another depending on the type of the flow (counter-current, concurrent, or cross flow), the number of passes (in shell and tube exchangers) and whether a flow stream is mixed or unmixed.

Leguía, a boating enthusiast, got the idea for a carbon fiber cello in 1989 from hearing the waves resonate against his catamaran. He proceeded to spend five years in his basement developing and refining the process. By 1991 he had built three cellos, each progressively better than the last. However, he wanted his cellos to be even better, so he turned to carbon fiber expert Steve Clark, the head of Rhode Island's Vanguard Sailboats. Clark eventually would lead Leguía to Dunham, with whom he would establish the manufacturing agreement which exists today.
The strength of the carbon fiber allows for a removal of the cornices of the instrument, thereby improving the sound. In addition, the instruments are immune to changes in weather, and highly resistant to damage.  They are designed to be held closer to the body in order to reduce fatigue, a result of less material used in the instruments' creation.[tpl]cite web | title= Luis and Clark - The Instruments | publisher = Luis and Clark | url= http://www.luisandclark.com/theinstruments.php | accessdate = 2007-05-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070306112304/http://www.luisandclark.com/theinstruments.php  |archivedate = 2007-03-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = United States Patent 6,284,957 | publisher = Patent Storm | date = 2001-09-04 | url = http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6284957-fulltext.html | accessdate = 2009-03-25 [/tpl]

One of the stages of the 1995 Giro del Trentino went to Innsbruck in neighbouring Austria, and stages to and from Lienz in Austria have remained a regular feature of the race since that time.
The short, sharp courses typical of the Giro del Trentino, full of steep climbs, are seen as a good proving ground for the aspirants of the Giro d'Italia which usually starts a few days after the Giro del Trentino concludes. Several Giro del Trentino winners have won the Giro d'Italia including Francesco Moser, Gilberto Simoni, Paolo Savoldelli and Damiano Cunego.

Its authors were the prominent scholars Zeng Gongliang (曾公亮), Ding Du (丁度) and Yang Weide (楊惟德), whose writing influenced many later Chinese military writers. The book covered a wide range of subjects, everything from naval  warships to different types of catapults. Although the English philosopher and friar Roger Bacon was the first Westerner to mention the sole ingredients of gunpowder in 1267 (i.e. strictly saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal) when referring to firecrackers in "various parts of the world", the Wujing Zongyao was the first book in history to record the written formulas for gunpowder solutions containing saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal, along with many added ingredients.Ebrey, 138. It also described an early form of the compass (using thermoremanence), and had the oldest illustration of a Chinese Greek Fire flamethrower with a double-acting two-piston cylinder-pump that shot a continuous blast of flame.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 83

Frederick Percy Hardy, born at Blandford Forum, Dorset on 26 June 1880, and died at King's Cross railway station, London, on 9 March 1916, was a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Somerset. 
Hardy was a left-handed batsman who sometimes opened the innings and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He played for Surrey's colts team, but left to join Somerset. He made his debut in 1902 and in his second match took the slip catch that dismissed Victor Trumper for just five – Trumper was dismissed a second time for five by the same bowler, Gill, later in the match. 
Hardy played as a professional in a mainly amateur team, and made fairly regular appearances for Somerset right through to 1914. In 1910, when the side lost 15 out of 18 County Championship matches and failed to secure a single point all season, he headed the Somerset batting figures with 700 runs, including his own highest score of 91 against the champions, Kent, at Taunton. His best bowling figures, six for 82, also came in that season, against Middlesex at Bath. 
Hardy's death is something of a mystery. He was, in the words of Wisden's 1917 edition, "found dead on the floor of a lavatory at King's Cross station (G.N.R.)... His throat was cut and a blood-stained knife was by his side."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228031.html|title=Other deaths in 1916|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|publisher=John Wisden & Co.|accessdate=22 December 2009[/tpl] Hardy was serving with the City of London Yeomanry at the time.

Shaking the dust from the feet was a practice of pious Jews during New Testament times.  When Jesus called his twelve disciples, he told them to perform the same act against the non-believing Jews. 
In the early Latter Day Saint movement of the 19th century, it was practiced much as recorded in the New Testament, but later fell out of use. Other Christian groups and organizations typically do not see this as a practice that should be followed, or as something not to be taken literally.

The East Harlem Purple Gang was a semi-independent group of Italian American hit-men and heroin  dealers who according to Federal prosecutors dominated heroin distribution in East Harlem and the Bronx during the late 1970s in New York City. The gang was originally affiliated with the Lucchese crime family and later with the Bonanno crime family and Genovese crime family, and its remnants are now part of the 116th Street Crew.[tpl]sfn|Kappersetter|2007[/tpl] They allegedly named their group the 'Purple Gang' as a tribute to a Prohibition Era gang (Purple Gang) that terrorized Detroit 50 years earlier.[tpl]sfn|Blum|1977[/tpl] Membership in the group was restricted to Italian Americans who grew up on Pleasant Avenue[tpl]sfn|Blum|1977[/tpl] between 114th and 120th streets, just east of 1st avenue, also known as Italian Harlem.[tpl]sfn|Kilgannon|Malliozzi|2004[/tpl]
In 1977, at the peak of its strength, The Purple Gang had 30 members according to police reports and 80 associates.[tpl]sfn|Blum|1977[/tpl] After the arrest of Leroy Barnes, the top heroin dealer in Harlem, the Purple Gang began supplying heroin to his network of African-American dealers in Harlem at $75,000 per kilogram. In 1977, law enforcement claimed that the Purple Gang committed at least 17 homicides, some on behalf of 'organized crime principals'.[tpl]sfn|Blum|1977[/tpl]
Law enforcement speculated that during the late 1970s, the Purple Gang developed a relationship with Nicaraguan drug dealers, trading firearms for drugs.[tpl]sfn|Blum|1977[/tpl]
The Purple Gang disintegrated during the late 1970s and was absorbed into the current 116th Street Crew. Some members were invited to join the Mafia and became made men, including Angelo Prisco and Daniel Leo[tpl]sfn|Capeci|2006[/tpl] who became the acting boss of the Genovese crime family in 2005.[tpl]sfn|Capeci|2007[/tpl]

Cross played most of his career in Philadelphia, where he was the starting shortstop for the Philadelphia Phillies from [tpl]by|1898[/tpl] until [tpl]by|1900[/tpl].

CATEGORIES: SAP NetWeaver

The SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure ("NWDI") combines the characteristics and advantages of local development environments – as usually provided in a Java environment – with a server-based development landscape that centrally provides a consistent development environment to development teams and supports the software development through the entire lifecycle of a product.
The Developer Infrastructure mimics the functionality of ABAP Change and Transport System (CTS). The aim is to control deployment of components in the system landscape in a standardized manner. NWDI can be used to import Business Packages from SAP and enables development teams to modify standard applications.
SAP NWDI is also known as SAP JDI (Java Development Infrastructure). The latter term is considered to be obsolete.

[[SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer]]

CATEGORIES: Web applications, SAP NetWeaver, Specification languages, Workflow technology

SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer is SAP’s graphical software modelling tool. This web-based application enables business process experts and developers to quickly create business application components, without coding.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/visualcomposer |title=SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer on SDN[/tpl]
Visual Composer produces applications in a declarative form, thereby enabling completely code-free execution mode for multiple runtime environments. It provides full application lifecycle support by maintaining the connection between an application and its model throughout its lifecycle. Visual Composer is designed with an open architecture, which enables developers to extend its design-time environment and modelling language, as well as to integrate external data services.
As a result, Visual Composer modelers increase productivity by reducing their development effort time from weeks and months to days. Domain experts gain the means to express their requirements directly rather than conveying them to developers. This narrows the gap between application definition and implementation.
Starting with a blank canvas, the Visual Composer user draws the application in Visual Composer Storyboard (workspace), without writing a single line of code. Since no traditional programming skills are needed, business process experts can prototype, design and produce entire applications.
A typical workflow for creating, deploying and running an application using Visual Composer is:
Create a model
Edit the layout
Deploy the model
Run the application

CATEGORIES: Software companies based in Virginia

The Imagists Group is a software company started in Burke, Virginia, in the bedroom of Clarence Bowman came at the end of the computer boom in 1987.
Their first title to be published was Clash: Ethereal for the Atari 800 computer. While it was critically well received, its sales were doomed by the ever-dwindling prices of 8-bit computers and the flourishing of more expensive 16-bit machines.
The Imagists Group was disbanded in 1989 due to poor sales and the dwindling 8-bit market. An Apple II version was also in the works, but development was halted earlier in the year because of a quickly shrinking market space.  The company had planned to make the transition to the newly released Macintosh computer, but the team had all moved in different directions and reforming the group proved impossible.
It was an important piece of software because it was a prime example of how great products can be produced at the end of a hardware life cycle and be quickly killed by the death of an industry.  It also signaled the last days of the garage-startup company, where a handful of people could create an entire company and a single programmer could produce a complete product.  Because of the new level of sophistication of hardware, it was requiring more and more people to launch products in a timely manner.
Clarence Bowman, President and Founder, went on to attend the University of Utah before becoming a full-time graphic designer and artist. He is currently working on several small projects, one of which is called mimmsy.com which helps users find content and manage their Netflix™ Instant Watch video queue.

Accessed June 7, 2012.
thumb|Long Branch BeachElberon was a beach resort community in the late 18th century. In the 19th century it was a "Hollywood" of the east, where some of the greatest theatrical and other performers of the day gathered and performed. It was visited by presidents Chester A. Arthur, James Garfield, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford Hayes,  William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson.(2006) The Year in Review, The Long Branch Historical Association, Page 1. Seven Presidents Park, a park near the beach, is named in honor of their visits. 
The Church of the Presidents, where all seven worshiped, is the only structure left in Long Branch associated with them. The church was built in 1879, designed by New York architects William Appleton Potter and Robert Henderson Robertson.
President James A. Garfield was brought to Long Branch in the hope that the fresh air and quiet in Elberon might aid his recovery after being shot on July 2, 1881, an incident that left the assassin's bullet lodged in his spine. He died here on September 19, 1881, exactly two months before his 50th birthday.Sharkey, Joe. "The Great Boardwalk Towns of Jersey", The New York Times, August 4, 1991. Accessed July 10, 2007. "Along the 125-mile stretch of Jersey seashore, the northernmost of the Great Boardwalk Towns is Asbury Park, a resort that developed in the late 1800s as an alternative to its then vice-ridden neighbor, Long Branch, the town where President James Garfield died from gunshot wounds and thus became the first, but by no means only, local habitue to be dispatched at the hand of a disappointed office seeker." The Garfield Tea House, built from railroad ties that carried Garfield's train, is in Elberon.

CATEGORIES: Footpaths in Hampshire, Rail trails in England, Long-distance footpaths in England

The Meon Valley Railway Line is a [tpl]convert|17.5|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] recreational footpath and cyclepath in Hampshire, England.Accessible countryside
The trail follows part of the bed of the former Meon Valley Railway (Alton to Fareham), which closed in 1968. It ends at West Meon due to removal of the former viaduct across the Meon Valley, and the presence of tunnels further north.
The section from West Meon south to the Eastleigh to Fareham line is open to walkers, cyclists and horse riders and uses existing public bridleways and some newly created permissive bridleways.
The route from West Meon to Wickham to  is [tpl]convert|14.5|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]; the further 3 kilometre section south-west of Wickham is a dead end.
There are free car parks at West Meon (off Station Road) and at Wickham (also off Station Road).  There are also pay car parks in West Walk (part of the Forest of Bere).
The route is level but can be muddy in places. The northern section emerges from the cutting south of West Meon onto an embankment which gives views of Old Winchester Hill to the east and Beacon Hill to the west. A few former bridges on the route have been dismantled, necessitating descent to cross minor roads. There is access at several points along the route including Meonstoke which has a pub and shop. The current temporary South Downs Way route crosses the trail to the east of Exton with an access point. Ironically the bridge by which the Monarch's Way crosses the trail east of Warnford is intact with no access, but the trail can be joined by a short diversion along the South Downs Way.
Various circular routes are possible, for example using the trail from West Meon to Meonstoke, taking the South Downs Way via Corhampton and Beacon Hill, and Monarch's way to Warnford, returning by local footpaths.
The A32 main road follows a similar route to the trail.

The Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (ACAA) is Title 49, Section 41705 of the U.S. Code. The Act prohibits commercial airlines from discriminating against passengers with disabilities. The act was passed by the U.S. Congress in direct response to a narrow interpretation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) v. Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA). In PVA, the Supreme Court held that private, commercial air carriers are not liable under Section 504 because they are not "direct recipients" of federal funding to airports.
The Act was construed to contain an implied private right of action. However, in 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Alexander v. Sandoval,532 U.S. 275 (2001) which held that federal courts may not find an implied private right unless a statute gives explicit indication that Congress intended to bestow such a right. In 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit followed the lead of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which relied on the Sandoval decision to hold that the Act can only be enforced by filing an administrative complaint with the DOT.Boswell v. SkyWest Airlines, Inc., 361 F.3d 1263 (10th Cir. 2004) and Love v. Delta Air Lines, 310 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir. 2002)

[[AOG desk]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft maintenance

An AOG desk is a dedicated aviation logistics service. The principal aim of AOG desk personnel is to obtain the supply of components  or services for aircraft in an AOG (“aircraft on ground”) situation (i.e., in emergency situations where aircraft are grounded due to technical failures) in the shortest possible time. Every airline has an AOG desk—a vital requirement to reduce technical delays. It is estimated that an AOG can cost an airline $150,000 per hour.Boeing Commercial Airplanes Operations Center Nearly every supplier in the aviation industry (OEM, distributors, parts dealers, and brokers) also maintains an AOG Desk to service calls from airlines searching for critical parts. 
The term "AOG" is universally recognized throughout the airline/aviation industries. Due to the exorbitant cost of an AOG situation, it is common practice for competitive airlines to mutually support each other (sharing spare parts, tools & manpower)to minimize the duration and domino effect that can occur if an aircraft operator is required to provision their own resources.

[[Dew point depression]]
CATEGORIES: Atmospheric thermodynamics, Severe weather and convection

The dew point depression (T-Td) is the difference between the temperature and dew point temperature at a certain height in the atmosphere.  
The smaller the difference, the more moisture there is, and the higher the relative humidity. In the lower troposphere, more moisture (small dew point depression) results in lower cloud bases and lifted condensation levels (LCL). LCL height is an important factor modulating severe thunderstorms. One example concerns tornadogenesis, with tornadoes most likely if the dew point depression is 20 °F (11 °C) or less, and the likelihood of large, intense tornadoes increasing as dew point depression decreases. LCL height also factors in downburst and microburst activity. Conversely, instability is increased when there is a mid-level dry layer (large dew point depression) known as a "dry punch", which is favorable for convection if the lower layer is buoyant. 
As it measures moisture content in the atmosphere, the dew point depression is also an important indicator in agricultural and forest meteorology, particularly in predicting wildfires.

Czechoslovak Legion of 1939 was formed in Second Polish Republic after Germany occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939. While about 4,000 Czechs and Slovaks joined the French Foreign Legion, about a 1,000 chose to go to Poland, which looked likely to be involved in hostilities with Germany in the near future, and which gave permission for a formation of a dedicated Czechoslovak unit, in tradition of the First World War Czechoslovak Legions. The Legion had a strength of about 700 soldiers, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Ludvík Svoboda; about 200 flying personnel were instead assigned to a Czechoslovak Reconnaissance Squadron. The ground Legion was however not fully formed by the time of German invasion of Poland on 1 September. Most of the soldiers were eventually interned by the invading Soviets on 17 September, while others crossed the Polish-Romanian border and were interned in Romania. The Reconnaissance Squadron was involved in the fight in the air alongside the Polish Air Force, although primarily in the reconnaissance role, as the aircraft they received from Poland (Potez XXV, RWD-8 and PWS-26), were mostly obsolete in air combat.

William D. "Billy" Shindle (December 5, 1860 – June 3, 1936) was a third baseman in Major League Baseball who played from [tpl]By|1886[/tpl] through [tpl]By|1898[/tpl] for the Detroit Wolverines (1886–87), Baltimore Orioles (1888–89, 1892–93), Philadelphia Athletics (1890), Philadelphia Phillies (1891), and the Brooklyn Grooms & Bridegrooms (1894–98). Shindle batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Gloucester, New Jersey. He was slightly built at [tpl]height|ft=5|in=8[/tpl] and 158 pounds.  
Shindle's Range factor of 4.34 in 1892 for the Baltimore Orioles is the highest rating ever recorded by a third baseman in the history of Major League Baseball.  See Range factor.  He also had Range factors over 4.0 for Baltimore in 1888, for Philadelphia in 1891. 
While his Range factor demonstrates his superior speed and ability to get to the ball, Shindle was not as talented at handling the balls once he got to them.  In 1890, Shindle played shortstop for Philadelphia in the Players League and was charged with 122 errors (119 at shortstop and 3 at third base).  Shindle's 122 errors in 1890 is the all-time record for most errors by a major league player at any position.Deficient defenders: many players have earned reputations as "good hit, no field" performers - descriptions of play of baseball players | Baseball Digest | Find Articles at BN... at findarticles.com 
Shindle was ranked as the 95th best third baseman of all time in The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.
In a 13-season career, Shindle was a .269 hitter (1561-for-5807) in 1422 games, with 31 home runs, 355 extra base hits, 992 runs, 758 RBI, 226 doubles, 97 triples, and 318 stolen bases.  In 1890 (the same year he set the all time errors record), Shindle batted a career-high .322, led the Players League with 282 total bases, and was fourth in the league with 10 home runs. 
Shindle played third base for the Brooklyn Bridegrooms from 1894 to 1898.  His 3.7 lifetime Range factor makes him the number one defensive third baseman in Dodgers history.  (William F. McNeil, "The Dodgers Encyclopedia," p. 102)  
In 1894, the 34-year-old Shindle hit .296 with 94 runs scored and 96 RBIs.  He retired after the 1898 season at age 38.
Shindle died in Lakeland, New Jersey at age 75.

[[Convective condensation level]]
CATEGORIES: Severe weather and convection, Atmospheric thermodynamics

The convective condensation level (CCL) represents the height where an air parcel becomes saturated when lifted adiabatically to achieve buoyant ascent.
It marks where cloud base begins when air is heated from below to the convective temperature, without mechanical lift. Can be roughly approximated by taking the spread between the surface temperature and dewpoint and dividing by 4.4 (if temperatures are in °F) or 2.5 (if temperatures are in °C), then multiplying the result by 1000.

[[Lambert Hitchcock]]

CATEGORIES: 1795 births, 1852 deaths, American businesspeople, American cabinetmakers, People from Connecticut

Lambert Hitchcock (May 28, 1795, Cheshire, Connecticut – 1852) was an American furniture manufacturer,David Lander "Last Seating: America's Best-Known Chair Is on the Brink of Extinction" American Heritage, Oct. 2006. famous for designing and mass-producing the Hitchcock chair.
Hitchcock was the son of John Lee Hitchcock, an American Revolutionary War veteran who was lost at sea in 1811.  He attended the Episcopal Academy of Cheshire, now known as Cheshire Academy, and was an apprentice to woodworker Silas Cheney.  In 1818, he opened a furniture factory in Riverton, Connecticut, then called Hitchcocksville.  The factory at first made chair parts.  Soon Hitchcock, influenced by Connecticut clockmaker Eli Terry, began mass-producing simple, affordable chairs.  Instead of painting designs on the backs, he used the relatively new and easier technique of stenciling.  By the late 1820s, the Hitchcock Chair Company was producing over 15,000 chairs a year.
Although an innovative manufacturer, Hitchcock was an unsuccessful businessman.  His company went through receivership in 1832, with his brothers-in-law joining the business under the name Hitchcock, Alford & Co.  In 1843, he sold his interest in the company and started a new company in Unionville, Connecticut, which also failed.  He died in 1852 with little money to his name.
In 1946, John Tarrant Kenney came upon the abandoned Hitchcock Chair factory while fishing on the Farmington River.  He wrote a biography, The Hitchcock Chair, and started a new Hitchcock Chair Company in the same location.  That business lasted until 2006, when it was forced to close due to competition from low-cost overseas furniture manufacturers. In the spring of 2010, Rick Swenson and his business partner, Gary Hath, purchased the Hitchcock name, plans, and artwork. Their goal is to continue the Hitchcock legacy, bringing Hitchcock furniture into the 21st century while maintaining the quality and integrity of Lambert Hitchcock's original dream.

The shrub-ox (Euceratherium collinum) is an extinct genus and species of Bovidae native to North America.
Euceratherium was one of the first bovids to enter North America. It appeared on this continent during the early Pleistocene, long before the first bison arrived from Eurasia. It went extinct about 11,500 years ago. 
Late Pleistocene shrub-ox remains are known from fossil finds spanning from northern California to central Mexico. In the East they were distributed at least into Illinois.

[[Lake Saka Nature Reserve Area]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Turkey

The Saka Gölü Nature Reserve Area is a nature reserve area in Kırklareli Province of Turkey near the small coast town of İğneada on the Black Sea Coast. It gets its name from the Saka Lake which is in the boundaries of the area. Its area is 1345 ha. The area sits on a floodplain of a river that flows into the Black Sea and seasonally floods thus rendering it a unique and one of the very few remaining floodplain forests in all of Europe. The flora consists of oak forests (typical of the Yıldız mountains located in the vicinity of the area), ash, alder, elm, maple and hornbeam trees. There are also wide stretches of pristine coastal area with several endemic plants, some of which are halophytes (salt-loving), and wetlands dominated by reeds which harbor different bird species.

[[Choke ring antenna]]
CATEGORIES: Radio frequency antenna types

 thumb|Choke ring antenna at a DGPS Reference Station 
A choke ring antenna is a particular form of omnidirectional antenna for use at high frequencies.  It consists of a number of conductive concentric cylinders around a central antenna.  Due to its delicate construction, it is often enclosed in a protective cover or radome when placed outside and exposed to the elements.  
Choke ring antennas are notable for their ability to reject multipath signals fading from a source.  Since the path that a signal takes from a transmitter to receiver can be used to measure the distance between the two, this makes it highly suited for GPS and radar applications.  In a GPS ground based receiver, a choke ring antenna can provide millimeter precision measurementshttp://www.trimble.com/infrastructure/gnss-choke-ring-antenna.aspx - Catalog page for a Trimble choke ring antenna. for surveying and geological measurement applications.
The choke ring design originated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.http://www.javad.com/jns/technology/Single-Depth%20Low-Multipath%20Choke%20Ring.html - A basic description of choke ring antenna benefits and limitations.

Ireland by contrast endured one of their worst championships of the period, losing all three games and failing to score. Scotland too underperformed, although their two losses were both hard fought.
Scotland had kicked off the competition with an easy victory over Ireland in the first match. England and Wales by contrast split the points, failing to breach a 1–1 draw at Ninian Park. England exerted their authority over the Irish in their second game with a simple win, whilst Wales performed the impressive feat of beating Scotland on their home turf with a hard-won 1–0 success. The final games were tensely contested, as Wales, hoping for an England failure at Hampden Park in their final game took the play to the Irish and ran out 3–0 winners. In Glasgow between England and Scotland, the tournament was decided by two Stan Pearson goals which gave England the victory and their half of the trophy. Had goal difference been used at this time to further separate the teams, then Wales would have won a rare individual victory, but this method of scoring was not introduced to the British Home Championship until the Seventies.

[[Yellowcard discography]]

CATEGORIES: Discographies of American artists, Pop music group discographies, Rock music group discographies

The discography of Yellowcard, an American pop punk band from Jacksonville, Florida, consists of nine studio albums, eleven singles, two live albums, two extended plays, one video album, and two compilation albums.
Yellowcard released their debut album, Midget Tossing, on April 1, 1997, via DIY Records. This album, along with their next two albums, Where We Stand (1999) and One for the Kids (2001), failed to garner any chart success on the Billboard music charts. Also, no singles were ever released from any of these albums.
However, in 2003, they achieved success with the release of Ocean Avenue. The album charted within the Top 30 of the Billboard 200, as well as the Top 10 in New Zealand. The album's title track was a Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 single. This single, along with the follow-up single, "Only One", was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album was then certified Platinum in the US by July 2004.
Their fifth album, Lights and Sounds (2006), was an even bigger success on the Billboard 200, peaking within the Top 5. While not charting a Top 40 single on the Hot 100, the album's title track reached #50 on the chart, as well as becoming their highest chart entry on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart. They then released Paper Walls in 2007 before taking a two-year hiatus in 2008. They reformed in 2010 and released When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes on March 22, 2011. Their latest album, Southern Air, was released on August 14, 2012, which features the single "Always Summer".

[[Kveim test]]
CATEGORIES: Skin tests

The Kveim test, Nickerson-Kveim or Kveim-Siltzbach test is a skin test used to detect sarcoidosis, where part of a spleen from a patient with known sarcoidosis is injected into the skin of a patient suspected to have the disease. If non caseating granulomas are found (4–6 weeks later), the test is positive. If the patient has been on treatment (e.g. glucocorticoids), the test may be false negative. The test is not commonly performed, and in the UK no substrate has been available since 1996. There is a concern that certain infections, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, could be transferred through a Kveim test.[tpl]GPnotebook|-389021680[/tpl]
It is named for the Norwegian pathologist Morten Ansgar Kveim, who first reported the test in 1941 using lymph node tissue from sarcoidosis patients.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kveim MA|title=En ny og spesifikk kutan-reaksjon ved Boecks sarcoid.

May be used for Rickettsia, coccidioidomycosis, though numerous sources of interferences (e.g., large immune complexes and high protein concentrations) lessen the utility of the latex agglutination (LA) test in most situations. There is an excellent LA test for cryptococcus.Howanitz and Howanitz, Laboratory Medicine. Published by Church Livingston; 1991: pp 825–828 It also is used in definitive diagnosis of Group A streptococcus.
In a latex fixation test, a sample is mixed with latex beads coated with antibodies. If the antigen is present, it will react with the antibodies causing the latex beads to clump.http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/003334.htm

Giuseppe Bianchini (1704 in Verona – 1764 in Rome) was an Italian Oratorian, biblical, historical, and liturgical scholar. Clement XII and Benedict XIV, who highly appreciated his learning, entrusted him with several scientific labors. Bianchini had contemplated a large work on the texts of the Bible, Vindiciae Canonicarum Scripturarum Vulgatae latinae editionis, which was to comprise several volumes, but only the first, in which, among other things, are to be found fragments of the Hexapla (cod. Chisianus), was published (Rome, 1740). Much more important is his Evangeliarium quadruplex latinae versionis antiquae, etc., 2 vols. (Rome, 1749). Among his historical works may be mentioned the fourth volume which Bianchini added to the publication of his uncle, Francesco Bianchini, Anastasii bibliothecarii Vitae Rom. Pontif. (Rome, 1735); he also published the Demonstratio historiae ecclesiasticae quadripartitae (Rome, 1752–54). The chief liturgical work of Bianchini is Liturgia antiqua hispanica, gothica, isidoriana, mozarabica, toletana mixta (Rome, 1746). He also undertook the edition of the works of B. Thomasius (Tomasi), but only one volume was issued (Rome, 1741).Giuseppe Bianchini
In addition he investigated and wrote an account of the reported spontaneous combustion of the Countess Cornelia Zangari (Verona, 1731, later republished at Rome)."Countess Cornelia di Bandi's Fiery Death"Bianchini, G. (1743) Parere sopra la Cagione della morte della Comtessa Cornelia Zangari, ne' Bandi Casenate; 3a ediz. Roma: Ottavio Puccinelli
Bianchini examined and described many of biblical manuscripts housed in Italy, such as: Minuscule 145, 169, 170, 171, 173, 174, 175, 176, 178, 179, 180, 196, 394, 397, 450, 627, 632, Lectionary 35, Lectionary 46, Lectionary 123, Lectionary 124, Lectionary 125, Lectionary 126, Lectionary 127, Codex Cyprius, Codex Angelicus, Codex Campianus, Codex Vaticanus 2066, Codex Curiensis, Codex Corbeiensis I, Codex Corbeiensis II, Codex Sangermanensis I.

MD 367 connects U.S. Route 113 (US 113) with Bishopville and other small communities on the St. Martin Neck in northern Worcester County.  The state highway was constructed between Bishop and Bishopville in two steps in the mid-1920s and early 1930s, respectively.  The segment within Bishopville was constructed as part of an extended MD 368 in the mid-1910s.  The portion from Bishopville to the Delaware state line was constructed in the mid-1930s as MD 568.  All three state highways were reassigned to their present lengths in 1950.

James Leonard Vincent "Len" Johnson (1905–1966) was an American scientist.
"Len" Johnson was an American engineer, designer, and scientist in the mid-twentieth century in the field of metallurgy and nuclear technology. He was one of the first Irish Catholics to break into the exclusive field of design engineering for the Department of Defense.
Len Johnson was born in Freeland, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania in 1905. Though from an Irish family, Len was actually the 4th generation in the US.  His great grandfather had immigrated from Moneyneana, County Londonderry, Ulster, Ireland in 1839, prior to the great Irish Famine.  However, his roots in Pennsylvania and in America went back to the early 1700s.
The first member of his family to come to America was, Sir William Johnson (McShane) who originally came to the colony of New York in 1720.  He managed his uncles properties and eventually created his own estate called Johnstown (town), New York.  William rose to prominence in the French and Indian War as the Commissioner of the Iroquois tribe.  He created and led an army of Indian and settler soldiers at various battles rising to the rank of Major General in the British army in America.  The  Battle of Lake George in 1755 earned him a baronet title and his capture of Fort Niagara with his Indian troops defeating the French army made him, "Johnson of New York".  It is still an active baronetcy within the family.  His grandmother was Ada "Mary" Wilson.  Her family had been originally come to the US in the 1750s as Quakers outside Philadelphia.  Len had an early grandfather, Captain Joseph Greene, who commanded the Northumberland County Ranger company at the close of the American Revolution in 1782, and had served in the York County militia from as early as 1777.  Through his grandmother he was also a close cousin to President Woodrow Wilson.
His grandfather John was a collier engineer in Freeland, Pennsylvania, and his uncle, Captain Patrick Johnson, was an officer in the 116th Infantry Regiment of Pennsylvania, of the Irish Brigade and had fought at the Wheatfield at Gettysburg.  Both were regionally famous musicians.  His father, John Joseph "Jack" Johnson was the first Irish boss of the huge Cox Coal Company. It is estimated that Jack Johnson directed over 1000 workers on a day-to-day basis spanning six major installations to include a railroad. As a young man he was selected to be the first Irish boss and was educated by the company. After his formal education he was placed in charge of the entire field. That position allowed his son, Len, to enter into the prestigious Mining and Mechanical Institute (now MMI Preparatory School) from which he was graduated in 1922.
From there, Len became the first of his family to attend college. He chose to attend Pennsylvania State College (now University) and graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1926.  What to do after graduation proved to be a difficult decision to make in that he was offered a job with the professional baseball team system, the St. Louis Browns.  He was a particularly good 2nd baseman and was playing semi-professional baseball at the time for the Allentown Dukes.  However, he chose to go into engineering full-time, returning to the coal fields and went to work for Bethlehem Steel company through the 1920s.  Len's work with new casting designs brought him greater attention and was eventually notice by U.S. Steel.  In the 1930s he was hired and went to work for a US Steel affiliate, the National Tube works in Lorain, Ohio and then to McKeesport, Pennsylvania, where he became the General Manager of the entire plant.  While there he wrote numerous articles on the advancements of steel use in the defense industry.  He stayed until the late 1930s when he rose to become a designer of new steel products, leading the transition away from casting to the use of rolled steel.

[[Terra Nivium]]

CATEGORIES: Geological features on the Moon

Terra Nivium (Latin for "Land of Snows") is a roughly triangular highland region on the Moon. In his Almagestum novum, the notable selenographer Giovanni Riccioli named the various highland regions terrae. However, unlike his naming scheme for craters and lunar maria, his nomenclature for the continental areas of the Moon never came into common use.
It lies to the north of the Mare Vaporum and is bounded along the northwest by the rugged Montes Apenninus range, and to the northeast by the less impressive Montes Haemus mountains. Portions of this area have been penetrated by flows of magma that connect to the Mare Vaporum.
This irregular area contains a number of smaller depressions that have become covered in flows of basaltic lavas. These form what are essentially miniature lunar maria. They are clustered near the southern borders of the area, and fill much of the terrain between Mare Vaporum and the Montes Haemus. These mare-like features are generally irregular in shape, and many are joined together through gaps between the more rugged islands of continental terrain.
These areas are listed in the table below, ordered from west to east. The listed diameter corresponds to the smallest circle that fully contains the feature.

Shop right, in United States patent law, is an implied license under which a firm may use a patented invention, invented by an employee who was working within the scope of their employment, using the firms' equipment, or inventing at the firms' expense. Even if the employee never assigned rights to the firm, a court of law may find that the firm has the right to make use of the invention, and thus can not be sued by the employee for patent infringement.  This will allow the firm to attempt to capitalize on the value of the patent, as the firm is allowed to use the object of the patent in the routine operation of its business without royalty payments. Shop right is non-transferable. It only inures to the benefit of the employer and can not be sold by that employer to an unrelated party, except in a sale of the business as a whole.

The Khorumi ([tpl]lang-ka|ხორუმი[/tpl]) is a war dance that originated in the region of Adjara, which is located in the southwestern region of Georgia. The dance was originally performed by only a few men. However, over time it has grown in scale. In today’s version of the Khorumi, thirty or forty dancers can participate. 
Although the number of performers changed, the content of the dance is still the same. The dance brings to life the Georgian army of the past centuries. A few men who are searching the area for a campsite and enemy camps perform the initial "prelude" to the dance. Afterwords, they call the army onto the battlefield. The exit of the army is quite breathtaking. Its strength, simple but distinctive movements and the precision of lines create a sense of awe on stage. The dance incorporates in itself the themes of search, war, and the celebration of victory as well as courage and glory of Georgian soldiers. Since Georgia has seen many wars throughout its history, Khorumi is a call from the past and reminds us that in order to have peace, we must be ready for war.

Henry Liu (1936 – December 1, 2009[ref]
</ref> ) was a retired American [[civil engineer]] and the president of Freight Pipeline Company (FPC), now known as EcologicTech. 
Liu earned his PhD in civil engineering from Colorado State University with research on fluid mechanics, and then worked as a professor of civil engineering at University of Missouri (MU) in Columbia, Missouri for over 20 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2009/12/02/inventor-and-retired-mu-professor-died-crash-tuesday/ |title=Inventor and retired MU professor Henry Liu died in crash Tuesday |publisher=Columbia Missourian |date=2 February 2009[/tpl] At MU, he was also director of the Capsule Pipeline Research Center, a joint state/industry initiative funded by the National Science Foundation to develop capsule pipeline technology to transport freight; an innovative application of pipelines to transfer solids instead of fluids.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.capsu.org/library/documents/0026.html |title=Facts About Pneumatic Capsule Pipeline (FAQ) |publisher=Capsu.org |accessdate=2011-08-26[/tpl]
In 2001, after his retirement, Liu founded FPC, the company which developed a new type of fly ash brick, a building brick made from a waste by-product of coal power plants, using an environmentally sustainable manufacturing process.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.green-buildings.com/content/781642-fly-ash-brick-machine |title=Fly Ash Brick: What's the Best Way to Manufacture it? |publisher=Green-Buildings.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26[/tpl]
Liu had spent most of his working career compressing industrial freight using hydraulic presses. In 1999, he was given some fly ash by a client, and decided to compress it "just to see what would come out." Liu mixed the fly ash with water and applied 4,000 psi (28 MPa) of pressure. After two weeks, he found that the mixture had set into blocks with the strength of concrete. Owing to the high concentration of calcium oxide in fly ash, the bricks can be described as "self-cementing".
Liu used a National Science Foundation grant of $600,000 to perfect the manufacturing technique over an eight-year period,[ref]
National Science Foundation, Press Release 07-058, "Follow the 'Green' Brick Road?", May 22, 2007[/ref] discovering that by adding an air entrainment agent, which generates microscopic bubbles in the hardened brick that better accommodate the expansion of freezing water, he was able to produce a brick which could withstand over 100 freeze-thaw cycles, thereby comfortably meeting US federal safety standards.
Since the manufacturing method uses a waste by-product rather than clay, and solidification takes place under pressure rather than heat, it offers has several environmental benefits. It saves energy, reduces mercury pollution, alleviates the need for landfill disposal of fly ash, and costs 20% less than traditional methods. The bricks are now manufactured under license by Calstar Products in California.

[[Please Understand Me]]

CATEGORIES: Psychology books, Books about introversion

Please Understand Me: Character and Temperament Types is a psychology book written by David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates which focuses on the classification and categorization of personality types. The book contains a self-assessed personality questionnaire, known as the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, which links human behaviourial patterns to four temperaments and sixteen character types. Once the reader's personality type has been ascertained, there are detailed profiles which describe the characteristics of that type.
Based upon the notion that peoples' values differ fundamentally from one another, Keirsey drew upon the views of several psychologists or psychiatrists: Ernst Kretschmer Erich Adickes, Alfred Adler, Carl Jung and Isabel Myers who are all mentioned as predecessors in the psychology of temperament or personality.Please Understand Me, pp.3-4 Of these methods, preference is given to the Myers-Briggs test when determining personality type.Please Understand Me, p.4

Marcel Eugène Émile Gley ([tpl]IPA-fr|glɛ|lang[/tpl]; 1857–1930) was a French physiologist and endocrinologist born in Épinal, Vosges.
He studied physiology with Henri-Étienne Beaunis in Nancy medicine school, and afterwards worked as assistant to Étienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904) in Paris. Later he received the title of professeur agrégé, and in 1908 became a professor at the Collège de France. He was a member of the Académie de Médecine and secretary general of the Société de Biologie. He was a colleague to Charles Richet (1850-1935), and with Richet published the Journal de physiologie et de pathologie générale.
In 1891 Gley was the first to discover the importance of the parathyroid glands, which are four (or more) small endocrine glands lying close or embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. These glands had been recently discovered as an anatomical entity in 1880, however their importance was not understood at the time. Gley realized that the cause of tetany after thyroid operations was the inadvertent destruction of the parathyroid glands. He demonstrated this by removing the parathyroid glands from laboratory animals and witnessing their deaths from tetany. Because of his discovery, parathyroid glands have sometimes been referred to as "Gley's glands".
In his studies of the thyroid, he discovered that there was much more iodine in thyroid tissue than in the parathyroid, and noticed that when the thyroid is removed, a disturbance of iodine metabolism occurs.Handbook of Pharmacology by Charles Wilson Green (1914)

Piatt's best year was 1999 when he won the triple crown and minor league player of the year award at 3rd base. He was forced into becoming an outfielder because of the A's present third baseman, Eric Chavez, and that was the only opening on the A's. He hit .299 in 60 games in 2000 with 5 home runs and 5 triples. In 2001, he got viral meningitis, but fortunately survived. He was designated for assignment by the A's in August 2003 and was claimed off waivers by Tampa Bay. In 2004, he went to Cleveland, but retired before the season.
Piatt was once featured in a commercial for K-Swiss shoes.
In the Mitchell Report, Piatt admitted to having used steroids. He also claimed to have sold testosterone or Deca-Durabolin, along with human growth hormone to then Oakland teammate Miguel Tejada. He never saw Tejada actually use any substances. Piatt had checks from Tejada published in the Mitchell Report dated from 2003 for $3,100 and $3,200. Piatt said that former A's teammate F. P. Santangelo had told him about a guy who could give Piatt HGH. Piatt (who was trying to come back from viral meningitis) received HGH and testosterone from Kirk Radomski and used them in the 2002-2003 offseason. After using them he said he "did not love the game when he used them" and that he had learned a life lesson. Piatt told all of this to Mitchell during their meeting. 
In June 2009, Piatt was charged with possession of marijuana not more than 20 grams and or use of narcotic equipment, DUI and DUI with property damage in Cape Coral, Florida.

[[Coals to Newcastle]]

CATEGORIES: Culture in Newcastle upon Tyne, British English idioms, History of Newcastle upon Tyne, Clichés

Selling, carrying, bringing, or taking coal(s) to Newcastle is an idiom of British origin describing a foolhardy or pointless action."Newcastle upon Tyne", Encyclopædia Britannica 
It refers to the fact that historically, the economy of Newcastle upon Tyne in north-eastern England was heavily dependent on the distribution and sale of coal—by the time of the first known recording of the phrase in 1538,"Early Coal Mining 1100- 1500", The Northern Echo's History Pages"Newcastle timeline", Newcastle University 15,000 tonnes of coal were being exported annually from the area"Early Coal Mining", Terry McKinney, Pitwork.net—and therefore any attempt to sell coal to Newcastle would be doomed to failure because of the economic principle of supply and demand. The phrase "To carry Coals to Newcastle" is first documented in North America in 1679  in William Fitzhugh's letters ("But relating farther to you would be carrying Coals to new Castle")Bartlett Jere Whiting Early American Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases  1977 - Page 76 "To carry Coals to Newcastle 1679 Fitzhugh Letters 67: But relating farther to you would be carrying Coals to new Castle. 1768 Habersham Letters 68: He asked, if I wanted to carry Coals" and first appears in a printed title in Labour in vain: or Coals to Newcastle: A sermon to the people of Queen-Hith, 1709.
Timothy Dexter, an American entrepreneur, succeeded in defying the idiom in the eighteenth century. Renowned for his eccentricity and widely regarded as a buffoon, he was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to Newcastle by rival merchants plotting to ruin him. However, he instead got a large profit after his cargo arrived during a miners' strike which had crippled local production.[tpl]cite book | last = Knapp | first = Samuel L. | title = Life of Lord Timothy Dexter: Embracing sketches of the eccentric characters that composed his associates, including "Dexter's Pickle for the knowing ones" | publisher = J.E.

More prosaically, the American National Coal Association asserted that the United States profitably sold coal to Newcastle in the early 1990s,"U.S. Beats The Price Of Coal In Newcastle", William Flannery, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, May 10, 1990 and 70,000 tonnes of low-sulphur coal was imported by Alcan from Russia in 2004 for their local aluminium smelting plant. However, this was when Newcastle's traditional coal industry had stagnated so much by the end of the twentieth century that the last exports from the area were six years before Alcan's venture."Taking coals to Newcastle - it finally happens", The Northern Echo, August 5, 2004
Although the coal industry of Newcastle has declined in its relative importance to the city since its historic heyday, the expression can still be used today with a degree of literal accuracy, since the harbour of Newcastle in Australia (named for Newcastle in the UK after abundant coal deposits were discovered there and exploited by early European settlers[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/new-south-wales/newcastle/2005/02/17/1108500198331.html|title=Newcastle|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2004-02-08|accessdate=2008-09-24[/tpl]) has succeeded its UK namesake by becoming the largest exporter of coal in the modern world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newportcorp.com.au/client_images/612898.pdf|title=New Trade Record for Newcastle Port|work=Media releases|format=PDF|author=Minister For Ports And Waterways|coauthors=Minister For Regulatory Reform, Minister For Small Business|publisher=Newcastle Port Corporation|date=6 August 2008|accessdate=2008-11-01[/tpl]
With the increasing onset of globalization, parallels in other industries are being found, and the idiom is now frequently used by the media when reporting business ventures whose success may initially appear just as unlikely. It has been referred to in coverage of the export to India of Saudi Arabian saffron and chicken tikka masala from the United Kingdom,"The Next Asian Journey: Shadows of Old Araby", TIME, vol.158, no.7/8, August 20, 2001"Chicken tikka masala: Spice and easy does it", BBC News, April 20, 2001 the sale of Scottish pizzas to Italy,"Selling coals to Newcastle? How about pizzas to Italy? Cosmo Pasta Co. to sell gluten-free pizzas in Italy", Nation's Restaurant News, July 7, 2003 the flowing of champagne and cheese from Britain to the French,"Lovely firm beats French at their own game", The Journal, January 27, 2006"French Kiss-Off", Daily Mirror, May 3, 2007 and the production of manga versions of William Shakespeare from Cambridge for Japan."Putting the art in the wherefore art", Cambridge Evening News, May 2, 2007
Even though its original geographic origin may have been displaced, this cliché continues to be used.[tpl]cite web |first1=Michael |last1=Quinion |authorlink=Michael Quinion |work=World Wide Words |url=http://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/1583485-755-1-feedback-notes-and-comments |title=Coals to Newcastle |accessdate=20 October 2013[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Endocrine neoplasia, Adrenal gland disorders

The term adrenal tumor or adrenal mass can refer to one of several benign and malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland, several of which are notable for their tendency to overproduce endocrine hormones. Adrenal cancer specifically refers to malignant adrenal tumors, which include neuroblastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and a minority of adrenal pheochromocytomas. Most adrenal pheochromocytomas and all adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors, which do not metastasize or invade nearby tissues, but which may still cause significant health problems by giving rise to hormonal imbalances.

CATEGORIES: Politics of France

The  ''cumul des mandats''  (literally: "accumulation of mandates") is the French equivalent of the dual mandate in other countries. It is a political practice particularly common in France, in comparison to other Western countries.At the time Pierre Mauroy was prime minister (1981–84), he kept his job as mayor of Lille, one of France's largest cities, without anyone objecting. France has had legions of députés-maires, sénateurs-maires and ministres-maires. It consists of holding two or more elective offices at different levels of government — local, regional, national and European — as mayors, MPs, senators, Members of the European Parliament, and President of the General Council in their home regions.[tpl]cite book| last=Gidea |first=Robert |year=2002 |title=France since 1945 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-219246-9 |page=240 [/tpl]  Sometimes, officials hold as many as four positions.[tpl]cite book |last=Nadeau |first=Jean-Benoît |coauthors=Julie Barlow |title=Sixty million Frenchmen can't be wrong: why we love France but not the French |year= 2003|publisher=Sourcebooks |location=Naperville, Illinois |isbn=1-4022-0045-5 |page=56 [/tpl] While officials may not be elected to more than one office at the same level (such as being both an MP and a senator), they may hold offices in any combination at the municipal, departmental, regional, national and European levels.
The cumul des mandats is controversial in France, being accused of fostering absenteeism and cronyism.

An Arthurian story, it was collected by Francis James Child as Child Ballad 30. Unlike other Child Ballads, but like the Arthurian "The Boy and the Mantle" and "The Marriage of Sir Gawain", it is not a folk ballad but a professional minstrel's song.Child, p. 298. It is notable for containing the Green Knight, a character known from the medieval poems The Greene Knight and the more famous Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; he appears as "Bredbeddle", the character's name in The Greene Knight.

It is uncertain whether F. calocera is native to Madagascar or was introduced to the island from Asia. Throughout much of its expanded range F. calocera is now considered an invasive species.  It colonizes ruderal sites along transport routes and can become dominant in habitats disturbed by human activity.  Mycologists fear that it may be displacing native fungi species as it spreads through the paleotropics.

[[Midlakes High School]]

CATEGORIES: Public high schools in New York, Schools in Ontario County, New York

Midlakes High School is the only high school (9-12) in the Phelps-Clifton Springs Central School District in Ontario County, New York.  The high school services all of the town of Phelps and village of Clifton Springs, and parts of the towns of Manchester, Seneca, Geneva, and Hopewell.
The school has around 700 students at around 150 per graduating class.  It offers six Advanced Placement courses: Calculus AB, Physics, Biology, US History, Language, and Literature. 
The school's sports teams are called the "Screamed Eagles" with Black, Blue and White Colors. They are in Section V. 
In terms of extracurricular activities, the theater program is especially acclaimed, which is led by Keith Childs! Athletically, the Boys Volleyball and Boys Track teams coached by Kyle Salisbury and Carl Spoto respectively have won recent sectional titles. The Volleyball team has recently won sectional titles in 2006 and 2007. The basketball team won a Section V title in the '08-'09 season. The Cheerleading Team has won sectional titles in 2010 in their winter and fall seasons, and a title in the 2011 winter season.
The Midlakes School District is also famous for the tradition of the Christmas Pickle. Which is regarded as one of the strangest modern Christmas customs in the United States.
In the 1880s the great great grandfather of Nick Nima, Bucky Nima started selling glass ornaments imported from Germany all in the shape of a pickle. Around the same time it was claimed that the Christmas Pickle was a very old Phelps tradition and that the pickle was the last ornament hung on the Christmas tree and then the first child to find the pickle got an extra present. However, this seems to be somewhat of a myth since not many people in Phelps have heard of the Christmas Pickle.However there are two other rather far-fetched stories linking the Phelps Pickle to Christmas.
One features a fighter in the American Civil War who was born in Clifton Springs. He was a prisoner, and starving, he begged a guard for one last pickle before he died. The guard took pity on him and gave a pickle to him and the pickle gave him the mental and physical strength to live on.
The other story is linked to the Landschoots (a family in the Midlakes area). It's a tale of two Phelps boys traveling home from a boarding school for the holidays. When they stopped at an Phelps Hotel for the night, the evil innkeeper, killed the boys and put them in a pickle barrel. That evening, Archibald Landschoot stopped at the same inn, and found the boys in the barrel and miraculously bought them back to life.
The American city of Clifton Springs (also known as the Christmas Pickle Capital of the World) has an annual pickle festival held during the early part of December.

BBC Sessions is a compilation album featuring studio sessions and a live concert recorded by English rock group Led Zeppelin for the BBC. It was released on 11 November 1997, by Atlantic Records. This was the first release of new Led Zeppelin material in seven years. Disc 1 consists of material from four different 1969 BBC sessions.

Alice Domon, Caty, (born 1937, Charquemont, Doubs, France; disappeared on December 17 or 18, 1977 near Santa Teresita by the Argentine Sea) was a Roman Catholic nun from France who was one of two French nationals to be "disappeared" in December 1977 in Argentina during the military dictatorship of the "National Reorganization Process" (1976–1983). She was among a dozen people associated with the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group, who were kidnapped and taken to the secret detention center at ESMA.
According to witnesses who saw her there, over a period of about 10 days, she was interrogated and tortured, forced to write a letter claiming participation in guerrilla group opposing the government, and photographed in a staged setting in front of a Montoneros banner (this photo was released to the press). That group of detainees, including Sister Léonie Duquet, was "transferred", a euphemism for being taken out and killed. Domon's remains have never been found.
Bodies began to wash up on beaches south of Buenos Aires in December 1977. They were quickly buried in mass graves. A March 1978 Agence France-Presse article reported that the bodies of the missing two French nuns and others associated with the Mothers were believed to have been among them.
In 2000, a small plaza in Buenos Aires was named "Hermana Alice Domon y Hermana Leonie Duquet," in honor of the sisters. Their lives are celebrated in an annual commemoration at the Santa Cruz church of San Cristobal, where they had worked, and where the remains of Duquet and several Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo are buried.
In 2011, Alfredo Astiz, who had infiltrated the Mothers of the Plaza and organized the abduction of the twelve in December 1977, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for that and other crimes against humanity. For his torturing at ESMA, he had been nicknamed "The Blond Angel of Death."

In art and archaeology, in sculpture as well as in painting, a register is a vertical level in a work that consists of several levels, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines; modern comic books typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. 
Common examples are from Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs as decoration scenes, on objects.
Luwian language hieroglyphs were also represented in stone art, in registers. Another example, in Mesopotamian art, would be the stones called Kudurru, or boundary stones, which often had registers of gods on the upper registers of the scenes.

[[Conrad, Margrave of Meissen]]

CATEGORIES: House of Wettin, Margraves of Meissen, Christians of the Wendish Crusade, 1097 births, 1157 deaths

Conrad the Great ([tpl]circa|1097[/tpl] – 5 February 1157) was the Margrave of Meissen from 1123 until his retirement in 1156. He was the son of Thimo, Count of Brehna, of the House of Wettin and Ida, daughter of Otto of Nordheim. He was also Count of Wettin, Brehna, and Camburg from before 1116.
In 1123, he became Count of Eilenburg. That same year, Lothair of Supplinburg, Duke of Saxony, appointed him Margrave of Meissen in opposition to Wiprecht von Groitzsch, the appointee of the Emperor Henry V. Lothair also named Albert the Bear Margrave of Lusatia, while Henry named Wiprecht to that march also. Wiprecht was unable to hold his own against his two opponents and in 1124 Conrad was securely in power in Meissen. In 1136, Lothair, then emperor, appointed him to Lusatia as well. Thereafter, Upper Lusatia remained a part of Meissen and the march of Lusatia was reduced to Lower Lusatia alone.
In 1143, Conrad became Count of Groitzsch and Rochlitz and Vogt of Chemnitz and Naumburg. In 1147, while Conrad III of Germany was away on the Second Crusade, Conrad the Great joined Henry the Lion, Adalbert of Salzwedel, Albert the Bear, and the Archbishops of Magdeburg and Bremen to organise a Crusade against the Obodrites and Wagri. In August, Conrad and Albert, with the bishops of Magdeburg, Havelburg, and Brandenburg, massed their forces at Magdeburg. The Obodrite prince Niklot and his fortressess of Dubin and Dimin were besieged. Both he and Pribislav, another Obodrite prince, were forced to accept Christianity and make peace.
In the following years, he founded the monastery of St Peter auf dem Lauterberg (Petersberg), to which he retired on 30 November 1156. He died and was buried there next to his wife, Luitgard (Lucarda) of Elchingen-Ravenstein, daughter of Adalbert, Count of Elchingen-Ravenstein and Bertha of Hohenstaufen, daughter of Frederick I, Duke of Swabia and Agnes of Germany.

[[Fanny Imlay]]
CATEGORIES: 1794 births, 1816 deaths, English people of American descent, French people of English descent, French people of American descent, Female suicides, Drug-related suicides in Wales, People from Le Havre, People from London

Frances "Fanny" Imlay (14 May 1794 – 9 October 1816), also known as Fanny Godwin and Frances Wollstonecraft, was the illegitimate daughter of the British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and the American commercial speculator Gilbert Imlay. Fanny's mother wrote about her frequently in her later works, and Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a poem on her death. Fanny grew up in the household of Radical philosopher William Godwin, and her half-sister Mary later wrote Frankenstein and married Shelley, a leading Romantic poet. The Godwin and Shelley families have been the subject of intense academic and popular interest, which includes Fanny; although by the time of her suicide at the age of 22, she had not achieved anything of note.
Although Gilbert Imlay and Mary Wollstonecraft lived together happily for brief periods before and after the birth of Fanny, he left Wollstonecraft in France in the midst of the French Revolution. In an attempt to revive their relationship, Wollstonecraft travelled to Scandinavia on business for him, taking the one-year-old Fanny with her, but the affair never rekindled. After falling in love with and marrying the philosopher William Godwin, Wollstonecraft died soon after giving birth in 1797, leaving the three-year-old Fanny in the hands of Godwin, along with the newborn Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (the future author of Frankenstein).
Four years later, Godwin remarried and his new wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, brought two children of her own into the marriage, most significantly—from Fanny Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective—Claire Clairmont. Wollstonecraft's daughters resented the new Mrs Godwin and the attention she paid to her own daughter. The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1814. Fanny, left behind, bore the brunt of her stepfather's anger. She became increasingly isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816.

CATEGORIES: 1910 births, 1998 deaths, Yoruba traditional rulers, Nigerian royalty

Sir Olateru Olagbegi II, Olowo of Owo, Kt (born August 1910 - 1998) was the King (Olowo) of Owo, an ancient city which was once the capital of an Eastern Yoruba city state in Nigeria.Robin Poynor, 'Naturalism and Abstraction in Owo Masks', African Arts, Vol. 20, No. 4  (Aug., 1987)
He was appointed Olowo in 1941 and ruled for 25 years before he was deposed. His exile from power was a fallout of a regional crisis between two Action Group leaders: Awolowo and Samuel Ladoke Akintola.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] The Action Group which was launched in his palace a decade earlier, was led by Awolowo in the 1950s. A battle of wills between the two gladiators in the early 1960s saw Oba Olateru pitching his tent with Akintola. 
However, his choice only fomented tension in his community. A military coup in 1966 created an avenue for some citizens of Owo to unleash violence and revolt against Olagbegi. He was banished from power in 1966 by the military administrator of the Western Region. 
In 1993, he was re-appointed to his former title of Olowo after the death of the reigning monarch.Bamidele Johnson, "Exit Of A Two-Time Monarch," Tempo. November 12, 1998Bamidele Adebayo, "Bloody Throne," The News (Lagos). September 27, 1999
He was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 1960.London Gazette http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/42051/supplements/3974
He  died in October 1998 and crown passed to his son Oba Folagbade Olagbegi III.

[[The Graceful Fallen Mango]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 debut albums, Dirty Projectors albums

The Graceful Fallen Mango is the first album by experimental rock band Dirty Projectors. However, it was released under head Projector Dave Longstreth's name. The album is a collection of tunes recorded in Longstreth's bedroom on a 4-track machine and in his brother's basement on a computer. Dave Longstreth plays everything on the album save for some back-up vocals on two tracks, which were sung by his brother Jake and a person only identified as Steve in the liner notes. Musically, the songs range from straightforward acoustic tunes, to hard rock songs and experimental instrumentals. A small discrepancy in the title of the album exists, since the graceful-fallen mango is written on one side of the CD's spine and THE GRACEFUL FALLEN MANGO is written on the other. Western Vinyl shows the title as the latter, following normal capitalization rules.

As with many other IMARO members of the time, historians from the Republic of Macedonia consider him an ethnic Macedonian,Му ставивме споменик, не му го најдовме гробот whereas historians in Bulgaria consider him a Bulgarian.Makedonsko Delo, 93-94 edition, 1929 However such Macedonian activists, who came from the  IMARO and the IMRO (United) never managed to get rid of their strong pro-Bulgarian bias.Palmer, S. and R.

He was born in Veles (then known by the name Köprülü) where he graduated from Bulgarian Exarchate's school. Brashnarov graduated from the Bulgarian pedagogical school in Skopje.

In 1908 he joined the People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section). In 1903-1913 Brashnarov worked as Bulgarian teacher. In 1914-1915 he completed a two-year higher educational course in Plovdiv. He was mobilized in the Bulgarian army during the First World War and participated in the battles of Doiran. In 1919, he joined the Yugoslav Communist Party. In 1925 in Vienna, Brashnarov was elected as one of the leaders of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United).Размисли върху революцията в Европа, Красимир Узунов, Център за изследване на демокрацията, 1992, София, стр. 74. Because of his political convictions, he was sentenced to seven years in prison in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. After his release he remained politically passive.

Then he became politically active again and joined the Communist partizan's movement fighting against the Axis Powers. On 2 August 1944, the Antifascist assembly of the national liberation of Macedonia took place at the St. Prohor Pčinjski monastery. Brashnarov served as the first speaker.Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies, Roumen Dontchev Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, BRILL, 2013, ISBN 900425076X, p. 328. The modern Macedonian state was officially proclaimed as a federal state within Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia, receiving recognition from the Allies.
From the start of the new Yugoslavia, the authorities organised frequent purges and trials of Macedonian communists and non-party people were charged with autonomist deviation. Many of the former left-wing IMRO government officials were purged from their positions, then isolated, arrested, imprisoned or executed on various (in many cases fabricated) charges including pro-Bulgarian leanings, demands for greater or complete independence of Yugoslav Macedonia, collaboration with the Cominform after the Tito-Stalin split in 1948, forming of conspirative political groups or organisations, demands for greater democracy and the like. In 1948, being fully disappointed by the policy of the authorities, Brashnarov complained of it in letters to Joseph Stalin and to Georgi Dimitrov. He did so together with Pavel Shatev. As a result, he was arrested in 1950 and imprisoned in Goli Otok labor camp where he died the following year.Goli Otok: The Island of Death: a Diary in Letters, Venko Markovski, Social Science Monographs, Boulder, 1984, ISBN 0880330554, р. 42.

[[William's Doll]]

CATEGORIES: American children's books, Children's picture books, 1972 books, Children's fiction books

William's Doll is a 1972 children's picture book by Charlotte Zolotow about a boy who wants a doll even though dolls typically are considered a toy only for girls. His father, uncomfortable with William's request, tries giving William toys the father considers more gender-appropriate, such as a basketball and a train set; while William enjoys these toys, he continues to ask for a doll. Eventually, the boy's grandmother fulfills the request, explaining to the father that William will use the doll to practice being a good father.
Zolotow has explained that although she is a feminist and appreciates that many feminists enjoyed the book's message, her inspiration was more from personal observations about her husband's early attempts to bond with the couple's son, Stephen, and about how men of the time period missed out on some of the pleasures of being closely involved with their children's development. She observed, for example, that by always exiting the room during diaper changes, her husband missed their son's first smile.Charlotte Zolotow on the origins of William's Doll, charlottezolotow.com (retrieved June 1, 2007)
The book often is used in the United States for lessons on gender roles, stereotypes, or general anti-bias education. For example, the journal article "'William's Doll' Revisited" was on a study comparing reactions of fourth-grade students in 1975 and in 2000.[tpl]cite journal |last=Greever |first=Ellen A. |last2=Austin |first2=Patricia |last3=Welhousen |first3=Karyn |date=March 2000 |title='William's Doll' Revisited |journal=Language Arts |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=324–30 |format=PDF |issn=0360-9170 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |url=http://www.csun.edu/~bashforth/305_PDF/305_ME2/305_Language&Gender/WilliamsDollRevisitedAcross20Years_LA2000.pdf |laysource=Education Resources Information Center |laysummary=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ603237&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ603237 |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= [/tpl]

The Aitape–Wewak campaign was one of the final campaigns of the Pacific Theatre of World War II. Between November 1944 and the end of the war in August 1945, the Australian 6th Division, with air and naval support, fought the Imperial Japanese 18th Army in northern New Guinea. Considered a "mopping up" operation by the Australians, and although ultimately successful for them with the Japanese forces cleared from the coastal areas and driven inland, amidst difficult jungle conditions, casualties from combat and disease were high. With Japan on the verge of defeat, such casualties later led to the strategic necessity of the campaign being called into question.

[[Piazza Barberini]]

CATEGORIES: Piazzas in Rome, House of Barberini

Piazza Barberini is a large piazza in the centro storico or city center of Rome, Italy and situated on the Quirinal Hill. It was created in the 16th century but many of the surrounding buildings have subsequently been rebuilt.
The current appellation was given in 1625 when it was named after the Palazzo Barberini, the substantial Baroque palace built in an elevated position on the south side of the piazza for the Barberini. Originally, there was a large entrance gateway to the palace designed by the Baroque painter and architect Pietro da Cortona on the south east corner of the piazza but this was demolished to make way for the construction of a new road in the nineteenth century. However, its appearance is known from engravings and early photographs of the piazza For early views of the piazza see Rome in Early Photographs 1846–1878. Photographs from the Roman and Danish Collections. Trans. Ann Thornton. Thorvaldsen Museum, Copenhagen, 1977, plates 59–64 
At the centre of the piazza is the Fontana del Tritone or Triton Fountain (1642–3) sculpted by Bernini. Another fountain, the Fontana delle Api (1627–1629), also by Bernini is in the nearby Via Vittorio Veneto but it has been reconstructed somewhat arbitrarily following its removal from its previous position on the corner of a palace where the Piazza Barberini meets the Via Sistina.Blunt, Anthony. Guide to Baroque Rome , Granada, 1982, p.230  
Until the 18th century, unknown human corpses were displayed here for public identification. Between 1632 and 1822 an antique obelisk stood here but has been transferred to Villa Medici.

Shirley Temple, The Youngest, Most Sacred Monster of the Cinema in Her Time (or Shirley Temple, The Youngest, Most Sacred Monster of Contemporary Cinema), also known as the Barcelona Sphinx Dali catalogue (accessed 1 June 2007) is a 1939 artwork in gouache, pastel and collage on cardboard, by surrealist painter Salvador Dalí. It measures 75 cm x 100 cm (29.5 inches x 39.5 inches). It is housed in the Netherlands, at Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam's principal art gallery.

On top of the head is a vampire bat. Surrounding the sphinx are a human skull and other bones, suggesting her latest kill. At the bottom of the painting is a trompe-l'œil label that reads: "Shirley!. at last in Technicolor."Salvador Dalí - the first pop star of painting Tate etc (accessed 1 June 2007) The painting has been described as a satire on the sexualization of child stars by Hollywood.

[[Gus Elen]]

CATEGORIES: 1862 births, 1940 deaths, English male singers, Music hall performers

Ernest Augustus Elen (22 July 1862 – 17 February 1940) was an English music hall singer and comedian. He achieved success from 1891, performing cockney songs including "Arf a Pint of Ale", "It's a Great Big Shame", "Down the Road" and "If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses in Between" in a career lasting over thirty years.
Born in Pimlico, London, Elen had worked as a barman and a draper's assistant and had packed eggs for the Co-op before becoming a singer. He began busking at an early age and found a position singing in a minstrel troupe. His solo success began in 1891 when he started performing in public houses, singing songs in a manner similar to many cockney fruit sellers and ironmongers of the time, known as costermongers. Because of this, he became known as a "coster comedian". For the stage persona he had created, Elen dressed in a coster uniform of striped jersey, peaked cap turned towards one ear and a short clay pipe in the side of his mouth. His characters adopted a persona of being constantly bad tempered and pugnacious. In 1907 he starred in a short film called Wait Till the Work Comes Round.
In his later years, Elen was offered work in the USA due to the English music hall strike which was taking place that year. Elen, along with other comics of the day, including Albert Chevalier, performed their acts in the same manner as they did previously in the uk. However, the box-office sales indicated that Chevalier was more popular with American audiences than Elen and so he returned to the UK and performed for a further seven years as a top attraction in music halls across London. He appeared on stage occasionally in the 1930s, albeit briefly, where he appeared in the 1935 Royal Command Performance. He retired in 1914, shortly after returning from America. He made occasional appearances on stage and film before his death in 1940 aged 77.

Eliakim ben Meshullam (born about 1030; died at the end of the eleventh century in Speyer, Rhenish Bavaria) was a German rabbi, Talmudist and payyeṭan.
He studied at the yeshivot in Mainz and Worms, having Rashi as a fellow student. Eliakim himself founded a Talmudical school in Speyer. 
He wrote a commentary on all the tractates of the Talmud except Berakot and Niddah (see Solomon Luria, Responsa, No. 29, and Asher ben Jehiel, Responsa, Rule 1, § 8), which was used by scholars as late as the fourteenth century. At present there exists only the commentary on Yoma, in manuscript (Codex Munich, No. 216). 
Ritual decisions by Eliakim are mentioned by Rashi ("Pardes," 42a, 44c, 48a). He was the composer of a piyyuṭ, to be read when a circumcision takes place in the synagogue on a Saturday.

WJND-LP (100.7 FM, "MegaMix 100.7") is a low-power non-commercial radio station in Ocala, Florida. Its format is primarily Dance music, with occasional Spanish language and Christian music programming.
The station is a one-man operation, as its Program Director and DJ, James Dispoto, aka "DJ New York", runs the station from his parents' home in Ocala. FCC regulations limit non-commercial radio certificates to educational or non-profit entities; the operating certificate is actually held by Primeria Inglesia Bautista Hispanic Association, a group in the Ocala area. 
The station's location and broadcasting tower were a source of conflict between Marion County officials and Dispoto's family. The county shut down the station in the fall of 2003, citing zoning laws that prohibited the operation of a radio station in a residential neighborhood and restricted the height of any towers to 50 feet; the tower was approximately 100 feet tall. An engineer working with the Dispotos noted that James Dispoto's mother, Elaine, possesses an amateur radio operator license, and that the Federal Communications Commission requires communities to reasonably accommodate amateur radio operators. The county's response was that the station failed to secure a permit to construct the tower, and in any case, the tower was higher than required for amateur use.[tpl]cite news |work=Star-Banner |date=2004-01-02 |last=Haberlin |first=Steven Ray |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17217739_ITM |title=Ocala, Fla., Family Fights to Return Radio Station to Air |accessdate=2007-05-31[/tpl]
In November 2004, the Marion County Commission agreed to let the station continue operating from the Dispoto home as long as the transmitter was moved out of the neighborhood. A compromise was reached in which the transmitter would be moved a short distance away, to an existing tower at a landfill owned by the county.[tpl]cite news |work=Star-Banner |date=2004-11-17 |last=Heberlin |first=Steven Ray |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7189519_ITM |title=Marion County, Fla., panel gives break to low-power radio station |accessdate=2007-05-31[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Perception

Looming is a term found in the study of perception, as it relates directly to psychology.  Looming refers to the rapid expansion in the size of any given image. As the image becomes increasingly large on the perceiver's retina, i.e., when an object looms, there is an automatic physiological response to perceive the object as an approaching object or surface, instead of one that is stationary or receding. The type of mirage described as looming, in which distant objects appear much nearer than they actually are, is explained in the same way as the image of the ship, except that the image is not inverted; the density variations may also act as a magnifying glass.

Tal Shaked (born February 5, 1978 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA) is an American chess grandmaster, who is best known for winning the World Junior Championship in 1997.
Shaked learned the game at the age of seven, and developed his chess skills in the scholastic chess organizations of Tucson, Arizona. As a junior, Shaked won several national scholastic championships, including the 1987 National Primary Championship, the 1990 National Elementary Championship, the 1991 National K-8 Championship, the 1992 National K-8 Championship, the 1992 U.S. Cadet (under 16) Championship, and the 1995 U.S. Junior (under 20) Championship; he also won the 1995 National Open.Tal Shaked Chess Timeline Shaked won the Laura Aspis Prize in 1991 as the number-one rated American chess player under the age of 13, and that same year became the youngest ever winner of the Arizona State Championship.List of Aspis Winners 1980-1994  
Shaked's victory at the 1995 US Junior Championship granted him a place in the 1996 U.S. Chess Championship.  Although he was by far the youngest and lowest-rated player in the field, he surprised many by his performance, leading the tournament after eight rounds.1996 US Chess Championship  Later in 1996, Shaked received the Frank Samford fellowship, which allowed him the monetary resources to fully devote his time to chess.  Making the most of the opportunity, Shaked obtained three grandmaster norms within five months, officially attaining the title of grandmaster; it would be ten years later until another American-born player would achieve the grandmaster title.  Two months after his third norm, Shaked won the 1997 World Junior Championship, defeating top-seed and future super-grandmaster Alexander Morozevich and scoring a total of six wins and seven draws to beat out Morozevich, future FIDE world chess champion Ruslan Ponomariov and others.
As winner of the World Junior Championship, Shaked was invited to play in the super-grandmaster event in Tillburg, Holland, a field which included world champion Garry Kasparov, future world champion Vladimir Kramnik, and super-grandmasters Peter Svidler, Peter Leko, Alexei Shirov, Judit Polgár and Michael Adams.1997 Tilburg Tournament  In late 1997, Shaked competed in the FIDE World Chess Championship, winning his first round match before losing in the second round.  In 1998, Shaked advanced to the semifinals of the United States Championship, defeating grandmaster Boris Gulko before losing to eventual champion Nick de Firmian.1998 US Chess Championship Having entered college at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County on a full chess scholarship in 1998, he helped lead UMBC to the 1998 Pan-American Intercollegiate Championship as his team's top-rated player.Review of Harvard team's performance at the 1998 Pan-American Intercollegiate Chess Championship He eventually transferred to the University of Arizona where he graduated with a degree in computer science. 
Tal Shaked eventually gave up competitive chess, though he remained active with blitz chess on the internet. His last serious competition was the FIDE World Chess Championship 1999, and he had already decided to leave chess prior to that tournament due to motivation and the economic uncertainty in being a professional chess player.
Shaked received his masters in computer science from the University of Washington in 2004. He now works as a software engineer for Google.

Nathan Judah ben Solomon was a Provençal Jewish physician and scholar of the fourteenth century. His Provençal names were En Bongodas and Bonjues and he was probably a native of Avignon, where lived many other members of the Nathan family. Judah, like all the other members of his family, added to his father's name the formula "of the race of Ben Jesse," which is probably an allusion to the house of David, from which several Provençal families claimed to be descended. 
Nathan devoted himself chiefly to the translation of scientific works from the Arabic into Hebrew. His translations, which are still extant in manuscript, were: 
Nathan was also the author of an original work entitled Iggeret (Letter), defending the study of philosophy against the attacks of the Orthodox.Vatican MS. No. 296.

CATEGORIES: Kudurru boundary stones, Sculpture of the Ancient Near East, Collections of the Louvre

The Nazimaruttash kudurru stone is a boundary stone (kudurru) of Nazimaruttaš, a Kassite king of Babylon, ca. 1307–1282 BC (short chronology). It was found at Susa and is now displayed at the Louvre.
Some kudurrus are known for their portrayal of the king, etc., who consigned it. Most kudurrus portray Mesopotamian gods, which are often portrayed graphically in segmented registers on the stone. Nazimaruttash's kudurru does not use registers. Instead, graphic symbols are used. Nineteen deities are invoked to curse the foolhardy individual who seeks to desecrate it. Some are represented by symbols, such as a goat-fish for Enki or a bird on a pole for Papsukkal, a spear-head for Marduk or an eight-pointed star for Ishtar. Shamash is represented by a disc.[tpl] cite book | title = Studies in Biblical and Semitic Symbolism | author = Maurice H.

[[Digital X-ray radiogrammetry]]
CATEGORIES: Radiology

Digital X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR) is a method for measuring bone mineral density (BMD). Digital X-ray radiogrammetry is based on the old technique of radiogrammetry. In DXR the cortical thickness of the three middle metacarpal bones in the hand is measured in a digital X-ray image by a computer and is through a geometrical operation converted to bone mineral density. The BMD is corrected for porosity of the bone, estimated by a texture analysis performed on the cortical part of the bone.
Like other technologies for estimating the bone mineral density, the outputs are an areal BMD value, a T-score and a Z-score for assessing osteoporosis and the risk of bone fracture.
Digital X-ray radiogrammetry is primarily used in combination with digital mammography for osteoporosis screening, where same mammography machine that is used to acquire breast X-ray images is also used to acquire a hand image for BMD measurement. Due to high precision, DXR is also used for monitoring change in bone mineral density over time.

[[Conditional sale]]
CATEGORIES: Sales, Real property law, Real estate

A conditional sale is a real estate transaction where the parties have set conditions. 
A standard real estate transaction usually begins when a prospective purchaser submits an offer to purchase to the vendor of a property. As in a standard offer, a conditional offer sets out the terms of the sale such as the purchase price, the date of closing, the names of the parties, and the amount of any required deposit, but it also stipulates various conditions which must be met in order for the contract to be binding on the parties. These conditions may include approval by a co-purchaser, financing acceptable to the purchaser, the receipt and review of a survey showing that the buildings on the property comply with local zoning regulations, a title search showing no unacceptable liens or encumbrances, confirmation from the current mortgagee that the property is not in foreclosure, and the like. If the offer is accepted by the vendor, the offer to purchase will become a contract binding on the parties when all conditions are satisfied.
An alternative to a conditional sale is an invitation to treat. Unlike a conditional sale, an invitation to treat does not become binding upon satisfaction of any conditions. Issues arise as to the distinction between actions which constitute an offer or an invitation to treat, especially when the intentions of the parties are not clearly specified at the time.

CATEGORIES: Anti-Arabism, Far-right politics in France, Racism in France, Terrorist incidents in the 1970s, Terrorist incidents in the 1980s, Terrorism in France

The Charles Martel Group (also known as the Charles Martel Club) was a French far-right anti-Arab terrorist organization which operated in the 1970s and 1980s.  It was named after Charles Martel, the Frankish military leader who defeated invaders of the Umayyad Caliphate at the Battle of Tours in 732.
Their attacks were primarily centered on Algerian properties or businesses and also aimed at the Algerian government.  This stemmed from the near decade long Algerian war fought between France and Algeria after World War II between 1954-1962.  Algeria had long been a colony of the French and saw other colonized nations gaining their independence, mainly from Great Britain.  This among other factors led to a war that included acts of brutality, torture and guerrilla warfare.  The end result was an independent Algeria but a tremendous amount of hostility remaining between the two nations.  What added insult to injury for French citizens was at the end of the decade when refugees from Algeria began to migrate north and settle in the French countryside.           
Choosing Martel as the namesake of the radical group stems from his successful defense of the then Frankish Kingdom over a thousand years prior. 
There have been other groups with similar interests to that of the Charles Martel Group in and outside of France.  A terrorist organization targeting the French government for supporting the Algerian independence movement popped up using a similar name in the 1960s before the radical group came together.  This original group never got around to acts of violence.  A Charles Martel Society has formed in America[tpl]clarify|date=October 2013[/tpl] with some radical overtones, but it too seems to be a non-violent group.[tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 12th-century rabbis, Provençal Jews, People from Narbonne, Levites, French Orthodox rabbis, 12th-century French people

Moses ben Joseph ben Merwan ha-Levi (flourished about the middle of the twelfth century) was a prominent Provençal rabbi and Talmudist.
He was a nephew and pupil of Isaac ben Merwan ha-Levi. His colleagues addressed him as "Great scholar, Nasi Rabbi Moses," and his ritual decisions and Talmudic comments are often quoted. 
He directed the yeshibah at Narbonne, several of his pupils subsequently achieving fame. Abraham ben David of Posquières and Zerahiah Gerondi were among his pupils. He was in continuous correspondence with his younger colleague Abraham ben Isaac, ab bet din, who was his pupil and who by preference sought Moses' advice in difficult casuistic questions. 
Jacob ben Moses of Bagnols quotes a document relating to a divorce drawn up at Narbonne in 1134 and signed by the "great rabbi Moses ben Joseph and by Eliezer ben Zechariah." Gross identifies this Moses ben Joseph with Moses ben Joseph Merwan. If this identification is correct, Moses was one of the foremost cabalists of southern France, as Jacob's words in the passage cited indicate, although Moses is not otherwise known as a mystic.

[[Siddhashrama]]
CATEGORIES: Hindu mythology

In Hinduism, Siddhashrama ([tpl]IAST|Siddhāśrama[/tpl]) (Devanagari:सिद्धाश्रम) is a hermitage, which according to a tradition, is located in a secret land deep in the Himalayas, where great yogis, sadhus, and sages who are siddha's live. This place is also revered as the mystical land of Shambhala by Tibetans. According to another tradition, the Siddhashrama is located in the present-day Buxar district in Bihar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://buxar.bih.nic.in/History.htm|title=District History|publisher=Buxar district website|accessdate=2009-11-14[/tpl] Among the Sadhak of different cults Siddhashram is famous as ‘Siddhalok’, ‘Divyabhumi’, ‘Gyangunj’, ‘Shambala’ etc. Though any Sadhu, Sanyasi, Yeti, Monk and Yogi might have known 'Siddhashram' by any name or various cults might have used different worship or Sadhana methods according to their beliefs. 
The context of this supernatural land has been mentioned in many ancient scriptures along with four Vedas. The Siddhashram is described as a supreme place of universe. It is the accepted fact that while creating the nature, the super nature has established the earth as the representative of universe and the Siddhashram is placed above it as a controlling supreme power. Thus it is also believed that while discharging their divine works in this universe the spiritually empowered Yogis remain in constant touch with Siddhashram and they visit it regularly. Further more, it is also believed that the divine personalities like Ram, Krishna, Buddha, Shankaracharya, and Ma Anandamai etc. are present along with their bodies at Siddhashram.
Siddhashram is taken as the heartbeat of whole universe, the base of spiritual consciousness, heart of divinity and the mortification land of great Rishies. Siddhashram is equally scarce to human beings and all the visible and invisible creatures. Thus, the Siddhashram is assumed as a very scarce divine place. But it will be possible to get the divine power to enter this scarce and sacred place by doing hard works through Sadhana procedure and following Sadhana path.
Siddhashram is a secret and mystical land deep in the Himalayas, where great siddha yogis, sadhus, and sages live. Siddhashram is the ashram by our ancestors, saints, sages & Yogis of high order. It is referred to in many Indian epics,the Veda, Upanishads and Puranas including the Rigveda, the oldest scripture of human civilization.
Siddhashram is the society for the enlightened people or siddhas. The person, who reaches high level in sadhana can reach the mystical siddhashram with the blessings of the guru, who is the regular of this place. Only one or two in a thousand are fortunate enough to get the privilege of entering into Siddhashram.
The aashram was established by Param Pujya Dada Gurudev Sacchidananda Maharaj. There is no place like this in the whole universe. This aashram lies near the Mansarovar lake and the Kailash. Siddha yogis and sanyasis are meditating in this place for thousands of years. It cannot be detected from air.
Maharsih Vashishtha, Vishwamitra, Kanad, Pulastya, Atri, Mahayogi Gorakhnath, Srimad Shankaracharya, Bheesma, Kripacharya, can be seen wandering there in physical form and also one can have the privilege of listening to their sermons. Many Siddha yogi, yoginis, Apsara (Angel), saints are found to be meditating in this place. The beautiful flowers in the garden, trees, birds, siddha-yoga lake, meditating saints and many other things of the place cannot be described in words.

CATEGORIES: 1437 paintings, Paintings by Filippo Lippi, Paintings of the Madonna and Child, Collections of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica

The Madonna and Child Enthroned (also known as Madonna of Tarquinia) is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter  Fra Filippo Lippi. It is housed in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica of Palazzo Barberini, Rome. 
The work, dated "A.D. M. MCCCCXXXVII" on the cartouche, was commissioned by Giovanni Vitelleschi, Papal military commander and archbishop of Florence. The painting was probably destined to his palace in his native city of Corneto (now Tarquinia).
The centre of the composition is the face of the Madonna, who sits of a precious throne holding the Child. The attention to the volumes, inspired by Masaccio, is intermingled with the care for landscape and the light effects, which Lippi studied in the Flemish masters: the latter can be seen, for example, in details such as the pantoscopic view in the window on the left and the presence of precious objects.

The Hermes project (November 20, 1944 - December 31, 1954) was a United States Army Ordnance Corps missile program contracted to the General Electric Company. 
After German V-2 parts and technology were imported into the United States after the war,  the U. S. Army formed the Upper Atmosphere Research Panel in early 1946 to oversee experiments both about their technology and their use for upper atmosphere research. One-third of the panel members were General Electric scientists.  The Hermes project was expanded to include testing of the V-2 sounding rockets.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] General Electric employees reassembled them at White Sands Proving Grounds in New Mexico where the Army constructed a blockhouse and Launch Complex 33, now a National Historical Landmark.http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/e-resources/ebooks/records/7186.html The first V-2 launch there was on April 16, 1946 but reached only 3.4 miles altitude instead of the 35 miles achieved for later experiments.
The development of the 25 ft tall Hermes A-1 rocket was begun by General Electric in 1946. Constructed mostly of steel, it was an American version of the similarly-sized German Wasserfall anti-aircraft missile; the Wasserfall was about 1/4 the size of the German A-4 (V-2).
Beginning in 1947, components of the A-1 were successfully tested at GE's Malta Test Station in New York and at White Sands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19800214000 |title= Inventory number: A19800214000, Missile, Surface-to-Surface, Hermes A-1, Experimental |publisher= Smithsonian Institution, National Air and Space Museum[/tpl] Five A-1 rockets were successfully launched at White Sands between May 1950 and April 1951.A few Hermes launches are included in the List of V-2 test launches. The Hermes A-1 had a maximum range of 38 miles and altitude of 15 miles. 
The slightly larger Hermes A-3B was the last produced and tested vehicle of the Hermes missile program.[tpl]cite web |url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19910076000 |title= Inventory number: A19910076000, Missile, Surface-to-Surface, Hermes A-3B |publisher= Smithsonian Institution, National Air and Space Museum[/tpl] It was designed as a tactical surface-to-surface missile carrying a 1,000 lb warhead with a 150 mile range but never achieved that range in practice. It had a thrust of 22,600 lb-force. By 1953-1954 six A-3B's were test launched at White Sands, five successfully. None of the Hermes missiles became operational, but did provide experience in the design, construction, and handling of large-scale missiles and rocket engines. The Hermes program was canceled in 1954.

Johannes Pedersen (1883-1977) was a noted theologian and linguist.
Pedersen believed that "objective thought, that is to say, inactive, disinterested thought" does not exist in most instances.  Pederson was committed to the assumption that the full social context is necessary to understanding written texts.
Pedersen pointed out that in Genesis a soul is a person, not some invisible something inside a person.  Consistently, passage after passage in Genesis, this is shown to be the case.
He brilliantly understood the ideas behind the unity of the soul and body and helped many notable students write their papers. Including Peter Atkinson, who went on to become the renowned theologian of his day.

[[Herman Oliphant]]

CATEGORIES: 1884 births, 1939 deaths, Philosophers of law, American legal writers

Herman Oliphant (1884–1939) was a professor of law. He started at the University of Chicago, going to Columbia University in 1922. He was originally from Forest, Indiana, the grandson of William Oliphant, an early pioneer of that area. Herman grew up on the family farm. In 1903, he graduated from Forest High School and attended Marion College. He returned home in 1905 to marry his childhood sweetheart, Julia Sims. In 1907, he graduated from Marion College and then went on to obtain degrees from Indiana University (1909) and his law degree from the University of Chicago in 1914. Shortly after his arrival at Columbia University, he wrote to the university's president, Nicholas Murray Butler, outlining some plans he had for reorganizing the curriculum of the law school. Essentially, his goal was to transform the school into a research center, placing particular emphasis on the interaction of the law and other social sciences. Under the administration of Huger Jervey, who became dean of the law school in 1924, Oliphant's plans were used as the basis for a reorganization of the law school.
In his 1928 inaugural address as President of the American Association of Law School, Herman Oliphant said:  "Our case material is a gold mine for scientific work. It has not been scientifically exploited... We should critically examine all the methods now used in any of the social sciences and having any useful degree of objectivity."Herman Oliphant, A Return to Stare Decisis, 14 A.B.A. J. 71, 161 (1928).
In 1932 he was co-author with Theodore S. Hope Jr. of "Study of Day Calendars" 1932, an in-depth look into how time effects trial cases.
Oliphant later went on to teach at Johns Hopkins University, and later became the chief counsel of the United States Treasury Department, serving in that capacity from 1934 to 1939. While serving in that position, he was regarded as an economic experimenter, and was the prime advocate of the Undistributed profits tax.
While at the Treasury Department, he was lobbied by William Randolph Hearst to make cannabis illegal. Hearst had recently become heavily involved in synthetics based on petroleum hydrocarbons, and wanted to quash efforts from competing companies to make similar products from hemp seed oil. Although that theory has been promoted for Oliphant's push for the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, his nephew Dr. Cleon O. Swayzee of Columbia University, in a 1984 interview stated two other reasons that took precedence for Oliphant's efforts. First was the influence of Oliphant's brother Dr. Homer Oliphant a physician who practiced in Forest and Frankfort, Indiana and who was promoting the theory as early as 1919 that smoking was dangerous for the health of mothers and unborn babies. The second reason was that in the midst of the Great Depression with limited employment opportunities this endeavor was a vehicle to discourage immigration particularly from Mexico.
He is generally regarded as a representative of American legal realism and is famous for his statement that the principle of stare decisis is no longer applicable. Although the approach could be implemented in a time when society was relatively simply structured, in the present age it should be abandoned. To this effect, Oliphant pleaded a scientific approach. In his opinion, the way a judge deals with a case can be qualified as a stimulus-response situation, in the sense that the judge reacts to the stimulus of the case brought to his attention.
He died on January 11, 1939 because of heart disease at the age of 54. He is buried in Frankfort, Indiana.

[[New Zealand Railways Corporation]]
CATEGORIES: Government-owned companies of New Zealand, Railway companies of New Zealand, Railway infrastructure companies

New Zealand Railways Corporation (NZRC) is the state-owned enterprise that owns the land beneath KiwiRail's railway network on behalf of the Crown. The Corporation has existed under a number of guises since 1982, when the old New Zealand Railways Department was corporatised following deregulation of the land transport sector. In 1986, the Corporation became a State-owned enterprise, required to make a profit. Huge job losses and cut backs ensued, and the rail network, rail operations and ferry service of the Corporation were transferred to New Zealand Rail Limited in 1991. The Corporation retained ownership of the land beneath the railway network, and charged a nominal rental to New Zealand Rail, which was privatised in 1993, and renamed Tranz Rail in 1995. In 2004, following a deal with Tranz Rail's new owners Toll NZ, the Corporation took over responsibility for maintaining and upgrading the rail network once more, trading under the name ONTRACK. However negotiations with Toll over track access charges concluded after four years with no agreement reached, so the government purchased the entire rail and ferry operations, naming the service KiwiRail. KiwiRail was initially a subsidiary of the Corporation, until 31 December 2012 when the Corporation once again became the land owner.

Saint Mary Euphrasia Pelletier (Noirmoutier-en-l'Île, July 31, 1796 – Angers, April 29, 1868), born Rose Virginie Pelletier, was a French Roman Catholic nun, best known as the foundress of the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd.
She was born on an island off the coast of France where her parents had been exiled by the French Revolutionaries. She was christened Rose Virginie Pelletier and at the age of eighteen joined the Order of Our Lady of Charity who cared for girls and women in difficulty. Some of the girls were abandoned by their families or orphaned, some had turned to prostitution in order to survive. The Sisters of Our Lady of Charity provided shelter, food, vocational training and an opportunity for these girls and women to turn their lives around. Mother Mary Euphrasia formed the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd to expand this apostolate to wherever needed.
She died in Angers, France, in 1868 and was canonized by Pope Pius XII in 1940. Her feast day is 24 April.

Gerarda ("Gerda") Maria Kraan (born 30 July 1933) is a retired female middle distance runner from the Netherlands, who twice represented her native country at the Summer Olympics: 1960 (Rome) and 1964 (Tokyo).  In 1962 she won the gold medal in the women's 800 metres race at the 1962 European Championships in Belgrade.
Kraan is the oldest sibling in a family of 14 children. Initially she trained in handball, while working as a police officer, and changed to athletics only in 1954, aged 21. At her first major race in 1958 she improved the Dutch record in the 800 m to 2,16.6. She shaved another 8 seconds from it the next year, and in 1960 qualified for the Olympics, where she was eliminated in a preliminary round. After that she worked hard to improve her running technique and fitness, winning five national titles and setting nine national 800 m records between 1958 and 1963. During that period she also competed in 400 m, 440 yd and 880 yd races. In 1962 she won the 800 m European title with a new European record of 2,02.8. At the next Olympics in 1964 she was an obvious favourite, but finished in a mere seventh place.

[[Ctenochasmatoidea]]
CATEGORIES: Ctenochasmatoids

Ctenochasmatoidea is a group of pterosaurs within the suborder Pterodactyloidea. It was defined by Unwin (2003) as the clade containing Cycnorhamphus suevicus, Pterodaustro guinazui, their most recent common ancestor, and all its descendants. The earliest known ctenochasmatoid remains date to the Late Jurassic Kimmeridgian age. Previously, a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom, was considered the oldest known. This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae,Buffetaut, E. and Jeffrey, P. (2012).

The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air, broadcast on CBS Radio during the 1930s, attempted to bring the success of Florenz Ziegfeld's stage shows to the new medium of radio.
Eddie Dowling hosted the musical variety format. Sponsored by Chrysler Motors, the half-hour series aired Sunday evenings from April 3 to June 26, 1932, moving April 24 from 8:30pm ET to 10:30pm ET. 
With Al Goodman leading the orchestra, the line-up of guests included Fanny Brice, Helen Morgan, Jack Pearl, Will Rogers, and Ziegfeld himself. Pearl introduced his "Baron Munchausen" character.
Ziegfeld died on July 22, 1932, but the series returned from February 22 to June 6, 1936, serving as a tribute to the showman. Goodman returned as orchestra leader, and Brice appeared in the sketch series that eventually expanded into The Baby Snooks Show. Other guests included Patty Chapin, James Melton, and Benny Fields.

Solomon ben Reuben Bonfed (late 14th-century-early 15th century) was a Spanish rabbi and poet who lived in Zaragoza.
His diwan, still extant in manuscript (Adolf Neubauer, "Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS." No. 1984), is notable, as well as for the historical information contained in it. 
Bonfed was present at the controversy of Tortosa (1413–14); and many of his poems are addressed to those who took part in it.
The diwan contains also an answer, in rimed prose, to a letter of the converted Jew, Astruc Raimuch of Fraga, in which the neophyte enthusiastically propounds the dogmas of Christianity, and endeavors to demonstrate the Trinity, original sin, and redemption, from the Bible. Apologizing for discussing the contents of a letter not addressed to him, Bonfed minutely examines the Christian dogmas, and proceeds to argue how irrational and untenable they are. He says: "You twist and distort the Bible text to establish the Trinity. Had you a quaternity to prove, you would demonstrate it quite as strikingly and convincingly from the Old Testament."

Curcumin and curcuminoids, though having a structure resembling diferulic acids', are not formed that way but through a condensation process. Just as ferulic acid is not the proper IUPAC name, the diferulic acids also tend to have trivial names that are more commonly used than the correct IUPAC name. Diferulic acids are found in plant cell walls, particularly those of grasses.

[[Abraham Bedersi]]
CATEGORIES: Medieval French Jews, Hebrew-language poets, 13th-century French people, 13th-century Jews

Abraham Bedersi was a Provençal Jewish poet; he was born at Béziers (whence his surname Bedersi, or native of Béziers). The dates of his birth and death have not been ascertained. 
An elegy which he composed during his youth, upon the Confiscation of the Books of the Law, is supposed by some scholars to refer to the burning of the Talmud in Paris about the year 1242; by others, to the confiscation of the Talmud in Aragon in 1264, as the direct result of the Barcelona controversy. If the latter view is correct, Bedersi may well have flourished about the year 1240 (Leopold Zunz, Z.G., p. 413).
As appears from the letter sent by Bedersi to Don Vidal Solomon (Ḥotam Toknit, p. 4), he went early (perhaps in 1273) to Perpignan, where he attended the lectures of Joseph Ezubi. He returned often to Perpignan and took an active part in its communal affairs. A number of his letters, contained in MS. cviii (72) of the Vienna Hofbibliothek, are written to prominent Jews in Barcelona, asking them to aid their less fortunate coreligionists. 
At one time he lived at Arles, and in 1285, during the war of France with Roussillon, he took refuge in Narbonne. He seems at one time to have been rich, for in a poem he declares that he is independent and writes for his own pleasure. The compiler of his diwan relates that Bedersi sent money to the wandering poet Gorni (Luzzatto, Intro. to Ḥotam Toknit, p. 4).
Bedersi was a prolific writer. Several collections of his poems are still extant in manuscript in various libraries. The most complete manuscript is that in the British Museum, Add. No. 27,168. This contains an elegy on the death of his relative, David of Cabestan; several poems and letters addressed to Todros Abulafia and his companion, Abu al-Ḥasan Saul; poems dedicated to the physician of the king of Castile, Abu al-Ḥasan Meïr ibn al-Ḥarit; and the elegy mentioned above.
Two of Bedersi's works were published, with an interesting introduction by Luzzatto, by G. Polak, Amsterdam, 1862: 
Another poetical work, entitled Bakashat ha-Lamedin, published at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, 1812, was attributed to Abraham Bedersi; but it is probable that this poem was written by his son Jedaiah Bedersi.
Bedersi's works show the decadence of Jewish poetry at that time. His style is stiff and unintelligible, though he possessed a thorough knowledge of Hebrew.

Black-goggled Tanager (Trichothraupis melanops) is a species of bird in the family, Thraupidae. It is the only member of the genus  Trichothraupis. It is found at low levels in forest and woodland in a large part of eastern and southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and far north-eastern Argentina, with a disjunct population along the East Andean slope in Peru, Bolivia and far north-western Argentina. While generally common and widespread, and consequenly considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN, the population associated with the Andes is relatively local and uncommon.
The underparts are tawny, the back and head are dull brownish-olive, and the tail and wings are contrastingly black (the latter with a white speculum that is difficult to see when perched, but conspicuous in flight). The male has a yellow crown patch and a large black patch around the eyes (the black "goggles" for which the species is named).

John McGarvie (1795 – 12 April 1853)Jean F. Arnot, 'McGarvie, John (1795–1853)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 2, MUP, 1967, p. 166. retrieved 2009-09-29 was a Scottish-born Australian Presbyterian minister and writer. 
McGarvie was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and was educated at Glasgow University, where he graduated.
In 1825 the Rev. John Dunmore Lang appealled for a minister for the church at Portland Head on the Hawkesbury River, New South Wales; McGarvie was chosen and arrived in Sydney in the Greenock on 22 May 1826 after a six-month voyage from Leith. Met on arrival by Reverend Lang, McGarvie went straight to Portland Head as the first Presbyterian minister of the Ebenezer Church, remaining until 1830.
In 1829 McGarvie contributed a series of biographical articles to the Sydney Gazette with a number of his poems under such pseudonyms as 'M., Ananbaba', 'A.B., Marramatta' and 'C.D., Warrambamba'. When the Sydney Herald commenced in 1831, with his brother William as one of its three original proprietors, he contributed the editorials, and continued as leader writer for a significant period. McGarvie was one of the founders in 1826 of the Sydney Dispensary (afterwards the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary, and later Sydney Hospital) and was its honorary secretary from 1836 until his death. He was also a founder of the Sydney School of Arts. On the establishment of the Australian College in 1831 he conducted the mathematics department and also lectured in chemistry and natural philosophy.
In 1832 McGarvie accepted an invitation to start a second Presbyterian congregation in Sydney and held services in the courthouse until St Andrew's Scots Church was built at Kent Street near Bathurst Street. The church opened for divine service on 13 September 1835 and he remained as its minister until his death in 1853. Among the children he christened was John McGarvie Smith.
In 1840 the University of Glasgow awarded McGarvie an honorary Doctor of Divinity for his lifetime achievement. A volume of his sermons was published in Sydney in 1842.  He died on 12 April 1853 and was buried at Gore Hill cemetery, he was unmarried.

An outstanding opera singer, she represented the Russian vocal school at its best.
Nezhdanova was born in Kryva Balka, near Odessa, Ukraine, then in the Russian Empire. In 1899, she entered the Moscow Conservatory. Upon her graduation three years later she joined the Bolshoi Theatre, rapidly becoming its leading soprano. She sang often, too, at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg and also in Kiev and Odessa. Paris heard her in 1912, when she appeared opposite the great tenor Enrico Caruso and Caruso's baritone equivalent, Titta Ruffo.
Nezhdanova was the dedicatee of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Vocalise, and she was the first performer of the arrangement for soprano and orchestra, with the composer conducting.  She created a number of operatic roles. After the 1917 Russian Revolution she stayed on at the Bolshoi, unlike some of her fellow opera singers, who left their native country for the West. In 1936, she began to teach singing in Moscow and was appointed a professor at the city's conservatory in 1943.
She was married to the conductor Nikolai Golovanov and died in Moscow in 1950.
Nezhdanova made a number of recordings that display the beauty and flexibility of her voice and the excellence of her technique. She is considered by opera historians and critics to have been one of the finest sopranos of the 20th century.

Jacob ben David ben Yom Tov (also Yomtob or Jomtob or Bonjourn or Bonet or Po'el or Fu'al)Description of Manuscript ljs057, Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text and Image, University of Pennsylvania was a Catalan Jewish astronomer and astrologer. He lived, probably at Perpignan, in southern France in the fourteenth century.
He was the author of astronomical tables prepared at Perpignan in 1361. These tables, still extant in manuscript (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, MS. No. 10,901; Adolf Neubauer, "Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS." No. 2072, 2), enjoyed a great reputation. They were translated into Latin in the fifteenth century, and were the subject of many Hebrew commentaries, among which was one written by Joseph ben Saul Ḳimḥi (Vatican MSS. Nos. i., v., 1, 7). Many manuscripts of these tables were retranslated from Latin into Hebrew.
His father David ben Yom-Tov, also called David Bongoron, was identified in the past with the Portuguese Jewish philosopher David ben Yom-Tov ibn Bilia by some scholars, including the nineteenth century scholar Moritz Steinschneider.  However the two are now believed to have been separate individuals.

[[ICon festival]]
CATEGORIES: Festivals in Israel, History of Tel Aviv, Science fiction conventions in Asia

ICon is an Israeli Science Fiction and Fantasy fan convention held annually in the Tel Aviv Eshkol Pais during the Sukkot holiday in September-October. Venues in previous years included the adjacent Cinematheque, Eeroni Aleph school and ZOA house. The first ICon was held in autumn 1998.
ICon is normally 3 days long, though in previous years it featured a parallel film festival which lasted longer.
The title is a contraction of "Israeli Convention". Graphically, "IC" resembles the first letter of the title in Hebrew, hence the capitalization.
ICon features a plethora of talks on subjects including literature, science, television, films, specific fandoms and general genre theory as well as writing and art workshops and a host of roleplaying games. It normally features an original film, play or musical created by Israeli science fiction fans. ICon 2013 featured over 270 such events over the 3.5 days period.
Rather than a dealers room, ICon features a dealers court through the festival lobby and the outdoors areas of the venue. 
The festival usually features a battle ring where costumed LARP players and visitors can battle against each other with special soft weapons.
The annual Geffen Award ceremony for Hebrew and translated science fiction and fantasy literature is held in ICon since 1999.
The venue consists of the Eshkol Pais building, which features talks, a makeshift "café" rest area, a tabletop games room and some of the dealers' court including a second-hand booth where visitors deposit used goods for sale.
The Eeroni Aleph adjacent school is used for roleplaying games and allows out-of-town visitors to sleep inside for the duration of the night.
Nearby venues, such as ZOA, are sometimes used as well on busier years.
Past guests and guests of honor include authors Orson Scott Card Guy Gavriel Kay, Steven Brust, Neil Gaiman and Daryl Gregory, as well as actors Chase Masterson and others.
Each ICon is centered around a main theme. Themes in past years include identity, discovery, rejuvenation, "beyond the mirror" and cities.
The festival is completely volunteer based. Its organizers are all Non-profit Organizations. 2013 saw over 250 volunteers (including staff) running ICon.
Over the years ICon was held by Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy and Israeli Roleplaying Association, along with "Starbase 972" Star Trek fan club and others.
Since 2010, due to dispute among festival organizers, the festival was split to two festivals: "ICon", organized by Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy and held in the Eshkol Pais in Tel Aviv, and "Utopia" (previously "Icon TLV") at the Cinematheque in Tel Aviv.

[[Negarchy]]
CATEGORIES: Political philosophy, Political science terms, International relations theory

Negarchy was a term coined by Daniel Deudneyhttp://www.ciaonet.org/wps/kuc01/ to mean a form of status quo maintained by the inter-relations of the power structure and authority that modern states hold in relation to each other which negate each other due to their respective influence. The situation of this kind of power compromise results in putting limits upon and reining in the rule of all such states by reducing their individual power and potential influence. Thus it is a rule of their own creation that they are also unwillingly subject to. Comparisons have been drawn between 'negarchy' and natural law structureshttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3671/is_199504/ai_n8727895/pg_9[tpl]Dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] as well as with intranational markets.http://www.engagingcommunities2005.org/abstracts/Ralph-Natalie-final.pdf Negarchy is described as being a form of governing between "anarchy and hierarchy".http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol6/No4/art1-04.html

Zichyújfalu (IPA: [tpl]IPA|ˈziʧiuːjfɒlu[/tpl]) is a village in Fejér county, Hungary, about 10 km from Lake Velencei, which is more or less easy to reach on road and on railway (Pusztaszabolcs-Székesfehérvár line). The settlement used to be a part of Gárdony but declared its independence in December 1997.
The settlement is first mentioned in writing in 1239, when villa Nowa (Nova) belonged to the Vértes estates of the Csák clan. In 1447 it is mentioned as a noble name as Wyfalw (Újfalu).
The Family Zichy appeared as the landlord in Újfalu during Turkish occupation. After the Turkish rule the serfs of Seregélyes rented the land for some time. In 1784 the owner of the estate, János Zichy, the son of Ferenc Zichy had a castle built in Újfalu and established a deer-park.
The paphrase Zichy in the name of the settlement refers to these earlier landlords, the members of the Zichy family. The hunting residence of de count is also in the village; currently the Mayor's Office functions in this building, therefore the building can only be observed from outside. The park and the forest of the castle offer active relaxation.

[tpl]nihongo|Chūson-ji|中尊寺[/tpl] is a Buddhist temple in Hiraizumi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan. It is the head temple of the Tendai sect in Tōhoku (northeastern Japan). The Tendai sect claims that the temple was founded in 850 by Ennin, the third chief abbot of the sect, but most scholars believe that Chūson-ji was founded by Fujiwara no Kiyohira in about 1100. There is no archaeological or historical record of Buddhist activity in this area before 1100.
The Konjiki-dō (金色堂) or 'Golden Hall' is a mausoleum containing the mummified remains of the leaders of the Northern Fujiwara (奥州藤原氏 Ōshū Fujiwara-shi) clan who ruled much of northern Japan in the 12th century. It is one of two buildings that survive from the original Chūson-ji temple complex, the other being a sutra repository. The building is made of wood entirely covered with gold leaf decorated with imported mother-of-pearl. It was carefully rebuilt from 1962 to 1968 by a team of specialists. The building measures five-and-a-half meters on each side and is eight meters tall. The interior of the building contains three altars, one for each of the first three Fujiwara lords. Originally there were 33 sculptures inside the temple, eleven on each altar, but now one is missing. Each altar had a seated Amida surrounded by standing Kannon and Seishi, six Jizō and two Niten statues. One Niten figure is missing.
The mummies were last examined in 1950. It is assumed that the mummy of Fujiwara no Kiyohira was placed under the central altar. Fujiwara no Motohira's remains were identified as he is known to have died of a cerebral hemorrhage. His mummy was found under the northwest altar. Fujiwara no Hidehira's remains were found under the southwest altar next to a casket containing the head of his son Fujiwara no Yasuhira who was beheaded in 1189.
The Konjiki-dō formerly sat outdoors in the open air. Later a wooden building was built around it to protect it from the elements. Now it sits in a concrete building behind thick acrylic glass and is only visible from the front. Shōgyo Ōba, a Maki-e lacquer artist, helped to restore the interior lacquer work in 1964.[tpl]cite news|first=Yoshihiro|last=Shinano|title=Oba Shogyo, Maki-e, holder of important intangible cultural property (1982) |url=http://shofu.pref.ishikawa.jp/shofu/intro_e/HTML/H_S30702.html |work=Ishikawa Prefecture |publisher=|date= |accessdate=2012-07-04[/tpl]

Vlahov  declared himself until the early 1930s as a Bulgarian and afterwards as an Ethnic Macedonian.Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, ISBN 0810862956, p. 235.During the 20th century, Slav Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift. Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Ethnologia Balkanica Series, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, ISBN 3825813878, p. 127. However such left Macedonian activists never managed to get rid of their strong Bulgarophile sentiments.Palmer, S. and R. King Yugoslav Communism and the Macedonian Question, Archon Books (June 1971), p. 137.According to the Macedonian historian Academician Ivan Katardzhiev all left-wing Macedonian revolutionaries from the period until the early 1930s declared themselves as "Bulgarians" and he asserts that the political separatism of some Macedonian revolutionaties toward official Bulgarian policy was yet only political phenomenon without ethnic character. This will bring even Dimitar Vlahov on the session of the Politburo of the Macedonian communist party in 1948, when speaking of the existence of the Macedonian nation, to say that in 1932 (when left wing of IMRO issued for the first time the idea of separate Macedonian nation) a mistake was made. Katardzhiev claims all this veterans from IMRO (United) and Bulgarian communist party remained only at the level of political, not of national separatism. Thus, they practically continued to feel themselves as Bulgarians, i.e. they didn't developed clear national separatist position even in Communist Yugoslavia. Академик Катарџиев, Иван. Верувам во националниот имунитет на македонецот, интервjу за списание „Форум“, 22 jули 2000, броj 329.
He was born in Kilkis (present-day Greece) and attended the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. After that he emigrated to the Kingdom of Bulgaria and graduated from secondary school in Belogradtchik. Vlachov also studied chemistry in Germany and Switzerland, where he took part in socialist circles.  However, he graduated in these subjects from Sofia University. Here he enrolled in the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party. In 1903, Vlahov entered a military service in an officer's school in Sofia. Then he worked as a teacher in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki where he was active in IMRO. During this period, he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities. In 1905, Vlahov was released and went back to Bulgaria where he worked as a teacher in Kazanlak. In 1908, after the Young Turks revolution he began working in the Bulgarian secondary school in Thessaloniki again.
In the next few years, Vlahov was politically active as a member of the Ottoman Parliament as a representative from the People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section). After the dissolution of the PFP in 1911, he became a member the Ottoman Socialist Party and in 1912 was elected again as a deputy in the Ottoman Parliament. After the Balkan Wars, Vlachov was a representative of the Kingdom of Bulgaria in high diplomatic and administrative positions in Odessa, Kiev, Pristina and Vienna. After World War I and the reestablishment of IMRO in 1920, Vlahov was elected as alternate member of its Central Committee, representing the left wing. At that time he was a Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Varna. Todor Alexandrov urged him to establish a contact between IMRO and Soviet Russia. As a messenger served Krastyo Rakovski, his best man and prominent figure of the Comintern. On behalf of IMRO, Vlahov departed in July 1923 to Moscow. So in 1924, IMRO entered negotiations in Vienna with the Comintern about collaboration between the communists and the Macedonian movement and the creation of a united Macedonian movement. Vlahov helped the subscription of the so-called May Manifesto about forming a Balkan Communist Federation and cooperation with the Soviet Union. After the subsequent rift between the organization and the Communists, the new leadership headed by Ivan Mihailov excluded him from the organization and he was sentenced to death. In 1925, he was one of the founders of the IMRO (United) in Vienna. He also became a member of Bulgarian Communist Party. During the late 1920s, he worked in France, Germany and Austria as a Comintern publicist. During this period he was chased by IMRO and against him were organized several failed assassination attempts.
In 1932 a members of IMRO (United), put for the first time the issue of the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation in a lecture in Moscow.Произходът на македонската нация - Стенограма от заседание на Македонския Научен Институт в София през 1947 г. The question was also studied in the highest institutions of the Comintern and in the autumn of 1933, Dimitar Vlahov arrived in Moscow and took part in a number of meetings.Мемоари на Димитър Влахов. Скопје, 1970, стр. 356. So on January 11, 1934, the Political Secretariat of the Comintern adopted a special Resolution on the Macedonian Question. From 1936 to 1944, Vlahov lived in the Soviet Union and in 1944 he went to the new Yugoslavia with Socialist Republic of Macedonia, where he worked in high state and political positions.
In 1948 on a meeting of the Central committee of the Macedonian Communist Party he claimed that the decision by the IMRO (United) from 1932 on the formation of a separate Macedonian ethnicity was a political mistake.Академик Катарџиев, Иван. Верувам во националниот имунитет на македонецот, интервjу за списание „Форум“, 22 jули 2000, броj 329. Later, he was gradually pushed out of his power positions from the pro-Yugoslav circle around Lazar Kolishevski. Vlahov died in Belgrade in 1953.

[[Ball spline]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanical engineering stubs, Bearings

Ball splines (Ball Spline bearings) are a special type of linear motion bearing that are used to provide nearly frictionless linear motion while allowing the member to transmit torque simultaneously. There are grooves ground along the length of the shaft (thus forming splines) for the recirculating ground balls to run inside. The outer shell that houses the balls is called a nut rather than a bushing, but is not a nut in the traditional sense—it is not free to rotate about the shaft, but is free to travel up and down the shaft. 
By increasing the contact area of the ball bearings on the shaft to approximately 45 degrees, the side load and direct load carrying capabilities are greatly increased. Each nut can be individually preloaded at the factory to decrease the available radial play to ensure rigidity. This process not only increases the contact area, increasing direct loading capabilities, but it also restricts any radial movement, increasing the overhung moment capabilities.  This creates a sturdier structure that can handle a very strenuous working environment.

USS ''LST-853 was an [tpl]sclass|LST-542|tank landing ship[/tpl] in the United States Navy during World War II. Later in her U.S. Navy career she was renamed Kane County'' (LST-853)—after counties in Illinois and Utah—but never saw active service under that name.
LST-853 was laid down on 30 August 1944 at Seneca, Illinois, by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Co.; launched on 17 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Ellen Scott De-Coursey; and commissioned on 11 December 1944, Lt. Charles B. Salsbury in command.
After shakedown off Florida, LST-853 departed New Orleans for the Pacific 19 January 1945. She loaded troops and equipment on the west coast before steaming from Seattle 10 March. Sailing via Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Guam, she arrived at Saipan 25 April. The landing ship embarked units of the 1878th Engineer Aviation Battalion, then sailed on the 27th for Okinawa. Arriving 6 days later in the midst of enemy air raids, LST-853 discharged men and equipment on this strategic base which lay at the gateway to Japan.
She returned to Saipan 24 May and, during the remaining months of the war, shuttled troops and equipment among the Marianas, Philippines and Okinawa staging areas for the planned invasion of Japan. The enemy's acceptance of Allied peace terms obviated an invasion, so LST-853 then operated in the Far East, transporting occupation forces until early December.
Arriving Saipan 13 December 1945, she embarked veterans of the Pacific fighting in the Marianas and sailed for the United States in January 1946. After arrival on the West Coast, LST-853 then sailed to Astoria, Oregon; and decommissioned at Vancouver, Washington, 24 July 1946.

Northern Virginia is part of the Washington Metropolitan Area of the United States, and its surface transit system is integrated with that of the city of Washington, D.C. However, because of the Potomac River separating Northern Virginia from the city, the two systems have evolved largely independently. At present, most major bus routes, including all that cross the Potomac, are operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), while several smaller systems are city- or county-owned.Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, [tpl]PDFlink|Metro System Route Map - Virginia and Washington, DC|4.83 MiB[/tpl], October 2005 Since the Washington Metro opened to Virginia, most of the bus routes have terminated on either side of the Potomac River, where passengers can transfer to the rapid transit system, or to one of the few Metro bus lines that crosses the river (13F, 13G).[tpl]PDFlink|Metro Timetable - Reagan National Airport-Pentagon-Washington Line[/tpl], Reprinted 9/24/12

The Florida Heartland is a region of Florida located to the north and west of Lake Okeechobee, composed of six inland, non-metropolitan counties — DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, and Okeechobee.  In 2000, The US Census Bureau recorded the population of the region at 229,509.  A 2005 US Census Bureau estimate places the region's population at 249,837, a five year growth rate of 9.0%. The most populous county in the region is Highlands County, and the region's largest city is Sebring. Unlike the coastal areas to the east and west, the rural nature of the Florida Heartland is culturally closer to the Deep South than the rest of peninsular Florida and has traditionally been inhabited by Americans of predominately English ancestry.Cecile Hulse Matschat, Suwannee River: Strange Green Land (University of Georgia Press, 1938), page 1-14  While located in Palm Beach County, the nearby rural cities of Belle Glade and Pahokee, located on the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, are more associated with the Florida Heartland than South Florida.

USS ''LST-900 was an [tpl]sclass|LST-542|tank landing ship[/tpl] in the United States Navy during World War II. Late in her career, she was renamed Linn County'' (LST-900)—after counties in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Oregon—but saw no active service under that name.
LST-900 was laid down on 1 October 1944 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the Dravo Corp.; launched on 9 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Felix R. Konkle; and commissioned on 6 January 1945, Lieutenant Neil A. McClaflin in command.
After completing shakedown off Florida she loaded cargo at New Orleans and sailed for the west coast on 9 February. Arriving at San Francisco on 6 March, she departed 2 days later for Pearl Harbor where she arrived the 17th and began amphibious landing exercises. She cleared Hawaii 24 May; steamed in convoy via Eniwetok, Guam, and Saipan; and reached Okinawa, Ryukyus, 26 June. During the next 2 weeks she discharged cargo and ammunition at Okinawa and Kerama Retto, and, after embarking medical officers and corpsmen, sailed for the Marianas 10 July. She arrived Guam the 16th, thence steamed to Saipan to transport Seabees to the Ryukyus. She debarked her passengers at Ie Shima on 7 August and departed for Saipan 2 days before the end of hostilities.
Between 3 and 9 September LST-900 steamed from Saipan to Leyte Gulf, Philippines. On the 19th she reached Batangas, Luzon and after embarking Army engineers departed in convoy for Japan 29 September. She reached Tokyo Bay 17 October and discharged occupation troops at Yokohama the next day. On the 28th she departed for the Marianas where she embarked troops at Guam for transfer to the United States. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she reached Seattle, Washington, 15 December.
LST-900 operated along the west coast during the next few months and decommissioned 15 May 1946. While berthed in the Columbia River with ships of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, she was named Linn County on 1 July 1955. 
Linn County was leased to the Republic of Korea on 2 December 1958, stricken from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 8 February 1959, and sold to Korea on 15 November 1974.
LST-900 earned one battle star for World War II service.

[[Portrait of the Vendramin Family]]

CATEGORIES: 1543 paintings, Collections of the National Gallery, London, Titian portraits

The Portrait of the Vendramin Family is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Titian, executed around 1543-1547. It presently hangs in the National Gallery in London.
The canvas was commissioned by the noble Vendramin family, and portrays, as dictated by Venetian custom, only male members of the dynasty.[ref]
</ref> It includes the brothers Andrea and Gabriele Vendramin, and Andrea's seven sons. However Andrea was apparently only three years older than Gabriele, which one would not think from the two figures here. It remains uncertain which  depicted by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Gentile Bellini]] and other artists in a series of paintings for the [[Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista]]. When accidentally dropped into a canal during a congested procession the relic did not sink but hovered over the water, evading others trying to help, until an earlier Andrea Vendramin dived in and retrieved it.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/750096 JSTOR] ''The Miraculous Cross in Titian's "Vendramin Family"'', Philip Pouncey, Journal of the Warburg Institute, Vol. 2, No. 3 (Jan., 1939), pp. 191-193</ref>  This Andrea had been presented with the relic in 1369, in his capacity as head of the [[confraternity]] or [[Scuole Grandi of Venice|Scuola]] of San Giovanni Evangelista.<ref>Gould, ''The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools'', p.&nbsp;285</ref> Both the large Bellini painting, ''The Miracle of the True Cross near San Lorenzo Bridge'', of 1496-1500, and the Carpaccio of 1494, are now in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Accademia]] museum in Venice.
Titian's painting has been described as, "one of the greatest group portraits in history". It balances youth and wisdom as well as demonstrating the power of this family and their public commitments to the Republic. The relic is a central part of the portrait and was seen as both a symbol of the Serene Republic, and a personal symbol for the Vendramin family. 
The painting remained in Venice until at least 1636 when it was bought by Anthony van Dyck who was painter at the court of Charles I.  After his death it was bought by the Earl of Northumberland and passed by descent through the Earls and Dukes of Northumberland and Somerset until 1929, when it was bought by the National Gallery.Gould, The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools, p. 286  At some point it has been cut down on both sides and at the bottom.Gould, The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools, p. 284

True Grit is a 1968 novel by Charles Portis that was first published as a 1968 serial in The Saturday Evening Post.Ed Park. "Like Cormac McCarthy, But Funny", The Believer, March 2003.  The novel is told from the perspective of a woman named Mattie Ross who recounts the time when she was 14 years old and sought retribution for the murder of her father by a scoundrel named Tom Chaney.  It is considered by some criticsLehmann, Chris, "Pelecanos on the Enduring Power of 'True Grit'", NPR, June 2006Jones, Malcolm, "True Lit", Newsweek, December 9, 2010 to be "one of the great American novels".
In 1969, it was adapted for the screen as a Western film True Grit starring John Wayne as U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (a role that won John Wayne Best Actor at the Academy Awards) and Kim Darby as Mattie Ross. Wayne would reprise the role in Rooster Cogburn (1975) with an original screenplay.

CATEGORIES: 1947 books, Harry Partch, Music books, Just tuning and intervals

Genesis of a Music is a book first published in 1947 by microtonal composer Harry Partch (1901–1974).
Partch first presents a polemic against both equal temperament and the long history of stagnation in the teaching of music; according to Alex Ross, this is "the most startling forty-five-page history of music ever written". In particular, Partch holds Johann Sebastian Bach responsible for a downhill trend in music, holding him responsible for "the movement toward equal-tempered tuning, which meant that composers could not absorb the scales of other world traditions; and the urge to make music ever more instrumental and abstract."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/18/050418crmu_music|title=Off the Rails|last=Ross|first=Alex|date=18 April 2005|work=The New Yorker|page=199|accessdate=4 January 2013[/tpl]

[[Margery Fisher]]
CATEGORIES: 1913 births, 1992 deaths, English literary critics, Children's literature criticism

Margery Lilian Edith Fisher (née Turner) 1913–1992 was a British literary critic and academic.
She was internationally renowned for her influence in promoting the importance of good literature for children. This came about through her books, world lecture tours and her own notable journal Growing Point. Her papers for the period 1937–1992 are held in the Department of Special Collections at the University of California.http://www.library.ucla.edn/libraries/special/scweb
She was born in Camberwell, London in 1913 but spent her schooldays in New Zealand before returning to England to take up a place at Somerville College, Oxford where she graduated with First Class honours in English.Who's Who 1982. A & C Black After graduation she taught English at a girls' school before moving to Oundle, an English public school for boys (1939–1945). She once confided that:
 teaching straightforward boys, gently leading a football-thickie towards The Mayor of Casterbridge was far more enjoyable than dealing with devious girls as a new graduate before the warStephanie Nettell: "30 Years of Growing Point" for Keeps''; No. 73, March 1992  
By the 1950s, married to the British naturalist James Fisher and raising six children of their own, she was able to indulge her voracious passion for children's literature as a freelance book reviewer for magazines. This led to the publication in 1961 of her authoritative  guide, Intent Upon Reading. In 1962 the first issue of her own journal, Growing Point, appeared, described as "Margery Fisher's regular review of books for the growing families of the English reading world and for readers, teachers, librarians and other guardians". Front cover: Growing Point; May 1962, Volume 1, Issue 1 Its publication nine times a year continued uninterrupted for the next 30 years. It ceased publication in 1992, only months before her death.

[[Martin Russell]]

CATEGORIES: American record producers, American audio engineers, Living people

Martin Russell is a twice Grammy Award-nominated recording engineer, producer, composer, and musician. He has been a core member of the music group Afro Celt Sound System since the recording of the first album Volume 1: Sound Magic in mid-1995. As of 2010 the recorded output of the group has so far been exclusively released by Peter Gabriel's Real World Records. (The next two albums, Volume 2: Release and Volume 3: Further in Time earned the afore-mentioned Grammy Nominations). The group recorded and released three more albums Seed, Pod (an album of remixes and re-workings), and Volume 5: Anatomic. Martin has written film music for several feature films, including Hotel Rwanda and the Lebanese film Bosta.
Martin commenced his musical career in 1979, joining UK band The Enid on bass guitar and keyboards a few months after completing a BA Hons degree in music. His most notable contribution to the band's catalogue was "Once She Was", an arrangement of the folk song melody "Scarborough Fair". He remained a member until 1981, citing his increasing dissatisfaction with the whimsical vocally-based direction that the band was taking as his reason for leaving. With fellow ex-Enid keyboard player William Gilmour he formed the instrumental rock band Craft, who recorded an album which was released in 1984. He subsequently focused on studio building and sound engineering for the rest of the 1980s, notably at Utopia and Swanyard Studios before designing and building his own studio in North London, England in 1991.
Sonic Innovation opened in 1992 and has been the headquarters for the majority of Martin's music production, recording, cd mastering and film music composition activities ever since.

The Corporate Challenge was founded in 1977 by the New York Road Runners with a single race in New York City, with 200 runners from 50 companies. The top-finishing teams in all 12 cities will qualify to compete in the fifteenth, the Championship Race, held in October in New York City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/sports/html/chasecc.html |title=JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge |accessdate=2007-06-01 |publisher=New York Sports Commission |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070414034510/http://www.nyc.gov/html/sports/html/chasecc.html  |archivedate = 2007-04-14[/tpl]
Not all participants race competitively; large percentages walk or jog the entire course, with the purpose being camaraderie within and among the corporate teams.  The festival atmosphere during and after the race attracts non-runners as well.
A new and primary focus for this year’s event is the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge’s Teaming Up For A Greener Tomorrow initiative.  JPMorgan Chase aims to implement the greenest road race in each city that the Corporate Challenge is held.  To date, the Series has saved more than six tons of paper (through online registration and paper-free marketing practices), recycled on-site more than 10 tons of plastic and glass, and saved more than 5,000 gallons of crude oil (through alternate modes of transportation by participants).  That’s more than 900 million BTUs, or enough energy to light a home for nearly 10 years. 
The 25th annual JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge Championship was held on October 6, 2007, with Enos Matalane of Transnet Rail Engineering (Johannesburg) and Claire Martin of Royal Mail Letters (London) earning the men's and women's individual titles.  Transnet, Polizei Hessen (Frankfurt) and Royal Mail Letters earned the men's, women's and mixed team titles, respectively.
With nearly 74,000 participants in 2008, the Frankfurt event was the world's largest footrace that year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

The first two rock types are impermeable meaning there is little drainage for the river but the river depth becomes smaller as the water flows over the permeable limestone which will allow water to pass through. Quartzite is also very resistant to chemical weathering and can form ridges.

Historically a part of Staffordshire, and forming part of the metropolitan county of the West Midlands from 1974, the city is commonly recognised as being named after Lady Wulfrun, who founded the town in 985: its name coming from Anglo-Saxon Wulfrūnehēantūn = "Wulfrūn's high or principal enclosure or farm".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/history/farley/oldwlv.htm |title=Wolverhampton 985 – 1985 |year=1985 |author=Keith Farley |publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage Society |accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Place-names of Staffordshire |first=David |last=Horovitz |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |year=2005 |isbn=0955030900 |page=662 |page=585 |accessdate=12 November 2012 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=A History of Wolverhampton |first=Chris |last=Upton |authorlink= |publisher=The History Press |location= |year=2007 |isbn=186077508X |page=179 |page=8 |accessdate=12 November 2012 |url=[/tpl] Prior to the Norman Conquest, the area's name appears only as variants of Heantune or Hamtun, the prefix Wulfrun or similar appearing in 1070 and thereafter.

The city grew initially as a market town with specialism within the woollen trade. During and after the Industrial Revolution, the city became a major industrial centre, with mining (mostly coal, limestone and iron ore) as well as production of steel, japanning, locks, motorcycles and cars – including the first vehicle to hold the Land speed record at over 200 mph. Today, the major industries within the city are both engineering based (including a large aerospace industry) and within the service sector.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/culture/historic_weurope2.html#Anchor-United-60133 |title=Historic Cities in Western Europe |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl]

[[Jack Lake (Peterborough County)]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Peterborough County

Jack Lake is a small headwater/ feedwater lake in Ontario, Canada, within the northern portion of the Kawartha lakes region which is located at the southern end of the Canadian Shield. The clean freshwater lake which has a reasonably complex limnology is located in northern Peterborough County, approximately 100 mi (160 km) directly northeast of Toronto. There is a resort on the north-western shore of the lake, and the nearest town is Apsley, Ontario.
The lake can be generally characterised as having a fairly irregular shape, dominated by 3 deeply indented main bays and having numerous smaller or tertiary bays.  The largest bay is Sharpe Bay on the western end of the lake. The lake has served as a field research centre, water quality monitoring site and testing or analysis base for Environment Canada's National Water Research Institute (NWRI) through into the 1990s. Specific and longitudinal research work has been supported by a variety of world class academic centres and Universities over the past few decades.  Work done during this period has helped to improve understanding of how freshwater environments are impacted upon by development, recreation and wider changes within the natural environment.  
Jack Lake has a long tradition of welcoming anglers from around the world.  It was originally home to bass and trout.  As the lake developed as a tourist attraction in its own right, and as a feeder lake within the wider catchment that supports the Trent-Severn Waterway, fish species such as muskellunge, walleye, rock bass, and perch were also introduced from approximately the 1920s. More recently, Black Crappie have been introduced and are a primary target for summer and winter fisherman.  Ongoing provincial and federally supported environmental stewardship and related work experience initiatives occur on the lake from year to year.

Tennessee Johnson is a 1942 American film about Andrew Johnson, the 17th president of the United States, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  It was directed by William Dieterle and written by Milton Gunzburg, Alvin Meyers, John Balderston, and Wells Root.  It starred Van Heflin as Johnson, Lionel Barrymore as his nemesis Thaddeus Stevens, and Ruth Hussey as Eliza McCardle Johnson.  The film depicts the events building up to the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, and "presents its title character as Lincoln’s worthy successor who runs afoul of vindictive Radical Republicans."Kauffman, Bill (2011-12-02) Redford Goes Ron Paul, The American Conservative  It is somewhat historically inaccurate: among other errors, the film's climax depicts Johnson passionately delivering an oration in his own defense on the U.S. Senate floor near the end of his impeachment trial.  In fact, Johnson never appeared in person at his trial and was represented by legal counsel only.

"Avalanche" is a song by Leonard Cohen. It appears on his third album, Songs of Love and Hate, released in 1971.
The lyrics are based on a poem he had previously written. He acknowledged in a 1992 interview with Paul Zollo that his "chop", his unique pattern of playing classical guitar, is behind many of his early songs, and this one features Cohen's trademark fast, syncopated classical guitar pattern as the accompaniment on the recording of the song.[ref]

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds recorded a version of the song for their 1984 album From Her to Eternity.

CFEL-FM (or CKOI 102,1 Québec) is a French-language Canadian radio station located in Quebec City, Quebec, but the station's official city of license is Lévis.
Owned and operated by Leclerc Communication Inc., it broadcasts on 102.1 MHz using a directional antenna with an average effective radiated power of 26,500 watts and a peak effective radiated power of 78,000 watts (class C1).
The station has a contemporary hit radio format branded as 102,1 CKOI.
The station identifies itself as CKOI 102,1 Québec since November 6, 2009, though its legal calls of CFEL-FM remain the same.  Its logo was similar to sister stations CKOI Montreal and CKOI Estrie; however, as of February 2011, CFEL-FM still uses this logo, though the other stations on the CKOI network have changed its logos and imaging.
Originally based in and licensed to Montmagny, CFEL-FM received its first licence in December 1986 and replaced CKBM 1490, an unrelated station which closed due to a bankruptcy in 1983.CRTC proceedings from March 21, 2006 (in French), paragraph 3977 http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/transcripts/2006/tb0321.htm.
On July 8, 2008, 591991 B.C. Ltd., a numbered company owned by Corus Entertainment, applied to move CFEL's transmitter from L'Ange-Gardien to a new site in Quebec City.

Pepsi Max (known as Diet Pepsi Max until early 2009), is a zero-calorie, sugar-free, carbohydrate-free, ginseng-infused cola sweetened with aspartame, marketed by PepsiCo. It has nearly twice the caffeine of Pepsi's other cola beverages.Lippert, Barbara. "Diet Pepsi Max: You Snooze, You Lose", Adweek, June 26, 2007. Accessed July 9, 2007. "A cross between a cola and an energy drink, it contains twice the caffeine of regular Diet Pepsi and a touch of ginseng for the je ne sais quoi." Pepsi used airtime during Super Bowl XLII to advertise the beverage; the commercial featured the song "What is Love" by Haddaway, and showed people sleeping in inappropriate places and at inappropriate times, while bobbing their heads to the rhythm of the song. Pepsi Max's current slogan in the US is "Maximum taste. Zero calories.". In July 2010 Pepsi Max had a commercial remake from the 1995 diner commercial. The commercial includes the song "Why Can't We Be Friends?" by War. In 2011, Snoop Dogg was featured in an ad campaign around the time of the Super Bowl XLV.

Hongshanornis is a genus of ornithuromorph birds known from early Cretaceous lake deposits of the Yixian Formation, Inner Mongolia, China. The holotype specimen, recovered in 2005, is currently held by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing. It was found in the Jianshangou fossil beds, dated to 124.6 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1002/gj.1045 | last1 = Zhou | first1 = Z. | year = 2006 | title = Evolutionary radiation of the Jehol Biota: chronological and ecological perspectives | url = | journal = Geological Journal | volume = 41 | issue = 3–4| pages = 377–393 [/tpl] Three additional specimens have been reported, though only one of those has been definitively identified as belonging to Hongshanornis.[tpl]cite_doi|10.7717/peerj.234[/tpl] This latter specimen was found in the Dawangzhangzi fossil beds, which are about 122 million years old.
Hongshanornis is a member of the group Hongshanornithidae, to which it lent its name. It is closely related to Longicrusavis, which existed alongside Hongshanornis in the Dawangzhangzi ecosystem, and is very similar to the later Parahongshanornis from the Jiufotang Formation.

Sarracenia rosea is a species of pitcher plant in the genus Sarracenia and is sometimes known as Burk's Southern Pitcher Plant. It was previously classified as a variety of S. purpurea subsp. venosa (var. burkii). The proposition for the plant to be named a new species arose in 1999. This proposition was based on three main factors: S. rosea has larger flowers on shorter stalks; it produces light pink petals, a feature no other species in the genus exhibits; and it has a somewhat different pitcher structure than S. purpurea.Rice, B.A. 2006. The Carnivorous Plant FAQ: Sarracenia rosea. Accessed 1 June 2007.  A form which lacks anthocyanins has been described as Sarracenia rosea f. luteola.
The species is native to the Southeastern United States Gulf Coast, and has been found from Mississippi to Georgia. However, the areas in which the plant occurs are being developed, so the species's habitat is threatened. However along with Sarracenia psittacina, this species readily colonizes drainage ditches along highways throughout the gulf states providing a somewhat more sustainable albeit less natural habitat.  S. rosea is appreciably more shade-tolerant than the other members of the genus.

Security breach notification laws have been enacted in most U.S. states since 2002. These laws were enacted in response to an escalating number of breaches of consumer databases containing personally identifiable information.State Security Breach Notification Laws
The first such law, the California data security breach notification law SB 1386, Cal. Civ. Code 1798.82 and 1798.29, was enacted in 2002 and became effective on July 1, 2003.SB 1386 Senate Bill As related in the bill statement, law requires "a state agency, or a person or business that conducts business in California, that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information, as defined, to disclose in specified ways, any breach of the security of the data, as defined, to any  resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person." In addition the law permits delayed notification "if a law enforcement agency determines that it would impede a criminal investigation." The law also requires any entity that licenses such information to notify the owner or licensee of the information of any breach in the security of the data.
In general, most state laws follow the basic tenets of California's original law: Companies must immediately disclose a data breach to customers, usually in writing.CSO Online: Interactive map comparing breach notification laws California has since broadened its law to include compromised medical and health insurance information.California AB 1298 (2007)

[[Dolby E]]
CATEGORIES: Digital audio, Audio engineering, Dolby Laboratories

Dolby E is an audio encoding and decoding technology developed by Dolby Laboratories that allows 6 to 8 channels of audio to be compressed into an AES-EBU digital audio stream that can be stored as a standard stereo pair of digital audio tracks.
Up to six channels, such as a 5.1 mix, can be recorded as 16 bit Dolby E data. However, if more than channels are required, such as 5.1 plus a stereo LtRt, the AES3 data must be formatted as 20 bit audio.
It is very important to ensure that a Dolby E stream is never played through monitors or headphones without decoding. Undecoded Dolby E data will be converted to analog as full scale (0 dBfs) digital “noise” that can easily damage loudspeakers and/or hearing. Unambiguous media labeling is essential to avoid this.
Dolby E never reaches home viewers as it is intended for use during post-production when moving multichannel material between production facilities and/or broadcasters. It is decoded prior to transmission.
Dolby E encoding and decoding is implemented using commercially available hardware or software.
Dolby E Hardware Products: 
Dolby DP571, Dolby DP572, Dolby DP600 and Dolby DP600C

Hull City A.F.C., an English association football club based in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, was founded in 1904. The team's first competitive matches came in the FA Cup, being beaten 4–1 by Stockton in a replay following a 3–3 draw,[ref]

 Covers seasons up to and including 2005–06.[/ref] Hull missed out on promotion in the 1909–10 season, having an inferior goal average to Oldham Athletic and finishing in third. The 1929–30 season saw Hull relegated to the Third Division North after 21 seasons in the Second Division while reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Arsenal after a replay. Promotion back to the Second Division was achieved three years later, with the Third Division North championship becoming the club's first major honour. However, they were relegated in the 1935–36 season and it was 13 years before another return to the Second Division was made, when, under the player-management of former England international Raich Carter, the Third Division North title was won. Relegation back to this division came in the 1955–56 season and following League reorganisation implemented for the 1958–59 season Hull won promotion in the Third Division's inaugural season, although they were relegated after one year.
The Third Division championship was won in the 1965–66 season and Hull remained in the Second Division for 12 years before relegation in 1978. Hull reached the semi-final of the Watney Cup in the tournament's inaugural staging in 1970, where they were beaten by Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out; this was the first game in English football to be decided by this method.[ref]

Hull's first play-off campaign ended unsuccessfully, being beaten by Leyton Orient in the semi-final in the 2000–01 season. However, successive promotions in the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons saw Hull rise from the fourth tier to the second tier in a space of two years. After 104 years of existence, Hull were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in their history, beating Watford in the play-off semi-finals and Bristol City in the 2008 Football League Championship play-off Final. Hull's first Premier League season saw safety from relegation ensured on the last day of the season, although the club was relegated the following season after finishing 19th in the league. Three years later, Hull returned to the Premier League after finishing the 2012–13 season as Championship runners-up.
Since their election to the Football League in 1905, Hull have spent 2 seasons in the first tier, 56 in the second, 30 in the third and 10 in the fourth.

[[Hylomorphism (computer science)]]

CATEGORIES: Articles with example Haskell code, Category theory, Recursion schemes

In computer science, and in particular functional programming, a hylomorphism is a recursive function, corresponding to the composition of an anamorphism (which first builds a set of results; also known as 'unfolding') and a catamorphism (which then folds these results into a final return value). Fusion of these two recursive computations into a single recursive pattern then avoids building the intermediate data structure. This is a particular form of the optimizing program transformation techniques collectively known as deforestation. A related type of function is a metamorphism, which is a catamorphism followed by an anamorphism.

St Martha is a hillside, largely wooded, small civil parish in the Guildford borough of Surrey towards the narrower part of the west half of the North Downs.   It includes three homes north of St Martha's Hill, a southern knoll of the range of hills but almost all its population is south of this, in much of the village: Chilworth which is divided between it and Shalford parish.  This results in an overlapping of areas where it is wished to consider the village of Chilworth (being hereto-before considered a hamlet).  Chilworth gunpowder works mark the southern border of the entity, and are a well-preserved, publicly accessible area of bourne-side former industry, which helped to provide much of Surrey's contribution toward the gunpowder for many years of the British Empire.

[[Zavora]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Mozambique

Zavora is a small coastal resort, north east of Maputo in Mozambique, in the district of Inharrime, province of Inhambane. From Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, you drive almost 420km in a north eastern direction to get to Zavora. It is located 27km away from the town of Inharrime and the capital of the province, the city of Inhambane, is approximately 2 hours drive away towards the North East.
The correct Portuguese spelling is Závora, and some maps refer to the area as "Ponta de Závora", Portuguese for "Tip of Zavora" or "Praia de Závora" meaning "Beach of Zavora". The origin of the name Zavora is not known. 
There is also a fish called Zavora-pypvis (Afrikaans language), or translated Zavora-pipefish. The biological name is Halicampus zavorensis from the family Syngnathidae. According to one reference http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=23269 it is a fish found in Western Indian Ocean: known only from one specimen from Zavora, Mozambique and two from Sur, Oman.
The word Zavora is also used as a surname in some languages and therefore the town's name could have originated from a person.
Although the local people can speak Shangaan and Portuguese, the local language is Chopi. English is limited to mostly businesses and lodges.
Zavora is mostly known for its beautiful natural reef and one of few remaining lighthouses along this coast. The reef makes it a popular vacation location and attracks many visitors during holidays, especially, South Africa. There remains some old buildings that still exist from after the Portuguese left Mozambique. These are currently used as accommodation by a local lodge.
In general the local people are poor and needy. Local uplifting projects do exist by missionaries and international organisations. Most of the people make a living from fishing and farming of small crops.
Zavora is also home to one of few remaining lighthouses in Mozambique. The tower of 53 feet was built in 1910 and is still operational with 10sec interval light flashes in aid to passing ships etc. The grounds are open to the public.
According to some reference, a Dutch liner, the MV Klipfontein, struck a submerged reef, 5 miles from Cape Barra near Inhambane on 8 January 1953. In an SA news release this area where the ship sank was referred to as Cape Zavora (Portuguese East Africa) This newsalert doubted that it could have been a submerged reef and referred to it as a hidden 'obstacle'.

The Synagogue of the Priests of Djirt (Hebrew Beit Knesset Kohanim HaDintreisa [tpl]lang-he|בית הכנסת כהנים הדינתרייתא[/tpl]) is a synagogue located in Hara Kabira, (trans: big ghetto), the Jewish neighbourhood located on the outskirts  of Houmt Souk, on the Tunisian island of Djerba.
It is named after the ancient Jewish village of Djirt, modern day Er Riadh, (also known as “Hara Seghira” or the “small ghetto”), which is located a few miles south of Houmt Souk. According to tradition, it was in this village where the first Jews, members of the priestly family of kohanim who were exiled from Jerusalem at the time of the destruction of the first Temple in Jerusalem, settled. The inside is lavishly covered with decorative coloured tiles.
The synagogue is to be distinguished from the El Ghriba synagogue. The El-Ghriba's founding is also traced to the flight of priests from the Roman destruction of the Second Temple, and the legend tells that they brought with them a door of the Temple, which is covered over in a wall of the synagogue.
The B'nai B'rith international Jewish monthly: Volume 115 B'nai B'rith - 2000 Another version of the legend traces El- Ghriba's founding to the flight of kohanim{priests) from Roman destruction of the Second Temple.

HMS ''Starfish'' (19S) was a Group one British S class submarine that was depth charged and sunk by a German minesweeper M7 at Heligoland Bight on 9 January 1940 during the Second World War. Her crew were captured.
HMS Starfish sailed from Blyth for patrol on 5 January 1940. On 9 January, she sighted a German destroyer and attacked it. A communication problem caused the first attack to fail and as the submarine returned to periscope depth to carry out another attack she was attacked by depth charges. Further depth charge attacks forced Starfish to settle on the bottom and wait for the enemy to move on. At 18:15 Starfish returned to the surface, all confidential documents were destroyed and the submarine scuttled. The ship’s company were picked up by the waiting ships and taken as prisoners of war.Submarine losses 1904 to present day, RN Submarine Museum, GosportHMS Starfish, Uboot.net

The UK National Inventory of War Memorials (UKNIWM) was founded in 1989 to build a comprehensive record of every war memorial in the United Kingdom (including England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland). Plus the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
Based at the Imperial War Museum in London, the project has so far recorded around 60,000 war memorials.  This work has largely been carried out by a nation-wide group of volunteer fieldworkers.  Details of over 55,000 memorials are available on the online database.  Further information is stored in a paper archive. 
Details collected include: description, photographs, inscription, location, materials, craftsmen and architects, details of unveiling ceremonies, any repairs or alterations, references and further information about those commemorated.
War memorials are defined as any physical object erected to commemorate both those killed in, or as a result of war, and those who served and returned alive.  This includes memorials to civilian casualties and animals.  While most memorials commemorate the First World War and Second World War, all conflicts are covered, from the Roman Occupation of Britain to current day actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The UKNIWM works to promote the appreciation, use and preservation of war memorials.

[[Marion Partridge]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional characters introduced in 1956, Peyton Place characters

Marion Partridge (née Saltmarsh) is a fictional character in the novel Peyton Place and in the subsequent film adaptation.  In the film, Marion was played by actress Peg Hillias.
Marion Saltmarsh was born an unknown seaside community in New Hampshire, and met her future husband, Charles Partridge, fresh from law school, when he visited her father's Baptist church.  They married, and eventually moved to the community of Peyton Place, where he became the town's most prominent lawyer.  After her marriage, she deserted the Baptists, whom she had been affiliated with since she was a little girl and joined the congregationalists, for she thought that they were the best church in town.  
As she became part of the Peyton Place Community, she became more interested in possessing things, rather than cherishing what she had.  She and Roberta Carter, although the latter didn't live on Chestnut Street, which was the most desirable street in Peyton Place, became best friends.  Marion was well known for being extremely judgmental towards people who didn't meet up to her extremely high standards.  
She had a lot of animosity towards people she didn't necessarily like, most notably Constance MacKenzie and her daughter, Allison.  Marion always believed that she was the paragon of morals and virtue, but in reality, she was extremely cruel to those she didn't like; also she was more than a little bit selfish.  
One of her most frequent enemies was Dr. Matthew Swain, Peyton Place's doctor, who incidentally was one of her husband's closest friends.  She had no liking for his way of telling her the truth.  When he told her something she didn't want to hear, (That she had menopause, and that she was over forty) she demanded that he would no longer be consulted on by her.  Instead, she would rather go to Dr. John Bixby in the nearby town of White River, where she would be told exactly what she wanted to hear. 
Later on, she would viciously gossip about Selena Cross, who had killed her incestuous stepfather, and she was angered that Charles didn't want to prosecute Selena, because she had killed him in self-defense. (He had raped her and would have done so again, had she not killed him) She was one of the few people in Peyton Place who was so angry that Selena was acquitted and she was instrumental in spreading all the talk about her.  To some degree, she was Lucas Cross' only ally, because, characteristically, she selfishly thought of what he had done for her (he had built their kitchen shelves) and not that Selena would have been traumatized again.  
Her role was more expanded in the sequel Return to Peyton Place.  She was instrumental in the vicious firing of Michael Rossi from his job as principal of the Peyton Place Schools, due to his unqualified support of Allison for writing her book, "Samuel's Castle". (The book offended her sensibilities)  Although at first, she worked in concert with Roberta Carter to remove Mr. Rossi, Roberta eventually reversed her decision and rehired him to his position; angering Marion in the end; and this ended their friendship.  
After that, Roberta had been killed by her vicious daughter in-law, Jennifer Burbank Carter, when she pushed her down a flight of stairs, breaking her neck. Obviously, Marion didn't attend her funeral, unless she felt that she had to, as a part of the community.  Again, this kept true to her very selfish nature.
In the 1957 movie, Marion was a member of the school board, and was known for her pettiness; gossiping, and, like the book, was very selfish.  She supposedly saw Allison and her friend Norman Page, swimming in the nude (It had really been Rodney Harrington and Betty Anderson; Allison and Norman were wearing swimming attire) and she had called Constance and Evelyn (Allison and Norman's mothers, respectively) to spread the news.

[[Myland]]
CATEGORIES: Civil parishes in Essex, Colchester

Myland (also called "Mile End") is a civil parish in Essex, England.  It is now a northern suburb of Colchester. The original village began approximately one mile north of the centre of Colchester which probably accounts for its name.  This has varied over the centuries but essentially with the same meaning.  It is the only part of Colchester to be a civil parish.
Myland rises from about 19 metres in the south to about 50 metres in the north.  It is within 30 minutes driving time of Sudbury and Ipswich.
The earliest record of the original village is from 1254 when Mile End became a separate church parish. In the English Civil War, Colonel Fothergill's fort, a major Roundhead stronghold was located in the village. Daniel Defoe held a long lease on Tubswick, an ancient house in the village which burned down on 7 December 2009.  He is said to have leased Tubswick for his daughter.  His book "Moll Flanders" mentions Mile End.
Colchester Borough Council has granted planning consent to two major housing developments in Myland, totalling more than 3,000 homes.  These decisions have provoked strong local opposition. The larger development, of 1,600 homes,"The Gazette, 26 September 2013" is on greenfield land and is to include a new primary school, a new secondary school, a retail area and a community centre, all to be completed by 2021. The smaller development will add some 1,500 new homes on the former Severalls Hospital site, plus a primary school and community centre.
Myland Community Council, founded in 1999, represents the Myland community.  Its clerk and chief financial officer is Helen Harris.  The council is chaired by Pete Hewitt.
The parish has two public houses, 'The Bricklayers' and 'The Dog and Pheasant', as well as three churches/chapels.  These are St. Michael's Parish Church (Church of England), a Methodist chapel and a Catholic church. There are two primary schools, Myland (in Mill Rd) and Queen Boudica (off Turner Rd).  Both Colchester General Hospital and the private Oaks Hospital are to be found in the parish.
Despite its size, Myland has no community centre.
Myland has two areas of playing fields.  Both are owned and maintained by the Borough Council.  To the west, Mile End Playing Fields offer facilities for football and cricket while to the east, Mill Road Playing Fields are home to Colchester Rugby Club, supporting rugby union, cricket and archery.
Colchester United F.C.'s ground, The Weston Homes Community Stadium, is on the Cuckoo Farm/Severalls development in the north of the parish.

Just as the DVB-H and 1seg are mobile TV extensions to the DVB-T and ISDB-T terrestrial digital TV standards respectively, ATSC-M/H is an extension to the available digital TV broadcasting standard ATSC A/53. ATSC is optimized for a fixed reception in the typical North American environment and uses 8VSB modulation. The ATSC transmission scheme is not robust enough against doppler shift and multipath radio interference in mobile environments, and is designed for highly directional fixed antennas. To overcome these issues, additional channel coding mechanisms are introduced in ATSC-M/H to protect the signal.

The mildew of any late season, of any experience that has grown monotonous as, for instance, the experience of life.Quoted in Penso, p. 13  Harold Bloom responds: "Stevens, with only rare exceptions, did not comment very usefully upon his own poems. This is not one of the exceptions."Quoted in Penso, p. 12.  Bloom suggests that  the poet feels acutely the universal nostalgia that he is now a touch old to be what clearly he never was, a "princox", a roaring boy or saucy fellow....What the poem shows...is Stevens' anxiety that the poetic voice in him may fail, an anxiety rendered more acute by an imaginative maturity so long delayed."Quoted in Penso, p. 13. 
Challenging Bloom's interpretation, Kia Penso writes, "There is no evidence in the letters or elsewhere to suggest that Stevens suffered from the kind of anxiety that Bloom ascribes to him.".Penso, p. 14. (Evidently she does not consider "Monocle de Mon Oncle" to be such evidence.) She calls Bloom to account for reading the line that begins with "Pardie!" and the following lines "as being about Stevens himself feeling fat and old. And green."Penso, p. 13. The implication is that Bloom's reading absurdly transfers a property attributed to summer, greenness, to Stevens. More generally, reading the subject of the poem as Stevens's anxieties about himself, rather than being about summer and a poetic response to it, is egregious. (Compare the exchange between Joan Richardson and Helen Vendler about "Monocle".)
Line 10 has been explicated by Eleanor Cook as referring punningly to earwigs despoiling ears of corn, though the role of Satan remains elusive.

Abraham Auerbach (born at Bouxweiler, Alsace, in the middle of the 18th century; died at Bonn, November 3, 1846) was a German rabbi.
A descendant of an old rabbinical family, he was destined from his childhood for the rabbinate, and was educated first by his grandfather at Worms, and later by his uncle, Joseph David Sinzheim, subsequently president of the Central Consistory at Paris. Under the latter's direction, Auerbach acquired not only extensive Talmudic knowledge, but a secular education as well. When, owing to the efforts of Samson Cerfberr of Medelsheim, a Jewish community had been formed at Strasbourg, Auerbach was charged with its administration.
At the outbreak of the Reign of Terror in France, Auerbach, on account of his connection with Cerfberr (who as former contractor to the royal army was suspected by the revolutionists), was thrown into prison where he remained for a year. On leaving Strasbourg he was appointed rabbi at Forbach, then at Neuwied, and in 1809 at Bonn. In 1837 he resigned the position, ostensibly on account of his great age, but really to have his son succeed him in his place.
Auerbach was the author of several liturgical poems and prayers, and of a poem on the abolition of the poll tax, entitled Dibre ha-Mekes we-Beṭuloh (History of the Tax and its Abolition), still extant in manuscript. The poem was dedicated to Cerfberr, who by his intervention brought about the abolition. A specimen of the poem was given by Samuel Joseph Fuenn, who was the possessor of the manuscript.
Auerbach left seven sons, among whom the best known was Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, rabbi at Darmstadt and Halberstadt.

[[Desert fungi]]

CATEGORIES: Fungi

A variety of terricolous fungi inhabit the biological soil crust of arid regions. Those exposed to the sun typically contain melanin and are resistant to high temperatures, dryness and low nutrition. Species that are common elsewhere (e.g. Penicillium spp. and common soil Aspergillus spp.) do not thrive in these conditions. Producing large dark unicellular spores also helps survival. Sexually reproducing ascomycetes, especially Chaetomium spp., have developed resilience by growing thick, dark perithecia. Under desert shrubs, however, more sensitive species such as Gymnoascus reesii prevail.Grishkan, I., E. Zaady & E. Nevo.

Samson Cerfberr of Medelsheim (born at Strasburg about 1780; committed suicide at Paris, 1826) was a French soldier and author.
He led an erratic and adventurous life, wandering over the world, changing his name and even his religion several times. At one time he is disguised as a Muslim with the name of "Ibrahim Manṣur Effendi", serving in the Turkish army; at another he is found holding office in Westphalia under the name of "Medelsheim".
In 1813, he took on the name Ibrahim Cerfberovic[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] and fought against the Serbians in Bosnia serving alongside men such as Osman Gradaščević while serving in the district of Zvornik; the Serbs were eventually defeated after the arrival of the Ottoman Grand Vizier Hursid Pasha in 1813.

HD 11964 c is an extrasolar planet approximately 107 light-years away in the constellation of Cetus.  The planet was discovered in a close-orbit around the yellow subgiant star HD 11964.  The planet has a minimum mass 35 times the mass of Earth and is located in a mildly eccentric orbit which takes almost 38 days to complete. HD 11964 c was a possible planet discovered on the same day as HD 11964 b in 2005. HD 11964 c was first proposed in a paper published in 2007,[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/657/1/533/65907.html | title=Four New Exoplanets and Hints of Additional Substellar Companions to Exoplanet Host Stars | author=Wright, J.T. et al. | year=2007 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=657 | issue=1 | pages=533–545 | doi=10.1086/510553 | bibcode=2007ApJ...657..533W|arxiv = astro-ph/0611658 [/tpl] and finally confirmed with new data presented in a review of multi-planet systems which appeared on the arXiv preprint website in 2008.

[[EST and The Forum in popular culture]]
CATEGORIES: Human Potential Movement, Topics in popular culture

Werner Erhard and his self-improvement courses have been referenced in popular culture in various forms of fictional media including literature, film, television and theatre.  These courses, known as est, were delivered by the company Erhard Seminars Training (EST, or est). Under the name The Forum, they were delivered by Werner Erhard and Associates.  Also, the Landmark Forum, a program created by Erhard's former employees after purchasing his intellectual property, has had an influence on popular culture.  Some of these works have taken a comedic tack, parodying Erhard and satirizing the methodology used in these courses. Other works have taken a more direct approach, and analyzed and questioned Erhard's early life and controversy through fictionalized accounts.
Both est and The Forum have been depicted more often in film and television than in literary works.  The 1977 film Semi-Tough satirized Erhard and the est Training, through the fictional "Bismark Earthwalk Action Training."  Bert Convy portrayed the Erhard parody character. est students Diana Ross and Joel Schumacher incorporated Werner Erhard's teachings into the 1978 musical film, The Wiz.  The 1990 film The Spirit of '76 also parodied est, where Rob Reiner portrayed an abusive trainer for the est-like "Be, Inc. Seminars."  Movie critics have also drawn parallels to est and Werner Erhard, in reviews of the films Fight Club and Magnolia. Concepts from the Landmark Forum were utilized by the The Wachowskis in their film The Matrix Revolutions. Werner Erhard's training programs have been parodied in television. The 1979 episode of  Mork & Mindy, "Mork Goes Erk", and the 2002 episode of Six Feet Under, "The Plan", are the most notable. In the Mork & Mindy episode, the Erhard parody character was played by David Letterman.
Madison, Wisconsin's Broom Street Theater produced a play about Werner Erhard and The Forum in 1995, called Devil In Paradise, The Fall and Rise of Werner Erhard.  This piece presented a fictionalized version of controversial issues surrounding Erhard.

CATEGORIES: Figure skating elements

A Besti squat is a figure skating move. It is similar to the spread eagle in that the skater travels along an edge with both skates on the ice, the toes turned out to the sides and the heels facing each other. The knees are bent outwards into a squatting position with the thighs held parallel to the ice and the torso kept upright.
In ballet terminology, it is a plié with the feet in second position.
The move is unofficially named after Natalia Bestemianova, who performed the move repeatedly in her 1988 free dance with Andrei Bukin.Time Magazine article on 1988 OlympicsNew York Times article on 1988 Olympics

Likened to Ween, The Raspberries and The Magnetic Fields, they have released a number of records on Polyholiday records, the most ambitious being the six-CD box set A Century of Song, which was released in 2004. The album covered 100 songs recorded in the 20th century in chronological order, eschewing canonical choices in favour of tracks such as "So What", "Do the Freddie", and "Lucas with the Lid Off". The Village Voice said, "There's no way any normal person would want to sit through all six CDs of A Century of Song".http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0520,matos,64004,22.html
The band are currently recording their next project, rumored to be a ten-CD box set, covering everything The Beatles recorded, in chronological order.

Leacock was born in 1922 in New Jersey. Her mother Lily was a mathematician and her father was the literary critic, philosopher, and writer Kenneth Burke. Leacock did her undergraduate work at Barnard CollegeBiographical note for Leacock, Eleanor, Women's Status in Egalitarian Society: Implications for Social Evolution, in Current Anthropology, vol. 33, no. 1, supp. Inquiry and Debate in the Human Sciences: Contributions from Current Anthropology, 1960–1990 (Feb., 1992 (ISSN 00113204 & E-ISSN 15375382)), p. 225 (essay originally appeared in Current Anthropology, vol. 19, no. 2 (Jun., 1978)). and Radcliffe College and completed her graduate training at Columbia University. She married film maker Richard Leacock in 1941. They had four children. The marriage broke up in 1962. Her second husband (from 1966) was Civil Rights and Union activist James Haughton.James Haughton, the son of West Indian immigrants was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 8, 1929. His papers are at the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/scm/schaught.xml. 
She is known for her ethnographic work in Labrador with the Montagnais-Naskapi people, influenced by William Duncan Strong. During this 1950 study, she found the Montagnais-Naskapi's life was changed due to the fur trade.Moore Visions of Culture AltaMira Press: 2004.
She was at Bank Street College of Education as Senior Research Associate, 1958–1965, and at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in the social sciences department, 1963–1972. She struggled to get a full-time job. She taught as an adjunct for decades before taking a full-time job as a professor of anthropology at City College and Graduate Faculty of City University of New York in 1972. Her appointment occurred after writing her celebrated introduction to Frederick Engels' The Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State. She resuscitated Engels' theory that linked the domination of women to the rise of classes and the state in which he termed as "the historic defeat of the female sex."Engels, Frederick, 1972 1888, Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State, NY: International Publishers, pp. 120-121.
One of Leacock's most fruitful contributions to the field of anthropology was her essay entitled, "Interpreting the Origins of Gender Inequality: Conceptual and Historical Problems" (1983). Throughout this essay, she discusses gender inequalities.  
Leacock died in 1987 in Hawai'i.

CATEGORIES: Birds of Australia, Gerygone

The Brown Gerygone (Gerygone mouki), previously known as the Brown Warbler, is a small passerine bird native to eastern coastal Australia. The upper parts of the Brown Gerygone are a deep olive-grey or olive-brown, while its face and underparts are a much paler grey, cream, or washed-out brown. The tail feathers are dark and may be white-tipped. It is approximately 10 cm in length.
The Brown Gerygone has a relatively large range. Although total population trends have not been quantified, it is considered of "least concern" by the IUCN.
It may be sighted in coastal rainforest, singly or in small groups of two to four. It feeds on insects. The Brown Gerygone call is a soft what-is-it.
It is not closely related to either true Old World Warblers or the New World Warblers, but belongs rather to the Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines, as well as crows.
The Brown Gerygone is similar to both the Large-billed, G. magnirostris, and Mangrove,G. levigaster, Gerygones. It differs from the former by having a distinctive white eyebrow and a grey-tinged face. The Mangrove Gerygone, while having a white eyebrow, lacks the grey face, has more white on the flanks and has a redder eye.

[[Dracut High School]]

CATEGORIES: Schools in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, Public high schools in Massachusetts

Dracut Senior High School is the public senior high school in the Merrimack Valley town of Dracut, Massachusetts.
The high school's colors are Columbia blue, navy blue, silver and white. The team name is the Middies and the symbol is an anchor, except for in Football where the logo is a "Lightning Sword".  These are references to midshipmen, as historically, the town was a place where U.S. Navy uniforms were created. The original Dracut High was built in the early 1950s and was frequently overcrowded, as roughly 1,600 students attend the school that was built for a fraction of that number, approximately 900. However, in 2011, the state approved funding to construct a new Dracut High School. The majority of the project was constructed in 2013; with the project anticipated for completion in August 2014. Sophomores, juniors and seniors at the school are using the new building; but due to construction, freshmen are using a wing of the Lakeview Junior High School, next door, through the end of the 2013-14 school year. [tpl]cite web|title=Dracut High School Renovation Project|url=http://dracutps.org/dracut-high-school/high-school-renovation-project|accessdate=13 September 2012[/tpl] 
Dracut High School is well known in the Merrimack Valley for their marching band and color guard, and also for their Show Choir, A Cappella Vocal Ensemble, the A Cappellicans (which performs at many inside and outdoor venues throughout the year) and general music department.The high school is also very well known for its Spring Musical that is performed each April. The Music Department has received numerous awards for their productions. 
Dracut High's Football team won the 2008 Division II State Championship on the back of their quarterback, Matt Grimard, who was selected as the Massachusetts Gatorade Player of the Year for 2008. The football team also made the playoffs in 2009 & 2010, but lost in the Semi-Finals both years.
The school was the first in Massachusetts to ban iPods and other electronic devices during school hours. This set a precedent that has been followed by 14 other schools, including Acton-Boxboro, Cohasset, Gloucester, and Durfee.
Dracut High School is surrounded by 3 other schools: the Lakeview Junior High School, George H. Englesby Intermediate School and Brookside Elementary School.

[[List of Connecticut tornadoes]]
CATEGORIES: Tornadoes in Connecticut, Connecticut-related lists, Tornado-related lists

Although historically the U.S. state of Connecticut is not typically known to fall casualty to tornadoes, more than 100 of these powerful storms have affected the state in modern history, resulting in at least 48 deaths, 780 injuries, and more than $500 million in damage.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~storms|title= NCDC Storm Events|accessdate= 2008-05-13|year= 2008|publisher= National Climatic Data Center[/tpl]Tornado Safety Rules Worth Reviewing Hartford Courant Online. Accessed 2008-05-13. This list of tornadoes in the state is likely incomplete, as official records date back only to 1950 for tornadoes in the United States.
As with most of the northeastern United States, the number of tornadoes peaks in the summer months, normally in July or August. Hartford County has had the most tornadoes in the state, although since 1950 Litchfield County has reported the most tornadoes. Several areas have been struck more than once, and Waterbury has been struck by no less than four tornadoes since 1955.
From 1953 to 1991, Connecticut recorded an average of about 1.3 tornadoes per year, ranked 43rd in the United States.Grazulis, p. 18 Although Connecticut tornadoes are typically weak, isolated events can be violent. Three tornadoes of F4 intensity have affected the state in its history, as well as at least 27 tornadoes of F2 intensity or greater. Outbreaks of three or more tornadoes in a single day occurred in 1786, 1787, 1878, 1973, 1989, 1998, and 2001. The year 1973 was particularly active; eight tornadoes occurred on six separate days. The 1878 Wallingford tornado killed at least 29 and likely 34 people in Wallingford, the most by any tornado event in Connecticut history.

[[Milton Harris (scientist)]]

CATEGORIES: 1906 births, 1991 deaths, American chemists, Oregon State University alumni

Milton Harris (March 21, 1906—September 12, 1991) was a scientist who founded the Harris Research Laboratories and, for six years, chaired the Board of Directors of the American Chemical Society.
Harris was born in Los Angeles, California and raised in Portland, Oregon. His first independent business enterprise, at the age of twelve or thirteen, was building crystal radio sets. A high school science course piqued his interest in chemistry. In 1924, at the age of sixteen, Harris began his college education at Oregon State University, then known as Oregon Agricultural College (OAC). Despite the lack of a chemistry department at that time, Harris pursued a degree in chemical engineering and took all available courses in chemistry.
At the age of 18, Harris graduated from OAC, and began graduate work at Yale University. Upon his graduation from Yale in 1929, Harris took his first job as a chemist at the Cheney Brothers Mill. Harris was called away from Cheney in 1931 to join a new textile research group at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). Harris was later appointed director of the research group, which would ultimately produce roughly 200 scientific papers on various aspects of textile chemistry. While he was at the NBS Harris, along with Vincent du Vigneaud, made important discoveries with regard to similarities between the three-dimensional molecular structures of wool, insulin, and human hair.
With the beginning of US involvement in World War II, Harris’ group began advising the Army Quartermaster about textiles, as well as helping to solve a myriad of problems for the NBS. Harris aided the research and redesign of sandbag sacking, tent cloth, and the chemical additives in military underwear that were used to protect soldiers from the effects of a gas attack. At the end of World War II, while the Textile Foundation was relocated to Princeton, New Jersey, Harris elected to stay in Washington, D.C. With the help of some colleagues, Harris started the Harris Research Laboratories, which operated as a consulting laboratory for the Gillette Company and American Enka Company, among others.
Harris’ association with the Gillette Company grew with the development of his consulting business.  In 1955, Gillette bought the Harris Research Laboratories and appointed Harris Vice President of Research. Just before his retirement from Gillette in 1966, Milton Harris was approached by the American Chemical Society (ACS) Board of Directors and asked if he would accept a nomination to the board.  He accepted and served as head for six years. In 1975 Harris headed an ACS panel which produced a study instrumental to the National Academy of Sciences’ recommendation for widespread cultivation of the jojoba shrub.
Harris was the recipient of many major honors in the field of chemistry, including the Harold DeWitt Smith Memorial Medal (1966), the Perkin Medal (1970), and the Priestley Medal (1980). He died of cancer September 12, 1991. His papers were donated to Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections in November 1995.

Larbre Compétition is a French auto racing team founded in 1988 by Jack Leconte.  Based at the Circuit du Val de Vienne in La Vigeant, Larbre has had considerable success in the Porsche Carrera Cup, French GT Championship, and international FIA GT Championship.  Previously working with major automobile manufacturers like Porsche, Ferrari, and Chrysler, Larbre ran one of the factory Aston Martin squads in the Le Mans Series where they won the 2006 GT1 class championship.
For 2008 Larbre chose to enlist Saleen S7-Rs for the Le Mans Series and FFSA GT Championship. The team continued with the GT1 Saleens during the 2009 LMS season, but ACO denied an entry from them for the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans.
For 2010 Larbre competed once again with the 10-year old Saleen S7-R in the Le Mans Series, with drivers Fernando Rees, Gabriele Gardel and Patrice Goueslard.  In 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans the team took the last ever LMGT1 class win with the aging Saleen S7-R, as well championship victories from both Le Mans Series and Intercontinental Le Mans Cup.
In 2011 the GT1 class got axed from ACO-sanctioned racing, and the old GT2 category (renamed as GTE) became the premier GT class. The team entered a Chevrolet Corvette C6.R into the GTE-Am division of the Le Mans Series and 24 Hours of Le Mans. The team won the GTE-Am category of the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans with the Corvette and also took the second place with Porsche GT3 RSR. They also won the ILMC GTE-AM championship and thus became the first team to win a professional championship with a GT2-spec Corvette C6.R.
For 2012, Larbre will compete in the FIA World Endurance Championship with two GTE-Am class Corvette C6.Rs.

CIEL-FM is a French-language Canadian radio station located in Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec.
Owned and operated by Radio CJFP (1986) ltée (part of the Groupe Radio Simard), it broadcasts on 103.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 60,000 watts using an omnidirectional antenna (class C).  The station has an adult contemporary format under the CIEL branding. However, the station has some oldies programming, during weekends.
The station was originally known as CJFP and went on the air on April 13, 1947 Larouche, Marc.  "CJFP devient CIEL-FM", Le Soleil, May 7, 2001, pg. A-4. as an AM station broadcasting on 1400 kHz.  From 1984 until the station's move to FM in 1994, it was one of the few AM stations authorized to increase its power at night, due to NARBA amendments which authorized all stations on "graveyard" (class C) channels to quadruple their nighttime power.  CJFP actually became the most powerful station in all of North America among those stations, as it was authorized to broadcast with 10,000 watts during the day and 20,000 watts (directional) at night;Decision CRTC 84-1031 however, this did not actually result in good coverage at night due to massive co-channel interference.Decision CRTC 94-736  The FM signal went on the air on December 15, 1994 Former Canadian AM stations, by Kit Sage and the AM signal went off the air in June 1995.
Because the station already had an FM sister station, namely CIBM-FM (at the time, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations generally forbade broadcasters to operate more than one AM station and one FM station per market), CJFP-FM originally operated under a condition of licence which required at least half of the programming to be "spoken-word programming" (i.e., talk radio).  As such, CJFP-FM became the first privately owned French-language FM station to broadcast mainly talk programming; most of that talk programming came from the Radiomédia network.  The station abandoned most of its talk programming, adopting a full-time adult contemporary format, and changed its call sign to CIEL-FM, effective September 1, 2001.  That call sign was used, until August 2000, on a Montreal-area station now known as CHMP-FM, which coincidentally now has a talk format.

RTÉ Gold is an Irish radio station broadcasting on DAB and Saorview Ireland's free to air DTT service. It can also be accessed on the internet via the RTÉ website. The station plays classic hits from top-selling artists spanning the decades from the 1950s to the 1980s.  A particular feature of the current scheduling on RTÉ Gold is the inclusion, next to hits, of album tracks not normally available in a competitive classic hits format.

It formerly known as The Magic Carpet Ride, and began broadcasting on RTÉ Gold in March 2008. The programme specialises in playing music from the 1960s, with an average show consisting of a mixture of the fairly well known and the relatively obscure. The idea behind the programme is to give the listener a different perspective on the music from this particular decade. After a break of a few months, TTLG began airing again at the beginning of May 2009.

Hyperconnectivity is also a trend in computer networking in which all things that can or should communicate through the network will communicate through the network. This encompasses person-to-person, person-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication. The trend is fueling large increases in bandwidth demand and changes in communications because of the complexity, diversity and integration of new applications and devices using the network.
The communications equipment maker Nortel has recognized hyperconnectivity as a pervasive and growing market condition that is at the core of their business strategy. CEO Mike Zafirovski and other executives have been quoted extensively in the press referring to the hyperconnected era.

According to Albrecht Powell, the Pennsylvania Amish are not the largest group of U.S. Amish as is commonly thought. The Amish have settled in as many as twenty-four states, Canada, and Central America, though about 80% are located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. The greatest concentration of Amish is in Holmes and adjoining counties in northeast Ohio, about 100 miles from Pittsburgh. Next in size is a group of Amish people in Elkhart and surrounding counties in northeastern Indiana. Then comes the Amish settlement in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Amish population in the U.S. numbers more than 270,000 and is growing rapidly, due to large family size (seven children on average) and a church-member retention rate of approximately 80%."[tpl]cite web|last=Powell|first=Albrecht|title=Amish 101 - Amish Beliefs, Culture & Lifestyle, History of the Amish in America,|url=http://pittsburgh.about.com/cs/pennsylvania/a/amish.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=2012[/tpl]

[[1981 St. Louis Cardinals season]]
CATEGORIES: St. Louis Cardinals seasons, 1981 Major League Baseball season

The St. Louis Cardinals 1981 season was the team's 100th season in St. Louis, Missouri and the 90th season in the National League.  1981 was a season of two significant anomalies:  A change in the playoff format, which created the first-ever Divisional Series with a qualification variant that existed only for that season, and the players' strike, which truncated the regular season.  Despite finishing 59-43, good for the best overall record in the National League East, the strike set up the scenario where the Cardinals actually missed the playoffs.  The regular season was split into halves to tally teams' records separately in each half of the season, and because the Cardinals finished in second place in each half, they did not qualify for the 1981 playoffs.  Major League Baseball reverted to the previous playoff format the following season, and the Cardinals qualified for that postseason.
First baseman Keith Hernandez won a Gold Glove this year.

[[Reversing (vehicle maneuver)]]

Reversing (also known as backing up) is the process of driving a vehicle in the reverse direction in order to maneuver.  Rear view mirrors are standard equipment for this endeavor.  Extremely large or luxury vehicles may have in addition technical aids such as backup cameras.  Many industrial vehicles such as fork lifts automatically activate a warning beep whilst reversing.
Reversing a vehicle can serve the purpose of changing lanes in traffic when a driver wishes to change to an adjacent lane but the destination lane is relatively jammed with vehicles (backed up). This is performed by driving in the reverse direction until the vehicle can move into the adjacent lane (or adjacent lanes) at the back of the queue in the next lane.

CATEGORIES: Racing video games, Video game franchises, Video games developed in Japan, Yanoman games

Runabout is a series of destruction-themed driving games developed by Climax Entertainment. Games in this series have been released on PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Dreamcast and Nintendo 3DS. Runabout's main missions consist of the player driving from point A to point B in order to pick up or deliver an item. The first game had more than one map to choose from, whereas the later ones utilized one city map modeled after an actual location—San Francisco in Super Runabout (Dreamcast) and New York in Runabout 3 Neo Age (PlayStation 2).
Players start off with just a few vehicles. When players complete a mission, destroy as much as they can, or drive without damaging anything, they are rewarded with a new vehicle. In the newer games, players are also rewarded with paint jobs and special abilities for each individual vehicle.
Although made in Japan, all games in the series feature mostly English text and dialogue regardless of the region. Vehicles across all games include a pickup truck, NSR (Honda NSX), F1 car, tank, and various novelty vehicles such as the RCC (radio-controlled car).

Luraine Tansey (née Collins) (born Manhattan, Kansas) is an American slide librarian who created the first Universal Slide Classification System in 1969 with Wendell Simons.
Tansey worked to develop a "universal" slide classification scheme that would serve the needs of both catalogers and patrons.  Co-authored by Wendell Simons, it was published in 1969 under the title, A slide classification system for the organization and automatic indexing of interdisciplinary collections of slides and pictures.  Created mostly during her tenure at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the late 1960s-early 1970s, this system is still in use at UCSC and other institutions and is known as the Tansey or Santa Cruz system. This system was also built with computer indexing in mind. 
Tansey worked with the College Art Association (CAA) for the benefit of librarians and image librarians. Her work contributed to the eventual founding of two professional societies, the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) and the Visual Resources Association (VRA). In 1993 she received both the VRA and ARLIS/NA's Distinguished Service Awards. In 1993, Tansey underwrote the VRA Travel Awards Program; several Luraine Tansey Travel Awards are still awarded each year.

The Alabama Cooperative Extension System (Alabama Extension) provides educational outreach to the citizens of Alabama on behalf of the state's two land grant universities: Alabama A&M University (state's 1890 land-grant institution) and Auburn University (1862 land-grant institution)."2004 Highlights," Alabama Cooperative Extension System.
The System employs more than 800 faculty, professional educators, and staff members operating in offices in every one of Alabama’s 67 counties and in nine urban centers covering the major regions of the state."2003 Annual Report," Alabama Cooperative Extension SystemHenderson, Chinella "Urban Centers," Metro News, Alabama Cooperative Extension System. In conjunction with the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, the system also staffs six Extension and Research Centers located in the state’s principal geographic regions.
Since 2004, "Alabama Extension" has functioned primarily as a regionally-based System in which the bulk of educational programming is delivered by agents operating across a multi-county area and specializing in specific fields. County Extension coordinators and county agents (where they are funded), continue to play integral roles in the Extension mission, working with regional agents and other Extension personnel to deliver services to clients within their areas.
Alabama Extension, which will mark its centennial in 2014, possesses a history deeply rooted in the impoverished post-Civil War conditions of the rural Deep South. When the foundations of Extension work were being initiated in the state, Alabama was still reeling from the lingering economic dislocation and deprivation associated with post-war conditions.Yeager, Joseph and Stevenson, Gene, "Inside Ag Hill: The People and Events That Shaped Auburn's Agricultural History from 1872 through 1999", Chelsea, Michigan: Sheridan Books, 1999, p.21 A major focus of Extension work at that time was on using cutting-edge research from the state’s expanding land-grant university system in tandem with emerging Industrial Age technologies to improve the working conditions of the state’s farmers and homemakers."Taking the University to the People: 2000 Annual Report," Alabama Cooperative Extension System
Today, Alabama Extension faces many of the challenges common among Extension programs in other states, namely addressing and expanding its mission to account for the needs of a state that is becoming increasingly affluent, urbanized and racially and ethnically diverse. While many of Alabama  Extension’s priority programs are targeted to traditional audiences in rural parts of the state, there is an increasing emphasis on reaching nontraditional clients in urban areas."How Extension Works for You," Alabama Cooperative Extension System.
Moreover, capitalizing on rapid advances in communications technologies, Alabama Extension, like many of its counterparts in other states, is expanding its mission to reach regional, national, and global audiences.

CATEGORIES: St. Louis Cardinals seasons, 1968 Major League Baseball season, National League champion seasons

The 1968 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 87th season in St. Louis, Missouri and its 77th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 97-65 during the season, winning their second consecutive NL pennant, this time by nine games over the San Francisco Giants. They lost in 7 games to the Detroit Tigers in the 1968 World Series. The Cardinals would not return to postseason until 1982.
Following the season, Major League Baseball announced plans to split both the National and American Leagues into East and West divisions starting with the 1969 season in order to accommodate the inclusion of two new franchises to each league. The Cardinals were assigned to the new National League East division.  Originally, the Cardinals were placed in the National League West division.  However, the New York Mets, wanting to compensate for the loss of home games against the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, desired three extra games against the Cardinals, the two-time defending NL champions.  The Cardinals were thus moved to the National League East division along with the Chicago Cubs, who wished to maintain their long-standing rivalry with the Cardinals.  The Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds were correspondingly shifted to the National League West despite both being east of St. Louis and Chicago, a configuration maintained until 1993.

First script was more related to the canon novel (Monday Begins on Saturday) and was in fact an intention to make its screen version, with some new storylines though, but Bromberg didn't like it and Strugatsky Brothers wrote absolutely new script from scratch. History later repeated with another film by Sokurov "Days of Eclipse" (Dni zatmeniya).

In 2004 she earned her MFA from the Umeå Academy of Fine Arts in 2004, and her recent awards include artist-in-residence at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts http://www.bemiscenter.org in Omaha, Nebraska (2007), the IASPIS International Exchange (2006), a Swedish Visual Arts Fund Project Grant http://www.konstnarsnamnden.se/k_info/info_eng.html (2005), NIFCA Nordic Air Residency http://www.nifca.org/2006/residencies/programs/nordicair.html in Tallinn, Estonia (2005) and two grants from the JC Kempes Foundation http://www.umeastudentkar.se/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=101&Itemid=39 (2003/2004). Together with Po Hagstrom, Holmstedt is part of artist duo Trial and Error http://www.trialerror.org/Monument/index.html, working with projects related to national identity and the use of public space. Holmstedt also co-founded SQUID http://www.squid-net.com/, an online project which facilitates a space for the parallel knowledge that emerges from an investigative, creative process.
Janna Holmstedt works with image, text, video and installation, usually in relation to a specific site and/or situation. She employs storytelling as a tool for critical engagement and as a way to deal with and make sense of the constant flow of information in everyday life. In her work, she seeks to situate a subject within a context that is not framed as an absolute truth or stable reality, but rather as a system that unfolds through a specific network where meanings are constructed. In her video- and sound installations involving voice-overs, Holmstedt focuses on the tension between an existentially defined "inner" space and that which we typically perceive as an "outer" space of politics and everyday life. She finds the borderland where these two fields meet, collide and interact - that is, where our sense of individuality and reality is represented - as the most interesting to investigate.

[[Elke]]

CATEGORIES: 1999 singles, Die Ärzte songs, German songs, Songs written by Farin Urlaub

"Elke" is a punk song by Die Ärzte. It's the seventh track from their 1988 album Das ist nicht die ganze Wahrheit.... The song's lyrics were inspired by an overweight fan and depict a fictitious love story between Urlaub and the eponymous fan.
The music is unique, as the first verse is sung slowly and then the song goes to the chorus very abruptly and then progresses with fast singing. This makes it a live favourite, as witnessed by the inclusion of 1988 live version to Das Beste von kurz nach früher bis jetze and the single of 1999.
It's also the twenty-second track on CD2 from their 1999 live album Wir wollen nur deine Seele. "Die Schönen und das Biest" (The Beauties and the Beast) is the title of the single that was released to promote the album. The single is not the one featured on the album, which is much longer. The single version is from a concert at Rock am Ring (18 May 1997).

[[Multi-currency pricing]]

CATEGORIES: Financial terminology

Multi-currency pricing (MCP) is a financial service which allows businesses to price goods and services in a variety of foreign currencies, while continuing to receive settlement and reporting in their home currency. With MCP, merchants can sell the same item to British customers in pounds sterling, French and German customers in Euros, and Japanese customers in Yen. A sales tool that helps merchants expand into other sectors of the global marketplace, MCP allows cardholders to shop, view prices and pay in the currency of their choice. Currently this feature is available for Visa and MasterCard networks only.
For example, a Japanese consumer browsing a US-based web-site with MCP functionality may view prices in US dollars, or in Japanese Yen. The consumer is then given the option to pay in the currency of his or her choice. If the customer chooses to pay in Yen, this service guarantees that this exact Japanese yen amount will be debited to the cardholder account, and the exact US dollar amount will be credited to the merchant's account. The cardholder is not charged any additional fees for this service.
Among the biggest advantages to merchants according to proponents:
The MCP solution is mostly found in card not present (internet, mail-order/telephone-order) environments, but can also be used as a terminal application in card present (POS) environments.

[[Gokyo Ri]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Nepal

Gokyo Ri, aka Gokyo Peak (5,357 m, 17,575 ft above sea level), is a peak in the Khumbu region of the Nepal Himalayas. It is located on the west side of the Ngozumpa glacier, which is the largest glacier in Nepal and reputed to be the largest in the whole Himalayas. Gokyo (4,750 m, 15,583 ft above sea level), at the base of Gokyo Ri, is a small hamlet of a few stone houses and one of the highest settlements in the world. From Gokyo Ri it is possible to see five 8,000-metre peaks: Mount Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Kangchenjunga, and Cho Oyu. The Gokyo Lakes are in the area.
The Gokyo trek is a fairly popular trekking route. The route itself ends at Gokyo Ri, and trekkers typically turn around at this point and retrace their steps back to the trailhead. There is an alternative mountaineering route that begins near the southern tip of Ngozumpa Glacier and just south of Taujun Lake. This alternative route leads east over the Cho La, a pass at 5,420 m (17,782 ft), where it meets with the main Everest Base Camp trek.
There is another higher summit just north of where the main Gokyo trek route ends. It stands at an altitude of [tpl]convert|5483|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level.

CATEGORIES: 1927 births, 2003 deaths, Politicians from Los Angeles, California, California Republicans, John Birch Society, Members of the United States House of Representatives from California, American people of French descent, Principia College alumni, American anti-communists, John Birch Society members

John Harbin Rousselot (November 1, 1927 – May 11, 2003) was a U.S. Representative from southern California. (Although the territory he represented was generally the same, in eastern Los Angeles County, the district was renumbered several times during his congressional career.)
Born in 1927 in Los Angeles, California, Rousselot attended the public schools of San Marino and South Pasadena. He received a B.A. from Principia College, Elsah, Illinois, in 1949, and went to work as an insurance agent. During the 1950s he also was an author and public relations consultant.
From 1954 to 1955, Rousselot served as assistant to the public relations director of Pacific Finance Corp., Los Angeles, California. He served as deputy to the chairman of the California Board of Equalization in 1956, and was director of public information for the Federal Housing Administration in Washington, D.C., from 1958 to 1960.
Rousselot resigned his position at the FHA to return to southern California to run for Congress. His first notable political activity had been as a delegate to the 1956 Republican National Convention, and he had served as a member of the executive committee of the California Republican State Central Committee in 1956–57.
Rousselot was elected as a Republican to the Eighty-seventh Congress (January 3, 1961 – January 3, 1963) from California's 25th congressional district, defeating Democratic incumbent George A. Kasem. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the Eighty-eighth Congress in 1962, losing to Democrat Ronald B. Cameron.
During the next few years, Rousselot worked as a management consultant and also served as Western regional director of the ultraconservative John Birch Society. His longtime association with this group was a continuing source of controversy throughout his career in elective office.  One of his allies during this time was Rev. Billy James Hargis.http://thislandpress.com/11/02/2012/the-strange-love-of-dr-billy-james-hargis/
Rousselot was elected to the Ninety-first Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Representative Glenard P. Lipscomb in California's 24th congressional district, and reelected to the six succeeding Congresses (June 30, 1970 – January 3, 1983). In the Republican primary for the 1970 special election, he narrowly edged out former congressman Patrick Hillings and former football star and doctor Bill McColl. In the special general election he handily defeated Democrat Myrlie Evers, the widow of assassinated civil rights activist Medger Evers. The district still was numbered the 24th when he won full terms in 1970 and 1972, but a 1973 redistricting ordered by the California Supreme Court renumbered it the 26th. Rousselot was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1982 after a partisan redistricting divided his old congressional district, leading him to run in the 30th District represented by Democrat Matthew Martinez, who won the general election by 54% to 46%.
Rousselot served as special assistant to President Ronald Reagan in 1983, and as president of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a lobbying group, from 1985 to 1988. He was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination to the One Hundred Third Congress in 1992 in the newly redrawn 25th Congressional District, which ultimately was won by Republican Howard McKeon.
Rousselot died of heart failure in Irvine, California, in 2003.

[[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroanatomy, Cerebrum, Central nervous system, Neuropsychology

   [[File:Prefrontal1.png|thumbnail|right|An illustration of brain's prefrontal region]]
The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC or DL-PFC) is an area in the prefrontal cortex of the brain of humans and primates. It is one of the most recently evolved parts of the human brain, that undergoes an extremely prolonged period of maturation that lasts until adulthood.[tpl]cite book|last=Luciana|first=ed. by Charles A. Nelson; Monica|title=Handbook of developmental cognitive neuroscience|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. u.a.|isbn=0-262-14073-X[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] DLPFC is not an anatomical structure, but rather a functional one. This region lays in the middle frontal gyrus of humans (i.e., lateral part of Brodmann's area (BA) 9 and 46 Brodmann, 1909 and in macaque monkeys, this region is around the principal sulcus (i.e., in Walker's area 46 Walker, 1940).[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neures.2005.10.013 |title= |year=2001 |last1=Hoshi |first1=E. |journal=Neuroscience Research |volume= |issue= |pages= |pmid=16310877[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.061 |title= |year=2013 |last1=Mylius |first1=V. |journal=NeuroImage |volume= |issue= |pages= |pmid=23567888[/tpl] Other sources consider that DLPFC is attributed anatomically to BA 9 and 46 [tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhs256 |title= |year=2013 |last1=Cieslik |first1=E. |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume= |issue= |pages= |pmid=[/tpl] and BA 8, 9 and 10.  

DLPFC is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, and to a variety of brain areas, which include the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (specifically, the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex, including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas.[tpl]cite web|last=Moss|first=Simmon|title=Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex|url=http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=191|publisher=Psychlopedia|accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl] Also, DLPFC is the end point for the dorsal pathway (stream) that tells the brain how to interact with the stimuli. On the other hand, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (located more inferior/ventral to DLPFC) is the end point of the ventral pathway (stream) that brings information about the stimuli’s characteristics.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5652-12.2013 |title=Disruption of Dorsolateral but Not Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Improves Unconscious Perceptual Memories |year=2013 |last1=Lee |first1=T.

An important function of the DLPFC is the executive functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract
reasoning. However, DLPFC is not exclusively responsible for the executive functions. All complex mental activity requires the additional cortical and subcortical circuits with which the DLPFC is connected.[tpl]cite book | title=School neuropsychology: A Practitioner's Handbook | publisher=Guilford Press | author=James B. Hale, Catherine A. Fiorello | year=2004 | pages=64-65 | isbn=1593850115[/tpl] The DLPFC is also the highest cortical area that is involved in motor planning, organization and regulation.

CATEGORIES: British bomber aircraft 1910–1919, Avro aircraft, Single-engined tractor aircraft, Biplanes

The Avro 519 was a British bomber aircraft of the First World War, a development of the Avro 510 seaplane. They were two-bay biplanes of conventional configuration with greatly uneven span. Two single-seat examples, powered by a single 150 hp (110 kW) Sunbeam water-cooled engine, were ordered by the RNAS in early 1916. This was followed soon by orders for two modified aircraft for the Royal Flying Corps. These were fitted with seats for a crew of two and had more powerful (225 hp/168 kW) Sunbeam engines 
The first of the two-seaters was designated 519A to reflect its modifications. The second two-seater, however, was so different that it received a completely new number from Avro - 522 - and featured new wings with both upper and lower wings of equal, greater span, in the hope that this would rectify the type's poor climbing performance.
Never used operationally, all four were used for flight testing with the last still in service in April 1917.
There are some indications that the Avro 522A formed part of the equipment of 2 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1920's.

[[Roll over protection structure]]
CATEGORIES: Automotive technology tradenames, Automotive safety technologies, Tractors, Agricultural machinery

Roll Over Protection Structure (ROPS) refers to operator compartment structures (usually cabs or frames) intended to protect equipment operators and motorists from injuries caused by vehicle overturns or rollovers.
Commonly found on heavy equipment (i.e. tractors), earthmoving machinery and UTVs used in construction, agriculture and mining, ROPS structures are defined by various regulatory agencies, including the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).See OSHA Roll-Over Protective Structures, Direct Final Rule. The regulations include both a strength requirement as well as an energy absorption requirement of the structure. Some dump trucks add a protrusion to their boxes that cover the operators compartment for ROPS purposes.
ROPS are commonly fitted to  4x4's, pickup trucks and  utes used in the mining industry. Products such as this were developed out of necessity so employees travelling around or within mine sites were provided with extra protection in the event of a fleet vehicle roll over. [tpl]cite web|url=http://minecorp.com.au/history-rops|title=History of ROPS|publisher=Minecorp[/tpl]
In the US, ROPS designs have to be certified by a Professional Engineer, who will normally require a destructive test. The structure will be tested at a reduced temperature (where the metal is more brittle), or fabricated from materials that have satisfactory low temperature performance.[tpl]fact|date=August 2013[/tpl]
In Australia and most other countries, International Organization for Standardization has guidelines for destructively testing ROPS structures on earthmoving machinery, excavators, forestry equipment and tractors. Theoretical performance analysis of major new design ROPS is not permitted as an alternative to physical testing.[tpl]fact|date=August 2013[/tpl]

This was confirmed later when animal testing found it to cause benign and malignant tumors in the mammary glands, stomachs, esophagi, and lungs of rodents of both sexes, although insufficient evidence exists in human exposure.
This successful use of bacterial mutagenicity as a screen for carcinogenicity confirmed the use of this methodology as a rapid and efficient test, in comparison to animal testing alone, and led to its further development. The availability of such simpler tests in turn gave rise to greater government oversight and testing of compounds to which the public would be exposed.

Gila Sher is a professor of philosophy at the University of California, San Diego. She has worked extensively in the theory of truth and philosophy of logic. Sher is a leading advocate of foundational holism, a holistic theory of epistemology.
Sher earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia University, where she studied the works of Willard Quine and Alfred Tarski.  Her dissertation was directed by Charles Parsons. Her early work focused on Tarski's definition of truth. Her reformulation of this definition has been influential in modern truth theory. Her dissertation was expanded into the book The Bounds of Logic (1991),Sher, Gila. (1991), The Bounds of Logic, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. in which Sher also formalized definitions for unique second-order quantifiers such as 'most'.
Sher has pursued research into logical positivism and logical foundationalism. She has argued that strict-ordering Foundationalism, in the vein of Rudolf Carnap, is untenable, supporting Quine's argument from Two Dogmas of Empiricism. She has, however, resisted the mainstream move toward all-or-nothing and semantic holism. The former view she considers unexplanatory, and the latter she considers untenable (see: Jerry Fodor).Sher, Gila. (2004), In Search of a Substantive Theory of Truth, The Journal of Philosophy 
Sher has also written more generally on the metaphysics of truth. She put forward an influential criticism of John Etchemendy in the article "Did Tarski Commit Tarski's Fallacy?"Sher, Gila. (1996), Did Tarski Commit Tarski's Fallacy?, The Journal of Symbolic Logic 61, 653-86. This article was influential in defending Tarskian truth theory from the radical attack posed by Etchemendy. She is also a leading Quine scholar, writing about the place of philosophy in his theory of naturalized epistemology.Sher, Gila. (1999), Is There a Place for Philosophy in Quine's Theory?, The Journal of Philosophy 96, 491-524.
Since 2012, she is one of four editors-in-chief of the journal Synthese.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.springer.com/philosophy/epistemology+and+philosophy+of+science/journal/11229|title=Synthese[/tpl]

He earned the International Master title in 1976 by winning the World Junior Championship at Groningen, ahead of such noted players as Ľubomír Ftáčnik and Oleg Romanishin. It was the first time an American had won the World Junior since William Lombardy in 1957. Other achievements included being Louisiana State Champion in 1986, 1987 and 1988. 
His father, Carl Diesen, was a tournament chess player as early as the mid-1940s, which resulted in strong family support for Mark's chess career.  He grew up in Potomac, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., which afforded him numerous opportunities to play.  It also allowed Mark to become a student of Grandmaster Lubosh Kavalek, who was one of the strongest players in the world.  While Kavalek was noted as a tactician, Diesen was a player with a positional style that made him a  difficult opponent to face for even the most experienced IMs and GMs.  Among the top players he defeated in his short career were Larry Evans, Borislav Ivkov, John Nunn, and Eugenio Torre. Diesen played in the 1980 U.S. Championship – his only appearance in the Closed Championship – but had to withdraw after three rounds after injuring himself in a fall.
A graduate of the University of Tennessee, he had a degree in Chemical Engineering. After dropping out of chess, he worked as a reservoir engineer for Shell Oil, Pennzoil and Noble Energy. After his withdraw from chess he continued to influence and inspire through IM with Mark Diesen and coaching within the Conroe-Houston area.
Diesen was married with three daughters (Gina, Amy, and Sarah).

Double Peak is a popular hiking and biking area due to its many trails and convenient access points. On the north side, the mountain can be accessed by hikers and bikers through Discovery Lake Park, but this trailhead is closed to motorized vehicles. On the south side, the mountain can be accessed by vehicles through Double Peak Drive, extending from the neighborhood of San Elijo Hills. Both the North and the South access trails offer wide, partially paved surfaces. There is also a less-accessible rock and dirt trail which allows summiting the mountain from the East side. The Eastern trail has a steep incline, with rugged, staircase-like rock extrusions and at some points, loosely packed shale. The Eastern trail can only be accessed by following other trails along either the north or south face of the mountain, around to the eastern face of the mountain.
Accessing the mountain from the north side, at Discovery Lake Park, a City of San Marcos information sign states that the length of the trail is [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the park to the summit.
On a clear day, the peak offers views of distant places such as Mexico, Downtown San Diego, San Clemente Island, Catalina Island, the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the Santa Ana Mountains, and the San Bernardino Mountains.

[tpl]Italic title[/tpl][tpl]Distinguish2|the novel The Execution of Justice[/tpl]
Execution of Justice is an ensemble play by Emily Mann chronicling the case of Dan White,[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RDUBjESMxqYC |title=Google Books |accessdate=25 November 2008 |work= |publisher=Samuel French, Inc. |date=1986 [/tpl] who assassinated San Francisco mayor George Moscone and openly gay city supervisor Harvey Milk in November 1978. The play was originally commissioned by the Eureka Theater Company and had an early production by Arena Stage in their 1984/1985 season.
It opened on Broadway on March 13, 1986 with John Spencer playing Dan White and a cast that included Wesley Snipes, Stanley Tucci, Mary McDonnell, and Earle Hyman.[tpl]ibdb title|4399[/tpl] In 1999, the play was adapted for television and was awarded the  Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award for Outstanding TV Movie in 2000.[tpl]cite news|last=Kim|first=Ellen A.|title=2000 GLAAD Media Awards|url=http://www.hollywood.com/feature/2000_GLAAD_Media_Awards/770320|accessdate=31 May 2012|newspaper=Hollywood.com|date=August 22, 2001[/tpl] It is also the winner of the HBO New Plays USA award, the Helen Hayes Award, the Bay Area Critics Circle Award, and it was nominated for a Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Award. 
In the play, the trial itself is on trial in the court of theater and is found guilty of a miscarriage of justice, parallelling the actual case which resulted in White being convicted of a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, rather than two counts of first-degree murder, and sentenced to less than eight years. The play references the urban legend[ref]
</ref><ref>[http://www.snopes.com/legal/twinkie.htm Snopes: The Twinkie Defense]</ref> that White's defense strategy was primarily the so-called "[[Twinkie defense]]" — painting his [[junk food]] consumption as a significant or even in some versions the sole cause of his actions. 
The highly emotional play combines live stage action, videos, taped voices and music including a video camera on stage projecting its image onto large screens throughout the performance which uses the drag nun Sister Boom Boom, an AIDS activist, (played in the original production by Wesley Snipes) as a voice of consciousness representing human rights for all marginalized groups, not just gays.

"The People" is a song by American rapper Common, released as the lead single of his seventh studio album Finding Forever. It made its first appearance on Kanye West's Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape. The song features production by West and contains background vocals provided by soul singer Dwele. The original version of the song had Common singing the hook by himself, but this was later replaced with Dwele singing the hook. It contains samples of "We Almost Lost Detroit" by Gil Scott-Heron as well as vocal samples of "Long Red" by Mountain (the latter of which was sampled on Wouldn't Get Far featuring West). This action was part of West's intention to pay tribute to J Dilla through the production style expressed within the album.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2007/04/26/track-by-track-commons-finding-forever | title =  Track by Track: Common's Finding Forever from Fader Magazine | format =  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = June 11, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Rodriguez | first = Jayson | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1556781/20070410/common.jhtml | title = Kanye West, Lily Allen Finding Something In Common | work =MTV | publisher =MTV Networks |date=2007-04-11 | accessdate = June 13, 2007[/tpl]

"Watch the Flowers Grow" is a song composed by L. Russell Brown and Raymond Bloodworth and popularized by The Four Seasons in 1967. The single was released in the wake of The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and The Beatles' Sgt.

Songwriter L. Russell Brown would compose (or co-compose) a string of hit records in the 1970s, including several recorded by Dawn featuring Tony Orlando.

Ognjen Cvitan (born 10 October 1961 in Šibenik, Yugoslavia) is a Croatian (formerly Yugoslav) chess grandmaster.  Cvitan earned the International Master title by winning the 1981 World Junior Championship. His grandmaster title was awarded in 1987.
He has represented both Yugoslavia and Croatia in international team events. Making his debut for Yugoslavia's C team at the Novi Sad 1990 Chess Olympiad, he recorded a plus score on board one. At the Manila Olympiad of 1992, he played second reserve board for Croatia and earned an individual gold medal. He took part in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2002, but was knocked out in the first round by Alexander Lastin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/a1a2$wix.htm|title=World Chess Championship  2001-02 FIDE Knockout Matches|publisher=Mark-Weeks.com|accessdate=13 April 2011[/tpl]
For most of his career, Cvitan has been an extremely active tournament player, earning himself a reasonably high Elo rating, yet never quite being able to break into the 'elite' circuit. In other strong grandmaster events, he competed with a great deal of success and accumulated a succession of first places, either outright or shared. In the late 1980s, these included Wolfsberg 1986, Prague 1987, Pula 1987 and 1988, Mendrisio 1987, 1988 and 1989, San Bernardino 1987, Belgrade 1987, Geneva 1988, Bela Crkva 1988, Oberwart 1988, Chiasso 1989, and Vrsac 1989. The 1990s were almost as fruitful for him, his first place tally including Cannes 1990 and 1996, Dubrovnik 1990, Bad Ragaz 1992, Forli 1993, Basel 1999 and Zurich 1999. Even into the new millennium, he has registered victories at Zadar 2001, Oberwart 2001, Rijeka 2001 and Bizovac 2002.
In 2011, he was awarded the title of FIDE Trainer.

[[Kalamatianó]]
CATEGORIES: Greek dances, Greek music, Greek words and phrases

Kalamatianó ([tpl]lang-el|καλαματιανό[/tpl]) is a type of Greek folk music associated with a dance sharing its name. Originating in the southern Greek port city of Kalamata, its most recognizable feature is its asymmetrical time signature of 7/8 time, meaning that there are seven beats per measure, generally subdivided into two groups of 3 and 4 beats respectively. 
Although this rhythmic structure is unfamiliar to westerners, it is thoroughly at home in Greece, Cyprus and the surrounding countries. The kalamatiano is a traditional line dance admitting of varying speeds. Probably the best known folk song in this genre is Mandili Kalamatiano (Μαντήλι Καλαματιανό). 
An especially haunting example of the kalamatiano, Mekapses Yitonisa (Μ'έκαψες γειτόνισσα), was recorded for the National Geographic Society's groundbreaking Music of Greece album, released in 1968. The American jazz composer, Dave Brubeck, well known for his exploration of asymmetrical rhythms in his own music, used a variant of the rhythm of the kalamatiano for his Unsquare Dance, though the measure was divided into 4 followed by 3 beats rather than 3 followed by 4.

[tpl]Refimprove|date=June 2007[/tpl]Nuno Oliveira (1925–1989) is widely acknowledged as a master of the art of dressage. His teachings have inspired riders and trainers all over the world to adopt the 'baroque' or 'classical' style of working with the horse; an art which goes back hundreds of years and encompasses the fundamentals which most 'modern' disciplines can be traced back to.
Nuno was born in Lisbon on June 23, 1925. He studied riding under Joaquim Goncalves de Miranda, in the style of the riding academy of Versailles. A great teacher, he possessed a near-encyclopedic knowledge of equestrian theory that crossed many styles and countries. His principal influences were François Robichon de La Guérinière, Gustav Steinbrecht and François Baucher. 
On February 2, 1989 he was discovered dead in his bed in a hotel in Australia. It is said that music by Verdi was playing in the room, music which he often played or sang while riding.

CATEGORIES: Perninae, Aviceda, Birds of Cameroon

The African Cuckoo-Hawk (Aviceda cuculoides) is a medium-sized raptor in the family Accipitridae resembling a Common Cuckoo, found in sub-Saharan Africa and along the eastern parts of Southern Africa. It prefers dense woodland and forest of either indigenous or exotic trees.
It is a mostly solitary and skulking bird, flying between trees in short glides with wings held high, swooping up at end of glide and perching. It is usually found hunting in grass and low vegetation, remaining still for a while and then moving to a new spot. Its diet consists mainly of insects, with a preference for grasshoppers, but also takes small snakes and lizards, as well as birds and rodents.
Nesting takes place from September to February, and consists of a platform of leafy twigs, constructed by both sexes in the upper foliage of a tall tree and located from 10–25 m above ground, lofty eucalypts often being favoured. The clutch is of 2 (rarely 3) chalky-white eggs with reddish-brown blotches. Incubation is by both sexes or female only and lasts for 32–33 days. The nestlings 
are nest-bound for about a month and are fed by both parents.

[[Bishops' Selection Conference]]
CATEGORIES: Church of Ireland

In the Church of Ireland, the Bishops' Selection Conference is an annual panel of church members, representing both clergy and laity, who assess candidates offering themselves for consideration for training for the ordained ministry.
The Selection Panel is composed of a Bishop, a Priest, two members of the laity, and a representative of the Church of Ireland Theological College. 
Candidates can be men or women from any of the dioceses in the Church of Ireland, seeking either to enter stipendiary ministry or non-stipendary ministry (NSM).
Prospective candidates generally must be a member of their diocese's Fellowship of Vocation for at least one year before their Bishop will consider putting them forward for the Selection Conference, who does so on the recommendation of their Diocesan Director of Ordinands (DDO) and after satisfactory performance at psychological and academic testing at a Pre-Selection Conference, usually held in January.
Interview questions are tailored for each candidate but follow general themes: spirituality, understanding of vocation, vision and leadership, etc.
After interviewing each candidate, the Selection Panel can make one of four recommendations to his or her Bishop: 
1. Recommended for training

2. Conditional recommendation for training

3. Not recommended for training

4. Defer the decision until the following year
The Bishops are not bound by the recommendations of the Selection Conference.
Candidates recommended for training may commence theological study within three years of their acceptance. Candidates not recommended for training generally must wait for two years before re-applying (in which case the new Selection Panel is not informed of their previous application).
The current Chairman of the Selection Conference is the Right Reverend Ken Clarke (Bishop of Kilmore), and its Secretary is Karen Seaman.

Paul Jules Tillaux (December 8, 1834 – 1904) was a French physician who was a native of Aunay-sur-Odon, département Calvados.
Tillaux was a surgeon and professor of surgery in Paris, and in 1879 became a member of the Académie de Médecine.  He was director of the Amphitheatre d'Anatomie des Hopitaux de Paris from 1868 to 1890.
In 1892 Tillaux was the first physician to describe an uncommon Salter Harris Type III fracture of the tibia. He performed experiments on cadavers and discovered that stress to the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament could lead to this type of avulsion fracture. This fracture is unique because it occurs during a certain period of adolescence, when there is a differential rate of growth of the epiphysis. In honor of his discovery, this condition is now called "Tillaux' fracture". Tillaux' fracture is sometimes misdiagnosed as a simple sprain.

Moose Lake is a relatively small lake in North-eastern Alberta, Canada, which drains north into the Beaver River (Canada).  It is located just a few kilometres west of the town of Bonnyville. Despite dense green and blue-green algae blooms in summer, the lake is a popular recreational area for local residents.Atlas of Alberta Lakes. Moose Lake
 
 

Moose Lake in Alberta

It is unclear whether the name (translated from the [tpl]Lang-fr|Lac d'Orignal[/tpl]) was given because of the large moose population of the area or because the shape of the lake resembles a moose's head - Franchere Bay and Vezeau Bay being the antlers, Bonnyville Beach the chin, and Island Bay the nose (complete with a large island for a nostril).
Around 1768 William Pink passed the mouth of the Mooselake River. In 1789 Angus Shaw of the North West Company built a post on the northwest shore of the lake called Fort Lac L'Orignal or Shaw House. It was on the northwest side on a large point southeast of the lake's outlet. The river was so shallow that canoes were taken up the river empty and goods portaged overland. It was in good beaver country and within easy reach of Fort George 35 miles to the south on the North Saskatchewan. Buffalo pemmican was carried north to the lake and then via the Beaver River to Lac Île-à-la-Crosse to feed the voyageurs on their long journey to Lake Athabasca. In the 1792-93 season Moose Lake produced 64 of the 392 total packs of beaver produced by the Churchill River Department. In 1798 David Thompson (explorer) reached the lake from Fort George.

A critical success but commercial failure at the time, no further episodes were commissioned beyond the initial eight but following the success of Ocelot's Kirikou and the Sorceress six were edited into the 2000 compilation movie Princes et princesses (Princes and Princesses), in which form they finally saw wide exposure and acclaim both in France and internationally; a further episode was included in a home release of short works in 2008 but one remains unavailable for public consumption.
It is the first of Ocelot's projects to be filmed entirely in silhouette, an aesthetic he since become particularly associated with, continuing in it and the "actor" conceit with 1992's Les Contes de la nuit and conceiving Kirikou and the Sorceress as such, returning to it fully with the continuation of Ciné si he had always planned for in the form of Dragons et princesses.

Farm to Market Road 525, or FM 525 or Urban Road 525, is a state highway entirely inside the city of Houston, Texas, United States.  The road is known locally as Aldine-Bender Road.
FM 525 was established in 1945 as a route between the unincorporated areas of Aldine and Bender before Beltway 8 was established.  Both areas are now inside the Houston city limits.
In 1995 the state officially retired FM 525 in favor of Urban Road 525, but the term is not used by the public, and in fact, the road is rarely referred to as a state highway.[tpl]Or|date=June 2011[/tpl]

[[John Anderson (carpenter)]]
CATEGORIES: 1759 births, 1832 deaths, British carpenters, People from Ayrshire, 18th-century Scottish people, 19th-century Scottish people

John Anderson (born 1759, Ayrshire – May 4, 1832, Invergarry) was a Scottish carpenter by trade. He was a close friend of Robert Burns and is reputed to have built his coffin in 1796. He is also the subject of a famous poem by Burns, later set to music called "John Anderson My Jo, John."
He is buried in Kilchuimen Burial Ground, Fort Augustus with a Scottish Heritage plaque. It mentions that his son in law was killed in the wreck of an early British passenger steamship, PS Comet II, near Gourock in 1825.
The heritage plaque reads:
"John Anderson. My Jo.
Friend of Robert Burns
Character of one of the most touching of Burns Songs. Gifted by the family of the late Norman Watters
Past President of Bowhill People's Burns Club"
The stone reads:
"Sacred to the memory of
John Anderson who died at Invergarry
the 4 May 1832 Aged 84 years
also his daughter Catherine who died at Invergarry the 20 December 1832 aged 52 years
Relict of the late
James Grearson who was lost in the "Comet" off Gourack Point the 20 Oct 1825
This stone is erected by their affectionate children."
Despite the claim recorded in the heritage plaque above,  Burns' poem is based on an earlier poem of the same title and metre:
John Anderson, my jo, John
I wonder what you mean
To lie sae lang in the morning
And sit sae late at e'en ...................
The earlier version was extant c.1744,  and is a mildly bawdy ballad in which the wife berates John for his waning performance in bed,  recalls his former ardour,  and threatens him with the cuckold's horns if he doesn't deliver:
........... But 'tis a mickle finer thing
To see your hurdies fyke
To see your hurdies fyke, John
And hit the rising blow
'Tis then I like your chanter pipe
John Anderson, my jo.
The editors of the Canongate Burns (2001) offer no explanation for Burns's adaptation of the old song of six stanzas into a two verse celebration of love into old age (Burns himself died at the age of 37).

The largest and most ambitious ironclad program of the war, the project was dogged by delays caused by bureaucratic meddling. Twenty ships of the class were eventually built at great expense, but proved so unseaworthy when trialed that they were quickly sidelined, causing a public scandal.

CATEGORIES: Ennomini

The Ennomini are a tribe of geometer moths  in  the Ennominae subfamily. They are large-bodied and rather nondescript Ennominae, overall showing many similarities to the closely related Azelinini and Nacophorini.Young (2008)
Most have a beige to brown color, and they rarely possess the disruptive cryptic patterns seen in many other geometer moths. A typical ennomiine wing pattern consists of two or three costal to dorsal sections, one of which is often darker in color. There is rarely more than one conspicuous dark or light spot on each side of each wing, and many do not have any particularly prominent markings at all.

The Battle of Maniaki was fought on June 1, 1825 in Maniaki, Greece (in the hills east of Gargalianoi) between Egyptian forces led by Ibrahim Pasha and Greek forces led by Papaflessas.Finlay, p. 75. "He quitted Nauplia with great parade, attended by a body of veteran soldiers; and when he reached the village of Maniaki, in the hills to the east of Gargaliano, his force exceeded three thousand men. The bold priest possessed no military quality but courage. He posted his troops in an ill-selected position and awaited the attack of Ibrahim, who advances in person to carry the position at the head of six thousand men on 1 June. Many of the archimandrite's troops, seeing the superior force of the Egyptians, deserted during the night, and only about fifteen hundred men remained. The pasha's regulars were led on to storm the Greek intrenchments in gallant style, and a short and desperate struggle ensued. The Greeks were forced from their position before they fled. The affair was the best contested during the war, for a thousand Greeks perished by the Arab bayonets, and four hundred Arabs lay dead on the field. In spite of the defeat and the severe loss sustained by the Greeks, they gained honour and courage by the battle of Maniaki."

The Naked Eye ([tpl]lang-es|La Mirada del Otro[/tpl]) is a 1998 Spanish film, written and directed by Vicente Aranda adapted from a novel by Fernando G. Delgado. It stars Laura Morante, Miguel Ángel García and José Coronado. The film is an erotic psychodrama, an exploration of female sexual desire. It premiered at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival in 1998 where it was nominated for the Golden Bear.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1998/02_programm_1998/02_Programm_1998.html |title=Berlinale: 1998 Programme |accessdate=2012-01-21 |work=berlinale.de[/tpl]
Aranda objects to labelisation of his film as an "erotic film", instead he defines it as "psycho-erotic": "heroine, Begoña's ambition is transparency. (...) She wants to enjoy life in its widest expression, and looks for clarity through sex."[tpl]cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Wettbewerb/In Competition | journal = Moving Pictures, Berlinale Extra | volume = | issue = | pages = p.30 | publisher = | location = Berlin | date = 11–22 February 1998 | url = | format = | issn = | accessdate = [/tpl]

The Ourapterygini are one of the large tribes of geometer moths in the Ennominae subfamily. They are particularly plentiful in the Neotropics. Ourapterygini are generally held to be the youngest tribe of their subfamily, and at least seasonally have characteristic apomorphic asymmetrical processes of the anellus.Young (2008)
Many members of this tribe are remarkably butterfly-like. The tribe contains more partially diurnal species than usual for geometer moths, and many do not have the cryptic coloration typical for the family. There is a tendency to light yellowish hues and either little or a quite bold pattern, making some species rather conspicuous. It is known that at least some are noxious to predators, and such coloration might be aposematic.

"You Played Yourself" is a 1990 rap single by Ice-T, from his third album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say.
The song tells the story of a would-be rapper who goes uneducated thinking he is a gangster when really he is nothing. He offends his fans because he thinks he is above them but they turn on him - he is left unemployed with no one because he has offended them all. He becomes a drug addict, he is paranoid and doesn't eat. He rips off his family for drug money and they disown him. He then tries to do an armed robbery to get money but accidentally kills someone and ends up on death row.  The track heavily samples "The Boss" by James Brown from the Black Caesar (film) soundtrack.

The 1884–85 British Home Championship was the second football tournament between the Home Nations and was, like the previous competition, won by a Scottish team which completely dominated proceedings. The English also performed well, beginning with a strong victory over Ireland but failing to capitalise on this start with 1–1 draws with Wales and Scotland. The Welsh thrashed Ireland 8–1 but were well beaten 8–2 by the Scots who won their final game in a similar scoreline against the Irish, who finished last having conceded 20 goals in three games. The Scots, who had scored 16 goals two games, would win (individually or shared) six of the first seven tournament.

[[Growth hormone releasing hexapeptide]]

CATEGORIES: Peptides

Growth hormone releasing hexapeptide (GHRP6) is one of several synthetic met-enkephalin analogs that include unnatural D-amino acids, were developed for their growth hormone (GH) releasing activity and are called GH secretagogues.  They lack opioid activity but are potent stimulators of GH release.  These secretagogues are distinct from growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) in that they share no sequence relation and derive their function through action at a completely different receptor.  This receptor was originally called the GH secretagogue receptor, but due to subsequent discoveries, the hormone ghrelin is now considered the receptor's natural endogenous ligand. Therefore, these GH secretagogues act as synthetic ghrelin mimetics.

Ferguson's Gang, formed in 1927, was an anonymous and somewhat enigmatic group that raised funds for the National Trust during the period from 1930 until 1947.
The inner-circle of the group were five young women,[tpl]cite book|last=Hutton-North|first=Anna|title=Ferguson's Gang - The Maidens behind the Masks|year=2013|publisher=Lulu Inc|isbn=978-1-291-48453-3[/tpl] who hid their identities behind masks, unusual pseudonyms, and mock-Cockney communiques.[tpl]cite news | first = Sue | last = Herdman | title = The Cloaked Crusaders | work = The National Trust Magazine | date = Spring 2008 | pages = 24–27 | publisher = The National Trust[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Waterson |first=Merlin |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The National Trust: The First Hundred Years |year=1994 |publisher=National Trust (Enterprises) Ltd, BCA and BBC Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-37066-6[/tpl]
The gang was influenced by Clough Williams-Ellis's publication England and the Octopus, which denounced insensitive building and ugly development. They determined to save what they could. Their donations enabled the purchase of Shalford Mill, in Surrey, and Newtown Old Town Hall, on the Isle of Wight. They also funded the purchase of stretches of the coastline of Cornwall, Priory Cottages at Steventon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), and supported appeals for money to purchase land in Derbyshire, the Lake District, Devon and Wiltshire. In total they raised the sum of £4,500, the equivalent to half a million pounds in today's money.
As an example of their methods, in 1933 a fully masked Red Biddy deposited a large sack of Victorian coins to the value of £100 on the Trust secretary's desk. In 1935, one of the 'gang' was interviewed by the BBC, and turned up at Broadcasting House wearing a mask.
In the words of the group's leader Bill Stickers:http://fergusonsgang.co.uk/introducing-the-gang.html

Members of Ferguson's Gang included Bill Stickers, Sister Agatha, Red Biddy, Erb the Smasher, Kate O'Brien The Nark, Silent O'Moyle, See Mee Run, Gerry Moham, Black Maria, and the Lord Beershop of the Gladstone Islands & Mercator's Projection. When the Oxbridge Sanskrit scholar and adopted Cornish bard Margaret Steuart Pollard died at the age of 93 in 1996, her obituaries revealed that she had been Bill Stickers.[tpl]cite news | first = Ann Trevenen | last = Jenkin | title = Obituary: Margaret Pollard |  date = 1996-12-07 | work = The Independent (London) | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituarymargaret-pollard-1313345.html[/tpl]
In 2013 the author Anna Hutton-North completed an extensive research programme to uncover the women behind the pseudonyms.

The road was established in 1941 as a spur from U.S. Highway 90, then the main route east from Houston, to the Market Street Road.  In 1961, the road was shortened to State Highway 73, which later became Interstate 10. In 1995, the state of Texas re-designated the road as Urban Road 526, but like FM 525 to the northwest, people rarely refer to the road as a state highway.

[[Hitler's Children]]
CATEGORIES: Red Army Faction, 1977 books, J. B. Lippincott & Co. books

Hitler's Children: The Story of the Baader-Meinhof Terrorist Gang is a 1977 book about the West German militant left-wing group, the Red Army Faction (also known as The Baader-Meinhof Gang), by the British author Jillian Becker. Note that neither the 1943 or 2012 films were on this subject.
The first edition was published in June 1977 by J. B. Lippincott & Co. It recounts the deeds of the group up to the suicides of Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader. A second expanded edition was published in January 1978 as a Panther paperback by Granada, London, in which an additional chapter recorded additional terrorist attacks by a "new generation" of young German terrorists carried out in 1977. The revised text was translated into several European languages and Japanese. It was also serialized in leading daily newspapers in London, Tokyo and Oslo. A third edition was published by Pickwick Books, London, in 1989, with additional material. 
The book chronicles the group and provides a brief biography of the main members, Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, and also describes Ulrike Meinhof's life leading up to her terrorist career. Elsewhere in the book the author refers to Ulrike Meinhof's "characteristic inefficiency" and fellow member Siegfried Hausner's persistent bungling as an urban guerilla.

[[Shoulder-in]]

CATEGORIES: Riding techniques and movements

The shoulder-in is a lateral movement in dressage used to supple and balance the horse and encourage use of its hindquarters. It is performed on three tracks, where the horse is bent around the rider's inside leg so that the horse's inside hind leg and outside foreleg travel on the same line. For some authors it is a "key lesson" of dressage, performed on a daily basis.Cf. Loriston-Clarke, p. 84. - Also: "The shoulder-in is a key lesson of advanced dressage training because many features of the correctly ridden horse are represented in this movement.", translated from the German Richtlinien, p. 50.

[[Danville, Quebec]]
CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in Quebec, Incorporated places in Estrie

Danville is a city in the administrative region of Estrie, in the Canadian province of Quebec. As of the 2011 Canadian Census, the population was 4,070. 
Danville is on a stretch of the Chemin Craig, a road built in the 19th century connecting Quebec to New England. The town is about [tpl]convert|70|mi|km[/tpl] north of the Vermont border. American loyalists from New England began arriving in 1783 and gave the town its name in memory of their hometown in Virginia of the same name: Danville, Virginia.
Until 1976, the population of Danville was two-thirds Anglo-Protestant. This proportion was reversed during the mid-1970s when part of the younger generation migrated to English Canada or to Montreal.
The city has many heritage buildings, including three Protestant churches (Adventist, Anglican and United), a Baptist evangelical church and a Roman Catholic church.
Danville has two primary schools: a French language school, École Masson; and an English-speaking school known as ADS (Asbestos-Shipton-Danville).
At the centre of the city is a square formed by the enlargement of an intersection.  A memorial for soldiers killed in the First World War and Second World War stands in the centre of this square. Another memorial, to Private Timothy O'Hea, is erected in front of the former City Hall.
Once a busy town inhabited by workers of the nearby Johns Manville asbestos mine, the town has quieted down considerably since the mine's closing. A magnesium smelter called Magnola, part of Noranda (using mine tailings from local asbestos mine) set up a facility in the town not long ago, but ended up closing it due to increasing foreign competition. Rolling fields in the area make for good farming, many farms having been around for over a century. Both dairy and beef cattle are raised in the area, although other livestock is common.
Each year the town has an art symposium, where artists from the area gather in the towns many churches, to display their artwork.

Google Street View is a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth that provides panoramic views from positions along many streets in the world. It was launched on May 25, 2007, in several cities in the United States, and has since expanded to include cities and rural areas worldwide.
Where available, Street View images appear after zooming in beyond the highest zooming level in maps and satellite images, and also by dragging a "pegman" icon onto a location on a map. When dragging the pegman icon, blue lines on the map showing Street View imagery will appear. Using the keyboard or mouse, the horizontal and vertical viewing direction and zoom level can be selected. A solid or broken line in the photo shows the approximate path followed by the camera car, and arrows link to the next photo in each direction. At junctions and crossings of camera car routes, more arrows are shown. By using Google Maps, users can turn on stereoscopic 3D mode by right-clicking in Street View to get an anaglyph version of any Street View images. However, this mode requires users to wear red/cyan glasses to see the 3D effects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.itechdiary.com/google-maps-street-view-now-there-is-3d-option.html |title=Google Maps Street View, now there is 3D option? |publisher=Itechdiary.com |accessdate=August 27, 2010[/tpl]
On November 21, 2008, Street View was added to the Maps application installed on the Apple iPhone. On December 10, 2008, Street View was added to the Maps application for S60 3rd Edition. Street View has now also been added to the BlackBerry and Windows Mobile versions of Google Maps.

Breach and Clear is a tactical name for a common room clearing method. It is used when capturing a room or area with guards, enemies, or hostile civilians near the entrances to the area. An explosive charge such as C4 or another similar device is placed over the door / entrance, then detonated. This allows free movement inside a heavily guarded area, as mostly all conventional locks would be incinerated by the explosion.
Breach and Clear can also be executed by opening a door first, then throwing an explosive similar to a grenade inside. This can be performed with a smoke grenade or a flashbang in order to incapacitate the enemy. This is often called Smoke & Clear, Frag & Clear, or Flash & Clear.

The 1898 municipal election was held December 12, 1898.  In previous elections, an entire town council had been elected at once for a one year term; 1898 marked the beginning of staggered aldermanic terms, such that half of the six aldermen would be elected each year to two year terms.  The mayor continued to be elected annually.
Because in the previous election all six aldermen had been elected to a one year term, it was still necessary to elect six aldermen.  However, in order to set up the staggered terms, three were to be elected to one year terms and three to two year terms.
In addition to the city council, five public school trustees and four private school trustees were elected.

[[All or Nothing at All]]

CATEGORIES: Songs with music by Arthur Altman, Songs with lyrics by Jack Lawrence, Frank Sinatra songs, 1939 songs

"All or Nothing at All" is a song composed in 1939 by Arthur Altman, with lyrics by Jack Lawrence. 
Frank Sinatra's 1939 recording of the song became a huge hit in 1943, when it was reissued by Columbia Records during the 1942-43 musicians' strike. The record peaked in the Billboard top two.
In a 1944 interview, Sinatra said of the delayed success of the song, "That was the song, a few days after Harry James and myself recorded it, that gave us our walking papers out of the old Victor Hugo Cafe (a major entertainment venue of the 1930s) on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood. The manager came up and waved his hands for us to stop. He said Harry's trumpet playing was too loud for the joint and my singing was just plain lousy and fired Harry, me and the entire band on the spot. He said the two of us couldn't draw flies as an attraction, and I guess he was right - the room was as empty as a barn. It's a funny thing about that song. The recording we made of it 5 years ago is now one of the top spots among the best sellers. But it's the same old recording. It's also the song I auditioned with for Tommy Dorsey, who signed me on the strength of it. And now it's my first big record."

The 1899 municipal election was held December 11, 1899.  It was the first municipal election in which only a portion of the aldermen were to be elected; in 1898, three of the six aldermen elected were elected to two year terms in preparation for a system in which only half of the aldermen would be up for election each year.  Kenneth McLeod, Alfred Jackson, and Kenneth W. MacKenzie were all only halfway through their two year terms at the time of the election.  However, MacKenzie resigned in order to become mayor, leaving council with four vacancies.  Only three were filled by the election; council appointed Henry Goodridge to fill the fourth seat until the 1900 election.

CATEGORIES: Blood tests

The pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test is a diagnostic test for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC). MTC is a malignancy of the calcitonin-secreting cells of the thyroid gland, and thus MTC is commonly associated with an elevated calcitonin level, but an elevated level may not always be obvious. The pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test is useful in cases of suspected MTC that are not associated with elevated calcitonin. In these patients, injecting pentagastrin will cause calcitonin levels to rise significantly above the normal or basal range.http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/78/1/114

CATEGORIES: English women painters, Artists from Hawaii, 20th-century English painters, 1972 deaths, 1889 births

Madge Tennent (1889 in Dulwich, London – 1972 in Honolulu) was an English artist. 
Born to Arthur Cook, an architect and landscape painter and his wife, Agnes, a writer.  The family moved in 1894 to Cape Town, South Africa, and Madge’s parents’ efforts to promote tolerance among various races and creeds there no doubt left a lasting impression on the young Madge.Haar, Francis and Neogy, Prithwish, "Artists of Hawaii: Nineteen Painters and Sculptors", University of Hawaii Press, 1974, p. 9Forbes, David W., "Encounters with Paradise: Views of Hawaii and its People, 1778-1941", Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1992, pp. 267
Because of Madge’s artistic promise, her family to give up their home in Cape Town so that she might study in Paris.  There, she studied with William-Adolphe Bouguereau, the leading proponent of academic art.  Eventually finances caused her family to move back to South Africa, where sixteen-year-old Madge led a government-sponsored art school.Haar, Francis and Neogy, Prithwish, "Artists of Hawaii: Nineteen Painters and Sculptors", University of Hawaii Press, 1974, p. 9Forbes, David W., "Encounters with Paradise: Views of Hawaii and its People, 1778-1941", Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1992, pp. 267
Madge was also an accomplished pianist, taught by her mother, and gave regular recitals in Cape Town.  One such recital was attended by a visiting military officer from New Zealand, Hugh Cowper Tennent, who was in South Africa with his regiment.  After their marriage in 1915, the couple moved to New Zealand.  Again Madge directed an art school, having been appointed head instructor at the Government School of Art in Woodville, the village where Madge and Hugh lived while he awaited further military orders.  When orders came, Hugh was posted to France in support of the allied effort in World War I.  Hugh returned from France in 1917 with a badly wounded arm.  An accountant by trade, he was offered a position as treasurer to the government of British Samoa, which he chose to accept.  The Tennents lived in Samoa for six years, during which time Madge was able to indulge a fascination with the native people of Polynesian descent.  Madge was able to devote much of her time to drawing charcoal portraits of Samoans.  In 1923, en route to England to enroll their sons in school, the Tennents stopped over in Honolulu.  It was to have been a brief stop, but they soon were persuaded by members of the local cultural elite, including poet Don Blanding, to stay on.  Madge was immediately taken with the Hawaiian people.  
A renowned art educator as well as painter of modern figurative canvases of Hawaiian subjects, Madge Tennent had a distinguished career based primarily in Hawaii from where she sent paintings to the mainland United States for exhibitions in New York City and Chicago between 1930 and 1939.  She was among the first artists to embrace native Hawaiians as a primary subject matter, whom she depicted as large and robust with audacious, swirling forms and colors.  Two Sisters of Old Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in the collection of the Hawaii State Art Museum is an example of her large paintings of Hawaiian women.  Her influence was increased by her association with the Honolulu Museum of Art in its early days, where she was a frequent lecturer, and where she was included in most of the Academy’s early group shows.  Madge died in Honolulu in 1972.Haar, Francis and Neogy, Prithwish, "Artists of Hawaii: Nineteen Painters and Sculptors", University of Hawaii Press, 1974, p. 9

Edwards, a running back, in his play for the Chargers, had one particularly good year, 1973, wherein the Chargers' offense largely consisted of lobbing screen passes to Edwards, who would rumble down field for much positive yardage.  He is in a sense an obscure folk hero in Chargers lore.

[[Timeline of drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution]]
CATEGORIES: Drafting of the United States Constitution, Ratification of the United States Constitution, United States history timelines

The following is a timeline of the drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution.  The drafting of the Constitution began on  May 25, 1787, when  the Constitutional Convention  met for the first time with a quorum at the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation, and ended on September 17, 1787, the day the Constitution drafted by the convention's delegates to replace the Articles was adopted and signed.  The ratification process for the Constitution began that day, and ended when the final state,  Rhode Island, ratified it on May 29, 1790, three years later.    In addition to key events during the Constitutional Convention and afterward while the Constitution was before the states for their ratification, important events that occurred during the run-up to the convention and during the nation's transition from government under the Articles of Confederation to government under the Constitution are also included, as is the unique ratification vote of  Vermont.  Thus this timeline begins on March 25, 1785, the date when the Mount Vernon Conference , a meeting of delegates from Virginia and Maryland to discuss interstate commercial issues along their mutual water border, convened, and ends on January 10, 1791, when  Vermont, which at the time was a sovereign state, voted to ratify the Constitution and to apply for admission into the Union.

Waterman Steamship Corporation is an American deep sea ocean carrier, specializing in liner services and time charter contracts.  It is owned by International Shipholding Corporation, based in Mobile, Alabama.
Waterman was founded in 1919 in Mobile, Alabama by John Barnett Waterman, T.M. Stevens, W.D. Bellingrath and C.W. Hempstead following their departure from the British owned Elder Dempster Steamship Company.  Waterman and associates started with just one ship, the Eastern Sun leased from the U.S. Shipping Board for service to Liverpool and Manchester.From the Waterman Steamship Corporation records at the University of South Alabama website   
In 1955, McLean Industries, Inc. purchased the stock of Waterman Steamship Corporation from the stockholders.  From its single-ship beginnings, Waterman had amassed a fleet of 125 ships, owned and operated its own shipbuilding and repair yards, owned or controlled three other shipping companies and employed thousands of workers.
The former Waterman Steamship Corporation building on Saint Joseph Street remains a prominent building in the downtown Mobile skyline.  It is now occupied by Wells Fargo Bank.  It opened in 1950 and is famous for its extensive murals in the lobby and a large rotating globe.  The globe can now be seen on display at the Mitchell Center at the University of South Alabama.http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1550

[[Mormon cosmology]]
CATEGORIES: Latter Day Saint doctrines regarding deity, Mormon cosmology

Mormon cosmology is the description of the history, evolution, and destiny of the physical and metaphysical universe according to Mormonism, which includes the doctrines taught by leaders and theologians of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Mormon fundamentalism, the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ and other Brighamite denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement. These views are not generally shared by adherents of other Latter Day Saint movement denominations who do not self-identify as "Mormons", such as the Community of Christ.  Mormon cosmology draws from Biblical cosmology, but has many unique elements provided by Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith, Jr.
According to Mormon cosmology, there was a pre-existence, better described as a pre-mortal life, in which human spirits were literal children of heavenly parents.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|1995[/tpl] ("Each human is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents."); [tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|p=9[/tpl] ("Man, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents, and reared to maturity in the eternal mansions of the Father."). Though their spirits were created, the essential "intelligence" of these spirits is considered eternal, and without beginning. During this pre-existence, two plans were said to have been presented, one championed by Lucifer (Satan) that would have involved loss of moral agency, and another championed by God the Father.  When his plan was not accepted, Lucifer is said to have rebelled and taken "the third part" of the hosts of heaven with him to the earth to serve as tempters.  According to a plan of salvation as described by God the Father, Jehovah (the antemortal Jesus Christ according to Mormonism) created the earth, under the direction of God the Father, as a place where humanity would be tested.  After the resurrection all men and women except spirits that followed Lucifer and the sons of perdition would be assigned one of three degrees of glory.  Within the highest degree, the Celestial Kingdom, there are three divisions, and those in the highest of these divisions would become gods and goddesses through a process called exaltation or "eternal progression".  The doctrine of eternal progression was succinctly summarized by Lorenzo Snow: “As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.”[tpl]citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/02/i-have-a-question?lang=eng |contribution= Is President Lorenzo Snow’s oft-repeated statement—“As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be”—accepted as official doctrine by the Church? |title= I Have a Question |first= Gerald N. |last= Lund |authorlink= Gerald N.

The Earth's creation, according to Mormon scripture, was not ex nihilo, but organized from existing matter.  The faith teaches that this earth is just one of many inhabited worlds, and that there are many governing heavenly bodies, including a planet or star Kolob which is said to be nearest the throne of God. According to the King Follett discourse, God the Father himself once passed through mortality like Jesus did, but how, when, or where that took place is unclear. The prevailing view among Mormons is that God once lived on a planet with his own higher god."An explanation of Mormon beliefs about God", BBC – Religions, 2009-10-02.Jana Riess and Christopher Kimball Bigelow, Mormonism for Dummies (John Wiley & Sons, 2005, ISBN 978-0-7645-7195-4) ch. 3.

[[Themes in Italian Renaissance painting]]
CATEGORIES: Paintings by theme, Italian Renaissance, Iconography

This article about the development of themes in Italian Renaissance painting is an extension to the article Italian Renaissance painting, for which it provides additional pictures with commentary. The works encompassed are from Giotto in the early 14th century to Michelangelo's Last Judgement of the 1530s.
The themes that preoccupied painters of the Italian Renaissance were those of both subject matter and execution- what was painted and the style in which it was painted. The artist had far more freedom of both subject and style than did a Medieval painter. Certain characteristic elements of Renaissance painting evolved a great deal during the period. These include perspective, both in terms of how it was achieved and the effect to which it was applied, and realism, particularly in the depiction of humanity, either as symbolic, portrait or narrative element.

[[Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates]]
CATEGORIES: Organic compounds, Starch, Polyols, Sugar alcohols

Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSHs) are mixtures of several sugar alcohols (a type of sugar substitute). Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates were developed by a Swedish company[tpl]who|date=May 2009[/tpl] in the 1960s. In the United States, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are provided by three manufacturers. The HSH family of polyols is an approved food ingredient in Canada, Japan, and Australia. HSH sweeteners provide 40 to 90% of the sweetness of sugar. 
Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are produced by the partial hydrolysis of starch – most often corn starch, but also potato starch or wheat starch. This creates dextrins (glucose and short glucose chains). The hydrolyzed starch (dextrin) then undergoes hydrogenation to convert the dextrins to sugar alcohols.
Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are similar to sorbitol: if the starch is completely hydrolyzed so that only single glucose molecules remain, then after hydrogenation the result is sorbitol. Because in HSHs the starch is not completely hydrolyzed, a mixture of sorbitol, maltitol, and longer chain hydrogenated saccharides (such as maltotriitol) is produced. When no single  polyol is dominant in the mix, the generic name hydrogenated starch hydrosylates is used. However, if 50% or more of the polyols in the mixture are of one type, it can be labeled as "sorbitol syrup", or "maltitol syrup", etc.

Tropical Storm Barry was a rapidly forming tropical cyclone that made landfall on Florida, United States, in early June 2007. The second named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a trough of low pressure in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 1. It tracked rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Tampa Bay as a tropical depression. Barry quickly lost tropical characteristics after wind shear removed much of the convection, and early on June 3 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants tracked up the East Coast of the United States, and were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on June 5.
The precursor trough produced heavy rainfall across the western Caribbean Sea, which on Cuba unofficially reached over 7.8 inches (200 mm). Outer rainbands in Pinar del Río Province injured three people and damaged 55 houses. In Florida, Barry dropped a moderate amount of precipitation across the drought-ridden state; rainfall peaked at 6.99 inches (178 mm). The rain caused some flooding and wet roads, which led to two indirect traffic fatalities. Rough seas killed one Florida surfer in Pinellas County. In Florida and Georgia, the precipitation assisted firefighters in combating severe wildfires. Overall damage from the storm was minor.

[[Censoring (statistics)]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical terminology, Statistical data types, Survival analysis, Reliability engineering, Unknown content

In statistics, engineering, economics, and medical research, censoring occurs when the value of a measurement or observation is only partially known.
For example, suppose a study is conducted to measure the impact of a drug on mortality rate.  In such a study, it may be known that an individual's age at death is at least 75 years (but may be more).  Such a situation could occur if the individual withdrew from the study at age 75, or if the individual is currently alive at the age of 75.  
Censoring also occurs when a value occurs outside the range of a measuring instrument.  For example, a bathroom scale might only measure up to 150 kg.  If a 175 kg individual is weighed using the scale, the observer would only know that the individual's mass is at least 150 kg.

The bicyclic nitroimidazole like molecule PA-824 has got a very complex mechanism of action active against both replicating and hypoxic, non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Microarray analysis of the mode of action of PA-824 showed a puzzling mixed effect both on genes responsive to both cell wall inhibition (like isoniazid) and respiratory poisoning (like cyanide). The aerobic killing mechanism of this drug appears to involve inhibition of cell wall mycolic acid biosynthesis through an as yet unknown molecular mechanism.The respiratory poisoning through nitric oxide release seemed to be a crucial element of anaerobic activity by PA-824. The effect of PA-824 on the respiratory complex under hypoxic non-replicating conditions was also manifested in a rapid drop in intracellular ATP levels, again similar to that observed by cyanide treatment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Manjunatha U, Boshoff IM Helena, Barry CE |title=The mechanism of action of PA-824 |journal=Commun Integr Biol. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=215-218 |date=May–Jun 2009 |pmc=2717523[/tpl]

[[Ernest Borel]]

CATEGORIES: Watch manufacturing companies of Switzerland, Companies established in 1856

Ernest Borel is a watch manufacturer founded in 1856 in Neuchatel, Switzerland. They have traditionally focused on export markets outside Europe. They won several awards in the late 19th century, including first place in the 1866 Neuchatel observatory timing accuracy competition. This was viewed by the company as an important marketing strategy for increasing the brand's value, since the Neuchatel observatory was famed at the time for its timekeeping accuracy.

USS ''Pender County'' (LST-1080) was an LST-542-class tank landing ship in the United States Navy. Unlike many of her class, which received only numbers and were disposed of after World War II, she survived long enough to be named. On 1 July 1955, all LSTs still in commission were named for US counties or parishes; LST-1080 was given the name Pender County, after a county in North Carolina.
LST-1080 was laid down on 10 November 1944 at Hingham, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc.; launched on 2 May 1945; and commissioned on29 May 1945.
After shakedown, LST-1080 sailed for the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal. The landing ship performed logistics missions and service force lifts in the Pacific Ocean area throughout the remainder of World War II. After cessation of hostilities, she sailed for the west coast and upon arrival there reported to Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, Astoria, Oregon for inactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve 29 August 1946 and berthed in the Columbia River at Tongue Point.
In June 1950 the outbreak of hostilities in Korea caused the reactivation of many vessels of the mothball fleet, including LST-1080. She recommissioned 3 October 1950 and after a short shakedown cruise sailed for the Far East in February 1951, arriving in time to participate in the UN counteroffensive which pushed North Korean and Chinese armies back beyond the 38th parallel to a point where they were held for the remainder of the Korean War. During this time LST-1080 participated in many logistics and personnel lifts and made numerous voyages to and from the combat zone in Korea and the support areas in Japan. The ship returned to the U.S. in early 1952. After overhaul, she again sailed for the Far East in August 1952 to support United Nations forces defending against intensive communist offensive operations. She continued this duty until she sailed for home shortly before the cessation of hostilities. Upon arrival in the U.S., she was assigned to various training missions on the west coast.
In 1954, LST-1080 was again in the Far East, as a service force transport ferrying supplies and personnel to the United Nations units engaged in the task of reconstructing war-torn Korea. On 31 August 1954, she steamed out of Yokosuka, Japan, bound for Indo-China to participate in operation “Passage to Freedom” and made several trips from Haiphong to Tourane, Nha Trang and Saigon ferrying indigenous and French refugees and army personnel out of the area north of the 14th parallel. After leaving Indo-China 13 November 1954, LST-1080 visited Manila and Hong Kong before returning to the United States in February 1955.
On 1 July 1955, LST-1080 was named Pender County (LST-1080). She operated out of San Diego sailing for the Far East in the fall of 1956. She arrived at Kobe, Japan, 2 October 1956 and thereafter made four training cruises to areas of Okinawa and Iwo Jima to participate in amphibious warfare landing and invasion maneuvers with elements of the United States Marine Corps and Army. On 23 January 1957, she departed Yokosuka for home, arriving San Diego 21 February 1957. 
On 18 July 1957, she sailed for training maneuvers in the Hawaiian area, returning to San Diego for local operations 31 August 1957.
On 27 September 1957, Pender County arrived at Long Beach, California, for inactivation. On 2 October she was placed in commission in reserve, assigned to the Long Beach Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet and decommissioned 2 January 1958. She was struck from the Navy List 6 February 1959.
Under provisions of the Military Assistance Program, she was transferred to the Republic of Korea January 1959, and served the ROK navy as Hwa San (LST-816).
LST-1080 earned four battle stars for Korean War service.

 The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom, then shall I fear?

The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom then shall I be afraid?

Though a host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid;

And tho’ there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in Him.

For in the time of trouble, He shall hide me in His tabernacle.

Yea, in the secret places of His dwelling shall He hide me,

And set me up upon a rock of stone.

The Wild Goose Chase is a late Jacobean stage play, a comedy written by John Fletcher, first published in 1621. It is often classed among Fletcher's most effective and best-constructed plays; Edmund Gosse called it "one of the brightest and most coherent of Fletcher's comedies, a play which it is impossible to read and not be in a good humour."Gosse, p. 81. The drama's wit, sparkle, and urbanity anticipated and influenced the Restoration comedy of the later decades of the seventeenth century. The term "wild-goose chase" is first documented when used by Shakespeare in the early 1590s, but appears as a term with which his audience would be familiar, as there is no attempt to define its meaning.
