"Hourglass" became an unexpected U.S. hithttp://www.allmusic.com/album/babylon-and-on-mw0000195811/awards for the band, reaching #15 on the Billboard Hot 100, which Chris Difford attributed to the video for the song as much as the song itself. "I would think that the video has had a lot to do with it.  It’s been played a lot, and everybody you speak to compliments you on it.  When you meet fans after gigs, they say, “Your video’s great.”  They don’t say, “Your album’s great.”  So it’s the first thing they think of."

[[Academic Festival Overture]]
CATEGORIES: Compositions by Johannes Brahms, Overtures, 1880 compositions

Academic Festival Overture ([tpl]lang-de|Akademische Festouvertüre[/tpl]),That is, Festival-overture for the Academy; the German word Festouvertüre connotes a festive or celebratory overture and figures in the titles of Glazunov's Festouvertüre, and Luise Adolpha Le Beau's Festouvertüre für großes Orchester, among others. One occasionally sees Brahms' title written in English as "Academic Festival" Overture, but in the German title, the adjective "akademisch" modifies Festouvertüre, not Fest. It is the overture that is festive, not an "Academic Festival" occasioning it.  Op. 80, by Johannes Brahms, was one of a pair of contrasting concert overtures — the other being the Tragic Overture, Op. 81, written to balance it as its pair.  Brahms composed the Academic Festival Overture during the summer of 1880 as a musical "thank you" to the University of Breslau, which had awarded him an honorary doctorate the previous year.

Claude Moine (born 
July 3, 1942 Paris), better known by his stage name Eddy Mitchell, is a French singer and actor. He began his career in the late 1950s, with the group Les Chaussettes Noires (The Black Socks), taking his name from the American expatriate tough-guy actor Eddie Constantine (later the star of Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville). The band performed at the Parisian nightclub Golf-Drouot before signing to Barclay Records and finding almost instant success; in 1961 it sold two million records.
Heavily influenced by American rock & roll, Mitchell (who went solo in 1963) has often recorded outside France, at first in London, but later in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee. Guitarist Big Jim Sullivan, Jimmy Page and drummer Bobby Graham were among the British session musicians who regularly supported him in London. For his American recordings he employed session men such as Roger Hawkins, David Hood, Jimmy Johnson, Kenneth Buttrey, Reggie Young, David Briggs, Charlie McCoy and others.Happy Birthday, Eddy Mitchell, EM Productions, 1980, liner notes
A great lover of American films, he hosted "La Dernière Séance", a TV show about American cinema from 1981 to 1998 on FR3 (later France 3). Its format was like an old-fashioned double-feature picture show, with two movies, cartoons, newseels and stage attractions.

[[D. Boon and Friends]]

CATEGORIES: D. Boon compilation albums, 2003 compilation albums, Box-O-Plenty Records compilation albums

D. Boon and Friends is a music CD compiling various jam session and live recordings featuring Minutemen guitarist and frontman D. Boon.  The album is the inaugural release of the Hermosa Beach, California-based label Box-O-Plenty Records, started by Boon's one-time roommate Richard Derrick.  Most of the tracks are living-room jam sessions (on guitars, bass and cheap keyboards) done by Boon, Derrick, and Crane, who had previously contributed backing vocals and trumpet parts to the Minutemen's Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat and Project: Mersh 12-inch EP's.
Also heard on the album are live recordings of a one-time project band featuring Boon and three percussionists under the band name Hammerdown, a rare D. Boon acoustic solo show, a tape of a noontime Minutemen gig with Derrick substituting for drummer George Hurley (who couldn't get time off work to participate in the show), and an experimental demo recording featuring D. Boon  overdubbing three different lead guitar parts over a rhythm guitar track.
The cover art of D. Boon And Friends is derived from a Christmas card Boon had given Derrick in 1984.
Mike Watt, as curator of the Minutemen legacy, gave the project his blessing, as did D. Boon's late father. Watt, former Meat Puppets drummer Derrick Bostrom, Crane, and Richard Derrick all contributed liner notes.
In keeping with a Minutemen crediting tradition, Boon and many of the other participants are credited with "singing" instead of "vocals."
The first pressing of the CD had a purple cover.  Current pressings have the front cover printed with an off-yellow background.  Customers who order the CD directly from the label also receive a bonus 23-minute CD-R of other Boon/Crane/Derrick jam sessions and solo live tracks that didn't fit into the original track sequence.

Fish Creek is a tributary of the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatchewan, Canada, northeast of Saskatoon. 
It is most famous as the site of the Battle of Fish Creek during the Northwest Rebellion of 1885 between General Frederick Middleton of the Canadian Militia and Gabriel Dumont, adjutant general of the Metis Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. It also gives its name to the surrounding rural municipality. The area is part of the aspen parkland biome.
Fish Creek was the southern border of the Southbranch Settlement of French Métis who settled in the Saskatchewan Valley region in the mid to late 19th Century. They knew it as Tourond's Coulee.  Dumont chose to fight the battle at this natural border region as a defensive action with his outnumbered forces as the Canadian troops drove north. Dumont had less than sixty Métis, and this small force held off the Canadian troops for a day.  The fighting took place on April 24.
The battle proved to be a success for the Métis forces in that bloodied Middleton's nose and stalled the Canadian advance on Batoche, Saskatchewan; capital of Louis Riel's provisional government, for another two weeks.
Fish Creek also gives its name to a Saskatchewan rural municipality, Fish Creek No. 402 which encompasses the area today.

[[Street elbow]]

CATEGORIES: Plumbing

A street elbow (sometimes called a street ell or service ell) is a type of plumbing or piping fitting intended to join a piece of pipe and another fitting at an angle. The difference between a street elbow and a regular elbow is the nature of the connections on either end.
A regular elbow has a female hub or FIP connection on both ends. A hub is a female ABS, PVC or copper pipe receptacle;  FIP denotes "Female Iron Pipe" threads, that is, it receives threaded MIP iron, brass or plastic pipe on both ends.  FIP is also known as FPT, Female Pipe Thread, and MIP is also known as MPT, Male Pipe Thread. Collectively, these are known as National Pipe Thread (NPT) fittings.
Instead, a street elbow has a female fitting (hub or FIP) on one end and a male pipe or MIP fitting on the other end. The advantage of the street elbow is that it can be connected directly to another fitting without having to use an additional short connecting piece called a pipe nipple. 
Street elbows are available in 90°, 45° and 22.5° bends.  They can be used in water supply, drainage, sewers, vents, central vacuum systems, compressed air and gas lines, HVAC, sump pump drains, and any location where plumbing fittings would be used to join sections of pipe.
The Natural Gas and Propane Installation Code of Canada (B149.1) states "...a street elbow or a street tee shall not be used in a piping system".[tpl]elucidate|date=March 2013[/tpl]

[[Nelson Island (Trinidad and Tobago)]]

CATEGORIES: Islands of Trinidad and Tobago

Nelson Island, Trinidad and Tobago is one of the Five Islands which lie west of Port of Spain in the Gulf of Paria.
Nelson Island is famous as the disembarkation point and quarantine station for indentured immigrants to Trinidad and Tobago in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.  For this reason it has been called the Ellis Island of Trinidad and Tobago.
At Nelson Island the Indian immigrants and the ship, food and stores were inspected by the Protector of Immigrants. Their bundles and blankets were fumigated and they were quarantined and allowed to recover and regain strength. This measure was designed to prevent the spread of diseases which might have been transported from India. Special effort was made to stop the spread of smallpox and measles. At Nelson Island, the immigrants were examined by a medical doctor and then transported by small boats to Port of Spain. The healthy ones were immediately sent to estates, the sick ones went to the Colonial Hospital in Port of Spain and those who only needed rest were kept at the Depot in Port of Spain.
In the 1930s Nelson Island was used as a detention center for prisoners, among them Tubal Uriah Butler.  During World War II, the Americans built a gun emplacement at the eastern end of the island and a causeway to Rock Island to the west. Nelson Island became a detention center again in 1970 following the Black Power Revolution. Among those who were detained there were Oilfields Workers' Trade Union president George Weekes, National Joint Action Committee leader Geddes Granger, Apoesho Mutope, Winston Suite and Clive Nunez.

[[Streaked Xenops]]

CATEGORIES: Xenops, Woodcreepers

The Streaked Xenops (Xenops rutilans) is a passerine bird which breeds in the tropical New World from Costa Rica and Trinidad south to Bolivia and northern Argentina. Like the closely related true woodcreepers, it is a member of the South American bird family Furnariidae.
The Streaked Xenops is typically 4.8 in (12.2 cm) long, weighs 0.44 oz (12.6 g), and has a stubby wedge-shaped bill. The head is dark brown with a whitish supercilium and malar stripe. The upperparts are brown, becoming rufous on the tail and rump, and there is a buff bar on the darker brown wings. The underparts are white-streaked olive brown. Males and females looks alike. Visually inconspicuous, it is easier located by its chattering call, a series of 5 or 6 metallic zeet notes.
It is found in wet forests in foothills and mountains between 2,000-7,200 ft (600-2,200 m) ASL, and will utilize secondary forests and opened-up growth.de L. Fávaro et al. (2006) The Streaked Xenops is often difficult to see as it forages on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs; it moves in all directions on the trunk like a treecreeper, but does not use its tail as a prop. It feeds on arthropods such as the larvae of wood-boring beetles, but can also catch flying termites in mid-air.Olson & Alvarenga (2006) It joins mixed-species feeding flocks on a more or less regular basis depending on location, usually moving through the middle levels of the forest.Machado (1999), Olson & Alvarenga (2006)
The Streaked Xenops builds its nest by simply placing a few stems and roots in a hole 5–15 ft (1.5-4.5 m) high in a tree. The normal clutch is two white eggs, incubated by both sexes.

[[The Right to Read]]
CATEGORIES: Free content, Digital rights management, Free software

"The Right to Read" is a short story by Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, which was first published in 1997 in Communications of the ACM. It is a cautionary tale set in the year 2047, when DRM-like technologies are employed to restrict the readership of books: when the sharing of books and written material is a crime punishable by imprisonment.
In particular, it touches on the impact of such a system on the requirements of university students, one (Dan Halbert) of whom is forced into a dilemma in which he must decide whether to loan his computer to a fellow student (Lissa Lenz), who may or may not illegally access his purchased documents.
It is notable for being written before the use of Digital Rights Management technology was widespread (although DVD video discs which used DRM had appeared the year before, and various proprietary software since the 1970s had made use of some form of copy protection), and for predicting later hardware-based attempts to restrict how users could use content, such as Trusted Computing.

The Delaware and Hudson Canal was the first venture of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, which would later build the Delaware and Hudson Railway. Between 1828 and 1899, the canal's barges carried anthracite coal from the mines of Northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson River and thence to market in New York City. 
Construction of the canal involved some major feats of civil engineering, and led to the development of some new technologies, particularly in rail transport. Its operation stimulated the city's growth and encouraged settlement in the sparsely populated region. Unlike many other canals of that era, the canal remained a profitable private operation for most of its existence. 
For these reasons, the canal was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968. 
The canal was abandoned in the early 20th century, and much of it was subsequently drained and filled. A few fragments remain in New York and Pennsylvania, and are in use as parks and historic sites.

Messalonskee Lake is a body of water in the Belgrade Lakes region of Maine. It is bordered by the towns of Oakland, Sidney, and Belgrade. The lake is a 9 mile long, narrow, natural creation, resulting from continental collision and glacial scouring. A dam originally built in the town of Oakland in 1905 increased the lake's size.
In the first part of the 20th century, Messalonskee Stream provided waterpower for Oakland's Cascade Woolen Mill, as well as for a number of factories responsible for Oakland's long-defunct title as "axehead capital of the world."
Messalonskee Lake is home to a great variety of wildlife, including great blue herons, bass, yellow perch, white perch, sunfish, painted and snapping turtles, loons, and occasionally Bald Eagles can be seen soaring above the lake.  The surrounding community has recently formed the Messalonskee Lake Association in the interest of its protection and preservation.
Like some Maine lakes, Messalonskee Lake has seen infestations of Milfoil.http://www.snowpond.org/Milfoil.html Messalonskee Lake Association Milfoil Program

[[Proof of purchase]]
CATEGORIES: Promotion and marketing communications, Packaging

Proof of purchase is often required for sales promotions and manufacturer rebates as evidence that the customer purchased the product. When multiple purchases are required to redeem these rewards, it is referred to as a premium incentive or collector mechanic.
Traditional proof of purchase systems required the consumer to send some portion of the packaging, as defined by the product's manufacturer, or the sales invoice.
Unique codes printed on packaging are increasingly used as a mechanism for proof of purchase. Consumers can submit the code electronically for validation against a central database, thus establishing proof of purchase.  Such systems allow manufacturers to develop a direct relationship with the consumer, for use in short term sales promotions, loyalty systems and collection and profiling of consumer data.
Stores which accept returns may require proof of purchase, often in the form a receipt

[[Battle of Mount Gaurus]]

CATEGORIES: 4th-century BC conflicts, Battles involving the Roman Republic, Battles of the Samnite Wars, 342 BC

The Battle of Mount Gaurus, 343 BC,Livy, as was customary in Rome, dated the battle by noting which consuls held office that year, it was the year in which M. Valerius Corvus, for the third time, and A. Cornelius Cossus were consuls. When converted to the western calendar using the traditional Varronian chronology, which Livy did not use, this becomes 343 BC. However modern historians have shown that the Varronian chronology dates the First Samnite War four years too early due to inclusion of unhistorical "dictator years". Despite this known inaccuracy, the Varronian chronology remains in use by convention also in academic literature. Forsythe(2005), pp. 369–370 was the first battle of the First Samnite War and also the first battle fought between the Roman Republic and the Samnites. The battle is described by the Roman historian Livy (59 BC – AD 17) as part of the Book Seven of his history of Rome, Ab Urbe Condita where he narrates how the Roman consul Marcus Valerius Corvus won a hard-fought battle against the Samnites at Mount Gaurus, near Cumae, in Campania. Modern historians however believe that most, if not all, of the detail in Livy's description has been invented by him or his sources.

The E-series was a collection of successive humanoid robots created by the Honda Motor Company between the years of 1986 and 1993. These robots were only experimental, but later evolved into the Honda P series, with Honda eventually amassing the knowledge and experience necessary to create Honda's advanced humanoid robot: ASIMO. The fact that Honda had been developing the robots was kept secret from the public until the announcement of the Honda P2 in 1996.
E0, developed in 1986, was the very first robot. It walked in a straight line on two feet, in a manner resembling human locomotion, taking around 5 seconds to complete a single step. Quickly engineers realised that in order to walk up slopes, the robot would need to travel faster.[tpl]cite web | url = http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/history/e0.html | title = History of the Humanoids: E0 (1986) | accessdate = 2008-07-01 | publisher = Honda Motor Co., Ltd.

The 7800 was designed to replace Atari Inc.'s unsuccessful Atari 5200 and later to re-establish Atari Corp.'s market supremacy against Nintendo and Sega. With this system, Atari Inc. addressed all the shortcomings of the Atari 5200: it had simple digital joysticks; it was almost fully backward-compatible with the Atari 2600; and it was affordable (originally priced at US$140).
The following list contains all 59 licensed games, as well as an estimated 27 aftermarket games released on the Atari 7800.

Joseph Seraphim FortesGovernment of Canada 1901 Census records his name as "Joseph Fortis" (9 February 1863 - 4 February 1922) was a prominent figure in the early history of Vancouver.  He was born in Bridgetown, Barbados on February 9, 1863.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online After leaving his homeland in his mid-teens, he worked in Britain for several years. In 1884 he sailed around Cape Horn from Liverpool on the Robert Kerr, arriving in Burrard Inlet in September 1885. His name occurs repeatedly in the ship's log as Seraphim Fortes.
After the disastrous fire, which completely destroyed the recently incorporated City of Vancouver on June 13, 1886, Joe Fortes worked as a shoeshine boy and porter at the Sunnyside Hotel and as a bartender at the Bodega Saloon on Cordova and Carrall (Maple Tree Square in Gastown).
Making his home at English Bay, he lived in a tent on the beach during the milder months of the year. After the start of the 20th century, he moved into a cottage at the foot of Bidwell Street on the shore-side of Beach Avenue. His little house was later moved to the other side of the street, just east of Alexandra Park.
Joe Fortes devoted all of his free time to teaching children to swim and to patrolling the beach. The self-appointed unpaid guard continued to support himself by working odd jobs until, in 1900, the City appointed him its first official lifeguard.Our Friend Joe: The Joe Fortes Story
His contemporaries referred to him respectfully and lovingly as "Old Black Joe" or "English Bay Joe". The stocky, dark-skinned man was a friend and teacher to the children, a guard for the bathers and a hero to people in distress. He has been officially credited with saving 29 lives, yet it is believed that the real number is considerably higher.
In 1910 the City honoured Joe Fortes for his many years of service to the public by presenting him with a gold watch, a cheque and an illuminated address.
When Joe Fortes died on February 4, 1922, Vancouver held a record-breaking funeral procession for him. Mourners crowded into Holy Rosary Cathedral to bid farewell to a brave, kind and modest friend. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery. A flat stone marks his grave, simply inscribed: "JOE".
In June 1927 the citizens of Vancouver dedicated a monument to Joe Fortes. The fountain in Alexandra Park by sculptor Charles Marega bears the inscription: LITTLE CHILDREN LOVED HIM.
He is still remembered today. On May 20, 1976, the Joe Fortes Branch of the Vancouver Public Library was dedicated to his name and in 1985, one hundred years after he arrived in Canada, the Joe Fortes Seafood & Chop House restaurant opened.
In 1986, during Vancouver's centennial year, the Vancouver Historical Society named Joseph Seraphim Fortes "Citizen of the Century."The History of Metropolitan Vancouver
In 2002, he was the subject of a National Film Board of Canada animated short Joe, directed by Jill Haras with a voice cast featuring Blu Mankuma.[tpl]cite web|title=Joe|url=http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=51155|work=Collection page|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=17 April 2012[/tpl]

In quantum mechanics, the Renninger negative-result experiment is a thought experiment that illustrates some of the difficulties of understanding the nature of wave function collapse and measurement in quantum mechanics.  The statement is that a particle need not be detected in order for a quantum measurement to occur, and that the lack of a particle detection can also constitute a measurement.  The thought experiment was first posed in 1953 by Mauritius Renninger. It can be understood to be a refinement of the paradox presented in the  Mott problem.

[[Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser]]
CATEGORIES: 19th-century Austrian people, Austrian magicians, People from Vienna, 1806 births, 1875 deaths

Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser (June 19, 1806 – March 11, 1875) was a minor employee at the financial department of the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy. Although he never held a doctorate, and there is no such title in his working descriptions, he used the moniker "Dr. Hofzinser" as a stage name after retiring in 1865.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] As a magician he was best known for his clever conjuring inventions and refined sleight of hand skills.
Hofzinser is called the Father of Card-Magic by the most prominent representatives of modern card-artistry; magician Dai Vernon often mentioned Hofzinser in his books.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] In his day, Hofzinser's talents were famous throughout Europe.  From 1857 on, under the name of his wife Wilhemine, Hofzinser presented illusions in their apartment (Salon) for an elite audience of invited guests three or four times a week.  They called these gatherings Eine Stunde der Täuschung or "An Hour of Deception" and charged a relatively high price for admission.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] 1865 he went on tour with his show and was seen in Berlin, Munich and in most of the bigger cities in the Austrian Monarchy.
Hofzinser is famous for his minimalistic approach to performing his illusions.  Rather than presenting large-scale effects to impress his audience, Hofzinser focused on a simple setting using small props to demonstrate his skills.  Playing cards were one of Hofzinser's specialties and he was one of the earliest performers to demonstrate card tricks.  He invented many card manipulations, some of which continue to be used by magicians today.
FISCHER spread the story that upon his death in 1875, Hofzinser's wife destroyed many of his manuscripts to honor her husband's instructions though there is some dispute about this.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]  Even so, many of his mechanical plans and card-handling methods may forever remain a secret. Several of Hofzinser's pupils preserved portions of their teacher's notes and instructions.  There are still about 270 manuscripts and letters of his own and of his pupils in various collections.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
What was known about Hofzinser was mostly based on the work of Ottokar Fischer (1873-1940) who published his findings in his books, Kartenkünste (1910) and Zauberkünste (1942) though many of Fischer's findings turned out to be incorrect. In recent years, Austrian magician Magic Christian has discovered many new facts about the life and magic of Hofzinser, publishing them in his books Non Plus Ultra, originally available only in German.English version is now available in English from the Conjuring Arts Research Center and Hermetic Press Magic Christian is currently working on the third volume about Hofzinser's Salon Magic which will be edited at the end of 2007 by Edition Huber/ Offenbach. It is rumoured to include a section on illusions created in collaboration with Oliver Van Hoogstraten during the short but intensely productive time they spent in Vienna in the 1850s (uncited). There is no evidence of this added fact.
Johann Hofzinser should not be confused with Swedish magician Max Hofzinser (né Josef Levin in 1885).  Max adopted the surname "Hofzinser" after seeing it in a magic catalog[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] and spent most of his career riding the fame of his namesake.[tpl]POV-statement|date=December 2011[/tpl]  Max Hofzinser died in 1955.
He is portrayed by Philip McGough, in the 2006 movie The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti. Le Hofinzer est aussi un fromage produit depuis 1856 dans l'allier(03) FRANCE. L'usine HOFINZER est la principale productrice de ce fromage en FRANCE.

[[Intervalence charge transfer]]
CATEGORIES: Analytical chemistry, Coordination chemistry, Spectroscopy

In chemistry, intervalence charge transfer, often abbreviated IVCT or even IT, is an electron transfer (thermal or photoinduced) between two metal sites differing only in oxidation state. Quite often such electron transfer reverses the oxidation states of the sites. The term is frequently extended to the case of metal-to-metal charge transfer between non-equivalent metal centres. http://goldbook.iupac.org/I03125.html Article: intervalence charge transfer 
Typically, such a process produces a characteristic absorption in the electromagnetic spectrum of the compound involved. The phenomenon is most often observed in mixed-valence bi- and polymetallic coordination complexes. The IVCT band is usually observed in the visible or near infrared region of the spectrum and is broad.
The process can be described as follows:

[[Fourth Letts Executive]]
CATEGORIES: Northern Territory ministries

The Fourth Letts Executive was the fourth ministry to come from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in Australia. It oversaw the Northern Territory under Country Liberal Party Majority Leader Dr Goff Letts from December 1976 to September 1977. It came into existence not because of personnel changes, but as a result of a reshuffle to prepare for the 1977 election. Letts made a short-lived change with this executive, styling its members as "cabinet members" instead of "executive members", which was abandoned when Paul Everingham succeeded Letts as Majority Leader after the election.
While both the fourth and other early executives did not have anywhere near the range of powers as ministries after the granting of self-government in 1978, they nevertheless fulfilled similar functions. This executive was devastated at the 1977 election; five executive members (Goff Letts, Grant Tambling, Liz Andrew, Dave Pollock and Roger Ryan) were among the six Country Liberal Party members to lose their seats. Jim Robertson, MLA, while not technically a member of the executive, served as Manager of Government Business during this period.

[[Maran]]
CATEGORIES: Orthodox rabbinic roles and titles, Aramaic words and phrases

Maran is a title for exceptionally respected rabbis. The term is more prevalent among Sephardi Jews, but is also widely used by Ashkenazi Haredi Jews.
It is an Aramaic word used frequently in the Talmud which means 'our master' ([tpl]Lang|arc|מָרַן[/tpl], [tpl]Transl|arc|māran[/tpl], 'our master'). Most often, as the translation indicates, it is given to rabbis who are considered influential teachers and leaders.
Maran is also a surname used by people, mostly in the United States of America, such as the family of Josie Maran.
The most common use of the term is in reference to "Maran Beth Yosef", Rabbi Yosef Karo.  In fact, when used without further qualification, Maran usually refers to Rabbi Karo. Amongst contemporary Rabbis, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef is most closely associated with the honorific.
In contemporary parlance Maran is often attributed to Rabbis who serve as founding heads of a particular ideological/cultural movement.  This use is usually limited to communication within that particular movement. For example, within their respective communities Rabbi Elazar Shach (Maran HaRav Shach), Rosh Yeshivas Ponevitch, and Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, Satmar Rebbe often receive the title.
As with most honorifics, this title precedes the name: for example, one might say "Maran Rabbi Ovadia Yosef". Similarly to honorifics like doctor, it can also be used for direct addressing by itself when there is no ambiguity. When used with a name, it will almost always be followed by the (technically redundant) "Rabbi", as in the above example. It is never preceded by "the" in correct usage, though some journalists will make that mistake.
Syriac Christians, who use the Syriac variety of Aramaic, make reference to Jesus using exactly the same title (see Mar).
Apart from that, in Tamil Literature Maran lexically refers to "Desperado/Saviour/Couragious soldier/Defender" and similar meanings and pronounced as "Maarun". Tamil Peots at times, use this name with reference to Love as well. People in Southern Part of India and predominantly Tamil people who are fond of this language's taste use to name their descendants with this name, for instance, Dayanidhi Maran, Tamil Maran, ManiMaran, Marudhamaran, ElaMaran, Murasoli Maran etc.
Some peoples of MEENA Caste also write MARAN in Madhya Pradesh in place of MEENA Caste, for instance  SwaDesh Maran,  DevRaj Maran  etc. of Meena Caste Write Maran.

[[Octobass]]

CATEGORIES: Bowed instruments, Double basses, Contrabass instruments

The octobass is an extremely large bowed string instrument constructed about 1850 in Paris by the French luthier Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume (1798-1875).  It has three strings and is essentially a larger version of the double bass (the specimen in the collection of the Musée de la Musique in Paris measures 3.48 meters in length, whereas a full size double bass is generally approximately 2 meters in length).  Because of the impractically large size of its fingerboard and thickness of its strings, the strings were stopped by the use of an intricate system of hand- and foot-activated levers and pedals.  The instrument was, in fact, so large that it took two musicians to play:  one to bow and the other to control the "fingering", and was consequently never produced on a large scale or used much by composers (although Hector Berlioz wrote favorably about the instrument and proposed its widespread adoption). In addition to the Paris instrument, another octobass is in the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, Arizona.
Berlioz writes in his Orchestration Treatise that its lowest string is tuned to C1 (32.7 Hz), one octave below the lowest C of the cello (C2, 64.14 Hz). This note is the same as the lowest note of a modern double bass with a low C extension. The middle string is tuned to G1, a fifth above the lowest string. The uppermost string is tuned to C2, an octave above the instrument's lowest string. Berlioz quotes G2, a fifth above the top string, as the highest note playable on the instrument, giving it a compass of  an octave and a fifth.  However, Berlioz may have been mistaken because modern and surviving instruments are tuned C, G, C, with the low C string being 16.25 Hz (C0, one octave below the lowest C on the piano).[tpl]Fact|date=June 2008[/tpl] The modern technique of octobass playing includes the technique of fingering up to A, plus higher notes possible by extended technique.[tpl]Fact|date=June 2008[/tpl] Recent pieces including octobass parts include Genesis and Four Poems by the American composer Adam Gilberti.
A similar but more recent instrument, the triple contrabass viol, has appeared on a recording by the American composer Roscoe Mitchell.

[[Utkal Plains]]

CATEGORIES: Plains of India

The Utkal Plains are coastal plains in the Odisha state of eastern India.  They include the delta of the Mahanadi River, Brahmani River, Baitarani River. Ranges from Swarnarekha River in north to Chilika in south http://w3.whosea.org/en/Section10/Section332/Section519_2390.htm.
Utkal Plains, coastal plains in eastern Orissa state, eastern India. Extending over about 16,000 square miles (41,400 square km), the plains are bounded by the Lower Ganges (Ganga) Plain to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Tamilnad Plains to the south, and the Eastern Ghats to the west. The Utkal Plains are coastal lowlands consisting chiefly of Mahanadi delta deposits and marine sediments, and they merge with the Eastern Ghats at an elevation of about 250 feet (76 metres). The plains have a nearly straight shoreline.
Paleogene and Neogene alluvium (from about 65 to 2.6 million years ago) with patches of ancient Archean gneiss and sandstone (from about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago), the plains are widest in the deltaic regions. Sand dunes of decomposed granites and zircon, created mainly by the action of wind at low tide, and lagoons are found along the Bay of Bengal. Chilka, the largest lake in the region (in the southwest), is salty; Samang and Sur (north and northeast of Puri, respectively) are freshwater lakes. Littoral forests are found along the coast of the Cuttack and Balasore areas, and tropical moist deciduous forests are found inland throughout the regions near Puri and Cuttack. The Mahanadi, Brahmani, Baitarani, and Subarnarekha rivers are often subject to heavy flooding; the combined outflow of these rivers has formed the Mahanadi delta in the northern part of the plains. The region has fertile red and black soils.
Agriculture is the main occupation, and rice is the principal crop; pulses (legumes) and oilseeds are also grown. Major irrigation projects located in the plains permit double-cropping. Industry, centred in Cuttack, Bhubaneshwar, and Puri along the Kolkata-Chennai (Calcutta-Madras) railway, includes paper mills, refrigerator plants, and the production of ceramics, glass, refractories, textiles, and galvanized pipe. The plains have a network of roads and railways, inland waterways in Cuttack, and an airfield at Bhubaneshwar.
Buddhism flourished in the Utkal Plains in the 3rd century ce under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, and the region is described in the rock edicts of Dhauli as forming part of the ancient Kalinga territory. Successive ancient dynasties including the Satavahanas, Karas, and Eastern Gangas ruled the region until, in the latter half of the 16th century, it passed to the Muslims and later to the Marathas. The British assumed control of the plains in 1804.

[[Viscosity index]]
CATEGORIES: Lubricants, Oil additives

Viscosity index (VI) is an arbitrary measure for the change of viscosity with variations in temperature. It is used to characterize viscosity changes with relation to temperature in lubricating oil.
The viscosity of liquids decreases as temperature increases. The viscosity of a lubricant is closely related to its ability to reduce friction. Generally, the least viscous lubricant which still forces the two moving surfaces apart is desired. If the lubricant is too viscous, it will require a large amount of energy to move (as in honey); if it is too thin, the surfaces will come in contact and friction will increase.
Many lubricant applications require the lubricant to perform across a wide range of conditions, for example, automotive lubricants are required to reduce friction between engine components when the engine is started from cold (relative to the engine's operating temperatures) up to [tpl]convert|200|°C|0|disp=or[/tpl] when it is running. The best oils with the highest VI will remain stable and not vary much in viscosity over the temperature range.  This allows for consistent engine performance within the normal working conditions.
The VI scale was set up by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The temperatures chosen arbitrarily for reference are [tpl]convert|100|and|210|°F|°C|0[/tpl]. The original scale only stretched between VI=0 (lowest VI oil, naphthenic) and VI=100 (best oil, paraffinnic) but since the conception of the scale better oils have also been produced, leading to VIs greater than 100 (see below). 
VI improving additives and higher quality base oils are widely used nowadays which increase the VIs attainable beyond the value of 100.  The Viscosity Index of synthetic oils ranges from 80 to over 400.
The viscosity index can be calculated using the following formula:
where V indicates the viscosity index, U the kinematic viscosity at [tpl]convert|40|°C|0[/tpl], and L & H are various values based on the kinematic viscosity at [tpl]convert|100|°C|0[/tpl] available in ASTM D2270.Engineering Tribology (2nd Edition).

The character is portrayed by Canadian actor Paul Gross.  Fraser's seemingly strange habits, such as tasting evidence and holding the door for anyone and everyone, add hilarity and whimsy to the show.
As Fraser often explains; "I first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father, and for reasons that don't need exploring at this juncture I have remained, attached as liaison with the Canadian Consulate."[tpl]cite web| title =I first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father| date =2002-07-14 | url =http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1331630 | accessdate =2007-10-26[/tpl]  Fraser is a strait-laced Canadian, and his faith in the honour and goodness of others tends to lead to interesting and humorous moments.

His other "best friend," a deaf half-wolf, Diefenbaker, named after the Canadian Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, reads lips in both English and Inuktitut, and often assists in the capture of criminals.  In the third and fourth seasons of the show, Fraser teamed up with Detective Stanley Raymond Kowalski, after Ray Vecchio went undercover in the Las Vegas Mafia.
He is usually called "Fraser" by his friends and colleagues - some old friends will call him Benton or Ben at times. Ray calls him Benny or Fraser, (often mispronouncing it "Fray-sure" as in the NBC sitcom Frasier).

The Everingham Executive was the fifth ministry to come from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. It was also the last to have been officially referred to as an executive rather than a ministry, and the last to have the rather limited powers that came with holding office in the Northern Territory before the granting of full self-government in 1978.
It came into existence after the bizarre events of the 1977 election; while the Country Liberal Party government was easily re-elected, five of its seven executive members, including its leader, Dr Goff Letts, lost their seats. This required significant changes to their executive, including the election of Paul Everingham as party leader, the promotion to higher-profile positions of the two other surviving members, Marshall Perron and Ian Tuxworth, and the promotion of two other members, Jim Robertson and Roger Steele to the executive. The executive then governed the Territory under new Majority Leader Everingham from September 1977 until the granting of self-government in June 1978.

[[All Bar One]]
CATEGORIES: Pub chains

All Bar One is a chain of just under 50 bars in the United Kingdom, owned and operated by Mitchells and Butlers plc which was part of the Six Continents group (previously Bass) until 2003.
The concept was designed by Bass as a 'female friendly' bar at a time when most pubs and bars were intimidating places for single women to go and drink or eat, hence the huge glass frontage, the open plan space and the bright airy interiors. The new venue followed the lead of other female friendly concept bars that already existed, such as Pitcher & Piano and Slug and Lettuce.
The first bar was opened in 1994 in Sutton town centre (in the London Borough of Sutton).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mbplc.com/ourbrands/allbarone/ |title=Mitchells & Butlers - Our brands - All Bar One |publisher=Mbplc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-23[/tpl] In 2012, there are 47 outlets in the UK, mostly based in Central London with one site in Cologne, Germany.
A recent multi-million pound investment program has updated the bars with a more modern feel but still retaining the characteristic wooden floors, bright open spaces and glass frontage.
All Bar One attracts a mature guest base due to its strict 21+ policy.

[[Tragic Overture]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Johannes Brahms, Overtures, 1880 compositions

The Tragic Overture (German: Tragische Ouvertüre), Op. 81, is a concert overture for orchestra written by Johannes Brahms during the summer of 1880. It premiered on 26 December 1880 in Vienna. Most performances last between twelve and fifteen minutes.
Brahms chose the title "Tragic" to emphasize the turbulent, tormented character of the piece, in essence a free-standing symphonic movement, in contrast to the mirthful ebullience of a companion piece he wrote the same year, the Academic Festival Overture. Despite its name, the Tragic Overture does not follow any specific dramatic program. Brahms was not very interested in musical storytelling and was more concerned with conveying and eliciting emotional impressions. He summed up the effective difference between the two overtures when he declared "one laughs while the other cries." Brahms quotes some material from the last movement of the Second Symphony in this overture. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

The Tragic Overture comprises three main sections, all in the key of D minor.
Theorists have disagreed in analyzing the form of the piece: Jackson finds Webster's multifarious description rather obscurist and prefers to label the work's form as a "reversed sonata design" in which the second group is recapitulated before the first, with Beethoven's Coriolan Overture as a possible formal model.Timothy L.

[[Critical literacy]]

CATEGORIES: Pedagogy, Critical pedagogy

Critical literacy is an instructional approach, stemming from Marxist critical pedagogy, that advocates the adoption of "critical" perspectives toward text. Critical literacy encourages readers to actively analyze texts and offers strategies for what proponents describe as uncovering underlying messages. There are several different theoretical perspectives on critical literacy that have produced different pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning. All of these approaches share the basic premise that literacy requires the literate consumers of text to adopt a critical and questioning approach. 
According to proponents of critical literacy, the practice is not simply a means of attaining literacy in the sense of improving the ability to decode words, syntax, etc. In fact, the ability to read words on paper is not necessarily required in order to engage in a critical discussion of "texts," which can include television, movies, web pages, music, art and other means of expression. The important thing is being able to have a discussion with others about the different meanings a text might have and teaching the potentially critically literate learner how to think flexibly about it.
Critical literacyHagood, M. (2002). "Critical literacy for whom?",Reading Research and Instruction, 41, 247-264. has become a popular approach to teaching English to students in some English speaking-countries,Cadeiro-Kaplan, K.

" CRITICAL LITERACY: Policy and Practice.", ". Orbit 36: 27. New Zealand, and the UK.
For post-structuralist practitioners of critical literacy, the definition of this literacy practice can be quite malleable, but usually involves a search for discourses and reasons why certain discourses are included or left out of a text. [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
Two major theoretical perspectives within the field of critical literacy are the Neo-Marxist/Freirean and the Australian. These approaches overlap in many ways and they do not necessarily represent competing views, but they do approach the subject matter differently.

[[Sacagawea dollar]]

CATEGORIES: United States dollar coins

The Sacagawea dollar (also known as the "golden dollar") is a United States dollar coin that has been minted every year since 2000, although not released for general circulation from 2002 through 2008 and again from 2012 onward due to its general unpopularity with the public and low business demand for the coin. These coins have a copper core clad by manganese brass, giving them a distinctive golden color.  The coin features an obverse by Glenna Goodacre.  From 2000 to 2008, the reverse featured an eagle design by Thomas D. Rogers.  Since 2009, the reverse of the Sacagawea dollar has been changed yearly, with each design in the series depicting a different aspect of Native American cultures.
The coin was first suggested as a replacement for the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. The Statue of Liberty was originally proposed as the design subject, but Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of the Lewis and Clark expedition, was eventually chosen.
The new dollar coin was heavily marketed by the Mint in a series of print, radio, and television advertisements, as well as Mint partnerships with Walmart and Cheerios.  However, the Sacagawea dollar did not prove popular with the public, and mintage dropped sharply in the second year of production.  Production of Sacagawea dollars continued, since 2007 in parallel with the U.S. Presidential dollars. In 2012, mintage numbers were reduced by over 90%, in line with a similar reduction for the Presidential Dollars, due to large stockpiles of unused dollar coins.
The Mint planned to issue the Sacagawea design in 22-karat gold as well, but this idea was quickly abandoned after the Mint's authority to strike the coins was questioned, and the Mint has retained ownership of the few such coins produced.  Soon after initial production of the dollar, it was noticed that a few of the dollar coins were erroneously struck with the obverse of a state quarter and the normal reverse.

[[Seated Liberty dollar]]
CATEGORIES: Coins of the United States, Liberty symbols, United States dollar coins, United States silver coins

The Seated Liberty dollar was a one-dollar coin struck by the United States Mint from 1840 to 1873 and designed by its chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht.  It was the last silver coin of that denomination to be struck before passage of the Coinage Act of 1873, which temporarily ended production of the silver dollar for American commerce. The coin's obverse is based on that of the Gobrecht dollar, which had been minted experimentally from 1836 to 1839. However, the soaring eagle used on the reverse of the Gobrecht dollar was not used; instead, the United States Mint (Mint) placed a heraldic eagle, based on a design by late Mint Chief Engraver John Reich first used on coins in 1807.
Seated Liberty dollars were initially struck only at the Philadelphia Mint; in 1846, production began at the New Orleans facility. In the late 1840s, the price of silver increased relative to gold because of an increase in supply of the latter caused by the California gold rush; this led to the hoarding, export, and melting of American silver coins. The Coinage Act of 1853 decreased the weight of all silver coins of five cents or higher, except for the dollar, but also required a supplemental payment from those wishing their bullion struck into dollar coins.  As little silver was being presented to the Mint at the time, production remained low. In the final years of the series, there was more silver produced in the US, and mintages increased.
In 1866, "In God We Trust" was added to the dollar following its introduction to United States coinage earlier in the decade. Seated Liberty dollar production was halted by the Coinage Act of 1873, which authorized the Trade dollar for use in foreign commerce.  Representatives of silver interests were unhappy when the metal's price dropped again in the mid-1870s; they advocated the resumption of the free coinage of silver into legal tender, and after the passage of the Bland-Allison Act in 1878, production resumed with the Morgan dollar.

[[Eleotridae]]
CATEGORIES: Eleotridae, Fish genera

Sleeper gobies are members of the Eleotridae fish family, found predominantly in the tropical Indo-Pacific, with about 35 genera and 150 species. While many eleotrids pass through a planktonic stage in the sea and some spend their entire lives in the sea, as adults, the majority live in freshwater streams and brackish waters. A few species (e.g., Milyeringa, Typhleotris and some Bostrychus) are troglobitic. They are especially important as predators in the freshwater stream ecosystems on oceanic islands such as New Zealand and Hawaii that otherwise lack the predatory fish families typical of nearby continents, such as catfish. Anatomically, they are similar to the gobies (Gobiidae), though unlike the majority of gobies, they do not have a pelvic sucker.Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 264, 1997, ISBN 978-0-86542-256-8
Like the true gobies, they are generally small fish that live on the substrate, often amongst vegetation, in burrows, or in crevices within rocks and coral reefs. Although goby-like in many ways, sleeper gobies lack the pelvic fin sucker, and that, together with other morphological differences, is used to distinguish the two families. Gobiidae and Eleotridae likely share a common ancestor, and they are both placed in the suborder Gobioidei, along with a few other small families containing goby-like fishes.
Dormitator and Eleotris, two of the most widespread and typical genera, include a variety of species that inhabit marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats. For example, the fat sleeper goby (Dormitator maculatus) grows to over 1 ft (30 cm) and is widely found in fresh to brackish and shallow marine waters of the southeastern United States and Mexico.Hoedeman, J.: Naturalist's Guide to Freshwater Aquarium Fish, Elsevier, pp 1096-1099, 1974, ISBN 978-0-8069-3722-9 Some predatory sleeper gobies grow much larger, such as the marbled sleeper goby, Oxyeleotris marmorata, a freshwater species from Southeast Asia that can grow to 2 ft (60 cm) long.Riehl R. & Baensch H: Aquarium Atlas (vol. 1), p. 832, Voyageur Press, 1996, ISBN 978-3-88244-050-8 However, most are much smaller, such as the fresh and brackish water species from Australia like Hypseleotris spp., known locally as gudgeons (not to be confused with the Eurasian freshwater cyprinid Gobio gobio, also known as the gudgeon and after which the Australian sleeper gobies were likely named).Riehl R. & Baensch H: Aquarium Atlas (vol. 2), pp 1063-1073, Microcosm Ltd, 1997, ISBN 978-1-890087-06-7

Christen Christensen Raunkiær (29 March 1860 – 11 March 1938) was a Danish botanist, who was a pioneer of plant ecology. He is mainly remembered for his scheme of plant strategies to survive an unfavourable season ("life forms") and his demonstration that the relative abundance of strategies in floras largely corresponded to the Earth's climatic zones. This scheme, the Raunkiær system, is still widely used today and may be seen as a precursor of modern plant strategy schemes, e.g. J. Philip Grime's CSR system.

[[Samson Raphaelson]]

CATEGORIES: American screenwriters, Writers Guild of America Award winners, 1894 births, 1983 deaths, Jewish American dramatists and playwrights

Samson Raphaelson (b. New York City; 1894–1983) was a leading American playwright, screenwriter and short story author in the first half of the 20th century. Over a single weekend he transformed his short story “Day of Atonement” into his first play, The Jazz Singer. Following its successful run on Broadway, Warner Brothers studios made it into the first successful talking picture in 1927, starring Al Jolson. Although Raphaelson’s immense admiration of Jolson as a stage performer had inspired his short story “Day of Atonement,” he did not write the screenplay of The Jazz Singer, preferring to concentrate on writing for the stage. 
In the 1930s, however, he became active in Hollywood as well as on Broadway. His screenplays for Ernst Lubitsch, perhaps that era’s most admired director of sophisticated comedies, included “Trouble in Paradise,” The Shop Around the Corner, and Heaven Can Wait. They prompted this accolade from Pauline Kael, the eminent film critic of The New Yorker:  
 Raphaelson took the giddiest inspirations and then polished his dialogue until it had the gleam of appliquéd butterfly wings on a Ziegfield girl’s toque, but the skeletal strength of his screenplays was what made it possible for the ideas and the words to take flight.Samson Raphaelson, Three Screenplays by Samson Raphaelson (Madison, WI: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1983) 15. 
One of Raphaelson’s best known screenplays is Suspicion (1941), directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In 1977, Raphaelson received the Laurel Award for lifetime achievement in screenwriting from the Writers Guild of America.

Pompeys Pillar National Monument is a rock formation located in south central Montana, United States. Designated a National Monument on January 17, 2001, and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, it consists of only [tpl]convert|51|acre[/tpl], making it one of the smallest National Monuments in the U.S. It was previously designated a National Historic Landmark on July 25, 1965. The new Pompeys Pillar Interpretive Center opened in 2006. Exhibits in the 5,700-square foot center relate the journey of Captain William Clark and his detachment, including Sacagawea and her son Pomp, down the Yellowstone River Valley in 1806.
The pillar itself stands 150 feet (45 m) above the Yellowstone River and consists of sandstone from the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation, 75 – 66 million years ago. The base of the pillar is approximately [tpl]convert|1|acre|ha|1[/tpl].
The pillar features an abundance of Native American petroglyphs, as well as the signature of William Clark, co-leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Clark's inscription is the only remaining physical evidence found along the route that was followed by the expedition.
The inscription consists of his signature and the date, July 25, 1806. Clark wrote that he climbed the sandstone pillar and "had a most extensive view in every direction on the Northerly Side of the river". He named the outcropping after Jean Baptiste Charbonneau—the son of expedition member Sacagawea—whom he nicknamed "Pompy". His original name for it was "Pompys Tower"; it was changed to the current title in 1814.
Situated 25 miles (40 km) northeast of Billings, Montana, along Interstate 94, the pillar gets 50,000 visitors annually. Archeological evidence suggests that the outcropping has been witness to 11,000 years of human involvement in the area. Consequently, in addition to the pictographs and the signature of William Clark, hundreds of other people have carved their initials into the rock, including early pioneers to the area.

Godley) brother of Axiochus, and member of the Alcmaeonidae family, was an Athenian who married Deinomache, the daughter of Megacles, and became the father of the famous Alcibiades. Plutarch tells us that he traced his family line back to Eurysaces, the son of Telamonian Ajax. He greatly distinguished himself in the Battle of Artemisium in 480 BC. Cleinias died at the Battle of Coronea in 447 BC.
He is also credited with the Cleinias Decree, which involved the tightening up of the process of tribute collection in the Athenian Empire. Attributing this inscription to this particular Cleinias, the father of Alcibiades, places the decree in the early 440s, usually given as 447, as Cleinias died at the Battle of Coronea in 447.

The Ballades, Op. 10, were some of the finest examples of lyrical piano music written by Johannes Brahms during his youth.  They were dated 1854 and were dedicated to his friend Julius Otto Grimm.  Their composition coincided with the beginning of the composer's lifelong affection for Clara Schumann, the wife of Robert Schumann, who was helping Brahms launch his career.  Frédéric Chopin had written the last of his famous ballades only 12 years earlier, but Brahms approached the genre differently from Chopin, choosing to take its origin in narrative poetry more literally.Charles Rosen (1998).

Brahms's ballades are arranged in two pairs of two, the members of each pair being in parallel keys.  The first ballade was inspired by a Scottish poem "Edward" found in a collection Stimmen der Völker in ihren Liedern compiled by Johann Gottfried Herder.  It is also one of the best examples of Brahms's bardic or Ossianic style; its open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies are supposed to evoke the sense of a mythological past.  
The tonal center of each ballade conveys an interconnectedness between the four pieces: the first three each include the key signature of the ballade that follows it somewhere as a tonal center, and the fourth ends in the key signature of D major/B minor despite cadencing in B major.  
Brahms returned to the wordless ballade form in writing the third of the Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118.  His Op. 75 vocal duets titled "Ballads and Romances" include a setting of the poem "Edward"—the same that inspired Op. 10, No. 1.
A number of famous pianists have played some or all of the Ballades, incluing Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Artur Rubinstein, Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, Glenn Gould, Wilhelm Kempff, Julius Katchen, Krystian Zimerman and Claudio Arrau.

[[Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118 (Brahms)]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Johannes Brahms, Solo piano pieces, 1893 compositions

The Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118, are some of the most beloved items that the composer Johannes Brahms wrote for the solo instrument.  Completed in 1893 and dedicated to Clara Schumann, the collection was the second to last composition to be published during Brahms' lifetime. It was also his second to last work composed for piano solo. Like Brahms' other late keyboard works, Op. 118 is overall more introspective than his earlier piano pieces, which tend to be more virtuosic in character. The six pieces are:

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Johannes Brahms, Solo piano pieces, 1879 compositions, Rhapsodies, Compositions in B minor, Compositions in G minor

The Rhapsodies, Op. 79, for piano were written by Johannes Brahms in 1879 during his summer stay in Pörtschach, when he had reached the maturity of his career.  They were inscribed to his friend, the musician and composer Elisabeth von Herzogenberg.  At the suggestion of the dedicatee, Brahms reluctantly renamed the sophisticated compositions from "klavierstücke" (piano pieces) to "rhapsodies".
In each piece, the main key is not definitely established until fairly late in the exposition.

Communism in Poland can trace its origins to early 20th century, as is the case in geographically nearby countries. The first significant Polish Marxist was Stanisław Brzozowski (1878–1911). 
During the interwar period in the Second Polish Republic, some Polish communists formed a political party, the Communist Party of Poland (Komunistyczna Partia Polski, KPP). Most of the original KPP members and leaders perished during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. 
In 1943, Stalin made efforts to rebuild Polish communist party. He created Union of Polish Patriots, to become an agent to aid the legitimization of puppet state he planned to set up in war-ridden Poland. This led to the creation of People's Republic of Poland and Polish United Workers' Party. Having little popularity, majority of Polish communists were dependent on support of the Soviet Union.
There were also repeated attempts by some Polish academics and philosophers, like Leszek Kołakowski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz and Stanisław Ossowski to develop, as a slowly eroding opposition, a specific form of Polish Marxism. While their attempts to create a bridge between Poland's history and Soviet Marxism ideology were mildly successful, especially in comparison to similar efforts in most other countries of the Eastern Bloc, they have been to much extent stifled by the regime's unwillingness to step too far and risk the wrath of Soviets for going too far from the Soviet party line.
In modern Poland, post-1989, communists have a minimal impact on political and economical life of the country. However some former communists, who were in their thirties during the fall of communism and took part in it, building the post-soviet political system, still remained active on the political scene. Their party, Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), is center-left and is one of the major political parties in Poland.

He had reigned only four months, during which period he had already driven into exile eighty of the citizens, when the citadel of Sicyon (which had narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the Aetolians shortly before) was surprised in the night by a party of Sicyonian exiles, headed by young Aratus. The palace of the tyrant was set on fire, but Nicocles himself made his escape by a subterranean passage, and fled from the city. Of his subsequent fortunes nothing is known.Plutarch, Lives,  "Life of Aratus", 3-9,  "Life of Philopoemen" 1;   Pausanias, Description of Greece,  ii. 8;  Cicero,  De officiis, ii. 23

[[Slayton Arboretum]]

CATEGORIES: Arboreta in Michigan, Botanical gardens in Michigan, Protected areas of Hillsdale County, Michigan, Hillsdale College, Protected areas established in 1922

thumb|rightSlayton Arboretum, 14 acres (5.7 hectares), is an arboretum located adjacent to the campus of Hillsdale College in Hillsdale, Michigan. It is privately owned but open to the public.
Although the site's use by the College students dates back to at least the 1860s, the Arboretum began in 1922 when Mr. and Mrs. George A. Slayton donated 14 acres (5.7 hectares) to Hillsdale College. By 1924, the first donated plantings were in place, led by Professor Bertram A. Barber. A pond was excavated in 1928, and a field station, a hillside rock garden, waterfall, and pump house were added in 1929. In the early 1930s two bridges were added, and an amphitheater built in the late 1930s on the site of a former gravel pit.
thumb|leftOn October 17, 1999 the Arboretum was the site of a suicide or murder when Lissa Jackson Roche, the managing editor of Hillsdale College Press, was found dead of a gunshot wound after claiming that she and her father-in-law, the college's president, had been involved in a nineteen-year extramarital affair.
The initial period of development of Slayton Arboretum under Professor Barber resulted in an intimate botanical garden much loved by students and alumni of Hillsdale College as well as the residents of Hillsdale. It was the focal point for student outdoor activity in biology and ecology. The rock gardens, waterfalls, gazebos, amphitheater and rustic cement bridges have survived virtually intact. The arboretum occupies the site of a disused gravel pit, and it is the distinct topography of the site along with the coniferous trees planted during Barber's directorship that provide the garden with its special charm. These original plantings matured over forty years of benign neglect following the demise of Professor Barber. 
In the early 1990s the arboretum was re-discovered as an important asset to the college and recovery of the site was begun under the direction of Dr. David Crabtree. Alumni and student support for the renewal of plantings and the conservation of the original structural elements was important in the restoration of the gardens during this time period. Today the gardens are notable for stately mature trees, semi-natural settings, and collections of conifers, magnolia, viburnum, witchhazel, mountain ash, maple, oak, and hickory as well as several genera of hardy deciduous shrubs.
The site is of considerable interest to ecologists in that several species of exotic woody shrubs have naturalized in the area to the exclusion of the native woody flora. The exotic shrubs that have become rampant are common buckthorn and common privet. Preferential deer herbivory of native species seems to be the primary cause of this invasion, and a deer exclusion has been attempted. The arboretum also has heavy and repeated infestation with Japanese beetle and this may also play a role in the dynamics of the shrub community which has developed in the garden over the last seventy years. The arboretum is currently directed by Dr. Ranessa Cooper and hosts art programs and children's programs during the summer.
As of late 2013 the arboretum underwent a renovation. The college has added a waterfall and the arboretum is open to the public once again.

CATEGORIES: 1961 births, Living people, German journalists

Hans-Martin Tillack is a German reporter. Born 1961 in Königs Wusterhausen near Berlin, he grew up in Stuttgart.
He studied politology and sociology in Marburg and Berlin, worked for five years as reporter for taz before coming to Stern in 1993 – first in Bonn, from 1999 to 2004 in Brussels, today in Berlin.
In 2005, he received the Leipziger Medienpreis for his EU reporting.
He was the most efficient in exposing Eurostat scandal, the EU statistical body based in Luxembourg. Working for German news magazine Stern, for months he wrote his successive findings and Stern magazine published his revelations about hidden accounts and fictitious contracts. Until May 16 2003 when Financial Times headlines revealed "A vast enterprise for looting community funds". Two top French managers were removed from office and the whole Eurostat directorate was dismissed. Six separate fraud investigations into Eurostat were required by OLAF, the EU anti-fraud body.
Subsequently Hans-Martin Tillack was arrested by Belgian police at the instigation of authorities of the European Union, whose bodies he was investigating in relation to allegations of fraud. OLAF suggested that the reporter had bribed EU officials in order to gather documents for an article he published in 2002 on alleged irregularities in OLAF.
An action by Belgian police followed that resulted in the journalist being detained by the police for several hours, his home and office being searched, and possessions including 16 boxes of documents, two archive boxes, two computers and four mobile phones being seized.
In 2007, the European Court of Human Rights judged that Hans-Martin Tillack's right not to reveal his sources of information had been violated and asked Belgium to pay him €10,000 for moral damages as well as €30,000 in costs.
The hundreds of pages of seized documents were eventually returned to him in 2008.
In January 2009, the Belgian judiciary on Tuesday definitively closed the case brought by the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF, in 2004 against Hans-Martin Tillack.
Aidan White, general secretary of the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) which supported Mr Tillack throughout the case, argued the need for EU officials to apologise to the journalist.

It was launched as a subsidiary of tour operator CT2 and began operations on 7 April 2004 with a long-haul flight to Cape Town using a Boeing 767-300ER aircraft. The company operated the 767 on a damp lease basis from Icelandair until their own Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) was granted from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Unfortunately, due to a lack of a bond, the AOC was revoked. A Boeing 757-200 aircraft was intended for use on short-haul flights to Mediterranean resorts, but due to the unsuccessful AOC application, the aircraft was only operated on a weekly check flight around Manchester.

[[Zinc–carbon battery]]

CATEGORIES: Battery types, Disposable batteries

A zinc–carbon battery (or "heavy duty") is a battery packaged in a zinc can that serves as both a container and negative terminal. It was developed from the wet Leclanché cell ([tpl]IPAc-en|l|ɛ|k|l|ɑː|n|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ[/tpl]). The positive terminal is a carbon rod surrounded by a mixture of manganese dioxide and carbon powder. The electrolyte used is a paste of zinc chloride and ammonium chloride dissolved in water. Zinc chloride cells are an improved version from the original ammonium chloride variety. Zinc–carbon batteries are the least expensive primary batteries and thus a popular choice by manufacturers when devices are sold with batteries included. They are commonly labeled as general purpose batteries, while Zinc chloride cells are often labeled "Heavy Duty". They were the first commercial dry battery and made flashlights and other portable devices possible, because the battery can function in any position. They can be used in low drain or intermittent devices such as remote controls, flashlights, clocks or transistor radios. They are replaced, in many usages, by alkaline cells, and rechargeable NiMH batteries.
Zinc-carbon batteries account for 20% of all portable batteries in the UK, and 18% in the EU, by volume.http://www.baj.or.jp/e/statistics/02.php Monthly battery sales statistics – MoETI – March 2011http://www.inobat.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf_09/Absatz_Statistik_2008.pdf INOBAT 2008 statistics.http://www.epbaeurope.net/090607_2006_Oct.pdf Battery Waste Management – 2006 DEFRAhttp://www.epbaeurope.net/documents/EPBASustainabilityreport2010_final.pdf EPBA Sustainability Report 2010 In Japan they account for only 6% of all primary battery sales, and only 7% of all types of batteries sold in Switzerland.

Michał Kalecki ([tpl]IPAc-pl|'|m|i|h|a|U|-|k|a|'|l|e|c|k|i[/tpl]; 22 June 1899 – 18 April 1970) was  a Polish economist who specialized in macroeconomics of a broadly-defined Keynesian sort. Over the course of his life, Kalecki worked at the London School of Economics, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and Warsaw School of Economics as well as an economic advisor to governments of Cuba, Israel, Mexico and India. He also served as the deputy director of the United Nations Economic Department in New York City.
Kalecki has been called "one of the most distinguished economists of the 20th century." It is often claimed that he developed many of the same ideas as Keynes, before Keynes; however, since he published in Polish and French, he remains much less known to the English-speaking world. He offered a synthesis that integrated Marxist class analysis and the then-new literature on oligopoly theory, and his work had a significant influence on both Neo-Marxian (Monopoly Capital) and Post Keynesian schools of economic thought. He was also one of the first macroeconomists to apply mathematical models and statistical data to economic questions.
In 1970, Michał Kalecki was nominated to the Nobel Prize in Economics, but died the same year.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nbs.sk/_img/Documents/BIATEC/BIA10_05/21_25.pdf|title=PROFILES OF WORLD ECONOMISTS: MICHAL KALECKI|author=Ivan Figura|journal=BIATEC – odborný bankový časopis|volume=XIII|date=October 2005|pages=21–25[/tpl]

The Olcott Park Greenhouse 4,500 square feet (420 m²) is a city-operated greenhouse located in the 40 acre (162,000 m²) Olcott Park at N 9th Avenue W and 7th Street N in Virginia, Minnesota. It is open to the public year-round without charge.
Olcott Park was named after W. J. Olcott, an officer of the Great Northern Mining Company. The company first leased the land to the city in 1905 for $1 per year if the city would pay taxes. In 1939 the city purchased the land for $9,015.
This three-room greenhouse dates from the 1930s. Its central room contains a good collection of exotic plants, ranging in size from small specimens to mature Ponderosa lemon trees bearing fruit, with cacti and succulents, large agave, palm, and ficus specimens. Historically, it was the site for huge begonia shows which attracted thousands of visitors. The north and south greenhouses were used to raise bedding plants for flower beds throughout the city.

The red lionfish (Pterois volitans) is a venomous, coral reef fish in the family Scorpaenidae, order Scorpaeniformes. P. volitans is natively found in the Indo-Pacific region, but has become an invasive problem in the Caribbean Sea, as well as along the East Coast of the United States. This and a similar species, Pterois miles have both been deemed as invasive species. Red lionfish are clad in white stripes alternated with red/maroon/brown stripes. Adults in this species can grow as large as  47cm (18.5 inches)http://lionfish.co/biggest-lionfish/ in length, while juveniles are typically shorter than [tpl]convert|1|in|cm[/tpl].National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science "Have You Seen Me?" The average red lionfish lives for around 10 years.Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). (2011, January 19). Retrieved 4 May 2011 from (http://eol.org) As with many species within the Scopaenidae family, it has large, venomous spines that protrude from the body, similar to a mane, giving it the common name of the lionfish. The venomous spines make the fish inedible or deter most potential predators. Lionfish reproduce monthly and are able to quickly disperse during their larval stage for expansion of their invasive region. There are no definitive predators of the lionfish, and many organizations are promoting the harvest and consumption of lionfish in efforts to prevent further increases in the already high population densities.

[[Blepharoplasty]]
CATEGORIES: Oculoplastic surgery

Blepharoplasty (Greek: blepheron, “eyelid” + plassein “to form”) is the plastic surgery operation for correcting defects, deformities, and disfigurations of the eyelids; and for aesthetically modifying the eye region of the face. With the excision and the removal, or the repositioning (or both) of excess tissues, such as  skin and adipocyte fat, and the reinforcement of the corresponding muscle and tendon tissues, the blepharoplasty procedure resolves functional and cosmetic problems of the periorbita, which is the area from the eyebrow to the upper portion of the cheek.
The operative goals of a blepharoplastic procedure are the restoration of the correct functioning to the affected eyelid(s), and the restoration of the aesthetics of the eye-region of the face, which are achieved by eliminating excess skin from the eyelid(s), smoothing the underlying eye muscles, tightening the supporting structures, and resecting and re-draping the excess fat of the retroseptal area of the eye, in order to produce a smooth anatomic transition from the lower eyelid to the cheek.
In an eye surgery procedure, the usual correction or modification (or both) is of the upper and the lower eyelids, and of the surrounding tissues of the eyebrows, the upper nasal-bridge area, and the upper portions of the cheeks, which are achieved by modifying the periosteal coverings of the facial bones that form the orbit (eye socket). The periosteum comprises two-layer connective tissues that cover the bones of the human body: (i) the external layer of networks of dense, connective tissues with blood vessels, and (ii) the internal, deep layer of collagenous bundles composed of spindle-shaped cells of connective tissue, and a network of thin, elastic fibres.

The International Larix Arboretum is a small arboretum of [tpl]convert|1.2|acre|m2[/tpl] dedicated to the scientific study of the larch (Larix) species. It is located within the Coram Experimental Forest, 30 yards SE of the Hungry Horse Ranger station at 10 Hungry Horse Drive Hungry Horse, Montana. The Arboretum is open to the public, without charge, during daylight hours from April to October.
Coram Experimental Forest was established in 1933 on the Flathead National Forest as an area representative of the Western Larch (Larix occidentalis).  While quite similar in appearance to other members of the pine tree family (pinaceae), the larch is not an evergreen.  It is deciduous and its needle-like leaves turn yellow and are shed in the autumn.  In addition, its wood is water resistant and thus used for fence posts, boat building, and exterior cladding.
The Arboretum was dedicated on October 7, 1992 as part of an International Larix Symposium to provide opportunities for species comparisons and genetics research. Species from North America, Asia, and Europe were planted, along with subspecies and hybrids. The Arboretum is organized as three equal-sized blocks, each about 70 by 230 feet (21 by 70 m), with 12 trees of each species, subspecies, and hybrids in each of the three blocks, for a total of nearly 600 trees.
The species planted are European Larch (Larix decidua), Dahurian Larch (Larix gmelinii), Japanese Larch (Larix kaempferi), Tamarack Larch (Larix laricina), Subalpine Larch (Larix lyallii), Masters' Larch (Larix mastersiana), Western Larch (Larix occidentalis), Chinese Larch (Larix potaninii), and Siberian Larch (Larix sibirica). Himalayan Larch (Larix griffithii) was also to be planted but seed could not be obtained. 
Hybrids planted include L. decidua x L. kaempferi (Larix x marschlinsii; Dunkeld Larch), L. lyallii x L. occidentalis (Bitterroot Larch), and L. occidentalis x L. lyallii (Bitterroot Larch, reverse cross).

[[Dysplasia]]

CATEGORIES: Oncology, Histopathology, Induced stem cells, Noninflammatory disorders of female genital tract

Dysplasia (from ancient Greek δυσ- dys-, "difficulty" + πλάσις plasis, "formation") is a term used in pathology to refer to an abnormality of development.[tpl]DorlandsDict|three/000033210|dysplasia[/tpl] This generally consists of an expansion of immature cells (such as cells of the ectoderm),  with a corresponding decrease in the number and location of mature cells. Dysplasia is often indicative of an early neoplastic process. The term dysplasia is typically used when the cellular abnormality is restricted to the originating tissue, as in the case of an early, in-situ neoplasm. 
Dysplasia, in which cell maturation and differentiation are delayed, can be contrasted with metaplasia, in which cells of one mature, differentiated type are replaced by cells of another mature, differentiated type.
The terms hip dysplasia and fibrous dysplasia also refer to abnormal development, but at a more macroscopic level.

[[Majorat]]

CATEGORIES: Property law

Majorat is a French term for an arrangement giving the right of succession to a specific parcel of property associated with a title of nobility to a single heir, based on male primogeniture. A majorat (fideicommis) would be inherited by the oldest son, or if there was no son, the nearest relative. This law existed in some European countries and was designed to prevent the distribution of wealthy estates between many members of the family, thus weakening their position. Majorats were one of the factors easing the evolution of aristocracy.  The term is not used of English inheritances, where the concept was actually the norm, in the form of entails or fee tails. Majorats were specifically regulated by French law.  In France, it was a title of property, landed or funded, attached to a title instituted by Napoleon I and abolished 1848.William Burge gives a full account of the French laws between Napoleon and 1838 in his Commentaries on colonial and foreign laws: generally, and in their conflict with each other, and with the law of England, Volume 2, 1838, Saunders and Benning, 1838, online from google 
Often the title could not be inherited if the property did not pass to the same person.Burges, 207-208 Like English entails, the implications of majorats were often used in fiction to furnish complexity in plots; Balzac was especially interested in them.Butler, Ronnie, Balzac and the French Revolution, pp. 113-120, 1983, Taylor & Francis, ISBN 0389204064, 9780389204060, google books
In Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, majorat was known as ordynacja and was introduced in late 16th century by king Stefan Batory. A couple of Polish magnates' fortunes were based on ordynacja, namely those of the Radziwiłłs, Zamoyskis, Wielopolskis. Ordynacja was abolished by the agricultural reform in the People's Republic of Poland.
In Portugal it was called Morgado or Morgadio and one of the requirements to inherit a Morgado was to pass down the family name related to the Morgado. Women with no brothers could inherit a Morgado: in that case their children would inherit the mother's name. If the husband was also a Morgado, the children would inherit both names.  This led to a tradition of very long family names in the Portuguese nobility.
In Spain it was known as mayorazgo, and become a part of the Castilian law since 1505 (Leyes de Toro) until 1820.

The giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus), also known as the brindlebass, brown spotted cod, or bumblebee grouper, and as the Queensland groper in Australia, is the largest bony fish found in coral reefs, and the aquatic emblem of Queensland, Australia. It is found from near the surface to depths of [tpl]convert|100|m|abbr=on[/tpl] at reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region, with the exception of the Persian Gulf. It also enters estuaries.[tpl]FishBase species | genus = Epinephelus | species = lanceolatus | month = May | year = 2012[/tpl] It reaches up to [tpl]convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and [tpl]convert|400|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] in weight; there are unconfirmed reports of it growing much bigger, up to [tpl]convert|3.05|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|598|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Giant groupers feed on a variety of marine life, including small sharks and juvenile sea turtles. Due to overfishing, this species has declined drastically in many regions, and it is now considered Vulnerable by the IUCN.
The Queensland grouper has also been found to inhabit the fresh-water of the Brisbane River of Queensland, Australia.
This giant fish is similar to the Malabar grouper, and its colour changes with age.  The giant grouper has a large mouth and a rounded tail.  Juveniles have irregular black and yellow markings, while adults are green-grey to grey-brown with faint mottling, with numerous small black spots on the fins.

[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]

CATEGORIES: Films based on works by Miguel de Cervantes, Works based on Don Quixote

The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is an unfinished feature film project directed and co-written by Terry Gilliam, based on the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes.
Pre-production of the first attempt to make the film started in 1998, with a script written by Gilliam and Tony Grisoni. Gilliam's version contains big changes from the book; in particular, Sancho Panza would only have appeared very early on the film, before being replaced by Toby Grisoni, a twenty-first century marketing executive thrown back through time.
After Gilliam's team succeeded in obtaining a budget of $32.1 million without any American financing, the film began shooting in 2000, with Jean Rochefort as Quixote and Johnny Depp as Toby Grisoni, and Jeremy Thomas as producer. After a significant number of difficulties after only a few days, such as set and equipment destroyed by flooding, the departure of Rochefort due to illness, problems obtaining insurance for the production, and other financial difficulties, the production was suspended after some scenes with Rochefort and Depp had already been shot. The production was subsequently cancelled.
Gilliam has attempted unsuccessfully to relaunch production several times since 2005. He restarted preliminary work in 2008 with Robert Duvall as Quixote.http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/02/28/terry-gilliams-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-may-still-happen Depp was still attached to play Grisoni, but because of his tight schedule he had to leave the project and was replaced by Ewan McGregor. In 2010, Gilliam announced that the funding had collapsed.[tpl]cite web | author=Ian Mundell | title=Gilliam's 'Quixote' problems continue | publisher=Variety (online edition) | date=2010-09-05 | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118023740.html?categoryid=3216&cs=1 | accessdate=2010-09-06[/tpl]
The original production was the subject of the acclaimed documentary film Lost in La Mancha (2002), which was intended as a trailer depicting the making of the feature film, but after the failure of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote the footage was expanded into a full length film.

[[Frits Staal]]
CATEGORIES: 1930 births, 2012 deaths, Dutch Indologists, People from Amsterdam

Johan Frederik (Frits) Staal (November 3, 1930 – February 19, 2012) was Emeritus Professor of Philosophy and South & Southeast Asian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Staal specialized in the study of Vedic ritual and mantras, and the scientific exploration of ritual and mysticism. He was also a scholar of  Greek and Indian logic and philosophy and Sanskrit grammar.
Staal was born in Amsterdam, the son of the architect Jan Frederik Staal, and studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. He continued with Indian philosophy and Sanskrit at Madras and Banaras. Staal was Professor of General and Comparative Philosophy in Amsterdam, 1962–67. He became Professor of Philosophy and South Asian Languages at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1968, and he retired in 1991. 
Staal argued that the ancient Indian grammarians, especially Pāṇini, had completely mastered methods of linguistic theory not rediscovered again until the 1950s and the applications of modern mathematical logic to linguistics by Noam Chomsky. (Chomsky himself has said that the first generative grammar in the modern sense was Panini's grammar).An event in Kolkata, Frontline 
The early methods allowed the construction of discrete, potentially infinite generative systems. Remarkably, these early linguistic systems were codified orally, though writing was then used to develop them in some way. The formal basis for Panini's methods involved the use of "auxiliary" markers, rediscovered in the 1930s by the logician Emil Post.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kadvany, John|title=Positional Value and Linguistic Recursion|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|year=2007|pages=487–520|volume=35[/tpl] Post's rewrite systems are now a standard approach for the description of computer languages.  The ancient discoveries were motivated by the need to preserve exact Sanskrit pronunciation and expression given the primacy of language in ancient Indian thought. 
In 1975, a consortium of scholars, led by Staal, documented the twelve-day performance, in Panjal village, Kerala, of the Vedic Agnicayana ritual.  It was thought possible that this would be the last performance of the ritual, but it has since been revived.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2310591841.html | title=Kerala village hosts 4,000-year-old ritual for world peace | publisher=McClatchy-Tribune Information Services. HighBeam Research (subscription required) | work=Hindustan Times (New Delhi, India) | year=2011 | accessdate=October 22, 2012[/tpl]
In "Rules without Meaning" Staal controversially suggested that mantras "predate language in the development of man in a chronological sense".  He pointed out that there is evidence that ritual existed before language, and argued that syntax was influenced by ritual.
His more recent study was concerned with Greek and Vedic geometry.
He drew a parallel between geometry and linguistics, writing that, "Panini is the Indian Euclid."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article2914852.ece | title=Obituary: Indologist Frits Staal of Athirathram fame passes away | work=The Hindu | accessdate=October 21, 2012[/tpl] Staal's point is that Panini showed how to extend spoken Sanskrit to a formal metalanguage for the language itself.  
Frits Staal retired to Thailand, and died in Chiangmai, aged 81.

The Úrvalsdeild karla ([tpl]IPA-is|ˈurvalsˌteilt ˈkʰartla[/tpl], Men's Select Division) is the top tier of the Icelandic football pyramid.  Because of the harsh winters in Iceland, it is generally played in the spring and summer (May to September). It is run by the Football Association of Iceland (KSI) and currently comprises 12 clubs. At the end of the 2012-2013 European season, UEFA ranked the league 40th in Europe.UEFA Country Ranking 2009 Bert Kassies' site, accessed 12 February 2009 From 27 April 2009, the Úrvalsdeild have been known as Pepsi-deildin (Engl. "The Pepsi League") after KSÍ and Ölgerðin (the producers of Pepsi in Iceland) signed a three-year sponsorship contract.Pepsi-deildin í knattspyrnu 2009 KSÍ's official site, accessed 28 April 2009
The top division consists of 12 clubs. Each club faces every other club twice during the season, once at home and once away. At the end of each season, the bottom two clubs are automatically relegated to the second level of the Icelandic league system, the 1. deild karla (First Division), with the top two clubs of the First Division automatically promoted to the Úrvalsdeild.
For the first time in the competition's history, the 2008 season saw 12 teams compete in the premier division, a part of KSI's attempt to strengthen Icelandic football.
Therefore, only one team were relegated in the 2007 season and three clubs were promoted from the First Division.
KR hold the most titles, with 26. Valur is next with 20, and ÍA and Fram Reykjavík follow with 18 each. The current champions of Iceland are KR.

The Kelvin rises on watershed of Scotland on the moor south east of the village of Banton, east of Kilsyth - Photo.  At almost 22 miles (35 km) long, it initially flows south to Dullatur Bog where it falls into a man made trench and takes a ninety degree turn flowing west through Strathkelvin and along the northern boundary of the bog parallel with the Forth & Clyde Canal. Its first important (and considerably larger) confluence is with the Chantyclear Burn which originates from the ridge of Dullatur. It then continues its westward flow being joined by the often depleted (due to water being diverted to the canal) Shawend Burn to the west of Craigmarloch bridge. The next important tributary is the Garrel at a point south-east of Kilsyth south of Dumbreck Marsh. The Kelvin then passes through the large flood plain north of Twechar where is fed by the Dock Water, Queenzie Burn, the Cast Burn and the Board Burn before reaching Kirkintilloch at its confluence with the more substantial waters of the Glazert and Luggie, it then flows past Torrance, meanders through Balmore Haughs, to the south of Bardowie where it joins the Allander Water after which it takes a south-westerly direction towards Maryhill, Hillhead, through Kelvingrove Park before falling into the River Clyde at Yorkhill Basin in the city of Glasgow.

[[Polyandry in Tibet]]

CATEGORIES: Tibetan culture, Marriage, unions and partnerships in China, Polyandry

Polyandry is a form of polygamy whereby a woman has several husbands.  In Tibet those husbands are often brothers, which is why it is most commonly called "Fraternal Polyandry". Concern over the delicate question of which children are fathered by which brother falls on the wife alone. She may or may not say who the father is because she does not wish to create conflict in the family; she may also be unsure who the biological father is.  
Historically, the social system compelled marriage within a social class.
Initially, when the People's Republic of China annexed Tibet, political systems in many regions of Tibet remained unchanged. Then starting between 1959 and 1960 political reforms changed the land ownership and taxation systems.Childs (2003) p.429 Professor Melvyn Goldstein believed this had a direct impact on Tibet's traditional marriage system. With the change of the social stratification as a result of land ownership and taxation systems, the du-jung and the mi-bo lower classes were the first to avoid the intramarriages that characterized the older society.
However, as part of its population control measures, the Chinese government later forbade polygamous marriage altogether under family law. Even though it is currently illegal, after collective farming was phased out and the farmed land reverted in the form of long-term leases to individual families, polyandry in Tibet is de facto the norm in rural areas.

The Johan Cruijff Schaal ([tpl]Lang-en|Johan Cruyff Shield[/tpl]) is a football trophy in the Netherlands named after legendary Dutch football player Johan Cruyff, also often referred to as the Dutch Super Cup. The winner is decided in one match only, played by the winner of the national football league (the Eredivisie) and the winner of the national KNVB Cup.

Turbutt Wright (February 5, 1741– 1783) was an American planter and political leader from Queen Anne's County, Maryland.  He was a delegate for Maryland in the Continental Congress sessions of 1782.
Turbutt was born on his father's plantation of White Marsh near Centreville and lived there his entire life.  He became politically active when he was elected to Maryland's General Assembly in 1773.  He joined the revolutionary conventions that began to function as a government in 1775.
Wright was a delegate to Maryland's constitutional convention in 1776, and that same year was appointed to the colony's Committee of Safety for the Eastern Shore.  Under the new constitution he again served in the state general assembly in 1781 and 1782.

Kang Ryang-uk (강량욱, 1904–1983), also spelled Kang Lyanguk, was a North Korean Protestant Minister and Chairman of the Christian Federation of Korea during the 1950s.
Kang was the maternal uncle of North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung. In his early years he was a school teacher (one of his pupils was Kim Il Sung). In the 1940s he studied Theology at the Pyongyang University, and after he completed his study he became a minister.
Kang became one of the close advisers of Kim Il Sung shortly after his return from the Soviet Union in October 1945. In 1946 he became the Chairman of the Christian League, later called the Korean Christian Federation. This organisation was in close contact with the Communist Party. In 1949 all Protestant Ministers were forced to join Kang's Christian Federation.
In the late 1940s, Kang became deputy Chairman of the Choson Democratic Party (Korean Democratic Party), which was a close ally of the ruling Korean Workers' Party.
Kang later served as a deputy prime minister of North Korea and a secretary of the Supreme People's Assembly.
Kang's second son, Kang Yong-sop, later succeeded him as head of the Korean Christian Federation.[tpl]Cite web|url=https://www.pcusa.org/news/2012/1/23/north-korean-christian-leader-kang-young-sup-dies/|title=North Korean Christian leader Kang Young-sup dies|publisher=Presbyterian Church USA|accessdate=2014-03-24|date=2012-01-23[/tpl]

[[Remix album]]

CATEGORIES: Album types, Remix albums

A remix album is an album consisting mostly of remixes or re-recorded versions of a music artists' earlier released material.
One of the earliest remix albums was 1971's Aerial Pandemonium Ballet by Harry Nilsson, which was released by Nilsson after the successes of Everybody's Talkin and The Point!, after he decided that his older material had started to sound dated. One of the earliest remix albums in Jazz music had been John Coltrane's Infinity, which was released in 1972, and may have been one of the earliest posthumous remix albums for any artist in the music industry, as well as one of the earliest remix albums ever recorded in general, regardless of music category and despite the criticism it got for Coltrane's widow Alice changing the orchestral backgrounds and rhythm sections along with creating new solos for piano, organ, harp and timpani. Miles Davis, of whom Coltrane once performed with, also recorded his own remix album called Evolution of the Groove, and though it was also released as a posthumous album like Infinity, it had to wait until 2007. The best-selling remix album of all time is Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix by Michael Jackson released by MJJ Productions Inc in 1997. 
Sly & The Family Stone's 1979 release 10 Years Too Soon featured disco remixes of the 1960s Family Stone hits. Then, in 1982, Soft Cell's Non-stop Ecstatic Dancing, which contained the track "A Man Could Get Lost," notable as one of the precursors to house music, was released. A month after the Soft Cell album, The Human League's Love and Dancing was released, and just under a year later Imagination's Nightdubbing was released.
The format was later popularized by the Pet Shop Boys' 1986 release Disco, and then the bandwagon was jumped on further by popular artists such as Madonna with her 1987 EP You Can Dance and in 1990 by Paula Abdul's Shut Up and Dance. In 1991, Kraftwerk released the album 'The Mix' consisting of remixes of their earlier work.The Mix at Allmusic
Although they had existed for years, remix albums still eluded mainstream acceptance. That would all change in recent years with releases from many popular artists who have taken advantage of the format of the remix album (including Jennifer Lopez, whose 2002 remix album J to tha L-O!: The Remixes was the first remix album to ever debut at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart).Neil Strauss: 2002 – The Year That Pop Lost Popularity. The New York Times, 26 December 2002 British band Bloc Party have released remix albums for two of their three studio albums to date (Silent Alarm and Intimacy) which have the same track listing as the studio album, but the remix instead of the original (e.g. on "Intimacy Remixed", track 6 on the original is 'Signs' whist on the remix album track 6 is 'Signs (Armand Van Helden Remix)', etc.)
Also, one of better known remix albums is Linkin Park's Reanimation released in 2002. It contains remixes of their mega-successful debut album Hybrid Theory as well as remixes of some older songs and B-sides. It sold about 2 million copies world wide and was certified platinum by the RIAA.
In the world of reggae music, it is not uncommon for a whole album to be remixed in a dub style. Examples include UB40's Present Arms in Dub (remixed by the band), Massive Attack's No Protection (Protection remixed by the Mad Professor), and Gorillaz's Laika Come Home (remixed by the Space Monkeyz).
In Rap, 2Pac's Nu-Mixx Klazzics was the first of his two remix albums, and was released in 2003. A second remix album, Nu-Mixx Klazzics Vol.2 was released four years later. Both were not received very well by the artist's fans. Notorious B.I.G.'s Duets: The Final Chapter was also a remix album of his three original albums, and was released in 2004, the second to last record of unreleased music to be released from the artist. One of the earliest attempts at a rap remix album had been by Snoop Dogg in the mid-1990s, which became a future original album called Doggumentary, but Snoop decided to cancel it. The best-selling rap remix album is Linkin Park's Reanimation, released in 2002.
In the modern day music business, it is not uncommon for a remix album to be released in lieu of a re-release when an album's performance does not meet expectations. Rihanna's Rated R and Snoop Dogg's Malice N Wonderland will all see a remix album release following lackluster sales.[tpl]cn|date=June 2012[/tpl]

Buckley Condensed Matter Prize winners, Guggenheim Fellows

Robert Coleman Richardson (June 26, 1937 – February 19, 2013)Biography on the Nobel Foundation website was an American experimental physicist whose area of research included sub-millikelvin temperature studies of helium-3. Richardson, along with David Lee, as senior researchers, and then graduate student Douglas Osheroff, shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics for their 1972 discovery of the property of superfluidity in helium-3 atoms in the Cornell University Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics.
Richardson was born in Washington D.C. He went to high school at Washington-Lee in Arlington, Virginia. He later described Washington-Lee's biology and physics courses as "very old-fashioned" for the time. "The idea of 'advanced placement' had not yet been invented," he wrote in his Nobel Prize autobiography. He took his first calculus course when he was a sophomore in college.Chang, Kenneth. (2013, February 22). Robert C. Richardson, 75, Laureate in Physics, Dies. The New York Times, p B14.
Richardson attended Virginia Tech and received a B.S. in 1958 and a M.S. in 1960. He received his PhD from Duke University in 1965.
At the time of his death, he was the Floyd Newman Professor of Physics at Cornell University, although he no longer operated a laboratory. From 1998 to 2007 he served as Cornell's vice provost for research, and from 2007 to 2009 was senior science adviser to the president and provost. His past experimental work focused on using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to study the quantum properties of liquids and solids at extremely low temperatures.
Richardson was an Eagle Scout, and mentioned the scouting activities of his youth in the biography he submitted to the Nobel Foundation at the time of his award.

Baghdadi Jews, also known as Iraqi Jews, are Jewish emigrants from Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq, some of whom were merchant traders settled on trade routes, and some of whom fled religious persecution and formed immigrant communities in their new homelands. Baghdad and Iraq in general used to have one of the largest, if not the largest Jewish community in the Middle East and Central Asia, and these new immigrant communities also included Jews as part of the Persian and Mughal courtiers.http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl101.htm Records of Jewish tradesmen traveling from Baghdad can be found from the early 17th century, and around the mid-19th century a large portion of the community started immigrating to South and South-east Asia as well as to the west, creating new communities while preserving their unique traditions.

Morgan's Raid was a highly publicized incursion by Confederate cavalry into the Northern states of Indiana and Ohio during the American Civil War.  The raid took place from June 11–July 26, 1863, and is named for the commander of the Confederates, Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan.
For 46 days as they rode over [tpl]convert|1000|mi[/tpl], Morgan's Confederates covered a region from Tennessee to northern Ohio. The raid coincided with the Vicksburg Campaign and the Gettysburg Campaign, although it was not directly related to either campaign. However, it served to draw the attention of tens of thousands of Federal troops away from their normal duties and strike fear in the civilian population of several Northern states. Repeatedly thwarted in his attempts to return to the South by hastily positioned Union forces and state militia, Morgan eventually surrendered what was left of his command in northeastern Ohio. He escaped through Ohio, and casually took a train to Cincinnati, where he crossed the Ohio River. 
To many Southerners, the daring expedition behind enemy lines became known as The Great Raid of 1863, and was initially hailed in the newspapers. However, along with Gettysburg and Vicksburg, it was another in a string of defeats for the Confederate army that summer. Some Northern newspapers derisively labeled Morgan's expedition as The Calico Raid, in reference to the raiders' propensity for procuring personal goods from local stores and houses.

After the show, he was introduced to Bob Nanna through a mutual friend.  Broach was then introduced to Roy Ewing, the drummer of Braid, and spoke to him at length.  By the end of the show, Ewing was walking around introducing Broach to friends as 'the newest member of the band,' much to the surprise of Broach. A couple of tryouts later, and a line-up change in which Broach replaced Pete Havranek on guitar,  Broach became an official member of Braid, recording his guitar parts on the first 7-inch the band ever released a week later.Grubbs, 2008, p. 135-138

Southbranch Settlement was the name ascribed to a series of French Métis settlements on the Canadian prairies in the 19th Century, in what is today the province of Saskatchewan. Métis settlers began making homes here in the 1860s and 1870s, many of them fleeing economic and social dislocation from Red River, Manitoba.
The Settlements stretched along both sides of the South Saskatchewan River in river lot style from Fish Creek north through Batoche and St. Laurent to St. Louis which was its northern boundary. They included Duck Lake 12 kilometers from St. Laurent accessed by the St. Laurent Ferry. The distance from Fish Creek to St. Louis was less than 50 kilometres. They were proximal to several Cree reserves, as well as Anglo-Metis settlements to the north around Prince Albert.
Batoche and St. Laurent de Grandin were founded by French Métis hivernants from the Red River settlement. Hivernants were hunters and trappers who spent the winter on the prairies and returned to the Red River settlement in the spring with their winter catch.[tpl]cite book|author=John Welsted|title=The Geography of Manitoba: Its Land and Its People|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IQKLCbdJ0GQC&pg=PA89|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=978-0-88755-375-2|page=89[/tpl] 
Gabriel Dumont was the leader of the buffalo hunt for his group of 200 hunters living in the Southbranch settlements from 1863 to the end of the Métis buffalo hunts in about 1875.
In 1873 the Southbranch settlements organized a form of local government, under Gabriel Dumont, based on the laws of the buffalo hunt.
In the 1880s the population of the Southbranch settlements may have been as high as 1300 with 40 to 60 families living in each of the four largest communities.
The Northwest Rebellion of 1885 was a traumatic event for all the Southbranch communities, and they had passed their prime by the 1890s when the railway brought in increasing numbers of new immigrant settlers. Some of the settlements, such as St. Louis still remain however.

Eastgate and Eastgate Clock in Chester, Cheshire, England, stand on the site of the original entrance to the Roman fortress of Deva Victrix.  It is a prominent landmark in the city of Chester and is said to be the most photographed clock in England after Big Ben.
The original gate was guarded by a timber tower which was replaced by a stone tower in the 2nd century, and this in turn was replaced probably in the 14th century.  The present gateway dates from 1768 and is a three-arched sandstone structure which carries the walkway forming part of Chester city walls.  In 1899 a clock was added to the top of the gateway to celebrate the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria two years earlier.  It is carried on openwork iron pylons, has a clock face on all four sides, and a copper ogee cupola.  The clock was designed by the Chester architect John Douglas.  The whole structure, gateway and clock, was designated as a Grade I listed building on 28 July 1955.[tpl]NHLE |num= 1376249|desc= The Eastgate and Clock, Chester|accessdate= 15 July 2012[/tpl]

[[High chair]]

CATEGORIES: Babycare, Chairs, Infancy

A high chair is a piece of furniture used for feeding older babies and younger toddlers. The seat is raised a fair distance from the ground, so that a person of adult height may spoon-feed the child comfortably from a standing position (hence the name). It often has a wide base to increase stability. There is a tray which is attached to the arms of the high chair, which allows the adult to place the food on it for either the child to pick up and eat or for the food to be spoon-fed to them.  High chairs typically have seat belts to strap the child in.
A booster chair is meant to be used with a regular chair to boost the height of a child sufficiently.  Some boosters are a simple monolithic piece of plastic.  Others are more complex and are designed to fold up and include a detachable tray.
Rarely, a chair can be suspended from the edge of the table avoiding the need for an adult chair or a high chair.

Starka is a traditional dry vodka distilled from rye grain, currently produced only in Poland. A Starka-flavoured vodka is also produced in Lithuania. Traditional Starka is made from natural (up to 2 distillations, no rectification) rye spirit and aged in oak barrels with small addition of lime-tree and apple-tree leaves. The process of production is similar to that used in whisky. Sold in various varieties, the most notable difference between them is the length of aging period, varying from 5 to over 50 years, and the natural colour which is taken from the long reaction between alcohol and the oak, not from the addings.

Opisthorchis viverrini, common name Southeast Asian liver fluke, is a trematode parasite from the family Opisthorchiidae that attacks the area of the bile duct.

Opisthorchis viverrini infection also predisposes the infected for cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the gall bladder and/or its ducts.

[tpl]Campaignbox Morgan's Raid in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio[/tpl]
The Battle of Corydon was a minor engagement that took place July 9, 1863, just south of Corydon, which had been the original capital of Indiana until 1825, and was the county seat of Harrison County. The attack occurred during Morgan's Raid in the American Civil War as a force of 2,500 cavalry invaded the North in support of the Tullahoma Campaign. It was the only pitched battle of the Civil War that occurred in Indiana, and no battle has occurred within Indiana since.Stephen Rockenbach, "'This Just Hope of Ultimate Payment,'" Indiana Magazine of History (2013) 109#1 pp 45-60.
As news of an impending raid spread across the state, Governor Oliver P. Morton called out the state's militia force, the Indiana Legion, to defend against the threat. Unaware of the size of the invading army, four companies of the 6th and 8th Regiments of the Legion, totaling about one hundred men, attempted to prevent the Confederates from crossing the Ohio River into Indiana, but were overcome by superior artillery fire, killing two of the defenders. The units retreated northward where they met with the main body of the 6th Regiment under the command of Col. Lewis Jordan. Along with the townspeople, they constructed breastworks that formed a defensive line south of Corydon. Despite promises of reinforcements from regional Legion commanders in New Albany, only about 450 men (consisting almost entirely of locals) were defending the town.
As the raiders approached from the south, the advance elements formed a battle line and launched a frontal attack and an unsuccessful flanking movement against the east side of the Legion's works. Reinforcements and artillery soon arrived with the main body of Confederate troops, giving the attackers a strong numerical superiority. With the support of the artillery, a pincer movement caused the Legion to abandon their position to avoid being surrounded. A large part of the Legion were captured as they attempted to escape from the town, while Col. Jordon and others regrouped downtown. Confederates then seized the Legion's commissary supplies on the edge of town, and fired two warning shots into the downtown from their artillery, convincing Jordan that continued resistance was futile and leading him to surrender his force and Corydon. Although the short battle cost the cavalry twice as many casualties as the outnumbered militia units, the battle resulted in a Confederate victory, which enabled Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan to secure supplies and money before continuing his raid through Indiana and into Ohio. The delay, however, proved critical in helping the pursuing Union army overtake and later capture Morgan and his forces.

It is an art of engagement – engagement for change."John Green, from the Introduction to Ken Sprague – People's Artist Martin Rowson said "Ken's art has the power and strength to inspire.

[[Andrijica Šimić]]
CATEGORIES: 1833 births, 1905 deaths, People from Grude, Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatian outlaws, Bosnia and Herzegovina criminals, Date of birth unknown

Andrijica Šimić (1833 – 5 February 1905) was a hajduk from Herzegovina.
Andrija Šimić (Andrijica is a diminutive form) was born in Grude, into an ethnic Croats family of seven children: he had a brother and five sisters. At the age of ten, he moved to Mostar to work for the Ottoman aga Tikvina as a wage worker. He worked there until the age of 20, when he returned to his village.
The Ottoman Turkish taxmen harassed the local population, and at one point robbed his father at gunpoint. Andrijica was enraged and decided to become a hajduk, an outlaw, to fight the Turkish government. He was hunted down and imprisoned on several occasions, as he also pillaged and stole from Muslim and Christian wealthy men in the region. His robberies affected not only Ottoman but also Austro-Hungarian territory in inner Dalmatia, so even the Austrian authorities put a warrant for the arrest of him and his group.
He was joined by other young men and evaded the authorities for six years. They aimed to be outlaws in a manner similar to Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor peasants.
The group was pursued by the Austro-Hungarian authorities, and at one point in the village of Zagvozd he shot and killed a member of the police while trying to escape. He fled to the village of Runovići where he found shelter at the Garac family. However, Ante Garac and his wife Kata together with six other villagers tied him up in his sleep and handed him over to the authorities.
When he was finally tried in 1871, they sentenced him to life in prison. He served 33 years in the Koper jail when he was paroled at the age of 68 due to efforts of his stepson Jozo who was a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army.
When Andrijica returned to Dalmatia, the citizens of Split celebrated it with three days of festivities and gave him plentiful donations. He decided to travel throughout Dalmatia, telling stories about his escapades to many people on the road.
One day he wandered back into the once fatal village of Runovići, and died there. When he died all the money they found in his pocket was one crown and two para.
Ivan Mimica Zunkalo (1862–1945) served his sentence in prison together with Šimić, and during this time composed 3616 ten-syllable verses of epic poetry which he published in 1892. Šimić was later topic to several other epic songs, lyrical verses, dramas and novels, as well as a 1995 documentary by Croatian Radiotelevision.
The local government in Imotski decided to erect a monument at his grave in Runovići in 1991. The sculpture was cast by the Split artist Ante Strinić.

Son of Frankenstein (1939) is a horror monster film and is the third film in Universal Studios' Frankenstein series and the last to feature Boris Karloff as the Monster as well as the first to feature Bela Lugosi as Ygor. The picture is a sequel to James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein directed by Rowland V. Lee and starring Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff and Béla Lugosi.
The film was a reaction to the very popular re-releases of Dracula with Lugosi and Frankenstein with Karloff as a double-feature in 1938."Revival of the Undead", New York Times, October 16, 1938, p. 160. Universal's declining horror output was revitalized with the enormously successful Son of Frankenstein, in which the studio cast both Karloff and Lugosi.

Saran is the trade name for a number of polymers made from vinylidene chloride (especially polyvinylidene chloride or PVDC), along with other monomers.  Since its accidental discovery in 1933, Saran has been used for a number of commercial and industrial products.  When formed into a thin plastic film, the principal advantage of Saran, when compared to other plastics, is its very low permeability to water vapor, flavor and aroma molecules, and oxygen. This oxygen barrier retards food spoilage, while the film barrier to flavor and aroma molecules helps food retain its flavor and aroma.

[[List of West Indies cricket captains]]

CATEGORIES: West Indian cricket captains, Lists of West Indies cricketers, Lists of cricket captains, West Indies in international cricket

This is a list of all men, boys and women who have captained the West Indian cricket team at official international level in at least one match. The West Indies became a full member of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now the International Cricket Council) on 31 May 1926 at the same time as India and New Zealand were made up to full membership and played its first Test match in 1928 against England at Lord's. Their first game against other opposition came in 1930/31 when they played Australia.
The West Indian team's greatest successes in One Day Internationals came in 1975 and 1979, when they won the Cricket World Cup under the captaincy of Clive Lloyd, and in 2004 when they won the ICC Champions Trophy under the captaincy of Brian Lara. The West Indies’ most successful captains in Test cricket are Viv Richards (who has won 27 of his 50 Tests), Clive Lloyd (who won 36 of his 74 Tests), Frank Worrell (who won 9 of his 15 Tests) and Richie Richardson (who won 11 of his 24 Tests). In one-day internationals the West Indies’ most successful captain is Clive Lloyd, who won 64 of his 84 matches. For the most recent international format of cricket, Twenty20 Internationals, the West Indies' best result in an international tournament was achieved in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 where the team won the ICC World Twenty20 under the captaincy of Darren Sammy. Merissa Aguilleira led West Indies women to the semi-finals in the 2010 ICC Women's World Twenty20, the 2012 ICC Women's World Twenty20 and the 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 and also led the women to their first title in an international Women's Twenty20 tournament during the 2010 ICC Women's Cricket Challenge. Both the West Indies' men's and women's teams made it to the semi-finals of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC Women's World Twenty20 under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Merissa Aguilleira respectively; the third time the men's and women's teams from the same country have done this in the ICC World Twenty20 after Australia's men and women's teams achieved the feat in 2010 and 2012. This feat was repeated for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 when the West Indies' men's and women's teams made it to the semi-finals again under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Merissa Aguillera. Along with South Africa's men and women's teams who also made it the semi-finals in the 2014 tournaments, this was the fifth time men's and women's teams from the same country have reached the semi-finals in the same year of the ICC World Twenty20. Aguilleira also led the West Indies women to its best result in Women's ODI cricket when the team finished second in the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup (bettering their previous best finish in the Women's World Cup of fifth place in 2005). Their previous best result had been under Stephanie Power when she led the West Indies to second place in the 2003 International Women's Cricket Council Trophy. Aguilleira is also the most successful West Indies women’s captain in one-day internationals, winning 32 of 55 matches. The only women’s captain who has led her side to a victory in a women's Test match is Louise Brown in the 1976/77 Test series against India. In the mid-1980s there were two rebel West Indian tours to South Africa, which was at that time banned from official competition because of the apartheid régime then in force there. None of the matches from the rebel tours were recognised as official Test matches and all players who toured South Africa at the time were banned from official international cricket matches for life. The captains of those West Indian sides are also listed below.

The West Indies also toured England in 1900, 1906 and 1923 with the opposition usually being various English first-class and minor county sides. Other opposition during these tours included amateur sides, the MCC, an England XI (once) and Scotland and Ireland (once each). Some of the matches played on the various West Indian tours of England were deemed not to be first-class matches. During this time (1897 to 1926) the various West Indies captains were Aucher Warner, Stanley Sproston (non-first-class matches only), Harold Austin, Clement King, Alfred Harrigan, Edwin Moulder, William Sherlock, Percy Tarilton, Malcolm Austin and Karl Nunes

In the episode, Grampa confesses that Homer has a half-brother, whom Homer immediately tries to track down. He eventually discovers that his brother is Herbert Powell, the head of a car manufacturer. Herb immediately starts to bond with Bart and Lisa, and he invites Homer to design his own car. Homer's car design turns out to be a disaster, which causes Herb to become bankrupt.
The episode was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Wes Archer. American actor Danny DeVito provided the voice of Herb. The episode features cultural references to cars such as the Edsel, the Tucker Torpedo, the Ford Mustang, and the Lamborghini Cheetah. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.4, and was the highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. Some fans were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to write a sequel, "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?", in which Herb regains his fortune and forgives Homer.

[[Acanthocheilonema viteae]]
CATEGORIES: Spirurida, Parasitic nematodes

Description
Acanthocheilonema viteae is a parasitic nematode.
Acanthocheilonema viteae, previously Dipetalonema viteae,  is a rodent filarial worm that is often used as a model to study human filarial infections. Filarial nematodes are the causative agents of filariases, tropical diseases that afflict about 160 million people worldwide. Currently, there are neither safe and efficient drugs nor vaccines available to eliminate or prevent these infections, which makes the development of new control strategies a priority (Tachu et al., 2008).
Acanthocheilonema viteae is an animal parasite.  These filarial nematodes and their animal hosts are often used as models for studies on the biology of human infection.  Acanthocheilonema viteae shares considerable antigenic homology with the human filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus; this allows for rapid analysis of larval development which is essential to efforts in vaccine development (Eisenbeiss et al., 1991).
Research
Acanthocheilonema viteae is one of the few filaroids that do not bear Wolbachia bacteria. Infection with Wolbachia is essential to the continued good health and reproduction of their nematode hosts. Molecular studies suggest that Acanthocheilonema viteae either lost their symbionts before they became essential or diverged from other filaroids before Wolbachia acquisition (Schmidt and Roberts, 2009).

[[Leone Levi]]

CATEGORIES: 1821 births, 1888 deaths, British economists, British Jews, Italian Jews, Jewish scientists, Academics of King's College London

Leone Levi (June 6, 1821 – May 7, 1888) was an English jurist and statistician.
Born to a Jewish family in Ancona, Italy, he worked in commerce there before emigrating to Liverpool in 1844. There he obtained British citizenship and joined the Presbyterian church.
At the time, English law regarding the establishment of local chambers of commerce was highly unsystematic and wanting. He therefore advocated their institution in numerous pamphlets, leading to the establishment of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce in 1849, with Levi as its secretary. In 1850 he published his Commercial Law of the World, an exhaustive comparative treatise upon the laws and codes of mercantile countries. Appointed in 1852 to the chair of commercial law at King's College London, he was a popular instructor who innovated evening classes.
Levi was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1859, and a doctorate in political science from the University of Tübingen. His chief work, History of British Commerce and of the Economic Progress of the British Nation, 1763-1870, is considered to be a partisan account of British economic development, but its value as a work of reference cannot be gainsaid.

[[Ionomer]]
CATEGORIES: Plastics, Polyelectrolytes, Copolymers, Salts, Thermoplastics

An ionomer ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|ˈ|ɑː|n|ə|m|ər[/tpl]) is a polymer that comprises repeat units of both electrically neutral repeating units and a fraction of ionized units (usually no more than 15 mole percent) covalently bonded to the polymer backbone as pendant moieties. This means that most ionomers are copolymers of the neutral segments and the ionized units, which usually consist of carboxylic acid groups.
The classification of a polymer as an ionomer depends on the level of substitution of ionic groups as well as how the ionic groups are incorporated into the polymer structure. For example, polyelectrolytes also have ionic groups covalently bonded to the polymer backbone but have a much higher ionic group molar substitution level (usually greater than 80%); ionenes are polymers where ionic groups are part of the actual polymer backbone. These two classes of ionic-group-containing polymers have vastly different morphological and physical properties and are therefore not considered ionomers. Ionomers have unique physical properties including electrical conductivity and isoviscosity -- increase in ionomer solution viscosity with increasing temperatures (see conducting polymer). Ionomers also have unique morphological properties as the non-polar polymer backbone is energetically incompatible with the polar ionic groups. As a result, the ionic groups will microphase separate into ionic-rich domains in most ionomers.
Some commercial applications for ionomers are golf ball covers, semipermeable membranes, sealing tape and thermoplastic elastomers.
Common examples include polystyrene sulfonate, Nafion and Hycar.

[[Disk Utility]]
CATEGORIES: OS X, Disk partitioning software, Hard disk software, Data erasure, Backup software for OS X, OS X archivers and compression-related utilities

Disk Utility is an Apple Mac OS X operating system utility for performing disk and disk volume-related tasks.
The functions supported by Disk Utility include:"Disk Utility 10.5 Help: Testing and repairing a disk or volume". Apple Inc.
Disk Utility functions may also be accessed from the Mac OS X command line with the diskutil and hdiutil commands.
Disk Utility was updated with Mac OS X v10.3. Prior to v10.3, the functionality of Disk Utility was spread across two applications: Disk Copy and Disk Utility. Disk Copy was used for creating and mounting disk image files, and Disk Utility was used for formatting, partitioning, verifying and repairing file structures. The ability to "zero" all data on a disk was not added until Mac OS X 10.2.3"Mac OS X: About the Mac OS X 10.2.3 Update". Apple Inc.
Further changes introduced in 10.4.3 allowed Disk Utility to be used to verify the file structure of the current boot drive. However, as Apple notes in their public knowledge base,"Using Disk Utility in Mac OS X 10.4.3 or later to verify or repair disks". Apple Inc. doing so can sometimes yield false error messages.
Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard added the ability to create, resize, and delete disk partitions without erasing them, a feature known as live partitioning.
In versions of the Mac OS prior to Mac OS X, similar functionality to the verification features of Disk Utility could be found in the Disk First Aid application. Another application called Drive Setup was used for drive formatting and partitioning, and the application Disk Copy was used for working with disk images.

[[Pontine nuclei]]
CATEGORIES: Pons

The pontine nuclei (or griseum pontis) are a part of the pons involved in motor activity. Corticopontine fibres carry information from the primary motor cortex to the ipsilateral pontine nucleus in the ventral pons, and the pontocerebellar projection then carries that information to the contralateral cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncle. Extension of these nuclei in the medulla oblongata are named arcuate nucleus (medulla) which has the same function.
They therefore allow modification of actions in the light of their outcome, or error correction, and are hence important in learning motor skills.

A Connecticut Yankee is a musical based on the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by American writer Mark Twain. Like most adaptations of the Twain novel, it focuses on the lighter aspects of the story. The music was written by Richard Rodgers, the lyrics by Lorenz Hart, and the book by Herbert Fields. It was produced by Lew Fields and Lyle D. Andrews. It enjoyed an original run on Broadway in 1927 of 421 performances and a number of revivals.
The 1931 film of the same name starring Will Rogers was not adapted from this musical, nor was the 1949 musical film A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which starred Bing Crosby. The Rodgers and Hart Connecticut Yankee, like many of the team's earlier musicals, has never been filmed for the big screen though a scene was staged for the 1948 biographical movie of the life of Richard Rodgers,  Words and Music.

How the annexins are transported out of the cell into the blood is a mystery because they lack a signal peptide necessary for proteins to be transported out of the cell.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]

Louis Antoine François Baillon (January 20, 1778 – December 3, 1855) was a French naturalist and collector.  He was born in Montreuil-sur-Mer and died in Abbeville.
His father, Jean-François-Emmanuel Baillon (1742-1802), a lawyer and correspondent of the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, introduced him to natural history. In 1798, Baillon began work at as an assistant at the Jardin des Plantes, a position he relinquished following the death of his father. Afterwards, he settled in Abbeville, and like his father, became known for his correspondence with famed naturalists that included Franco Andrea Bonelli, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied.Musée George-Sand et de la Vallée noire Collections ornithologiques 
During his career, he continued and developed an ornithological collection that was initiated by his father, a collection that eventually grew to 6000 items. Baillon's collection is now conserved in "Musée George-Sand
et de la Vallée noire" in La Châtre. In addition to birds from France, it contains exotic specimens from French voyages of exploration, notably birds from the expeditions of Jacques Labillardière and Jules Dumont d'Urville. He is particularly noted for his Cetacea skeletons [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] and was the author of a monograph on the fauna of Abbeville, Catalogue des mammifères, oiseaux, reptiles, poissons et mollusques testacés marins observés dans l'arrondissement d'Abbeville.Google Books Catalogue des mammifères, oiseaux, etc.

Spermine is a polyamine involved in cellular metabolism found in all eukaryotic cells.  Formed from spermidine, it is found in a wide variety of organisms and tissues and is an essential growth factor in some bacteria. It is found as a polycation at physiological pH. Spermine is associated with nucleic acids and is thought to stabilize helical structure, in particular, in viruses.
Crystals of spermine phosphate were first described in 1678, in human semen, by Anton van Leeuwenhoek.Leeuwenhoek, A. van (1678) Observationes D. Anthonii Leeuwenhoek, de natis e semine genitali animalculis. Letter dated November 1677. Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London, 12,1040-1043.

Demining or mine clearance is the process of removing either land mines, or naval mines, from an area, while minesweeping describes the act of detecting of mines. There are two distinct types of mine detection and removal: military and humanitarian.
Minesweepers use many tools in order to accomplish their task. Tools have historically included many trained animals, including dogs and rats, but most often in the modern world minesweepers rely on metal detectors or vehicles with a wide variety of mechanical tools attached to them. There also are or have been other methods developed to detect mines, including the use of trained marine mammals, bacteria, acoustics, and other more exotic methods.

{{Blacklisted-links|1=
The Multia, later re-branded the Universal Desktop Box, was a line of desktop computers introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation on 7 November 1994.  The line is notable in that units were offered with either an Alpha AXP or Intel Pentium processor as the CPU, and most hardware other than the backplane and CPU were interchangeable.  Both the Alpha and Intel versions were intended to run Windows NT.
The Multia had a compact case that left little room for expansion cards and restricted air flow, which can cause premature hardware failure due to overheating if not properly cared for. Enthusiasts remedy this by placing the Multia vertically instead of horizontally, allowing the heated air to escape via vents at the top, although this still requires preventing the Multia from overheating due to other factors, e.g. environmental.

[[Imagesetter]]
CATEGORIES: Print production, Computer printers

An imagesetter is an ultra-high resolution large-format computer output device. It exposes rolls or sheets of either photographic film or bromide paper to a laser light source.  Once the film or paper is developed, a very high quality black and white image is revealed.  Development (processing) usually occurs in a unit separate to the imagesetter, as does raster image processing.
Imagesetter setter output ranges in width, usually [tpl]convert|12|to|44|in[/tpl].  The resolution of an imagesetter is typically between 1200 and 4800 dpi.
The imagesetter has been largely superseded by the platesetter.
Imagesetter film is a silver halide-coated plastic film very similar to normal black & white photographic film, except the spectral sensitivity is reduced to a much narrower band around the output of the laser of the individual imagesetter.  This allows the film to be handled under a (usually red) safelight, instead of in total darkness like most photographic film.

The brothers presented illusions that they and others claimed to be supernatural.
The Davenports began in 1854, less than a decade after Spiritualism had taken off in America.  After stories of the Fox sisters, the Davenports started reporting similar occurrences.  Their father took up managing his sons and the group was joined by William Fay, a Buffalo resident with an interest in conjuring.  Their shows were introduced by a former "Restoration Movement" minister, Dr. J. B. Ferguson, a follower of Spiritualism, who assured the audience that the brothers worked by spirit power rather than deceptive trickery. Ferguson was apparently sincere that the Davenports possessed spiritual powers.
The Davenports' most famous effect was the box illusion.  The brothers were tied inside a box which contained musical instruments.  Once the box was closed, the instruments would sound.  Upon opening the box, the brothers were tied in the positions in which they had started the illusion. Those who witnessed the effect were made to believe supernatural forces had caused the trick to work.
The Davenports toured the United States for 10 years and then traveled to England where spiritualism was beginning to become popular.  Their "spirit cabinet" was investigated by the Ghost Club, who were challenging their claim of being able to contact the dead.http://www.prairieghosts.com/ghostclub.html  The result of the Ghost Club's investigation was never made public.  In 1868 the team was joined by Harry Kellar.  Kellar and Fay eventually would leave the group to pursue their own career as a magician team.
Magicians including John Henry Anderson and Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin worked to expose the Davenport Brothers, writing exposés and performing duplicate effects.  A pair of amateur magicians followed the brothers around Britain, tying the Davenports into their box with a knot that could not be easily removed and thus exposed the trick to audiences who demanded their money back.  The impresario P. T. Barnum included an exposé of the Davenports in his 1865 book The Humbugs of the World.
The Davenports were rejoined by William Fay for a final American tour before William Henry's death in 1877.  Fay settled in Australia and Ira Erastus lived in America until the two reunited in 1895 and toured with a show that failed.
Ira told escape artist Harry Houdini, a skeptic of Spiritualism, that he and his brother had never confirmed belief in Spiritualism to their audiences and that announcements by Dr. Ferguson were part of the act.  Houdini made clear to audiences that his escapes were feats of skill, not supernatural, and that performances by others were likewise, regardless of claims to the contrary.

[[Accounting equation]]
CATEGORIES: Accounting terminology

The basic accounting equation, also called the balance sheet equation, represents the relationship between the assets, liabilities, and owner's equity of a business.  It is the foundation for the double-entry bookkeeping system. For each transaction, the total debits equal the total credits. It can be expressed as
In a corporation, capital represents the stockholders' equity. Since every business transaction affects at least two of a company’s accounts, the accounting equation will always be “in balance,” meaning the left side should always equal the right side. Thus, the accounting formula essentially shows that what the firm owns (its assets) is purchased by either what it owes (its liabilities) or by what its owners invest (its shareholders equity or capital).

English-speaking Quebecers (also known as Anglo-Quebecers, English Quebecers, or Anglophone Quebecers, all with the optional spelling Quebeckers; in French Anglo-Québécois, Québécois Anglophone, or simply Anglo) refers to the English-speaking (anglophone) minority of the primarily French-speaking (francophone) province of Quebec, Canada.  The English-speaking community in Quebec constitutes an official linguistic minority population under Canadian law.[tpl]cite web| author= Department of justice Canada  |publisher= Department of Justice Canada  |title=  Constitutuion Acts 1867 to 1982 |accessdate=2006-11-16 |url= http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html#education[/tpl]
English-speaking Quebeckers are not one but many ethnic groups, with large emigration with Canadian provinces, an early and strong English language education program in Quebec schools, and waves of international immigration.  This makes estimating the population difficult. According to the 2011 Canadian census, 599,225 (7.7% of population, including 4% Italian Canadian) in Quebec declare English as a mother tongue.
More ambiguous are the 834,950 (10.7%) that use mostly English as their home language, and 1,058,250 (13.5%) that comprise the Canadian Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official Canadian language spoken.

Safwan ibn Umayyah ([tpl]lang-ar|صفوان بن أمية[/tpl]) (died 661) was a sahaba (companion) of Muhammad from the Banu Jumah clan of the Quraish tribe. He is the son of Umayah ibn Khalaf, one of the leaders of Quraish.
He was married to Najiyah bint al-Walid ibn al-Mughira, the daughter of Walid ibn Mughira
Abu Fakih was a slave of Safwan ibn Umayya. Abu Fakih accepted Islam, and when Safwan came to know that Abu Fakih had become a Muslim, he subjected him to great torture. When Abu Bakr came to know of the pitiable condition of Abu Fakih, he purchased him from his master and set him free.
Safwan ibn Umayyah also participated in the battle of Badr where his father died and he fled.
He conspired with Umayr ibn Wahb to kill Muhammad.
Safwan's paternal cousin was Wahb ibn Umayr, the son of Umayr ibn Wahb.
Safwan's wife, Najiyah, converted to Islam before her husband, after the conquest of Makka. Safwan ibn Umayya fled, but Muhammed sent Wahb ibn Umayr after him, with Muhammed's cloak as token of safe-conduct. Safwan returned and became friends with Muhammed, although he did not convert to Islam until after the battles of Hunayn and at-Ta'if. (Al Muwatta Hadith 28.44)

The studio album mostly consisted of newly written, self-penned material, including a number of songs that had been composed by band leader Roger McGuinn and Broadway theatre director Jacques Levy for a planned country rock musical that the pair were developing.  The production was to have been based on Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt and staged under the title of Gene Tryp (an anagram of Ibsen's play), with the narrative taking place in the south-west of America during the mid-19th century.[tpl]cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=200|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0[/tpl]  However, plans for the musical fell through and five of the songs that had been intended for Gene Tryp were instead recorded by The Byrds for (Untitled)—although only four appeared in the album's final running order.
The album peaked at #40 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and reached #11 on the UK Albums Chart.[tpl]cite web|title=The Byrds Billboard Albums|publisher=Allmusic|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3810/charts-awards|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Brown, Tony.|page=130|year=2000|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-7670-8[/tpl]  A single taken from the album, "Chestnut Mare" b/w "Just a Season", was released in the U.S. in October 1970 but missed the Billboard Hot 100 chart, bubbling under at #121.[tpl]cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=253–257|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0[/tpl]  The single was later released in the UK in January 1971, where it did considerably better, reaching #19 on the UK Singles Chart.  Upon release, (Untitled) was met with positive reviews and strong sales, with many critics and fans regarding the album as a return to form for the band.

[[Direct fluorescent antibody]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory techniques, Clinical pathology, Immunologic tests

A direct fluorescent antibody (DFA or dFA) (also known as "Direct immunofluorescence"[tpl]cite book |author=Pober, Jordan S.; Abbas, Abul K.; Lichtman, Andrew H. |title=Cellular and molecular immunology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-8233-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]) is an antibody that has been tagged in a direct fluorescent antibody test. Its name derives from the fact that it directly tests the presence of an antigen with the tagged antibody, unlike western blotting, which uses an indirect method of detection, where the primary antibody binds the target antigen, with a secondary antibody directed against the primary, and a tag attached to the secondary antibody. 
Commercial DFA testing kits are available, which contain fluorescently labelled antibodies, designed to specifically target unique antigens present in the bacteria or virus, but not present in mammals (Eukaryotes). This technique can be used to quickly determine if a subject has a specific viral or bacterial infection. 
In the case of respiratory viruses, many of which have similar broad symptoms, detection can be carried out using nasal wash samples from the subject with the suspected infection. Although shedding cells in the respiratory tract can be obtained, it is often in low numbers, and so an alternative method can be adopted where compatible cell culture can be exposed to infected nasal wash samples, so if the virus is present it can be grown up to a larger quantity, which can then give a clearer positive or negative reading. 
As with all types of fluorescence microscopy, the correct absorption wavelength needs to be determined in order to excite the fluorophore tag attached to the antibody, and detect the fluorescence given off, which indicates which cells are positive for the presence of the virus or bacteria being detected. 
Direct immunofluorescence can be used to detect deposits of immunoglobulins and complement[tpl]dn|date=August 2013[/tpl] proteins in biopsies of skin, kidney and other organs. Their presence is indicative of an autoimmune disease. When skin not exposed to the sun is tested, a positive direct IF (the so-called Lupus band test) is an evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2011; 7: 27–32. The lupus band test in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.

Cryptosporidium parvum is one of several protozoal species that cause cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic disease of the mammalian intestinal tract.
Primary symptoms of C. parvum infection are acute, watery, and non-bloody diarrhoea. C. parvum infection is of particular concern in immunocompromised patients, where diarrhoea can reach 10–15L per day. Other symptoms may include anorexia, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain. Extra-intestinal sites include the lung, liver and gall bladder where it causes respiratory cryptosporidosis, hepatitis and cholecystitis.”Cryptosporidiosis.” Laboratory Identification of Parasites of Public Health Concern. CDC. 5 Sept 2007. [tpl]Failed verification|date=January 2012[/tpl]
Infection is caused by ingestion of sporulated oocysts transmitted by the faecal-oral route. In healthy human hosts, the median infective dose is 132 oocysts.[tpl]cite journal |author=DuPont HL, Chappell CL, Sterling CR, Okhuysen PC, Rose JB, Jakubowski W |title=The infectivity of Cryptosporidium parvum in healthy volunteers |journal=N.

Invasion of the apical tip of ileal enterocytes by sporozoites and merozoites causes pathology seen in the disease. 
Infection is generally self-limiting in immunocompetent people. In immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, infection may not be self-limiting, leading to dehydration and, in severe cases, death.  
The diagnosis of C. parvum consists of serological tests and microscopic evaluation of oocysts in stools using Kinyoun acid-fast staining.
C. parvum is considered to be the most important waterborne pathogen in developed countries. The protozoa also caused the largest waterborne-disease outbreak ever documented in the United States, making 403,000 people ill in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1993. ”Surveillance for Waterborne-Disease Outbreaks -- United States, 1993-1994” CDC. 1996.

This record also marks the brief return of keyboardist/vocalist Paul Carrack. Carrack had last appeared on 1981's East Side Story, performing the lead vocals on one of Squeeze's most popular early singles, "Tempted." "Loving You Tonight" became only the second Squeeze album cut in thirteen years to feature Carrack singing a lead part. Additionally, bassist Keith Wilkinson wrote and sang "True Colours (The Storm)", the first song on a Squeeze album not written by Glenn Tilbrook, Chris Difford, Jools Holland, or any combination of those three. Difford has gone on record stating his displeasure with allowing Wilkinson his own song among Difford/Tilbrook originals. This record is produced by Squeeze and Peter Smith.

[[Louis Marks]]
CATEGORIES: 1928 births, Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford, British television producers, British television writers, 2010 deaths

Louis Frank Marks (23 March 1928http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/07/louis-marks-obituary – 17 September 2010) was a British script writer and producer mainly for the BBC. He attended Balliol College, Oxford and graduated with a DPhil. He made the surprising choice to become a writer. He began by contributing to The Adventures of Robin Hood in 1959 and continued to write and work in television into the new century, an exceptional record in modern television.
His early work was as a writer. His scripts included The Man Who Finally Died (1967) for the BBC and Special Branch for Thames Television (1970). He also wrote for Danger Man with Patrick McGoohan, and for the Doomwatch science fiction series and for Doctor Who on four occasions. The first of these, "Planet of Giants", opened the second season of the programme in 1964. His second script was "Day of the Daleks" in 1972 and as originally written, the serial revolved around the Ogrons instead of the Daleks. During the Tom Baker years he wrote the "Jekyll and Hyde" script for "Planet of Evil"; and then "The Masque of Mandragora", which was perhaps his most unusual script for Doctor Who and drew on his academic background and studies in Renaissance Italy.
He also served as a script editor on programmes such as Bedtime Stories (1974); The Stone Tape (1972); and No Exit (1972).
Marks' producer credits include The Lost Boys (1978), Fearless Frank (1979), the BBC's adaptation of the Three Theban plays (between 1984 and 1986), and the BBC's adaptation of George Eliot's Middlemarch (1994). He worked with Jack Clayton on an adaption of Muriel Spark's Memento Mori in 1991, Harold Pinter on The Hothouse 1987 and with Mike Leigh on Grown-ups 1982.
His most recent critical success was his production of Daniel Deronda by George Eliot for the BBC in 2002. 
He has worked with distinguished actors including Anthony Hopkins, Claire Bloom, John Gielgud, Nigel Hawthorne, Michael Gambon, Judi Dench and Ben Kingsley on the adaptation of another George Eliot work Silas Marner in 1986.
Marks died on 17 September 2010.http://www.atvnewsnetwork.co.uk/today/index.php/atv-today/4062-writer-and-producer-louis-marks-dies

The Carian language is an extinct language of the Luwian subgroup of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family. The Carian language was spoken in Caria, a region of western Anatolia between the ancient regions of Lycia and Lydia, by the Carians, a name possibly first mentioned in Hittite sources. Prior to the late 20th century CE the language remained a total mystery even though many characters of the script appeared to be from the Greek alphabet. Using Greek phonetic values of letters investigators of the 19th and 20th centuries were unable to make headway and classified the language as non-Indo-European. Speculations multiplied, none very substantial. Progress finally came as a result of rejecting the presumption of Greek phonetic values.

Charoite (K(Ca;Na)2Si4O10(OH;F)·H2O) is a rare silicate mineral, first described in 1978 and named for the Chara River. It has been reported only from the Sakha Republic, Yakutia, Siberia, Russia.  It is found where a syenite of the Murunskii Massif has intruded into and altered limestone deposits producing a potassium feldspar metasomatite.
Charoite is translucent lavender to purple in color with a pearly lustre.  Charoite is strictly massive in nature, and fractures are conchoidal.  It has an unusual swirling, fibrous appearance, sometimes chatoyant, and that, along with its intense color, can lead many to believe at first that it is synthetic or enhanced artificially.
Though reportedly discovered in the 1940s, it was not known to the outside world until its description in 1978.  It is said to be opaque and unattractive when found in the field; a fact that may have contributed to its late recognition. 
Charoite occurs in association with tinaksite and canasite.

[[Rim (coin)]]
CATEGORIES: Coins

The rim of a coin is the sharp circular (or otherwise shaped) edge which surrounds the coin design. 
This is the part which exceeds the area of the die which strikes the coin during production, and as a result is pushed upward and sharpened to form a sort of border around the coin's design. The raised rim reduces wear on the face of the coin.[tpl]sfn|Sherwood|1893|p=68[/tpl]
For accessibility purposes, the rim of the coin is sometimes milled with certain patterns in order for the blind to more easily distinguish between coins. In Australia, the two dollar coin has periodically distributed around its edge a short set of grooves, which alternate between the smooth rim, whilst the one dollar coin has a larger set of grooves, and the similar sized ten cent coin has grooves continuously about its edge.

'
Lithium batteries are disposable (primary) batteries that have lithium metal or lithium compounds as an anode.  They stand apart from other batteries in their high charge density (long life) and high cost per unit.  Depending on the design and chemical compounds used, lithium cells can produce voltages from 1.5 V (comparable to a zinc–carbon or alkaline battery) to about 3.7 V.
By comparison lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable batteries in which lithium ions move between the anode and the cathode, using an intercalated lithium compound as the electrode material instead of the metallic lithium used in lithium batteries.
Lithium batteries are widely used in products such as portable consumer electronic devices.

Heamoor: P A S Pool. A description of the village by Francis Kilvert who visited Cornwall for two weeks in 1870: ... and we came to a strange bare wild village where everything was made of granite – cottages, walls, roofs, pigs "crows" (sties), sheds, outbuildings, nothing but granite, enormous slabs of granite set up on end and roofed with other slabs.Maber, R. and Tregoning, A.

Lewis Greifer (19 December 1915 in London, England –  18 March 2003) was a writer for television, film, and radio.
After wartime service in the Royal Air Force (RAF), he pursued a career in journalism and joined the London Evening Standard. He contributed sketches for radio, including The Goon Show amongst others. A strong record on television writing in the 1950s and 1960s made his career; and by 1969 he diversified somewhat and devised the panel game show Whodunnit! for the BBC (which was later reformatted and remade by Thames Television as a vehicle for Jon Pertwee). 
Greifer also wrote episodes of The Prisoner, Crossroads, and the initial draft of the Tom Baker Doctor Who story Pyramids of Mars. The latter script had to be radically rewritten by script-editor Robert Holmes, who decided to use the pseudonym Stephen Harris on the final product. Greifer had meanwhile returned to teach at the University of Tel Aviv, and had little contact with television in his remaining years.

Augustin Lanner (23 January 1835, Vienna  –  27 September 1855, Vienna), sometimes known as August Lanner, was an Austrian composer, the son of the better-known Josef Lanner.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.johann-strauss.org.uk/composers/index.php3?content=lanner |title=Johann Strauss Society: Joseph Lanner |accessdate=2008-10-19|publisher=Johann Strauss Society[/tpl] He was first educated at the St. Anna-Schule but received no music instruction at that time. His earliest music education was first provided by his uncle, the K.k Hofopernkapellmeister Josef Strebinger in harmony and later took instructions in composition with the Viennese composer Josef Hellmesberger and also Professor Josef Mayseder. Among his first efforts at musical composition is a waltz which did not survive obscurity.
After his father's death in 1843, August conducted his father's orchestra when he was only 8 years old at the 'Bräuhausgarten in Fünfhaus' in front of some 2,000 visitors. Making his debut in 1853, he was destined to live only until he was 20 after suffering from a lung illness. In August Lanner's short-lived career, he composed some 30 dance pieces.

The album peaked at #46 on the Billboard Top LPs chart but failed to reach the UK Albums Chart.[tpl]Cite web|title=The Byrds Billboard Albums|publisher=Allmusic|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3810/charts-awards|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|accessdate=2010-03-22[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=275–279|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0[/tpl]  The song "I Trust (Everything Is Gonna Work Out Alright)" was released as a preceding single on May 7, 1971 in the United Kingdom but it did not chart.

[[Domino (Squeeze album)]]
CATEGORIES: 1998 albums, Squeeze (band) albums, Albums produced by Glenn Tilbrook

Domino is a 1998 album by the British New Wave group Squeeze. It is the band's twelfth studio album. After a career struggling with various major labels, the band decided to record and release Domino independently, on Glenn Tilbrook's own Quixotic Records. Core members Tilbrook and Chris Difford were joined by three brand new Squeeze members for this effort: drummer Ashley Soan, bassist Hilaire Penda, and keyboardist Chris Holland (Jools's younger brother). 
The album was hastily made, and received negative reactions from fans and critics. Difford and Tilbrook have both since denounced Domino as a weak effort, marred by time constraints and increasing friction between the two songwriters. Following a 1999 tour during which Difford failed to show up for a single show (he blamed troubles with alcoholism and an increasing hatred of touring), Squeeze decided to call it quits. 
The band's dislike of the album was highlighted when, after reforming in 2007, no tracks from Domino were performed during the band's UK and US tours until 2012 when "Without You Here" was played.  The only other Squeeze album that did not feature at all in the post-2007 tours was Play.

Bruno the Saxon (Latin: Bruno Saxonicus, also known as Bruno of Merseburg, (Bruno von Merseburg) was a German chronicler of the eleventh century and author of the "Historia de Bello Saxonico" or History of the Saxon Wars.[tpl]cite journal|title=English Historical Review xciv|year=1979|pages=723–37.[/tpl] Little is known of his life. He was apparently a Saxon monk belonging to the household of Archbishop Werner, of Magdeburg, who was a vigorous opponent of Henry IV and one of the leaders of the Saxon uprising against the emperor. After the death of the archbishop in 1078 at the hands of peasants, Bruno attached himself to Werner of Wolkenburg, Prince-Bishop of Merseburg, to whom, in 1082, he dedicated the work, "De Bello Saxonico" by which he is chiefly known. As its name indicates, it is a record of the struggles of the Saxons with the Emperor Henry IV. The author begins with an account of the youth of Henry and the evil influence exerted over him by Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen after he had passed from the stern tutelage of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne. He then traces the relations of the emperor with the Saxons and narrates at length the causes and events of the Saxon Rebellion, ending with the election of Hermann of Luxemburg as king in 1081.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03018b.htm|title=Bruno the Saxon|work=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA|accessdate=14 July 2011[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Nematodes with sequenced genomes, Parasitic nematodes, Plant pathogens and diseases, Tylenchida

Meloidogyne incognita is a nematode, a type of roundworm, in the family Heteroderidae. It is an important plant parasite classified in parasitology as a root-knot nematode, as it prefers to attack the root of its host plant. 
When M. incognita attacks the roots of plants, it sets up a feeding location, where it deforms the normal root cells and establishes giant cells. The roots become gnarled or nodulated, forming galls, hence the term "root-knot" nematode. 
It is commonly called the "southern root-knot nematode" or the "cotton root-knot nematode". This parasitic roundworm has worldwide distribution and numerous hosts. 
M. incognita has been found to be able to move along shallower temperature gradients (0.001C/cm) than any other known organism,Pline, Diez, and Dusenbery, J. Nematology, 20:605-608 (1988).

[[Historical language]]
CATEGORIES: Languages

Historical languages (also known as historic languages) are languages that were spoken in a historical period, but that are distinct from their modern form; that is, they are forms of languages historically attested to from the past which have evolved into more modern forms. Thus, historical languages contrast with dead languages (languages which have become extinct, or undergone language death). Also, historical languages contrast with reconstructed languages (that is, the proto-languages) of theoretical linguistics. One of the approaches to defining and using the concept of historical languages is implemented in the ISO 639 standards.

[[Echinococcus shiquicus]]

CATEGORIES: Cestoda, Parasitic animals

Echinococcus shiquicus is a parasitic worm first identified in 2006.  It was found in Tibetan foxes in the Qinghai–Tibet plateau region. Two types of adult worms were recovered and the variant which had a short strobila consisting of single immature and single gravid segments constituted the majority of the specimens. The strobila, rostellar hooks, location of the genital pore and the number of eggs in gravid uterus helped in differentiating Echinococcus shiquicus from the other species. The metacestode of E. shiquicus was detected exclusively from plateau pikas. The larvae are unique and they develop into unilocular minicysts approximately 1 cm in diameter within the liver or lungs.

CATEGORIES: State highways in Maryland, Roads in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, Roads in Baltimore County, Maryland, Roads in Baltimore, Maryland

Maryland Route 648 (MD 648) is a collection of state highways in the U.S. state of Maryland. These nine highways are current or former sections of the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard between Annapolis and Baltimore via Glen Burnie. There are five signed mainline segments of MD 648 through Arnold, Severna Park, Pasadena, Glen Burnie, Ferndale, and Pumphrey in northern Anne Arundel County; Baltimore Highlands in southern Baltimore County; and the independent city of Baltimore. MD 648 mainly serves local traffic along its meandering route, with long-distance traffic intended to use the parallel and straighter MD 2 south of Glen Burnie and freeway-grade Interstate 97, I-695, and MD 295 between Glen Burnie and Baltimore.
The Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was constructed in the early to mid-1910s as the primary highway between Baltimore and Annapolis. The highway was specifically authorized by the Maryland General Assembly, which insisted the Maryland State Roads Commission complete the highway along its originally planned route instead of using what is now MD 2 north of Glen Burnie. The boulevard was designated parts of MD 2 and MD 3 in 1927; the latter number was replaced with U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in 1939. MD 648 was assigned to the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard south of Glen Burnie in the late 1930s after it was functionally replaced by MD 2's present course. In the late 1950s, after US 301 was moved to freeways from south of Glen Burnie to Baltimore, MD 648 was extended north from Glen Burnie into Baltimore. MD 648 has had few major changes since then, the most significant being relocations between Pasadena and Glen Burnie in the 1970s.

As such, Farther Along can be seen as the band's answer to Melcher's over-production as well as an attempt to prove that they could produce an album superior to Byrdmaniax themselves.  Unfortunately, the rapidity with which The Byrds planned and recorded Farther Along resulted in yet another uneven LP, which the band themselves were unhappy with and which failed to undo the damage to their reputation inflicted by Byrdmaniax.[tpl]cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=330–334|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X[/tpl]

The A689 is a road in northern England that runs east from the A595, [tpl]convert|3.1|mi[/tpl] to the west of Carlisle in Cumbria, to Hartlepool in the North East.
The road begins west of Carlisle, just outside the city at the A595. The initial [tpl]convert|5.13|mi[/tpl] stretch is newly opened as part of the Carlisle Northern Development Route, a road bypassing Carlisle from west to north. Crossing the River Eden and the West Coast Main Line, the road intersects with Junction 44 of the M6 at Greymoorhill.[tpl]cite web|title=Carlisle Northern Development Route|url=http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/roads-transport/highways-pavements/CNDR/cndr.asp|publisher=Cumbria County Council[/tpl] From Junction 44 of the M6, the A689 runs roughly south-east to a roundabout, with the B6264. From here, the A689 heads east, and crosses the River Irthing at Ruleholme, then it meets the A69 at a roundabout junction. The A689 joins the route of the A69 around part of the Brampton bypass. Near the village of Milton, the A689 turns right, and continues through Milton and Hallbankgate before crossing the border into the county of Northumberland.
The route continues roughly south-east, and re-enters the county of Cumbria just north of small market town of Alston. After passing through Alston, the A689 eventually crosses the border into County Durham, where the route still heads gradually south-east through Weardale.  At Killhope Cross between Killhope and Nenthead the road reaches a height of [tpl]convert|2056|ft|m[/tpl], making it the equal highest paved pass in England (or 3rd highest A road in England.A Compendium of High Roads and Road Passes in Great Britain, Alan Kind & Friends http://web.me.com/mondard/Hodology/Highest_Roads_files/Highest%20Roads%20Part%201.pdf)
At a roundabout with the A68, the A689 briefly joins the route of the A690, before turning right in the town of Crook (for a few years has bypassed Crook town centre and now uses a new bypass). Heading south-easterly still, the A689 encounters the town of Bishop Auckland, where it temporarily heads north-easterly (where it merges with the A688), before setting off in an easterly direction north of Bishop Auckland. 
The A689 meets the A167 at the Rushyford roundabout, then shortly comes across the A1(M) at Junction 60. The A689 by-passes the town of Sedgefield, and becomes dual carriageway standard for the remainder of the route, after the section between Sedgefield and Wynyard was upgraded to dual carriageway in 2001. The A689 meets the A19 near Wolviston, before turning north-east and eventually terminating close to the centre of Hartlepool.

Queen Savang Vadhana of Siam ([tpl]lang-th|สว่างวัฒนา[/tpl]; RTGS: Sawang Watthana, 10 September 1862 – 17 December 1955) was a consort of King Chulalongkorn or Rama V. Her full name and title was Queen Sri Savarindira ([tpl]lang-th|ศรีสวรินทิรา[/tpl]; RTGS: Si Sawarinthira) – thus she was not the Rajini (queen), but just was a highest consort. Already long widowed, after her first grandson's accession in 1935 she became known as Somdech Phra Phan Vasa Ayyika Chao (สมเด็จพระพันวัสสาอัยยิกาเจ้า; [tpl]RTGS|Somdet Phra Phan Watsa Ai-yika Chao[/tpl]), which means The Queen Grandmother because she was the grandmother of both King Ananda Mahidol and the present king King Bhumibol Adulyadej or Rama IX.

Suryavarman I ([tpl]lang-km|សូរ្យវរ្ម័នទី១[/tpl]; posthumously Nirvanapada) was king of the Khmer Empire from 1010 to 1050. Suryavarman usurped King Udayadityavarman I, defeating his armies in approximately 1002. After a protracted war with Udayadityavarman's would-be successor, Jayaviravarman who was of Malay origin from Old Malay Kingdom (currently Malaysia),[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2014 |title =Suryavarman I |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/575497/Suryavarman-I |accessdate=February 24, 2014[/tpl]  Suryavarman I claimed the throne in 1010. Suryavarman was the son of the king of Tambralinga,[tpl]cite book|last=Quaritch|first=H. G.|title=Angkor and Rome: A Historical Comparison|date=1965|publisher=Bernard Quaritch, Ltd|location=Wales. London[/tpl]  a minor Buddhist kingdom on the Malay peninsula (present-day Thailand) that was a dependent of Angkor's rival Srivijaya. Suryavarman held claim to the Khmer throne through his Khmer mother who was a member of the royal family.  While the Khmer Empire predominantly practiced Vaishnava Hinduism, Suryavarman was a Mahayana Buddhist who was also tolerant of the growing Theravada Buddhist presence in the Khmer kingdom.
Suryavarman I established diplomatic relations with the Chola dynasty of south India. Suryavarman I sent a chariot as a present to the Chola Emperor Rajaraja Chola I. Indian History by Reddy: p.64 It seems that the Khmer king Suryavarman I requested aid from the powerful Chola Emperor Rajendra Chola against Tambralinga  kingdom .Kenneth R. Hall (October 1975), "Khmer Commercial Development and Foreign Contacts under Sūryavarman I", Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient 18 (3), pp. 318-336, Brill Publishers  After learning of Suryavarman's alliance with Rajendra Chola, the Tambralinga kingdom requested aid from the Srivijaya king Sangrama Vijayatungavarman.Kenneth R.

Majumdar (1961), "The Overseas Expeditions of King Rājendra Cola", Artibus Asiae 24 (3/4), pp. 338-342, Artibus Asiae Publishers This eventually led to the Chola Empire coming into conflict with the Srivijiya Empire. The war ended with a victory for the Chola dynasty and Angkor Wat of the Khmer Empire, and major losses for the Sri Vijaya  Empire and the Tambralinga  kingdom.Kenneth R. Hall (October 1975), "Khmer Commercial Development and Foreign Contacts under Sūryavarman I", Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient 18 (3), pp. 318-336, Brill Publishers R. C.

His reign lasted some 40 years and he spent much of that time defending it. Known as the "King of the Just Laws," he consolidated his political power by inviting some four thousand local officials to the royal palace and swear an oath of allegiance to him. Suryavarman I favored Buddhism but he allowed the people to continue practising Hinduism.
His palace was situated in the vicinity of Angkor Thom, and he was the first of the Khmers rulers to protect his palace with a wall. In 1022 Suryavarman I expanded his territory to the west to Lopburi in Thailand and into Laos.  
The major constructions built by this king were the Prasat Preah Vihear, on Dangrek Mountain, and Phimeanakas. Suryavarman I also started the second Angkor reservoir, the West Baray, which is 8 km long and 2.2 km wide. It held more than 123 million liters of water.[tpl]cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Michael|last2=Jacques|first2=Claude|title=Ancient Angkor|year= 2006|publisher=River Books|isbn= 974-8225-27-5|page=188[/tpl] This is the largest Khmer reservoir that survives. There is some indication that Suryavarman I sent a gift to Rajendra Chola I the Emperor of the Chola Empire to possibly facilitate trade.Economic Development, Integration, and Morality in Asia and the Americas  by Donald C. Wood p.176
Suryavarman I died in 1050 and was given the posthumous title Nirvanapada ("the king who has gone to nirvana"), a nod to his Buddhist beliefs. He was succeeded by his sons, Udayadityavarman II, who died around 1066 and Harshavarman III (Sadasivapada). The latter continued the struggle against internal rebellions and fought back assaults from the Chams until his death in 1080.

Vorbasse with a population of 1,322 (1 January 2013)"BEF44: Population 1st January, by urban areas" database from Statistics Denmark is the 4th largest town in Billund Municipality,  Region of Southern Denmark, Denmark.
Annually, the biggest market in Denmark is arranged, Vorbasse Market (running for the 275th year, as of 2005), with approximately 250,000 visitors. The town is also renowned for having its own little naval port, Vorbasse Krigshavn, actually a village pond dominated by the bridge of a former Russian submarine from 1988 until its removal during the 2003 renovation. It still harbours the model warship 'Labri', which is ceremonially launched every Easter.
In archaeology Vorbasse is well known for its large scale excavations of a settlement that had existed from the 1st century BC to the 11th century AD. The settlement consisted of a number of identical farms spread along a central street. The farm buildings, each set within its own large enclosure, contained a long house  with generally sloping stone walls built without mortar and several smaller surrounding annexes. The roof of the long house tended to be curved with the centre being higher than the ends.Neveux, Francois.  The Normans, p.11.  Constable & Robinson Ltd. Translation copyright © Howard Curtis 2008.

[[Sestiere]]
CATEGORIES: Subdivisions of Italy

A sestiere (plural: sestieri) is a subdivision of certain Italian towns and cities. The word is from sesto, or sixth; and is thus used only for towns divided into six districts. The best-known example are the sestieri of Venice, but Ascoli Piceno, Genoa, Milan and Rapallo, for example, were also divided into sestieri. The medieval Lordship of Negroponte, in the island of Euboea, was also at times divided into six distinct rulerships through the arbitration of Venice, which were known as sestieri. The island of Crete, a Venetian colony (the "Kingdom of Candia") since the Fourth Crusade, was also divided into six parts, named after the sestieri of Venice herself, while the capital Candia retained the status of a commune of Venice. Also, the island of Burano north of Venice is subdivided into sestieri.
A variation of the word is occasionally met with; the comune of Leonessa, for example, is divided into sesti or sixths.
Other Italian towns with fewer than six official districts are frequently divided into analogous quartieri (4, whence the English word "quarter" to mean a neighbourhood) or terzieri (3); some towns merely refer to these neighbourhoods by the non-number-specific rioni. Sestieri, quartieri, terzieri, rioni, and their analogues are usually no longer administrative divisions of these towns, but historical and traditional communities, most often seen in their sharpest relief in the town's annual palio.

Hippuric acid (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine) is a carboxylic acid found in the urine of horses and other herbivores. Hippuric acid crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C and decompose at about 240 °C. High concentrations of hippuric acid may also indicate a toluene intoxication; however, scientists have called this correlation into question because there are other variables that influence levels of hippuric acid.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=19891605|year=2010|last1=Pero|first1=RW|title=Health consequences of catabolic synthesis of hippuric acid in humans|volume=5|issue=1|pages=67–73|journal=Current clinical pharmacology[/tpl]  When many aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and toluene are taken internally, they are converted to hippuric acid by reaction with the amino acid, glycine.

Taeniidae [tpl]IPAc-en|t|ɨ|ˈ|n|aɪ|.|ɨ|d|iː[/tpl] is a family of flatworms.  It is the largest family representing the order Cyclophyllidea. It includes many tapeworms of medical and veterinary importance, as Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) and Echinococcus granulosus. The family Taeniidae are parasites of mammals and include many which are infectious to humans.  
Taeniidae parasites are distinguished by their terrestrial life cycles, which include a dormant stage called a metacestode. These develop in the intermediate host's tissue when eggs are consumed.  The eggs hatch into a oncosphere, which pass through the intestinal walls and form the metacestode.  An example is either cysticercoid, cysticercus, or a hydatid cyst.  The definitive host is infected when the metacestode is consumed.

It comprises the strip of land between the Floating Harbour to the north and the tidal New Cut of the River Avon to the south, from the dock entrance to the west to Bathurst Basin in the east. The island forms part of Cabot ward.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/WardFinder/pdfs/cabotmap-high.pdf |format=PDF| title = Cabot Ward Map | publisher = Bristol City Council | accessdate =20 June 2006 [/tpl]Ordnance Survey (2005). OS Explorer Map 155 – Bristol & Bath. ISBN 0-319-23609-9.
Spike Island was created by William Jessop in the early 19th century, when he constructed the New Cut, and converted the former course of the River Avon into the Floating Harbour. Until the Second World War, a lock connected Bathurst Basin with the New Cut, and Spike Island was a genuine island surrounded on all sides by water. However, fears that an aerial attack on this lock at low tide could lead to a disastrous dewatering of the docks led to the lock being filled in.
Historically, Spike Island was the site of working quays, shipyards, warehousing, and other associated dockside industry. The Bristol Harbour Railway runs the length of the island, and formerly connected these working areas with the railway network. With the redevelopment of the docks, the Island has become an area popular with developers looking to create prime dock side housing such as Baltic Wharf, The Point and Perretts Court. There are also a few restaurants and popular pubs such as The Cottage. The rest of the area of Bristol between the Docks and New cut is in Redcliffe and St Phillip's Marsh.
Other former dock related buildings have become cultural venues or museums. These include:
The path of the harbour railway across Spike Island is proposed for a £38 million rapid transit bus route from Ashton Vale to the City Centre. The existing steam railway would be retained, but buses would gain a congestion-free journey into the city.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.westofengland.org/media/184380/rt%20scheme%20summary_spring2010-web.pdf | title= West of England Rapid Transit Ashton Vale to Temple Meads and Bristol City Centre Scheme Summary II – Spring 2010 | publisher= West of England Partnership | format= PDF | accessdate=8 July 2010[/tpl] Subject to planning permission, and finances, work could start 2012 with services running 2014.

Its maze of abandoned chemical factories, rail lines, canal and industrial dockage, and industrial pollution, which had declined into a rust belt toxic wilderness, was reclaimed as woodland, wetlands and green space between 1975 and 1982. A surviving warehouse is now the home of the Catalyst Museum, the only science museum in the UK solely devoted to chemistry.
Spike Island was the site of a famous outdoor concert by The Stone Roses in May 1990. A film about the concert was released in 2013, and is called Spike Island.[tpl]cite web|last=Wright |first=Jade |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2012/03/26/new-film-to-relive-the-stone-roses-classic-gig-at-spike-island-in-widnes-100252-30622394/ |title=New film to relive The Stone Roses’ classic gig at Spike Island in Widnes - ECHO Entertainment News - Entertainment |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl]

Book of Love is an American synthpop and electronic band, formed in 1983 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and later based out of New York City. Led by vocalist Susan Ottaviano, the band also includes keyboardists Ted Ottaviano (no relation to Susan), Lauren Roselli and Jade Lee. The band gained its first exposure as the opening act for two Depeche Mode tours in 1985 and 1986. The group has been described by the Houston Press as "forward thinking" for lyrics dealing with sexual orientation and gender roles.Book of Love: Open Book Houston Press April 24, 2013
Their biggest success came on the US dance charts, placing seven singles in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart between 1985 and 1993.[ref]
</ref> The group's largest exposure on pop radio was with the song "[[Pretty Boys And Pretty Girls (Book of Love song)|Pretty Boys And Pretty Girls]]", one of the first songs to openly address the [[AIDS]] epidemic.<ref name="Billboard Hot 100"/> The song, from the album ''[[Lullaby (Book of Love album)|Lullaby]]'', was originally the second half of a medley with the group's version of [[Mike Oldfield]]'s "[[Tubular Bells]]," the 1973 instrumental that served as the eerie theme music of the classic horror film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''. Edited down to single length, "[[Pretty Boys And Pretty Girls (Book of Love song)|Pretty Boys And Pretty Girls]]" became Book of Love's only [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] entry, peaking at number 90 in 1988.<ref name="Billboard Hot 100">
</ref>
Book of Love's music has been featured in various films and television over the years. The band's song "Modigliani (Lost In Your Eyes)" was featured in the 1987 John Hughes film Planes, Trains & Automobiles as well as in the Miami Vice episode, "God's Work". In 1991, the song "Sunny Day" was featured in the movie The Silence of the Lambs, in a scene in which band member Lauren Roselli also had a cameo with principal actor Jodie Foster.Fearscene.com Review, n.d., URL accessed 11-11-2007 Also, the song "Enchanted," from the band's Lovebubble album, appeared on the soundtrack to the 1993 film Naked in New York.
Since their active years, Book of Love's songs "Boy" and "I Touch Roses" have been rediscovered by new audiences. Both their original versions and subsequent remixes are heard in both dance clubs and on alternative radio stations. 
In February, 2001 — sixteen years after its first dance chart entry — Book of Love had its first number-one hit on the US dance chart when "Boy," a track originally from its debut album, was remixed and re-released as the lead single from their greatest hits collection, I Touch Roses: The Best of Book of Love.
In 2013, the band reunited for a string of club tour dates and has been working on new material.

[[Night of the Long Knives (1962)]]

CATEGORIES: Cabinet reshuffles in the United Kingdom, 1962 in politics, 1962 in the United Kingdom

The term Night of the Long Knives in British politics is used for a major Cabinet reshuffle that took place on 13 July 1962. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan dismissed seven members of his Cabinet, one-third of the total. The speed and scale of the reshuffle caused it to be associated by its critics with the 1934 Night of the Long Knives in Germany.
The reshuffle took place against a backdrop of declining Conservative popularity in Britain. Conservative candidates fared poorly in several by-elections, losing ground to Liberal candidates. Concerned that traditional Conservative voters were expressing their disapproval with the government's economic policies by switching to the Liberals, Harold Macmillan planned to replace his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd, with Reginald Maudling. Lloyd had already clashed with Macmillan over his economic strategies, and Maudling was considered to be more amenable to the economic policies Macmillan wished to implement. The reshuffle was also an attempt to reinvigorate the party, bringing in younger and more dynamic figures and replacing some of the older and less capable ministers. After discussions with Conservative Party Chairman Iain Macleod and Home Secretary Rab Butler, a reshuffle was planned for Autumn 1962.
Macmillan was overtaken by events when Butler leaked the details of the reshuffle to press baron Lord Rothermere over lunch on 11 July. The newspapers reported the impending changes on 12 July, and Macmillan made the decision to press ahead with the reshuffle at once. Lloyd was called to a meeting that evening and dismissed. The remaining six were informed the following day, 13 July. Macmillan faced sharp criticism over the scale of the changes, and his political opponents both within the Conservative Party and in the Opposition characterised him as ruthless and opportunistic. Despite an initial sharp drop in his approval ratings, opinion eventually swung back in his favour and the Party recovered. Macmillan regretted the way the reshuffle was carried out, and was particularly concerned about his treatment of Lloyd, who was a loyal confidant. Despite the dramatic changes in the Cabinet, the Conservatives were rocked by a series of scandals in 1963, causing Macmillan to eventually resign as Prime Minister, before the Party's defeat in the 1964 general election.

The product was introduced in 1975 and was discontinued by May 1976, having rapidly gained a reputation for causing excessive flatulence. Bambeanos cost Colgate $750,000 to develop and market before being withdrawn with fewer than 25,000 cases sold. A jury later awarded $571,000 to the roasting contractor, United Roasters, after Colgate's withdrawal.United Roasters, Inc. v.

[[Terziere]]

CATEGORIES: Subdivisions of Italy

A terziere (plural: terzieri) is a subdivision of several towns in Italy. The word derives from terzo, meaning "third"; and is thus used only for towns divided into three neighborhoods. Terzieri are most commonly met with in Umbria, as for example at Trevi, Spello, Narni and Città della Pieve; towns divided into terzieri in other regions include  Lucca in Tuscany. Ancona and Macerata in the Marches. The medieval Lordship of Negroponte, in the island of Euboea, was also divided into three distinct rulerships, which were known as terzieri.
Other Italian towns with more than three official neighborhoods are frequently divided into analogous quartieri (4, whence the English word "quarter" to mean a neighborhood) or sestieri (6); some towns merely refer to these neighborhoods by the non-number-specific rioni. Terzieri, quartieri, sestieri, rioni, and their analogues are usually no longer administrative divisions of these towns, but historical and traditional communities, most often seen in their sharpest relief in the town's annual palio.

The Parlington estate has a number of interesting features: the grade II* listed Triumphal Arch, designed by Thomas Leverton and built around the end of the Eighteenth Century, which is unique in commemorating the victory of the American colonialists over the British in the American War of Independence. An inscription on both faces of the arch reads, "Liberty in N.America Triumphant MDCCLXXXIII"; a tunnel known locally as the "Dark Arch", which was built to shield the inhabitants of the hall from traffic passing along Parlington Lane, still intact almost two hundred years later; an underground icehouse, also intact — a testament to Georgian brick construction.

The Patrologia Graeca (or Patrologiae Cursus Completus, Series Graeca) is an edited collection of writings by the Christian Church Fathers and various secular writers, in the Greek language. It consists of 161 volumes produced in 1857–1866 by J. P. Migne's Imprimerie Catholique, Paris. It includes both the Eastern Fathers and those Western authors who wrote before Latin became predominant in the Western Church in the 3rd century, e.g. the early writings collectively known as the Apostolic Fathers, such as the First and Second Epistle of Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas, Eusebius, Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa.
The 161 volumes are bound as 166 (vols. 16 and 87 being in three parts and vol. 86 in two). An important final volume, which included some supplements and a full index, was never published, as the plates were destroyed in a fire (1868) at the printer.Ferdinando Cavallera, Patrologia Graeca Cursus Completus - Indices, Apud Garnier Fratres, Paris, p. 21
The first series contained only Latin translations of the originals (81 vols., 1856-61). The second series contains the Greek text with a Latin translation (166 vols., 1857-66). The texts are interlaced, with one column of Greek and a corresponding column on the other side of the page that is the Latin translation. Where the Greek original has been lost, as in the case of Irenaeus, the extant Greek fragments are interspersed throughout the Latin text. In one instance, the original is preserved in Syriac only and translated into Latin. Quite often, information about the author is provided, also in Latin.
A Greek, D. Scholarios, added a half-published list of the authors and subjects, (Athens, 1879) and began a complete table of contents (Athens, 1883). In 1912, Garnier Frères, Paris, published a Patrologia Graeca index volume, edited by Ferdinando Cavallera.

John Breathitt (September 9, 1786 – February 21, 1834) was the 11th Governor of Kentucky. He was the first Democrat to hold this office and was the second Kentucky governor to die in office. Shortly after his death, Breathitt County, Kentucky was created and named in his honor.
Early in life, Breathitt was appointed a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory. On his return to Kentucky, he taught at a country school, and through wise investments, amassed enough wealth to sustain him while he studied law with Judge Caleb Wallace. In 1811, he was elected to the first of several terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 1828. Although his running mate William T. Barry lost the office of governor to Thomas Metcalfe, Breathitt defeated his opponent for lieutenant governor. 
During his term as lieutenant governor, Breathitt was one of several proposed candidates to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate, but the General Assembly deadlocked over the appointment and the seat went unfilled until the Assembly's next term. In the next gubernatorial election in 1832, Breathitt was the Democratic nominee for governor. Again, Breathitt won, but James Turner Morehead, the Whig candidate for lieutenant governor, defeated Breathitt's running mate. Initially, Breathitt enjoyed popularity for his public condemnation of John C. Calhoun's doctrine of nullification, but he did not fare well in state politics because the Whigs controlled the legislature. He died in office of tuberculosis on February 21, 1834.

In 1999, the first Continuum Fingerboard was commercially sold. Until 2008, the Continuum Fingerboard provided IEEE-1394 (FireWire) connections to control a Kyma sound design workstation, as well as MIDI connections to control a MIDI synthesizer module. More recently, the Continuum Fingerboard generates audio directly in addition to providing MIDI connections for MIDI modules, software synthesizers, and Kyma (the IEEE-1394 connection that was present on earlier models has been removed).  An external control voltage generator permits control of analog modular synthesizers.

[[Gascoigne baronets]]
CATEGORIES: English families, History of Yorkshire, Baronetcies

The Gascoigne Baronetcy, of Barnbow and Parlington in the County of York, was a title in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. It was created on 8 June 1635 for John Gascoigne. He had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1604. His son Sir Thomas, 2nd Baronet, was accused of conspiracy to murder the KIng in the mythical Popish Plot, but acquitted. The eighth Baronet was Member of Parliament for Thirsk, Malton and Arundel. He renounced Catholicism, and was much involved in the Irish Parliament and in horse racing. Sir Thomas died in 1810, the year after his only son died in a hunting accident, upon which the baronetcy became either extinct or dormant.
The surname Gascoigne derives from Gascony in France[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]. The best-known family of this name believed to have come to England at the time of the Norman Conquest [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl], settled in Yorkshire, although this is not proven. The Gascoignes were established by the thirteenth century at Gawthorpe and Harewood; these estates passed in 1567 to the Wentworth family by the marriage of the Gascoigne heiress.  The junior branch acquired estates at Lasingcroft in 1392 and moved in the 16th century firstly to Barnbow near Leeds and then to Parlington Hall, Parlington, situated west of Aberford, near Leeds, acquired from the Wentworths in 1546.
Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th and last Baronet, succeeded his brother in 1762. He left his property, including Parlington Hall, to his stepdaughter on the condition that her husband, Richard Oliver of Castle Oliver in County Limerick, change his name to Richard Oliver Gascoigne (see Oliver Gascoigne). In 1825, Richard acquired Lotherton Hall from a fellow turf enthusiast. In 1843 the estates were inherited by Richard Oliver Gascoigne's two daughters, Mary Isabella and Elizabeth, who took one estate each on their marriages.
Mary Isabella and her husband Frederick Charles Trench, who took the surname Trench Gascoigne, lived at Parlington, while Lotherton became the property of Elizabeth Gascoigne, who married Frederick Charles' cousin Frederic Mason Trench, 2nd Baron Ashtown. The Ashtowns lived mostly in Ireland, on the estates of the Trench family and at Castle Oliver, and when in 1893 Elizabeth died, leaving no children of her own, Lotherton passed to her nephew Colonel Frederick Richard Thomas Trench-Gascoigne, (4 July 1851 - 2 June 1937), from the Royal Horse Guards and a DSO in 1900, a well-known soldier and traveler of the day.
Colonel Gascoigne further inherited Parlington in 1905, but preferred Lotherton. The furnishings and some structural items from Parlington Hall were transferred to Lotherton, after which Parlington was allowed to decay until, apart from the west wing, still standing, it was demolished in a number of stages from around 1911 to 1968. The most prominent artefact removed to Lotherton Hall was the Thomas Banks bas-relief marble of the classic scene Alcyone and Ceyx.
The Gascoignes continued at Lotherton Hall  until the death of Sir Alvary Gascoigne, a.k.a. Sir Alvary Douglas Frederick Trench-Gascoigne, (6 August 1893 - 18 April 1970),  formerly a British Ambassador to Japan, 1946 - 1951, or rather a Political advisor to Japan, 1946-1951,   British Ambassador to Russia, 1951 - 1953, a CMG in 1942, KCMG in 1948, GBE in 1953,   whose son, Captain Douglas Wilder Trench-Gascoigne, (11 November 1917 - August 1944) had predeceased him while fighting in WWII, in August 1944. 
The property was presented to the City of Leeds for the public benefit and is now open to the public.

Mariscal Sucre International Airport ([tpl]lang-es|Aeropuerto Internacional Mariscal Sucre[/tpl]) [tpl]airport codes|UIO|SEQU[/tpl] was the main international airport serving Quito, Pichincha Province, Ecuador. It was the busiest airport in Ecuador by passenger traffic, by aircraft movement and by cargo movement, and one of the busiest airports in South America. It was named after Venezuelan-born Antonio José de Sucre, a hero of Ecuadorian and Latin American independence. It began operations in 1960, and during its last years of operation, handled about 6.2 million passengers and 164,000 metric tons of freight per year. The airport, one of the highest in the world (at [tpl]convert|2800|m|ft|disp=or[/tpl] AMSL) is located in the northern part of the city, in the Chaupicruz parish, within 5 minutes of Quito's financial center; the terminals are located at the intersection of Amazonas and La Prensa avenues. Mariscal Sucre International was the largest hub for TAME with an average of 50 daily departures. It is now the biggest urban park in Quito.
The old Mariscal Sucre International Airport ceased all operations at 19:00 (7:00 p.m.) on February 19, 2013, following the departure of TAME flight 321 to Guayaquil (scheduled for 18:55). Iberia operated the final international departure from the airport. On February 20, 2013, all operations moved to the new Mariscal Sucre International Airport. The first domestic flights scheduled to arrive at the new airport were TAME Flight 302 originating in Guayaquil, and LAN Flight 2590 originating in Lima, Peru. Arrival times were scheduled for 9:00 and 9:30 a.m. respectively.http://www.elcomercio.com/quito/inaguracion-aeropuerto_Mariscal_Sucre-financiamiento_0_868113434.htmlhttp://www.elcomercio.com/quito/Tababela-inaugurara-vuelos_0_868713147.html
Due to its location in the middle of a city surrounded by mountains, the old airport could no longer be expanded to accommodate any larger aircraft or an increase in air traffic. Its operation posed risks; six serious accidents and several incidents have occurred in recent years.Report on the conditions of the current airport and the benefits of a new airport (Inter-American Development Bank)[tpl]cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19980829-0&lang=en|title=ASN Aircraft accident Tupolev 154M CU-T1264 Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO)|date=13 November 2005|work=Aviation Safety Network|publisher=Flight Safety Foundation|accessdate=8 April 2009[/tpl] The new airport is being built in the Tababela parish, about 18 km to the east of the city.

[[Platysma muscle]]

CATEGORIES: Muscles of the head and neck

The platysma is a superficial muscle that overlaps the sternocleidomastoid.
It is a broad sheet arising from the fascia covering the upper parts of the pectoralis major and deltoid; its fibers cross the clavicle, and proceed obliquely upward and medially along the side of the neck.
The anterior fibers interlace below and behind the symphysis menti, with the fibers of the muscle of the opposite side; the posterior fibers cross the mandible, some being inserted into the bone below the oblique line, others into the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the lower part of the face.  Many of these fibers blend with the muscles about the angle and lower part of the mouth.
Sometimes fibers can be traced to the zygomaticus,[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] or to the margin of the orbicularis oris. Beneath the platysma, the external jugular vein descends from the angle of the mandible to the clavicle.

Cross-tolerance is a phenomenon that occurs when someone who is tolerant to the effects of a certain drug also develops a tolerance to another drug. It often happens between two drugs with similar functions or effects – for example, acting on the same cell receptor or affecting the transmission of certain neurotransmitters. Cross-tolerance has been observed with pharmaceutical drugs such as anti-anxiety agents and illicit substances, and sometimes the two of them together. Often, a person who uses one drug can be tolerant to a drug that has a completely different function.Kolb, Bryan, and Ian Whishaw. An Introduction to Brain and Behavior. New York: Worth Publishers, 2014. Print. This phenomenon allows one to become tolerant to a drug that they have never even used before. The Free Dictionary

CATEGORIES: Political parties established in 1961, Liberal parties in Greece, Defunct political parties in Greece

The Centre Union (EK, Greek: Ένωσις Κέντρου, Enosis Kentrou) was a Greek political party, created in 1961 by George Papandreou, senior.
The party was elected to power in 1963, with Papandreou as Prime Minister. In 1965, King Constantine forced Papandreou from the office following the Apostasia of 1965 plan, designed by him and executed by Center Union's politician Konstantinos Mitsotakis. He then formed a new government using the apostates, ex-members of EK, and installed Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas as prime minister. Athanasiadis attempted to gain a vote of confidence in parliament, but the EK party was split in two, and a political crisis ensued that led to the period of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974.
The Centre Union Party was the last Venizelist party to hold power in Greece. The party nominally continued to exist until 1977 (after the Junta it was known as the Center Union - New Forces), when its successor Union of the Democratic Centre (EDIK) party was created. Konstantinos Mitsotakis, who had defected the EK in 1965, formed a rival Venizelist party, known as the "Party of New Liberals", which merged with New Democracy in 1978.

John was born in Château d'Essay, the son of Peter II of Alençon and Marie de Chamaillard. In 1404, he succeeded his father as Count of Alençon and Perche. He was made Duke of Alençon in 1414.
He commanded the second division of the French army at the Battle of Agincourt. When the English broke through the first division, he led a countercharge. He is sometimes credited with killing Edward, Duke of York, wounding Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and cutting an ornament from the crown of Henry V of England; but he was then overpowered by the King's bodyguard, and slain by the Welsh nobleman Dafydd Gam before he could yield himself.

Power density (or volume power density or volume specific power) is the amount of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume.
In energy transformers like batteries, fuel cells, motors, etc. but also power supply units or similar, power density refers to a volume. It is then also called volume power density which is expressed as W/m3.
Volume power density is sometimes an important consideration where space is constrained.
In reciprocating internal combustion engines, power density- power per swept volume is an important metric.

In German and Austrian patent laws, the Gebrauchsmuster (GebrM), also known as German utility model or Austrian utility model, is a patent-like, intellectual property right protecting inventions.
The Gebrauchsmuster is slightly different from the patent. It mainly differs from the patent in that processes and methods cannot be protected by a Gebrauchsmuster, only products can. Furthermore, the term of a Gebrauchsmuster, that is its maximal lifetime, is 10 years from the date of registration. In contrast, a patent has usually a term of 20 years from the date of filing of the application.

[[Kelvin probe force microscope]]
CATEGORIES: Scanning probe microscopy, Condensed matter physics, Surface chemistry, Electric and magnetic fields in matter

Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), also known as surface potential microscopy, is a noncontact variant of atomic force microscopy (AFM), and was invented in 1991.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://dns.ntu-ccms.ntu.edu.tw/references/APPL_PHYS_LETT-58-2921-1991.pdf|format=free-download pdf|journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|year=1991|title=Kelvin probe force microscopy|volume=58|page=2921|doi=10.1063/1.105227|author=M. Nonnenmacher, M. P. O'Boyle, and H. K. Wickramasinghe|bibcode = 1991ApPhL..58.2921N|issue=25 [/tpl] With KPFM, the work function of surfaces can be observed at atomic or molecular scales. The work function relates to many surface phenomena, including catalytic activity, reconstruction of surfaces, doping and band-bending of semiconductors, charge trapping in dielectrics and corrosion. The map of the work function produced by KPFM gives information about the composition and electronic state of the local structures on the surface of a solid.
KPFM is a scanning probe method where the potential offset between a probe tip and a surface can be measured using the same principle as a macroscopic Kelvin probe. The cantilever in the AFM is a reference electrode that forms a capacitor with the surface, over which it is scanned laterally at a constant separation. The cantilever is not piezoelectrically driven at its mechanical resonance frequency ω0 as in normal AFM although an alternating current (AC) voltage is applied at this frequency. 
When there is a direct-current (DC) potential difference between the tip and the surface, the AC+DC voltage offset will cause the cantilever to vibrate. The origin of the force can be understood by considering that the energy of the capacitor formed by the cantilever and the surface is 
plus terms at DC. Only the cross-term proportional to the VDC·VAC product is at the resonance frequency ω0. The resulting vibration of the cantilever is detected using usual scanned-probe microscopy methods (typically involving a diode laser and a four-quadrant detector). A null circuit is used to drive the DC potential of the tip to a value which minimizes the vibration. A map of this nulling DC potential versus the lateral position coordinate therefore produces an image of the work function of the surface.
A related technique, electrostatic force microscopy (EFM), directly measures the force produced on a charged tip by the electric field emanating from the surface. EFM operates much like magnetic force microscopy in that the frequency shift or amplitude change of the cantilever oscillation is used to detect the electric field. However, EFM is much more sensitive to topographic artifacts than KPFM. Both EFM and KPFM require the use of conductive cantilevers, typically metal-coated silicon or silicon nitride.

[[Bruriah]]
CATEGORIES: Roman-era Jews, Talmud people, Judaism and women, Rebbetzins

Bruriah ([tpl]lang-he-n|ברוריה[/tpl]) is one of several women quoted as a sage in the Talmud. She was the wife of the Tanna Rabbi Meir and the daughter of Rabbi Hananiah Ben Teradion, who is listed as one of the "Ten Martyrs." She is greatly admired for her breadth of knowledge in matters pertaining to both halachah and aggadah, and is said to have learned from the rabbis 300 halachot on a single cloudy day (Tractate Pesachim 62b). Her parents were put to death by the Romans for teaching Torah, but she carried on their legacy. 
Bruriah was very involved in the halachic discussions of her time, and even challenges her father on a matter of ritual purity (Tosefta Keilim Bava Kamma 4:9). Her comments there are praised by Rabbi Judah Ben Bava. In another instance, Rabbi Joshua praises her intervention in a debate between Rabbi Tarfon and the sages, saying "Bruriah has spoken correctly" (Tosefta Keilim Bava Metzia 1:3). 
She was also renowned for her sharp wit and often caustic jibes. The Talmud (Tractate Eruvin 53b) relates that she once chastised Rabbi Jose, when he asked her "באיזו דרך נלך ללוד" ("By which way do we go to Lod?") claiming that he could have said the same thing in two Hebrew words, "באיזה ללוד" ("By which to Lod?") instead of four, and thereby keep to the Talmudic injunction not to speak to women unnecessarily. 
In the Midrash on Psalms 118 it states that Bruriah taught her husband, Rabbi Meir, to pray for the repentance of the wicked, rather than for their destruction. According to the story, she once found Rabbi Meir praying that an annoying neighbor would die. Appalled by this, she responded to him by explaining the verse "Let the sinners be consumed from the earth, and the wicked shall be no more" ([tpl]bibleverse|Psalms||104:35|HE[/tpl]), that the verse actually states: "Let sin be consumed from the earth," adding that "the wicked shall be no more" because they have repented. Another interpretation of the passage, one that fits with the Masoretic vocalization, suggests that Bruriah explained that the verse does not refer to "those who sin" (as a participle), but habitual "sinners" (as an agent noun).
She is also described as having enormous inner strength. The Midrash on the Book of Proverbs tells that her two sons died suddenly on the Sabbath, but she hid the fact from her husband until she could tell him in a way that would comfort him. In response, Rabbi Meir quoted the verse, "A woman of valour, who can find?" ([tpl]bibleverse|Proverbs||31:10|HE[/tpl]).

Whiplash released two further albums, Cult of One and Sit, Stand, Kneel, Prey before the three Tonys recorded a final album together in 1998, Thrashback.

As commonly reported in many interviews, Mick Jones, the founding member, lead guitarist, and main songwriter of Foreigner was at home recovering from having the flu. Mick was in the process of listening to audition tapes of various singers to replace the newly departed Lou Gramm when he came upon a cassette of Johnny Edwards. Upon hearing the demo tape, Mick immediately jumped out of bed and shouted out, "This is it!", referring to Edwards' voice as the perfect replacement for Lou.  Released on June 14, 1991, Foreigner's new album, Unusual Heat had 11 songs in total, and 10 of these were the combination of mainstay Mick, Johnny and co-producer, Terry Thomas, who had previously worked with Bad Company's lead vocalist, Brian Howe, on their last 3 albums as producer and songwriter.
In addition to providing lead vocals, Edwards was also an accomplished guitarist who not only added rhythm guitar but also played the lead guitar in the song "Mountain of Love", the fifth track on the Unusual Heat album. The Billboard 200 documented Unusual Heat at #117 on August 3, 1991. The album's first single, "Lowdown and Dirty" was included on the band's Rhino double-CD retrospective Juke Box Heroes. Although Edwards received some critical acclaim for his live performances and vocal style, Unusual Heat was a commercial failure, and Lou Gramm returned the following year, effectively ending Edwards' tenure as Foreigner's front-man. In 1992, The Reunited Gramm & Foreigner Founder, Mick Jones released ' The Very Best & Beyond ' with three new songs. 1 of the tracks " With Heaven On Our Side" was co-written by Johnny Edwards. who departed earlier that year after a two year reign as lead singer.
Edwards quit the music business several years ago to raise a family with his wife. They have two children. 
In an interview snippet from March 2004 JK Jeff Northrup, Edwards old band-mate & Friend, received a "Major" offer to record a new rock album with Edwards at the vocal helm but, Johnny turned it down as he was happy in life outside music. However, even after vocalist Paul Shortino was brought in, Edwards still contributed song-writing & co-lead vocals for two tracks. 
Edwards and Jeff "JK" Northrup also can be heard playing and singing together  on two compilation Rock albums compiled and released by  Australian Website and Record Label www.Melodicrock.com. 
Edwards is also an activist for peace and racial equality. His parents, Jean and George Edwards (a retired professor of theology and Presbyterian minister) of Louisville, Kentucky, are pacifists and civil rights activists who influenced Johnny to have as much contact with African-Americans as possible.
Johnny Edwards is now living a comfortable life in Louisville with his wife and two children.

Semantic differential is a type of a rating scale designed to measure the connotative meaning of objects, events, and concepts. The connotations are used to derive the attitude towards the given object, event or concept.
Osgood's semantic differential was an application of his more general attempt to measure the semantics or meaning of words, particularly adjectives, and their referent concepts. The respondent is asked to choose where his or her position lies, on a scale between two bipolar adjectives (for example: "Adequate-Inadequate", "Good-Evil" or "Valuable-Worthless"). Semantic differentials can be used to measure opinions, attitudes and values on a psychometrically controlled scale.

[[Geolocation]]
CATEGORIES: Internet privacy, Geolocation, Radio-frequency identification

Geolocation is the identification of the real-world geographic location of an object, such as a radar, mobile phone or an Internet-connected computer terminal.  Geolocation may refer to the practice of assessing the location, or to the actual assessed location.  Geolocation is closely related to the use of positioning systems but can be distinguished from it by a greater emphasis on determining a meaningful location (e.g. a street address) rather than just a set of geographic coordinates. 
For either geolocating or positioning, the locating engine often uses radio frequency (RF) location methods, for example Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) for precision. TDOA systems often utilise mapping displays or other geographic information system. This is in contrast to earlier radiolocation technologies, for example Direction Finding where a line of bearing to a transmitter is achieved as part of the process.
Internet and computer geolocation can be performed by associating a geographic location with the Internet Protocol (IP) address, MAC address, RFID, hardware embedded article/production number, embedded software number (such as UUID, Exif/IPTC/XMP or modern steganography), invoice, Wi-Fi positioning system, or device GPS coordinates, or other, perhaps self-disclosed information. Geolocation usually works by automatically looking up an IP address on a WHOIS service and retrieving the registrant's physical address.[tpl]cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1433634 |author=Kevin F.

The word geolocation is also used in other contexts to refer to the process of inferring the location of a tracked animal based, for instance, on the time history of sunlight brightness or the water temperature and depth measured by an instrument attached to the animal. Such instruments are commonly called archival tags or dataloggers.
The word geolocation is also the latitude and longitude coordinates of a particular location. Term and definition standardized by ISO/IEC 19762-5:2008.

[[Neurophilosophy]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy by field, Philosophy of mind, Philosophy of science, Analytic philosophy, Cognitive neuroscience

Neurophilosophy or philosophy of neuroscience is the interdisciplinary study of neuroscience and philosophy that explores the relevance of neuroscientific studies to the arguments traditionally categorized as philosophy of mind. The philosophy of neuroscience attempts to clarify neuroscientific methods and results using the conceptual rigor and methods of philosophy of science.
While the issue of brain-mind is still open for debate, from the perspective of neurophilosophy, an understanding of the philosophical applications of neuroscience discoveries is nevertheless relevant. Even if neuroscience eventually found that there is no causal relationship between brain and mind, the mind would still remain an epiphenomenon of the brain, and as such neuroscience would still be relevant for the philosophy of the mind. At the other end of the spectrum, if neuroscience will eventually demonstrate a perfect overlap between brain and mind phenomena, neuroscience would become indispensable for the study of the mind. Clearly, regardless of the status of the brain-mind debate, the study of neuroscience is relevant for philosophy.

CATEGORIES: Lindy Hop, Line dances

The Tranky Doo is a Jazz Dance choreography. It was choreographed by Pepsi Bethel and first appeared at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem during the 1940s[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] .
At that time, it was danced to Tuxedo Junction, however many modern day performances of the dance use other swing jazz songs. It is most common these days to perform the dance with the song "Dipsy Doodle" by Ella Fitzgerald because the dance appears in the Spirit Moves documentary film with a playback of the song. However the film originally had no sound, and the song "Dipsy Doodle" was artificially superimposed on that section of the film.
It was common to Lindy Hoppers, like the Shim Sham.

The structural differential is a physical chart or three-dimensional model illustrating the abstracting processes of the human nervous system. In one form, it looks like a pegboard with tags. Created by Alfred Korzybski, and awarded a U.S. patent on May 26, 1925, it is used as a training device in general semantics. The device is intended to show that human "knowledge" of, or acquaintance with, anything is partial—not total.

Greece was the host nation of the 1896 Summer Olympics held in Athens.  The number of Greek contestants is commonly cited as 169, but as many as 176 GreeksThe names of 103 competitors are known.  Up to 7 unknown swimmers, 22 unknown shooters, and 44 unknown gymnasts competed for a total of 176.  Most historians reduce the number of swimmers to 6 unknowns, saying that two of the entries were by the same swimmer, as well as noting that the 104 known competitors include three gymnasts who probably were among the 44 unnamed competitors in the team event.  These two changes reduce the total competitors to 172.  A comparison of Mallon's tables of multiple-event athletes indicates that he believes 3 of the unknown gymnasts also competed in other sports, reducing the number further to 169, which is the number he uses for Greece, Smyrna and Cyprus. contested events in all nine sports.  The Greeks were by far the most successful nation in terms of total medals with 46, 26 more than the United States of America.

Raymond William Price (born 12 June, 1976) is a former Zimbabwean cricketer. He bowls left-arm orthodox spin. He is the nephew of the renowned Zimbabwean golfer Nick Price.
Price was born two months prematurely and contracted meningitis when he was a few months old. He was given only a one in four chance of survival, but survive he did. However, although it was not realised for some time, he was left totally deaf by the disease. When he was four, he had an operation to regain his hearing. The operation was successful, but left him with terrible coordination difficulties. He was consequently some way behind his age group when he went to school.
Price first played cricket with friends in his back garden. When he was at primary school he was a pace bowler, but took up spin at Watershed College, a boarding school near Marondera. He gradually got better and better at cricket, ending up as a key figure for the school team.
He had attracted the attention of the Mashonaland County Districts cricket side, and he made his first-class debut in 1995/6, although only as an amateur. He was a trained installer of refrigeration and air conditioning units during this period of his career.
Price began to impress the Zimbabwe selectors and, when an injury and form crisis robbed Zimbabwe of the first-choice spinner Paul Strang, Adam Huckle and Andy Whittall, they selected him for the third Test of the series against Sri Lanka in 1999/2000.
He became a marginal figure in the squad, sometimes he played and sometimes he did not, however in 2001/02 he began to put in some good performances for the national side, including 5–181, his first Test five wicket haul, against South Africa at Bulawayo and 4–116 against Pakistan at the same ground.
In 2003 Price toured England and impressed everyone who saw him bowl. He was rated as a better spinner than the English spinner Ashley Giles.The Zimbabweans Lost To Politics XI[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] It was in that winter's tour of Australia, however, that Ray truly established himself as a world-class bowler, taking 6–121 in the second Test at Sydney. Against the West Indies back home that winter Price ran through their strong batting line-up twice, taking 6–73 and 4–88 in the first Test at Harare and then again in Bulawayo, taking 5–119 and 4–36. He played a pivotal role in Zimbabwe's series win over Bangladesh that winter too, taking 8 wickets in two Tests. He was becoming disaffected with the politicisation of Zimbabwean cricket however, and in 2004 he joined the player rebellion led by captain Heath Streak. Soon afterwards he signed for Worcestershire and announced an ambition to play for England.
Price has built up a devoted following among supporters of other counties. His appearance at the 2005 Bath Festival was met with jubilation by his fans as they chanted his name throughout the day. His clever left arm spin bamboozled Somerset that day as 'Ray's Barmy Army' went through a selection of pop hits based on the popular Zimbabwe international.
In 2006 Price revealed to the Press Association that he hoped to play international cricket again – for England after the required qualification period.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/250497.html |title=Price sets sights on England |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-07[/tpl]
In 2007 he made a surprise return to Zimbabwe, and played in several National League matches for Old Hararians. Some believed this may have been a hint to the national selectors, with the 2007 World Cup approaching. However, he was not selected for the Zimbabwe squad.
Price rejected a one-year contract with Worcestershire at the end of the 2007 season, ending his three and a half-year spell at the club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/countycricket2007/content/story/312977.html |title=Price rejects new Worcestershire contract |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-07[/tpl]
In late 2007, he officially returned to the Zimbabwe team. He was selected for the Zimbabwe squad to play the West Indies. Ever since, he has been a regular and influential member of the team, used to dry up runs and to take crucial wickets. He has been one of many rebel cricketers who have returned due to the improving situation in Zimbabwe. He has had a superb comeback to the Zimbabwe cricket team, rising to 3rd in the ICC Cricket ODI Bowling Rankings, taking 45 wickets in just 27 matches, while bowling very economically. He played in all ODIs for Zimbabwe in 2009, against the South Africa cricket team, the Bangladesh cricket team, the Sri Lanka cricket team and the Kenya cricket team. Price was unsold at the original IPL 2011 player auction in January and Mumbai Indians bought him at his reserve price of $50,000, in place of the injured Moises Henriques. He became only the second Zimbabwean to play in the IPL.[tpl]cite news|last=Staff|first=ESPNCricinfo|title=Ray Price to play for Mumbai Indians at $50,000|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2011/content/story/512305.html|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=ESPNCricinfo|date=23 April 2011[/tpl]
Later in 2011, Price was selected to play in all three of Zimbabwe's one-off Tests against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand, after Zimbabwe's five-year hiatus from Test cricket. He took ten wickets over the three matches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/55698.html?class=1;template=results;type=allround;view=match|title=Statistics / Statsguru / RW Price / Test matches|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=14 January 2012[/tpl]

He played for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). However, he spent most of his playing career in the minor leagues. Following his playing career, he went into coaching, spending 13 years coaching in the minor leagues before making it to the NHL. As an NHL head coach, Shero won the Stanley Cup twice with the Philadelphia Flyers (1974 and 1975) and reached the Stanley Cup Finals three times in Philadelphia (1974, 1975, and 1976). He also had four consecutive seasons of having a 0.700 or better winning percentage and remains the Flyers all-time leader in coaching victories. Shero controversially left the Flyers following the 1977–78 season to become the head coach of the New York Rangers, whom he led to the Stanley Cup Finals in his first season. He resigned from the Rangers after coaching for less than three seasons. Shero had a unique style of coaching that led to several innovations that are still used today. He was the first coach to hire a full-time assistant coach, employ systems, have his players use in season strength training, study film, and he was one of the first coaches to utilize a morning skate. In 2013 Shero was recognized for his contributions when he was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder.
He was known for his enigmatic and introverted personality often appearing or disappearing from a room unnoticed, or being completely lost in thought. He often left philosophical sayings on a chalkboard as a way of provoking thought or as a motivational tool. Prior to game six of the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals, Shero wrote his now famous quote "Win today and we walk together forever" - a statement that continues to be quoted to this day. His son, Ray Shero, also pursued a career in hockey and is the current general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

The Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site, also known as the Vassall-Craigie-Longfellow House and, until December 2010, Longfellow National Historic Site, is a historic site located at 105 Brattle Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For almost fifty years, it was the home of noted American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. For a time, it had previously served as the headquarters of George Washington.
The house was built in 1759 for John Vassall, who fled the Cambridge area at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War because of his loyalty to the king of England. On July 16, 1775, George Washington occupied the abandoned house as his first official headquarters. It served as his base of operations during the Siege of Boston, until he moved out on April 4, 1776. Andrew Craigie, Washington's Apothecary General, was the next person to own the home for a significant period of time. After purchasing the house in 1791, he instigated the home's only major addition. Craigie's financial situation at the time of his death in 1819 forced his widow Elizabeth Craigie to take in boarders. It was as a boarder that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow came into the home. He became its owner in 1843, when his father-in-law Nathan Appleton purchased it as a wedding gift. He lived in the home until his death in 1882.
The last family to live in the home was the Longfellow family, who established the Longfellow Trust in 1913 for its preservation. In 1972, the home and all of its furnishings was donated to, and was made part of, the National Park Service. The home, which represents the mid-Georgian architectural style, is seasonally open to the public.

The Oval is a football stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland, which has been home to Glentoran F.C. since 1892. It was given to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast. The Oval was bombed during the Belfast blitz of World War II, and was out of use until 1949 when it was rebuilt with assistance from Cliftonville and Distillery. It had a new stand built in 2000 but requires consistent maintenance to fulfill health and safety requirements and its capacity is currently restricted to 5,056. The Oval has occasionally hosted the final of the Irish Cup as well as hosting the final of the County Antrim Shield and the Setanta Cup.

Michael Rasmussen (born 1 June 1974) is a retired Danish professional bicycle racer, who competed in road racing and mountain biking. His most notable victories include four stages of the Tour de France, one stage of the Vuelta a España and a win on the Italian classic Giro dell'Emilia in 2002. He also won the best climber classification in the 2005 and 2006 Tour de France. His nickname in Danish is Kyllingen ([tpl]lang-en|The Chicken[/tpl]), originating from his period as a mountain biker when teammates were watching the Danish children's TV show Bamses Billedbog, about a bear and a chicken. A large team mechanic was nicknamed Bear, and so Rasmussen was dubbed The Chicken.Anthony Tan, To Rule the Roost, CyclingNews.com, 10 July 2004
Specializing in climbing, Rasmussen showed a propensity for attempting spectacular wins in mountain stages in which he broke away from the peloton early and rode alone for most of the stage. Michael Rasmussen was known for his care for detail when considering weight. With a low weight (60 kg) he was usually one of the lightest riders in his class. He was known for peeling off unnecessary stickers from his bike, not wearing the Livestrong wristband which was common among many Tour de France riders, due to the additional grams. He used to count each grain of rice before eating and had water with his breakfast cereal, instead of milk. He only carried one water bottle holder and his Colnago Extreme-C bike weighed 6.81 kg,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] only 10 g more than the minimum limit.UCI Cycling Regulations[tpl]dead link|date=October 2008[/tpl] p. 61
In the 2007 Tour de France, Rasmussen, while wearing the yellow jersey and well on his way to winning the Tour, had his contract terminated by his team and was removed from the Tour. He served a two-year ban from July 2007 to July 2009 for lying about his whereabouts. On a press conference on 31 January 2013, Rasmussen admitted that he had used performance-enhancing drugs and methods, including EPO, growth hormones, insulin, testosterone, DHEA, IGF-1, cortisone and blood doping, for most of his professional career.[ref]

[[Mighty Force Records]]

CATEGORIES: British record labels, Record labels established in 1990, Record labels disestablished in 1998, Techno record labels

Mighty Force Records was a record shop and influential early techno label based in Exeter, Devon, South West England between 1990-1995. It was founded by ex-punk, ex-free festival activist (having briefly worked with the Stonehenge Free Festival Campaign in 1983) and ex-warehouse party organiser Mark Darby and his partner, journalist Jess Shortis after they had visited various club-based events in Plymouth and realised there was no focal point for the burgeoning rave scene in Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. 
The store soon became a regular stop-off point for many internationally known DJs including, Sasha, Andrew Weatherall, Lee Burridge, Jon DaSilva and Felix Buxton later of Basement Jaxx and was the catalyst for the fledgling West Country techno movement.
The record label is best known for releasing Analogue Bubblebath and other works by the Aphex Twin, and works of Tom Middleton later of Global Communication, Jedi Knights, Cosmos and AMBA. Later releases included Middleton's own "My Splendid Idea" and the hard to find Fog City EP by Darby and Matthew Herbert.
Middleton, his Global Communication and Jedi Knights partner Mark Pritchard and Herbert met through the patronage of the Mighty Force store. All three also DJ'ed regularly at the weekly promotional club night run by the label along with the likes of Weatherall, Judge Jules and ex-Haçienda resident Graeme Park. Another regular DJ at these events was Dominic Jacobson then studying at Exeter University, later a member of Phil Asher's Restless Soul crew and who now produces deep jazz inflected house under the name Modaji and Harvey Lindo. Middleton and Jacobson were often to be seen working behind the shop counter.
Although the store ceased to trade in 1995, the label relocated to London and continued to release music by deep house artists such as Peach Palf and the Classic / Music For Freaks recording artists, Luke Solomon and Justin Harris under the alias Robotic Movement until 1998. Label design was by Ben Drury, known for his innovative work with James Lavelle's Mo' Wax label and collaborations with former graffiti artist and The Clash's sometime sleeve designer, Futura 2000.
Other releases included a series of white label breakbeat EPs under the name of Old Skool Flava, nominally produced by Darby and "H" Warren, label manager of Global Communication's now defunct Universal Language Productions imprint.
Darby's connections with the early Eighties festival scene and involvement in organising free acid house parties centered around Pepper Box Hill near Salisbury in Wiltshire in the latter part of that decade - especially a joint event at that location in August 1989 - led to an informal partnership between a DJ and sound system collective based around the shop and Nottingham's The DiY Sound System, with whom they collaborated to stage many free parties throughout the South West during the early to mid 1990s.

[[Neoevolutionism]]
CATEGORIES: Anthropology, Sociological theories, Theories of history, Sociocultural evolution

Neoevolutionism is a social theory that tries to explain the evolution of societies by drawing on Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and discarding some dogmas of the previous social evolutionism. Neoevolutionism is concerned with long-term, directional, evolutionary social change and with the regular patterns of development that may be seen in unrelated, widely separated cultures.
Neoevolutionism emerged in the 1930s. It developed extensively in the period after the Second World War -- and was incorporated into anthropology as well as sociology in the 1960s.
Its theories are based on empirical evidence from fields such as archeology, paleontology, and historiography. Proponents say neoevolutionism is objective and simply descriptive, eliminating any references to a moral or cultural system of values.
While the 19th century evolutionism explained how culture develops by giving general principles of its evolutionary process, it was dismissed by Historical Particularism as unscientific in the early 20th century. It was the neoevolutionary thinkers who brought back evolutionary thought and developed it to be acceptable to contemporary anthropology.
The neoevolutionism discards many ideas of classical social evolutionism, namely that of social progress, so dominant in previous sociology evolution-related theories. Then neoevolutionism discards the determinism argument and introduces probability, arguing that accidents and free will have much impact on the process of social evolution. It also supports the counterfactual history - asking 'what if' and considering different possible paths that social evolution may (or might have) taken, and thus allows for the fact that various cultures may develop in different ways, some skipping entire stages others have passed through. The neoevolutionism stresses the importance of empirical evidence. While 19th century evolutionism used value judgment and assumptions for interpreting data, the neoevolutionism relied on measurable information for analyzing the process of cultural evolution.
Neoevolutionism important thinkers include:

Denge is a former Royal Air Force site near Dungeness, in Kent, England. It is best known for the early experimental acoustic mirrors which remain there.
The acoustic mirrors, known colloquially as 'listening ears', at Denge are located between Greatstone-on-Sea and Lydd airfield, on the banks of a now disused gravel pit. The mirrors were built in the late 1920s and early 1930s as an experimental early warning system for incoming aircraft, developed by Dr William Sansome Tucker. Several were built along the south and east coasts, but the complex at Denge is the best preserved.

Jennifer Rosanne States was a black Canadian child who died at age three in September 1968 and made national headlines when she was refused burial in an all-white cemetery.
States had been very ill from soon after birth. Her parents, with six other young children, were unable to care for her and sent her to a white foster family in Windsor, Nova Scotia. When she died this family tried to have her buried in the St. Croix Cemetery. However, the managing board cited a 1907 bylaw banning blacks and natives from the cemetery. States was instead buried in a traditionally black cemetery nearby. The incident came to the attention of the national media and caused a general outcry. The cemetery board quickly backed down and deleted the offending bylaw.

The New Town ([tpl]lang-cs|Nové Město[/tpl]) is a quarter in the city of Prague in the Czech Republic. New Town is the youngest and largest of the five independent (from the Middle Ages until 1784) towns that today comprise the historic center of modern Prague. New Town was founded in 1348 by Charles IV just outside the city walls to the east and south of the Old Town and encompassed an area of 7.5 km²; about three times the size of the Old Town. The population of Prague in 1378 was well over 40,000, perhaps as much as twice that, making it the 4th most populated city north of the Alps and, by area, the 3rd largest city in Europe. Although New Town can trace its current layout to its construction in the 14th century, only few churches and administrative buildings from this time survive. There are many secular and educational buildings in New Town, but also especially magnificent gothic and baroque churches. These nevertheless are not the main drawing points for tourists. New Town's most famous landmark is Wenceslas Square, which was originally built as a horsemarket and now functions as a center of commerce and tourism. In the 15th century, the Novoměstská radnice, or New Town Hall, was the site of the first of the three defenestrations of Prague.

[tpl]legend|Red|outline=#aaaaaa|Mainly Brittonic areas[/tpl]]]
The Britons (sometimes Brythons or British people) were the people who spoke the Insular Celtic language known as Common Brittonic. They lived in Great Britain during the Iron Age, the Roman era and the post-Roman era. After the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons the population was either subsumed into Anglo-Saxon culture, becoming "English"; retreated; or persisted in the Celtic fringe areas of Wales, Cornwall and southern Scotland, with some emigrating to Brittany. The relationship of the Britons to the Picts north of the Forth has been the subject of much discussion, though most scholars accept that the Pictish language during this time was a branch of Common Brittonic.Forsyth, p. 9.
The Romano-British population apparently mostly continued to speak Brittonic languages throughout the occupation, although the great majority of surviving inscriptions use Latin, and we have little evidence as to how local and international languages co-existed in Romano-British society.  At the end of Roman Britain, the Britons lived throughout Britain south of the Firth of Forth. After the 5th century, under the pressure of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, Britons migrated to mainland Europe and established significant settlements in Brittany (today part of France), with a smaller migration to Britonia in modern Galicia, Spain.Koch, pp. 291–292.
The earliest evidence for the Britons and their language in historical sources dates to the Iron Age, however it seems increasingly likely that the majority of the population represented a continuity with the preceding British Bronze Age; "Briton" is also a term used for the earlier inhabitants.  After the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century, a Romano-British culture began to emerge. With the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement in the 5th century, however, the culture and language of the Britons began to fragment and much of their territory was taken over by the Anglo-Saxons. The extent to which this cultural and linguistic change was accompanied by wholesale changes in the population is still a matter of discussion.  By the 11th century remaining Celtic-speaking populations had split into distinct groups: the Welsh, Cornish, Bretons, and the people of the Hen Ogledd ("Old North"). Common Brittonic developed into two main groups: the Western Brittonic languages, including Welsh and Cumbric, and the Southwestern Brittonic languages, comprising Cornish and Breton.

[[Sequah Medicine Company]]

CATEGORIES: Companies established in 1887, Companies disestablished in 1909, Patent medicines

Sequah Medicine Company began in 1887 as the Sequah Medicine Co Ltd selling patent medicines such as prairie flower and Indian oil using traveling salesman, known as Sequahs.  The traveling salesmen were quack doctors.  One such example is Peter Alexander Gordon, who went under the pseudonym James Kaspar.  Gordon sold the Sequah Patent Medicine in Great Britain, Ireland, the West Indies and North America.
Sequah products were sold using the device of a traveling medicine show.  These shows consisted of a warm-up act of music and other entertainments which attracted a crowd in order for the traveling salesman to begin his pitch.  The British version, introduced in 1890, was made up of a fairground steam organ.  The Government soon declared the practice of selling patent medicines in such a fashion illegal.  The company went into liquidation in 1895 and was liquidated on March 26, 1909.[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=kmgW9kCwiWwC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=%22sequah+medicine+company%22&source=web&ots=YnUsneQY1I&sig=k2bjZOBNc_Ff7wKbYuKd7VVu9Oo#PPP9,M1 |title= The Excruciating History of Dentistry |accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |work= |publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |location= |isbn= 0-312-26319-8 |pages= |first= James | last= Wynbrandt[/tpl]

Todd Strange (born January 31, 1966) is the bassist who played on the first Down album NOLA and with Crowbar. Forming Crowbar with Kirk Windstein (Down), Matt Thomas and Craig Nunenmacher (Black Label Society), they released the best-selling albums of the band's discography. This included the Crowbar self-titled LP with the hits "All I Had (I Gave)", "Existence is Punishment", "No Quarter" (by Led Zeppelin) and "I Have Failed", produced by Phil Anselmo. By 1994, Phil put his band Pantera to the side and resurrected Down which was sidelined for Pantera in the late 1990s. The band released NOLA in reference to the band's hometown, New Orleans, Louisiana, and played 13 shows. Eventually, the album sold 500,000 copies and was certified Gold by the RIAA. Soon after, Phil returned to Pantera and Crowbar continued, and the two bands partnered up for tours in 1996. As a result, Todd, Kirk and the rest of Crowbar appear in Pantera's "Home Videos 3" in the credits, and Kirk and the band are seen in scenes including the notorious clip of Kirk dressed up as the Hulk. This event is also included in Crowbar's 1996 home video "Like Broken", but contains slightly different footage. 
By the time Down reformed and Crowbar recorded "Sonic Excess in its Purest Form", Todd dropped completely out of music. He is currently working as a machine repair tech in River Ridge, Louisiana. Kirk Windstein played bass during the studio recording of NOLA, with Todd taking the role as live bass player.

thumb|125px|Coat of arms of the counts of Perche.John II of Alençon (2 March 1409, Château d'Argentan – 8 September 1476, Paris) was the son of John I of Alençon and his wife Marie of Brittany, Lady of La Guerche (1391–1446), daughter of John V, Duke of Brittany and Joan of Navarre. He succeeded his father as Duke of Alençon and Count of Perche as a minor in 1415, after the latter's death at the Battle of Agincourt. He is best known as a general in the Last Phase of the Hundred Years' War and for his role as a comrade-in-arms of Joan of Arc, who called him "le beau duc" ("the fair duke"/"the gentle duke").
He saw action at the age of fifteen at the Battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424, and was captured by the English. He was held prisoner until 1429 at Le Crotoy, paying 200,000 saluts d'or for his ransom. He sold all he possessed to the English, and his fief of Fougères to the Duke of Brittany. After Alençon's capture, the Duke of Bedford, regent of Henry VI, took control of his duchy. He would not regain Alençon until 1449, but remained the titular duke in the eyes of the French crown. When he left prison, Jean d'Alençon was called "the poorest man in France".
Before his capture at Verneuil, he had married in 1424, at the Chateau de Blois, Jeanne of Valois, daughter of Charles, duc d'Orléans and Isabella of Valois, but she died in Angers in 1432, having given him no children.
In April 1429, not long after his release, the duke heard about Joan of Arc, who had come to Charles VII at Chinon, promising to liberate France from the English, asking that he send her with an army to lift the Siege of Orléans. Alençon came eagerly to Chinon and very quickly became her good friend and most prominent supporter among the princes of the blood. He accompanied her to Orléans, where he became the official commander of the French army there and played a major role in Joan's decisive victory against the English alongside Jean de Dunois and La Hire among others. He then joined her in the liberation of the rest of the Loire Valley. He left to fight elsewhere after the end of the campaign in September 1429, preferring to attack the English around his own domains in Normandy. Upon Joan's martyrdom on 30 May 1431, when she was burnt at the stake by the English at Rouen, Alençon was one of the people most devastated by the loss.
On 30 April 1437, at the Chateau L'Isle-Jourdain, he married Marie of Armagnac (c. 1420 – 25 July 1473, Cloister Mortagne-au-Perche), daughter of Jean IV of Armagnac.
John was discontented with the Treaty of Arras, having hoped to make good his poverty through the spoliation of the Burgundians. He fell out with Charles VII, and took part in a revolt in 1439–40, (the Praguerie) but was forgiven, having been a lifelong friend of the king. He took part in the invasion of Normandy in 1449, but he had unwisely entered into correspondence with the English since 1440. (He had also accepted the Order of the Golden Fleece at this time.) Shortly after testifying at the "rehabilitation trial" of Joan of Arc in 1456, he was arrested by Jean de Dunois and imprisoned at Aigues-Mortes. In 1458, he was convicted of  lèse-majesté and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted and he was imprisoned at Loches. He was released by Louis XI upon terms at his accession in 1461, but he refused to keep them and was imprisoned again. He was tried a second time before the Parlement of Paris and sentenced to death again on 18 July 1474, and his Duchy was confiscated. However, the sentence was not carried out, and he died in prison in the Louvre in 1476.
He had two children by his second wife, Marie:
He also had several illegitimate children:

Joseph Henry Nettlefold (19 September 1827 – 22 November 1881) was a British industrialist, the Nettlefold in Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds.
He was born in London to John Sutton Nettlefold who, in 1854, dispatched him to manage the business of Nettlefold and Chamberlain in Birmingham with his brother Edward John and cousin Joseph Chamberlain. The Chamberlains left the firm in 1874 and Edward John died in 1878, leaving effective control of Birmingham manufacturing and engineering to Joseph, and his younger brother Frederick Nettlefold as chairman in London. Nettlefolds Ltd was launched as a limited company in 1880 and Nettlefold, by a series of astute mergers and acquisitions, went on to establish a virtual monopoly in the British wood-screw market.
Nettlefold was a sober man whose principal interests were technical. He became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1860.
Though both his parents were Unitarian, Nettlefold married a Roman Catholic, Mary Maria Seaborne (born 1835), in 1867. None of their three daughters went on to have any connection with the family business.
Joseph died of apoplexy at his Scottish residence, Allean House, near Pitlochry, Perthshire. He bequeathed several paintings by David Cox to the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, on condition that it open on Sundays. He left a further £1000 to the King's Heath and Moseley Institute.
Sometime after Nettlefold's death, Nettlefold & Co. was acquired by Arthur Keen's Guest, Keen & Co. to create Guest, Keen and Nettlefold which is, [tpl]As of|2007|lc=on[/tpl], still trading. For many years, this company has been better known as GKN plc

[[History of the alphabet]]
CATEGORIES: Alphabets, History of writing

The history of alphabetic writing goes back to the consonantal writing system used for Semitic languages in the Levant in the 2nd millennium B.C. Most or nearly all alphabetic scripts used throughout the world today ultimately go back to this Semitic proto-alphabet.[tpl]cite book|last=Sampson|first=Geoffrey|title=Writing systems: a linguistic introduction|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1985|page=77[/tpl] Its first origins can be traced back to a Proto-Sinaitic script developed in Ancient Egypt to represent the language of Semitic-speaking workers in Egypt. This script was partly influenced by the older Egyptian hieratic, a cursive script related to Egyptian hieroglyphs.Himelfarb, Elizabeth J. "First Alphabet Found in Egypt", Archaeology 53, Issue 1 (Jan./Feb. 2000): 21.[tpl]cite journal|last=Goldwasser|first=Orly|authorlink=Orly Goldwasser|title=How the Alphabet Was Born from Hieroglyphs|journal=Biblical Archaeology Review|volume=36|issue=1|pages=|publisher=Biblical Archaeology Society|location=Washington, DC|date=Mar–Apr 2010|url=http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=36&Issue=02&ArticleID=06|issn=0098-9444|accessdate=6 Nov 2011[/tpl]
Mainly through Phoenician and Aramaic, two closely related members of the Semitic family of scripts that were in use during the early first millennium BC, the Semitic alphabet became the ancestor of multiple writing systems across the Middle East, Europe, northern Africa and South Asia.
Some modern authors distinguish between consonantal scripts of the Semitic type, called "abjads", and "true alphabets" in the narrow sense,[tpl]cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1=Daniels|first1=Peter T|last2=Bright|first2=William|year=1996|title=The World's Writing Systems|publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl] the distinguishing criterion being that true alphabets consistently assign letters to both consonants and vowels on an equal basis, while in an abjad each symbol usually stands for a consonant. In this sense, the first true alphabet was the Greek alphabet, which was adapted from the Phoenician. Latin, the most widely used alphabet today,[tpl]harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96[/tpl] in turn derives from the Greek.
West Semitic people from the eastern coast of the Mediterranean (where Phoenician and Hebrew groups lived) are usually credited with developing the world's first alphabet. It was a short, 22-character list with (1)names and (2)a fixed order for characters that could (3)easily be memorized. This "alphabet" was spread by Phoenician traders and then modified by the inclusion of vowels, by the Greeks, whose first 2 letters, alpha and beta were put together to form the name "alphabet."

Charles IV of Alençon (1489, Alençon –1525, Lyon) was the son of René of Alençon and the Blessed Margaret of Vaudémont.
He succeeded his father in 1492 as Duke of Alençon and Count of Perche, and was also Count of Armagnac, Fézensac, Viscount of Rodez, Count of Fezensaguet, l'Isle-Jourdain, and Perdiac.
In 1509 he married Margaret of Angoulême, sister to Francis, Duke of Valois, who would in 1515 become King Francis I of France. Their marriage was childless: his wife was allowed to retain most of his titles.
As first prince of the blood, Charles was a prominent figure in the early part of his brother-in-law's reign.  He fought at Marignano in 1515, and in 1521 defended Champagne against an imperial invasion.  He accompanied his brother-in-law on his second expedition to Italy in 1525, and after the disaster at Pavia, took command of the defeated French forces, leading them in retreat back to French territory.  He was made a scapegoat for the defeat and accused of abandoning the king, and died soon after.  Although Charles had a sister, Françoise, who survived him, his widow took possession of his lands after his death.

[[Denver Center for the Performing Arts]]
CATEGORIES: Theatre in Colorado, Regional theatre in the United States, Organizations based in Denver, Colorado

The Denver Center for the Performing Arts (DCPA) is an organization in Denver, Colorado which provides a showcase for live theatre, a nurturing ground for new plays, a preferred stop on the Broadway touring circuit, acting classes for the community and rental facilities. It was founded in 1972 and dedicated to excellence in the arts.
The Denver Center for the Performing Arts is the largest tenant of the Denver Performing Arts Complex which is a four-block, [tpl]convert|12|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] site containing ten performance spaces with over 10,000 seats. It is owned and partially operated by Arts and Venues Denver.
Both organizations were the vision of Donald Seawell. Finding himself at 14th and Curtis streets in downtown Denver one day and looking at the old Auditorium Theatre and the surrounding four blocks, Seawell had an idea for a first-class arts complex.  Seawells original vision was much broader and included other entities (see Previous Entities below) which no longer are part of the Center. 
Ground was broken in December 1974. By 1978 Boettcher Concert Hall — the nation's first in-the-round concert hall — was completed, along with an eight-story, 1,700-space parking garage. By 1979 the Auditorium Theatre had been renovated (and was completely renovated again in 2005, creating the state-of-the-art Ellie Caulkins Opera House inside of the historic Auditorium), two cabaret spaces had been added and the Helen G. Bonfils Theatre Complex opened with its four theatres: The Stage, Space, Source (now Jones) and Ricketson. The Temple Hoyne Buell Theatre was completed in 1991, the Seawell Grand Ballroom was added in 1998 and The Conservatory Theatre opened in 2002.

[[Macro-engineering]]

CATEGORIES: Engineering, Macro-engineering

In engineering, macro-engineering (alternatively known as macroengineering or macro engineering and as mega engineering) is the implementation of extremely large-scale design projects. It can be seen as a branch of civil engineering or structural engineering but just on a very large land area. In particular, macro-engineering is the process of marshaling and managing of resources, technology and public opinion on a large scale to carry out complex tasks that last over a long period.
In contrast to conventional engineering projects, macro-engineering projects (called macro-projects or mega-projects) are multidisciplinary, involving collaboration from all fields of study; they involve not only engineers, but scientists, lawyers, industrialists, soldiers and politicians as well. Macro-projects are usually international; they override political boundaries because most countries lack the social, financial or physical ability to undertake them alone. As a consequence, macro-projects have the power to fundamentally transform its area of focus.
Macro-engineering is an evolving field that is only recently receiving attention. Because we routinely deal with challenges that are multinational in scope, such as global warming and pollution, macro-engineering is emerging as a transcendent solution to worldwide problems. Macro-engineering, or mega-engineering, is distinct from megascale engineering which deals with projects on a planetary or stellar scale. Where macro-engineering is currently practical, mega-scale engineering is still within the domain of speculative fiction.

[[Super black]]

CATEGORIES: Materials science, Optics

Super black is a surface treatment developed at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom. It reflects much less light than the darkest conventional matte black paints available previously.
Conventional black paint reflects about 2.5% of the incident light. Super black absorbs approximately 99.6% of light at normal incidence, and only 0.4% is reflected. At other angles of incidence, super black is even more effective. At an angle of 45°, super black reflects 1/25 as much as black paint.
The technique used for super black is based upon chemically etching a nickel–phosphorus alloy.
Applications for super black are in specialist optical instruments to reduce unwanted reflections. The disadvantage of this material is its low optical thickness, as it is a surface treatment. As a result, infrared light of a wavelength longer than a few micrometres penetrates through the dark layer and has much higher reflectivity. The reported spectral dependence increases from about 1% at 3 µm to 50% at 20 µm.
In 2009, a competitor to the super black material was developed based on carbon nanotubes, that has a relatively flat reflectance in a wide spectral range.http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/super-black-material.html
In 2011, NASA and the US Army began funding research in the use of nanotube based super black coatings in sensitive optics.https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/417149
Nanotube based superblack arrays have recently become commercially available. http://www.nano-lab.com/alignedcarbonnanotubearrays.html

Maharees or Magharees ([tpl]Lang-gle|Na Machairí[/tpl]) is a 5 km long ayre located on the northern side of the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland. Fenit Harbour, the main port of County Kerry is sheltered from large Atlantic swells by the Maharees.  To the north of the Maharees lie the Magharee Islands or Seven Hogs, the largest of which, Oileán t-Seanaigh, contains remnants of an early Christian monastic settlement, said to have been founded by St. Senan in the 7th century AD. The peninsula is a sandy spit for much of its length, with sand dunes giving way to earth and rocky ground towards the northern end.  The sand dunes create a unique ecosystem, home to the rare Natterjack toad which is found locally in significant quantities. Lengthy beaches are found on both sides of the peninsula, which separates Brandon Bay on the western side from Tralee Bay to the east. The Brandon Bay beaches are open to the North Atlantic and often receive long rolling swells, which can provide excellent surf given suitable wind and tide conditions. The peninsula is dotted with campgrounds and caravan parks and contains three hamlets Fahamore Kilshannig and Candiha which are home to local pubs and restaurants popular with visitors to the area. Castlegregory Golf and Fishing club is a nine hole links golf course located at the base of the peninsula, a 5 star PADI certified dive centre is located at the fishing harbour at Scraggane BaySeveral windsurfing and surf schools are also located at the beaches on the Maharees. Maheree Island Tours and Angling is also based at Scraggane Pier. Yachting facilities, a marina and a sheltered harbour are located a few miles east at Fenit

AmSouth Bancorporation was a banking company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, and operated for its final year in existence as a bank holding company (subsidiary) of Regions Financial Corporation after a merger between the two banks. AmSouth was previously known as First National Bank of Birmingham, which was first organized by Charles Linn in 1872.  AmSouth was in the financial services industry and at its peak employed over twelve thousand people. 
AmSouth's size more than doubled in 2000 when it absorbed Nashville, Tennessee-based First American National Bank.[tpl]cite news   |title=AmSouth buys First American  |publisher=Birmingham Business Journal  |date=1999-06-04  |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/1999/06/07/tidbits.html?page=1  |accessdate=2007-07-18 [/tpl] With the merger came hundreds of branches primarily in Tennessee but also in Kentucky, Virginia, and Mississippi. This is cited as a rare example of one bank absorbing another bank larger than itself. As part of the deal, AmSouth also acquired Deposit Guaranty Bank (which was operating as a subsidiary of First American). AmSouth was known for its low risk accounts through its specialty in Wealth Management, especially in its largest market of Birmingham, Alabama, where it started its specialty. Following AmSouth's merger with First American in 1999, the company expanded its Wealth Management reach into many of First American's markets such as Nashville, Tennessee.

[[History of South Carolina]]
CATEGORIES: History of South Carolina, History of the Southern United States by state, History of the United States by state

South Carolina is one of the 13 original colonies of the United States. European exploration of the area began in April 1540, with the Hernando de Soto expedition, which led to the introduction of European diseases that decimated the local Indian population.[tpl]cite book|author=Charles Hudson|title=Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun: Hernando de Soto and the South's Ancient Chiefdoms|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vWJnGjxjJk8C|accessdate=February 16, 2012|date=September 1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2062-5|pages=234–238[/tpl] The colony was founded in 1663. The English colony of the Province of Carolina was started in Charleston in 1670, with wealthy planters and their slaves, coming from the British Caribbean colony of Barbados. Colonists overthrew the proprietors after the Yamasee War, pushing back the American Indians in 1715-1717. In 1719 the colony was officially made a crown colony, and North Carolina was split off and made into a separate colony in 1729.
South Carolina  banded together with the other colonies to oppose British taxation in the Stamp Act Crisis of 1765, and played a major role in resisting Britain. It became independent in March 1776 and joined the United States of America.Walter Edgar, Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict that Turned the Tide of the American Revolution (2001) p. 34http://www.nps.gov/revwar/revolution_day_by_day/1776_main.html The Revolution was bloody and hard fought in 1780-81, as the British invaded, captured the American army and were finally driven out.
The cotton gin made the rich soil of the lowlands very profitable for plantations operated by black slaves. The hilly upland areas, with few slaves, were much poorer and a regional conflict underlay the political system.  With outspoken leaders such as John C. Calhoun, the state vied with Virginia as the dominant political and social force in the South. It fought federal tariffs in the 1830s and demanded that its rights to practice slavery be recognized in the territories.  With the 1860 election of Republicans under Abraham Lincoln, who vowed to prevent slavery's expansion, the voters demanded secession. In December 1860, the state seceded from the Union and in February 1861 it joined the new Confederate States of America.
In April 1861 the American Civil War began when Confederate forces attacked the American fort at Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor. The Civil War proved devastating to the whites, but freed the blacks from slavery. From 1865 to 1877, South Carolina underwent Reconstruction. Congress shut down the civilian government in 1867, put the Army in charge, gave Freedmen (freed slaves) the vote and prevented ex-Confederates from holding office. A Republican legislature supported by Freedmen, northern Carpetbaggers and white Southern Scalawags created and funded a public school system, and created social welfare institutions. The constitution they passed was kept nearly unaltered for 27 years, and most legislation passed during the Reconstruction years lasted longer than that. By 1877 the white conservatives, called "Redeemers" had regained political power. In the 1880s Jim Crow laws were passed that were especially severe in the state, to create public segregation and control movement of African American laborers. After 1890 almost all blacks lost their vote, not to regain it until 1965.
The Civil War ruined the economy, making it one of the two or three poorest states for the next century.  Educational levels were low as public schools were underfunded, especially for African Americans. Most people lived on small farms and grew cotton. The more affluent were landowners, who subdivided the land into farms operated by tenant farmers or sharecroppers, along with land operated by the owner using hired labor. Gradually more industry moved into the Piedmont area, with textile factories that turned the state's raw cotton into yarn and cloth for sale on the international market.  Wave after wave of revivals made most people quite religious; most people, white and black alike, were Baptists.
Politically the state was part of the Solid South. Because African Americans were disfranchised by a new state constitution at the end of the nineteenth century, no black officials were elected between 1900 and the late 1960s. Many left the state to go to northern cities during the Great Migration after 1910. Whites rigidly enforced segregation in the Jim Crow era, limiting African Americans' chances for education, representation and free public movement. The federal Civil Rights laws of the 1960s ended segregation and protected the voting rights of African Americans. The blacks had been affiliated with the Republican Party, but after 1964 became intensely loyal Democrats, while most whites moved in the opposite direction.
The cotton regime ended by the 1950s. As factories were built across the state, the great majority of farmers left agriculture. Service industries, such as tourism, education and medical care, grew rapidly, as the textile factories faded after 1970.  By 2000 the white majority of South Carolina voted solidly Republican in presidential elections, but state and local government elections were contested by the two parties. The population continued to grow, reaching 4 million in 2000, as coast areas became prime locations for tourists and retirees. The poverty rate of 13.5% is slightly worse than the national average of 11.7%.

The Liga Nacional de Básquet (abbreviated LNB, and literally in English "National Basketball League") is the top level of the Argentine basketball league system. The league is controlled by the Basketball Clubs' Association (in Spanish: Asociación de Clubes de Básquetbol). The LNB's predecessor is the defunct Campeonato Argentino de Clubes, organized by the Argentine Basketball Federation.
The league was created through the efforts of coach León Najnudel and sports journalist Osvaldo Orcasitas in the 1980s to make Argentine basketball more competitive through the merging of the many existing local leagues.[tpl]cite web |url=http://indeportes.com.ar/basquet/novedades/articulos/1353_lnb-la-historia-de-su-origen.html |title=LNB: la historia de su origen |author=Matías Ron Ares |publisher=In Deportes |language=Spanish |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2010-10-19 [/tpl] It is designed like the NBA, with regular season, all-star game, and playoffs. However, unlike the NBA, the LNB has promotion and relegation with the Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (TNA), the league immediately below.
A tribute to Najnudel's vision is the string of successes of the Argentine national basketball team, culminating with the team's Olympic gold medal won at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and the international careers of many players who started in the league.

Shrubland, scrubland, scrub  or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire.  A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing.  Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term "shrubland" was first coined in 1903.Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition (2003).
Shrubland species generally show a wide range of adaptations to fire, such as heavy seed production, lignotubers, and fire-induced germination.[tpl]cite book|editor=Mares, Michael S.|chapter=Fire|title=Encyclopedia of deserts|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3146-7|page=215|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g3CbqZtaF4oC&pg=PA215[/tpl]

The Audi S6 is the high performance variant of the Audi A6, an executive car produced by German automaker Audi.AudiWorld.com North American S6 Model Guide - historical S6 specifications, prices, and options  It went on sale in 1994, shortly after the "A6" designation was introduced, replacing the "100" nameplate.
The original S6 (Ur-S6) was largely the same car as the outgoing, original Audi S4 (C4) (Ur-S4), with the only visible differences being new body-cladding and badging. In certain markets where the even-higher performance RS6 which is also based on the A6 is not sold, the S6 is the most powerful A6 trim there.
The S6, like all Audi "S" models, is fitted as standard with Audi's trademark quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, the S6 using the Torsen-based permanent 4WD.

The Student Movement Coordination Committee for Democracy in Iran (SMCCDI) is a secularist advocacy group in Iran. It consists mainly of students, or other activists and academics, who support the secularization, democratization, and industrialization of Iran. The group’s members are outside Iran.
The group is non-violent and non-partisan, although certain groups claiming to be affiliated with SMCCDI have caused the harm of SMCCDI activists. The group’s main principal, as described in their charter, is separation of church and state. Other goals include the decentralization of government, separation of political powers, and deregulation of the economy.
SMCCDI is noted for progressist, modernist, classical liberal and economic liberal ideals, such as secularity, democracy, and a free market economy.
The group uses support provided by members of the Iranian diaspora to directly fund its activities, as well as to create satellite TV programs broadcast to Europe, the USA, and Iran.
SMCCDI is headed by Aryo B. Pirouznia.

[[Carbon suboxide]]
CATEGORIES: Oxocarbons

Carbon suboxide, or tricarbon dioxide, is an oxide of carbon with chemical formula C3O2  or O=C=C=C=O.  Its four cumulative double bonds make it a cumulene. It is one of the stable members of the series of linear oxocarbons O=Cn=O, which also includes carbon dioxide (CO2) and pentacarbon dioxide (C5O2).
The substance was discovered in 1873 by Benjamin Brodie by subjecting carbon monoxide to an electric current. He claimed that the product was part of a series of "oxycarbons" with formulas Cx+1Ox, namely C, C2O, C3O2, C4O3, C5O4, ..., and to have identified the last two;[tpl] cite journal | authorlink = Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 2nd Baronet | author = Brodie, B.

[[Bay Bridge Series]]

CATEGORIES: Oakland Athletics, San Francisco Giants, Interleague play, Major League Baseball rivalries

The Bay Bridge Series,  or the Battle of the Bay, is the name of a series of baseball games played between—and the rivalry of—Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics of the American League and San Francisco Giants of the National League. The series takes its name from the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge which links the cities of Oakland and San Francisco. Although competitive, the regional rivalry between the A's and Giants is considered a friendly one with mostly mutual companionship between the fans, as opposed to Cubs–White Sox, or Mets–Yankees games where animosity runs high. Hats displaying both teams on the cap are sold from vendors at the games, and once in a while the teams both dress in uniforms from an historic era of their franchises. The series is also occasionally referred to as the "BART Series" for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system that links Oakland to San Francisco. However, the name "BART Series" has never been popular beyond a small selection of history books and national broadcasters and has fallen out of favor. Bay Area locals almost exclusively refer to the rivalry as the "Bay Bridge Series" of the "Battle of the Bay."
Originally, the term described a series of exhibition games played between the two clubs after the conclusion of spring training, immediately prior to the start of the regular season. It was first used to refer to the 1989 World Series which the Athletics won and the first time both teams had met since they moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, it also refers to games played between the teams during the regular season since the commencement of Interleague play in 1997. Through 2013, the A's have won 50 games, and the Giants have won 46.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head.cgi?teams=OAK&from=1997&to=2012&submit=Submit|work=baseball-reference.com|title=Head-to-Head record for Oakland Athletics against the listed opponents from 1997 to 2013|publisher=Sports Reference LLC[/tpl]

The ten-lined June beetle, also known as the watermelon beetle, is a scarab beetle, living in the western United States and Canada. The adults are attracted to light and feed on foliage but do not damage the plants. They can make a hissing sound when touched or otherwise disturbed, which can resemble the hissing of a bat. This sound is made by their wings pushing down, forcing the air out between their wings and back. They can be an agricultural pest affecting a wide range of crops because their larvae feed on plant roots and can weaken or kill the plants.[tpl]cite web|title=Tenlined June beetle|url=http://jenny.tfrec.wsu.edu/opm/displaySpecies.php?pn=640|work=Orchard Pest Management Online|publisher=Washington State University Tree Fruit Research & Extension Center|accessdate=26 June 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1640s births, 1691 deaths, Royal Horse Guards officers, Williamite military personnel of the Williamite War in Ireland, English generals, Governors of the Dominion of New England, Governors of Tangier

Lieutenant General Percy Kirke (c. 1646 – 1691), English soldier, was the son of George Kirke, a court official to Charles I and Charles II.
In 1666 Kirke obtained his first commission in the Lord Admiral's regiment, and subsequently served in the Blues. In 1673 he was with Monmouth at Maastricht and was present during two campaigns with Turenne on the Rhine.
In 1680 he was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel, and soon afterwards Colonel of the 2nd Tangier Regiment (afterwards the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment). In 1682 he became Governor of Tangier and colonel of the Tangier Regiment (afterwards the Queens Royal West Surrey). He distinguished himself greatly as governor, although he gave offence by the roughness of his manners and the wildness of his life.
On the evacuation of Tangier, Kirke's Lambs (so called from their badge) returned to England, and a year later their colonel served as a brigadier in Feversham's army. After Sedgemoor the rebels were treated with great severity; but the charges so often brought against the Lambs are now known to be exaggerated, though the regiment shared to the full in the ruthless hunting down of the fugitives. It is often stated that it formed Jeffreys' escort in the Bloody Assizes, but this is erroneous.
Kirke was considered by King Charles II as a candidate for governor of the Dominion of New England when it was in the planning stages in the early 1680s.  King James II formalized the appointment, but withdrew the appointment over the controversies surrounding Kirke's role in the suppression of Monmouth's Rebellion.
Brigadier Kirke took a notable part in the Glorious Revolution three years later, and William III promoted him. He commanded at the relief of Derry and made his last campaign in Flanders in 1691.  He also briefly served as MP for West Looe as a Tory in 1689-90.http://www.histparl.ac.uk/volume/1660-1690/member/kirke-percy-1691 History of Parliament Online article by Paula Watson.
He died, with the rank of Lieutenant General, at Brussels in October of that year. His eldest son, Lieutenant General Percy Kirke (1684–1741), was also colonel of the Lambs.

[[Intensity interferometer]]
CATEGORIES: Telescopes, Interferometric telescopes, Quantum optics

An intensity interferometer is the name given to devices that use the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect.  In astronomy, the most common use of such an astronomical interferometer is to determine the apparent angular diameter of a radio source or star. If the distance to the object can then be determined by parallax or some other method, the physical diameter of the star can then be inferred.  An example of an optical intensity interferometer is the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer.  In quantum optics, some devices which take advantage of correlation and anti-correlation effects in beams of photons might be said to be intensity interferometers, although the term is usually reserved for observatories.
An intensity interferometer is built from two light detectors, typically either radio antenna or optical telescopes with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), separated by some distance, called the baseline. Both detectors are pointed at the same astronomical source, and intensity measurements are then transmitted to a central correlator facility. A major advantage of intensity interferometers is that only the measured intensity observed by each detector must be sent to the central correlator facility, rather than the amplitude and phase of the signal. The intensity interferometer measures interferometric visibilities like all other astronomical interferometers. These measurements can be used to calculate the diameter and limb darkening coefficients of stars, but with intensity interferometers aperture synthesis images cannot be produced as the visibility phase information is not preserved by an intensity interferometer.

CATEGORIES: Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Dodgers, Interleague play, Major League Baseball rivalries

The term Freeway Series refers to a series of baseball games played between Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim  of the American League and Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League. The series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5.  The term is akin to Subway Series which refers to meetings between New York City baseball teams. The term "Freeway Series" also inspired the official name of the regions' NHL rivalry: the Freeway Face-Off.[tpl]cite news|title=No controversy, just champions|date=December 14, 2007|first=Peter|last=Yoon|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=D3|quote=Now that we have the Freeway Faceoff between the Kings and Ducks to go along with the Freeway Series between the Dodgers and Angels, we need a name for this. It might be difficult to incorporate 'freeway' into it, though, since they share the same building. Maybe we could call it the 'We took the same freeway as you did to get here tipoff.' Or, 'The showdown at the intersection of the 10 and 110 freeways.'[/tpl]

Harry Diamond (1908–1996) was a socialist and an Irish nationalist.   He was the MP for Belfast Falls in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and later the leader of the Republican Labour Party.
In 1927, Diamond was the main initiator and first chairman of O'Donnell's GAA.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] He later became chairman of Antrim GAA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html |title=Northern Ireland Parliamentary Elections Results: Biographies |publisher=Election.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl]
Diamond was an active nationalist before the Second World War and in 1933 was sentenced to a month in jail for refusing to pay a fine given out for addressing an illegal rally in support of republican prisoners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20091028150416/http://geocities.com/irelandscw/band-Kielty.htm |title=Ireland and the Spanish Civil War - Who was Brendan Kielty? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl] The following year, he stood in the Belfast Central by-election as an "Anti-Partition" candidate.
Diamond was first elected in the 1940s at a time when the Irish Labour Party was in government in the Republic of Ireland. He left the Labour Party because of the (indirect) consequences of that government's travails over the Mother and Child Scheme and the demand of the majority of Irish Labour members in Belfast that the party should challenge the entrenched power of the Catholic Church in Ireland. Diamond opposed these demands and left the party to fight a city council by-election against a Protestant Irish Labour Party supporter of reform. Diamond lost the by-election but viciously attacked the Labour Party for being in the grip of Communism, thereby effectively destroying it as a political force.[tpl]Fact|date=February 2007[/tpl]
In 1944, Diamond became a founder member of the Socialist Republican Party.  He took the Belfast Falls seat at the Northern Ireland general election, 1945.  In 1949, no-one else contested the seat, and he remained the Socialist Republican Party's only MP, but the party disbanded that year.  While most of its members joined the Irish Labour Party, Diamond held his seat, until 1964 as an independent standing as "Republican Labour".
In 1964, Diamond joined with Gerry Fitt to found the Republican Labour Party. He stood for the Westminster constituency of Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency) in the October 1964 UK general election, but was defeated by James Kilfedder. The campaign was disfigured by riots after Ian Paisley attempted to lead a Unionist crowd up Divis Street to remove an Irish tricolour from the offices of Sinn Féin, who were supporting the candidacy of Billy McMillen. The riots galvanised the Unionist vote while the nationalist vote was split between Diamond and McMillen. Diamond alleged that the official Ulster Unionist Party had colluded in this.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/docs/boyd69.htm |title=CAIN: Andrew Boyd. (1969) Holy War in Belfast |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl]
Diamond saw a strong challenge to his position from the resurgent Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) in the late 1960s, and was criticised for being inattentive to his constituents' needs. Paddy Devlin of the NILP, a former supporter of the reformists in the Belfast branch of the Irish Labour Party, defeated him in the Northern Ireland general election, 1969.
In 1970, Fitt left the Republican Labour Party to found the broader-based Social Democratic and Labour Party.  Paddy Kennedy assumed the leadership, but the party was in terminal decline and disbanded in 1973.

[[Helen Cruickshank]]
CATEGORIES: 1886 births, 1975 deaths, Lallans poets, Scottish suffragists, Scottish Renaissance, People from Montrose, Angus

Helen Burness Cruickshank (15 May 1886 - 2 March 1975) was a minor Scottish poet and suffragette, better known for being a focal point of the Scottish Renaissance. At her home in Corstorphine, various Scottish writers of note would meet.
Born Helen Burness Cruickshank in Hillside, near Montrose, Angus, of local parents, she went to school in Montrose. Summer holidays were spent in Glenesk and the landscapes and people of Angus and its glens appear in her poetry. After leaving school, Cruickshank entered the Civil Service, working first in London for the Post Office from 1903 to 1912, and then, from 1912, in Edinburgh, where she spent most of her adult life. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union and actively campaigned for the Suffragette cause. She was also a committed Scottish nationalist, an active member of the Saltire Society, and a founder member of Scottish PEN, which she served in various ways. She encouraged the work of the young CM Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid), of James Leslie Mitchell (Lewis Grassic Gibbon), and other writers, and was sympathetic in her appreciation of the poetry of Violet Jacob and Marion Angus. Helen Cruickshank devoted much of her life to other people (she cared for her elderly mother), yet published poetry over several decades, in Scottish chapbook, Northern numbers and many other journals, and in Up the Noran Water (1934), Sea Buckthorn (1954), The Ponnage pool (1968), Collected poems (1971) and More collected poems. 
Helen Cruickshank's best known poem is probably Shy Geordie which, like much of her work, is in Lowland Scots and draws on her Angus country heritage (the poem has been set to music by several people, including Buxton Orr and Jim Reid). Many of her poems echo ballad and folksong and other traditional forms. In Glenskenno Woods, There was a sang or Fause friend show a range of mood and tone, from lyrical to humorous, and her best work avoids the charge of sentimentality which might sometimes be levelled. She draws on the natural world for strong symbols about human life, as in the fine Sea Buckthorn (set to music by Francis George Scott), or in Ponnage pool, prefaced with a quotation from Hugh MacDiarmid; this deals with questions of personal identity: 
Cruickshank also wrote in English; her poem Spring in the Mearns for instance, is a tribute to Lewis Grassic Gibbon. Lines for Wendy Wood celebrate another activist; this poem also illustrates Cruickshank's own passionate concern with social problems, her compassion and commitment to the fighting of poverty and injustice, shown, too, in a Lowland Scots poem such as Song of pity for refugees. 
Cruickshank cared for her mother for many years; she herself retired in 1946. She was awarded an honorary MA by Edinburgh University in 1971, and two years later poor health forced her to leave her house in Corstorphine and move to Queensberry Lodge in the Canongate, where she died on 2 March 1975. Cruickshank recorded her long life and aspects of her times in her autobiography, Octobiography (1987), which was published posthumously.
Helen Cruickshank is commemorated in Makars' Court, outside The Writers' Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh.
Selections for Makars' Court are made by The Writers' Museum; The Saltire Society; The Scottish Poetry Library.

Hans Kohlhase (c. 1500–1540), born in Tempelberg, was a German historical figure about whose personality some controversy exists. 
He was a merchant, and not, as some have supposed, a horsedealer, and he lived at Cölln in Brandenburg (today's Berlin). 
In October 1532, as the story runs, whilst proceeding to the fair at Leipzig, he was attacked and his horses were taken from him by the servants of a Saxon nobleman, one Günter von Zaschwitz. In consequence of the delay the merchant suffered some loss of business at the fair and on his return he refused to pay the rather large sum which Zaschwitz demanded as a condition of returning the horses. In return Kohlhase asked for a substantial amount of money as compensation for his loss, and failing to secure this he invoked the aid of his sovereign, the elector of Brandenburg. Finding however that it was impossible to recover his horses, he paid Zaschwitz the sum required for them, but reserved to himself the right to take further action. Then unable to obtain redress in the courts of law, the merchant, in a Fehdebrief, threw down a challenge, not only to his aggressor, but to the whole of Saxony. Acts of lawlessness were soon attributed to him, and after an attempt to settle the feud had failed, the elector of Saxony, John Frederick I, set a price upon the head of the angry merchant. Kohlhase now sought revenge in earnest. Gathering around him a band of criminals and desperadoes, he spread terror throughout the whole of Saxony; travellers were robbed, villages were burned and towns were plundered. For some time the authorities were practically powerless to stop these outrages, but in March 1540 Kohlhase and his principal associate, Georg Nagelschmidt, were seized, and on the 22nd of the month they were broken on the wheel in Berlin.
Kohlhase is chiefly known as the hero of Heinrich von Kleist's novel, Michael Kohlhaas, which was made into two films, Michael Kohlhaas – der Rebell in 1969, and Michael Kohlhaas in 2013.

[[Gobrecht dollar]]

CATEGORIES: United States dollar coins, United States silver coins

The Gobrecht dollar, minted from 1836 to 1839, was the first silver dollar struck for circulation by the United States Mint since production of that denomination was officially halted in 1806. The coin was struck in small numbers to determine whether the reintroduced silver dollar would be well received by the public.
In 1835, Director of the United States Mint Samuel Moore resigned his post, and Robert M. Patterson assumed the position. Shortly after, Patterson began an attempt to redesign the nation's coinage. After Mint Chief Engraver William Kneass suffered a stroke later that year, Christian Gobrecht was hired as an engraver. On August 1, Patterson wrote a letter to Philadelphia artist Thomas Sully laying out his plans for the dollar coin. He also asked Titian Peale to create a design for the coin. Sully created an obverse design depicting a seated representation of Liberty and Peale a reverse depicting a soaring bald eagle, which were converted into coin designs by Gobrecht. After the designs were created and trials struck, production of the working dies began in September 1836.
After a small quantity was struck for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's name on the dollar, and the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.

After graduation, Sadkin worked with Jim Hendee at a sea turtle farm called Mariculture, Ltd. on Grand Cayman Island, where they both lived on Seven Mile Beach, a few miles from the town of Hell. During their six months of living and SCUBA diving there, they got their first taste of playing reggae at several clubs around the island.
When Sadkin returned to South Florida he began his recording career.  He was first trained as a mastering engineer but eventually moved into recording studio work as a "tape-op" (Assistant Engineer) at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida.  He got his first big break after impressing Neil Young with his mixing ability, and he eventually became head engineer at Compass Point Studio in Nassau, Bahamas.  He worked alongside Island Records boss Chris Blackwell on many of the label's projects, most famously  with Bob Marley & The Wailers, including the seminal Rastaman Vibration. 
A full member of the Compass Point All Stars from day one, he began producing artists for Island Records (Grace Jones, Marianne Faithfull, Robert Palmer, Joe Cocker), while doing mixing work for other labels (Talking Heads). Among the other artists he produced in the 1980s are James Brown, the J. Geils Band, Thompson Twins, Classix Nouveaux, Foreigner, Duran Duran, Simply Red, Arcadia and Paul Haig.
Alex Sadkin was a mentor to engineer and producer Phil Thornalley, who would go on to work with The Cure, Johnny Hates Jazz, and Natalie Imbruglia. He had a special gift of being able to sense and analyze an artist's inner creative abilities and talents, even if the artist couldn't.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] Composer-keyboardist Wally Badarou had this to say about Sadkin: "His dedication to maintain genuine 'mixes in progress' from the word go, was a great lesson. I made it a system for my subsequent production from then on."Wally Badarou's official website on Grace Jones' "Private Life" ("Warm Leatherette" album / Island-Universal)
Sadkin died in a motor accident in Nassau at the age of 38, shortly after completing production work on Boom Crash Opera's eponymous 1987 album, and just before he was due to begin working with Ziggy Marley. The Duran Duran song "Do You Believe In Shame", Robbie Nevil's "Gone Too Soon" and Grace Jones' "Well Well Well" are dedicated to his memory. Also Joe Cocker's album Unchain My Heart (1987) is dedicated to the memory of Alex Sadkin.

CATEGORIES: 1880 births, 1958 deaths, Scottish composers, People from Hawick, Alumni of the University of Edinburgh, Alumni of Durham University

Francis George Scott (25 January 1880 – 6 November 1958) was a Scottish composer.
Born at 6 Oliver Crescent, Hawick, Roxburghshire, he was the son of a supplier of mill-engineering parts. Educated at Hawick, and at the universities of Edinburgh and Durham, he studied composition under Jean Roger-Ducasse. In 1925, he became Lecturer in Music at Jordanhill Training College for Teachers, Glasgow, a post he held for more than twenty-five years. 
He wrote more than three hundred songs, including many settings of Hugh MacDiarmid, William Dunbar, William Soutar and Robert Burns's poems. MacDiarmid stated in an essay that his key long poem A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle could not have been completed without Scott's help.
The Anglo-Scottish composer Ronald Stevenson has transcribed several of Scott's works for piano.Gasser, M., "Ronald Stevenson, Composer-Pianist : An Exegetical Critique from a Pianistic Perspective" (Edith Cowan University Press, Western Australia, 2013) 
Scott is often associated with the Scottish Renaissance. His daughter, Lillias, married the Scottish composer Erik Chisholm.

[[Draped Bust dollar]]

CATEGORIES: United States dollar coins, United States silver coins

The Draped Bust dollar is a United States dollar coin minted from 1795 to 1803, and again into the 1850s. The design succeeded the Flowing Hair dollar, which began mintage in 1794 and was the first silver dollar struck by the United States Mint. The designer is unknown, though the distinction is usually credited to artist Gilbert Stuart. The model is also unknown, though Ann Willing Bingham has been suggested.
In October 1795, newly appointed Mint Director Elias Boudinot ordered that the legal fineness of .892 (89.2%) silver be used for the dollar rather than the unauthorized fineness of .900 (90%) silver that had been used since the denomination was first minted in 1794. Due largely to a decrease in the amount of silver deposited at the Philadelphia Mint, coinage of silver dollars declined throughout the latter years of the 18th century. In 1804, coinage of silver dollars was halted; the last date used during regular mint production was 1803.
In 1834, silver dollar production was temporarily restarted to supply a diplomatic mission to Asia with a special set of proof coins. Officials mistakenly believed that dollars had last been minted with the date 1804, prompting them to use that date rather than the date in which the coins were actually struck. A limited number of 1804 dollars were struck by the Mint in later years, and they remain rare and valuable.

Ephraim Shay (July 17, 1839 – April 19, 1916) designed the first Shay locomotive and patented the type.
He was born on July 17, 1839, in Sherman Township, Huron County, Ohio. His parents were James and Phoebe (Probasco) Shay.
In 1861, he moved to Muir, Michigan, and shortly after enlisted in Company D, 8th Missouri Volunteer Infantry. From his American Civil War Diary, Ephraim wrote "Received marching orders. Quite a coincidence; on the day I am 22 years old I start on my first expedition to defend my country's honor and flag." Ephraim served in the Western Theatre of the war, under General William Tecumseh Sherman. He was honorably discharged in 1864, returned to Ohio and married Jane Henderson on July 26 of that year.
He and his wife then moved to Ionia County, Michigan, to be near family members in Portland, Lyons, Muir, and Sebewa. In 1870 they moved to Sunfield, Michigan, where Ephraim operated a steam Sawmill. There, they had their son, Lette, on January 26, 1870.
After 1873, they moved to Haring, Michigan, where Shay established a general store and sawmill. In 1876 or 1877, Ephraim had an idea to use a locomotive to haul logs. With maple strips on pine rails, the origins of the Shay locomotive were put to use. Ephraim started working with Lima Machine Works (later Lima Locomotive Works) in Lima, Ohio, and in 1880, the first Shay Locomotive was shipped to a customer in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1881, Shay started filing patents. Lima built 4 Shay locomotives in 1881, and 37 Shays in 1883. In 1884, Lima had a 34 page catalog, with five models of Shay Locomotives. By the late 1890s, Shay Locomotives were shipped around the world.
In 1888, Shay moved to Harbor Springs, Michigan. There, he designed and built a hexagonal shaped house with six wings opening off the central core with a tower on top, still extant. The interior and exterior walls were stamped steel. In 1891, Shay built an all-steel boat that was 40 feet long and a beam of 6 feet, named the Aha. Remains of the Aha are now back in Harbor Springs. Shay also designed and operated a private water works for Harbor Springs.
Shay established a railroad, the Harbor Springs Railway (nicknamed the "Hemlock Central"), chartered in 1902 and dissolved in 1912. Three locomotives of Shay's design were the only motive power. The road primarily hauled lumber, but was also used for sightseeing. Shay also made sleds with Maple runners as Christmas gifts for local children, over 400 of them over the years.
In 1912, Ephraim's wife Jane died on July 24. Ephraim died on April 19, 1916 & is buried in the Lakeview Cemetery in Harbor Springs, MI.
The Harbor Springs Area Historical Society sponsors the "Shay Days" festival, on a weekend close to his birthday each year at the hexagon house. In 2005, the festival was held July 15, July 16, and July 17.

CATEGORIES: Jackets, One-piece suits, Uniforms, Youth culture, Universities and colleges in Sweden

Particular boilersuits or "student overalls" are widely used for specific events at universities and polytechnics in Sweden and Finland. Typically, the overalls are procured by the student associations of faculties or programmes. At the major Swedish universities (like Lund or Uppsala) the use of overalls is limited to engineering students, but their use has spread to students in other fields at some of the smaller university colleges. In Finland, overalls have been foremost identified with engineering students, but see extensive use in all of the student organizations of Finnish institutions of higher learning, such as University of Helsinki and Aalto University.

AIDS, also known as Aids Info Disk or PC Cyborg Trojan, is a trojan horse that replaces the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, which would then be used by AIDS to count the number of times the computer has booted. Once this boot count reaches 90, AIDS hides directories and encrypts the names of all files on drive C: (rendering the system unusable), at which time the user is asked to 'renew the license' and contact PC Cyborg Corporation for payment (which would involve sending 189 US$ to a post office box in Panama). There exists more than one version of AIDS, and at least one version does not wait to munge drive C:, but will hide directories and encrypt file names upon the first boot after AIDS is installed. The AIDS software also presented to the user an end user license agreement, some of which read:
AIDS is considered to be an early example of a class of malware known as "ransomware".

Crypto-Islam is the secret adherence to Islam while publicly professing to be of another faith; people who practice crypto-Islam are referred to as "crypto-Muslims". The word has mainly been used in reference to Spanish Muslims during the Inquisition (i.e., the Moriscos and their usage of Aljamiado).
Related to this term are the concepts of crypto-Muslim subgroups, such as crypto-Sunni Muslims and crypto-Shia Muslims.  Each of these Muslim subgroups has suffered persecution at various times under various leaders where it was advantageous to appear as part of the dominant (sometimes also Muslim) group.
Some mention was made of the concept during the 2008 U.S. Presidential Campaign in accusations directed towards President Barack Obama.

Sean Patrick Paul O'Sullivan, CM (January 1, 1952 – March 9, 1989) was a Canadian politician who left politics and became a Roman Catholic priest. 
Born in 1952 in Hamilton, Ontario, O'Sullivan showed an interest in politics at a young age: when he was 11 years old he worked for Ellen Fairclough in her election campaign and met John Diefenbaker for the first time. He was educated at Bishop Ryan Catholic Secondary School and Brock University in St. Catharines. In 1970, at age 18, he was chosen as president of the Young Progressive Conservatives of Canada.
In 1971, Diefenbaker appointed O'Sullivan as his executive assistant, and in the 1972 election, the 20-year-old O'Sullivan was elected the Progressive Conservative MP for the riding of Hamilton—Wentworth, becoming the youngest member of the Canadian House of Commons ever at that point (in 1974, Liberal Claude-André Lachance became the youngest-ever MP, and New Democrat Pierre-Luc Dusseault beat that record in 2011). He rose quickly through the ranks of the party and was seen as a future cabinet minister or even leader. He was re-elected in 1974.
However, in 1977, O'Sullivan surprised many political observers when he announced that he was leaving politics to enter the Roman Catholic priesthood, eventually becoming Director of Vocations for the Archdiocese of Toronto, as well as publisher of The Catholic Register newspaper.
O'Sullivan learned he was suffering from leukemia in 1983. After treatment, the disease was in remission and he resumed his busy career. In 1986, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. With the return of his illness in 1989, O'Sullivan entered Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto for a bone marrow transplant. He died there on March 9, 1989, aged 37.

[[Partial redundancy elimination]]

CATEGORIES: Compiler optimizations, Articles with example code

In compiler theory, partial redundancy elimination (PRE) is a compiler optimization that eliminates expressions that are redundant on some but not necessarily all paths through a program. PRE is a form of common subexpression elimination.
An expression is called partially redundant if the value computed by the expression is already available on some but not all paths through a program to that expression.  An expression is fully redundant if the value computed by the expression is available on all paths through the program to that expression. PRE can eliminate partially redundant expressions by inserting the partially redundant expression on the paths that do not already compute it, thereby making the partially redundant expression fully redundant.
For instance, in the following code:
the expression x+4 assigned to z is partially redundant because it is computed twice if some_condition is true.  PRE would perform code motion on the expression to yield the following optimized code:
An interesting property of PRE is that it performs (a form of) common subexpression elimination and loop-invariant code motion at the same time. In addition, PRE can be extended to eliminate injured partial redundancies, thereby effectively performing strength reduction. This makes PRE one of the most important optimizations in optimizing compilers. Traditionally, PRE is applied to lexically equivalent expressions, but recently formulations of PRE based on static single assignment form have been published that apply the PRE algorithm to values instead of expressions, unifying PRE and global value numbering.

[[River Trym]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Gloucestershire, Rivers of Bristol

The River Trym is a short river, some [tpl]convert|4.5|mi|km[/tpl] in length, which rises in Filton, South Gloucestershire, England.  The upper reaches are culverted, some underground, through mostly urban landscapes, but once it emerges into the open it flows through a nature reserve and city parks before joining the tidal River Avon at Sea Mills. 18th-century water mills near the mouth gave the area its name.
Portus Abonae was a Roman port at the mouth which provided an embarkation point for journeys across the River Severn to South Wales. In the 18th century there were short lived attempts at creating a port and a whale fishery here. The name Trym appears to have Anglo-Saxon roots. In recent years silting problems, caused by urban development have caused some difficulties, but alleviation works have helped reduce the problem.

[[Intelligence and public policy]]

CATEGORIES: Race and intelligence controversy, Public policy

A large body of research indicates that intelligence measures such as Intelligence Quotient (IQ) varies between individuals and between certain groups, and that they correlate with socially important outcomes such as educational achievement, employment, crime, poverty and socioeconomic status.
In the United States, certain public policies and laws regarding employment, military service, education and crime incorporate IQ or similar measurements. Internationally, certain public policies, such as improving nutrition and prohibiting neurotoxic toxins, have as one of their goals raising or preventing a decline in intelligence.

[[Pass of Drumochter]]
CATEGORIES: Mountain passes of Scotland, Roads in Scotland, Badenoch and Strathspey, Geography of Perth and Kinross

The Pass of Drumochter ([tpl]lang-gd|Bealach Druim Uachdair[/tpl]) is the main mountain pass between the northern and southern central Scottish Highlands. The A9 road passes through here, as does the Highland Main Line, the railway between Inverness and the south of Scotland. The Sustrans National Cycle Route 7 between Glasgow and Inverness also runs through the pass. 
The pass was formed by glacial action during successive Ice Ages. From this place the River Garry flows to the south, and the River Truim to the north.
The route through the pass has been used since prehistoric times. A military road built between 1728 and 1730 by General Wade came through here.
It is the high point on the A9, at 460 m (1508 ft), and in winter can be subject to severe weather conditions. There are routine winter patrols from November to March, and the road is occasionally closed with snow gates near Dalwhinnie and Dalnacardoch. The summit of the railway line is 452 m (1480 ft), making it the highest in the UK. It is used by the RAF as a main route for low level flying and Tornados and other fast jets may often be seen here.
It is isolated, and the nearest settlement of any size is the small village of Dalwhinnie, some 10 km to the north.
The summit of the pass marks the boundary between Perth and Kinross and the Highland Council area. A sign at this point says "Welcome to the Highlands/Fàilte don Ghàidhealtachd", although this is the boundary for the authority rather than for the Scottish Highlands which extend further south of here.

The Penrhyn Quarry Railway first opened in 1798 as the Llandegai Tramway; it became the Penrhyn Railway in 1801 although on a different route. Constructed to transport slate from Lord Penrhyn's slate quarries at Bethesda to Port Penrhyn at Bangor, Wales, the railway was around six miles long and used a gauge of [tpl]RailGauge|1ft10.75in[/tpl]. It is one of the oldest narrow gauge railways in the world, and closed in 1962.
Penrhyn Quarries Ltd completed the restoration of a section of the original railway at Felin Fawr, Bethesda in 2012 and returned ex- Penrhyn Quarry locomotive George Sholto from Norfolk for a day to commemorate fifty years since the railway closed. 
The section of restored railway is approximately half a mile in length and referred to as phase one. A second phase of the restoration is expected to commence in 2015 and will add approximately one additional mile to the total length of the restored railway.

[[Jules Violle]]

CATEGORIES: 1841 births, 1923 deaths, People from Langres, French physicists, École Normale Supérieure alumni

Jules Louis Gabriel Violle (November 16, 1841, Langres, Haute-Marne - September 12, 1923, Fixin) was a French physicist and inventor.
He is notable for having determined the solar constant at Mont Blanc in 1875, and, in 1881, for proposing a standard for luminous intensity, called the Violle, equal to the light emitted by 1 cm² of platinum at its melting point. (It was notable as the first unit of light intensity that did not depend on the properties of a particular lamp, but it was made obsolete by the candela, the standard SI unit.)
Throughout his life, Violle taught at several colleges including the University of Lyon and the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris. He was one of the founders of the Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée and the École supérieure d'optique. He improved and invented a number of devices for measuring radiation, and determined the freezing and melting points of palladium.
Violle is believed by some to be the secret identity of Fulcanelli, a contemporary French alchemist whose true identity is still debated. You can find his biography with this book "A l'ombre des chênes, l'alchimiste de la République (in the shade of the oak) http://toysondor.wordpress.com/librairie/fulcanelli-a-lombre-des-chenes/

CATEGORIES: Arabic orthography, Romanization of Arabic, Romanization

Different approaches and methods for the romanization of Arabic exist. They vary in the way that they address the inherent problems of rendering written and spoken Arabic in the Latin script. Examples of such problems are the symbols for Arabic phonemes that do not exist in English or other European languages; the means of representing the Arabic definite article, which is always spelled the same way in written Arabic but has numerous pronunciations in the spoken language depending on context; and the representation of short vowels (usually i u or e o, accounting for variations such as Muslim/Moslem or Mohammed/Muhammad/Mohamed).

Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf ([tpl]lang-ar|هاشم بن عبد مناف[/tpl]; ca. 464 – 497) was the great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the progenitor of the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraish tribe in Mecca.
His name was 'Amr al-ʻUlā ([tpl]lang-ar|عمرو العلا[/tpl]) but he was given the nickname Hashim which translates as pulverizer in Arabic - because he initiated the practice of providing crumbled bread in broth for the pilgrims to the Ka'aba in Mecca. Another version of the story of this naming is that Hashim comes from the Arabic root Hashm, to save the starving, because he arranged for the feeding of the people of Mecca during a seasonal famine, and he thus became "the man who fed the starving" or in [tpl]lang-ar|هشم الجياع[/tpl].

[[Fire-stick farming]]

CATEGORIES: Australian Aboriginal bushcraft, Agriculture in Australia, Bushfood, Wildfire ecology

Fire-stick farming, a term coined by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969, describes the practice of Indigenous Australians who regularly used fire to burn vegetation to facilitate hunting and to change the composition of plant and animal species in an area.
Fire-stick farming had the long-term effect of turning dry rainforest into savanna, increasing the population of nonspecific grass-eating species like the kangaroo. One theory of the extinction of Australian megafauna implicates the ecological disturbance caused by fire-stick farming.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr/11/c011p051.pdf|title=Desertification and climate change—the Australian perspective|author=G. Pickup[/tpl]
In the resultant sclerophyll forests, fire-stick farming maintained an open canopy and allowed germination of understory plants necessary for increasing the carrying capacity of the local environment for browsing and grazing marsupials.
It may be argued[tpl]Who|date=July 2013[/tpl] that Aborigines were able to aim the burning of the scrub to avoid growing areas. It is also thought[tpl]Who|date=July 2013[/tpl] that there may[tpl]clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl] have been a ritual taboo against burning certain areas of Jungle.[tpl]cite web|url= http://austhrutime.com/fire-stick_farmers.htm|title=  Fire-Stick Farmers[/tpl]
This type of farming also directly increased the food supply for the aborigines, by promoting the growth of bush potatoes and other edible ground-level plants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.schools.nt.edu.au/tlcland/publications/Fire%20Book.pdf|title = The Fire Book | year = 2005| publisher = Tangentyre Landcare |accessdate =  24 March 2014[/tpl]

[[Marcus Neff]]

CATEGORIES: 1826 births, 1896 deaths

Marcus Neff (1826 - February 20, 1896) was the respondent in the United States Supreme Court case Pennoyer v. Neff. Neff was one of the early settlers of the U.S. state of Oregon, having traveled there from Iowa in early 1848.  Neff subsequently claimed a parcel of land in Oregon under the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850.  In 1862, Neff transacted some business with a local attorney by the name of John H. Mitchell, possibly in connection with his American land patent. On November 3, 1865, Mitchell brought action against Neff for failure to pay legal fees and won.  The court had Neff's land sold at sheriff's auction to pay the less than $300 Mitchell was owed.  Mitchell also bought the land in question at the auction, assigning it later to Sylvester Pennoyer.  Neff then sued Pennoyer over the land.  Neff prevailed in the trial court and Pennoyer subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  The U.S. Supreme Court in an opinion authored by Justice Stephen J. Field upheld the lower court's judgment on the case, but on different grounds.

Johann Baptist Alzog (8 June 1808 – 1 March 1878) was a German theologian and Catholic church historian.
He was born at Ohlau, in Silesia. He studied at Breslau and Bonn and was ordained priest at Cologne in 1834. 
In the following year he accepted the chairs of exegesis and church history at the seminary of Posen. He defended with ardour the Archbishop of that city, Martin von Dunin, during his persecution by the Prussian government, became vicar-capitular, professor and regens at Hildesheim in 1845, and in 1853 was appointed to the chair of Church History in the University of Freiburg (Breisgau); at the same time he was appointed an ecclesiastical councillor (geistlicher Rat). He held that post until his death at Freiburg. 
Together with Döllinger, Alzog was instrumental in convoking the famous Munich assembly of Catholic scholars in 1863. He also took part, with Bishop Hefele and Bishop Haseberg, in the preparatory work of the First Vatican Council and voted in favor of the doctrine of Papal infallibility but against the opportuneness of its promulgation.

George M. Averoff (15 August 1815, Metsovo – 15 July 1899, al-Raml/Ramleh, Alexandria), alternately Georgios Averof (in Greek: Γεώργιος  Αβέρωφ), was a Greek businessman and philanthropist of Aromanian origin.
Born in the town of Metsovo (Epirus, Greece, then Ottoman Empire) Averoff moved to Alexandria while still young.  He was known through most of his life for founding numerous schools in both Egypt and Greece.
As a benefactor, he contributed funds for the restoration of the Panathenian Stadium in readiness for the 1896 Summer Olympics. This he did at the request of Crown Prince Constantine.  The stadium was refurbished in 1895, its second refurbishment in the 19th century, using white marble from Mount Penteli pursuant to Averoff's request. The cost was initially estimated at 585,000 drachmas but eventually reached 920,000.The Modern Olympics: A Struggle for Revival, by David C. Young, p. 128. The Johns Hopkins University Press. 1996. ISBN 0-8018-5374-5  
He also served as a member of the reception committee for the foreign competitors at the Games.
In gratitude for his contributions, a statue of Averoff was commissioned and placed in front of the Panathenian Stadium. It remains there today.
In addition, a Greek cruiser, the flagship of the Hellenic Navy, which was constructed largely with funds (2,500,000 Gold francs) provided for under his will, was named after him.

[[Northwest Territories general election, 1898]]
CATEGORIES: Elections in the Northwest Territories, 1898 elections in Canada, 1898 in Canada

The Northwest Territories general election of 1898 took place on 4 November 1898. This was the fourth general election in the history of the Northwest Territories, Canada. It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories.
Frederick W. A. G. Haultain was still the first premier of the NWT. That title was given by legislation passed in 1897. He was the last premier of the Northwest Territories until 1980. 
There were three big issues in this election, provincial rights and how to divide the provinces.
The second issue was the transfer of education, from the federal to the territorial level, this was Haultain's personal project, unfortunately for the Territories, that power would not be turned over until 1970.
The third issue, was the territories deficit budget, the territory was facing huge pressures from a rapidly increasing population in all parts of the territory. Earlier in 1898 the territorial government tried to exert control over liquor revenue in the Klondike, since it was footing the bill for increased services and policing. The federal government however interfered and delt a huge blow, when it carved the Yukon out of the Northwest Territories and appointed a council loyal to the federal government to gain control.
This was the first general election in which the election was contested along party lines in Northwest Territories. Frederick W. A. G. Haultain would sustain the governing Northwest Territories Liberal-Conservative Party in coalition with James Hamilton Ross who was a member of the Hautain cabinet but a Liberal member. Robert Brett remained leader of the official opposition.
Political parties were still controversial in this election as noted in the Calgary Herald editorial from 17 November 1898 Weekly edition, that debated the pros and cons of the bringing the "Dominion party lines" to the territorial legislature.

[[Calcium phosphide]]

CATEGORIES: Phosphides, Calcium compounds, Rodenticides, Fumigants

Calcium phosphide (CP, Ca3P2) is a chemical used in incendiary bombs. It has the appearance of red-brown crystalline powder or grey lumps, with melting point of 1600 °C. Its trade name is Photophor for the incendiary use or Polytanol  for the use as rodenticide.
It may be formed by reaction of the elements.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] 
Metal phosphides have been used as rodenticides. A mixture of food and calcium phosphide is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate the toxic gas phosphine. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents immune to many of the common poisons have appeared. Other pesticides similar to calcium phosphide are zinc phosphide and aluminium phosphide.
Calcium phosphide is also used in fireworks, torpedoes, self-igniting naval pyrotechnic flares, and various water-activated ammunition. During the 1920s and 1930s, Charles Kingsford Smith used separate buoyant canisters of calcium carbide and calcium phosphide as naval flares lasting up to ten minutes. It is speculated[tpl]according to whom|date=December 2013[/tpl] that calcium phosphide was an ingredient of some ancient Greek fire formulas.
Calcium phosphide is a common impurity in calcium carbide, which may cause the resulting phosphine-contaminated acetylene to ignite spontaneously.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

[[Einstein coefficients]]

CATEGORIES: Emission spectroscopy

In physics, one thinks of atomic spectral lines from two viewpoints.
The two states must be bound states in which the electron is bound to the atom, so the transition is sometimes referred to as a "bound–bound" transition, as opposed to a transition in which the electron is ejected out of the atom completely ("bound–free" transition) into a continuum state, leaving an ionized atom, and generating continuum radiation.

Bai Mudan ([tpl]zh|c=白牡丹|l=white peony[/tpl]) is a type of white tea made from plucks each with one leaf shoot and two immediate young leaves.陳宗懋, 中國茶經, pp 236 上海文化出版社 ISBN 7-80511-499-4 Bai Mudan is sometimes preferred by white tea drinkers for its fuller flavor and greater potency than the other major type of white tea, Bai Hao Yinzhen. The latter is made purely with leaf shoots, and so it is comparatively softer and more subtle. The typical taste of Bai Mudan is a result of both the processing and the tea plant cultivars employed in the production.[tpl]cite web | author=Tea Guardian | title=White & Other Lightly Oxidized Teas | url=http://teaguardian.com/nature_of_tea/whites.html | accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl]

Reimar Constantin von Alvensleben (26 August 1809 – 28 March 1892) was a Prussian (and later Imperial German) general.
Born at Eichenbarleben in the Province of Saxony, Alvensleben entered the Prussian Guards from the cadet corps in 1827. He became first lieutenant in 1842, captain in 1849, and major on the Great General Staff in 1853, whence after seven years he went to the Ministry of War. He was soon afterwards promoted colonel, and commanded a regiment of Guard infantry up to 1864, when he became a major-general after the Second Schleswig War. 
Alvensleben commanded a brigade of guards in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. At the action of Soor (Burkersdorf) on 28 June, he distinguished himself greatly, and at the Battle of Königgrätz where he led the advanced guard of the Guards Corps, his energy and initiative were still more conspicuous. Soon afterwards he succeeded to the command of his division, General Wilhelm Hiller von Gärtringen having fallen in the battle; he was promoted lieutenant-general, and retained this command after the conclusion of peace, receiving in addition the order Pour le Mérite for his services.
In 1870, on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Alvensleben succeeded Prince Frederick Charles in command of the III Army Corps, which formed part of the 2nd German army. But his questionable judgment with inconsidered attacks at Vionville-Mars-la-Tour resulted in heavy calualties.Roland Koch, « Les canons à balles dans l’armée du Rhin en 1870 » Revue historique des armées, 255 | 2009 Shortly before his death in 1892 he was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle.
The Prussian Infantry Regiment Nr. 52 in Cottbus was named von Alvensleben in his honour.

[[Roland Bolt amplifier]]
CATEGORIES: Instrument amplifiers

The Roland Bolt 30/60/100 was the only line of tube guitar amplifiers produced by Roland. The amplifier was launched in the market in 1979 when the Roland company was trying to pursue the success of the Mesa Boogie Mark amplifiers. 
Properly speaking these are hybrid amplifiers, the pre-amp being built with solid-state circuitry. The built-in solid-state distortion channel gives a somewhat harsh sound, and is best bypassed.
Aside from the overdrive circuit, the amp contains a spring reverb, and provision for external effects loops and switches.
The Bolt was produced until 1984: Roland made a decision at that time to focus production on solid state amplifiers such as their very successful Jazz Chorus. In recent years the interest in this range of amplifiers has increased, owing to their good tone, and affordability in comparison with other classic amplifiers.
Both combo (amp/speaker) and 'head' versions of these amplifiers were produced. The combo amplifiers are often found (as in the illustrated example) with replacement speaker drivers, the original having failed under stress,http://bolt60.no.sapo.pt/Frames/repmods/speaker.htm as the Roland unit was only just beyond the constraints of the amplifier output.

The Amanitaceae are a family of fungi or mushrooms.  The family, also commonly called the amanita family, is in order Agaricales, gilled mushrooms.  The family consists primarily of the genus Amanita, but also includes the genera Catatrama and Limacella. 
Mycological works show great divergence in their definitions of families and the up-to-date and authoritative Index fungorum classifies these fungi as part of Pluteaceae. For a long time, they were placed in Agaricaceae.
The species are usually found in woodlands.  They emerge from an egg-like structure formed by the universal veil. 
This family contains several species valued for edibility and flavor, and other deadly poisonous ones.  More than half the cases of mushroom poisoning stem from members of this family.  The most toxic members of this group have names that warn of the poisonous nature, but others, of varying degrees of toxicity, do not.

Ivalice is described as a complex world with a very long history, and the stories of Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Final Fantasy XII are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ffworld.com/?rub=ff12&page=interview_jp-mai04 | title=Interview - Yasumi Matsuno | year=2004 | author=FFWorld Staff | work=www.ffworld.com[/tpl]
Though described often as a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, in which Ivalice was created parallel to the real world. The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region,Ivalice (Sage Knowledge 29 of 78), Clan Primer Bestiary [tpl]cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 [/tpl] and a smaller kingdom, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world.

[[Until I Find You]]

CATEGORIES: 2005 novels, Novels by John Irving, Random House books

Until I Find You (2005) is the 11th published novel by John Irving. The novel was originally written in first person and only changed 10 months before publication. After realizing that so much of the material—childhood sexual abuse; a long-lost father who eventually ends up in a mental institution—was too close to his own experiences, Irving postponed publication of the novel while he rewrote it entirely in third person. 
The cover is a close-up photo/illustration of the side of a woman's breast, with a tattoo on it (as in the novel). The American publisher requested their version be a very close shot of the side of the breast, so the body part in question wouldn't be readily identifiable, and therefore would not offend readers or passersby in the bookstore. The Canadian dust jacket features a close-up that is more readily identifiable as the side of a woman's breast (and is the dust jacket Irving prefers).

Herschmann won a silver medal at the initial modern Olympic Games, the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, in the men's 100-metre freestyle event. He also won a silver medal at the 1912 Summer Olympics, in the men's team sabre event in fencing. Herschmann is one of only a few athletes who have won Olympic medals in more than one sport.
He served as President of the Austrian Olympic Committee from 1912 to 1914. Herschmann was then President of the Austrian Swimming Federation from 1914 to 1932.
During the Nazi era, Herschmann was persecuted because he was Jewish. The Nazis arrested him in Vienna and deported him in 1942 to the Sobibór extermination camp, and then to the Izbica concentration camp, where he was killed.

Yiram of Magdiel ([tpl]lang-he|[tpl]hebrew|יראם המגדיאלי[/tpl][/tpl], fl. tenth century) was a minor Jewish commentator on the Bible, active in Rome. The term Magdiel, which appears in Genesis 36:43, was apparently interpreted as Rome (see Rashi on that verse), so that his name was really Yiram of Rome.[tpl]cite book|title=Geschichte der Juden in Rom |volume=1 |page=184|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oWELAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA184[/tpl] 
Yiram was a younger contemporary of Saadia Gaon and perhaps even his student. He apparently wrote a commentary on the Books of Chronicles, which is only known from a handful of fragments. These were later compiled into a single document, together with the works of other commentators such as Judah ibn Kuraish. The document was edited and published in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, in 1874 under the title Ein Kommentar zur Chronik aus dem 10. Jahrhundert. From this text it seems that the original compiler of the work was critical of Yiram's interpretation of the subject matter, and said that he did not fully understand the meaning of the passages on which he commented.

A Gas turbine locomotive is a locomotive powered by a gas turbine.  The majority of gas turbine locomotives have had electric transmission but mechanical transmission has also been used, particularly in the early days.  The advantage of using gas turbines is that they have very high power-to-bulk and power-to-weight ratios.  The disadvantage is that gas turbines generally have lower thermal efficiency than diesel engines, especially when running at less than full load.

CATEGORIES: Political theories, Political philosophy by politician

Neo-Bonapartism or neo-Bounapartism refers to political movements focusing around a strong leader, who is often a hero to the people, and upholds - or at least seems to uphold - the ideals of the people. With Bonapartism specifically referring to the case of Napoleon I of France, the term neo-Bonapartism first came to use with the rise of Louis Napoleon III. However, this is not a true example of what neo-Bonapartism has come to symbolize.  M. Raoul Duval is given as example in Contemporary France.[tpl]cite book  | last = Hanotaux  | first = Gabriel   | title = Contemporary France  | publisher = Books for Libraries Press   | date = 1907  | location =     | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=VLgNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA460&dq=%22Neo-Bonapartism%22+-wikipedia&as_brr=3&ie=ISO-8859-1#PPA460,M1  | doi =  | id =| page = 460  [/tpl]  Neo-Bonapartism can also be used to specifically refer to movements after Napoleon I, but it need not be confined to such. Ironically, the best example of Bonapartism may be Roman dictators from the Republican Period, like Julius Caesar, who attempted to quash the power of the Senate and advance the rights and welfare of the people.
Neo-Bonapartist philosophy is characterized by the leader. It is believed that a strong and capable leader is necessary for the ideals the Bonapartists support - be they left or right, moderate or radical. The leader is usually a great hero of the people - in most historical cases being military in nature - who brings about reforms in their name. This philosophy by itself has never been popular, and thus is almost always used in conjunction with others. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
Neo-Bonapartists are often similar to enlightened despots, who use their absolute power to advance liberalism, freedoms, and social welfare, though in many cases of supposed neo-Bonapartism the exact opposite is achieved; giving rise to bastard movements more like traditional dictatorships. Nationalism is also often a component of neo-Bonapartism, though not a necessary one.

The British National League (BNL) is a defunct second-level professional ice hockey league in the United Kingdom.  Although no formal promotion and relegation existed during its period of existence, it was considered to have a standard below that of the Ice Hockey Superleague (later replaced by the Elite Ice Hockey League) and above that of the English National Hockey League and the Scottish National League.
The league was founded in 1996 to replace the first division of the British Hockey League and for its first season only was split into the Northern Premier League and the Premier League.  From 2000 until 2003, it was sponsored by Findus.  It was disbanded at the end of the 2004/05 season, when the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers both left the league to join the rival Elite League.

[[Cognitive revolution]]

CATEGORIES: Cognitive science, History of psychology, Philosophical movements, Revolutions by type, Secularism, Western culture

The cognitive revolution is the name for an intellectual movement in the 1950s that began what are known collectively as the cognitive sciences. It began in the modern context of greater interdisciplinary communication and research. The relevant areas of interchange were the combination of psychology, anthropology, and linguistics with approaches developed within the then-nascent fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, and neuroscience.
A key idea in cognitive psychology was that by studying and developing successful functions in artificial intelligence and computer science, it becomes possible to make testable inferences about human mental processes. This has been called the reverse-engineering approach.
Important publications in setting off the cognitive revolution include George A. Miller's 1956 Psychological Review article "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two"[ref]

[[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]]

CATEGORIES: United States constitutional law, Article Five of the United States Constitution

A Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, also called an Article V Convention, or Amendments Convention, is one of two alternative procedures for proposing amendments to the United States Constitution described in Article Five of the Constitution. The other method is a vote by two-thirds of each house of Congress.
In recent years some constitutional scholars have argued that state governments should call for such a convention. They include Lawrence Lessig, Sanford Levinson, Larry Sabato, Jonathan Turley, and Mark Levin. As of 2014, there is an active nationwide effort to call an Article V Convention. Citizens for Self-Governance, through a project called Convention of the States, is promoting Article V legislation in all 50 states. In March 2014, Georgia became the first state to pass the group's Convention of States application.[tpl]cite news|last=Lowrey|first=Jason|title=Georgia Legislature calls for convention under Article V  Read more: The Daily Tribune News - Georgia Legislature calls for convention under Article V|url=http://www.daily-tribune.com/view/full_story/24722678/article-Georgia-Legislature-calls-for-convention-under-Article-V?instance=main_article|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=Daily Tribune News|date=3/12/2014[/tpl]  Alaska and Alabama are close to passing similar legislation.[tpl]cite news|last=Gill|first=Jeff|title=Convention of states may be hot issue in 2016 race|url=http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/section/6/article/96342/|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=Gainesville Times|date=3/4/2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Jones|first=Winston|title=House passes convention of states resolution|url=http://www.times-georgian.com/news/article_bf26626a-9b5e-11e3-b097-0017a43b2370.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Times-Georgian|date=2014-2-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Ritz|first=Erica|title=Another Big Name Just Officially Announced Their Support for a Convention of States|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/05/another-big-name-just-officially-announced-their-support-for-a-convention-of-states/|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=The Blaze|date=2/5/2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Weigel|first=Dave|title=Georgia, Tom Coburn Call for Constitutional Convention|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/02/06/tea_party_georgia_tom_coburn_call_for_constitutional_convention.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Slate|date=2/6/2014[/tpl]
According to Article V, Congress must call for an amendment-proposing convention, “on the application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States," meaning 34 state legislatures would have to submit applications. Once an Article V Convention has proposed an amendment or amendments, then the amendment or amendments would have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states (38 states) in order to become part of the Constitution.
Congress has the power to choose between two methods of ratification: ratification by the state legislatures, or instead ratification by state conventions called for that purpose. In contrast to those separate state ratification conventions, a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution would be a single federal convention. While there have been calls for a second federal convention based on a single issue such as the Balanced Budget Amendment, it is not clear whether a convention summoned in this way would be legally bound to limit discussion to a single issue; law professor Michael Stokes Paulsen has suggested that such a convention would have the "power to propose anything it sees fit". All 27 amendments to the Constitution have happened in a procedural sense by going through Congress and not through proposal by state legislatures.

[[Taphians]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek geography, Ancient Greek pirates, Ancient tribes in central Greece, Echinades

In Homeric Greece, the islands of Taphos[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] (Τάφος) lay in the Ionian Sea off the coast of Acarnania in northwestern Greece, home of seagoing and piratical inhabitants, the Taphians[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] (Τάφιοι). Penelope mentions the Taphian sea-robbers when she rebukes the chief of her suitors,Homer. Odyssey, Book XVI and it is disguised as Mentes, "lord of the Taphian men who love their oars," that Athena accepts the hospitality of Telemachus and speeds him on his journey from Ithaca to Pylos.Homer. Odyssey, Book I. The Taphians dealt in slaves.Homer. Odyssey, Book XV.
By the time of Euripides, the islands were identified with the Echinades: in Euripedes' Iphigeneia at Aulis (405 BCE), the chorus of women from Chalcis have spied the Hellenes' fleet and seen Eurytus who "led the Taphian warriors with the white oar-blades, the subjects of Meges, son of Phyleus, who had left the isles of the Echinades, where sailors cannot land."Iphenigea  Modern scholars, such as the editors of the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, identify the island of Taphos as the island of Meganissi (Meganísi) just east of the larger island Lefkada (Leucas).
The Taphians accounted themselves the descendants of Perseus, for the mother of Taphius, their eponymous colonizer, was a granddaughter of Perseus and lay with Poseidon to beget the heroic founder. Another tradition holds that Taphius was one of the  Leleges, and grandson of Lelex. Their most noted king was Pterelaos, rendered immortal by Poseidon by the single golden hair among the hairs of his head, but undone by his faithless daughter (Comaetho) who plucked it while he slept, so that the Mycenaean adventurer Amphitryon of Tiryns could overcome and kill him and retrieve the cattle Pterelaos' sons had rustled from Mycenae, with much spoils besides. As he was returning with his spoils to his bride at Thebes, Zeus preceded him by one night: taking Amphitryon's shape, and brandishing a Taphian cup as a sign of his success, the king of gods fathered Heracles.

The archipelago is commonly subdivided into three groups: the Drakoneres in the north, the Modia in the middle and the Ouniades in the south. Administratively, the Echinades form part of two regional units: Ithaca and Cephalonia. Six of the islands, including Oxeia the largest, are owned by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, who purchased them for a reported £7.3 million sterling.

Chun Mee (珍眉) is a popular green tea.  It has a dusty appearance and is generally more acidic and less sweet than other green teas. It was originally produced only in the Chinese Jiangxi province, but is nowadays also grown elsewhere. The tea is divided into several grades with numbers. Some examples are: 41022, 4011, 9371, 8147, 9367, 9366, 3008 or 3009. The number 41022 in this case represents the highest quality while number 8147 consists practically only broken leaves.Teapedia.org Teapedia | Chun Mee
Chun mee tea, together with Assam Bukial tea, has been studied to observe the rate of infusion of caffeine.  The study found that caffeine diffusion through the tea leaves is a greatly hindered process.M. Spiro, D. Jaganyi, M.C. Broom, "Kinetics and equilibria of tea infusion.

The Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL) is Australia's top-level ice hockey league. It is sanctioned by Ice Hockey Australia (a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation) and is run by its own Board of Directors.
AIHL players are semi-professional. Typically this means that players are not paid to play in the AIHL, but receive other benefits such as the use of a car, accommodation, flights/travel within Australia, and other benefits. Often these benefits are supplied or funded by sponsors and vary from team to team.
The AIHL has attracted players up to and including NHL players. AIHL games are shorter than typical hockey games, consisting of two 15-minute periods and a 20 minute 3rd, instead of three 20-minute periods that are usually played under normal North American and IIHF hockey regulations.

CATEGORIES: American cyclists, 1960 births, Living people, American sports announcers, American color commentators, Cycling announcers, Mountain bikers, Sportspeople from Oakland, California

Bob Roll (born July 7, 1960, in Oakland, California) is an American former professional cyclist, author, and television sports commentator. He was a member of the 7-Eleven Cycling Team until 1990 and competed for the Motorola Cycling Team in 1991. In 1992 Roll moved to Greg LeMond's Z team and added mountain biking to his racing accomplishments. Roll continued racing mountain bikes professionally through 1998. Roll is known in the cycling world, and to his global cable television fans, fondly, as "Bobke".
He has written Bobke: A Ride on the Wild Side of Cycling, Bobke II, and two Tour de France Companion volumes. ("Bobke" is Southern Dutch for "Bobby".) He has also had many columns published in VeloNews. He is credited with suggesting that Joe Parkin, professional cyclist and author, move to Europe and wrote the foreword for Joe's first book.
As the accounts of the now legendary story go, in 1998 a young Lance Armstrong, continuing to recover from testicular cancer remediation, had recently dropped out of the Paris–Nice cycling race.  Armstrong's training coach, Chris Carmichael, invited the affable and entertaining Roll to journey to Boone, North Carolina, to talk with Lance and do training rides with the young Armstrong for several days.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/07/25/sports/s122645D20.DTL|title=Coach Remembers When Armstrong Almost Quit|agency=Associated Press|date=2005-07-25[/tpl] Armstrong was extremely discouraged by his recent European cycling results, and Carmichael believed Armstrong had lost his career focus and was on the verge of fully retiring from professional cycling. Almost out of desperation, Carmichael talked Armstrong into doing one last series of intensive training rides, with "Bobke" as his riding partner. Roll was up to the challenge.  Armstrong was a promising future cycling talent and his cycling career was in jeopardy.  
According to Roll, "I am sure Lance had probably never met a bike racer like me...a person who could still find some joy and happiness in such weather misery. We had eight hours a day, for eight straight days, of continuous riding in the pouring rain - rain in Biblical proportions!  I think Lance would've turned things around even without our talks and rides in the Appalachians, but it turned out to be a pivotal career event for him (and Roll had made a new cycling friend)." A refocused and encouraged Armstrong went on to a successful fourth place finish in the Vuelta a España, and within a year and a half he had won his first "yellow jersey" overall victory in the Tour de France road race. (Roll's tale of the ride is in Bobke II;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.missingsaddle.com/2006/05/26/what-about-bob/ |title=Blog Archive » What About BOB? |publisher=MissingSaddle |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2012-07-20[/tpl] Armstrong's is in It's Not About the Bike.Lance Armstrong, Sally Jenkins: It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, Chapter 5, (ISBN 0-425-17961-3), Putnam 2000.)
Roll continues to enjoy riding road and mountain bicycles for recreation, and is a member of the veteran cable television broadcasting team (along with Phil Liggett, MBE and Paul Sherwen) who serve as road cycling expert-commentators for the NBC Sports Network cable network's coverage of the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Paris–Roubaix, Tour of California, and other international cycling road races.
Roll has appeared in a series of Road ID Tour de France television commercials as himself, riding a bus along with "Tour Mania" (a costumed-disguised rowdy faux rock group played by well-known professional cyclists, such as George Hincape).

CATEGORIES: Companies based in Fremont, California, Research support companies, Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area

DiscoverRx develops, commercializes and manufactures reagents and assay kits for the drug discovery market.  Their focus is on lucrative protein target classes, such as G-protein-coupled receptors and kinases.
The company is built around a proprietary technology called enzyme fragment complementation or EFC which forms the basis of the assays that they design and market.  In EFC, two β-galactosidase fragments are employed which are themselves inactive.  One fragment (EA) has an inactivating deletion while the second fragment (ED) has a complementing fragment; in solution where both EA and ED are present, certain pairs of fragments combine spontaneously to form  active complexes.  Some pairs of fragments interact only weakly and combine to produce enzyme activity only when forced into close proximity by virtue of their attachment to proteins which bind to each other.  This property permits evaluation of intracellular protein interactions for use in high throughput screening of drug candidates for their effect on specific cellular pathways. The company offers a wide variety of cell lines that produce such fusion products.

Barrenjoey High School is a co-educational high school located in the Sydney suburb of Avalon, in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia. The campus backs onto the Northern end of Avalon Beach.
The first student intake was in 1968 with a single grade (known at the time as 'Form 1') which formally graduated from the school in 1973. The inaugural Graduating year of 1973 remains closeknit and has recently held a reunion with an outstanding number of students in attendance (more than 70, close to 40 years after last seeing each other).
The location of the school right at the beach lent itself to many curricular and non curricular beach activities.
Over ensuing years, the school has grown in enrolments to its current level, necessitating expansion of the campus and construction of additional facilities.
Barrenjoey's feeder primary schools include Avalon Public School, Bilgola Plateau Public School and others in the local area.
There appears to be a trend towards increasing achievement at the school, with the class of 2008 achieving 150 Band 6 results in a range of subjects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]

The Khawr Abd Allah ([tpl]Lang-ar|خور عبد الله[/tpl]) is today an estuary, but once was the point where the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (Shatt al-Arab) emptied into the Persian Gulf. Located in the south of Iraq, the Iraq-Kuwaiti border divides the lower portion of the estuary, but adjacent to the port of Umm Qasr the estuary becomes wholly Iraqi. The Shatt al-Arab is now the point where the rivers drain out, east of the Khawr Abd Allah. As it extends northwestward into Iraq, it changes its name to Khawr az-Zubayr, at the location of Umm Qasr. From this point it links by canalagain to the northwest and into the Tigris and Euphrates proper. It forms the northeast coastline of Jazirat Bubiyan and the north coastline of Jazirat Warbah.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title='Abd Allah Khawr|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=16[/tpl] Both of these islands are officially Kuwait, however Iraq does claim them.
It has also lent its name to the maritime Khawr Abd Allah Protocols or KAA Interoperability Protocols first developed by the British Royal Navy between March and June 2008 during the British command of Combined Task Force 158.
The non-legally binding KAA Interoperability Protocols were developed and mediated between the heads of the Kuwaiti and Iraqi navies by Major David Hammond Royal Marines, the then British naval barrister and legal advisor to CTF 158. David Hammond now heads the Maritime Practice at 9 Bedford Row International Chambers, London - http://9bri.com/members/david-hammond. This included the production of the KAA Interoperability Admiralty Chart by Major Hammond and which was subsequently distributed to both countries, having been produced by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. On November 11, 2008, the KAA Protocols were historically signed at Kuwait Naval Base having been verbally agreed onboard HMS Chatham (F87) on 8 May 2008.http://www.cusnc.navy.mil/articles/2008/140.html The signing meeting saw the first formal meeting of the heads of respective navies since before the 1991 Gulf War. Subsequently, the success of the non-legally binding protocols was reported to the US Congress on January 9, 2009 in the Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq Report.http://www.defense.gov/pubs/pdfs/9010_Report_to_Congress_Dec_08.pdf The detail of the text of the KAA Interoperability Protocols has now been made available open source over the internet from leaked US diplomatic documents.http://www.leakoverflow.com/questions/554987/09kuwait465-protocols-assist-iraqi-and-kuwaiti-navies-in

iProvo is the name of the Fiber to the Home service in Provo, Utah. Provo's backbone connects homes and businesses throughout the city, as well as municipal buildings, schools, power stations, and traffic signals. Construction began in July 2004 and was completed within two years. With the exception of new subdivisions not included in the original build out contract, the fiber optic backbone is available in all areas of the city. The network's fiber optic equipment is manufactured by World Wide Packets.
iProvo was run as a public-private partnership. The city owned and maintained the fiber optic lines and fiber optic equipment, while private companies provide television, telephone, and Internet services to homes and businesses. The network had two service providers: Mstar and Nuvont Communications/Veracity Communications.  In 2008, the network was sold to Broadweave Networks. Provo deemed Veracity in default on its contract to buy the network after its security deposit fell below $1.6 million. It was given to Google in 2013 for their Fiber network by the city council..

[[Participating preferred stock]]
CATEGORIES: Corporate finance, Equity securities, Stock market

Participating preferred stock is preferred stock which provides a specific dividend that is paid before any dividends are paid to common stock holders, and which takes precedence over common stock in the event of a liquidation. This form of financing is used by private equity investors and venture capital firms. Holders of participating preferred stock get both their money back (with interest) and the money that is distributable with respect to the percentage of common shares into which their preferred stock can convert. 
Like common stock, preferred stocks represent partial ownership in a company. Preferred stock shareholders may or may not enjoy any of the voting rights of those holding common stock. Also, unlike common stock, a preferred stock pays a fixed dividend that does not fluctuate. Often the dividend  is cumulative.  Thus, the company must pay all unpaid preferred dividends accumulated during previous periods before it can pay dividends to common shareholders. If the company is unable to pay this dividend, the preferred shareholders may have the right to force a liquidation of the company.
Participating preferred is often used as a "bridge" between a company that desires a higher valuation and a VC that believes in a lower valuation. A VC will agree to a higher valuation if it is accompanied by a participating preferred security—essentially challenging the company to earn the upside of the higher valuation. 
The main benefit to owning preferred stock is that the investor has a greater claim on the company’s assets than common stockholders. Preferred shareholders always receive their dividends first and, in the event the company goes bankrupt, preferred shareholders are paid off before the holders of common stock. In general, there are four different types of preferred stock: cumulative preferred, non-cumulative, participating, and convertible.

The Cat Sìth ([tpl]IPA-gd|kʰaht̪ ˈʃiː|lang[/tpl]) or Cat Sidhe ([tpl]IPA-ga|kat̪ˠ ˈʃiː|lang[/tpl], Cat Sí in new orthography) is a fairy creature from Celtic mythology, said to resemble a large black cat with a white spot on its breast. Legend has it that the spectral cat haunts the Scottish Highlands. The legends surrounding this creature are more common in Scottish folklore, but a few occur in Irish. Some common folklore suggested that the Cat Sìth was not a fairy, but a witch that could transform into a cat nine times.[tpl]cite web|last=MacGillivray|first=Deborah|title=The Cait Sidhe|url=http://deborahmacgillivray.co.uk/scotlore_caitsidhe.htm|accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl]
As proposed by British cryptozoologist, Karl Shuker, in his book Mystery Cats of the World (1989), it is possible that the legends of the Cat Sìth were inspired by Kellas cats, which are probably a distinctive hybrid between Scottish wildcats and domestic cats only found in Scotland (the Scottish wildcat is a subspecies of the European wildcat, which is absent from elsewhere in the British Isles).[tpl]cite book |title=Mystery Cats of the World |last=Shuker |first=Karl P.N. |year=1989 |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd. |isbn=0-7090-3706-6 |accessdate=11 July 2012[/tpl] Typical Kellas cats resemble large black wildcats, but with some peculiar features closer to domestic cats, and have probably been present in Scotland for centuries, maybe even some two millennia or more.

CATEGORIES: Containers, Target Corporation

ClearRx is a trademark for a design for prescription drug packaging, designed by design student Deborah Adler as a thesis project and adopted by Target Corporation (with refinements by industrial designer Klaus Rosburg) for use in their in-store pharmacies. The design is an attempt to clarify certain difficult aspects common to most prescription bottles.
Vials have a distinctive rounded-wedge shape and are designed to stand on their caps, with the label folding over the top of the bottle, where the name of the drug is printed in large print for easy identification. A cutout on the back of the bottle includes space for a data card describing the effects and risks of the medication. Fundamental to the design is a colored rubber ring that serves as a color code so different members of a household can distinguish their individual prescriptions. An overall priority is given to distinguishability; the most important information (patient name, drug name, instructions) are placed prominently on the upper half of the label. 
Liquid medicine bottles are not quite as distinctive, but feature a spill proof cap coupled with a dosing syringe that is claimed to be more accurate than spoon dispensing. The liquid medicine bottles also feature the color-coded ring around the neck.
Other innovations include revised warning symbols and labels and a small magnifying strip that can be inserted into the side of the bottle for customers with visual impairments. 
The design won the prestigious "Design of the Decade" award from the Industrial Designers Society of America in 2010. http://curvelive.com/blog/news/ClearRx-wins-Design-of-the-Decade

Inertron is a fictional metallic chemical substance found in the DC Comics Legion of Super-Heroes universe. It is the hardest, densest substance in the DC universe, and is often used by the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th century. The first mention of inertron was in Adventure Comics #336.
Inertron is frequently described as indestructible and impenetrable; however, this only applies to regular humans, lesser superhumans and 30th century known technology, as, on some occasions, Superboy and Mon-El could break an inertron container by using all their strength. In Adventure Comics #370, though, a triple steel layer inertron-sealed prison was described as too tough for Superboy or Mon-El to break through. Matter Eater Lad has been shown to be able to eat it, however.

The 2nd Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in central and southwestern South Carolina.  The district spans from Columbia to the South Carolina side of the Augusta, Georgia metropolitan area.
From 1993 to 2013 it included all of Lexington, Jasper, Hampton, Allendale and Barnwell counties; most of Richland and Beaufort counties and parts of Aiken, Calhoun and Orangeburg counties.  Besides Columbia (60 percent of which was in the district), major cities in the district were Beaufort and Hilton Head Island.  It was made more compact in the 2010 round of redistricting, and now comprises all of Lexington, Aiken and Barnwell counties, most of Richland County, and part of Orangeburg County.
The district has been based in Columbia since 1933, when South Carolina lost a district as a result of the 1930 Census; before then, much of its territory had been the 6th District.  For most of its existence as a Columbia-based district, it was a fairly compact district in the central part of the state.  However, after the 1990 census, most of its black residents were drawn into the 6th District, and the district was pushed well to the south and west to make up for the loss in population.
It has been in Republican hands since 1965, when the district's second-term Democratic congressman, Albert Watson, switched parties.  The district's best-known congressman, Floyd Spence, represented the district for over 30 years and was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee from 1995 to 2001, when he died a few months after being elected to a 16th term.  He was succeeded in a special election by one of his former aides, state senator Joe Wilson, who continues to hold the seat.
Wilson's most recent opponent was Rob Miller.

In 1978, the port was expanded to include 35 berths (five of which were able to be used by the largest container ships at the time).  Today, the port has a depth of 13 metres (43 ft) has 9 gantry cranes and a capacity of 1,500,000 TEUs.
Today, Port Rashid provides berths for general cargo, RoRo and passenger vessels.  In the early 1980s, Port Rashid was supplemented by Port of Jebel Ali, which is further from the commercial centre of Dubai near the Abu Dhabi border.
Adjacent to the port are Dubai Drydocks and Dubai Maritime City.  Both of these facilities were built due to Port Rashid's proximity.  But, in January 2008, it was announced that the port would be redeveloped.[tpl]Cite news |title=Port Rashid will take up new role |url=http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/08/01/10/10180737.html |publisher=Gulf News |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |title=Masterplanners of the Universe |url=http://www.nakheel.com/News/2008_new_era/ |publisher=Nakheel |date=2008-01-20 |accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl]  All cargo operations will move to Jebel Ali Port by the end of March 2008.

Peace on Earth is a one-reel 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon short directed by Hugh Harman, about a post-apocalyptic world populated only by animals.
Two young squirrels ask their grandfather (Voiced by Mel Blanc-uncredited) on Christmas Eve who the "men" are in the lyric "Peace on Earth, good will to men." The grandfather squirrel then tells them a history of the human race, focusing on the never-ending wars men waged. Ultimately the wars do end, with the deaths of the last men on Earth, two soldiers shooting each other. Afterwards, the surviving animals discover a copy of an implied Bible in the ruins of a church. Inspired by the book's teachings, they decide to rebuild a society dedicated to peace and nonviolence (using the helmets of soldiers to construct houses). The cartoon features an original song written to the tune of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."
According to Hugh Harman's obituary in the New York Times[tpl]cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDB1039F933A05752C1A964948260 |title=Hugh Harman, 79, Creator Of 'Looney Tunes' Cartoons |publisher=New York Times |date=November 30, 1982[/tpl] and Ben Mankiewicz, host of Cartoon Alley, the cartoon was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.[tpl]cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joseph|title=My Life in "Toons": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|year=1994|publisher=Turner Publishing|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn= 1-57036-042-1|pages= 72–73[/tpl] However, it is not listed in the official Nobel Prize nomination database.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/database.html |title=The Nomination Database for the Nobel Peace Prize, 1901-1955 |publisher=nobelprize.org[/tpl] Mankiewicz also claimed that the cartoon was the first about a serious subject by a major studio. In 1994, it was voted #40 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. It was also nominated for the 1939 Academy Award for Short Subjects (Cartoons). It did not claim that honor (which instead went to Walt Disney's Silly Symphony The Ugly Duckling).

[[Trichuris muris]]
CATEGORIES: Parasites of rodents, Parasitic nematodes, Enoplia

Trichuris muris is a nematode parasite of mice. It is very similar to the human roundworm parasite Trichuris trichiura due to its immunological reactivity when crossed,http://www.biotecharticles.com/Biotech-Research-Article/Trichuris-Muris-Infection-Immune-Response-and-Lifecycle-821.html and so is often used in related studies.Sanger Institute Wellcome Trust - T. muris Project Ingesting material that contains embryonated eggs allows for transmission and infection to occur. The eggs travel down to the cecum - a pouch located at the start of the large intestine - where larval hatching is induced. The larvae proceed to penetrate through the mucosal epithelium, then molt into their secondary stage of infection after 9–11 days. Seventeen days after infection, the larvae arrive at the tertiary stage followed by a quaternary molt 5 days later. The larvae complete their last molt 29 days post-infection and transform into mature dioecious adults. These whipworms utilize their anterior ends to embed themselves into the cells that line the walls of the large intestine. After establishing their place in the intestinal wall, the adult worms mate and release unembryonated eggs into the environment via the feces.http://www.nematodes.org/nembase4/species_info.php?species=TMC
According to research conducted by Hayes et al., T. muris relies on direct contact with intestinal bacteria in order to promote hatching of the embryonated eggs. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and E. coli strains, the authors were able to observe that the bacteria gathered specifically around the opercula, which are located at the poles of the eggs. The bacteria contain type 1 fimbriae, which possess adhesin FimH at their fimbrial tips. FimH interacts with a mannosylated receptor found on the egg's surface. When bound, a signal transduction cascade is triggered and results in the worm emerging from the egg. Temperature, in particular at 37°C, served as an additional hatching cue - this specific temperature is thought to prevent T. muris eggs from hatching in unideal outside environments.Hayes et al 2010 Science 328: 1391
The relationship between T. muris and bacteria also has a significant effect on the host's immune response. In the article Exploitation of the Intestinal Microflora by the Parasitic Nematode Trichuris muris, authors K.S. Hayes et al., treated AKR and SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) mice with enrofloxacin, a fluoroquinoline antibiotic, in order to observe potential effects on worm establishment. The activation of type 2 helper cells (Th2) is decreased in the presence of antibiotics because there are fewer whipworms binding to the intestinal walls. This in turn drives up the proliferation and differentiation of Th17 and Th1 cells. Eighteen days after infection, the worm burden in antibiotically-treated mice was drastically reduced (P

[[Attic style]]
CATEGORIES: Architectural elements, Rooms

In classical architecture, the term attic refers to a story or low wall above the cornice of a classical façade. This usage originated in the 17th century from the use of Attica style pilasters as adornments on the top story's façade. The decoration of the topmost part of a building was particularly important in ancient Greek architecture and this came to be seen as typifying the Attica style. By  the 18th century this meaning had been transferred to the space behind the wall of the highest story (i.e., directly under the roof), producing the modern meaning of the word "attic".

Zayed Port ([tpl]Lang-ar|ميناء زايد[/tpl]) also referred to as Mina Zayed, is a commercial deep-water port owned by the Abu Dhabi Ports Company (ADPC) that serves Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Established in 1968, Zayed Port is located in the northeast section of Abu Dhabi city. It was officially inaugurated and became fully operational in 1972,"Sheikh Zayed Inaugurates Zayed Port", Abu Dhabi Media. Retrieved 2013-06-10 and is named after Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the former President of the United Arab Emirates. The transfer of Zayed Port's container traffic to the newly developed US$7.2 billion Khalifa Port container terminal was completed in December 2012."Khalifa Port now fully operational", Emirates 24/7. 2012-12-09. Retrieved 2013-04-09
Zayed Port covers an area of 535 hectares and contains 21 berths with depths ranging from 6 to 15 metres and a total berth length of 4,375 metres. It's one of four major ports in the emirate: the city's Zayed Port remains the gateway for general cargo vessels, RORO (roll-on/roll-off) and is emerging as a destination for international luxury cruise ship tourism; the nearby Freeport caters to smaller vessels, tugs, barges and service crafts; Musaffah Port is located in the heart of the industrial township of Musaffah; while the new state-of-the-art Khalifa Port in Taweelah handles all the emirate's container shipping.
In light of the increasing importance of container shipping, a well-equipped container terminal was established at Zayed Port in 1982. Covering an area of 41 hectares, the terminal had a storage capacity of 15,000 TEUs at any given time. Four deep water berths were provided with a total length of 931 metres and 15 metres depth. The berths were equipped with five 40-tonne cranes. As a result, Zayed Port's throughput in 1998 increased 34 per cent in container volume and 25 per cent in general cargo over 1997. The port's capacity to hold chilled, cool and frozen products was significantly increased when a 15,000 tone cold store became operational in 1999."Top 10 Middle East Ports", Arabian Supply Chain. 2006-31-10. Retrieved 2013-06-10
Benefiting from its strategic location in the heart of the capital, Zayed Port was instrumental in bolstering Abu Dhabi’s international trade, being the main gateway for trade in the emirate and playing a pivotal role in supporting Abu Dhabi’s Economic Vision 2030, the government’s drive to achieve economic diversification."Mina Zayed celebrates 40 years of success as Abu Dhabi Main Trade Gateway", UAE Interact. 2012-07-10. Retrieved 2013-06-10
As part of this vision, all container shipping in Zayed Port was eventually moved to the Abu Dhabi Ports Company's (ADPC) newly developed AED 26.5 billion AED (USD 7.2 billion) megaproject Khalifa Port in Taweelah between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Following the 100% TEU traffic transition from Zayed Port in September 2012, commercial operations at this new flagship state-of-the-art gateway were officially inaugurated by the President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan on 12 December 2012.Opening of Khalifa Port marks UAE milestone, The National, 13 December 2012

[[Saint-Gaudens double eagle]]
CATEGORIES: United States gold coins, Sculptures by Augustus Saint-Gaudens

The Saint-Gaudens double eagle is a twenty-dollar gold coin, or double eagle, produced by the United States Mint from 1907 to 1933. The coin is named after its designer, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who designed the obverse and reverse. It is considered by many to be the most beautiful of U.S. coins.
In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt sought to beautify American coinage, and proposed Saint-Gaudens as an artist capable of the task.  Although the sculptor had poor experiences with the Mint and its chief engraver, Charles E. Barber, Saint-Gaudens accepted Roosevelt's call.  The work was subject to considerable delays, due to Saint-Gaudens's declining health and difficulties because of the high relief of his design.  Saint-Gaudens died in 1907, after designing  the eagle and double eagle, but before the designs were finalized for production.
After several versions of the design for the double eagle proved too difficult to strike, Barber modified Saint-Gaudens's design, lowering the relief so the coin could be struck with only one blow.  When the coins were finally released, they proved controversial as they lacked the words "In God We Trust", and Congress intervened to require the motto's use.  The coin was minted, primarily for use in international trade, until 1933.  The 1933 double eagle is among the most valuable of U.S. coins, with the sole example currently known to be in private hands selling in 2002 for $7,590,020.

[[TRADIC]]

The TRADIC (for TRAnsistor DIgital Computer or TRansistorized Airborne DIgital Computer) was the first transistorized computer in the USA, completed in 1954.[tpl]cite journal | last = Irvine | first = M. M. | title = Early Digital Computers at Bell Telephone Laboratories | journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 22–42 | publisher = IEEE | location = London, UK | date = July–Sept 2001 | url = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/85.948904 | accessdate = 2009-06-07| doi = 10.1109/85.948904[/tpl]
The computer was built by Jean Howard Felker of Bell Labs for the United States Air Force while L.C. Brown ("Charlie Brown") was a lead engineer on the project,[tpl]cite journal | last = Brown | first = Louis C. | title = Flyable TRADIC: The First Airborne Transistorized Digital Computer | journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 55–61 | publisher = IEEE | date = October–December 1999 | url = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/85.801533 | accessdate = 2009-06-07 | doi = 10.1109/85.801533[/tpl] which started in 1951. The project initially examined the feasibility of constructing a transistorized airborne digital computer. A second application was a transistorized digital computer to be used in a Navy track-while-scan shipboard radar system. Several models were completed: TRADIC Phase One computer, Flyable TRADIC, Leprechaun (using junction transistors in 1956) and XMH-3 TRADIC. TRADIC Phase One was developed to explore the feasibility, in the laboratory, of using transistors in a digital computer that could be used to solve aircraft bombing and navigation problems. Flyable TRADIC was used to establish the feasibility of using an airborne solid-state computer as the control element of a bombing and navigation system. Leprechaun was a second-generation laboratory research transistor digital computer designed to explore the capabilities of new solid-state devices for airborne computers. The TRADIC Phase One computer was completed in January 1954.
The TRADIC Phase One computer has been claimed to be the world's first fully transistorized computer, ahead of the Mailüfterl in Austria or the Harwell CADET in the UK, which were each completed in 1955. In the UK, the Manchester University Transistor Computer demonstrated a working prototype in 1953 which incorporated transistors before TRADIC was operational, although that was not a fully transistorized computer because it used vacuum tubes to generate the clock signal. The 30 watts of power for the 1 MHz clock in the TRADIC was also supplied by a vacuum tube supply because no transistors were available that could supply that much power at that frequency. If the TRADIC can be called fully transistorized while incorporating vacuum tubes, then the Manchester University Transistor Computer should also be, in which case that is the first transistorized computer and not the TRADIC. If neither can be called fully transistorized, then the CADET was the first fully transistorised computer in February 1955.
Flyable TRADIC also incorporated a single high-power output vacuum-tube amplifier to supply clock power to the system. The designers originally devised a system clock using a crystal-controlled transistor oscillator driving a multitude of transistor amplifiers because each transistor was too low powered, but since the phase shift of the amplifiers could not be controlled to the required tolerances this had to be abandoned. So by the same criterion of incorporating vacuum tubes the flyable TRADIC was either not a fully transistorized computer, or followed the after the Manchester University Transistor Computer in 1953. In contrast, the operating requirements for the Flyable TRADIC included performing across a wide temperature range of -55 °C (-67 °F) to +55 °C (+131 °F).
The TRADIC Phase One Computer had 684 Bell Labs Type 1734 Type A cartridge transistors and 10,358 germanium point-contact diodes.  The TRADIC was small and light enough to be installed in a B-52 Stratofortress. It was a general-purpose computer. Programs for the TRADIC Phase One Computer were introduced via a removable plugboard, while the Flyable TRADIC used a Mylar sheet with punched holes — a system reminiscent of punched-card storage. TRADIC could perform a million logical operations every second, close to but not as fast the vacuum tube computers of the day,  using its 1 MHz clock. It operated on less than 100 watts of power and it was much more reliable than its vacuum tube predecessors.

Methodist Boys' School, Kuala Lumpur (MBSSKL) is a cluster secondary school in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was founded in July 1897, making it one of the oldest schools in Malaysia. It is known as MBS and its students are known as MBSians. The school is also known as Marble School or Horley School to the community of Petaling Street. It is noted for its library, which attracts visits from many other schools.
The school was founded by Christian missionary Dr. Kensett in July 1897. The school population grew to be overwhelmingly Indian and the school was named Anglo-Tamil School, at a small wooden shophouse at the corner of Batu Road and Java Street, since demolished.
In 1899, Rev. Abraham became its first headmaster, leading a staff of four teachers. It was then registered as a government-aided school.
Three years later, the MBS proper was founded by Rev. W. E. Horley at the temporary premises of an unused pork market in Malacca Street. The Anglo-Tamil School was absorbed into it, opening up the school to all races.
In 1904, the school decided to move to Petaling Hill (its present site) after a few evacuations by the sanitary board due to the dilapidated condition of the buildings. Within eight months, enough funds had been collected to erect a new building. Two new wings were constructed and a playing field laid down.MBS Centenary Commemorative Book. In 2008, Methodist Boys' Secondary School was awarded the cluster school status by the Malaysian Ministry of Education (MOE).

[tpl]lang|roa|Sercquiais[/tpl] also known as Sarkese or Sark-French ([tpl]lang|roa|Lé Sèrtchais[/tpl]) is the Norman dialect of the Channel Island of Sark (Bailiwick of Guernsey). In the island it is sometimes known, slightly disparagingly, as the "patois", a French term meaning "regional language".
Sarkese is in fact a descendant of the 16th century Jèrriais used by the original colonists, 40 families mostly from Saint Ouen, Jersey,[tpl]ref|colonists[/tpl] who settled the then uninhabited island, although influenced in the interim by Dgèrnésiais (Guernsey dialect). It is still spoken by older inhabitants of the island. Although the lexis is heavily anglicised, the phonology retains features lost in Jèrriais since the 16th century. Most of the local placenames are in Sarkese. In former times, there may have been two subdialects of Sercquiais.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/multilingual/jerriais.shtml#A |title=Voices - Multilingual Nation |publisher=BBC |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2013-07-24[/tpl] It is also closely related to the Auregnais (Alderney) dialect, as well as Continental Norman.
It has suffered greatly in recent years due to a large influx of tax exiles from England who have moved to the island, as well as official neglect.

CATEGORIES: Tensors, Continuum mechanics, Elasticity (physics), Non-Newtonian fluids, Solid mechanics

In continuum mechanics, the finite strain theory—also called large strain theory, or large deformation theory—deals with deformations in which both rotations and strains are arbitrarily large, i.e. invalidates the assumptions inherent in infinitesimal strain theory.  In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the continuum are significantly different and a clear distinction has to be made between them. This is commonly the case with elastomers, plastically-deforming materials and other fluids and biological soft tissue.

Iron Savior is a German power metal band that formed in Hamburg, Germany in 1996. Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/iron-savior-p302825/biography |title=Iron Savior |author=Alex Henderson |work=Allmusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=6 February 2011[/tpl] The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://site.iron-savior.com/band/story/ |title=The whole Iron Savior story |work=Iron Savior |accessdate=25 Juny 2012[/tpl]
Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensrÿche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/biography.php?band_id=226&bandname=Iron+Savior |title=Iron Savior – Biography |work=Metal Storm |accessdate=6 February 2011[/tpl]
Since its inception, Iron Savior has released eight studio albums, two EPs, and two singles. When asked about releasing a live album or a DVD in the future, Piet Sielck responded by showing a disinterest in a live album but shows an interest in a DVD if a good opportunity pops up; ''"it's not like we're so keen about it but never say never." 
Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member.
On February 28, 2014, the band released their newest album titled Rise of the Hero via AFM Records.

[[Anti-Federalist Papers]]
CATEGORIES: Works published under a pseudonym, Ratification of the United States Constitution, Federalist Papers, Anti-Federalism

The Anti-Federalist Papers are a collection of articles, written in opposition to the ratification of the 1787 United States Constitution. Unlike the Federalist Papers written in support of the Constitution, the authors of these articles, mostly operating under pen names, were not engaged in a strictly organized project. Thus, unlike the Federalist Papers, it is a matter of opinion what writings specifically are included and in what order they are best presented. One notable presentation is that by Morton Borden, who collected 85 of the most significant papers and arranged them in an order closely resembling that of the 85 Federalist Papers, e.g. #10 in Borden's arrangement argues against Federalist No. 10. The most frequently cited modern collection, The Complete Anti-Federalist, was produced by Herbert Storing and, at seven volumes, is considered the authoritative compendium on the publications.
Major Anti-Federalist authors included Cato (likely George Clinton), Brutus (likely Robert Yates), Centinel (Samuel Bryan), and the Federal Farmer (either Melancton Smith, Richard Henry Lee, or Mercy Otis Warren). Speeches by Patrick Henry and Smith are often included as well.
One of the major points of the articles was the danger the new Constitution would bring without a statement of individual rights. Some of the Anti-Federalist concerns were addressed in the Bill of Rights, which was added later.

The two writers followed this up with Crossroads, a soap set in a motel, which began on ITV in 1964; the format's principal run lasted until 1988. The writing partners followed it with Champion House, a Yorkshire family saga set in the textiles industry, shown on the BBC from 1967 to 1968. Ling also wrote for Dixon of Dock Green, Sexton Blake, No Hiding Place, Doctor Who ("The Mind Robber", 1968), and, with Sheilah Ward, The Avengers ("Ashes of Roses", "Dance with Death", and "Box of Tricks"). He continued to write for radio, including adaptations of Sherlock Holmes and Gideon Fell stories and the Arnold Bennett novel Imperial Palace, and launched the Radio 2 soap Waggoner's Walk in 1969.Obituary: Peter Link, The Times, 14 September 2006
He published several novels, including the novelisation of his Doctor Who serial "The Mind Robber" for Target Books; three novels in the "Crown House" series, Crown House (1988), Crown Papers (1989) and Crown Wars (1996); three in the "Docklands Saga" or "Watermen" series, High Water (1991), Flood Water (1992) and Storm Water (1993); two stand-alone novels, Halfway to Heaven (1994) and Happy Tomorrow (1995); and bodice-rippers under the name Petra Lee. He also wrote songs, including "Why Not Now?", which was a hit for Matt Monro in 1961. He died on 4 September 2006 after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease.

[[Repetition blindness]]

CATEGORIES: Cognition

Repetition Blindness (RB) is a phenomenon observed in Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. People are sometimes poor at recognizing when things happen twice. Repetition blindness is the failure to recognize a second happening of a visual display. The two displays are shortly shown usually for about 150 milliseconds, and then they are shown within 500 milliseconds of each other (Kanwisher, 1987). [tpl]cite journal|last=Kanwisher|first=N|title=Repetition blindness: Type recognition without token individuation|journal=Cognition|year=1987|issue=27|page=117-143[/tpl]  Repetition blindness tasks usually are words in lists and in sentences. They are called phonologically similar items (Bavelier & Potter, 1992). [tpl]cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=D|coauthors=Potter, M|title=Visual and phonological codes in repetition blindness|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception & Performance|year=1992[/tpl]  There are also pictures, and words that include pictures. An example of this is a picture of the sun and the word sun (Bavelier, 1994).[tpl]cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=D|title=Repetition blindness between visually different items: The case of pictures and words|journal=Cognition|year=1994|issue=18|page=134-137[/tpl]  The most popular task used to examine repetition blindness is to show words one after another on a screen fast in which participants must recall the words that they saw. This task is known as the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Repetition blindness is present if missing the second word creates an inaccurate sentence. An example of this is "When she spilled the ink there was ink all over.” An RSVP sequence participants will recall seeing "When she spilled the ink there was all over." However, they are missing the second occurrence of "ink" (Kanwisher, 1987). This finding supports that people are "blind" for the second occurrence of a repetitive item in an RSVP series.  
For example, a subject's chances of correctly reporting both appearances of the word "cat" in the RSVP stream "dog mouse cat elephant cat snake" are lower than their chances of reporting the third and fifth words in the stream "dog mouse cat elephant pig snake".
The precise mechanism underlying RB has been extensively debated. Nancy Kanwisher has argued that it involves failure to tokenize the second appearance of a repeated stimulus, leading to the second appearance being dropped from short term memory before it can be reported.  However, Whittlesea and colleagues have argued that repetition blindness arises from a failure to properly reconstruct the list, both online and post list.  This failure to properly reconstruct the list arises from the poor encoding cues that are the result of the RSVP task.

[[Ronald Allen]]
CATEGORIES: 1930 births, 1991 deaths, Alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Cancer deaths in England, Deaths from esophageal cancer, English male film actors, English male soap opera actors, English male stage actors, English male television actors, People educated at Leighton Park School, People from Reading, Berkshire

Ronald John Allen (16 December 1930 [tpl]cite web | url=http://jhochet.tripod.com/theronaldallenfanpage/[/tpl] – 18 June 1991) was an English character actor who achieved the status of a soap opera star.
Allen was born in Reading, Berkshire. He studied at Leighton Park School in Reading and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, worked in repertory theatre, had a season at the Old Vic, London and made several films, including the classic about the sinking of the Titanic A Night to Remember (1958).
After roles in the BBC soaps Compact (1963–64) and United! (1966-67) came his best remembered famous role, in the long-running Crossroads (1969–85). Allen played David Hunter, who was a shareholder of the Crossroads Motel with Meg Mortimer, Tish Hope and Bernard Booth. He also twice appeared as a lead actor in the science fiction programme Doctor Who, in the stories The Dominators (1968) and The Ambassadors of Death (1970).
Allen also made a number of guest appearances in The Comic Strip Presents. In the first episode, Five Go Mad in Dorset (1982), which spoofed Enid Blyton's The Famous Five stories, he makes a surprise appearance as Uncle Quentin; deliberately sending up his staid image, he most memorably told The Famous Five, "Your Aunt Fanny is an unrelenting nymphomaniac – and I am a screaming homosexual". (The show's TV Times entry had listed him as "Surprise Guest"). Allen reprised the role in the sequel Five Go Mad on Mescalin (1983), and also appeared in South Atlantic Raiders Part 2 (1990), The Strike (1988) and Oxford (1990), in addition to the feature film The Supergrass (1985). There was much comic mileage to be gained from Allen sending up his conservative image. In a 1987 interview, he said that he was approached by a very intimidating-looking punk who shook his hand and said, "I thought you were really cool in The Supergrass". Then, as he was about to walk away, he turned back and said, almost apologetically, "I loved you in Crossroads too!"
Other roles included television's The Adventures of Robin Hood (1957), Danger Man (1960, 1961), Bergerac (1990) and The Avengers (1964).
Allen lived for many years with the actor Brian Hankins, who also appeared in Crossroads. He was also very close friends with his co-star and on-screen wife, Sue Lloyd. When the British media started to intrude into their private lives, they made it known they were a couple. After Allen was told that his cancer was terminal, they married. He died three months later, aged 60. Sue Lloyd died twenty years later in 2011, also of cancer.

The Hurlingham Polo Association (HPA) is the governing body for polo in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United Arab Emirates and many other countries. The Federation of International Polo produces the International Rules of Polo through a cooperative agreement with the Hurlingham Polo Association, the Asociacion Argentina de Polo http://www.aapolo.com/, plus the United States Polo Association http://www.us-polo.org/.
Within its jurisdiction, the Hurlingham Polo Association is responsible for implementing the rules of polo and for disciplining player who commit infractions against these rules. It also designates handicaps for each of the 2,000 or so players in the UK. It drew up the first set of formal British rules in 1874, many of which are still in existence.
The association originated as the Hurlingham Polo Committee in 1875 (which drew up the first English rules). The Hurlingham Polo Committee was re-titled as the Hurlingham Club Polo committee and expanded to include representatives on the Council from the Services, the County Polo Association (formed in 1898 to look after the interests of the country clubs and to run the County Cup Tournaments), the three London polo clubs - Hurlingham, Ranelagh and Roehampton - and from all associations within the Empire where polo was being played in 1903. Later, in 1925, the Hurlingham Club Polo Committee was re-designated as the Hurlingham Polo Association.

[[Robert Banks Stewart]]
CATEGORIES: British television writers, British television producers, Living people, 1931 births

Robert Banks Stewart (born 16 July 1931) is a Scottish writer for television in the UK, now retired, who was sometimes credited as Robert Stewart early in his career. Banks Stewart contributed extensively to drama for the BBC and ITV for several decades.
Born in Edinburgh, he began writing as a journalist, working for the city's evening newspapers, where he became the youngest news editor in history for the Evening Dispatch. Even then, he used to discuss ideas for television series. Later he became a story editor at Pinewood Studios. Working as a scriptwriter from the end of the 1950s, he worked on such TV series as Danger Man, The Human Jungle, Top Secret and The Avengers ("The Master Minds" and "Quick-Quick Slow Death"). He also contributed a few scripts to the Edgar Wallace Mysteries series of second-features for the cinema.
Working for Thames Televisionp.3 Slide, Anthony  Some Joe You Don't Know: An American Biographical Guide to 100 British Television Personalities Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996 he contributed scripts to the programmes Callan, Special Branch, The Sweeney and Owner Occupied. For HTV, he wrote 5 episodes of Arthur of the Britons. Banks Stewart wrote two highly regarded serials for the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who: Terror of the Zygons (1975) (which was set in his native Scotland and drew on the Loch Ness Monster legend) and The Seeds of Doom (1976) (which was influenced by The Day of the Triffids).
Banks Stewart continued working in television as a writer, script editor and producer, creating Shoestring (1979-80), which ran for two series on the BBC and following this up with the Jersey set detective drama series Bergerac (1981-89). He later produced Hannay (5 episodes, 1988), The Darling Buds of May (4 episodes), Lovejoy (10 episodes) and Call Me Mister. His final credit for television was for the adaptation of My Uncle Silas (2001-3) starring Albert Finney.
At the age of 81, Banks Stewart published his first novel - a thriller entitled The Hurricane's Tail, featuring a British detective called Detective Sergeant Harper Buchanan who uncovers a political plot against the prime minister of a Caribbean island. It was originally envisaged as a two-part TV series, but Banks Stewart said he decided to turn it into a novel after "getting nowhere" with TV executives, which he attributed to ageism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kaleidoscopepublishing.co.uk/press.html|title=Press release |publisher=Kaleidoscope Publishing|date=Undated|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] 
Banks Stewart said: "I always intended Detective Sergeant Harper Buchanan, the main character of my novel, to be the lead character in a TV series, but pitching to various BBC executives in my late-70s was like talking to a brick wall.
"Based on my experience I would say ageism is, unfortunately, common in the TV industry. It seems that if you're over 70 then TV chiefs take it as read that you are too long in the tooth for today's audiences and can't possibly have come up with a possible winner. 
"I've never written a novel before - never had the need to - but in the end it was the only way to make sure my thriller reached the public."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kaleidoscopepublishing.co.uk/press.html|title=Press release |publisher=Kaleidoscope Publishing|date=Undated|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl]

The Indian national rugby union team was admitted to the IRB in 2001, but it took three years before India managed to win a match, beating Pakistan 56-3 in the third tier competition of the Asian Biennial tournament.
In 2005, they started their attempt to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, but a 22-36 loss to Kazakhstan sent them out of the running for that tournament. They also disappointed with an 8-8 tie in Guam, but still finished second in their group of four teams thanks to beating Malaysia 48-12. However, as only the top team in the group qualified for the next stage, India were out. Their current record in IRB-recognised internationals is ten wins, one tie, and twenty four losses.

Andrew Probert (born 1946 in Independence, Missouri) is an artist who is best known for designing the USS Enterprise for Star Trek: The Motion Picture and the Enterprise-D for Star Trek: The Next Generation.
After spending some time in the United States Navy, Probert studied at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.trekplace.com/ap1999int01.html | title=Exclusive 1999 interview with Andrew Probert | author=Greg Tyler |date=August 1999 | work=trekplace.com | accessdate=2006-10-22 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061122113828/http://www.trekplace.com/ap1999int01.html| archivedate= 22 November 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
His first film/TV work was on Glen A. Larson's 1978 ABC miniseries Battlestar Galactica, for which he was recommended by artist Ralph McQuarrie.  For Galactica, Andrew contributed the design for the Cylon Centurions as well as building one of the physical spaceship models for the "ragtag fleet", seen in the opening title sequence of each episode of the series[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl].
In 1978, he was hired by Robert Abel and Associates to work on Star Trek: The Motion Picture, where he worked as a concept designer/illustrator.[tpl]cite web |url= http://oberon.spaceports.com/~tb/international/interviews/interview4.htm  | title=Andrew Probert: two Enterprises and a DeLorean in the resume | author=Salvador Nogueira | date=2001-07-22 | work=trekbrasilis.com | accessdate=2006-10-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20010809192817/http://oberon.spaceports.com/~tb/international/interviews/interview4.htm |archivedate = 2001-08-09[/tpl] When Abel's group was replaced, Andrew survived the transition to the group of new effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull. Andrew was primarily responsible for designing the human and Vulcan space technology seen in the film, including the refitted starship Enterprise, Space Drydock, Orbital Office Complex, Travel Pod, Work Bee support vehicles, and the Vulcan long range shuttlecraft.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.trekplace.com/ap2005int01.html | title=Exclusive 2005 interview with Andrew Probert | author=Greg Tyler |date=June 2005 | work=trekplace.com | accessdate=2006-10-22 [/tpl] His concept sketches for the  bridge set of the Klingon battlecruiser set the style for all future Klingon ship interiors.
In 1983, Probert returned to television, working on the pilot episode of Airwolf (1984). He designed the external fuselage attachments for the Airwolf helicopter, based on a Bell 222, as well as both versions of the internal Electronic Data Command Center, the show's iconic logotype and wolf insignia, flight suit costumes and other miscellaneous items within Archangel's office. He also story-boarded most of the aerial sequences on the show for the 2nd Unit team during the series' run from 1984-1986.

Spartel Bank or Majuán Bank is a submerged former island located in the Strait of Gibraltar near Cape Spartel and the Spartel Sill. Its highest point is currently 56 metres below the surface. 
Spartel Bank is one of the several seamounts in the bed of Gibraltar Strait, similar but deeper seamounts are found at Camarinal Sill and further east. These represent landslide blocks which slid south from the north bank of the Strait of Gibraltar when the strait was formed, possibly through erosion by inflowing waters of the Zanclean flood.
It vanished under the surface approximately 12,000 years ago[tpl]cite news| url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2005/722/1| first=Genevra| last=Ornekas| year=2005| volume=722| issue=1| journal=Science| title=Atlantis Rises Again[/tpl] due to rising ocean levels from melting ice caps after the last Glacial Maximum. It has been proposed by researchers Jacques Collina-Girard and Marc-Andrè Gutscher as a site for the legendary lost island of Atlantis. However, in follow-up correspondence Gutscher indicates that the island could not have been Atlantis, referring to Plato's description of a Bronze Age society, which Spartel could not have supported at the time.http://archaeology.about.com/od/controversies/a/atlantis05_3.htm A detailed review in the Bryn Mawr Classical Review comments on the discrepancies in Collina-Girard's dates and use of coincidences, concluding that he "has certainly succeeded in throwing some light upon some momentous developments in human prehistory in the area west of Gibraltar. Just as certainly, however, he has not found Plato's Atlantis."Nesselrath, Heinz-Guenther Bryn Mawr Classical Review  September 2009 http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-09-64.html

Suzaku (formerly ASTRO-EII) is a Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite launched on 10 July 2005 aboard the M-V-6 rocket.  The project was renamed Suzaku after its successful launch after the mythical Vermilion bird of the South.すざく（朱雀、Suzaku）　命名の理由, JAXA
Just weeks after launch, on 29 July 2005 the first of series of cooling system malfunctions occurred, that ultimately on 8 August 2005 caused the entire reservoir of liquid helium to boil off into space. This effectively shut down the XRS which is the spacecraft's primary instrument. The two other instruments, XIS and HXD, were unaffected by the malfunction, and there are plans to integrate another XRS into the proposed  NeXT X-ray observation satellite planned for launch in 2014.

[[Flowing Hair dollar]]

CATEGORIES: Silver coins, United States dollar coins

The Flowing Hair dollar was the first dollar coin issued by the United States federal government. The coin was minted in 1794 and 1795; its size and weight were based on the Spanish dollar, which was popular in trade throughout the Americas.
In 1791, following a study by Alexander Hamilton, Congress passed a joint resolution calling for the establishment of a national mint. Later that year, in his third State of the Union address, President George Washington urged Congress to provide for a mint, which was officially authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. Despite the authorization, silver and gold coins were not struck until 1794. The Flowing Hair dollar, designed by Robert Scot, was initially produced in 1794, and again in 1795. In October 1795 the design was replaced by the Draped Bust dollar.
In May 2005, a specimen striking from the 1794 production was sold in a private sale for $7.85 million, more than any other coin in history.  On January 24, 2013, a 1794 production was sold for a new record $10 million by Stack's Bowers Galleries, including commission. Rare-coin firm Legend Numismatics was the purchaser.

[[Quaich]]
CATEGORIES: Drinkware, Scottish culture, Sport in Scotland

A quaich [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|eɪ|x[/tpl], archaically quaigh or quoich,  is a special kind of shallow two-handled drinking cup or bowl in Scotland. It derives from the Scottish Gaelic cuach ([tpl]IPA-gd|kʰuəx[/tpl]) meaning a cup.
According to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, the quaich was inspired by the low silver bowls with two flat handles frequently used as bleeding vessels in England and the Netherlands in the 17th century.
Another popular theory suggests that the shape is derived from scallop shells. However, this seems to have had its origins in the now discredited "Poems of Ossian".
In his 1955 monograph "Some Scottish Quaichs",McClenehan, Robert L. Some Scottish Quaichs. Illinois, 1955, p. 3. Richard L. McCleneahan, an American collector, suggests alternatively that quaichs evolved directly from medieval Mazers. This seems unlikely as the form and material (burr maple for mazers) are quite different. There were small stave built drinking vessels common in the medieval period found around the Baltic and since some of the earliest quaichs are stave built this could be the source.thumb|sycamore and silver quaich
Traditionally quaichs are made of wood, an artform known as "treen". Some early quaichs are stave-built like barrels and some have alternating light and dark staves. The staves are held together by bands of willow or silver. They generally have two, and more rarely three or four, short, projecting handles. Other wooden quaiches were lathe-turned out of a single piece of wood and there was another group which were turned then carved outside in basket-weave pattern. In addition to wood, they are made of stone, brass, pewter, horn, and silver. The latter were often engraved with lines and bands in imitation of the staves and hoops of the wooden quaichs. thumb|Oak quaich
The origin of quaichs in Scotland is traced to the Highlands[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011[/tpl]; it was not until the end of the 17th century that they became popular in such large centres as Edinburgh and Glasgow. The silversmiths of such local guilds as Inverness and Perth frequently mounted them in silver, as may be seen from the hallmarks on the existing examples.
Commemorative quaichs awarded as prizes, or given as gifts, are more commonly made of pewter or silver. These prize cups are rarely used for actual drinking.
Related vessels to the Scottish quaich include the porringer, a larger vessel typically [tpl]convert|6|in|cm[/tpl] in diameter with one (US colonial) or two (European) horizontal handles. The Sami and Norrland, Sweden, equivalent is the kuksa, which also only has a single handle.
The quaich was used for whisky or brandy, and in the 19th century Sir Walter Scott dispensed drams in silver quaichs, but the quaich he kept for himself was particularly precious to him.
In 1745 the quaich had travelled from Edinburgh to Derby with the Scottish Army in Bonnie Prince Charlie's canteen.
Some quaichs' bottoms are made of glass, allegedly so that the drinker could keep watch on his companions.  A more romantic quaich had a double glass bottom in which was kept a lock of hair so that the owner could drink from his quaich to his lady love, and, in 1589, King James VI of Scotland gave Anne of Denmark a quaich or "loving cup" as a wedding gift.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence – is it recorded as quaich or loving cup?|date=January 2011[/tpl]

[[Hector de Maris]]
CATEGORIES: Knights of the Round Table

Sir Hector de Maris (or Ector de Maris) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is the younger half-brother of Lancelot and the natural son of King Ban of Benwick and the Lady de Maris. Sir Bors and Sir Lionel are his cousins.
Hector de Maris participates in the Grail Quest, but he is one of the many knights who prove unworthy of achieving the object. In the Quest du Saint Graal of the Vulgate Cycle, Hector and Gawain are traveling together when they come to a ruined chapel where they pass the night. Each has a marvelous dream. The next morning, as they are telling each other their respective visions, they see, "a Hand, showing unto the elbow, and was covered with red samite, and upon that hung a bridle, not rich, and held within the fist a great candle that burnt right clear, and so passed afore them, and entered into the Chapel, and then vanished away, and they wist not where." Jessie Weston found this an "unintelligent" variation on the theme of the perilous Black Hand in other romances in the Grail Cycle.
Hector's adventures in the name of King Arthur were many and wide-ranging. With Sir Morganore, it was Hector de Maris who welcomed Sir Tristram to Camelot  when he was shipwrecked nearby. The two jousted in a friendly competition, but Hector was ashamed to have been beaten by a knight of Cornwall. Other times he was more successful at tournaments, getting the better of both Sirs Palomides & Percivale. He, however, failed to defeat  Sir Turquine and became one of the knights he imprisoned before being rescued by his brother, Sir Lancelot. He returned the favour by rediscovering the lost Knight of the Lake after his period of insanity and returning him to Court.
He is known to have had a long relationship with Lady Perse of the Narrow Borderland, whose fiancé he murdered in order to be with her. Hector later had an affair with the cousin of the Lady of Roestoc, before being reunited with Perse.
When Lancelot is caught in his affair with Guinevere, Hector stands by his brother and leaves court with him. He becomes one of Lancelot's top generals, participating in the battle to rescue the queen at her execution, and the defense of Joyous Guard. Like all his family, he joins Lancelot in France when they are expelled from Arthur's kingdom, and he helps defeat the army led by Mordred's sons after the Battle of Camlann. He was the last knight to join his brother at the Archbishop of Canterbury's hermitage and apparently died there before the others left on crusade.
There is another Hector in Arthurian legend, Sir Ector, the father of Sir Kay and foster father of King Arthur.

[[First Things First (book)]]

First Things FirstStephen Covey, A. Roger Merrill, Rebecca R. Merrill, First Things First: To Live, to Love, to Learn, to Leave a Legacy. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1994. (ISBN 0-684-80203-1) (1994) is a self-help book written by Stephen Covey and A. Roger and Rebecca R. Merrill. It offers a time management approach that, if established as a habit, is intended to help a person achieve "effectiveness" by aligning him- or herself to "First Things". The approach is a further development of the approach popularized in Covey's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and other titles.
The book asserts that there are three generations of time management: first-generation task lists, second-generation personal organizers with deadlines and third-generation values clarification as incorporated in the Franklin Planner. Using the analogy of  "the clock and the compass," the authors assert that identifying primary roles and principles provides a "true north" and reference when deciding what activities are most important, so that decisions are guided not merely by the "clock" of scheduling but by the "compass" of purpose and values. Asserting that people have a need "to live, to love, to learn, and to leave a legacy" they propose moving beyond "urgency" (not the same as the quadrant II in a Cartesian coordinate system).
In the book, Covey describes a framework for prioritizing work that is aimed at long-term goals, at the expense of tasks that appear to be urgent, but are in fact less important. This is his 2x2 matrix: classifying tasks as urgent and non-urgent on one axis, and important or non-important on the other axis.  His quadrant 2 has the items that are non-urgent but important.  These are the ones he believes we are likely to neglect; but, should focus on to achieve effectiveness.
Important items are identified by focusing on a few key priorities and roles which will vary from person to person, then identifying small goals for each role each week, in order to maintain a holistic life balance. One tool for this is a worksheet that lists up to seven key roles, with three weekly goals per role, to be evaluated and scheduled into each week before other appointments occupy all available time with things that seem urgent but are not important. This concept is illustrated with a story that encourages people to "place the big rocks first."
Delegation is presented as an important part of time management.  Successful delegation, according to Covey, focuses on results and benchmarks that are to be agreed in advance, rather than on prescribing detailed work plans.

[[Communication sciences]]
CATEGORIES: Communication studies

Communication sciences refers to the schools of scientific research of human communication. This perspective follows the logical positivist tradition of inquiry; most modern communication science falls into a tradition of post-positivism. Thus, communication scientists believe that there is an objective and independent reality that can be accessed through the method of scientific enquiry. Research conducted under this tradition is empirically based but can be both quantitative or qualitative.
Communication science began in earnest when students of Wilbur Schramm—the founder of the Institute for Communications Research at the University of Illinois—namely David Berlo, came to Michigan State University and founded the first General Communication Arts department in the early 1950s.  Though there are other communication sciences departments elsewhere, Michigan State was the first department in the US that was dedicated solely to the study of communication sciences using a quantitative approach.  It is still one of Michigan State's strongest programs and nationally ranked in the study of human communication.

Dulzura, California is an unincorporated community in San Diego County, California. It is located 25 miles ESE of the city of San Diego, about 10 miles north of the U.S.-Mexican border. Dulzura is derived from a Spanish name meaning "gentleness".[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=109[/tpl]
Although it was also the place of death for former Major League Baseball pitcher Eric Show, it was best known between 1908 and 1914 as the home of a delicacy known as "Clark's Pickelized Figs," a candied fruit that was sold from small firkins at grocery stores across the United States. The figs were produced at Clark Ranch by Frank and Lila Clark. The advent of World War I resulted in a sugar shortage which effectively ended the family business. The Clark Ranch remains in the family to the present day, and the original "Pickle House" is now the ranch office.
The landmark Dulzura Schoolhouse was a one-room fixture in the community from the 1900s until it was closed in the 1950s.
The ZIP Code is 91917 and the community is inside area code 619. The community is largely rural and has a population of only about 700 people.

[[Hot atom]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry

In physical chemistry, a hot atom is an atom that has a high translational energy.
When molecule AB adsorbs on a surface dissociatively, 
In case 2, B gains a high translational energy from the adsorption energy of A, and hot atom B is generated. For example, the hydrogen molecule, because of its light mass, gets a high translational energy. Such a hot atom does not fly into vacuum but is trapped on the surface, where it diffuses with high energy.
Hot atoms are expected to play important roles in catalytic reactions. For example, a reaction of a hydrogen atom with hydrogen atoms on a silicon surface and a reaction of an oxygen atom with oxygen molecules  on Pt(111) have been reported. Hot atoms can also be generated by degenerating molecules on a metal surface with UV light. It has been reported that the reactivity of an oxygen atom generated in such a way on a platinum surface is different from that of chemisorbed oxygen atoms. Elucidating the role of hot atoms on surfaces will lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of reactions.

Phaedra's Love is a play by British playwright Sarah Kane. It was first performed in 1996 at London's Gate Theatre, directed by the author. The play is a modern adaptation of Seneca's Phaedra. The play explores the brutal nature of love, social relations, nihilism and belief through the example of an affair between a queen and her stepson.
It centres more on Hippolytus (the original focuses more on Phaedra), who is rendered lazy and cynical by his upbringing as the son of King Theseus. Unlike classical drama, most of the violent action happens on stage rather than off. 
Kane described Phaedra's Love as "My comedy".

[[Lumpia]]
CATEGORIES: Philippine cuisine, Indonesian Chinese cuisine, Appetizers, Min Nan words and phrases

Lumpia are pastries of Chinese origin similar to fresh popiah or fried spring rolls popular in Southeast Asia. The term lumpia derives from Hokkien lunpia ([tpl]zh|t=潤餅|p=rùnbǐng|poj=jūn-piáⁿ, lūn-piáⁿ[/tpl]), which is an alternate term for popiah. The recipe, both fried and fresh versions, was brought by the Chinese immigrants from the Fujian province of China to Southeast Asia and became popular where they settled in Indonesia and the Philippines.
In the Netherlands, Belgium and France, it is spelled loempia which is the old Indonesian spelling for lumpia and has also become the generic name for "spring roll" in Dutch and French. A variant is the Vietnamese lumpia, wrapped in a thinner piece of pastry, in a size close to a spring roll though, the wrapping closes the ends off completely, which is typical for lumpia.  In Venezuela, it is spelled "lumpia" and it was introduced by Chinese people who migrated to the South American country.

The Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is the leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which has between 12 and 18 million members worldwide, 10 to 14 million of whom are in Egypt. This position was held by Pope Shenouda III until his death on March 17, 2012.  Metropolitan Pachomios, Metropolitan of Beheira and Pentapolis, was chosen as chair of the Holy Synod and to act as locum tenens (place holder) until the election and consecration of a new pope. On November 4, 2012, the Coptic Church elected Theodoros II or Tawadros II as 118th pope.
Following the traditions of the church, the pope is chairman and head of the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria as a first among equals. This organization is the highest authority in the Church of Alexandria. It formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of the church's organization, faith, and order. The pope is also the chairman of the church's General Congregation Council.
Although historically associated with the city of Alexandria, the residence and Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria has been located in Cairo since 1047. The pope is currently established in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, in a compound which includes the patriarchal palace, with an additional residence at the Monastery of Saint Pishoy.
After the death of Shenouda III the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church voted, and the names of the three candidates who received most votes were put in a glass chalice for a name to be picked to be the new Patriarch of Alexandria. The name is picked by 'Divine Choice', by a blindfolded boy believed to be guided by the hand of God.
The liturgy of the Altar Ballot took place on November 4, 2012; the 60-year-old Bishop Tawadoros, auxiliary bishop of Beheira, assistant to Metropolitan Pachomios of Beheira, was chosen as the 118th Pope of Alexandria, to be known as Theodoros II.

McVey ranked alongside Jack Johnson, Joe Jeanette, Sam Langford, and Harry Wills as the top black heavyweights of their generation. All of them, with the exception of Johnson, were denied at shot at the world heavyweight championship due to the color bar, which ironically was maintained by Johnson when he became the first black fighter to win the world heavyweight title. Despite being denied a title shot, McVea enjoyed a famed career that took him across the globe.

[[Thirunamam]]

CATEGORIES: Ayyavazhi rituals

Thirunamam Thiru (word representing sacredness) + Namam (name), --> The Sacred name. It represents the 'Sacred name of God'. The phrase Namam also represents the white clay found at the deeper layer of earth, which is used as the powder to wear a flame shaped mark. The Ayyavazhi people wore this Namam, starting from the central point between the eyebrows, going straight up near the top edge of the forehead.
The flame shape represents Aanma Jyothi or Atman. Which in turn means that, Aatman is considered sacred and as the name of God.  Zealous devotees smeared it on the exterior of the upper arms, over the chest and below the spinal cord area at the back.
This white mark was unlike the one worn by a Hindu of Vaishnavism tradition who wore it on the forehead in the shape of 'U', or of Saivism tradition who wore it horizontally as three parallel lines. This Thirunamam is also called as Tottu Namam and Thiruman.

Each subcamp was named after one of the Frisian Islands: Lager Norderney located at Saye, Lager Helgoland at Platte Saline, Lager Sylt near the old telegraph tower at La Foulère and Lager Borkum, situated near the Impot. 700 people are estimated to died in the camps on Alderney, although it is now believed[tpl]by whom|date=November 2010[/tpl] to have been higher. This was the only Nazi concentration camp on British soil.
Today, little remains of the camp. Three gateposts to the rear of the island's airport mark the entrance - one has had a commemorative plaque attached. Some ruins remain, including a number of sentry posts, some foundations and a small tunnel, which led from the camp commandant's house to the inside of the camp. The commandant's house was later moved to another part of the island.
There are no signs marking the remains of the camp, but it is marked on some maps of the island.

In January 1945, 930,000 were still in German camps. A million at most had been released, most of whom were so-called "volunteers" (Hilfswillige) for (often compulsory) auxiliary service in the Wehrmacht. Another 500,000, as estimated by the Army High Command, had either fled or been liberated. The remaining 3,300,000 (57.5 percent of the total) had perished." and the labourers in those camps were treated harshly but marginally better than the inmates at the Sylt and Norderney camps. Lager Borkum was used for German technicians and volunteers from different countries of Europe. Lager Helgoland was filled with Russian Organisation Todt workers.

The prisoners were from Russia and Europe, usually the east, but including Spanish Republicans.  Some of the few remaining unevacuated Alderney natives (round about 2% of the population) also found themselves in there.  In 1942, Lager Norderney, containing Russian and Polish POWs, and Lager Sylt, holding Jews, were placed under the control of SS Hauptsturmführer Max List.  Over 700 of the inmates are said to have lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to Germany in 1944.
Alderney has been nicknamed "the island of silence", because little is known about what occurred there during the occupation.  The rest of the island was heavily fortified, mainly through the slave labour of the camp inmates.  The German officer left in charge of the facilities, Commandant Oberst Schwalm, burned the camps to the ground and destroyed all records connected with their use before the island was liberated by British forces on 16 May 1945.  The German garrison on Alderney surrendered a week after the other Channel Islands, and was one of the last garrisons to surrender in Europe.  The population were unable to start returning until December 1945.
The States (Alderney's governing body) decline to commemorate the sites of the four labour camps.  Local historian Colin Partridge feels this may be due to the locals' desire to dissociate themselves from the accusations of collaboration.  A faded memorial plate, tucked away behind the island's parish church, vaguely mentions 45 Soviet citizens who died on Alderney in 1940-45, without saying how they died and why.

[[Taenia pisiformis]]

CATEGORIES: Cestoda, Parasites of mammals, Parasitic animals

Taenia pisiformis is a tapeworm.  It is related to Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, and to Taenia saginata, the beef tapeworm.
The adult may reach up to 200 cm in length. 
The definite host is represented by carnivores such as the dog or the cat.
The intermediate host is represented by hares and rabbits, in which we find the mesacestoide (the larval stage) known as: cysticercus pisiformis. This is found in the peritoneum of the intermediate host and can be ingested by the definite host when the dog or cat feeds on the viscera of such an infected intermediate.
Life Cycle
The rabbit host ingests an egg. Then the egg hates in the small intestine, the larval tapeworm go through the intestinal wall and travel to the liver and the blood. The cysticercus develops in the liver for two weeks to four weeks. After that, it comes out into the peritoneal cavity where it attaches to the viscera. Therefore, when the dog, fox, other candis host eats the rabbit and ingests the cysticercus the protoscolex attaches to the small interstinal wall, and then the worm begins to form proglottids. Gravid proglottids, containing the eggs and detach from the end of the worm. Then pass out in the feces.
Common Diagnostic Test
1. Gross examination of the proglottid
2. Fecal flotation may bring up the eggs if a gravid proglottid has been broken in the feces
Clinical Sign
1. Asymptomatic
2. Extremely heavy worm burdens in small dogs my cause blockage of the intestine.
Treatment
Epsiprantel, Praziquantel and Fenbendazole can be treated.

George Christopher Band OBE (2 February 1929 – 26 August 2011Notice of death of George Band (OBE; 1929–2011)) was an English mountaineer. 
George Band was born in Taiwan and educated at Eltham College. He did his National Service with the Royal Corps of Signals and read Geology at Queens' College, Cambridge, followed by Petroleum Engineering at Imperial College, London.  
Having started climbing in the Alps while a student at Queens', he was the youngest climber on the 1953 British expedition to Mount Everest on which Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made the first ascent of the mountain. Two years later, in 1955, he and Joe Brown became the first climbers to ascend Kangchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world. Out of respect for the religious feelings of the people of Nepal and Sikkim, they stopped about ten feet below the actual summit.
Following these early mountaineering successes, George Band spent most of his professional life in oil and gas exploration. In 2005, aged 76, Band made the trek to the south-west Base Camp of Kangchenjunga in Nepal. He was president of the Alpine Club and the British Mountaineering Council, and he traveled around the world. He wrote the books, Road to Rakaposhi and in 2003, Everest 50 Years on Top of the World (the official history - Mount Everest Foundation, Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club). In 2007 he wrote " Summit", a book celebrating 150 years of the Alpine Club. He was Chairman of the Himalayan Trust (UK). George Band was an Appeal Patron for BSES Expeditions, a youth development charity that operates challenging scientific research expeditions to remote wilderness environments.

Fosters Freeze (full name Fosters Old Fashion Freeze) is a chain of fast-food restaurants in California. It was founded by George Foster in 1946 on La Brea Avenue in Inglewood, California, a location that still remains.
The Fosters Freeze name comes from the fact that it is best known for its soft-serve ice milk  and milkshakes, which is reflected in the marketing slogan, "California's Original Soft Serve." Its mascot is an ice cream cone wearing a chef's hat. 
At franchise locations, the company also offers a variety of foods, including hamburgers, chicken strips, and fish. It has not followed the trend of other fast food restaurants in offering a healthy diet menu. 
The restaurant's slogan was "Everything at Foster's is wonderful to eat"; and the slogan has taken on a retro appeal in recent years. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

[[Gaming convention]]

CATEGORIES: Gaming conventions

A gaming convention is a gathering that centered on role-playing games, collectible card games, miniatures wargames, board games, video games, or other types of games. These conventions are typically two or three days long, and often held at either a university or in a convention center hotel.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] The largest gaming convention, Spiel, is a trade fair held in Essen, Germany that focuses on German-style board games and RPGs. A similarly large event is Festival Ludique International de Parthenay (FLIP), a games festival held over twelve days in France.
While games are often a large part of science fiction conventions and other hobby conventions, gaming conventions are distinguished by focusing on games and game-industry guests. The Penny Arcade Expo is the largest gaming convention in the US, with over 70,000 attendees at both its East (Boston) and Prime (Seattle) events. Gen Con has an emphasis on RPGs and features events for RPGs, CCGs, miniatures and boardgames with 36,733 unique attendees over four days in 2011.http://www.gencon.com/2011/indy/sm/press/releases/GCI2011/2011.08.11.Press.aspx Origins focuses on miniatures wargames and boardgames with 11,502 unique attendees in 2011,http://www.originsgames.com/ but also has a large component of RPG and CCG players. DragonCon is an example of a large convention with a focus on popular culture and comics that includes a large gaming contingent and 35,000-40,000 attendees, but isn't dedicated solely as a gaming convention. A smaller genre of gaming conventions are those devoted to the hobby of historical miniature wargaming, many of which are sponsored by the Historical Miniatures Gaming Society.
World Boardgaming Championships, PrezCon and Euro Quest are game conventions representing the hobby of Tournament Board Gaming Open Gaming, Demos, Jr. Events and more dedicated to the face to face board game hobby. The World Boardgaming Championships and PrezCon are considered two of the largest events dedicated solely to board games.

The Infitah ([tpl]lang-ar|انفتاح[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Infitāḥ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-arz|enfeˈtæːħ|IPA[/tpl] "openness") was Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's policy of "opening the door" to private investment in Egypt in the years following the 1973 October War (Yom Kippur War) with Israel.  Infitah was accompanied by a break with longtime ally and aid-giver the USSR — which was replaced by the United States — and by a peace process with Israel symbolized by Sadat's dramatic flight to Jerusalem in 1977. Infitah ended the domination of Egypt's economy by the public sector and encouraged both domestic and foreign investment in the private sector.   The Egyptian Army's cross through the Suez canal in the October 1973/Yom Kippur War, which most Egyptians considered a strategic victory, gave Sadat the prestige to initiate a major reversal of Gamal Abdel Nasser's policies.

[[Synchronous programming language]]
CATEGORIES: Synchronous programming languages, Programming language classification

A synchronous programming language is a computer programming language optimized for programming reactive systems. Computer systems can be sorted in three main classes: (1) transformational systems that take some inputs, process them, deliver their outputs, and terminate their execution; a typical example is a compiler; (2) interactive systems that interact continuously with their environment, at their own speed; a typical example is the web; and (3) reactive systems that interact continuously with their environment, at a speed imposed by the environment; a typical example is the automatic flight control system of modern airplanes. Reactive systems must therefore react to stimuli from the environment within strict time bounds. For this reason they are often also called real-time systems, and are found often in embedded systems.
Synchronous programming (also synchronous reactive programming or SRP) is a computer programming paradigm supported by synchronous programming languages. The principle of SRP is to make the same abstraction for programming languages as the synchronous abstraction in digital circuits. Synchronous circuits are indeed designed at a high-level of abstraction where the timing characteristics of the electronic transistors are neglected. Each gate of the circuit (or, and, ...) is therefore assumed to compute its result instantaneously, each wire is assumed to transmit its signal instantaneously. A synchronous circuit is clocked and at each tick of its clock, it computes instantaneously its output values and the new values of its memory cells (latches) from its input values and the current values of its memory cells. In other words, the circuit behaves as if the electrons were flowing infinitely fast. The first synchronous programming languages were invented in France in the 80s: Esterel, Lustre and Signal. Since then, many other synchronous languages have emerged.
The synchronous abstraction makes reasoning about time in a synchronous program a lot easier, thanks to the notion of logical ticks: a synchronous program reacts to its environment in a sequence of ticks, and computations within a tick are assumed to be instantaneous, i.e., as if the processor executing them were infinitely fast. The statement “a||b” is therefore abstracted as the package “ab” where “a” and “b” are simultaneous. To take a concrete example, the Esterel statement “every 60 second emit minute” specifies that the signal “minute” is exactly synchronous with the 60-th occurrence of the signal “second”. At a more fundamental level, the synchronous abstraction eliminates the non-determinism resulting from the interleaving of concurrent behaviors. This allows deterministic semantics, therefore making synchronous programs amenable to formal analysis, verification and certified code generation, and usable as formal specification formalisms.
In contrast, in the asynchronous model of computation, on a sequential processor, the statement “a||b” can be either implemented as "a;b" or as "b;a". This is known as the interleaving-based non determinism. The drawback is that it intrinsically forbids deterministic semantics (e.g., race conditions), which makes formal reasoning such as analysis and verification more complex. Nonetheless, asynchronous formalisms are very useful to model, design and verify distributed systems, because they are intrinsically asynchronous.
Also in contrast are systems with processes that basically interact synchronously. An example would be systems built based on the Communicating sequential processes (CSP) model, which also allows nondeterministic choice.

Stotfold is a small town and civil parish in the English county of Bedfordshire.
In the 19th century, Stotfold was regarded as a wealthy place. The saying was that to live in Stotfold, one has to have £100 and a pig. The town is divided by a long road,  High Street, which separates the north side from the south. There are two parks and a recreational ground, plus a Multi-Use Games Area (MUGA) and a football pitch.
Stotfold is thought to have gained its name from the northern drovers breaking their journey south at this point on the A1 Great North Road and penning their horses (stots) in enclosures (folds) before continuing their journeys southwards.

Frat House is a documentary film exploring the darker side of fraternity life. The film was directed by Todd Phillips and Andrew Gurland, and largely filmed at Allentown, Pennsylvania's Muhlenberg College; the majority of the film was shot in the house of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, whose charter was revoked in 2000 (although has since rechartered).[tpl]cite news|last=Yang|first = Eleanor |url=http://archives.higheredcenter.org/hecnews/events/000630.html | title = HEC News: Alpha Tau Omega Members Linked to Fights, Hazing, and More| date = June 24, 2000|publisher=Higher Education Center, US Department of Education[/tpl] The opening fraternity, that drove the filmmakers out of the college and the town, is the Beta Chi fraternity on the State University of New York College at Oneonta campus in Oneonta New York. Beta Chi is an unrecognized fraternity in Oneonta, and was kicked off the Oneonta campus after reports of severe hazing. It continues to operate as a rogue, unrecognized chapter in the town to this day. Other unrecognized fraternities from SUNY Oneonta shown in the film include Sigma Alpha Mu, also known as "Sammy", and Tau Kappa Epsilon, which was recognized in the spring of 2007 but shortly thereafter lost their recognition from the campus. Frat House won two Sundance Film Festival awards in 1998, but has been attacked for containing sequences that were staged for the cameras.
Frat House was originally intended to be shown on the HBO TV channel, but was never aired after receiving allegations that much of the final portion of the film was staged. The sequences concerned involved 'hazing', in which aspiring members of the fraternity (known as 'pledges') are seen undergoing humiliating initiation rites. The allegation is that the pledges who appear on screen were in fact already members of the fraternity: the fraternity chapter was paid $1500 to film the events, and several members were paid $50 each to pretend to be pledges and re-enact things that were rumored to happen during fraternity pledging rituals. The filmmakers signed non-binding forms stating that the school and fraternity names would not be used, and that the events did not reflect the behavior of the fraternity. The deceit was noticed because the film was shot in the Spring, but Muhlenberg College did not rush during the Spring.http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/greek/join/
Phillips and Garland claim their film is completely accurate, but they have not refuted the claim that pledging did not happen during the Spring at Muhlenberg College.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]  While not admitting to have done it himself, Phillips argues that staging re-enactments of true events is a technique used by well-known documentarians such as Nick Broomfield and Michael Moore."Are Those Two Fools At It Again?", Cashiers du Cinemart, retrieved July 11, 2005.
Alpha Tau Omega was recolonized at Muhlenberg in October, 2009 and chartered in April 2011.  In August 2012, the chapter moved back into their house after a 12-year absence and was ranked first in overall GPA alongside the Xi Chapter at Duke University for the 2012-2013 academic year.

[[Lager Borkum]]

Lager Borkum was a Nazi concentration camp on Alderney, in the Channel Islands, named after the East Frisian Island of Borkum.
The Germans built four concentration camps on the island, subcamps of the Neuengamme concentration camp (located in Hamburg, Germany). Each subcamp was named after one of the Frisian Islands: Lager Norderney located at Saye, Lager Borkum at Platte Saline, Lager Sylt near the old telegraph tower at La Foulère and Lager Helgoland, situated in the northwest corner of the island. Over 700 people died in the Alderney concentration camps (out of a total inmate population of about 6,000). These were the only Nazi concentration camps on British soil.
Little remains of Lager Borkum now. The gateposts still stand, but now form the entry to the island's tip - the impot.

There is a well-known health farm in Henlow at Henlow Grange, part of the Champneys group. 
There are several theories as to the origin of the name Henlow. Henna hlaw is one, meaning in old English "Hill of birds". Hlow was also sometimes used to indicate a burial place.
The parish church, parts of which are 13th-century, is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin.

Lithiophilite is a mineral containing the element lithium. It is lithium manganese(II) phosphate with formula: LiMnPO4. It occurs in pegmatites often associated with triphylite, the iron end member in a solid solution series.  The mineral with intermediate composition is known as sicklerite (Li(Mn,Fe)PO4). The name lithiophilite is derived from the Greek philos (φιλός) "friend," as lithiophilite is usually found with lithium.  
Lithiophylite is a resinous reddish to yellowish brown mineral crystallizing in the orthorhombic system often as slender prisms. It is usually associated with lepidolite, beryl, quartz, albite, amblygonite, and spodumene of pegmatitic origin. It rather readily weathers to a variety of secondary manganese phosphates and oxides. It is a late-stage mineral in some complex granite pegmatites. Members of the triphylite-lithiophilite series readily alter to secondary minerals.
The type locality is the Branchville Quarry, Branchville, Fairfield County, Connecticut where it was first reported in 1878. The largest documented single crystal of lithiophilite was found in New Hampshire, US, measured 2.44×1.83×1.22 m3 and weighed ~20 tonnes.[tpl]cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P.

[[Quartiere]]
CATEGORIES: Subdivisions of Italy

A quartiere (plural: quartieri) is a territorial subdivision of certain Italian towns. The word derives from quarto, or fourth, and was thus properly used only for towns divided into four neighborhoods by the two main roads. It has been later used as a synonymous of neighbourhood, and an Italian town can be now subdivided into a bigger number of quartieri. The English word "quarter" to mean a neighbourhood (e.g. the French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana) is derived from the cognate old French word "quartier".
Other Italian towns with other than four official neighbourhoods are frequently divided into analogous terzieri (3) or sestieri (6); some towns merely refer to these neighborhoods by the non-number-specific rioni. Quartieri, terzieri, sestieri, rioni, and their analogues are usually no longer administrative divisions of these towns, but historical and traditional communities, most often seen in their sharpest relief in the town's annual palio. Only in a few Italian cities, like in Florence and Bologna, a quartiere is also an administrative subdivision.

Lempel–Ziv–Storer–Szymanski (LZSS) is a lossless data compression algorithm, a derivative of LZ77, that was created in 1982 by James Storer and Thomas Szymanski. LZSS was described in article "Data compression via textual substitution" published in Journal of the ACM (pp. 928–951).
LZSS is a dictionary encoding technique. It attempts to replace a string of symbols with a reference to a dictionary location of the same string.
The main difference between LZ77 and LZSS is that in LZ77 the dictionary reference could actually be longer than the string it was replacing. In LZSS, such references are omitted if the length is less than the "break even" point. Furthermore, LZSS uses one-bit flags to indicate whether the next chunk of data is a literal (byte) or a reference to an offset/length pair.

[[Pessimistic induction]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy of science, Inductive reasoning

In the philosophy of science, the pessimistic induction, also known as the pessimistic meta-induction,  is an argument which seeks to rebut scientific realism, particularly the scientific realist's notion of epistemic optimism.
Scientific realists argue that we have good reasons to believe that our presently successful scientific theories are true or approximately true, where approximate truth means a theory is able to make novel predictions and that the central terms of such theories genuinely refer. The pessimistic meta-induction undermines the realist's warrant for his epistemic optimism via historical counterexample. Using meta-induction, Laudan argues that if past scientific theories which were successful were found to be false, we have no reason to believe the realist's claim that our currently successful theories are approximately true. The pessimistic meta-induction argument was first fully postulated by Laudan in 1981 and survives to this day as one of the strongest arguments against scientific realism.
However, there are some objections against Laudan's theory. One might see shortcomings in the historic examples Laudan gives as proof of his hypothesis. Theories later refuted, like that of crystalline spheres in astronomy, or the phlogiston theory do not represent the most successful theories at their time. A further objection tries to point out that in scientific progress we indeed approximate the truth. When we develop a new theory, the central ideas of the old one usually become refuted. Parts of the old theory, however, we carry over to the new one. In doing so, our theories become more and more well-founded on other principles, they become better in terms of predictive and descriptive power, so that, for example, aeroplanes, computers and DNA sequencing all establish technical, operational proof of the effectiveness of the theories. Therefore, we can hold the realist view that our theoretical terms refer to something in the world and our theories are approximately true.

"Someday (I Will Understand)" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears. It was written by Spears and produced by herself and Guy Sigsworth. The song was released on 2006, by Jive Records, as the sole single from Spears' first extended play, Britney & Kevin: Chaotic (2005). In July 2004, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, later revealing she would be taking another career break to start a family. Spears wrote the song two weeks before knowing she was pregnant with her first child, Sean Preston Federline. A pop ballad, "Someday (I Will Understand)" lyrics refer to a feeling of empowerment as a pregnant woman. A remixed version of the song was included on the 2005 remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes.
"Someday (I Will Understand)" has received mixed reviews from music critics. A few reviewers considered it as a lesson on the singer's history and a "tear-jerker" ballad, while others considered it a non-savable "flop single". The song reached the top ten in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland and also charted in a number of European countries. An accompanying music video, directed by Michael Haussman, premiered on the finale of Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. Entirely shot in black-and-white, the music video features Spears as a pregnant woman and portrays a transformation of her character. Contemporary critics noted the video as a departure from Spears' previous music videos, while comparing the imagery of it to American entertainer Madonna's Kabbalah makeover.

[[Anaerobic lagoon]]
CATEGORIES: Waste management, Sewerage

Anaerobic Lagoon or Manure Lagoon is a man-made outdoor earthen basin filled with animal waste that undergoes anaerobic respiration as part of a system designed to manage and treat refuse created by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Anaerobic lagoons are created from a manure slurry, which is washed out from underneath the animal pens and then piped into the lagoon. Sometimes the slurry is placed in an intermediary holding tank under or next to the barns before it is deposited in a lagoon. Once in the lagoon, the manure settles into two layers: solid, or sludge, layer and the liquid layer. The manure then undergoes the process of anaerobic respiration, whereby the volatile organic compounds are converted into carbon dioxide and methane. 
Anaerobic lagoons have been shown to harbor and emit substances which can cause adverse environmental and health effects. These substances are emitted through two main pathways: gas emissions and lagoon overflow. Gas emissions are continuous (though the amount may vary based on the season) and are a product of the manure slurry itself. The most prevalent toxic gasses emitted by the lagoon are: ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide. Lagoon overflow is caused by faulty lagoons, such as cracks or improper construction, or adverse weather conditions, such as increased rainfall or strong winds. These overflows release harmful substances into the surrounding land and water such as: antibiotics, estrogens, bacteria, pesticides, heavy metals, and protozoa.
In response to environmental and health concerns, the EPA has tightened regulation of the CAFO under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Some states have imposed their own regulation as well. Due to repeated overflows and resultant health concerns, North Carolina banned the construction of new anaerobic lagoons in 1999. There has also been a significant push for the research, development and implementation of Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) which would allow for safer containment and recycling of CAFO waste.

[[Genset trailer]]
CATEGORIES: Electric vehicles, Trailers, Plug-in hybrid vehicles

A genset trailer is a range extending device for use with battery electric vehicles consisting of an internal combustion engine and an electric generator (collectively called a genset).  They run on traditional fuels such as gasoline or diesel and are sized to provide the continuous power requirements for the vehicle they are used with.  Most small to midsized passenger vehicles would require [tpl]convert|15|to|20|kW|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] for unlimited freeway travel using fuel.  Larger vehicles could require [tpl]convert|30|kW|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] or more of power depending on how heavy or un-aerodynamic they happen to be. This essentially converts an electric vehicle into a series-hybrid.
One such trailer is the AC Propulsion backtracking Long Ranger range extending gas fueled trailer, making it a gas-electric series plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.  This trailer used a [tpl]convert|500|cc|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] Kawasaki engine with a [tpl]convert|9.5|USgal|impgal L|abbr=on[/tpl] fuel tank and achieved [tpl]convert|30|mpgus|L/100km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] to  [tpl]convert|35|mpgus|L/100km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|30|mpgus|mpgimp|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|35|mpgus|mpgimp|abbr=on[/tpl]. It is rated at [tpl]convert|20|kW|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] DC output and can maintain [tpl]convert|60|to|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
The setbacks involved with this system are emissions from running the engine (CO2 and other gases), as well as the additional cost of gasoline.  Another setback with this system is the fact that it has to be a trailer, as these are impractical for some drivers.

Walter Bonatti (22 June 1930 in Bergamo – 13 September 2011 in Rome) was an Italian mountain climber, explorer and journalist. He was noted for his many climbing achievements, including a solo climb of a new route on the south-west pillar of the Aiguille du Dru in August 1955, the first ascent of Gasherbrum IV in 1958 and in 1965 the first solo climb in winter of the North face of the Matterhorn on the mountain's centenary year of its first ascent. Immediately after his extraordinary solo climb on the Matterhorn Bonatti announced his retirement from professional climbing at the age of 35 and after only 17 years of climbing activity. He authored many mountaineering books and spent the remainder of his career travelling off the beaten track as a reporter for the Italian magazine Epoca.

Većeslav Holjevac (August 22, 1917 – July 11, 1970) was a Croatian and Yugoslav soldier and communist politician.
Holjevac was born in Karlovac, at the time in Austria-Hungary. He joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1939. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and establishment of Independent State of Croatia, Holjevac was active in resistance movement and in July 1941 he was one of the founders of Partisan units in Kordun and Banovina regions of Croatia. He served as political commisar of Partisan units in that region until the end of war.
The most famous action which Holjevac commanded in 1941, happened on November 17 in Karlovac. He was in command of the platoon whose assignment was to liberate partisan Marijan Čavić, who was wounded by Ustashe, captured and set to healthcare in Karlovac hospital. Holjevac's platoon was redressed in Homeguard uniforms, so they entered Karlovac without problems. Unfortunately, Čavić was taken from hospital before their arrival, so the assignment was not completely executed. However, this action made a high impression within the population of Karlovac and neighbouring places.http://www.znaci.net/00001/10_95.htm
After the war Holjevac served in many important posts in Tito's Yugoslavia. 
For his war service he received the title of People's Hero of Yugoslavia on Jul 23, 1951. The following year he was named mayor of Zagreb, a post he held until 1963. As such, he is credited with many important construction projects that modernised the city, most notably the creation of Novi Zagreb. He also successfully lobbied for establishment of Zagreb trade fair.
Holjevac died in 1970 in Zagreb.
His daughter Tatjana Holjevac used his legacy to successfully launch her own political career during the 2005 local elections in Zagreb.
A major thoroughfare of Zagreb, Većeslav Holjevac Avenue is named after Većeslav Holjevac.
In November 2010, a citizen's group filed a criminal report for Holjevac's involvement in the supposed attack on a hospital on November 17, 1941.Klanje je ranjenika iz karlovačke bolnice zločin poput vukovarskogVeljko Zgurić: Obožavani Holjevac je mučio zarobljene Hrvate, Večernji list

A bomb exploded in the center of Milan, near the Duomo. Sixteen died. The police blamed the anarchists, one of whom, Giovanni Pinelli, they seized. Later on he was thrown from a window at police headquarters. There is considerable evidence that Pinelli’s death was murder, not an accident as the police claimed, so the title Accidental Death of an Anarchist, is ironic.

Jeong Seon (1676–1759) was a well-known Korean landscape painter, also known as by his pen name Gyeomjae (meaning humble study). He was one of the few known Korean painters to depart from traditional Chinese styles. It is reported that he frequently left his studio and painted the world around him, as he could see it. Soon, Jeong Seon inspired other Korean artists to follow suit, leaving a lasting impact on Korean art of the Joseon era.
In contrast to most painters at the time, Jeong Seon was not born in a wealthy family. He was discovered by an aristocratic neighbour who recommended him to the court. Soon he gained an official position.
Jeong is said to have painted daily, with a prolific output until his old age. His paintings are classified as Southern School, but during his life, Jeong developed his own style: unique brush wrinkles of bold strokes in parallels.

[[Sampled data systems]]
CATEGORIES: Control theory, Control engineering, Systems engineering, Systems theory

In systems science, a  sampled-data system is a control system in which continuous-time plant (control theory) is controlled with a digital device. Under periodic sampling, the sampled-data system is time-varying but also periodic; thus, it may be modeled by a simplified discrete-time system obtained by discretizing the plant. However, this discrete model does not capture the inter-sample behavior of the real system, which may be critical in a number of applications.
The analysis of sampled-data systems incorporating full-time information leads to challenging control problems with a rich mathematical structure. Many of these problems have only been solved recently.

CATEGORIES: Probability theorems, Combinatorics, Lemmas

In probability theory, if a large number of events are all independent of one another and each has probability less than 1, then there is a positive (possibly small) probability that none of the events will occur. The Lovász local lemma (a weaker version was proved in 1975 by László Lovász and Paul Erdős in the article Problems and results on 3-chromatic hypergraphs and some related questions) allows one to relax the independence condition slightly: As long as the events are "mostly" independent from one another and aren't individually too likely, then there will still be a positive probability that none of them occurs.  It is most commonly used in the probabilistic method, in particular to give existence proofs.
There are several different versions of the lemma.  The simplest and most frequently used is the symmetric version given below.  For other versions, see [tpl]harv|Alon|Spencer|2000[/tpl].

Timothy Ha Wing-ho MBE, JP  (Chinese: 夏永豪, Pinyin: Xia Yonghao), born in 1937, is the former Supervisor and Principal of St. Paul's College, Hong Kong, as well as Education Secretary of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (Hong Kong Anglican Church (Episcopal)) and Chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Sponsoring Bodies of Schools.  Ha, who is in his late 60s, is still a prominent figure in the education sector of Hong Kong and has recently been very outspoken, in particular concerning the government’s proposed education reforms.
Timothy Ha received his early education in Munsang College and Diocesan Boys' School (DBS).  He was then admitted to The University of Hong Kong, where he studied history.  Upon attaining his BA degree, he started his career as a teacher in DBS, in 1960.  In 1968, Ha was appointed Principal of St. Paul’s College, which is the flagship school of the Anglican Church and oldest educational institution in Hong Kong, and also the alma mater of his father and grandfather.
Under Ha’s leadership, St. Paul’s College underwent several major projects, including renovations and restructuring of the school premises as well as changes to the school management and funding structure, by participation in the Direct Subsidy Scheme in 2002.
Outside St. Paul’s College, Ha has also been very active in education-related policy making.  He has served as either chairman or member of many education-related committees.  In 1991, he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council (i.e. legislature of Hong Kong) by the then Governor to serve a four-year term.  In 1994, Ha was involved in an incident concerning his expenses claim of public funds to buy electronic Bibles.  Ha managed to withstand media criticism, but had not gone for a second term in the LegCo as all appointed seats in LegCo were turned to elected seats in 1995.
Timothy Ha was also involved in tertiary education.  He took part in the establishment committee of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  Indeed, he was the one to give the university its current name.  He has been a member of the Court of The University of Hong Kong.
As the Education Secretary of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, he has been responsible for the education policies of the Anglican Church, which is currently the second largest sponsoring body of schools, after the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong.  Recently, the government has suggested major education reforms including the restructuring of school governing boards and the taking over of school management controls.  Ha, representing the Anglican Church, joined the outspoken Bishop Zen Ze-kiun of the Catholic Church in opposing the School-Based Management Policy reforms, including threatening to take legal actions to deter the government’s initiatives.
Timothy Ha was originally expected to retire as Supervisor and Principal of St. Paul’s College in August 2005, after 37 years of service.  However, the Principal-elect abruptly turned down the offer in June 2005 and Ha was expected to continue to serve for at least one more academic year, even after the hosting of a farewell dinner in his honour on July 9, 2005.  On December 19, 2005, Ha announced that he shall be retiring on March 1, 2006, and Dr. John Richard Kennard will succeed his principalship.
Ha was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1986 and was honoured with an MBE in 1989.

It was created as a coalition government between the Polish Communists and Stanisław Mikołajczyk's faction. It followed the understandings reached by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union during the Yalta Conference.
The TRJN was a result of the negotiations held in Moscow between the Polish Communists, the Soviet Union, and Stanisław Mikołajczyk's faction from 17 June to 21 June.  The Polish government-in-exile did not recognize the TRJN.Peter Stachura The Poles in Britain 1940-2000 ISBN 0-7146-8444-9 Page 7 A few of its members, including the former Prime Minister of Poland Stanisław Mikołajczyk, decided to trust the Soviets and enter into negotiations with them, only to be betrayed later. Mikołajczyk's main power base was the Polish People's Party, a centrist organization and continuation of the prewar Polish agrarian movement.  
The Communists had no intention of giving the opposition any real power, or carrying out the promised 'free and fair' elections.  The members of the opposition that received government positions were kept in check by their deputies and staff, loyal to the Communists, so they had little real power.
On 21 June, General Leopold Okulicki, former Commander of the Polish Home Army was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment in Moscow for the alleged sabotage against the Soviet Army.  Ten other Poles were given similar sentences in the staged Trial of the Sixteen.  On 24 December 1946, Okulicki died in Butyrka prison.
The TRJN was already bound by the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Help and Cooperation signed by its predecessor, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, on 21 April.  This treaty formed the basis for Soviet interference in Poland's internal politics for the next 40 years.
The TRJN government was composed of:
The entire government was composed of:
On 5 July 1945, the TRJN was recognized by the USA. It was soon also recognized by the other Allies, France and the United Kingdom. It was not recognized by the Vatican.
On 6 July, while the Polish government-in-exile maintained its existence, both the United States and the United Kingdom formally withdrew the recognition of it.
On 10 July, Osóbka-Morawski announced the expulsion of all Germans from Poland.
From 17 July to 2 August, a delegation from the TRJN attended the 1945 Potsdam Conference.  
On 16 August, a Soviet-Polish border agreement was signed in Moscow.  Before the end of August, Poland agreed to cede the eastern provinces to the Soviet Union and officially recognized the eastern border based on a slightly modified Curzon line.
On 16 October, delegates of the TRJN signed the United Nations Charter and Poland became a member of the United Nations.
The 'free and fair' elections promised by the TRJN were postponed until the Communists were sure they could control the election process. In the meantime, they increased repressions of opposition members, who were bribed, threatened, delegalised or even murdered. In the words of Gomułka, the goal of the communists was to be the "hegemon of the nation" and nothing would stop them.  On 30 June 1946, they tested their control during the 3xTAK referendum, the results of which were falsified and a 68% support was claimed.
Two great reforms carried out by TRJN were the nationalization decree and Three-Year Plan (of 1947–49), both created in 1946.  The nationalization decree gave the government control over every enterprise which employed more than 50 people; by the end of the year, 90% of the country's industry was controlled by the government.
On 19 January 1947, after the rigged Polish legislative elections of 1947, Mikołajczyk party's unsuccessful challenge, TRJN was dissolved and passed its prerogatives as the government of Poland to the new government headed by Józef Cyrankiewicz. Cyrankiewicz's government was nominated by the new parliament, Sejm Ustawodawczy, which replaced the previously existing Krajowa Rada Narodowa.

St John Ambulance Australia (also known as St John First Aid) (SJAA) is a self-funding charitable organisation dedicated to helping people in sickness, distress, suffering or danger. It is part of an international organisation that consists of eight Priories that form the Order of St John.
St John First Aid training centres were established in Australia in the late 19th century. On the 13 June 1883 a public meeting was held in the Melbourne Town Hall to form a local branch of the association. By the end of June 1883, a centre had been established under the leadership of Edward Neild.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stjohn.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10&Itemid=19 |title= History |publisher=St John Ambulance Australia |accessdate=28 April 2009[/tpl]
The first division of the St John Ambulance Brigade (now known as first aid services/operations branch) was established in Glebe, New South Wales in 1903. A division of this organisation is still in operation today and is known as St John Ambulance Glebe Division. After this initial division was established other states followed suit, with divisions being set up in other states soon after. In 1987, the organisation adopted a single public title, "St John Ambulance Australia". The cadet movement was established in Australia in 1925 with a division in Glebe, NSW. The first Grand Prior's Badge issued outside the UK went to a cadet from Marrickville Cadet Division in 1933 named Marion Higgins.
In 2005, it was decided that the organisation would adopt a corporate structure with closer relationships between the branches of St John, known as 'One St John'.

[[Lactide]]
CATEGORIES: Lactones, Dioxanes, Monomers

Lactide is the cyclic di-ester of lactic acid, i.e., 2-hydroxypropionic acid. Lactic acid cannot form a lactone as other hydroxy acids do because the hydroxy group is too close to the carboxylic group. Instead, lactic acid first forms a dimer, which is similar to a 5-hydroxyacid. The dimer contains a hydroxy group at a convenient distance from the carboxylic group  for the formation of a lactone. Indeed, the dimer readily forms a six-membered cyclic diester known as lactide.  Lactides may be prepared by heating lactic acid in the presence of an acid catalyst.
In general, a lactide is the cyclic diester, i.e., the di-lactone of two molecules of any 2-hydroxycarboxylic acid.

The  University of Montana Herbarium is a herbarium located at the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana. It is open by appointment only.
The herbarium contains over 129,000 plant specimens, and is the world's largest and finest collection of Northern Rocky Mountains flora. Its primary mission is to collect and preserve specimens from the Western Cordillera and Great Plains but collections span a wider taxonomic and geographic range.
About 60% of the 120,000 vascular plant specimens are from Montana itself, a state with diverse plant communities, including Great Plains prairies, Great Basin sagebrush steppes, boreal forests, Northern Rockies alpine communities, and the eastern limit of the moist conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest. The non-Montana collections include many duplicate specimens from Wyoming, Idaho, Utah and Nevada.
The herbarium has a rich history, and its vascular plant collection represents over 100 years of botanical research in Montana, with hundreds of specimens from important early collectors, including C. Bessey, F. D. Kelsey, Marcus Jones and W. N. Suksdorf. That said, however, its greatest strength lies in more recent collections. Over 20,000 (28%) of the Montana vascular plant specimens were collected in the past 30 years by Prof. Klaus Lackschewitz or Peter Lesica. These newer specimens have location data accurate to the nearest square mile, making them a particularly useful resource for ecological and biogeographical studies.

Ida Rhodes (15 May 1900 - 1 February 1986) was a mathematician who became a member of the clique of influential women at the heart of early computer development in the United States.
Ida Rhodes (birth name Hadassah Itzkowitz) was born in a Jewish village between Nemyriv and Tulchyn in the Ukraine. She came to the United States in 1913 and was studying mathematics at Cornell University only six years later.
She received her BA in mathematics in February, 1923 and her MA in September of the same year, graduating Phi Beta Kappa. She later studied at Columbia University in 1930 and 1931.
Rhodes held numerous positions involving mathematical computations before she joined the Mathematical Tables Project in 1940, where she worked under Gertrude Blanch, whom she would later credit as her mentor.
She was a pioneer in the analysis of systems of programming, and with Betty Holberton designed the C-10 programming language in the early 1950s for the UNIVAC I. She also designed the original computer used for the Social Security Administration. In 1949, the Department of Commerce awarded her an Gold Medal for "significant pioneering leadership and outstanding contributions to the scientific progress of the Nation in the functional design and the application of electronic digital computing equipment."
Though she retired in 1964, Rhodes continued to consult for the Applied Mathematics Division of the National Bureau of Standards until 1971. Her work became much more widely known after her retirement, as she took the occasion to travel around the globe, lecturing and maintaining international correspondence.
In 1976, the Department of Commerce presented her with a further Certificate of Appreciation on the 25th Anniversary of UNIVAC I, and then at the 1981 Computer Conference cited her a third time as a "UNIVAC I pioneer." She died in 1986.
In an unusual case of an old specialized algorithm still in use, and still credited to the original developer, Rhodes was responsible for the "Jewish Holiday" algorithms used in calendar programs to this day.

An-Nasir ibn Alnas (died 1088) was the fifth ruler of the Hammadids in Algeria, from 1062 until his death.
An-Nasir succeeded Buluggin ibn Muhammad (1055–1062) after his murder in 1062. After the decline of the Zirids in Ifriqiya as a result of the invasion of the Banu Hilal (since 1051), An-Nasir was able to extend the influence of the Hammadids in the Maghreb. Vassals were installed in Tunis and territory as far as Kairouan came under control. Influence was also built up in the northern Sahara by driving out the Ibadi from Sandrata (1077). With the establishment of Bejaia as a second capital, maritime trade gained importance for the economy. Italian architects and craftsmen were enlisted in the construction of Bejaia. The extensive control of the trade routes led to economic growth and a flourishing of the kingdom. 
However, the stability of the realm was precarious, since the Bedouin Banu Hilal began to infiltrate the Hammadid state after their conquest of Ifriqiya. At first, they were used as mercenaries against the Almoravids of Morocco - even when the Almoravids conquered territory as far as Algiers in 1081, they could be turned back with Bedouin help. But the Banu Hilal could not be kept under Hammadid control, and ultimately caused the downfall of the kingdom.
An-Nasir was succeeded by his son Al-Mansur ibn an-Nasir.

[[Bindle]]
CATEGORIES: Bags, Luggage

A bindle is the bag, sack, or carrying device stereotypically used by the commonly American sub-culture of hobos. The person carrying a bindle was called a bindlestiff, combining bindle with the Average Joe sense of stiff.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
In modern popular culture the bindle is portrayed as a stick with cloth or a blanket tied around one end for carrying items, with the entire array being carried over the shoulder. Particularly in cartoons, the bindles' sacks usually have a polka-dotted or bandanna design. However, in actual use the bindle can take many forms.
An example of the stick-type bindle can be seen in the illustration entitled The Runaway created by Norman Rockwell which appears on the cover of the September 20, 1958 edition of The Saturday Evening Post.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/R/rockwell/rockwell_runaway.jpg.html |title=Norman Rockwell: The Runaway |publisher=Artchive.com |date=1958-09-20 |accessdate=2011-10-24[/tpl]
Though bindles are rarely used anymore, they are still widely seen in popular culture as a prevalent anachronism.
The term bindle may descend from the German/Yiddish word Bündel, meaning something wrapped up in a blanket and bound by cord for carrying (cf. originally Middle Dutch "bundle"), or have arisen as a portmanteau of "bind" and "spindle."http://www.merriam.webster.com/dictionary/bundle

[[The Life and Times of David Lloyd George]]
CATEGORIES: BBC Cymru Wales television programmes, Biographical films, Cultural depictions of British prime ministers, Welsh television programmes, David Lloyd George, 1981 British television programme debuts, 1981 British television programme endings

The Life and Times of David Lloyd George is a BBC Wales drama serial broadcast in 1981 on the BBC1 network and which starred Philip Madoc, Elizabeth Miles, Kika Markham and David Markham.
It featured music by Ennio Morricone, including the theme music ("Chi Mai"), which was a surprise hit in the UK charts, reaching number 2. The opening titles showed an elderly David Lloyd George walking through the Welsh countryside near Criccieth remembering his Uncle Lloyd baptising the young David George (later Lloyd George) in a mountain stream.
The series is in 9 hourly parts covering most of the major events of Lloyd George's life from his birth in Manchester in January 1863 until his death in 1945 in Llanystumdwy. The major events of Lloyd George's life are covered in the production including his personal life, specifically the running of two families. The duration of Lloyd George's political career, of over 54 years, despite the length of the series means that certain periods of history have been skirted over. This is particularly the case with the various Liberal Party splits from 1918 onwards. The historical consultant for the series was the historian A. J. P. Taylor.

[[Administrative centre]]
CATEGORIES: Government, Regions

An administrative centre is a seat of regional administration or local government, or a county town, or the place where the central administration of a commune is located.
In Russia, the term is applied to the inhabited localities which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the republics, for which the term "capital" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term "administrative centre" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in Ukraine.
In the United Kingdom it is the centre of a local authority which is distinct from a historic county with a county town.

In Australia a stockman (plural stockmen) is a person who looks after the livestock on a large property known as a station, which is owned by a grazier or a grazing company. A stockman may also be employed at an abattoir, feedlot, on a livestock export ship, or with a stock and station agency.
Stockmen who work with cattle in the Top End are known as ringers and are often only employed for the dry season which lasts from April to October. A station hand is an employee, who is involved in routine duties on a rural property or station and this may also involve caring for livestock, too. With pastoral properties facing dire recruitment problems as young men are lured into the booming mining industry, young women from the cities are becoming a common sight on outback stations, often attracted by the chance to work with horses.The Telegraph - Jillaroos bring feminine touch to Outback farms Retrieved on 2009-6-9 Some stations are now making changes for the employment of women by building female living quarters and installing hydraulic cattle crushes etc.Campdraft Rules An associated occupation is that of the drover, who, like the shearer may be an itinerant worker, and is employed in tending to livestock while they are travelling on a stock route.  
A station trainee is known as a jackaroo (male) or jillaroo (female),Leconfield 5 day Jackaroo/Jillaroo school and does much the same work as a stockman.

In Sharia (Islamic Law) niṣāb (نِصاب) is the amount a Muslim's net worth must exceed for them to be obligated to give zakat. Several hadith have formulas for calculating niṣāb, the most prominent of which declares that No Zakāt is due on wealth until one year passes. Zakat is determined based on the amount of wealth acquired; the greater one's assets, the greater the tax. Unlike Income Tax in secular states niṣāb is not subject to special exemptions.
In Islam niṣāb is 20 dinārs for gold  and 200 dirḥams for silverThe Minimum Zakatable Amount (Nisab) [tpl]Dubious|date=August 2012[/tpl]. The dinār is a gold coin weighing one mithqal (4.25 grams) and the dirḥam is a silver coin weighing 0.7 mithqal (2.975 grams). The niṣāb is applicable to the cumulative stock of dinārs, dirḥam and any other zakatable valuables, such as merchandise that has been in store for at least one year. As long as the total value of the zakatable valuables exceeds the value of the niṣāb zakat must be paid.

Beaver & Krause were a musical duo made up of Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause. Their 1967 album The Nonesuch Guide to Electronic Music was a pioneering work in the electronic music genre.
Beaver introduced Monkees singer-drummer Micky Dolenz to the Moog, which became a featured instrument on the fourth Monkees album, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd., and Beaver himself performed on one track, "Star Collector" in 1967. In addition, he led workshops at the Beaver & Krause LA studio attended by a who's who of film composers and session keyboardists of the time.
In June 1967, Beaver and Krause set up a booth at the Monterey Pop Festival, demonstrating their newly purchased electronic synthesiser, one of the first constructed by Bob Moog.
Thanks to their demonstrations of the Moog at Monterey, Beaver and Krause also introduced the instrument to a number of other leading American pop acts including The Doors, Simon & Garfunkel and The Byrds, helping to create the vogue for the Moog that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Krause introduced the instrument first to Sir George Martin, producer of the Beatles, and then to George Harrison during Harrison's 1968 visit to California while producing the Apple artist, Jackie Lomax.  He used it to generate his 1969 free-form solo Electronic Sound album for Apple Records' spinoff label Zapple, with the first side of the disc consisting of not only Krause's composition, but also his performance – one that remained completely unacknowledged and uncompensated for.  
In 1968, Beaver and Krause released an album for Mercury Records imprint Limelight Records, Ragnarok, then released a series of three albums for Warner Brothers Records, In a Wild Sanctuary (1970), Gandharva (1971) and All Good Men (1972), effectively creating both the electronica and New Age musical movements.
A variation of the end of their track "Spaced" from the Wild Sanctuary album became the inspiration for dual gliding synthesizer soundtrack for the copied THX Sound Logo in movie theaters, also for which neither Beaver or Krause were compensated.
Both Mike Bloomfield and Ronnie Montrose played guitar on the Beaver & Krause song "Saga Of The Blue Beaver".
The duo ended with Beaver's premature death in 1975, at age 49.
Krause released at least two more solo albums: Citadels in 1979 and Gorillas in the Mix in 1988, plus several movie soundtracks, and now specializes in recording naturalistic sounds, combining them with synthesizers.

[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Awgu]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic Church in Nigeria, Roman Catholic dioceses in Nigeria

The (Roman Catholic) Diocese of Awgu (Dioecesis Auguensis) in Nigeria was created on July 5, 2005, when it was split off from the Diocese of Enugu. It is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Onitsha. Its first bishop is John Ifeanyichukwu Okoye. The St. Michael Archangel Parish Church in Awgu is the largest church in the diocese and will therefore become its cathedral.
The Diocese covers an area of 1,310 km² of the Enugu State, covering the local government areas: Awgu, Agbogugu, Inyi, Ndeabor, Nnenwe, Owelli and Oji Rivers (except the parish of Ukwuoba). Neighboring dioceses are Enugu to the north, Abakaliki to the east, Umuahia to the south and Awka to the west.
The total population in the diocese is 600,000, of which 360,000 are Roman Catholic. The diocese is subdivided into 42 parishes.
Further Information 

|Cathedral of St Michael de Archangel

The people of Awgu geographical circumscription were a
deeply religious people; who before the advent of
Christianity in Igboland had a common religious heritage of
a belief in One, Unseen, Omnipotent God. This Almighty
God was referred to as Ali Awgu (the Awgu earth goddess).
No wonder such popular expressions as “Ali Awgu Chewe
Nwawu” (Ali Awgu protect your child) is common among
Awgu people. This belief and sense of Sacred in this Ali
Awgu is peculiar to Awgu people. This belief and sense of
sacred in this Ali Awgu is peculiar to Awgu religious
tradition permeated and prevailed over the social, moral,
spiritual, mutual and stereological background of the
people before the beginning of the Christian religion.
The remotest beginning of the Catholic presence in the
Awgu division dates back to the acts of the French catholic
Missionaries that came to Eastern Nigeria under Fr. J. E.
Lutz in 1885 pitching their first tent at Holy trinity in
Onitsha. The evangelical activities of these French Holy
Ghost missionaries spread to Enugu Section and
consequently to Awgu sub-section by the early years of 20th
century. The missionary development in Awgu came
mainly from Eke town in Udi division, and partly from
Uturu in Okigwe. What we call Awgu Diocese today is
therefore a historical effect of synthetic, missionary roles
and contributes from Eke and Uturu Catholic Missions.
As early as 1912, Chief Onyeama (the warrant paramount
Chief of Eke town) in his bid to attract Western Education
for his children and people, had gathered a handful of
people (Catechumen) amidst the already existing Anglican
adherents that were found around Eke and Abor towns.
Diocesan Directory 7.
His invitation to the Catholic Missionaries brought Fr.
Joseph Shanahan to Eke in 1914; who laid the first
foundation of the old Eke Parish/School out of which
sprang the spread of other Catholic Missions in the current
Enugu part of Eastern Nigeria. As the incumbent and first
Bishop of Awgu, Rt. Rev. Dr. J. I. Okoye wrote in his B.D.
Thesis, Christianity in Mbanabo, its Advent growth, and
Future, “It was indeed at Eke that the religious tree which
spread its branches to other parts of Enugu Diocese was
planted, watered and nurtured”. Eke Parish was the cradle
of the faith that has today become the Diocese of Nsukka,
Abakaliki, Makurdi, Oturkpo, Ogoja, and Enugu. It was in
1921 that the Roman Catholic Mission set up a
School/Church at Oke-Oli Ali-Awgu (St. Michael’s Awgu)
which attracted over 100 converts in less than one year.
They were received and harbored by Late Chief Chukwunta
Nwachumolie. The first teacher to St. Michael’s
School/Church, Awgu, one Mr. Ofodiamah from Ogwashi
uku of the present Delta State of Nigeria. And the first Holy
Mass at St. Michael’s Awgu was at Oke-Ali-Ohaja Awgu by
Rev. Fr. Grandin.
On the other hand, the missionary movement into Awgu
from Uturu, Okigwe was orchestrated by the
existence/construction of railway line from Enugu to Port
Harcourt in 1915. This made that Ndeabor Railway
Stations a whirlpool of so many itineraries, mercantile and
even evangelical interactions. This created and provided a
pastoral relationship between St. Michael’s Awgu and the
Roman Catholic Mission at Uturu, Okigwe (which was
nearer to Awgu than Eke) which was already established in
1912. In 1926, Rev. Fr. Treich, the first priest to minister to
the faithful at St. Michael’s Church, Awgu from Uturu
prepared Catechumen who received their First Holy
Diocesan Directory 8.
Communion on 21st October, 1926. However, given the
foundation of another Church in Awgu region at Mmaku,
which was raised to a parish status in 1922, St. Michael’s
Awgu was under Mmaku Parish until 1948 when she was
made a parish too. Out of these two sources (Eke and
Uturu), the church continued to spread in Awgu areas with
joyful yet uneasy circumstances, on both sides of the
missionaries and mission converts. There were days of
thug-of-war between native ancestral religion and
Christianity and of oscillation of people from old traditional
civilization and the emerging one that is Christian and
exotic. Given limited pastors and prevalent pressures from
conflicting old and new faiths, it was really martyrdom like
and heroic to be a Christian then. But it was out of these
rocky roots that today we rejoice to the harvest of a young,
buoyant and vibrant Awgu ecclesiastical circumscription.
Awgu was created a diocese by His Holiness, Pope Benedict
XVI on the 8th of July, 2005. On the 29th day of September,
it was canonically erected and Most Rev. John
Ifeanyichukwu Okoye ordained and enthroned as its first
bishop.

[[Test harness]]

CATEGORIES: Software testing

In software testing, a test harness or automated test framework is a collection of software and test data configured to test a program unit by running it under varying conditions and monitoring its behavior and outputs.  It has two main parts: the test execution engine and the test script repository.
Test harnesses allow for the automation of tests. They can call functions with supplied parameters and print out and compare the results to the desired value. The test harness is a hook to the developed code, which can be tested using an automation framework.
A test harness should allow specific tests to run (this helps in optimising), orchestrate a runtime environment, and provide a capability to analyse results.
The typical objectives of a test harness are to:
A test harness may provide some of the following benefits:
An alternative definition of a test harness is software constructed to facilitate integration testing.  Where test stubs are typically components of the application under development and are replaced by working component as the application is developed (top-down design), test harnesses are external to the application being tested and simulate services or functionality not available in a test environment.
For example, if you're building an application that needs to interface with an application on a mainframe computer but none is available during development, a test harness may be built to use as a substitute.
A test harness may be part of a project deliverable. It’s kept outside of the application source code and may be reused on multiple projects.  Because a test harness simulates application functionality — it has no knowledge of test suites, test cases or test reports. Those things are provided by a testing framework and associated automated testing tools.

John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway is a scenic road that connects Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States. It is federally owned and managed by the National Park Service. It is named in remembrance of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., a conservationist and philanthropist who was instrumental in the creation and enlargement of numerous National Parks such as Grand Teton, Virgin Islands, Acadia and the Great Smoky Mountains. 
Created in 1972 through the authorization of the United States Congress, and consisting of 24,000 acres (97 km²), it also borders National Forest lands and is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Caribou-Targhee National Forest borders the parkway on the west and Bridger-Teton National Forest and the Teton Wilderness forms the eastern border.
The land was originally part of Teton National Forest and was transferred to the National Park Service from the United States Forest Service to assure an unbroken National Park connection between Grand Teton and Yellowstone. The parkway road itself extends from the northern end of Grand Teton National Park, through the parkway lands, and then on to West Thumb Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park, a distance of 27 miles (43 km). The 24,000-acre (97 km²) park is managed by Grand Teton National Park.
The parkway is a transitional zone in terms of geology with ancient lava beds being found in the north and the granitic rocks of the Teton Range in the south. The Snake River flows through the parkway as it heads south to Jackson Lake and is considered a prime trout fly fishing area. As in Grand Teton and Yellowstone, grizzly bears, black bears, moose, elk, bighorn sheep and mule deer can be found there. The Yellowstone fires of 1988 affected the northern sections of the parkway consuming 4,000 acres (16 km2). As of 2005, the forest had begun to be rejuvenated and wildlife habitat had actually increased due to better mix of meadow and forest lands. A major relocation project for the Flagg Ranch concession operation (consisting of a lodge, gas station, camp store, cabins and a campground) from along the Snake River to a point higher up and less visible from the road was completed in 2002. Rafting is a popular activity during the summer and guided snowmobile tours use the parkway as a starting point for trips into Yellowstone during the winter.

Beta Draconis (β Draconis, β Dra) is the third brightest star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Draco.  It has the traditional name Rastaban, which has also been used for Gamma Draconis.Rastaban, Stars, Jim Kaler.  Accessed on line September 17, 2008.pp. 207–208, Star-names and Their Meanings, Richard Hinckley Allen, New York, London: G. E. Stechert, 1899. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.79, it is bright enough to be easily seen with the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it lies at a distance of about [tpl]Convert|380|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl] from Earth.
Compared to the Sun, this is an enormous star with six times the mass and roughly 40 times the radius. At this size, Beta Draconis is emitting about 950 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 5,160 K, giving it the yellow hue of a G-type star. The spectrum matches a stellar classification of G2 Ib–IIa, with the luminosity class notation Ib–IIa indicating it lies part way between the bright giant and supergiant stages of its stellar evolution. It is about 67 million years old.
This is a binary star system, with a binary star designation of ADS 10611, in which the supergiant is orbited by a dwarf companion once every four millennia or so.

CATEGORIES: Caithness, Grahams, Marilyns of Scotland, Mountains and hills of the Northwest Highlands, Highest points of historic Scottish counties

Morven (Scottish Gaelic: A' Mhòr Bheinn) is a mountain in Caithness, in the Highland Region of Scotland. The hill is classed as a Graham and, at 706 metres, its summit is the highest point in the county of Caithness.
Caithness is generally quite low lying. Morven's relative height and conical appearance makes it a prominent feature of the landscape as seen from many different places in the county. It is among the most prominent of the mountains that can be seen across the Moray Firth from the area surrounding Buckie on clear days. Indeed, a street in the seaside village of Findochty is named Morven Crescent due to its view of the mountain Morven. Buckpool Golf Club's 5th hole is named Morven and Morven View is a not uncommon house name for properties in the Buckie area with a view over the Moray Firth.
There is also a Morven in Aberdeenshire.
Prince George, Duke of Kent, brother of King George, died in an air crash on a hillside near Morven on 25 August 1942 while serving in the Royal Air Force.

[[The Lavender Cowboy]]

CATEGORIES: American poems, 1923 poems, American country music

"The Lavender Cowboy" was originally a 1923 humorous poem by Harold Hersey about an unmanly cowboy "with only two hairs on his chest" who comes out a hero. It was then set to music and appeared in the 1930 Western film Oklahoma Cyclone. Several versions have since been recorded, and it has been banned from radio airplay because the lyrics are considered suggestive of homosexuality.
"He was only a lavender cowboy
And the hairs on his chest were but two
He wanted to be a real hero 
And do as the real heroes do
Erbecini's and other hair lotions 
He would rub on his chest every night
But when he awoke in the morning
Not a new hair was in sight
He fought for Nellie, your honor
And he cleaned out a whole robber's nest
He died with his six guns a smokin'
But with only two hairs on his chest
Well they buried him out on the prairie
Where the coyotes howl every night
And in the place where his bones lay
Two cacti have grown into sight."
Other versions are somewhat less sympathetic to the hapless wrangler. In one, having failed to impress Nellie, he goes on a binge and breaks into the local saloon at night, "making off with the strawberry gin". This leads to his demise.
"They shot the lavender cowboy  
and said as they laid him to rest
"You're better of now boy 
coz you can't be a cowboy
with only two hairs on your chest"".

St. John the Baptist Church is an abandoned and ruined church presently located within the SEEPZ Industrial Project, Mumbai. It was built by the Portuguese in 1579 and opened to public worship in the feast of John the Baptist that year. It also had an attached graveyard. The church was abandoned in 1840 after an epidemic hit the village. Fr José Lourenço Pais, the then Vicar of Kondivita transferred the church to the nearby Marol village. The baptismal font, pillars and altars were transferred to the new church.
After abandonment, the church fell into decay and vegetation started to take over the ruins.  Despite being abandoned, the native Christians visit the church once every year, as is traditional worldwide.
The church was handed back to Fr Rodney Esperance of Bombay Archdiocese in 2003 by the then Maharashtra Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde.CM gives SEEPZ church back to archdiocese

[[Labour Co-ordinating Committee]]
CATEGORIES: Labour Party (UK) factions, New Labour

The Labour Co-ordinating Committee (LCC) was a factional body inside the British Labour Party established in 1978 and wound-up in 1995. In that period it moved (along with many of its members) from a group established to challenge to leadership of the party from the left to the vanguard of Tony Blair's drive to modernise the party's organisation and policies.
The LCC was established in 1978 to co-ordinate the efforts of the Labour left. As such it was extremely broad including, for instance, members of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, Labour Briefing and the fiercely anti-Trotskyist National Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS).
In 1981 the LCC supported the campaign of Tony Benn against Denis Healey for the deputy leadership of the party, but many were deeply unhappy with Benn's campaign and approach and the LCC began to evolve into a body aiming to rescue the party from the mess it found itself in as the SDP split and Benn's campaign imprinted an image of extremism in the minds of the voters.
The anti-Trotskyism of NOLS were central to this period - as they were able to successfully outmanouvre the far-left groups, having developed the skills in the bitter struggle of the Clause Four Group with the Militant tendency inside the student movement.
In 1983 the LCC organised a major conference 'After the landslide' to examine the lessons from the party's catastrophic defeat of that year: the tone the conference set - that organisational and political modernisation and change were essential wer to become the dominant theme in the party's internal life in the following decade. Robin Cook became the LCC's principal voice in parliament and Peter Hain was a prominent voice outside Westminster. At this time Cherie Booth was also an active member, serving on the LCC executive.
Under Neil Kinnock's leadership the LCC became fully engaged in the struggle against Militant and the LCC was broadly supportive of the leadership, though it backed John Prescott's unsuccessful 1988 challenge to deputy leader Roy Hattersley.
However, the defeat of the Militant left the group without a real cause and membership began to decline, though the group also sponsored the launch of a new discussion journal Renewal in 1993 and firmly repositioned itself as a group of modernisers rather than on the soft left.
In 1998 with New Labour now in power, the LCC voted to wind itself up.

They said that the farm was holy and that they were not welcome. Sigvatr cursed them by saying "may the Trolls take you". The mistress of the household asked him not to insist because she feared Odin's wrath, and that they were pagans. She also told him that they were having the Álfablót and that the Christians were not welcome.

CATEGORIES: Politics of Belgium, Neo-fascism, Pan-European nationalism

Jeune Europe (Young Europe) was an Europeanist movement formed by Jean Thiriart in Belgium. Emile Lecerf, a later editor of the Nouvel Europe Magazine, was one of Thiriart's associates.
Following the Algerian War of Independence Thiriart decided to look to a more Europe-wide vision and founded Jeune Europe as a result, calling for a united Europe that would be "neither Moscow nor Washington" but rather a third superpower in order that the individual states could stop being squeezed in the Cold War.Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, Warner Books, 1998, p. 170 Jeune Europe quickly grew in influence, with major branches opening in France, Italy and Spain as well as minor groups in nine other countries. They also participated in 1962 Conference at Venice, where they agreed to participate in the National Party of Europe, along with Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, Otto Strasser and others.S.J. Woolf, Fascism in Europe, Methuen, 1981p. 363 Jeune Europe as a movement, and Thiriart in particular, also foresaw a future rapprochment with the Soviet Union and hoped that Europe could ally itself with China in order to force this to happen sooner.Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 173
Although Thiriart publicly disavowed fascism and branded Nazism obsolete the movement was still accused of having a fascist basis, be it through adopting the Celtic cross, a symbol widely used in neo-fascism, as its emblem or advertising the activities of neo-Nazi leader Hans-Ulrich Rudel in its eponymous weekly magazine.Lee, The Beast Reawakens,  p. 172 The group also maintained links with the network of former SS officers that organised through the magazine Nation Europa.Woolf, Fascism in Europe, p. 361 However Thiriart's flirtation with China and the Soviet Union alienated some rank and file members for whom links with fascism were not to be eschewed and when he began to follow a more national communist path and seek contact with Nicolae Ceauşescu membership fell.Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 174 Other members went in the other direction, notably Renato Curcio, an early member of Giovane Europa (as the group was called in Italy), who eventually switched allegiance to the communist Red Brigades.Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 182

[[Mouvement d'Action Civique]]
CATEGORIES: Neo-Nazi organizations, Organisations based in Belgium

Mouvement d’Action Civique was a minor far right political movement in Belgium during the 1960s. 
The origins of the MAC lay in the 1960 independence of the Belgian Congo and the resulting Congo Crisis which saw the vast majority of white colonials, who were largely French-speaking, return to Belgium. From within this group a number of extremist organisation began to grow up, most notably the Comité d'Action et de Défence des Belges d'Afrique (CADBA or Committee for Action and the Defence of African Belgians), which had worked against the decolonization of the Belgian Congo. When this aim was not forthcoming (and became increasingly undesirable due to the trouble in Congo and the return of most Belgians) CADBA reinvented itself as the MAC, becoming more of an extremist white armed group.  A minor movement, it worked with Jeune Europe domestically, as well as the British Union Movement and the Organisation armée secrète in France and was a founder member of the National Party of Europe.

The temperature of biscuit firing is usually at least 1000°C, although higher temperatures are common.Whitewares: Production, Testing And Quality Control. W.Ryan & C.Radford. Pergamon Press / Institute Of Ceramics, 1987. The firing of the ware that results in the biscuit article causes permanent chemical and physical changes to occur. These result in a much harder and more resilient article which can still be porous, and this can ease the application of glazes.

[[Guaraná Antarctica]]

CATEGORIES: Brazilian cuisine, Fruit sodas, 1921 introductions

Guaraná is a guaraná-flavoured soft drink, originating in Brazil and manufactured and distributed by Anheuser-Busch InBev. It was created in 1921 by Pedro Baptista de Andrade for Companhia Antarctica Paulista, now part of Anheuser-Busch InBev. The drink is produced only in three countries (Portugal, Brazil, and Japan). It is the second best-selling soft drink brand in Brazil, behind only Coca-Cola, an absolute leader in its segment. Currently, it is one of the 15 best-selling soft drink brands in the world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
It is the most popular guaraná-flavoured soft drink in Brazil, where it is also available as the low calorie version Guaraná Antarctica Zero. Another brand of guaraná-flavoured drinks is Kuat!, which is produced by The Coca-Cola Company and in Brazil is sold through Burger King restaurants and some supermarkets.
Guaraná Antarctica is also available in Portugal, Spain, Honduras, Haiti, Paraguay, Denmark, France, Luxembourg,  Netherlands(Only cans), Belgium, Israel, Italy, Switzerland, Finland, Canada, United Kingdom (recently in all Tesco and Waitrose stores), Sweden, parts of Japan, the United States and as 1.5 litre bottles in special food stores in Germany.
Guaraná Antarctica is the official sponsor of the Brazilian national football team. One of its 2006 commercials featured Argentine football player Diego Maradona finding himself wearing the yellow jersey of the Brazilian team and singing the Brazilian national anthem before waking up and proclaiming it was a nightmare, because he had drunk too much Guaraná the day before. This caused considerable controversy in Argentina.
Another controversial commercial from Guaraná Antarctica was a TV spot showing the guaraná berry plantations in the Amazon region while a narrator explained the basics of the process of producing Guaraná Antarctica and introduced the audience to the guaraná tree. By the end of the spot the narrator turns to the audience and says: "Now ask Coca-Cola to show you the coca tree...", a direct attack on Coca-Cola.
Being high in caffeine,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] the drink has made inroads in the U.S. as a result of the energy drinks craze. Six-packs are sold in most major cities, though they can be difficult to find. The taste is mild, slightly apple-like, with a distinct berry after-flavour. Several websites sell guaraná to Americans. Guaraná Antarctica is by far the most popular form of the drink. [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

[[Saelred of Essex]]

CATEGORIES: 746 deaths, East Saxon monarchs, 8th-century English monarchs, Year of birth unknown

Saelred of Essex (also known as Swebert and Selered) reigned as King of Essex from c. 709 to 746. His claim to the throne was due to descent from Sigeberht II The Good. For part of his reign he probably ruled jointly with Swaefbert, who, it is speculated, may have ruled the sub-kingdom of Middlesex. His date of death is known from an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle although the circumstances are not recorded.
He was succeeded by Swithred, grandson of Sigeheard. Saelred's own son Sigeric succeeded Swithred.
Like his predecessors, he was not an independent ruler, but a dependent of the Kingdom of Mercia.[ref]Barbara Yorke, ‘East Saxons, kings of the (act. late 6th cent.–c.820)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 9 Feb 2008

[[Simon effect]]

CATEGORIES: Perception

In psychology, the Simon effect refers to the finding that reaction times are usually faster and more accurate when the stimulus occurs in the same relative location as the response, even if the stimulus location is irrelevant to the task.  It is named for J. R. Simon who first published the effect in the late 1960s. Simon's original explanation for the effect was that there is an innate tendency to respond toward the source of stimulation.
According to the simple models of information-processing that existed at the time, there are three stages of processing: stimulus identification, response selection, and response execution or the motor stage. The Simon Effect is generally thought to involve interference which occurs in the response-selection stage. This is similar to, yet distinct from, the interference that produces the better-known Stroop effect.

Sixty-one songs have won the Eurovision Song Contest, an annual competition organised by member countries of the European Broadcasting Union. The contest, which has been broadcast every year since its debut in 1956, is one of the longest-running television programmes in the world. The contest's winner has been determined using numerous voting techniques throughout its history; centre to these have been the awarding of points to countries by juries or televoters. The country awarded the most points is declared the winner.Extract from the rules for the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Eurovision.tv. Retrieved on 22 August 2007. The first Eurovision Song Contest was not won on points, but by votes (two per country), and only the winner was announced.Eurovision 1956. Eurovision.tv. Retrieved on 24 May 2008.
There have been 58 contests, with one winner each year except the tied 1969 contest, which had four. Twenty-six different countries have won the contest. Switzerland won the first contest in 1956. The country with the highest number of wins is Ireland, with seven. Portugal is the country with the longest history in the contest without a win; it made its forty-sixth appearance at the 2012 contest. The only person to have won more than once as performer is Ireland's Johnny Logan, who performed "What's Another Year" in 1980 and "Hold Me Now" in 1987. Logan is also one of only five songwriters to have written more than one winning entry ("Hold Me Now" 1987 and "Why Me?" 1992, performed by Linda Martin).O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 ISBN 978-1-84442-994-3 This unique distinction makes Logan the only person to have three Eurovision victories to his/her credit, as either singer, songwriter or both. The other four songwriters with more than one winning entry to their credit are, Willy van Hemert (Netherlands, 1957 and 1959), Yves Dessca (Monaco, 1971 and Luxembourg, 1972), Rolf Løvland (Norway, 1985 and 1995) and Brendan Graham (Ireland, 1994 and 1996).
Winning the Eurovision Song Contest provides a unique opportunity for the winning artist(s) to capitalise on their success and surrounding publicity by launching or furthering their international career. However, throughout the history of the contest, relatively few of these artists have gone on to be huge international stars. The most notable winning Eurovision artists whose career was directly launched into the spotlight following their win were the members of ABBA, who won the 1974 contest for Sweden with their song "Waterloo." ABBA went on to be one of the most successful bands of its time.BBC News (6 December 2005). ABBA's Bjorn says no to reunion. Retrieved on 15 March 2008.

Iron Knob is a town in South Australia on the Eyre Highway across Eyre Peninsula. At the 2006 census, Iron Knob and the surrounding area had a population of 199.[tpl]Census 2006 AUS|id=SSC43801|name=Iron Knob (State Suburb)|accessdate=2009-01-29|quick=on[/tpl]
Iron ore was originally mined here for use as flux in the copper smelting industry.  The iron ore was of such high quality that it started an iron smelting industry as well.  It is referred to as the birthplace of the steel industry in Australia.  It gets its name for the fact that it has a large amount of iron ore and was a major contributor to Australia's iron industry.
Quarrying for iron at the town ended in 1998.  Even though the mine is closed the town remains active.  There is talk about a major mine company finding gold in the area, and there are other iron ore mines elsewhere in the Middleback Ranges. The iron ore was transported by railway to WhyallaIron Knob Tramway Singleton, C.C. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, February, 1942 pp15-17 where it is smelted, or sent overseas via large cargo ships.
New deposits of iron ore were opened at Iron Prince and Iron Duke. Owing to the high price of iron ore the mine has been reopened.
When the mine closed down in 1998 people began to leave the town in the search for work, turning it into a ghost town. However, because of the recent rise in the price of housing, more people are selling their home in the city and buying or building a house in Iron Knob for a lower price. These days, a home can be purchased for approximately A$35,000–70,000 and vacant land can be purchased for less than A$15,000.

[[Karnavedha]]
CATEGORIES: Samskaras, Rituals, Ear piercing

Karnavedha ([tpl]lang-sa|कर्णवेध[/tpl], [tpl]IAST|Karṇavedha[/tpl]) or  Karnavedham is one of the Hindu Samskaras (sacraments) performed for a child.  It is an ear piercing ceremony that occurs in the third or fifth year for some children of Hindu parents. This can still be performed in later years.Pandey, R.B. (1962, reprint 2003). The Hindu Sacraments (Saṁskāra) in S. Radhakrishnan (ed.) The Cultural Heritage of India, Vol.II, Kolkata:The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, ISBN 81-85843-03-1, p.402
Brahmins perform Karnavedha, which is one of the sixteen major Samskaras (rites) during the course of their lifetime.
Brahmins follow these complex rituals in connection with major events in their lives, such as pregnancy, childbirth, education, marriage, and death. The major Samskaras 16 in number are generally known as "Shodasha Samskaras". These samskaras are mentioned in the Vedas, Karnavedha is noted to be performed by male Hindu's as well (see picture). It is stated in the Veda's that Brahmin's male and female, adhere to all Samskaras as they are considered the highest class of the 4 varnas, said to occupy the first position among the four varnas of Hinduism.
Karnavedha not only applies to females but to males as well. Due to modern western influences Karnavedha has become an uncommon ritual overtime amongst males. Karnavedha should still be performed just as Upanayanam (thread ceremony - another major samskara ) or any other Samskara as each holds equivalent spiritual value.
Karnavedha is a Vedic rite of passage. Common between male and females, it is intended to open the inner ears of the child for receiving sacred sounds. This rite has deep mystical and symbolic significance. It is believed that merely hearing sacred sounds has merit in that it cleanses sin and nurtures the spirit.
As years passed, the "Karnavedha" became religious attire so its recital became obligatory and not doing it is regarded as sin in some places. According to a medieval writer, "All the accumulated merits disappear at the sight of a Brahmana through whose ear holes do not pass the rays of the sun. No gift should be given to him in the Sraddha ceremonies. If one gives, he becomes an `asura` or demon."

[[Michael Flessas]]

CATEGORIES: 1959 births, People from Florida, American male film actors, University of South Carolina alumni, American people of Greek descent, Living people

Michael C. Flessas (born June 2, 1959 in Miami, Florida), is the birth name of American actor Michael Flessas, who is of Greek ancestry. Flessas' most notable film role was Angry Man in the Cannes Film Festival 2000 Palme d'Or winning film Dancer in the Dark directed by Danish film director Lars von Trier. Originally, the director himself considered playing the role but, instead, the role was given to Flessas. Dancer in the Dark starred Icelandic singer/actress Björk who won the Best Actress award at Cannes for her role. French film icon, César Award winner, and Academy Award nominee Catherine Deneuve, and other noteworthy artists such as Academy Award and Tony Award winner Joel Grey, Peter Stormare, David Morse, and Stellan Skarsgård also performed in the multiple prize winning film. One of Björk's songs for the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song.
In Iranian actress/director Susan Taslimi's film Hus i helvete (The film's English title: All Hell Let Loose), starring Melinda Kinnaman, which won the Best Feature Film prize at the Brooklyn International Film Festival in 2003, Flessas played the vicious pornographer "Videomannen" in a nightmarish flashback scene in the film.
Flessas also portrayed massive and deadly Russian hitman "Jurij Rostoff" in Beck - Okänd avsändare, a made for television movie directed by Swedish actor and director Harald Hamrell.  Beck - Okänd avsändare was among the popular Swedish Beck detective films and made-for-television movies starring Swedish actor Peter Haber.  As "Jurij Rostoff" Flessas weighed in at 150 kilos in the role as a result of weight training and diet; however, in his younger and less heavy years, Flessas danced in the corps de ballet of the Columbia City Ballet then under the direction of Ann Brodie in Columbia, South Carolina.
Although he won two scholarships in Music, Flessas changed majors and majored in Religious Studies and minored in Philosophy at the University of South Carolina. Flessas did not complete his undergraduate degree at the University of South Carolina yet he continued his studies on an informal basis with travels around the world in order to meet and speak with adherents of various religious forms and philosophical points of view.
Flessas began his professional acting career after hearing a barber mention that a :Fox Broadcasting Company series in Boston was about to begin production. Although the series, Against the Law starring Academy award nominee Michael O'Keefe lasted for one season, Flessas was in six episodes of the show as an uncredited extra. Flessas was able to do six episodes by constantly changing his facial appearance for each episode of the series. Flessas also was an uncredited extra in films such as HouseSitter, starring Emmy Award winner Steve Martin and Academy Award winner Goldie Hawn, :Wind, starring Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson, Matthew Modine, and Jennifer Grey, and the NBC made for television movie MacShayne: Final Roll of the Dice starring Grammy Award winner Kenny Rogers.
Flessas also gained notoriety in the mid 1990s for his creation of a now defunct website entitled "Resources for the Homeless" which was one of the first websites in the United States of America solely devoted to helping the homeless through individual initiative by offering the homeless relevant data on resources via one website. At the time, many poor people were being removed from Milwaukee, Wisconsin welfare rolls while many Milwaukee city officials were engaged in plans to fund and build a new multi-million dollar stadium. Flessas perceived the situation (building a new stadium while removing the poor from welfare) as an injustice to the poor. Given that libraries in Milwaukee, Wisconsin were just connecting to the World Wide Web, Flessas gathered and placed information regarding all the services available to the homeless in Milwaukee on the web so service providers to the homeless and the homeless themselves (who often sought shelter in local libraries) had equal and rapid access to information about resources available in Milwaukee via the Milwaukee County library system computer network "OMNINET". "Resources for the Homeless" was considered an unusual information delivery solution at the time given the new nature of the method of delivery and the biased misperception that the homeless did not and would not use computers to learn about resources available. The "Resources for the Homeless" project in Milwaukee received no direct funding for it was Flessas' express purpose to show what one person with computing skills could do to help the homeless with the use of the web. The project began in Milwaukee on a freenet and, later, a similar site was created with the help of a local web designer in Columbia, South Carolina. Flessas' exploits with the site were reported on television in Milwaukee, WIS television in Columbia, and in an article in Silicon Valley's San Jose Mercury News newspaper.
In a newspaper article in Columbia South Carolina's The State newspaper, Flessas promoted the use of e-mail in the 1990s to broadcast a demand (then akin to what is now guerrilla communication and subvertising) that thousands of potential visitors to South Carolina boycott the state's multi-million dollar tourism industry to force state government officials to remove the Confederate flag from South Carolina's State House dome. (Flessas, curiously enough, through his mother's side of the family, is a descendant of Elisha Jefferson "Elijah" Sutherland who fought with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.) Social and political activism is not unknown in the Flessas Family for Flessas himself (through his father's side of the family) is also a direct descendant of Papaflessas through Papaflessas' father Demetrios Flessas.

The United National South West Party ([tpl]lang-af|Verenigde Nasionale Suidwes Party[/tpl], [tpl]lang-de|Vereinigte Nationale Südwestpartei[/tpl]) was a political party in South-West Africa. It was formed through a merger of National Party of South-West Africa and the South West Party, in order to counter the influence of the German League in South-West Africa. The first congress of UNSWP was held in Windhoek on 1-2 April 1927.
The UNSWP favoured incorporation of South West Africa into South Africa, and won elections to the Legislative Assembly elections in 1929, 1934, 1940 and 1945.Elections in Namibia African Elections Database
With the coming of the National Party of South-West Africa in the late 1930s, some Afrikaners switched loyalties to the new party. Meanwhile, after 1939 the policy of the UNSWP tended to follow Gen. Smuts instead of Gen. Hertzog, in part because of the fear of a new German interest in the territory. It continued to control the Legislative Assembly until 1950, at which point it held fifteen of the eighteen seats. But the National Party had won control in South Africa in 1948, and in 1950 elections in Namibia the National Party won sixteen seats while the UNSWP retained only two (which it lost in 1966).
The main publication of UNSWP was the newspaper Die Suidwes Afrikaner.

[[Crystallographic defects in diamond]]
CATEGORIES: Diamond, Crystallographic defects

Imperfections in the crystal lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond may be the result of lattice irregularities or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. They affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the band theory.
The defects can be detected by different types of spectroscopy, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (photoluminescence, PL) or electron beam (cathodoluminescence, CL), and absorption of light in the infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. Absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0925-9635(03)00262-0[/tpl]

The cost for the whole project was estimated at over HK$200 billion, and the Chinese Government was concerned about its impact on the financial reserve of the future Hong Kong SAR Government. Several changes were made to the plan, including the shortening of the Tsing Ma Bridge and the construction of the Airport Railway as a double-track railway. The project ended up costing HK$160.2 billion (160,200,000,000).[tpl]cite web|url=http://legacy.transparency.org/working_papers/country/hk_airport.html|title=Working Paper: Hong Kong: The Airport Core Programme and the Absence of Corruption|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=11 June 2007[/tpl]
The Programme formally commenced after the signing of a memorandum of understanding between British Prime Minister John Major and Chinese Premier Li Peng in Beijing on 3 September 1991, and lasted 8 years in total. It was the most expensive airport project in the world, according to the Guinness World Records. It was the biggest infrastructure programme in Hong Kong's history.

[[Sinker (baseball)]]
CATEGORIES: Baseball pitches

In baseball, a sinker or sinking fastball is a type of fastball pitch which has significant downward and horizontal movement. The sinker is known for inducing a lot of ground balls.[tpl]cite web |title=In Search of the Sinker |work=The Hardball Times |author=John Walsh |url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/in-search-of-the-sinker/[/tpl] Pitchers who use the sinker tend to rely on it heavily and do not need to change pitch speeds as much as other pitchers do because the sinking action induces weak bat contact. Other pitchers normally change pitch speeds to achieve this effect.[tpl]cite web |title=That Sinking Feeling |work=Baseball Analysts |author=Joe P.

[[Fishing sinker]]

CATEGORIES: Fishing equipment

A fishing sinker or knoch is a weight used in conjunction with a fishing lure or hook to increase its rate of sink, anchoring ability, and/or casting distance. Fishing sinkers may be as small as 1 gram for applications in shallow water, and even smaller for fly fishing applications, or as large as several pounds or considerably more for deep sea fishing. They are formed into nearly innumerable shapes for diverse fishing applications. Environmental concerns surround the usage of lead and other materials in fishing sinkers.

In addition to his work with that band, Brant has also played with artists including Chris Spedding, Robert Gordon, Lou Reed, Diana Ross, Pete Special, Leslie Gore, Micki Free & others. He was also bassist for the band Red Siren (formerly Siren, following their legal band-name change).
After original bassist Tom Petersson left the group in 1980, he was replaced by Pete Comita. Comita left the group in the early recording stages of "One on One" and was replaced by Jon Brant. Though this was the first album to feature Brant, most of it was recorded without him. Guitarist Rick Nielsen played bass on all but three tracks ("Saturday at Midnight", "If You Want My Love" and "She's Tight").
Brant played on all of the tracks of the band's next three studio albums and co-wrote the hit "Tonight It's You" and "This Time Around" from 1985's Standing on the Edge. In 1987, Brant was forced out of Cheap Trick when Sony bought out CBS Epic. He remains good friends with drummer Bun E. Carlos to this day, and the two of them occasionally play together.
Brant rejoined Cheap Trick briefly on stage to play bass during "If You Want My Love" and "She's Tight"  during the band's 25th anniversary concert. In 2004, when Petersson was unable to tour briefly after the birth of his child, Brant re-joined the band for a month of shows as opening act for Aerosmith.  Brant started the tour with Cheap Trick a few days after returning  from a month long tour of bases in the Middle East.  He performed in Baghdad, Djibouti, Africa and the UAE. Brant returned once again in 2007 to Cheap Trick for one show in Augusta, Georgia. 
Brant performed with blues artist Lynne Jordan for several years in Chicago, then played for a few years with new age artist Nicholas Gunn. Brant also competes in the equestrian sport of eventing and runs a horse bedding manufacturing company.
Brant performs with Native American artist Micki Free. The two perform regularly at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florida and other venues around the world.

The Danish filmmaker Carl Th. Dreyer (1889–1968) is considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. Other Danish filmmakers of note include Benjamin Christensen, who outside his native country directed several horror classics including Häxan (1922) and Seven Footprints to Satan (1929); Erik Balling, the creator of the popular Olsen-banden films; Gabriel Axel, an Oscar-winner for Babette's Feast in 1987; and Bille August, the Oscar-, Palme d'Or- and Golden Globe-winner for Pelle the Conqueror in 1988. In the modern era, notable filmmakers in Denmark include Lars von Trier, who co-created the Dogme film movement, and multiple award-winners Susanne Bier and Nicolas Winding Refn.

Brian's Song is a 1971 ABC Movie of the Week that recounts the details of the life of Brian Piccolo (played by James Caan), a Wake Forest University football player stricken with terminal cancer after turning pro, told through his friendship with Chicago Bears running back teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams), who helps him through the difficult struggle. The production was such a success on ABC that it was later shown in theaters by Columbia Pictures,Thomas, Bob. "TV 'Brian's Song' on movie screens," The Dallas Morning News,  April 29, 1972, page 2. with a major premiere in Chicago; however, it was soon withdrawn due to a lack of business.[tpl]cite book |title=Movies Made For Television: The Telefeature and the Mini-series, 1964-1986 |last=Marill |first=Alvin H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=Baseline/New York Zoetrope |location=New York |isbn=0-918432-85-5 |page= |pages=53–4 [/tpl] Critics have called the movie one of finest telefilms ever made.Harry Bowman. "Broadcast Beat column: 'Brian's Song' superior film," The Dallas Morning News, November 27, 1971, page 7A.
The movie is based on Sayers' account of his friendship with Piccolo and coping with Piccolo's illness in Sayers' autobiography, I Am Third. The film was written by veteran screenwriter William Blinn, whose script, one Dallas television critic called, "highly restrained, steering clear of any overt sentimentality conveying the genuine affection the two men felt so deeply for each other." 
Although based on a true story, the film did include some fictional scenes. One example was when George Halas (played by Jack Warden) told Gale Sayers that he wanted to bench Brian Piccolo when he suspected that there may be a problem affecting his performance. He later learned of Brian's cancer. In reality, Jim Dooley was the head coach at that time, as Halas had retired from the position following the 1967 season.

[[Jodel]]
CATEGORIES: Aircraft manufacturers of France

Société Avions Jodel is a French aircraft company started in 1946 by Édouard Joly and his son-in-law Jean Délémontez. Jodel designed a range of light aeroplanes shortly after the Second World War.  The popular myth is that the two, with no formal aerodynamics training, set about designing a single-seat aircraft with some spare plywood and a small Poinsard aircraft engine.  The result was the 1948 D9 Bébé (Baby) model.  In fact, the two had much experience of building and designing aircraft, Delemontez being a trained aeronautical engineer, and Joly having built an aircraft before the war.  
The French government bought many of the aircraft, with more than 500 D9s being built during the next twenty years.  Subsequently, the government expressed interest in a larger aircraft as a training aircraft and the two-seat D11 model followed in 1950.  
Jodel aircraft are all-wood, usually made from Sitka spruce and plywood made out of okoume (also known as gaboon), a kind of West African hardwood. Most of the designs are recognisable by their distinctive wings, which have ‘cranked’ dihedral only on the outer third. The wings also incorporate washout, retaining aileron effectiveness at or just prior to the stall. From above or below, the wings are also distinctive as this cranked section of the wing tapers sharply towards the wingtip.  
Apart from prototypes, Jodels were made by a variety of French aviation manufacturers, but all construction ceased during the 1960s.  Since that time, new Jodels have been made only as homebuilt aircraft by amateur builders.  The design is popular in France and, to a lesser extent, around Europe, but the type is virtually unknown outside Europe, especially in the Americas.  In Australia, the design has been brought up to date somewhat by Frank Rogers, who redrew the French designs to Australian civil aviation standards. The Jodel designs were later licensed to Avions Robin (in France), Aero Difusión in (Spain) and Falconar Avia (in Canada), which produced derivative designs that retained the Jodel wing.

Social comparison theory was initially proposed by social psychologist Leon Festinger in 1954.Festinger, L. (1954). A theory of social comparison processes. Human relations, 7(2), 117-140. Social comparison theory is centered on the belief that there is a drive within individuals to  gain accurate self-evaluations. The theory explains how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others in order to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn how to define the self.
Following the initial theory, research began to focus on social comparison as a way of self-enhancement,Gruder, C. L. (1971). Determinants of social comparison choices.

From small beginnings (a network of inventors, a quarterly newsletter), the Institute grew into a full-fledged organisation under his leadership: producing an annual compendium, running social inventions workshops and promoting creative solutions around the world. It was part of the first European Social Innovations Exchange. In 2001, the Institute was awarded a Margaret Mead Special Recognition Award for "community creativity for a new century"
In 1995, the Global Ideas Bank (originally suggested by an American correspondent, Gregory Wright) was first established online, and has since become the name for the entire project's work. Through the work of several volunteer programmers and technical wizards (especially Flemming Funch of the New Civilization Network), new features were added: online submission, voting systems, categorisation, a message board, and so on.

KTRK-TV. February 26, 2011. Retrieved on February 27, 2011.
Beltway 8, a state highway, runs mostly along the frontage roads of the tollway, only using the main lanes where they are free between Interstate Highway 45 (North Freeway) and Interstate Highway 69/U.S. 59 (Eastex Freeway). The main lanes elsewhere are the Sam Houston Tollway, a toll road owned and operated by the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA). East of Houston, the Tollway crosses the Houston Ship Channel on the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, a toll bridge; this forms a gap in Beltway 8 between Interstate Highway 10 (Baytown-East Freeway) and State Highway 225 (La Porte Freeway).
Beltway 8 is the intermediate beltway in the Houston area. The inner beltway - Interstate Highway 610 - lies mostly within Houston (except for an approximate two mile (3 km) stretch that runs through the City of Bellaire), and the outer beltway — State Highway 99 (Grand Parkway) — is not complete.

CATEGORIES: Non-profit organizations based in Canada

The Canadian Unity Council was a privately owned non-profit organization whose mission was the promotion of Canadian Unity and the current federal institutions.
The CUC started as the "Canada Committee" in 1964, in the middle of Quebec's Quiet Revolution. The period corresponds to the rise of both the Quebec independence movement and the demands for reform by Quebec federalists.
The election of the Parti Québécois in 1976 gave the impulse for a coalition strategy, which included all federalist parties. Funded by the Government of Canada, the CUC published numerous pro-Canada studies advertising the merits of Canadian federalism.
In 1996, the Centre for Research and Information on Canada (CRIC) was created to assist in the CUC's mission to promote the federal government's view of what federal Canada is.
In 2006, the Government of Stephen Harper announced the reduction of funding for the Unity Council.http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2007/05/29/bloc-reaction.html

[[Explosive ROF]]
CATEGORIES: Explosive ROF

An Explosive ROF was a UK Government-owned Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF), which specialised in manufacturing explosives during and after World War II. Note: In World War I, the name used in the UK for Government-owned explosives factories was National Explosives Factory; and the Cordite factory at Gretna was known as HM Factory, Gretna.
These Second World War factories were built for the Ministry of Supply with the Ministry of Works, in all cases except ROF Irvine, acting as agent. Explosive ROF's specialised in producing either high-explosives, such as TNT (trinitrotoluene) or RDX; or propellants, such as cordite, but there were minor exceptions to this demarcation. The products from these Explosive ROFs were shipped to Filling Factories for filling into munitions.
Pyrotechnics, such as fuzes and screening smokes, tended to be made at the Filling Factories and filled directly into munitions.

Asmus Jacob Carstens (or "Jakob", May 10, 1754 – May 25, 1798) was a Danish-German painter, one of the most committed artists of German Neoclassicism.  His career was erratic, partly because of his difficult personality, and the majority of his large projects were left incomplete, or subsequently destroyed. Much of what survives is in the form of drawings, many using "a schematic, pale colouring as a timid and humble accessory to the dominating figure-drawing", that were planned for large fresco commissions that never materialized.Novotny, 51-54, 52 quoted

[[Umklapp scattering]]

CATEGORIES: Scattering

Umklapp scattering (also U-process or Umklapp process) is the transformation, like a reflection or a translation, of a wave vector to another Brillouin zone as a result of a scattering process, for example an electron-lattice potential scattering or an anharmonic phonon-phonon (or electron-phonon) scattering process, reflecting an electronic state or creating a phonon with a momentum k-vector outside the first Brillouin zone. Umklapp scattering is one process limiting the thermal conductivity in crystalline materials, the others being phonon scattering on crystal defects and at the surface of the sample.
Figure 1 schematically shows the possible scattering processes of two incoming phonons with wave-vectors (k-vectors) k1 and k2 (red) creating one outgoing phonon with a wave vector k3 (blue). As long as the sum of k1 and k2 stay inside the first Brillouin zone (gray squares) k3 is the sum of the former two conserving phonon momentum. This process is called normal scattering (N-process).
With increasing phonon momentum and thus wave vector of k1 and k2 their sum might point outside the Brillouin zone (k3). As shown in Figure 2, k-vectors outside the first Brillouin zone are physically equivalent to vectors inside it and can be mathematically transformed into each other by the addition of a reciprocal lattice vector G.  These processes are called Umklapp scattering and change the total phonon momentum.
Umklapp scattering is the dominant process for thermal resistivity at high temperatures for low defect crystals. The thermal conductivity for an insulating crystal where the U-processes are dominant has 1/T dependence.
The name derives from the German word umklappen (to turn over). Rudolf Peierls, in his autobiography Bird of Passage states he was the originator of this phrase and  coined it during his 1929 crystal lattice studies under the tutelage of Wolfgang Pauli. Peierls wrote, "...I used the German term Umklapp (flip-over) and this rather ugly word has remained in use....[tpl]cite book |last= Peierls |first= Rudolf |year= 1985|title= Bird of Passage: Recollections of a Physicist|url= |location= |publisher= Princeton University Press|isbn= 0691083908|accessdate= 18 November 2013[/tpl]"

The term United States domestic market (USDM) is a term used chiefly by automotive enthusiasts to describe the United States' economic market for American-brand automobiles and parts. A similar automotive enthusiast term, Japan Domestic Market (JDM) is used to designate Japanese-market automobiles and parts.
The term is also applied to vehicles that comply with United States regulations, most notably the lights and bumpers, which differ from European standards. The incompatibility requires manufacturers to develop USD and EDM versions of their models if they want to sell them in both regions.
Sometimes the conversion in the factory lane is done after the model was launched in the original market. The conversion to United States federal laws is often called "federalization".

Palmer Theological Seminary is a Baptist seminary founded in 1925 as Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Originally located on Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, it moved in 1940 to Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, just across the street from the city boundary. In 2012, the school sold this location and moved temporarily to the American Baptist Churches offices located at 588 N. Gulph Road, King of Prussia, PA. The seminary intends to move on to the campus of its parent institution, Eastern University, once new building projects are completed. Over the years, the seminary has been best known for combining evangelical theology with the affirmation of women in ministry and commitment to social justice and ethnic diversity. From the beginning, the Seminary welcomed female students. The Seminary's values are captured by its founding motto, "The Whole Gospel for the Whole World."
At its inception, the seminary established a collegiate division in order to serve those who lacked the academic preparation for seminary-level courses. This evolved into Eastern Baptist College, founded in 1952. What was once Eastern Baptist College is now Eastern University. In 2004, Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary re-merged with Eastern University. The following year, the seminary changed its name to Palmer Theological Seminary in honor of its longest serving president (1936-48), Gordon Palmer.
Affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA, Palmer Seminary is multidenominational. United Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, African Methodist Episcopalians, and other Protestant church denominations are represented both on the Palmer faculty and in its student body.

New West Electronic Arts & Music Organization (NWEAMO), founded by composer Joseph Waters in Portland, Oregon, U.S. in 1998, is a nonprofit organization based in San Diego, California that produces the annual international festival of electro-acoustic music.
NWEAMO is dedicated to forging connections between the composers, performers and lovers of avant garde classical music with the DJ’s, MC’s, guitar-gods, troubadours and gourmets of experimental popular music. The organization promotes music that involves the creative use of computers and electronics mixed with acoustics. Today, NWEAMO has showcased artists in prime venues across the world.
In a healthy cultural milieu NWEAMO celebrates both classical and popular music. The idea behind this seemingly controversial connection is that without any connection, both genres suffer. When classical music does not connect with popular culture, it becomes a music of experts, unable to reflect and contribute meaningfully in the broad marketplace of developing ideas and cultural experimentation. Popular music on the other hand, becomes naïve and superficial, untethered to its historical roots and broad cultural underpinnings, without connection and communication with classical music. NWEAMO attempts to generate a synthesis that reveals new possibilities for both.

Andrew Cant (1590–1663) was a Presbyterian minister and leader of the Scottish Covenanters. About 1623 the people of Edinburgh called him to be their minister, but he was rejected by James I. Ten years later he was minister of Pitsligo in Aberdeenshire, a charge which he left in 1638 for that of Newbattle in Midlothian. In July of that year he went with other commissioners to Aberdeen in the vain attempt to induce the university and the presbytery of that city to subscribe the National Covenant, and in the following November sat in the general assembly at Glasgow which abolished episcopacy in Scotland. In 1640 he was chaplain to the Scottish army and then settled as minister at Aberdeen. Though a stanch Covenanter, he was a zealous Royalist, preaching before Charles I in Edinburgh, and stoutly advocating the restoration of the monarchy in the time of the Commonwealth. Cant's frequent and bitter attacks on various members of his congregation led in 1661 to complaints laid before the magistrates, in consequence of which he resigned his charge. His son Andrew was principal of Edinburgh University (1675 - 1685).

Selenography is the study of the surface and physical features of the Moon. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar maria, craters, mountain ranges, and other various features. This task was largely finished when high resolution images of the near and far sides of the Moon were obtained by orbiting spacecraft during the early space era. Nevertheless, some regions of the Moon remain poorly imaged (especially near the poles) and the exact locations of many features (like crater depths) are uncertain by several kilometers. Today, selenography is considered to be a subdiscipline of selenology, which itself is most often referred to as just "lunar science." The word selenography is derived from the Greek lunar deity Selene and γράφω (graphō, “I write”).

[[Churchmanship]]
CATEGORIES: Church of England churchmanship, Anglican Churchmanship, Christian terms

Churchmanship (or tradition in most official contexts) is a way of talking about and labelling different tendencies, parties, or schools of thought within the Church of England and the sister churches of the Anglican Communion. 
The term is derived from the older noun churchman, which originally meant an ecclesiastic or clergyman but sometime before 1677 was extended to people who were strong supporters of the Church of England, and was by the 19th century used to distinguish between Anglicans and Dissenters. The word "churchmanship" itself was first used in 1680 to refer to the attitude of these supporters but later acquired its modern meaning. While many Anglicans are content to label their own churchmanship, not all Anglicans would feel happy to be described as anything but "Anglican" [tpl]harvcol|Neill||p=398[/tpl]. In official contexts the term gender-neutral term "tradition" is preferred.[tpl]by whom|date=May 2013[/tpl]
"High" and "Low", the oldest labels, date from the late 17th century and originally described opposing political attitudes to the relation between the Church of England and the civil power. Their meaning shifted as historical settings changed and towards the end of the 19th century they were being used to describe different views on the ceremonies to be used in worship. Shortly after the introduction of the "High/Low" distinction, a section of the "Low" Church was nicknamed Latitudinarian because of its relative indifference to doctrinal definition. In the 19th century, this group gave birth to the Broad Church which in its turn produced the "Modernist" movement of the first half of the 20th century. Today, the "parties" are usually thought of as Anglo-Catholics, Evangelicals, and Liberals; and, with the exception of "High Church", the remaining terms are mainly used to refer to past history. The precise shades of meaning of any term vary from user to user and mixed descriptions such as liberal-catholic are found. Today "Broad Church" may be used today with a different sense to the historical one mentioned above and used to identify Anglicans who are neither markedly high, nor low/evangelical nor liberal [tpl]harvcol|Hylson-Smith||p=340[/tpl].
It is an Anglican commonplace to say that authority in the church has three sources: the Scriptures, Reason, and Tradition. In general, the Low churchman and Evangelical tend to put more emphasis on Scripture; the Broad churchman and Liberal, on reason; and the High churchman and Anglo-catholic, on tradition ([tpl]Harvcolnb|Holmes III||p=11[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvcolnb|Carey||p=14-16[/tpl]). The emphasis on "parties" and differences is necessary but in itself gives an incomplete picture. Cyril Garbett (later Archbishop of York) wrote of his coming to the Diocese of Southwark:
[tpl]blockquote|I found the different parties strongly represented with their own organizations and federations... But where there was true reverence and devotion I never felt any difficulty in worshipping and preaching in an Anglo-Catholic church in the morning and in an Evangelical church in the evening"... and when there was a call for united action... the clergy and laity without distinction of party were ready to join in prayer, work and sacrifice.|[tpl]harvcol|Garbett||p=27[/tpl][/tpl]
and William Gibson commented that
[tpl]blockquote|the historical attention given to the fleeting moments of controversy in the eighteenth century has masked the widespread and profound commitment to peace and tranquility among both the clergy and the laity.... High Church and Low Church were not exclusive categories of though and churchmanship. They were blurred and broad streams within Anglicanism that often merged, overlapped and coincided.|[tpl]harvcol|Gibson||p=1, 2[/tpl][/tpl]
Sometimes the concept of churchmanship has been extended to other denominations. In Lutheran churches it can be liberal Protestant, pietist, confessional Lutheran, or evangelical Catholic.

Kozyrev is an impact crater on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the south-southeast of the crater Carver, and to the southwest of the Roche–Pauli crater pair.
This is an eroded crater formation, although most of the outer rim remains well-defined. There is a small, slightly skewed crater laid across the north-northwestern rim. Attached to the southeast of this feature in the northern part of Kozyrev's interior floor is a smaller, bowl-shaped crater. The remainder of the interior is marked only by tiny craterlets. The inner wall is slightly wider along the eastern side than elsewhere.

[[Torsten Stålhandske]]

CATEGORIES: 1593 births, 1644 deaths, People from Porvoo, Finnish generals, Swedish generals

Torsten Stålhandske (Porvoo, Finland, 1 September 1593 – Haderslev, 21 April 1644) – Swedish for "Torsten Steelglove",  sometimes written "Stålhansch" in the Swedish of the times http://www.ra.se/KRA/0425.html#1628, and referred to in German literature  as Torsten Staalhansch,  was a Finnish officer in the Swedish army during the Thirty Years' War.
The son of Torsten Svensson (Stålhandske), a noble military officer of Swedish ancestry from Western Götaland, and Carin Lydiksdotter Jägerhorn, of Finnish nobility from southern Finland, Torsten Stålhandske married Kristina Horn in 1643. Albeit a short man, he was exceptionally strong;  when a captured enemy officer, particularly a Pole or an Austrian was led into the Swedish camp, he would shake their hands so hard that blood would appear under their fingernails in what he called "an honest Swedish handshake".  Hence, his nickname.
Stålhandske started his military career as a squire to Patrick Ruthwen, with whom he had a task of recruiting military in Scotland.  He followed Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to Prussia, as an Ensign in his Personal guard in 1626. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of Major in the Regiment of Arvid Horn. In 1627 he joined the cavalry led by Åke Henriksson Tott.
In 1629 he was promoted to Lieutenant-colonel in the Nylands och Tavastehus Cavalry regiment, leading Finnish horsemen, also known as Hakkapeliitat, for the first time into the Thirty Years' War. At the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) they rode with the right wing personally led by King  Gustavus Adolphus. In 1632 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel.  At  the siege of Nuremberg he assaulted the "invincible warriors"  of Austrian Colonel Cronberg and, thanks to his mighty and successful charges, largely determined the outcome of the Battle of Lützen, where Gustavus Adolphus was killed, the battle was nonetheless won.
In June 1634, Stålhandske was wounded at the Battle of Hamelin. In 1635, a Major-general, he joined the main army led by Banér. At the Battle of Wittstock he personally captured 35 flags and, at a critical juncture of the battle, forced the enemy to flee. Similarly, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Chemnitz as well as in Silesia,  where he defended his positions during the whole year of 1640 against Count Mansfeld.
Finally, in April 1642,  he joined his forces with Torstenson's Army and took part in the Second Battle of Breitenfeld (also known as the First Battle of Leipzig), where he was seriously wounded. In May he was appointed general in Chief of the Cavalry. In 1643 Stålhandske followed Torstenson in  Bohemia. In 1644 he crushed a hostile army corps in the Jutland, but then fell ill and died in Haderslev on 21 April 1644.
Torsten Stålhandske's mausoleum can be seen in the Cathedral of Turku (Finland).

This crater has been worn by impact erosion, leaving the features rounded and somewhat irregular. But the perimeter of the rim can still be traced in the rugged surrounding terrain. There is a small, fresh crater laid across the eastern rim, and some old and worn depression along the southern and western inner wall. On the whole, there is little to distinguish this crater from the multitude of other impacts in this region.
It lies inside the Korolev Crater, and is 30 miles (50km) across.[tpl]cite book|author1=Heather Couper|author2=Nigel Henbest|title=Encyclopedia of Space|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xGraFRhwutUC&pg=PA297|date=30 January 2009|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-0-7566-5600-3|pages=297–[/tpl]

[[John Habberton]]
CATEGORIES: 1842 births, 1921 deaths, 19th-century American novelists, American male novelists, Pseudonymous writers

John Habberton (1842 – 1921) was an American author.  He spent nearly twenty years as the literary and drama critic for the New York Herald, but he is best known for his stories about early California life, many of which were collected in his 1880 book Romance of California Life: Illustrated by Pacific Slope Stories, Thrilling, Pathetic and Humorous (New York: Baker, Pratt & Co., 1880).
Habberton also wrote Helen's Babies, published in 1876 by Loring Publisher, Boston; and in the early 20th Century by George Routledge and Sons, London. In most of these copies, Habberton is not listed as the author. The novel is subtitled: "Helen's Babies with some account of their ways...innocent, crafty, angelic, impish, witching and repulsive by THEIR LATEST VICTIM."  The book was one of the Ruby Books series for boys and girls.  Habberton is acknowledged as the author of the book in an advertisement within the 1903 edition of Andersen's Fairy Tales published by Routledge.
Habberton is acknowledged, also, in an inexpensive cardboard-back edition of "Helen's Babies" published by (and copyrighted by!) Whitman Publishing Company of Racine, Wisconsin in 1934. That edition is copiously illustrated by Pauline Adams.
"Helen's Babies" was intended as just a piece of humour and aimed at an adult audience. But the hilarious novel almost instantly became a major juvenile literature success, highly estimated by the youngsters as well as authorities like Rudyard Kipling. It became a classic ranking on par with "Tom Sawyer", "Wind in the Willows", "Winnie-the Pooh" and the like. Popularity dwindled a bit after WW-II (although George Orwell mentions it very favourably in his 1946 essay on early American literature, "Riding Down from Bangor"), but started rising again in the 1980s. Translated into numerous foreign languages, it secured Habberton's modest share of immortality in literature.
Curiously, as being one of the first pieces of an author, so insecure about his abilities, that he omitted his author name resp. wrote under pseudonym for many years.
Habberton was also known under the pseudonym "Smelfungus." (Source: Initials and Pseudonyms: A Dictionary of Literary Disguises by Cushing, William).

[[Todpool]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in Cornwall

Todpool is a hamlet in south-west Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is located between Chacewater and St Day villages and is three miles (5 km) east of Redruth.
During the 19th century, Todpool was an important site for tin mining due to its proximity to Poldice mine. Today, disused mineshafts and derelict engine houses are scattered throughout the area.  Todpool was once busy enough to support a pub (now a private house) and a church, but is now a quiet backwater of miners' cottages.
The road that runs through Todpool is Bownder An Sycamor, which translates from Cornish as Lane of the Sycamore.

Zelig Hirsch Kalmanovich ([tpl]lang-lv|Zēligs Hiršs Kalmanovičs[/tpl]) (1885–1944) was a Litvak Jewish philologist, translator, historian, and community archivist of the early 20th century. He was a renowned scholar of Yiddish. In 1929 he settled in Vilnius where he became an early director of YIVO.
He was incarcerated in the Vilna Ghetto where he became an observant Jew. During his time in the ghetto, Kalmanovich kept a secret diary which is one of the few primary sources recording day-to-day life. His diary stressed the efforts of the community to retain their humanity in the face of oppression. For example, on October 11, 1942, he wrote the following entry in his diary:  On Simhat Torah eve at the invitation of the rabbi, I went for services in a house that had formerly been a synagogue and was now a music school ... I said a few words: 'Our song and dance are a form of worship. Our rejoicing is due to Him who decrees life and death. Here in the midst of this small congregation, in the poor and ruined synagogue, we are united with the whole house of Israel, not only with those who are here today ... And you in your rejoicing, atone for the sins of a generation that is perishing. I know that the Jewish people will live ... And every day the Holy One, blessed be He, in His mercy gives us a gift which we accept with joy and give thanks to His holy name. 
During the Nazi occupation, he was forced to work at the YIVO offices under Nazi supervision, sorting through the pillaged contents of Vilna's libraries and preparing selected volumes for shipment to Germany. He was sent to the Vaivara concentration camp in Estonia, where he died in 1944.

[[Church architecture]]
CATEGORIES: Religious architecture, Architectural styles, Church architecture

Church architecture refers to the architecture of buildings of Christian churches. It has evolved over the two thousand years of the Christian religion, partly by innovation and partly by imitating other architectural styles as well as responding to changing beliefs, practices and local traditions. From the birth of Christianity to the present, the most significant objects of transformation for Christian architecture and design were the great churches of Byzantium, the Romanesque abbey churches, Gothic cathedrals and Renaissance basilicas with its emphasis on harmony. These large, often ornate and architecturally prestigious buildings were dominant features of the towns and countryside in which they stood. But far more numerous were the parish churches scattered across the Christian world, the focus of Christian devotion in every town and village. While a few are counted as sublime works of architecture to equal the great cathedrals, the majority developed along simpler lines, showing great regional diversity and often demonstrating local vernacular technology and decoration.  
Buildings were at first adapted from those originally intended for other purposes but, with the rise of distinctively ecclesiastical architecture, church buildings came to influence secular ones which have often imitated religious architecture. In the 20th century, the use of new materials, such as steel and concrete, has had an effect upon the design of churches. The history of church architecture divides itself into periods, and into countries or regions and by religious affiliation. The matter is complicated by the fact that buildings put up for one purpose may have been re-used for another, that new building techniques may permit changes in style and size, that changes in liturgical practice may result in the alteration of existing buildings and that a building built by one religious group may be used by a successor group with different purposes.

The Byrds is a four-CD box set by the American rock band The Byrds that was released on October 19, 1990 by Columbia/Legacy.[tpl]cite web|title=The Byrds Box Set review|publisher=Allmusic|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r3076|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|page=549|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X[/tpl]  The compilation comprises 90 tracks and covers the band's career from 1965 to 1971 (a period when they were signed to Columbia Records) in roughly chronological order, but excludes material from their 1973 reunion album Byrds, which was released on Asylum Records.[tpl]cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|pages=439–442|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X[/tpl][tpl]cite AV media notes|title=The Byrds Box Set|others=The Byrds|year=1990|first=Bob|last=Irwin|pages=3–10|type=CD booklet|publisher=Columbia/Legacy[/tpl]  The box set also includes six songs performed by a reunited line-up of The Byrds, featuring original members Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman.  Of these six songs, two were recorded live at the Roy Orbison Tribute Concert on February 24, 1990 and four are new studio recordings dating from August 1990.  The two other original members of The Byrds, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke, who were both still living in 1990, did not participate in the reunion.
At the time of its release, The Byrds was the first box set by a defunct rock act to be issued by Columbia Records.  The compilation includes a number of rare and previously unreleased songs, many of which were later included as bonus tracks on the remastered editions of the band's individual albums.[tpl]cite web|title=The Byrds Boxed Set|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/lpbox.html|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl]  Of special interest to fans of both The Byrds and country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, was the inclusion of six previously unreleased tracks from the recording sessions of The Byrds' 1968 album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo.  Of these unreleased tracks, the versions of "The Christian Life", "You Don't Miss Your Water", and "One Hundred Years from Now" featured their original Parsons' lead vocals, which had been removed and replaced by McGuinn and Hillman prior to the release of the album.[tpl]cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher|page=176|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0[/tpl]  In the years since Sweetheart of the Rodeo was issued, these "lost" Parsons' vocals had become near-legendary among fans of the band and their inclusion on The Byrds provided a major selling point for the box set.  
The Byrds' lead guitarist Roger McGuinn served as "musical consultant" during preparation of the set and also had a hand in deciding the final track listing.  While The Byrds does provide a detailed overview of the band's music, there has been some criticism concerning the absence of songs written by Gene Clark, who was the band's principal songwriter in its early years.[tpl]cite book|author=Einarson, John.|pages=294–295|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5[/tpl]  In particular, the exclusion of popular and highly regarded Clark-penned songs such as "Set You Free This Time" and "Here Without You" was interpreted by many fans as an attempt on McGuinn's part to downplay Clark's importance in the group.  The additional failure of McGuinn to mention Clark in the box set's booklet, while at the same time praising Crosby and Hillman, served to reinforce the notion that Clark was being intentionally slighted.    
Upon release, the box set reached #151 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart in the U.S., during a chart stay of four weeks, but failed to reach the UK Albums Chart.[tpl]cite book|author=Whitburn, Joel.|page=122|year=2002|title=Top Pop Albums 1955–2001|publisher=Hal Leonard Corp|isbn=0-634-03948-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Brown, Tony|page=130|year=2000|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-7670-8[/tpl]  A single disc selection from the box set, titled 20 Essential Tracks from the Boxed Set: 1965–1990, was also released in January 1992.[tpl]cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|pages=553–554|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X[/tpl]  The first 16 tracks on this single disc collection date from The Byrds' 1965 to 1971 period, while the final 4 tracks are from the 1990 reunion.[tpl]cite web|title=20 Essential Tracks from the Boxed Set: 1965–1990 review|publisher=Allmusic|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r3077|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl]

Robert Foulis (May 5, 1796 – January 28, 1866) was a Canadian inventor, civil engineer and artist. Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Foulis moved to Canada in 1818, following the death of his first wife in childbirth.
He settled in Saint John, New Brunswick where he was appointed deputy land surveyor in 1822. After he surveyed the upper Saint John River for the feasibility of steamshipping, he became involved with the buildings of several early steamboats and the first Saint John harbour ferry.
Foulis founded the province's first iron foundry in 1825 and a school of arts in 1838. Later, he patented a gas light apparatus that was later used in lighthouses and, thanks to his daughter, invented a steam-powered foghorn whose paternity was disputed between himself and the government of New Brunswick. It was while he was walking home on a foggy night and his daughter was playing her piano. He couldn't hear any of the notes except for very low ones. He thought that could fix all the problems that are causing ships to crash in the fog.
Due to business ventures of varying success and his failure at patenting his foghorn, Foulis died in poverty.

The album marks a turn in the band's sound, featuring a stark, almost frigid aesthetic, bearing similarities to the sound of the Young Marble Giants, an early 1980s British minimalist post-punk band. 
The eleventh track was named "Minus 3" due to the third loss of a member from the band.

[[Portuguese in Africa]]
CATEGORIES: Portuguese dialects

Portuguese in the African continent is spoken in a number of African states and is the official language in five of these. These states are: Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe These are Portuguese-speaking communities in most countries of Southern Africa, a mixture of Portuguese settlers and Angolans and Mozambicans who left their contries during the civil wars. A rough estimate has it that there are about 14 million Portuguese speakers across Africa,[tpl]cite web|title=The Future of Portuguese|url=http://www.bbportuguese.com/the-future-of-portuguese.html|publisher=BB Portuguese|accessdate=11 April 2012[/tpl] but depending on the criteria applied, the number might even be considerably higher.   Like French and English, Portuguese has become a post-colonial language in Africa and one of the working languages of the African Union (AU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Portuguese co-exists in Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe with Portuguese-based creoles (Upper Guinea and Gulf of Guinea Creoles), and in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau  with autochthonous African languages (mainly Niger–Congo family).
In Africa, Portuguese experiences pressure and possibly competition from French and English. Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe are all members of La Francophonie and Mozambique is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and has observer status at La Francophonie. Conversely, Equatorial Guinea has announced its decision to introduce Portuguese as its third official language, in addition to Spanish and French, and has made a request for membership in the CPLP. Mauritius and Senegal have also joined the CPLP as associate observer members.

Jim Bohlen (July 4, 1926 – July 5, 2010) was an American engineer who worked on the Atlas ICBM missile program, later emigrated to Canada after becoming disillusioned with the US government's nuclear policy during the Cold War. He became one of the founders of Greenpeace.http://news.discovery.com/earth/farewell-rainbow-warrior.html
Bohlen, one of the approximately half-dozen founders of Greenpeace,  arguably made the most lasting impression with his brilliant backroom dealings. He effectively out-manoeuvered  more high profile members of the group such as Paul Watson within the organization's inner workings and can be primarily credited with transforming the organization from a small, vociferous Canadian pressure group into the highly efficient international movement it is today. Although a British Columbian himself, Bohlen was a strong supporter of the creation of Greenpeace International and the move of the group's headquarters from Vancouver to New York, essentially giving birth to Greenpeace as we know it today. He was also instrumental in developing the group's hierarchical military-style command structure. 
He made a similar and even less-acknowledged contribution to Green politics in Canada by negotiating a deal that ended the party's 10-year prohibition against Green Parties having leaders at a meeting of the Green Party of BC in 1992. (Between 1982 and 1992, some Green Parties were required by law to have registered leaders but party constitutions prohibited these individuals from speaking for these parties.) Within four years of Bohlen's breakthrough agreement, all Canadian Green parties had moved to adopt conventional political structures in which their leaders functioned as primary spokespeople.
Bohlen ran for the Greens federally in 1988. Some credit friction between him and long-time enemy Paul Watson for Watson's defection to the NDP during that campaign.

[[The Entrancing Flame]]
CATEGORIES: 1996 books

The Entrancing Flame 1996 is a book by John E Heymer, which gets its title from one deductive conclusion that he has reached from examining many cases of alleged spontaneous human combustion (SHC). 
While there is natural uncertainty over whether all these criteria fit all alleged victims of SHC, the circumstances are broadly supported by circumstantial evidence in the best cases for the SHC hypothesis.
Victims such as Saffin (1982) and Gowthorpe (1991) are known to fit the above descriptions, although it must be said that Saffin did not speak between her combustion and eventual death meaning that amnesia cannot be proven.
Heymer therefore concludes that SHC victims fall into a form of trance before catching fire. He does not reach any conclusion about why this might be.
Heymer also notes that all of the victims have one thing in common: aloneness and probably loneliness. 
He points out that mentally handicapped Jeannie Saffin may have burned to death in front of loving relatives, but observes that she had been devoted to her mother.
Her mother (in her 90s) had died a year before Jeannie herself caught fire. Heymer observes that Jeannie had mourned and pined constantly since her mother died, and that she could not understand where her mother had gone (Jeannie, in common with many six-year-old minds, had no concept of death). 
She had had the one constant presence in her life inexplicably removed and was under great emotional stress as a result. Heymer says that Jeannie Saffin may well have been the loneliest victim of all.
As for the putative mechanism behind SHC, Heymer speculates that defective mitochondria in the body are to blame, breaking down and allowing free hydrogen to build up within the cell. 
The potential for such accident certainly exists, when hydrogen is generated (and normally bound) during the Krebs Cycle. However, it is not a known malfunction of the Krebs cycle to produce free hydrogen.
Heymer then supposes that a small pocket of hydrogen is detonated by the 0.225 volt of electricity generated across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. 
Heymer claims that the human body, through mitochondria, carries 45,000 volts per cubic centimetre and that the process of a single cell erupting sets off neighbouring cells in a chain reaction that destroys the body until biological action ceases.
In support of his hypothesis, Heymer points out that it is typically the lower extremities (the legs, below the knee) and skulls of alleged SHC victims that survive combustion. 
This, he says, indicates that SHC typically begins in the region of abdomen and burns very rapidly outwards (the skull, he suggests, often falls down into the body during combustion, and is therefore destroyed outright).
Heymer suggests that by the time the process has consumed the heart and lungs, all circulation ceases and the fire comes to an abrupt halt just seconds after commencing—hence the reported blue flames, the sharp edges of burns to clothing, and the failure to ignite surroundings.
Heymer also thinks that a psychosomatic process in emotionally-distressed people can trigger off his supposed mitochondrial explosion.

Margaret L. Bridgman (January 10, 1940 – January 4, 2009) was a Canadian politician. Bridgman was a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 1997, representing the Canadian, federal electoral district of Surrey North in Surrey, British Columbia.
Born in Kimberley, British Columbia, she was elected to Parliament for Surrey North in the 1993 election as a candidate of the Reform Party of Canada.
In 2001, Bridgman unsuccessfully ran for the Reform Party of British Columbia in the riding of Surrey-Newton.
Before entering politics, Brigdman was a police constable, a nurse, and a nurse administrator."Federal Experience," Parliament of Canada biography.
As a young woman, Bridgman lived and worked in London as a police constable (traffic bobby). Subsequently, she trained in London as a psychiatric nurse, becoming a Registered Nurse (RN) and a Psychiatric Nurse (PN) before returning to Canada. Bridgman went on to earn the Director of Nursing designation from the University of Saskatchewan, rising to become a nurse administrator.
In September 1993, the designated Reform Party candidate for Surrey North resigned his nomination. Bridgman was President of the Surrey North Reform Party Constituency Association, and she was selected to run as the Reform Party candidate. On October 25, 1993, Margaret Bridgman was elected the Member of Parliament for Surrey North, unseating the incumbent with a plurality of 6413 votes."of Federal Ridings since 1867," Parliament of Canada. Prior to Bridgman's landmark victory, Surrey North and its predecessor ridings had been held either by the New Democratic Party or the Progressive Conservative Party since 1958.
Bridgman served as the Reform Party Critic on Health and Assistant Critic on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. She sat as the Reform Party member of the House of Commons Standing Committees on Health and on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, during the 35th Parliament. In her maiden speech in the House of Commons, Bridgman focused on the need for more effective and cost-conscious funding of health care in Canada."Maiden Speech, Margaret L. Bridgman, M.P., House of Commons Debates No. 13, 35th Parl., 1st Sess. (2 Feb 94). Bridgman's interventions in the House of Commons ranged from remarks on health care and Indian Affairs to young offenders, old age security, and the spending priorities of the Canadian parliament.""Bridgman, Margaret," Hansard Index, 35th Parl..
In 1997, Bridgman was successfully challenged for the Reform Party nomination by Chuck Cadman. Bridgman opted not to run as an independent in the 1997 general election, and she did not run, again, in a federal, electoral race.
Following the 1997 election, Bridgman returned to nursing in Surrey, British Columbia. After a sustained battle with lung cancer, Margaret Bridgman died at home on January 4, 2009.

[[Italian Unabomber]]

CATEGORIES: Terrorism in Italy

The Italian Unabomber ([tpl]lang-it|Unabomber[/tpl]) is a name given by the international media to an unknown terrorist tied to a series of booby-trap bombings in northern Italy, specifically in the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions, which began in 1994. Italian law enforcement officials and the FBI believed that Unabomber is Elvo Zornitta, a 49-year-old engineer who has been charged with the planting of 20 of the bombs after police raided his home in August 2006. Though it is possible a group is behind the attacks, the prevailing assumption of the investigation and media reports is that one man is behind the crimes. Dubbed the Unabomber by the Italian media and correspondingly called the Italian Unabomber by the international press, the bomber is named after the American convicted murderer Theodore Kaczynski, referred to as the "Unabomber" during his criminal career. Kaczynski planted miniature bombs in mail packages sent to selected targets that killed three people and injured 23. Similar to Kaczynski, the Italian Unabomber hides bombs in everyday items, though never targeting anyone in particular.  Instead, his bombs are set off by whoever happens to handle the booby-trapped object, including pens, candy containers and food jars. These objects are generally then placed in public places to await activation and are designed not to kill, but only to seriously injure a single person at short distance. Many of these devices are meant for small children using chocolate eggs, coloring markers, and bubble blowing tubes. Generally, the explosions severely injure limbs, hands, arms, faces and most of all eyes. Unlike Kaczynski, the attacker has made no political or economic demands. Several of his devices seem to have been planted in the "Continente" supermarket in the city of Portogruaro.
On August 28, 2006 Italian police raided the house of Elvo Zornitta, a 49-year-old engineer who has been under surveillance for a year. Police have suspected Zornitta for two years but had no proof until investigators raided his house and found a pair of scissors that forensic experts have linked to a bomb that failed to go off in 2004, with the blades that match the cut of a piece of tape used to fix one of the bombs. Booby-traps have been left in household items such as egg boxes, toothpaste and toys. "There is no such thing as the perfect crime and not even the Unabomber can get away with it cleanly", said Col Luciano Garofano, of the Carabinieri military police. Elvio Zornitta faced trial on October 10, 2006 where the experts designated by the judges in charge of investigations into the crimes committed by the mysterious 'Unabomber' and those appointed by that main suspect Elvo Zornitta will be heard in Trieste and evidence will be examined. One of the two experts designated by Trieste's anti-mafia judge Enzo Truncellit, was an FBI detective, Carlo J. Rosato, who came directly from the United States. The second expert was Pietro Benedetti from Brescia.
In January 2009, after years of investigations, Elvo Zornitta, the case was dropped after the prosecutors asked for its dismissal, for lack of evidence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
The evidence had been tampered with by the police.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] Elvo Zornitta received €2,500,000  as compensation for his arrest and trial which were based on false evidence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs) was the collective name of the UK government's munitions factories in and after World War II. Until privatisation in 1987 they were the responsibility of the Ministry of Supply and later the Ministry of Defence.
The majority of the ROFs were built in the re-armament period just before the start of the 1939-45 World War to enhance the capacity of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, the Royal Gunpowder Factory (RGPF) Waltham Abbey, Essex and the Royal Small Arms Factory, (RSAF) Enfield. These were sited in or near to London and were considered to be vulnerable to aerial bombing from continental Europe.
The Royal Arsenal designed many of the ROFs and was also the agent for the construction of all of the Rifles ROFs, the Medium Machine ROF and the Small Arms Ammunition ROFs. The Ministry of Supply, the Ministry of Works and two other private companies were agents for the construction of the remaining ROFs.Kohan (1952).

[[Pinega River]]
CATEGORIES: Rivers of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Northern Dvina basin

The Pinega ([tpl]lang-ru|Пинега[/tpl]) is a river in Verkhnetoyemsky, Pinezhsky, and Kholmogorsky Districts of Arkhangelsk Oblast in Russia. It is a right tributary of the Northern Dvina River. It is [tpl]convert|779|km|mi[/tpl] long, and the area of its basin [tpl]convert|42600|km2|sqmi[/tpl]. Its main tributaries are the Ilesha, the Vyya, the Yula, the Pokshenga, and the Yezhuga.
The Pinega is the main waterway of the Pinezhsky District, with many of the settlements in the district located on the river banks. The river basin includes the north-western part of the Krasnoborsky District, the eastern part of the Verkhnetoyemsky District, the eastern part of the Vinogradovsky District, the major part of the Pinezhsky District, the eastern part of the Kholmogorsky District, and minor areas in the Leshukonsky District and in the Udorsky District of the Komi Republic. The Pinega flows in the hilly landscape, on the western border of the Timan Ridge, in the coniferous forest (taiga). It freezes up in mid October - early November and stays under the ice until mid April - early May. 
The etymology of the name Pinega is unclear.[tpl]cite book|last=Фасмер|first=Макс|title=Этимологический словарь Фасмера|url=http://fasmerbook.com/p506.htm|language=Russian|page=506[/tpl]
The Pinega starts in Verkhnetoyemsky District, close to the border with Krasnoborsky District, at the confluence of the Belaya River and the Chyornaya River. There it flows to the north-west, then turns north. The first village on the Pinega is Belorechensky, still in Verkhnetoyemsky District. North of Belorechensky, the river meanders, and after accepting the Okhtoma River from the left, turns east. From this point downstream, the valley of the Pinega is populated, and the villages are grouped by several into mini-agglomerations. The Pinega accepts the Ilesha from the south and turns north again, emerging as a broad river with high banks. Further downstream it accepts the Vyya from the west, in the village of Ust-Vyyskaya, and after accepting the Nyukhcha from the right, in the village of Zanyukhcha, turns north-west. From this point on, the unpaved road appears from the Komi Republik, and follows the right bank of the river. Downstream from Zanyukhcha, the Pinega passes historical selos of Sura and Verkola, accepts the Yula from the west, and passes the selo of Kevrola, which was the historical center of the area before 19th century, on the left bank, and the selo of Karpogory, which is the current administrative center of the Pinezhsky District, on the right bank. Several kilometers downstream from Karpogory, the Pinega accepts the Pokshenga and turns north. In the village of Shilega, there is a railway bridge on the railroad connecting Arkhangelsk and Karpogory.
Downstream from the mouth of the Yezhuga the Pinega suddenly turns west, and in the settlement of Pinega, which served as the administrative center of the area, turns south-west. On the right-hand bank Pinezhsky Nature Reserve has been established. Further downstream, the Pinega crosses into the Kholmogorsky District. Its mouth is in the historical settlement of Ust-Pinega. 
The river is navigable within 580 km from its mouth, downstream from the village of Gorka, however, there is no passenger navigation. At one point, several kilometers upstream from the settlement of Pinega, the river comes within a distance of several kilometers to the course of the Kuloy. In this place, the Kuloy-Pinega Canal was constructed in 1926—1928, however, currently the canal is pretty much neglected.

Séverine (born Josiane Grizeau, 10 October 1948, Paris) is a female French singer.
Séverine won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1971 for Monaco, performing "Un banc, un arbre, une rue" (A bench, a tree, a street), with music by Jean-Pierre Bourtayre and words by Yves Dessca. It was also recorded in English as "Chance In Time", in German as "Mach die Augen zu (und wünsch dir einen Traum)" and Italian as "Il posto". The original French version made #9 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1971, whereas the English version, released on CBS rather than Philips, did not chart. The song charted highly in most other European markets. Séverine had further success in France and Germany, but never again on an international scale.
Séverine made two further attempts at winning the Eurovision Song Contest, participating in the German national finals of 1975 and 1982. Neither song won. She accompanied Monaco's delegation to the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens, Greece.

[[Assuwa league]]

CATEGORIES: Assuwa league

The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the Hittites under an earlier Tudhaliya I around 1400 BC. The league formed to oppose the Hittite empire. The list of its members contains 22 names, including ...uqqa, Warsiya, Taruisa, Wilusiya and Karkija (Caria).
Some of the identifications of these names are disputed. Wilusiya is commonly identified with Ilion (Troy), and Taruisa with the surrounding Troad, and Warsiya may be associated with Lukka (Lycia). However, identification of ..uqqa with later-attested Lukka (Lycia) is problematic, because that would put the Assuwa league both north and south of Arzawa in southwestern Anatolia. Assuwa appears to lie north of Arzawa, covering the northwestern corner of Anatolia. Homer in the Iliad seems to refer to two Lycias; in 2.876-77, 5.479 Sarpedon is a leader of "distant Lycia" while in 2.824ff. 5.105 Pandarus is another leader of Lycians from around Mount Ida near Troy, so that Lukka vs. ...uqqa may find its explanation in these terms. However, the Assuwa League included Karkija (Caria), in southwest Anatolia, south of even the proposed Lukka (Lycia). So, since also Assuwa was only a confederate league, it could easily have included a wide-ranging array of anti-Hittite minor powers, across the region.
This confederacy is mentioned only in the fragmentary tablets making up Laroche's CTH 142/85. Since the later Tudhaliya IV was known to have had frontier trouble between 1250 and 1200 BC,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] and since the text lists rebel nations in much the way Ramesses II does, the first consensus dated this text - and so Assuwa - to Tudhaliyas IV. This dating appears in all older literature on the fall of the Hatti, and crops up every now and then to this day. However the consensus has since then come around to dating Assuwa to an earlier Tudhaliyas, which means prior to Suppiluliumas and so prior to 1350 BC.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Assuwa has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent Asia (Bossert, 1946).

U.S. Route 730 (US 730) is an east–west United States Highway, of which all but 6.08 miles of its 41.78 miles (9.78 of 67.24 km) are within the state of Oregon. The highway starts in rural Morrow County in Eastern Oregon at an interchange with Interstate 84 (I-84) and US 30, located east of the city of Boardman. US 730 travels east along the Columbia River as a continuation of Columbia River Highway No. 2 into Umatilla County, intersecting I-82 and US 395 in the city of Umatilla. US 730 and US 395 form a short concurrency within the city before the highways part, with US 730 continuing northeast into Washington. The highway travels through rural Walla Walla County and ends at an intersection with US 12 south of Wallula.
US 730 was created with the original United States Highways on November 11, 1926, traveling on the existing Columbia River Highway, established in 1917, from US 30 in Umatilla to US 410 south of Wallula. The Washington section of US 730 was added to the state highway system in 1923 as a branch of State Road 3, later becoming a branch of Primary State Highway 3 (PSH 3) in 1937. The highway was concurrent with US 395 from 1937 until 1985, traveling from Cold Springs Junction to US 410. US 30 was moved to a new route bypassing Umatilla and Irrigon in 1946, allowing for US 730 to be extended southwest to Boardman, later to an interchange with I-84.

Like most first generation DMUs they were originally BR Green, then plain blue, and finally blue and grey, with a few receiving Network SouthEast livery.  One set was famously painted in all over yellow with advertisements for British Telecom.
A normal formation was three vehicles- a Driving Motor Brake Second (DMBS) which had two BUT engines (Later fitted with Leyland), a driving compartment(cab), 65 second class seats, guards accommodation and luggage/parcels space, a Trailer Composite Lavatory (TCL) which had no engines or driving compartment, but had 22 first class seats, 48 second class seats and a lavatory, and a Driving Motor Second (DMS), which like the DMBS had two engines and a driver's cab, and contained 89 second class seats.  Having the 'blue square' multiple working system allowed them to run in formations containing up to 12 cars with most of BR's other DMUs.
Two vehicles were converted to sandite use.

[[Two-vector]]
CATEGORIES: Tensors

A two-vector is a tensor of type (2,0) and it is the dual of a two-form, meaning that it is a linear functional which maps two-forms to the real numbers (or more generally, to scalars).
The tensor product of a pair of vectors is a two-vector.  Then, any two-form can be expressed as a linear combination of tensor products of pairs of vectors, especially a linear combination of tensor products of pairs of basis vectors.  If f is a two-vector, then
where the f α β are the components of the two-vector.  Notice that both indices of the components are contravariant.  This is always the case for two-vectors, by definition.
An example of a two-vector is the inverse gμ ν of the metric tensor.
The components of  a two-vector may be represented in a matrix-like array.  However, a two-vector, as a tensor, should not be confused with a matrix, since a matrix is a linear function
which maps vectors to vectors, whereas a two-vector is a linear functional
which maps one-forms to vectors.  In this sense, a matrix, considered as a tensor, is a mixed tensor of type (1,1) even though of the same rank as a two-vector.

[[Numerical taxonomy]]

CATEGORIES: Classification systems, Taxonomy

Numerical taxonomy  is a classification system in biological systematics which deals with the grouping by numerical methods of taxonomic units based on their character states.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=461900&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d461900 |title=Numerical Taxonomy (biology) |author= |date= |work=www.accessscience.com |publisher=McGraw Hill Ltd. |accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] It aims to create a taxonomy using numeric algorithms like cluster analysis rather than using subjective evaluation of their properties. The concept was first developed by Robert R. Sokal & Peter H. A. Sneath in 1963Sokal & Sneath: Principles of Numerical Taxonomy, San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1963 and later elaborated by the same authors.Sneath and Sokal: Numerical Taxonomy, San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1973 They divided the field into phenetics in which classifications are formed based on the patterns of overall similarities and cladistics in which classifications are based on the branching patterns of the estimated evolutionary history of the taxa. Note: in recent years many authors treat numerical taxonomy and phenetics as synonyms despite the distinctions made by those authors. 
Although intended as an objective method, in practice the choice and implicit or explicit weighting of characteristics is influenced by available data and research interests of the investigator. What was made objective was the introduction of explicit steps to be used to create dendrograms and cladograms using numerical methods rather than subjective synthesis of data.

[[Property of Baire]]
CATEGORIES: Descriptive set theory, Determinacy

The family of sets with the property of Baire forms a σ-algebra. That is, the complement of an almost open set is almost open, and any countable union or intersection of almost open sets is again almost open.  Since every open set is almost open (the empty set is meager), it follows that every Borel set is almost open.
If a subset of a Polish space has the property of Baire, then its corresponding Banach-Mazur game is determined.  The converse does not hold; however, if every game in a given adequate pointclass Γ is determined, then every set in Γ has the property of Baire. Therefore it follows from projective determinacy, which in turn follows from sufficient large cardinals, that every projective set (in a Polish space) has the property of Baire.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
It follows from the axiom of choice that there are sets of reals without the property of Baire.  In particular, the Vitali set does not have the property of Baire.[tpl]harvtxt|Oxtoby|1980[/tpl], p. 22.  Already weaker versions of choice are sufficient: the Boolean prime ideal theorem implies that there is a nonprincipal ultrafilter on the set of natural numbers; each such ultrafilter induces, via binary representations of reals, a set of reals without the Baire property.[ref]

Drill bits are the cutting tools of drilling machines. They can be made in any size to order, but standards organizations have defined sets of sizes that are produced routinely by drill bit manufacturers and stocked by distributors.
In the U.S., fractional inch and gauge drill bit sizes are in common use. In nearly all other countries, metric drill bit sizes are most common, and all others are anachronisms or are reserved for dealing with designs from the US. The British Standards on replacing gauge size drill bits with metric sizes in the UK was first published in 1959.

Melville Corporation, formerly based in Rye, New York, was a large retail holding corporation incorporated in 1922 as the Melville Shoe company by Ward Melville. It changed its  name to CVS Corporation in 1996.  The company traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker MES, before changing its ticker to CVS.
At its peak, Melville operated over 7,282 retail stores in approximately 3,500 unique locations, providing a wide range of products.
Melville was one of the first companies in the world to develop a shared-services satellite communications network, consolidating the infrastructure of all of its discrete divisions, resulting in significant cost savings for the corporation.  
Beginning in the early 1990s, Melville was under pressure to reorganize and shed its diverse portfolio.  Many of the chains the company operated were underperforming.
The chain shed all of its retail chains, except for CVS, which accounted for 40% of Melville's revenue.  Its Peoples, Standard Drug, and Austin Drug pharmacies were converted to the CVS identity.  Most of the company's units that were unrelated to its pharmacy business were shed in 1996.
Many of the retail divisions that Melville once owned still operate either as independent companies or as subsidiaries of other companies.

"The writing on the wall", or "the handwriting on the wall", or "the writing is on the wall" or "''Mene Mene''", is an idiom for "the future is predetermined", and is generally implied that a bad event is imminent.
The expression originates from the Book of Daniel (Old Testament), Chapter 5, from the handwriting on the wall that was witnessed at a banquet hosted by King Belshazzar. As those at the feast profaned the sacred vessels pillaged from the Jerusalem Temple, a disembodied hand appeared and wrote on the palace wall the words, "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin". The visionary Daniel was summoned and interpreted this message as the imminent end for the Babylonian kingdom. That night, Belshazzar was killed and the Persians sacked the capital city.[tpl]cite book|last=Elwell|first=Philip Comfort, Walter A.|title=The complete book of who's who in the Bible|year=2004|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers|location=Wheaton, Ill.|isbn=0842383697|page=113[/tpl]

[[Senbei]]
CATEGORIES: Japanese cuisine, Japanese snack food, Rice crackers, Wagashi, Beika

[tpl]Nihongo|Senbei|煎餅|extra=alternatively spelled sembei[/tpl] are a type of Japanese rice crackers. They come in various shapes, sizes, and flavors, usually savory but sometimes sweet. Senbei are often eaten with green tea as a casual snack and offered to visiting house guests as a courtesy refreshment.
Senbei are usually cooked by being baked or grilled, traditionally over charcoal. While being prepared they may be brushed with a flavoring sauce, often one made of soy sauce and mirin. They may then be wrapped with a layer of nori. Alternatively they may be flavored with salt or "salad" flavoring, among others.
In China, the same characters used to write senbei are read jiānbǐng (煎餅). There are varieties like Shandong Jianbing and Tianjin Jianbing.  However, these are in actuality a different food. In China, they are more like wraps and pancakes, similar to okonomiyaki, whereas in Japan they are hard (not floppy), and are bite-sized snacks rather than meals.  However, crackers similar to Japanese senbei can be found in China today. Their modern Chinese name is 仙贝 (or 鲜贝) (Pinyin: xianbei), which reflects the Japanese-language pronunciation of "senbei" (煎餅).
Sweet senbei (甘味煎餅) came to Japan during the Tang Dynasty, the first recorded usage in 737 AD, and still are very similar to Tang traditional styles, originally often baked in the Kansai area, of which include the traditional "roof tile" senbei. These include ingredients like potato and wheat flour or glutinous rice, and are similar to castella cakes. (Distinctly different from what most people would consider as Senbei today).
What Japanese commonly refer to as senbei nowadays was popularized by a shop in the Edo Period, Sōkajuku, which spread salty soy sauce flavored senbei throughout Japan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
There are several types of traditional Japanese senbei.  They include the 2 categories, sweet sembei (over 15 types)[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] and rice candy senbei (米菓煎餅), and others, which include even fish senbei (魚せんべい), lotus senbei (蓮根煎餅) and bone senbei (骨せんべい).
Modern senbei versions are very inventive and may include flavorings can which range from kimchi to wasabi to curry to chocolate.
Kansai senbei tend to use glutinous rice and have a lightly seasoned and delicate in texture (saku saku). Kantō senbei were originally based on uruchimai, a non-glutinous rice, and they tend to be more crunchy (kari kari) and richly flavored.
Thin Japanese rice crackers (薄焼きせんべい　usuyaki senbei) are popular in Australia and other countries.[tpl]cite web|title=HISTORY|url=http://www.sakata.com.au/history.htm|accessdate=March 7, 2013[/tpl]

[[PLUM keyboard]]
CATEGORIES: Latin-script keyboard layouts

The PLUM keyboard is a computer keyboard which varies from the traditional QWERTY keyboard in both physical key layout and letter arrangement. Unlike most keyboards, the PLUM keyboard organizes keys in a square grid, as opposed to the staggered rows of a typewriter.  Though the Plum Keyboard is currently off-line, it is still being promoted.  Also, the purpose of the product is to teach non typists how to type and not to encourage Qwerty users to switch.  The ergonomic advantages are secondary to the incredibly short learning curve.  New typists learning Qwerty can typically expect a 4- to 6-week learning curve, whereas new typists learning Plum can touch-type within two weeks.  This is possible because Plum incorporates mnemonics to assist the learner.  "READONTHIS" is not only easily remembered, they are the ten most frequently used keys and make up the home row where the fingers rest, thus minimizing finger movement.  The Plum layout also gives equal time to each hand.  With Qwerty, the left hand does 70% of the work, while the right hand does only 30%. 
thumb|left|All PLUM keyboards look the same.It is notable that the Enter key has moved to a half-length "spacebar" position alongside the spacebar itself. Each is now used by one thumb alone; left for Enter and right for Space.  Also, the Tab and Backspace keys are conveniently and centrally located within the array of letters, as are the comma and period.
The layout of the PLUM keyboard is compact, using standard key sizes throughout, rather than the usual widened keytops for control keys. This has led to criticism, particularly over the positioning of the Shift keys. These are at each end of the home row. Although usable for text entry by a touch-typist experienced with the PLUM layout, they are unpopular with programmers who make extensive use of shift for non-letter characters. The extra Function keys F13, F14, and F15 map to Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and the Pause/Break key respectively, although no Scroll Lock light exists. There are also six blank keys surrounding the Arrow keys, which do nothing.
It is debatable whether this layout reduces repetitive strain injury, but the general consensus[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] is that while it might prolong it slightly, the QWERTY keyboard might simply aggravate pains without causing the disease, and studies have shown that typists are not any more likely to develop RSI than normal people. Users of PLUM keyboards, however have claimed that after switching keyboard layouts, their pains went away. While there are currently no good studies comparing the efficiency of the PLUM and Dvorak keyboards, the Dvorak keyboard is more mainstream, but the PLUM keyboard has a keyboard layout that many find more memorable, with the rows spelling out the words "PLUM" and "READONTHIS".
PLUM keyboards are no longer manufactured at this writing.

[[Kalina cycle]]
CATEGORIES: Thermodynamic cycles

The Kalina cycle, developed by Dr. Alexander Kalina is a thermodynamic process for converting thermal energy into usable mechanical power.
It uses a solution of 2 fluids with different boiling points for its working fluid.  Since the solution boils over a range of temperatures as in distillation, more of the heat can be extracted from the source than with a pure working fluid.  The same applies on the exhaust (condensing) end.  This provides efficiency comparable to a Combined cycle, with less complexity.http://vganapathy.tripod.com/kalina.html Overview of the Kalina cycle
By appropriate choice of the ratio between the components of the solution, the boiling point of the working solution can be adjusted to suit the heat input temperature.  Water and ammonia is the most widely used combination, but other combinations are feasible.
Because of this ability to take full advantage of the temperature difference between the particular heat source and sink available, it finds applications in reuse of industrial process heat, geothermal energy, solar energy, and use of waste heat from power plants (Bottoming cycle).

Mincome was an experimental Canadian basic income project that was held in Dauphin, Manitoba during the 1970s.  The project, funded jointly by the Manitoba provincial government and the Canadian federal government, began with a news release on February 22, 1974, and was closed down in 1979.  The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a guaranteed, unconditional annual income caused disincentive to work for the recipients, and how great such a disincentive would be.
It allowed every family unit to receive a minimum cash benefit. The results showed a modest impact on labor markets, with working hours dropping one percent for men, three percent for wives, and five percent for unmarried women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.irpp.org/po/archive/jan01/hum.pdf |title=A Guaranteed Annual Income? From Mincome to the Millennium |publisher=Policy Options/Options Politique |author=Derek Hum & Wayne Simpson |date=2001-01-02 |pages=78–82[/tpl] However, some have argued these drops may be artificially low because participants knew the guaranteed income was temporary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title=Improving Social Security in Canada—Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher=Canadian Social Research Links |year=1994 |accessdate=2013-05-10[/tpl] These decreases in hours worked may be seen as offset by the opportunity cost of more time for family and education. Mothers spent more time rearing newborns, and the educational impacts are regarded as a success. Students in these families showed higher test scores and lower dropout rates. There was also an increase in adults continuing education.Salkind, N.J. & Haskins, R. (1982). Negative income tax: The impact on children from low-income families.

Mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies, and teenagers worked less because they weren't under as much pressure to support their families, which resulted in more teenagers graduating. In addition, those who continued to work were given more opportunities to choose what type of work they did.

Out of the Blue is an American fantasy sitcom that aired on ABC during the fall of 1979. It is chiefly notable as having featured a Mork & Mindy crossover, and for the controversy surrounding its status as a spin-off of Happy Days.
The series stars Jimmy Brogan as Random, an angel-in-training who is assigned to live with (and act as guardian angel for) a family and work as a high school teacher. The series aired from September 9 to December 16, 1979.  Nine episodes had been aired at the time of cancellation.  Some completed material was never broadcast.

"Sincerely" is a popular song written by Harvey Fuqua and Alan Freed and published in 1954.
It was originally recorded by The Moonglows, who scored a #1 one single on the Billboard R&B Juke Box chart and #20 on the Billboard Top 100 charts.[tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=411[/tpl] The best-selling version was a pop cover recorded by The McGuire Sisters, entering the charts in 1954 and reaching number one the next year. Many R&B collectors decry the cover version by the McGuire Sisters which kept the Moonglows off the Pop charts, but the Moonglows' version stole lyrics from a 1951 Dominoes tune, "That's What You're Doing To Me". The bridge in both songs is almost identical: "Lord, won't you tell me/ Why I love that woman so?/ She doesn't want me/ But I'll never let her go". In 1988 the country quartet Forester Sisters reached #8 on the Billboard Hot Country chart with their remake of the song.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]

San Cristóbal de La Laguna (commonly known as La Laguna) is a city and municipality in the northern part of the island of Tenerife in the Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, on the Canary Islands, (Spain). The city is the third-most populous city of the archipelago and the second-most populous city of the island. La Laguna's historical center was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999. In 2003 the municipality started an ambitious Urban Plan to renew this area, that was carried out by the firm AUC S.L. (Arquitectura Urbanismo y Cooperación). The city was the ancient capital of the Canary Islands.http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/diccionario-arquitectura-construccion/san-cristobal-de-la-laguna/ La Laguna lies right alongside the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, thus the two cities and municipalities form a single large urban center, linked by tram.http://www.tenerife2.com/ciudades/lalaguna.htmlhttp://google.com/search?q=cache:tCsGMRr9ya4J:www.tenerife.es/planes/PTEOSistemaViarioAMetro/adjuntos/II0206a.pdf+tenerife+unico+casco+urbano+unidas+santa+cruz+la+laguna&cd=6&hl=es&ct=clnk&gl=eshttp://dracma.free.fr/tenerife.html
The city is home to the University of La Laguna which is home to 30,000 students; these are not included in the population figures for the city. La Laguna is considered to be the cultural capital of the Canary Islands. Also there is in the habit of being calling the "City of the Anticipated ones", for having been the first university city of the archipelago.
Its economy is business-oriented while agriculture dominates the northeastern portion of the city. The urban area dominates the central and the southern parts. Tourism covers the northern coast. The main industry includes some manufacturing. The industrial area is made up of the main subdivisions of Majuelos, Las Torres de Taco, Las Mantecas and Las Chumberas. In this city one finds the legendary house of the spectre of Catalina Lercaro, as well as the incorrupt body of sister Sor María de Jesús, and the Christ of La Laguna (Cristo de La Laguna). Another emblematic building of the city is the Cathedral of La Laguna, which is the catholic cathedral of Tenerife and his diocese (Diocese of Tenerife).
In 2010 after a survey, La Laguna was listed as the city with the best reputation in the Canary Islands and the third provincial capital city of Spain with the best reputation, behind Gijon and Marbella.Estadísticas de Merco Ciudad

It is on the north-east fringe of Greater London.

Accessed 25 September 2008). In 1752, the estate was sold to Thomas Tower of Iver in Buckinghamshire, a lawyer and MP for Wareham in Dorset. Christopher Tower succeeded as the owner in 1778 and immediately commissioned Robert Adam to design a new dining room. On his death in 1810, his son, Christopher Thomas Tower, succeeded until 1867; he enlarged the estate and enclosed some commons as "waste".

The 16th-century lodge miscalled "Queen Mary's Chapel" because it was locally rumoured to have been used by Queen Mary for quiet prayer and contemplation, which used to be enclosed within  Weald Hall's walled kitchen garden, still remains at the edge of the park.
A very large (2.8 by 4.8 metres) painting of Weald Hall hung in a dining room at nearby Brentwood School. Depicting the house and park before 18th Century alterations it is attributed to Dutch painter Jan Griffier the Elder (1652-1718). The school, which was founded by a former owner of the Hall, Sir Anthony Browne, sold the painting to a private collector at Sotheby's in November 1985.

Karl Emil Franzos (October 25, 1848 – January 28, 1904) was a popular Austrian novelist of the late the 19th century. His works, both reportage and fiction, concentrate on the multi-ethnic corner of Galicia, Podolia and Bukovina, now largely in Ukraine, where the Habsburg and Russian empires met. This area became so closely associated with his name that one critic called it “Franzos country”. A number of his books were translated into English, and Gladstone is said to have been among his admirers.

[[Anderson localization]]

CATEGORIES: Mesoscopic physics, Condensed matter physics

In condensed matter physics, Anderson localization, also known as strong localization, is the absence of diffusion of waves in a disordered medium. This phenomenon is named after the American physicist P. W. Anderson, who was the first one to suggest the possibility of electron localization inside a semiconductor, provided that the degree of  randomness of the impurities or defects is sufficiently large.[tpl] cite journal | last = Anderson | first = P. W. | authorlink = | year = 1958 | title = Absence of Diffusion in Certain Random Lattices | journal = Phys. Rev. | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 1492–1505 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.109.1492 | url = | accessdate = | quote = |bibcode = 1958PhRv..109.1492A [/tpl]
Anderson localization is a general wave phenomenon that applies to the transport of electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, quantum waves, spin waves, etc. This phenomenon is to be distinguished from weak localization, which is the precursor effect of Anderson localization (see below), and from Mott localization, named after Sir Nevill Mott, where the transition from metallic to insulating behaviour is not due to disorder, but  to  a strong mutual Coulomb repulsion of  electrons.

[[Joy (Skids album)]]
CATEGORIES: Skids (band) albums, 1981 albums, Virgin Records albums

Joy is the final album by the Scottish band Skids. It was the fourth studio record and their first after the departure of signature guitarist Stuart Adamson, who then founded Big Country. As such, it represented a change of direction from rock to folk music, amplifying the traditional Scottish element already hinted at in previous releases.
The band line-up featured Richard Jobson and Russell Webb, with J. J. Johnson (drums/percussion), Paul Wishart (saxophone/flute/keyboards/percussion/vocals) & a collection of musical friends. They all went to Britannia Row Studios in London for rehearsals and song development. Sessions in July 1981 led to the release of the first single from the upcoming album.
The single "Fields" (Virgin VS-401) was released in August 1981, with Kenny Hyslop on drums. The song also featured Billy MacKenzie (vocals), and Alan Rankine (guitar), who were the core members of the band The Associates. Guesting, early in her career, was Virginia Astley (flute). The strummed guitar and marching band elements (bagpipe emulation, percussion) signalled a change in direction, though the rabble-rousing melody and football pitch vocal delivery were standard Skids fare.
Sessions continued through September 1981 and produced a second single, the harmonically rich Iona (named for the Scottish island). It was the only song on the album to be recorded at Highland Studios in Inverness, Scotland. Released in October 1981 (as Virgin VS-449) this was the last Skids track to feature Adamson, alongside Mike Oldfield. At 3:24 the single edit is significantly shorter than the epic to be found on the album.
Joy was issued November 1981 (as Virgin V-2217). It marks a concerted effort to update traditional Scottish music into the age of modern rock recordings. The sound is fundamentally more pastoral than previous Skids efforts. Gone are the layers of harmonically treated electric guitar. However, elements of this style were hinted at previously, particularly on the Strength Through Joy mini-album. The lyrical concerns of strife, war and brotherhood are Jobson staples.
With Paul Wishart on saxophone, "And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda" is a cover version of the song by Eric Bogle.
Although the band recorded a BBC Radio 1 session and shot a music video for "Iona", promotion problems at Virgin forestalled a tour. With patchy coverage, no live support and a difficult change in musical direction, the record sank without a trace. Critical reception was mixed at best. For example Trouser Press wrote "To call it bad is curt but realistic,"Trouser Press entry for Skids and Allmusic calls it "a gloomy conclusion to what was once a most vibrant band."Allmusic review The Guardian, however, greeted it happily.Liner notes from Fanfare by John Peel, 1982 Scroll down page: no direct link to article available
The album bore fruit in several working relationships. For example, Virginia Astley was to record her debut solo releases with Russell Webb and also guests on Jobson's poetry album "The Ballad Of Etiquette".
Later, Skids split up and the remaining members Richard Jobson and Russell Webb formed The Armoury Show, with Magazine's John McGeoch and John Doyle shortly afterwards.
This album remains unreleased on CD, but was released in MP3 format on 7 December 2009, including several alternate single mixes as bonus tracks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002XOU3Y4 |title=Joy (plus Bonus Tracks) |website=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=2014-04-13[/tpl]

[[Northwest Territories general election, 1902]]

CATEGORIES: 1902 elections in Canada, 1902 in Canada, Elections in the Northwest Territories

The Northwest Territories general election of 1902, occurred on 21 May 1902 and was the fifth general election in the history of the Northwest Territories, Canada. It was held to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories.  This was the  last election held until 1951, and was the last in the Northwest Territories to have political parties. 
Frederick W. A. G. Haultain and the Liberal-Conservatives continued with government. Donald H. McDonald was thrust into being the Liberal leader just days before the vote, with the surprise decision by Robert Brett to drop out of the race.
In 1905, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created out of NWT territory, and they took most of the voting population with them. The government of NWT reverted to an appointed consensus model of government.
Candidates in this election were not nominated by the party in a contested nomination as with modern elections, but rather proclaimed their support for the governing party or opposition party, or Independent. During the election race some candidates shifted their alignment. The result was a confusing mess, and the bulk of candidates proclaimed support for the already governing Liberal-Conservative party, leaving the Liberals without candidates in many districts. Lethbridge ended up being contested by two government supporting candidates.
1902 would also see the largest number of MLAs elected to the Northwest Territories Legislature in the territories history.

[[Offa of Essex]]
CATEGORIES: East Saxon monarchs, 8th-century English monarchs, 8th-century English people, Monarchs who abdicated

Offa was King of Essex until 709, when he abdicated in order that he may take up life in a monastery in Rome along with Cenred, King of Mercia. He was the son of Sigeheard of Essex, and, according to some sources, St. Osyth, (though Bede, a contemporary, makes no mention of her).[tpl]Citation needed|date= October 2011[/tpl]
In his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, Bede  described him as "a youth of most lovely age and beauty, and most earnestly desired by all his nation to be their king. He, with like devotion, quit his wife, lands, kindred and country, for Christ and for the Gospel, that he might receive an hundredfold in this life, and in the world to Come life everlasting. He also, when they came to the holy places at Rome, receiving the tonsure, and adopting a monastic life, attained the long wished-for sight of the blessed apostles in heaven." Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, Book V
A charter related to land in Warwickshire (S64) is attributed to him, although in it he is described as King of Mercia rather than Essex.PH Sawyer, Anglo-Saxon Charters (Royal Historical Society, 1968) This may be an inaccurate copy based on an authentic charter by Cenred of Mercia.Electronic Sawyer There is a (probably authentic) lost charter (S1784) in which Offa grants land in Hemel Hempstead to the bishop of London.[tpl]Citation needed|date= October 2011[/tpl]
He was succeeded by Saelred of Essex.

CATEGORIES: International auxiliary languages, Esperantido

Mundolinco is a constructed language created by the Dutch author J. Braakman in 1888. It is notable for apparently being the first Esperantido, i.e. the first Esperanto derivative.
Major changes from Esperanto include combining the adjective and adverb with the grammatical ending -e (where Esperanto uses -a for adjectives and -e for adverbs), changes to the verb conjugations, an increase in the number of Latin roots, and new affixes such as the superlative suffix -osim- where Esperanto uses the particle plej. It seems there was no accusative or adjectival agreement. 
Numerals 1–10: un, du, tres, cvarto, cvinto, siso, septo, octo, nono, desem.

Minto (2011 pop. 2,505)Statistics Canada "Community Profiles: Minto, New Brunswick (Village)", March 30, 2011, accessed August 4, 2011. is a Canadian village straddling the border of Sunbury County and Queens County, New Brunswick.  Located on the north shore of Grand Lake, approximately 50 kilometres northeast of Fredericton, its population meets the requirements for "town" status under the Municipalities Act of the Province of New Brunswick, however the community has not made any change in municipal status.
Minto was originally named Northfield but it is known to have taken its present name in 1904 upon the retirement of Canada's eighth Governor General, The Earl of Minto.  However, the village was known as Minto since 1902,"Newcastle Creek: The Great Coal Mining Centre of New Brunswick.", St. John Daily Sun, October 29, 1902, accessed August 5, 2011. and the story remains that the village adopted its name from the local Minto Hotel.  From the St. John Daily Sun of 1903:  "Just how the name of Minto came to be adopted is said to have occurred in this way.  A letter which was sent from Moncton to Mr. Kennedy was enclosed in an envelope which bore the name of the Minto hotel, Moncton.  The family thought Minto a good name for their hotel, and so it was named.  Then the people generally adopted the name for the place, and so the railway people designated it.""Newcastle Coal Fields.", St. John Daily Sun, September 7, 1903, accessed August 5, 2011.

[[Ashleigh Brilliant]]

CATEGORIES: American cartoonists, British cartoonists, Epigrammatists, Artists from London, Writers from California, 1933 births, Living people

Ashleigh Ellwood Brilliant (born 9 December 1933) is an author and syndicated cartoonist born in London, UK, and living in Santa Barbara, California, USA.  He is best known for his Pot-Shots, single-panel illustrations with one-line humorous remarks, which began syndication in the United States of America in 1975.  Brilliant achieved American citizenship in 1969.
Brilliant attended Hendon School (then Hendon County School), London, in the 1940s–50s. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a PhD in history in 1964 and taught on a "Floating University", an educational cruise ship that traveled around the world in the mid-60s.  He later taught at a community college in Bend, Oregon.
During the "Summer of Love" in San Francisco in 1967, Brilliant gave daily lectures near the Haight Street entrance of Golden Gate Park. He released a live album recorded in Golden Gate Park in 1967 on a small Hollywood, California record label, Dorash Enterprises (Dorash LP-1001). The album, Ashleigh Brilliant in the Haight-Ashbury, is quite rare today. The material uses familiar public domain songs and melodies and incorporates clever poetic lyrics about marijuana, the Diggers, San Francisco neighborhoods, and his personal experiences, all the while displaying a banter which ebbs and flows with his audience, who respond warmly to the performance and also participate in the songs. He states in the recording that he had been performing in this setting for approximately two hours each day the prior four weeks. He laughs throughout his performance, while the audience joins him in singing along and banging on percussive items. The album ends with a "Haight-Ashbury Farewell".
The Wall Street Journal described him in a 1992 profile as "history's only full time, professional published epigrammatist."[tpl]cite news|last=Stevens|first=Amy|title=Exactly how Many Brilliant Thoughts are there? 5,632 --- Mr. Brilliant Wrote them -- and Copyrighted them; You must Know no. 1041.|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=6 January 1992|page=A.1[/tpl]
At one time, there was some confusion and controversy as to the ownership and recognition of his distinctive art form.  In a copyright infringement suit filed by Brilliant, a United States federal judge ruled that while short phrases are not eligible for copyright, Brilliant's works were epigrams and therefore copyrightable (Brilliant v. W.B. Productions Inc., 1979).
While Brilliant employs a self-imposed limit of 17 words per epigram, he has actually written and published 41 with 18 words and one with 19 words (By the miracle of teaching, I can give you some of my ability, without losing any of it myself.)
In 1999 he authored the "Y1K Crisis" article which parodies the "Y2K Crisis" of 1999.Ashleigh Brilliant – Writings
Part of the counter-culture scene in San Francisco in the late 1960s, Brilliant wrote and sang a series of parody songs about the hippie movement in Golden Gate Park as the hippie movement happened.  Called "The Haight-Ashbury Songbook, the songs now appear on a CD collection available on his website.
Brilliant is frequently asked about his real last name, of which he says:
  
 As far as I know, the name Brilliant is of Russian/Polish/Jewish origin, and is akin to other Jewish names related to precious metals and jewels, e.g. Gold, Silver, Diamond, Ruby, Pearl. (One meaning of brilliant is a kind of diamond.)  These in turn relate to the kinds of trades in which many European Jews were engaged when, in the time of Napoleon, they were first required to take surnames.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]

Brilliant celebrated his 80th birthday in December 2013 in Franceschi Park in his current home town of Santa Barbara, California.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2013/dec/11/ashleigh-brilliant-celebrates-80th-birthday |title=Ashleigh Brilliant Celebrates 80th Birthday |date=11 December 2013 |author=Lyz Hoffman |accessdate=2014-01-03 |publisher=Santa Barbara Independent[/tpl] There he was presented with a document signed by the mayor proclaiming him to be the "Wise Old Man of the Mountain".

Francis Wilkinson Pickens (April 7, 1805[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]January 25, 1869) was Governor of South Carolina when that state became the first to secede from the U.S.A.
A cousin of Senator John C. Calhoun, Pickens was born into the culture of States Rights, and became an ardent supporter of nullification (refusal to pay federal import tariffs) when he served in the South Carolina house of representatives, before being elected to Congress and then the state senate.
As state governor during the Fort Sumter crisis, he sanctioned the firing on the ship bringing supplies to the beleaguered Union garrison, and to the bombardment of the fort.
After the war, it was Pickens who introduced the motion to repeal South Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession, a short speech received in silence, in notable contrast with the rejoicing that had first greeted the Ordinance.

Surrender in military terms is the relinquishment of control over territory, combatants, fortifications, ships, or armament to another power. A surrender may be accomplished peacefully, without fighting; or it may be the result of defeat in battle. A sovereign state may surrender following defeat in a war, usually by signing a peace treaty or capitulation agreement. A battlefield surrender, either by individuals or when ordered by officers, will normally result in those surrendering becoming prisoners of war.

[[Nelson Hackett]]

CATEGORIES: 1810 births, Year of death missing, American slaves, African-American people, People extradited from Canada to the United States

Nelson Hackett (born c. 1810) was an escaped slave who fled to Canada.  In 1841 he escaped from his Arkansas master, Alfred Wallace on a stolen horse, and 6 weeks later crossed the border and entered Canada.
Wallace, however, refused to let the matter drop, and he was well connected, particularly to the Governor of Arkansas, Archibald Yell.  Wallace and an associate, George C. Grigg, travelled to Canada and made out dispositions against Hackett for stealing the horse, as well as a gold watch belonging to Wallace.
Despite opposition from Upper Canada's attorney general, William Henry Draper, Hackett was extradited to the United States on the order of Sir Charles Bagot, due to his theft of the watch.
Public reaction from abolitionists, in England, Canada and the United States was strong.  Politicians in the British House of Commons and Upper Canada's executive council questioned the motives for the extradition, as well as its legality.
Wallace seems to have been intent on "teaching a lesson" to American slaves; namely that Canada would not prove to be a safe haven for them.  The fact that his legal bills far exceeded Hackett's market value seems to bear this out. In any event, his strategy failed. Hackett's escape brought more attention to Canada as a refuge for slaves, and when the extradition clause of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty was finally negotiated, slaves were protected from extradition to their former American masters.

[[European Train Control System]]
CATEGORIES: European Rail Traffic Management System, Train protection systems, Railway signalling block systems

The European Train Control System (ETCS) is a signalling, control and
train protection system designed to replace the many incompatible safety systems currently used by European railways, especially on high-speed lines.
ETCS requires standard trackside equipment and a standard controller within the train cab. In its final form, all lineside information is passed to the driver electronically, removing the need for lineside signals which, at high speed, could be almost impossible to see or assimilate.
The need for ETCS stems from EU Directive 96/48 about the interoperability of high-speed trains, followed by Directive 2001/16 extending the concept of interoperability to the conventional rail system. ETCS specifications have become part, or are referred to, the technical specification for interoperability for (railway) control-command systems, which is a piece of European legislation managed by the European Railway Agency. It is a legal requirement that all newly built, upgraded or renewed tracks and rolling stock within the European railway system should adopt ETCS, possibly keeping legacy systems for backward compatibility. Many trains and networks outside the EU also adopted ETCS, generally for high-speed rail projects.
ETCS is specified at four different levels -

[[Christopher Alexander Hagerman]]

CATEGORIES: 1792 births, 1847 deaths, Lawyers in Ontario, Judges in Ontario, Members of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada

Christopher Alexander Hagerman (28 March 1792 – 14 May 1847) was a Canadian militia officer, politician, and judge.
Known as 'Handsome Kit', he was born at the Bay of Quinte, Adolphustown, Ontario. He was a son of United Empire Loyalist Major Nicholas Hagerman (1761–1819) J.P., and his wife Anne (1758–1847), daughter of John and Mary (Campbell) Fisher, formerly of Killin. Kit's grandfather, Christopher Hagerman (b.1722), was a Dutch officer in the service of the Prussian Army who had fought for George III at the Battle of Culloden. Following the Battle of Quebec (1759), he was granted 2,000 acres in Albany, New York. During the American Revolutionary War, Hagerman's father (Nicholas) came under suspicion from the Commission for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies and went over to the British in 1778. In Upper Canada, he signed with Captain Alexander White's company of Associated Loyalists and later settled with his servant in Adolphustown with the help of Peter Van Alstine. Kit Hagerman's uncle, Judge Alexander Fisher (1756–1830) M.P., of Adolphustown, was the father of Helen and Henrietta Fisher who married the brothers Thomas Kirkpatrick and Judge Stafford Kirkpatrick respectively. 
In 1807, Hagerman began his career in the law offices at Kingston, Ontario of his father, one of the first appointed barristers in Upper Canada. He served in his father's militia regiment during the War of 1812, becoming the aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Gordon Drummond, who regarded him highly, later gaining the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Having grown up outside John Strachan's inner circle, his military service and association with Drummond gave him the entree he needed for political success. 
After the war he was appointed the lucrative position of Collector of Customs at Kingston, also representing the riding of Kingston in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. Called to the Bar of Upper Canada in 1815, in 1829 he was appointed solicitor general for the province and in 1837 he became attorney general. He was a leading member and advocate of the Family Compact, a staunch conservative and well known for his loyalty to the Church of England. He was appointed judge for the Court of Queen's Bench in 1840.
Hagerman was an excellent and skilled orator and conversationalist. He was a powerfully built man, both bumptious and aggressive, and on one occasion horse whipped Robert Fleming Gourlay. As popular as he was within the Family Compact (he was a particular favourite of John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton), he was thoroughly hated by those outside the circle.  
He was married three times. In 1817 he married Elizabeth, daughter of James Macaulay. In England in 1834, he married Elizabeth Emily, daughter of the British Deputy Secretary at War, William  Merry (1762–1855) of Lansdowne Terrace, Cheltenham, by his wife Anne, daughter of Kender Mason of Beel House, Buckinghamshire, the sister of Henry Mason, who married a niece of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson. Two years later, again in England, he married Caroline, daughter of William George Daniel-Tyssen (1773–1838) of Foley House etc., High Sheriff of Kent, by his wife Amelia, only daughter and heiress of Captain John Amhurst R.N., of East Farleigh Court, Kent. Hagerman died at Toronto in 1847, the father of four children by his first marriage and a daughter by his second.
There was a township of "Hagerman" in Ontario named after him. Township of Hagerman was amalgamated with a few others to form Whitestone, Ontario.

[[New Dundee, Ontario]]

CATEGORIES: Communities in Waterloo Region, Ontario

New Dundee is a small community of about 1,500 people in the Township of Wilmot, Ontario, Canada, south-west of Kitchener.
It is home to the Dundee Country Club golf course and the New Dundee Emporium, founded in 1887.  Many small businesses are located within the community on Alder Lake.  Some businesses include fishing, canoeing and skating in the winter.  However, due to the locality to Kitchener, many residents tend to do most of their business outside of town in the larger urban centre.  This has caused trouble in sustaining local businesses. The award-winning New Dundee Emporium http://www.thenewdundeeemporium.com draws diners and shoppers from Waterloo Region and beyond to enjoy the fine cuisine, guided by chef Danny, and browse through the unique collection of women's clothing, handbags and jewellery, orchestrated by Mark. A full-service grocery store used to serve the town and surrounding area.  There is however a variety store that services the area that contains an LCBO and beer store.  Current businesses include a video store/ice cream shop, a busy branch of the Region of Waterloo Library, a pizza parlour/bakery, a hairstylist, a book store specializing in Christian books and, a pottery studio/ stained glass business including gallery and teaching area.
New Dundee Creamery, founded in 1908, was for many years the town's largest employer, with up to 100 employees at its peak.  By the mid-1960s, it was producing 115 million pounds of milk and five million pounds of butter a year.  It closed in 1998 and the vacant building was torn down in 2004.  A township proposal to build a park on the site was rejected by residents in 2005 due to its location to the main roads going through the town and the proposed loss of the main park at the corner of New Dundee and Main streets. The township is currently proposing a new park near the community centre that would keep the original park intact.
A lumber yard was also located in town and for many years was operated as Weber Home Centre (Castle Building Centre).  After its closing the location was bought and re-branded.  On June 1, 2006 Harron's Rona opened its doors to customers.  This became the new large employer in the small residential community with about 50 people from New Dundee and Kitchener-Waterloo area are employed there. On October 4, 2010 at 11:00 am the business closed its doors for good, declaring bankruptcy.
With the expiation of the surrounding urban areas, as well as, no major employer left, New Dundee has become a bedroom community with many residents working in Kitchener-Waterloo.
The village does not have a sewer system, and all properties must have a septic system installed. New Dundee's history is very religious, and many churches are still thriving today.

[[Florida Current]]
CATEGORIES: Ocean currents

The Florida Current is a thermal ocean current that flows generally from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean. The current was discovered by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León in 1513. 
The Florida Current results from the movement of water pushed from the Atlantic into the Caribbean Sea by the rotation of the Earth (which exerts a greater force at the equator).  The water piles up along Central America and flows northward through the Yucatán Channel into the Gulf of Mexico. The water is heated in the Gulf and forced out through the Florida Straits, between the Florida Keys and Cuba and flows northward along the east coast of the United States. The Florida Current is often referred to imprecisely as the Gulf Stream. In fact, the Florida Current joins the Gulf Stream off the east coast of Florida. 
The water reaches a velocity of 1.8 m/s or 3.6 knots.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a [tpl]vgy|2005[/tpl] computer and video game that was released right before the film release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Both the game and the movie are based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series.
The game follows the three main characters of the film — namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley — and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games.
In addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards.
There is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to "run around" such as in the previous games where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds.
The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.
It is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, its also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America.

[[Three-point field goal]]
CATEGORIES: Basketball terminology, American Basketball Association, American Basketball League (1961–63)

A three-point field goal (also known as a three-pointer, three, or trey) is a field goal in a basketball game made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc surrounding the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. In 3x3, a formalized version of half-court basketball, shots from outside the arc are worth 2 points, with all other successful shots worth 1 point.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/downloads/v3_abouFiba/3x3/3x3RulesOfTheGame.pdf |title=Article 9 Scoring |work=3x3 Rules of the Game |publisher=FIBA |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=November 2, 2012[/tpl]
A three-point field goal is distinguished from a "three-point play" or an "and-1", which occurs when a shooter successfully scores a two-point basket while being fouled, and then makes the ensuing free throw. If such a foul occurs on a successful three-point shot, the resulting free throw gives the player a chance to earn a four-point play. If a player gets fouled while shooting a three-point shot but does not score they get three free throws. In 3x3, a defensive foul on an unsuccessful shot from behind the arc results in two free throws.
Three-point field goal percentage is a measure of three-point shooting accuracy calculated by the ratio of three-point field goals made to three-point field goals attempted.

DATATRIEVE is a database query and report writer tool from Hewlett-Packard.  It runs on the OpenVMS operating system, as well as several PDP-11 operating systems.  DATATRIEVE's command structure is nearly plain English, and it is an early example of a Fourth Generation Language (4GL).  It works against flat files, indexed files, and databases.   Such data files are delimited using using record definitions stored in the Common Data Dictionary (CDD), or in RMS files.  DATATRIEVE is used at many OpenVMS installations.
DATATRIEVE was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by a team of software engineers at DEC's Central Commercial Engineering facilities in Merrimack and Nashua, New Hampshire, under database architect Jim Starkey. Many of the project's engineers went on to highly visible careers in database management and other software disciplines.
DATATRIEVE adopted the wombat as its notional mascot; the program's help file responded to “HELP WOMBAT” with factual information about real world wombats.

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Langemak is a prominent impact crater on the far side of the Moon. It is located less than one crater diameter west-northwest of Danjon, and nearly due east of Meitner. To the southwest of Langemak is Kondratyuk. Langemak partly overlies the larger and older crater Langemak N. This feature is also attached to the northeastern rim of Kondratyuk.
To the northeast of Langemak is the crater Necho, an impact feature that lies at the locus of a bright ray system. Ray material from this impact lies across the rim and interior of Langemak, particularly along the northwest and eastern halves.
The outer rim of Langemak is relatively fresh and well-defined. The most notable impact along the rim is the small crater Sherrington along the southwestern edge. The remainder of the rim is roughly circular, but irregular with multiple small outward bulges. The inner wall is terraced in places, with the appearance of slumping along parts of the upper edge.
Within the interior is a low, curving central ridge near the midpoint. There is a patch of lower albedo material to the southwest of this ridge, extending to the edge of the inner wall.

[[Vicia ervilia]]
CATEGORIES: Fabeae

Vicia ervilia, the bitter vetch, is an ancient grain legume crop of the Mediterranean region. Besides the English name, other common names include: gavdaneh (Persian), kersannah (Arabic), yero (Spanish), rovi (Greek), and burçak (Turkish).L.L. Bellido, "Grain legumes for animal feed" in Neglected  crops: 1492 from a different perspective, J.E. Bermejo and J. Leon, editors; Plant Production and Protection Series, No. 26 (Rome: FAO), pp. 273-288 The nutritional value of the grain for ruminant production has guaranteed the continued cultivation of V. ervilia in Morocco, Spain and Turkey. The crop is easy to cultivate and harvest and can be grown on very shallow, alkaline soils.
Bitter vetch grain when split resembles red lentils. For human consumption the bitterness of the seeds needs to be removed through leaching by several changes of boiling water. Owing to this bitterness, it is unlikely that someone would accidentally confuse bitter vetch with red lentils.Enneking & Francis (1997) "Development of Vicia ervilia as a grain crop for Southern Australia" According to Zohary and Hopf, only humans of the poorest economic classes consume this crop, or in times of famine;Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, Domestication of Plants in the Old World, third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 116. however, Pliny the Elder states that bitter vetch (ervum) has medicinal value like vetch (vicia), citing the letters of Augustus where the emperor wrote that he regained his health from a diet of bitter vetch (N.H. 18.38).
The grain is an excellent sheep and cattle feed concentrate. It has been held in high esteem by farmers in the Old World since the beginning of agriculture to improve the nutritional value of bulk feeds.
The wild strains of bitter vetch are limited to an area that includes Anatolia and northern Iraq, with an extension south along the Anti-Lebanon Mountains of Syria and Lebanon. Traces of the earliest domesticated instances were recovered from several archeological sites in Turkey, which have an uncorrected radiocarbon dating of the 7th and 6th millennia BC.

[[Laue (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Laue is a lunar impact crater that lies across the south-southwestern rim and interior floor of the huge walled plain Lorentz. This feature is located on the Moon's far side, just beyond the west-northwestern limb. This crater also is located to the left of Jake's house. Under conditions of favorable libration and illumination from the Sun, this area can be seen at a very oblique angle from the Earth.
This is a moderately worn crater formation with several small craters along the rim. The largest of these is a small crater that intrudes slightly into the northeastern rim. A cup-shaped crater lies along the east-southeastern inner wall. The interior wall is generally less wide along the northern side than elsewhere, which may have been the result of the terrain in which the impact was formed.
There is a pair of low central ridges offset just to the south of the crater midpoint. A small, cup-shaped crater lies within the interior floor to the north-northwest of the center. The remainder of the floor is relatively level, but is marked by a number of tiny craterlets.

Maksimilijan "Maks" Baće, also known as Milić (October 12, 1914, near Zadar –  2005http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20051210/osmrtnice01.asp), was a Croatian and Yugoslav revolutionary.BAĆE Mije MAKSIMILIJAN - MILIĆ
Born in Pakoštane (near Zadar) and raised in Split, he studied philosophy in Zagreb, became a student organizer and a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1934. While a student, for his anti-state activities, he was convicted and imprisoned for six months in Belgrade. After graduating in 1937 he left for Spain where he took part in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side until its conclusion. He was wounded twice, and after the republican defeat interned in Southern France and Germany where he worked in a Nazi airplane factory. He escaped and returned to Zagreb in the summer of 1941.
Experience gained in Spain proved valuable after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. His native Croatia was carved up between Italy and the Independent State of Croatia, with Italy fielding a strong occupation force in Dalmatia and Istria. Italian forces were supported by the pro-royal Chetniks in Serb-populated areas. The occupation led many Dalmatians to join the resistance organized by Tito's Partisans. The first detachments formed in Summer 1941 and manned by idealistic but inexperienced youths from coastal towns were poorly led and decimated by Italian units even before they began to operate in the Split hinterland in the vicinity of Sinj. This was a major blow to the resistance movement in Dalmatia. On his return to Zagreb Maks Baće was directed by the Party to travel to Split to discover the causes of that failure. He was then given the task of starting a new uprising which he organized in the region of the Biokovo mountain. He used the war pseudonym "Milić" in order to protect his family in Split and throughout the war people knew him only under that name.
Baće believed that the partisans should rely on the support of rural people in the hinterland, referred to by citifolk as "peasants," and his strategy began to bear fruit in early 1942 when the new partisan detachments proved to be more resilient and more effective in their battles with the Italian, Ustasha and Chetnik forces. "Milić" became a popular name among the peasants of the region and he created thousands of new soldiers as the volunteers joined the partisans in large numbers. During an operation in the vicinity of the Dalmatian village Tugare Maks Baće was shot through the chest and left by his comrades as dead. He survived thanks to the care of a local peasant family and then smuggled himself into Split where he reconvalesced. In 1943 he was appointed the commander-in-chief of Partisan Detachments in Dalmatia.
After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943 Maks Baće was the partisan officer who accepted the surrender of the Italian forces in Split, and the Partisans briefly took control of much of Dalmatia. However, they were soon expelled by the vastly stronger German forces which replaced the Italians. As one after the other of the Dalmatian islands fell to the Germans, partisan units withdrew to the most distant of them, the island of Vis. Maks Baće commanded the island and sent a controversial telegram to Josip Broz Tito requesting an order from him to defend the island. This he received, along with the reinforcement of another brigade of Partisan forces. A free Vis was later critical to Tito's own escape from German  airdrop encirclement in Bosnia (called "Operation Knight's Leap") of his Drvar headquarters, as well as the locus of early negotiations between partisans and the Allies. Liberated Vis also served as moral support for the partisans in the many periods of almost hopeless struggle with the militarily superior Germans. In 1944 Baće was one of the founders of OZNA. For his war service, Maks Baće received the coveted medal of the People's Hero of Yugoslavia.
After the war Maks Baće was a minister in the government of Yugoslavia, its ambassador to Japan and Sweden and then a member of the Federal Parliament and its Secretary.http://www.znaci.net/00001/10_8.htm He was a free thinker viewing party dogma critically and gradually became disillusioned with Communism and the ideological (as opposed to experience-based) political thinking of the regime. In 1971 during Croatian Spring he made the significant political statement of resigning from the Communist Party, and retired to Split, at which point he began to be viewed as a dissident. His absence from public life continued even after the arrival of democracy in the 1990s. When the Croatian media interviewed him at his 90th birthday, he revealed that he was working on a book critical of Karl Marx's thought. He died of natural causes in his family home at age 91.

Lents is a small lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon. It is located within the north-northwestern section of the immense skirt of ejecta that surrounds the Mare Orientale impact basin. To the south is the Montes Cordillera mountain ring, and to the north-northeast is the damaged crater Elvey.
This is a bowl-shaped formation with an interior floor that is about half the diameter of the crater. Attached to the northeastern exterior of Lents is the satellite crater Lents C, a feature of roughly the same dimension. Slightly more than a crater diameter to the east of Lents C is a smaller impact feature. This crater lies at the center of a broad, wispy ray system that extends for more than 100 km in all directions. The ray material from this impact lies across both Lents C and Lents, reaching as far north as Elvey.
On some maps this crater is called Lenz.

Class of '99 was a short-term alternative rock supergroup consisting of members from notable rock bands: Layne Staley of Alice in Chains as the vocalist, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine as lead guitarist, Stephen Perkins of Jane's Addiction as the drummer, and Martyn LeNoble of Porno for Pyros as bass guitarist. They also had the help of Matt Serletic on keyboards.
These four musicians collaborated to cover Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)" (as well as "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)") for the soundtrack to Robert Rodriguez's 1998 science-fiction horror film, The Faculty. Contrary to rumors and popular belief, the four musicians collaborated together solely to cover the songs for the film and did not create a band or intend on releasing other new material.
In 1999, a single of both versions was released on the Sony International record label. It also contained Stabbing Westward's "Haunting Me".
The "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)" video was directed by Jim Shea, and aired for the first time in January 1999.

Tinola in Tagalog or Cebuano, or la uya in Ilocano is a soup-based dish served as an appetizer or main entrée in the Philippines.[tpl]cite web | title=Tinola: A Favorite Philippine Cuisine | publisher=Philippines Insider| url=http://www.philippinesinsider.com/filipino-cuisine/recipes/tinola-a-favorite-philippine-cuisine/ | accessdate=2010-06-05[/tpl]  Traditionally, this dish is cooked with chicken, wedges of green papaya, and leaves of the siling labuyo chili pepper in broth flavored with ginger, onions and fish sauce. A common variant substitutes pork for chicken, chayote instead of papaya, or moringa leaves known as marungay or malunggay or kamunggay (in Cebuano), instead of pepper leaves.[tpl]cite web | title=Pork tinola| publisher=Home Cooking Rocks!| url=http://pinoycook.net/pork-tinola/ | accessdate=2010-06-05[/tpl]  However, an all-vegetable broth in Cebu with kamunggay in prominence is called utan kamunggay or utan bisayâ. Another variation is Tinolang Tahong, a soup made with mussels, ginger, onion, garlic and bird's eye chili.
The exact origins of Tinola is obscure. One of the earliest mentions of the dish is in José Rizal's first novel, Noli Me Tangere,where Kapitan Tiago served it to Crisostomo Ibarra upon arriving from Europe.He was given breasts,to dismay of the corrupt Spanish friar,Padre Damaso,who got chicken neck,the least favored chicken part.

His paintings have been displayed in more than 150 exhibitions during the past 20 years,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/want-some-pretty-things-to-look-at/Content?oid=1939786 |title=Want some pretty things to look at? | Visual Art | Cleveland Scene |publisher=Clevescene.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-07[/tpl] including thirty one-person shows in Cleveland, New York City, Phoenix, and Germany.  These exhibits have been reviewed in Art in America, New Art Examiner, the Washington Post, Dialogue, The Plain Dealer, and many other publications.  In 1987 he was awarded the grand prize for painting at the Cleveland Museum of Art’s May Show and has received Ohio Arts Council Fellowships in 1993, 1995 and 2001, and by the Artists Fellowship, Inc of New York in 2004.
As a writer he has been honored by the Cleveland Press Club and the Poets and Writers Guild of Greater Cleveland.  Utter is a founding editor of Angle Magazine / A Journal of Arts and Culture, and is currently managing editor of Artefakt Magazine. His critiques and essays on the arts have been published in New Art Examiner, (Chicago), Art Papers (Atlanta), Fiberarts, Ceramics Monthly, The Plain Dealer, Artefakt, Dialogue, Northern Ohio Live, CLE Magazine, and the Cleveland Free Times.
Utter was educated in part at Case-Western Reserve University and has taught painting and drawing courses at the University of Akron, Kent State University, and the Cleveland Institute of Art. He has two children: Christopher Benjamin Utter, born 2/9/84 and Elizabeth Anne Hyler, born 8/26/85.
About his recent exhibit "Asymptotes" he says:  In geometry, an asymptote is a line or curve that approaches, but never quite meets another line. Since the mid 1980’s many of my paintings have been about emotional commitment, and about the way that people touch or do not touch one another, physically and spiritually. Mainly I think intimacy is a matter of approximations; we do the best we can, but most often sympathy, for instance, can only approach empathy, unless it overshoots its goal and sinks in a welter of self-pity. In my experience it is very hard to lose oneself entirely, or give all of oneself, to a cause, or to another human being, or to the act of painting. Although most of these eighteen works on canvas deal with the situation of a single human presence, distorted by mood or circumstance, they are essentially about how hard, and how necessary, it is to try to touch. 
Recently, Utter has contributed to the upcoming book about friend and colleague Stephen Kasner. (Stephen Kasner WORKS: 1993 - 2006).[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

Count Grigory Kirillovich Razumovsky (November 10, 1759 – June 3, 1837) was a Ukrainian nobleman, political philosopher, botanist, zoologist and geologist known from his writings in the West as Gregor or Grégoire, who lost his Russian citizenship for openly criticizing the czarist system under emperor Alexander I, which he saw as pandering to the desires of a corrupt oligarchy of nobles. Gregor emigrated to western Europe, where was subsequently incorporated into the Bohemian nobility (Inkolat im Herrenstande) in 1811 and accorded the rank of count of the Austrian Empire. As a natural scientist, Gregor was the first to describe and classify Lissotrion helveticus. He was the fifth son of the last hetman of Ukraine, Kirill Grigorievich Razumovsky and brother of prince Andreas Razumovsky, he is also the ancestor of all living members of the family as such, the Russian lines having gone extinct by
He was the author of "Anecdotes et pensées philosophiques sur la Russie" (?) and of Observations Minéralogiques sur les environs de Vienne (1822).

Roche is a large crater on the far side of the Moon from the Earth. The prominent crater Pauli lies across the southern rim of Roche, and the outer rampart of Pauli covers a portion of Roche's interior floor. To the north-northwest of Roche is the crater Eötvös, and just to the west-northwest lies Rosseland.
The western rim of Roche has been somewhat distorted and straightened. The rim as a whole is worn and eroded, with multiple tiny craterlets marking the surface. The satellite crater Roche B lies across the northeastern inner wall.
The interior floor of Roche is relatively level, but is also marked by several small and tiny craterlets. A grouping of these craters lies near the midpoint. Just to the northwest of this grouping is a bright patch of high-albedo material. Sections of the floor along the north-northwestern side have a lower albedo than elsewhere, usually an indication of basaltic-lava flows similar to what fills the lunar maria. The extent of this patch may actually be larger, but covered with higher-albedo ejecta.

The  Muslim Brotherhood of Syria ([tpl]lang-ar|الإخوان المسلمون في سوريا[/tpl] Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimun fi Suriya) has been described as "a branch" of the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, and as "very loosely affiliated" to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The group's stated political positions are moderate and in its most recent April 2012 manifesto it "pledges to respect individual rights", to promote pluralism and democracy, and does not even "mention the word Islam".Khaled Yacoub Oweis "Syria's Muslim Brotherhood rise from the ashes," Reuters (6 May 2012)."Syria Muslim Brotherhood Issues Post-Assad State-for-All Commitment Charter," ikhwanweb.com (The Muslim Brotherhood's Official English web site) (7 April 2012).
Founded sometime before or at the end of World War II, the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria was seen as one of several important political parties in the 1950s. When Syria unified with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic, the disbanding of the Muslim Brotherhood as a political party was a condition of union, one complicated by Gamal Abdel Nasser's conflict in Egypt with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood was banned by the government of the Syrian Arab Republic starting after the 1963 coup by the secularist, pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party.Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press, 2008, p.241.

[[Mediated reference theory]]

CATEGORIES: Theories of language, Reference, Meaning (philosophy of language)

The mediated reference theory is a semantic theory that posits that words refer to something in the external world, but insists that there is more to the meaning of a name than simply the object to which it refers. It thus stands opposed to the theory of direct reference. Its most famous advocate is the mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege. The view was very widely held in the middle of the twentieth century by such philosophers as Sir Peter Strawson and John Searle.

The 10 Gigabit Ethernet Alliance (10GEA) was an independent (not directly related to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (EEE), although working in collaboration with it) organization which aimed to further 10 Gigabit Ethernet development and market acceptance. Founded in February 2000 by a consortium of companies, the organization provided IEEE with technology demonstrations (including, for instance, a May 7, 2002 demonstration in Las Vegas, in which a 200 plus kilometres 10Gb Ethernet network was deployed, using 10GBASE-LR, 10GBASE-ER, 10GBASE-SR and 10GBASE-LW ports, as well as presenting communication over the IEEE 802.3ae XAUI interface) and specifications. Its efforts bore fruit with the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Standards Board's approval in June 2002 of the IEEE 802.3 standard (formulated by the IEEE P802.3ae 10Gbit/s Ethernet Task Force).
The 10GEA was founded by 3Com, Cisco Systems, Extreme Networks, Intel Corporation, Nortel Networks, Sun Microsystems, and World Wide Packets.Other companies at various times supporting the consortium included: Agilent Technologies Inc., Blaze Network Products, Cable Design Technologies, Corning Inc., Enterasys Networks, Force10 Networks Inc., Foundry Networks Inc., Hitachi Cable Ltd, Infineon Technologies, Ixia, JDS Uniphase, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mindspeed, Molex Inc., OFS (part of Lucent), Optillion, PMC-Sierra, Primarion, Quake Technologies (acquired by Applied Micro Circuits Corporation), Spirent Communications, and Velio Communications (later acquired by LSI Corporation).

A direct reference theory, also called referentialism or referential realism,Andrea Bianchi (2012) Two ways of being a (direct) referentialist, in Joseph Almog, Paolo Leonardi Having in Mind: The Philosophy of Keith Donnellan p.79 or referential fallacy,p.96p.11 is a theory of language that claims that the meaning of a word or expression lies in what it points out in the world. The object denoted by a word is called its referent. Criticisms of this position are often associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein.Severin Schroeder (2006) Wittgenstein p.30 [tpl]quotation|This view that the meaning of a word has to be explained in terms of what it stands for, its reference, I shall call referentialism.[/tpl]
In the 19th century, mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege argued against it, and contrasted it with mediated reference theory.Emery J. Hyslop-Margison, Ayaz Naseem (2007) Scientism and Education: Empirical Research as Neo-Liberal Ideology pp.83-4 In 1953, with his Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein argued against referentialism, famously saying that "the meaning of a word is its use." Direct reference theory is a position typically associated with logical positivism and analytical philosophy. Logical positivist philosophers in particular have significantly devoted their efforts in countering positions on the like of Wittgenstein's, and they aim at creating a "perfectly descriptive language" purified from ambiguities and confusions.

[[Ullmann reaction]]

The Ullmann reaction or Ullmann coupling [ref]
</ref> is a [[coupling reaction]] between [[aryl]] [[halide]]s with [[copper]]. The reaction is named after [[Fritz Ullmann]], who derived it from a reaction developed by his wife, [[Irma Goldberg]].<ref>[tpl]cite book|last=Mary|first=Creese|title=Ladies in the Laboratory II|date=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc|location=PO Box 317 Oxford OX2 9RU, UK|isbn=2003020846|page=184[/tpl]</ref> <ref>
</ref>  
A typical example is the coupling of 2 o-chloronitrobenzene reactants to form 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl with a copper - bronze alloy.Reynold C. Fuson and E. A. Cleveland, "2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl", Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 3, 339. Online article
The traditional version of the Ullmann reaction requires harsh reaction conditions, and the reaction has a reputation for erratic yields. Since its discovery some improvements and alternative procedures have been introduced.
The reaction mechanism of the Ullmann reaction is extensively studied. Electron spin resonance rules out a radical intermediate. The oxidative addition / reductive elimination sequence observed with palladium catalysts is unlikely for copper because copper(III) is rarely observed. The reaction probably involves the formation of an organocopper compound (RCuX) which reacts with the other aryl reactant in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Alternative mechanisms do exist such as σ-bond metathesis.Derek van Allen, PhD Thesis, University of Massachusetts Amherst 2004. Electronic thesis 
The classical Ullmann reaction is limited to electron deficient aryl halides and requires harsh reaction conditions. Modern variants of the Ullman reaction employing palladium and nickel have widened the substrate scope of the reaction and rendered reaction conditions more mild. Yields are generally still moderate, however.Nelson, T. D.; Crouch, R. D. Org. React. 2004, 63, 265. [tpl]doi|10.1002/0471264180.or063.03[/tpl] In organic synthesis this reaction is often replaced by palladium coupling reactions such as the Heck reaction, the Hiyama coupling and the Sonogashira coupling.
In a variation of the Ullmann reaction, (2-bromovinyl)-benzene is reacted with imidazole in an ionic liquid, BMIMBF4*, to give N-(2-phenylvinyl)-imidazole.Zhiming Wang, Weiliang Bao and Yong Jiang, "L-Proline promoted Ullmann-type reaction of vinyl bromides with imidazoles in ionic liquids", Chemical Communications, 2005,  2849-51 Abstract The reaction requires (L)-proline catalysis.

LNCaP cells are a cell line of human cells commonly used in the field of oncology.

They are adherent epithelial cells growing in aggregates and as single cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Horoszewicz JS, Leong SS, Kawinski E, Karr JP, Rosenthal H, Chu TM, Mirand EA, Murphy GP| title = LNCaP model of human prostatic carcinoma | journal = Cancer Res | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 1809–18 |date=April 1983 | pmid = 6831420 | doi =  [/tpl]
One major obstacle to the conducting the most clinically relevant prostate cancer (PCa) research has been the lack of cell lines that closely mimic human disease progression. Two hallmarks of metastatic human prostate cancer include the shift of aggressive PCa from androgen-sensitivity to an Androgen Insensitive (AI) state, and the propensity of PCa to metastasize to bone. Although the generation of AI cell lines has been quite successful as  demonstrated in the “classic” cell lines DU145 and PC3, the behavior of these cells in bone does not fully mimic clinical human disease. It is well established that human PCa bone metastasis form osteoblastic lesions rather than osteolytic lesions seen in other cancers like breast cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Koeneman KS, Yeung F, Chung LW | title = Osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer cells: a hypothesis supporting the predilection of prostate cancer metastasis and growth in the bone environment | journal = Prostate | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 246–61 |date=June 1999 | pmid = 10344214 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(19990601)39:43.0.CO;2-U [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Lin DL, Tarnowski CP, Zhang J, Dai J, Rohn E, Patel AH, Morris MD, Keller ET | title = Bone metastatic LNCaP-derivative C4-2B prostate cancer cell line mineralizes in vitro | journal = Prostate | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–21 |date=May 2001 | pmid = 11351351 | doi = 10.1002/pros.1065 [/tpl] Similarly, PC-3 and DU145 cells form osteolytic tumors.

Porgy and Bess is a 1959 American musical film directed by Otto Preminger. It is based on the 1935 opera of the same name by George Gershwin, DuBose Heyward, and Ira Gershwin, which is in turn based on Heyward's  1925 novel Porgy, and the subsequent 1927 non-musical stage adaptation he co-wrote with his wife Dorothy. The screenplay for the film, which turned the operatic recitatives into spoken dialogue, was very closely based on the opera and was written by N. Richard Nash.
The project proved to be the last for Samuel Goldwyn, who had produced Wuthering Heights, The Best Years of Our Lives, and Guys and Dolls, among many others, during his lengthy career. Due to its controversial subject matter, the film was shown only briefly following its initial reserved seat engagements in major cities, where it drew mixed reviews from critics. Two months after its release, Goldwyn grudgingly conceded, "No one is waiting breathlessly for my next picture."Berg, A. Scott, Goldwyn: A Biography. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 1989.

As he began to tell a story about an ancient Egyptian ritual, he would stir the water with his bare hand, upon which it would turn black and opaque. As the story unfolded, he would then place a handful of each color of sand into the bowl of dark water, then extract them, one by one, dry and unmixed. Henning would then stir the water one last time, and it would again become completely clear, with a few stray grains of sand left in it.

She became the first female sportscaster in the Bay Area and quickly made a reputation for herself as someone who always got the big story and interviewed the top professional sports players despite being a woman. In 1981, she was recognized by Tampa Bay Metro Magazine as the Bay Area's best sports reporter. 
In an effort to curb declining ratings, WFLA promoted Sierens to coanchor of the 6 & 11 p.m. newscasts with Bob Hite in October 1985, a move that was criticized at first. The move later paid off as Sierens was regarded as being likeable and just as intuitive doing news as she did sports. In 1987, through a short stint with NBC Sports, she became the first (and as of 2011, still the only) woman to do play-by-play for an NFL regular season football game when she called the December 27 game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Kansas City Chiefs.
In 1984, she was honored with a Florida Emmy Award for sports reporting and in 1991, Sierens won her second Emmy for news reporting.
January 10, 2007 was designated as "Gayle Sierens Day" by Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio to commemorate Sierens' 30th year with the station, a rarity in television news.
Currently, she is on an advisory board for the Boy's and Girl's Clubs of Greater Tampa, serves as chairperson for the Big Brother's/Big Sister's annual "Bowl for Kids' Sake" fundraiser, and is a member of the board of directors of the Judeo-Christian Health Clinic.
She is married to Mike Martin, former linebacker for the Chicago Bears and the New England Patriots, who owns the Mike's Pies & Coffee Shoppe in Tampa.St. Pete Times - The upper crust

Scream Team was produced by Ben Devlin a London based producer with his MakingTime Productions. It was also shown on the now defunct British cable and satellite station ftn.
Shortly after the end of Scream Team, he was approached to join Living TV's flagship show Most Haunted (working alongside Yvette Fielding and Karl Beattie) in the role of paranormal investigator, and proved popular with fans in seasons 2 to 4 when he left the show to concentrate on other areas of the media.

In this book he introduces the reader to the different forms of paranormal activity that can be encouraged at a haunted site and provides a guide to conducting a paranormal investigation. The book covers everything from experiments to his own reports from investigations.
He is currently working on two fiction books, has a regular column in Chat It's Fate. In September 2010 Phil married fiancee Sara Woodward at a ceremony held at Comlongon Castle, Scotland.
Other interesting facts: From the East Midlands city of Nottingham, he is a keen musician, composing and performing synth-instrumental music. He was composer and keyboardist for the group Pesky.
At the time of his breakthrough with Scream Team he was working as a laptop engineer.
Phil Whyman launched Phil Whyman's Ghost Hunting Company in 2012.
Return to ''Most Haunted''
On 14 October 2009 it was announced that Phil was to rejoin Most Haunted Live! for its eight night show from Morecambe, Lancashire being aired Halloween week October 2009.
In January 2010, he was again involved in Most Haunted Live, from RAF West Raynham airforce base in Norfolk. Primarily his role is opposite presenter Paul Ross as a studio-based expert. However, each night when the show ends (midnight) Phil takes two audience members to participate in a vigil. This is then aired the following day on the show.
In October 2011 Whyman rejoined the Most Haunted team of Yvette Fielding, Karl Beattie, Cath Howe, Stuart Torevell and Capel's demonologist Fred Batt to film a Most Haunted Christmas Special called Most Haunted Christmas Spirits, that is to be released on DVD only in December 2011.
Phil now hosts a monthly podcast along with his wife Sara Whyman and friend Arron Weedall, The Dead Haunted Podcast is free and can be found on iTunes.

[[We're Not Afraid]]

CATEGORIES: British political websites, July 2005 London bombings

We're not Afraid! is a website which was created just hours after the 7 July 2005 London bombings as a place for Internet users from around the world to state that they were not being intimidated by the actions of the terrorists.
It grew rapidly and had over one thousand images as of August 2005, with more being added as they were emailed to the administrators.   Alfie Dennen founded the site initially as a small photoblog and did not expect it to become so large.  The site suffered problems due to over-use caused by media coverage http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1525741,00.htmlhttp://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/07/11/london.website/ in several British newspapers and on CNN
A statement dated 19 July 2007 posted on the site states that although the URL remains valid "unfortunately we simply do not have anyone who has the time to keep everything running and dynamic. We are pleased however that the site will remain online as a permanent reminder of the terrorist attacks here in London in 2005."
At one point, there was a parody site, We're shitting ourselves!, but it has since expired.

Suppressive Person, often abbreviated SP, is a term used in Scientology to describe the "antisocial personalities" who, according to Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard, make up about 2.5% of the population. A statement on a Church of Scientology website describes this group as including notorious historic figures such as Adolf Hitler.Reitman, Janet "Inside Scientology:Unlocking the complex code of America's most mysterious religion", Rolling Stone, February 2006 pg. 6
The term is often applied to those whom the Church of Scientology perceives as its enemies, i.e., those whose "disastrous" and "suppressive" acts are said to impede the progress of individual Scientologists or the Scientology movement.Paulick, James "Scientology Wins Court Battle in Germany",Deustche Welle, 28 April 2008  - According to Hubbard, "a Suppressive Person or Group is one that actively seeks to suppress or damage Scientology or a Scientologist by Suppressive Acts….A Suppressive Person or Group becomes 'fair game.'" - http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1567596,00.html Retrieved 7 October 2008
One of the reasons Scientology doctrines portray Suppressive Persons as such a danger is that they are supposed to make people around them become Potential Trouble Sources (abbreviated PTS).  Scientology defines a PTS as "a person who is in some way connected to and being adversely affected by a suppressive person. Such a person is called a potential trouble source because he can be a lot of trouble to himself and to others."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/feature/glossary/index.html#p |title=Church of Scientology Official Site |publisher=Scientology |accessdate=2009-11-22[/tpl] PTSs are said to make up 17.5% of the population.Sommer, Mark "Breaking In, Breaking Out", Buffalo News, 31 January 2005 - "A PTS is someone from among the 20 percent of the population that Hubbard declared was predisposed against Scientology."

He subsequently designed more than 668 different boats,[tpl]cite journal |date=July 2007 |journal=Messing About in Boats |volume=25 |issue=4 |page=28[/tpl] from a 114-foot-10-inch (35 m) replica of an eighteenth-century naval warship, the frigate Surprise (ex-Rose), to the 6-foot-5-inch (1.96 m) plywood box-like dinghy Tortoise.
Although his designs ranged through the full spectrum of boat types, Bolger tended to favor simplicity over complexity. Many of his hulls are made from sheet materials — typically plywood — and have hard chines. A subclass of these designed in association with Harold Payson called Instant Boats were so named because they were intended to be easily built by amateurs out of commonly available materials. Bolger also advocated the use of traditional sailing rigs and leeboards.
From the 1990s, Phil Bolger teamed with his wife Susanne Altenburger, designing boats under the name Phil Bolger & Friends Inc. During this time, they emphasized the design of sustainable and fuel-efficient boats for the fishing industry. Also, they participated in a large military commission with the Naval Sea Systems Command on new designs for military landing craft utility boats.
Bolger was a prolific writer and wrote many books, the last being Boats with an Open Mind, as well as hundreds of magazine articles on small craft designs, chiefly in Woodenboat, Small Boat Journal and Messing About in Boats.
Bolger died on May 24, 2009, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His wife explained that "his mind had slipped in the last several months, and he wanted to control the end of his life while he was still able."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/05/31/phil_bolger_noted_designer_of_boats_from_gloucester/?page=1 |first=Bryan |last=Marquard |title=Phil Bolger, Noted Designer of Boats from Gloucester |work=The Boston Globe |date=2009-05-31 |accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/us/01bolger.html |first=Bruce |last=Weber |title=Philip C.

Nancy Creek is a [tpl]convert|16.3|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl]U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 15, 2011 stream in northern Atlanta, Georgia, United States.  It begins in far northern DeKalb County, just north of Chamblee, and flows southwestward into Fulton County, through the far southeast corner of Sandy Springs, then through the Buckhead area of Atlanta.  It empties into Peachtree Creek, which then flows into the Chattahoochee River, south of Vinings and Paces.  The Chattahoochee eventually joins with the Flint River to create the Apalachicola River, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico.  The North Fork Nancy Creek is a major tributary, while Little Nancy Creek tends to run low or dry.
Since 1994, Nancy Creek has had a USGS stream gauge in the Paces neighborhood of Atlanta at West Wesley Road (NANG1, [tpl]coord|33|50|18|N|84|26|22|W[/tpl]), with NWS flood stage being [tpl]convert|12.0|ft|m[/tpl] at that point.

The (First) Peace of Thorn was a peace treaty formally ending the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War between allied Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania on one side, and the Teutonic Knights on the other. It was signed on 1 February 1411 in Thorn (Toruń), one of the southernmost cities of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights. In historiography, the treaty is often portrayed as a diplomatic failure of Poland–Lithuania as they failed to capitalize on the decisive defeat of the Knights in the Battle of Grunwald in June 1410. The Knights returned Dobrzyń Land which they captured from Poland during the war and made only temporary territorial concessions in Samogitia, which returned to Lithuania only for the lifetimes of Polish King Jogaila (Władysław Jagiełło) and Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas. The Peace of Thorn was not stable. It took two other brief wars, the Hunger War in 1414 and Gollub War in 1422, to sign the Treaty of Melno that solved the territorial disputes. However, large war reparations were a significant financial burden on the Knights, causing internal unrest and economic decline. The Teutonic Knights never recovered their former might.

[[Cataract of Lodore]]
CATEGORIES: Poetry by Robert Southey, Cumbria, English poetry

"The Cataract of Lodore" is a poem written in 1820 by the English poet Robert SoutheyGeorge Stillman Hillard Third class reader pg. 84 BiblioBazaar (2009) ISBN 1-103-57850-2 which describes the Lodore Falls on the Watendlath Beck just above Derwent Water in Cumbria, England. The poem is a masterpiece of onomatopoeia, employing some of the most clever and evocative language ever used to describe a natural feature. When seen in its entire form, the body of the poem does look like a waterfall.
The waterfall, a must for Victorian tourists staying at Keswick, is formed by the beck from Watendlath Tarn cascading over huge boulders for a distance of some 100 feet. The main drop of the falls is about 28 metres, or 90 feet. Although the falls are spectacular after periods of heavy rain, they dry to a trickle in periods of prolonged dry weather.
The Powell Expedition named the a canyon on the Green River in the U.S. state of Colorado the Gates of Lodore after this poem.

[[Plasma scaling]]

CATEGORIES: Plasma physics, Space plasmas

The parameters of plasmas, including their spatial and temporal extent, vary by many orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, there are significant similarities in the behaviors of apparently disparate plasmas. Understanding the scaling of plasma behavior is of more than theoretical value.  It allows the results of laboratory experiments to be applied to larger natural or artificial plasmas of interest. The situation is similar to testing aircraft or studying natural turbulent flow in wind tunnels with smaller-scale models.
Similarity transformations (also called similarity laws) help us work out how plasma properties change in order to retain the same characteristics. A necessary first step is to express the laws governing the system in a nondimensional form. The choice of nondimensional parameters is never unique, and it is usually only possible to achieve by choosing to ignore certain aspects of the system.
One dimensionless parameter characterizing a plasma is the ratio of ion to electron mass. Since this number is large, at least 1836, it is commonly taken to be infinite in theoretical analyses, that is, either the electrons are assumed to be massless or the ions are assumed to be infinitely massive. In numerical studies the opposite problem often appears. The computation time would be intractably large if a realistic mass ratio were used, so an artificially small but still rather large value, for example 100, is substituted. To analyze some phenomena, such as lower hybrid oscillations, it is essential to use the proper value.

Jean Théodore Delacour (26 September 1890 – 5 November 1985) was an American ornithologist of French origin. He was renowned for not only discovering but also rearing some of the rarest birds in the world.  One of the birds he discovered was the Imperial Pheasant, later found to be a hybrid between the Vietnamese Pheasant and the Silver Pheasant.
Delacour was born in Paris into a wealthy family and grew up on the family estate in Picardy where he became interested in aviculture and established a private zoo. He attended good schools and achieved a doctorate in biology from the Université Lille Nord de France.  He served in the French Army during the First World War, a war which devastated the family estate, as well as killing his only surviving brother.  Moving to Chateau Clères in Normandy, he created a second zoo, eventually donating it to the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in 1967.  He went on numerous scientific expeditions to Indochina, particularly Vietnam, as well as to Venezuela, the Guianas and Madagascar.
During the Second World War Delacour lived in the USA, working as a technical adviser for the New York Zoological Society (now known as the Wildlife Conservation Society) as well as on avian systematics at the American Museum of Natural History.  In 1952 he became director of the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science and Art, retiring in 1960.  Thereafter he divided his time seasonally, spending summer at his estate at Clères in France, and wintering in the United States, mainly in Los Angeles.

Fritz Ullmann (July 2, 1875, Fürth – March 17, 1939, Berlin) was a German chemist.
Ullmann was born in Fürth and started studying chemistry in Nuremberg, but received his PhD of the University of Geneva for work with Carl Gräbe in 1895. After some time in Geneva he went to Berlin in 1905.
Ullmann taught technical chemistry during 1905-1913 and 1922-1925 at the Technischen Hochschule Berlin now Technische Universität Berlin, first as part of the ordinary teaching staff, later on as a professor. 
In 1900 he introduced dimethyl sulfate as an alkylating agent. Between 1914 and 1922, when he was back in Geneva, he published the first edition of the "Enzyklopädie der Technischen Chemie" in 12 volumes (ISBN 3-527-20142-4) in English the Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, a publication that exists to this day. He was married to Irma Goldberg who was his assistant from 1905 to 1910 at his laboratory.
They named after themselves the following reactions: the Ullmann reaction, the Ullmann condensation, the Graebe-Ullmann synthesis, the Goldberg reaction and the illustrious Jordan-Ullmann-Goldberg synthesis.

[[Peachtree Creek]]

CATEGORIES: ACF River Basin, Chattahoochee River, Geography of DeKalb County, Georgia, Geography of Fulton County, Georgia, Geography of Atlanta, Georgia, Rivers of Georgia (U.S. state)

Peachtree Creek is a major stream in Atlanta.  It flows for [tpl]convert|7.5|mi[/tpl]U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 15, 2011 almost due west into the Chattahoochee River just south of Vinings.  Like other "Peachtree" names in the area, the name is most likely a corruption of "pitch tree", from the area's many pines and their sticky sap.
Peachtree Creek is an important part of the area history.  Fort Peachtree was built near the creek and the Chattahoochee River to guard against the Cherokee, who were in the Cherokee County territory northwest of the river.  During the American Civil War, the Battle of Peachtree Creek was a major battle of the Atlanta Campaign.  Pace's Ferry was built across the river near the creek, and Paces Ferry Road still runs roughly parallel to the creek.  Another street, Peachtree Battle Avenue, runs in a similar fashion.  Because it is usually called just Peachtree Battle (even by GDOT on its overpass of Interstate 75), that part of Buckhead is often called the same, which in turn gave rise to a local play called Peachtree Battle.
Its two major tributaries are the North Fork Peachtree Creek and the South Fork Peachtree Creek.  The northern fork begins at the edge of Gwinnett County and flows [tpl]convert|13.5|mi[/tpl] southwest, almost perfectly parallel to Interstate 85 through DeKalb County.  It ends at its confluence with the southern fork, next to where the highway meets Georgia 400.  The southern fork, [tpl]convert|15.4|mi[/tpl] long, begins in Tucker and flows south then west, passing through Clarkston, then crossing under part of the Stone Mountain Freeway and quickly back again, west (inside) of the Perimeter.  It then flows twice through the northern part of the campus of Emory University and its Wesley Woods section.  The southern edge of its basin borders the Eastern Continental Divide, including Peavine Creek (which ends next to WAGA-TV) and its tributary Lullwater Creek, which originates in the Lake Claire neighborhood of Atlanta and drains Fernbank Forest and the Druid Hills Golf Club north of Ponce de Leon Avenue. Other major nearby creeks in Atlanta include Nancy Creek (which flows into Peachtree Creek just before the Chattahoochee River), and Proctor Creek (which flows directly into the Chattahoochee).

The Herrin Massacre took place in June 1922 in Herrin, Illinois. Following an early morning gunfire attack on non-union miners going to work on June 21, three union miners (Jordie Henderson, Joseph Pitkewicius and one other) were killed in a confrontation after the striking union members marched on the mine. The next day, union miners killed 19 of fifty strikebreakers and mine guards, many of them in brutal ways. A twentieth victim from the non-union group would later be murdered, bringing the death total to twenty-three.Paul M.

The Yemtsa or Yomtsa ([tpl]lang-ru|Емца[/tpl]) is a river in Plesetsky and Kholmogorsky Districts and in the town of Mirny of Arkhangelsk Oblast in Russia. It is a left tributary of the Northern Dvina River. It is [tpl]convert|188|km|mi[/tpl] long, and the area of its basin [tpl]convert|14100|km2|sqmi[/tpl].  Its main tributaries are the Mekhrenga (right), the Tyogra (left), the Vaymuga (left), and the Bolshaya Chacha (right).
The river basin of the Yemtsa occupies the east of the Plesetsky District, the south of the Kholmogorsky District, and some areas in the norther parts of the Nyandomsky and Shenkursky Districts. In addition, the territory subordinate to the town of Mirny lies entirely within the limits of the river basin of the Yemtsa. In the low course, the Yemtsa bounds from the south the Siysky Zakaznik, a federal nature protected area.
The source of the Yemtsa is in Plesetsky District, north-west of the settlement of Plesetsk and several kilometers east of the Onega River (which does not belong to the Northern Dvina basin). The Yemtsa flows to north-east. The urban-type settlement of Savinsky is located on the right bank of the river. Note that the urban-type settlement and the railway station of Yemtsa is not located on the river. Downstream from Savinsky, the Yemtsa crosses into the territory of the town of Mirny, and from there into Kholmogorsky District, where it accepts from the right its biggest tributary, the Mekhrenga. Close to the mouth, the historical selo of Yemetsk, a former uyezd and district center, is located on the left bank. 
The lower [tpl]convert|10|km|mi[/tpl] of the river course (downstream from the selo of Yemetsk) are navigable.

[[Sipán]]
CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in Peru, Moche culture

Sipán is a Moche archaeological site in northern Peru that is famous for the tomb of El Señor de Sipán (Lord of Sipán), excavated by Walter Alva and his wife Susana Meneses beginning in 1987. The tomb of the Lord of Sipan has been dated to around 100 AD. The site, where fourteen tombs have been discovered, is considered to be one of the most important archaeological discoveries in the last 30 years, because the main tomb was found intact and undisturbed by thieves. Tombs have been found also in Sipán's Huaca Rajada, an area near Chiclayo. Many huaca have been found that contain burial goods of Moche jewelry, masks, and art. 
The tombs in the area are of adobe construction, of pyramidal shape, now eroded by successive El Niño events.  Excavations continue. A mock-up of the Lord of Sipan's tomb, complete with replica head-dress, breastplates and other grave goods, is open to visitors at the museum devoted to this site, which was opened in 2002. A reconstruction of the Lord of Sipan in his regalia is displayed in the Archaeological Museum of Lima, Peru.
It is believed that the people placed grave goods, including the remains of servants, to ensure survival of the elite into the afterlife. Also discovered were hundreds of small clay pots with individual faces, understood to be offerings made by the lord's subjects.
Several dozens of such Moche tombs likely existed at one time, but almost all known tombs on the coast of Peru have been looted.  This looting has occurred since at least the Spanish colonial period. Documented colonial mining laws stipulated how "looting rights" were to be determined.
In modern times, the government has declared looting illegal, although it is still widely practiced. The archaeological sites are so numerous that law enforcement numbers are often insufficient to protect them.

In thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, stagnation temperature is the temperature at a stagnation point in a fluid flow. At a stagnation point the speed of the fluid is zero and all of the kinetic energy has been converted to internal energy (adiabatically) and is added to the local static enthalpy. In incompressible fluid flow, and in isentropic compressible flow, the stagnation temperature is equal to the total temperature at all points on the streamline leading to the stagnation point.

Quebec lawyer Casper Bloom, chairman of the committee, and Liberal MNA Lawrence Bergman worked together to "make all eligible voters outside Quebec aware of their rights, to have them register and finally vote" said the pamphlet.
Since 1989, a clause of the Quebec electoral law allows for ex-residents of Quebec to signal, in writing, their intention of returning to Quebec and vote by mail. The Committee, which operated during the referendum campaign, handed-out pamphlets including the  form to be added to the list of voters by the Directeur général des élections du Québec. 
The pamphlet gave out a toll-free number as contact information which was the same number as the one used by the Canadian Unity Council.

The Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Stairs, also known as the Stairway to Heaven or Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Ladder, is a steep hiking trail on the island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://friendsofhaikustairs.org/ |title=THE FRIENDS OF HAIKU STAIRS (archive.org) |publisher=Friendsofhaikustairs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080420111816/http://friendsofhaikustairs.org/ |archivedate = 2008-04-20[/tpl]
The trail began as a wooden ladder spiked to the cliff on the south side of the Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Valley.  It was installed in 1942 to enable  antenna cables to be strung from one side of the cliffs above Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Valley to the other.  A building to provide a continuous communication link between Wahiawā and Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū Valley Naval Radio Station was constructed at the peak of Pu[tpl]okina[/tpl]ukeahiakahoe, elevation about [tpl]convert|2800|ft|m[/tpl]. The antennae transmitted very low frequency radio signals from a 200,000-watt Alexanderson alternator in the center of Ha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikū valley.  The signals could reach US Navy submarines as far away as Tokyo Bay while the submarines were submerged.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.haikuvalley.com/History/HIGH-SCALERS-OF-HAIKUBILL/2043841_ADiaP#110678032_jzzCn |last=Woodbury |first=David |title=High Scalers of Haiku |newspaper=Denver Post |year=1950 |quote=Thousands of lives, millions of dollars' worth of equipment hinged on the audacity of Bill Adams and Louis Otto |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Woodbury |first=David |title=Builders for Battle |chapter=Fighting Men on a Flying Trapeze |pages=353–370 |publisher=E.

When the Naval base was decommissioned in the 1950s, the United States Coast Guard used the site for an Omega Navigation System station.  In the mid-1950s, the wooden stairs were replaced by sections of metal steps and ramps — by one count, 3,922 steps.  The station and trail were closed to the public in 1987. Some hikers ignore the No Trespassing signs and continue to climb, contributing to the local community's misgivings about reopening the structure.
In 2003, the stairs were repaired, costing the city $875,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/attractions/stairwaytoheaven.php |title=Stairway to Heaven, Oahu |publisher=To-hawaii.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] As of early 2012, land usage rights issues have not been resolved. The City and County of Honolulu has stated that there is currently no plan to open the stairs for public use, citing liability concerns. Dozens of people, however, routinely hike up the stairs every day. As recently as early December, 2013, a guard had been posted at the base of the stairs; however, the guard frequently had not been there in the early months of 2014 and a small tent which had been erected for the guard to use had been dismantled in early February, 2014. As of early April 2014, the guard has been posted but didn't seem too concerned with stopping any hikers.

Skipping Towards Gomorrah: The Seven Deadly Sins and the Pursuit of Happiness in America is a non-fiction book by Dan Savage, first published in 2002 by Dutton. The book examines the concept of happiness in American culture, as obtained by indulging in each of the Seven Deadly Sins.
Skipping Towards Gomorrah was selected for inclusion in The Best American Sex Writing 2004, and won a Lambda Literary Award in 2003. The book received a favorable reception from reviews in Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, and Kirkus Reviews. A review in Flagpole Magazine was critical of the book's organization, and observed that the writing wandered a bit, while a review in Gay Today commented, "Those who agree with Savage's views will like his book while those who disagree will hate it; in either case there will be no converts."

CATEGORIES: Fluid dynamics

In fluid dynamics, a stagnation point is a point in a flow field where the local velocity of the fluid is zero.Clancy, L.J. Aerodynamics, Section 3.2 Stagnation points exist at the surface of objects in the flow field, where the fluid is brought to rest by the object. The Bernoulli equation shows that the static pressure is highest when the velocity is zero and hence static pressure is at its maximum value at stagnation points. This static pressure is called the stagnation pressure.[tpl]cite book |last=Fox |first=R. W. |authorlink= |coauthors=McDonald, A. T. |title=Introduction to Fluid Mechanics |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley | edition = 4th |location= |isbn=0-471-20231-2[/tpl]Clancy, L.J. Aerodynamics, Section 3.5
The Bernoulli equation applicable to incompressible flow shows that the stagnation pressure is equal to the dynamic pressure plus static pressure.  Total pressure is also equal to dynamic pressure plus static pressure so, in incompressible flows, stagnation pressure is equal to total pressure.    (In compressible flows, stagnation pressure is also equal to total pressure providing the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically.)Clancy, L.J.

[[Maya River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of the Sakha Republic

Maya River ([tpl]lang-ru|Майя[/tpl], or Мая) is a river in Khabarovsk Krai and Sakha, Russia. It is a right tributary of the Aldan River of the Lena basin. The length of the river is 1053 km. The area of its basin 171,000 km². The Maya River freezes up in late October and stays under the ice until May. The Yudoma River is one of the biggest tributaries of the Maya. The river is navigable within 500 km from its mouth.
The Maya was part of the river route from Yakutsk to the Okhotsk Coast.  Its course is approximately "V"-shaped. The upper Maya runs about 125 miles southwest parallel to the coast between the Dzhugdzhur Mountains and the Yudoma Plateau. About 50 miles from its source the Mati River comes in from the south. From the Mati either the Lama Portage or the Alanchak Portage led to the Ulya River and the coast. Near the southernmost point was the settlement of Nelkan from which a track led over the mountains to Ayan. The Maya flows west for perhaps 40 miles and receives the Maimakan River from the southwest. From here the river flows basically north about 200 miles, receives the Yudoma River from the east and joins the Aldan River at Ust-Maya. From Ust-Maya there was a horse-track to Yakutsk. Eastbound boats that reached Ust-Maya from the Lena River were replaced by smaller boats to continue up the Maya.

Big Blue Disk was a monthly disk magazine that was published by Softdisk Publishing starting in 1986, getting its name from the nickname for IBM, "Big Blue".  It carried various games and applications for DOS as well as reviews and various extras.  Some of them were freeware or shareware, or demo versions of commercial programs, but other material was original to the disk magazine.  When it began, it was published on 5¼" floppy diskettes, but it was later published on 3½" disks and CD-ROMs.  Sometimes, but not always, the disks were actually blue as the title implied.  Notably, it carried some games from Apogee, including Kingdom of Kroz and its sequels.  In 1991, on issue #57 it was later changed to On Disk Monthly and then again renamed to Softdisk PC on issue #91.  The series ceased publication in 1998.  Softdisk for Windows was a spinoff publication for the Microsoft Windows operating system which outlasted it by a year.  Other short-lived spinoff publications included the business-oriented PC BusinessDisk and the recreational Gamer's Edge, the latter of which had on its original staff the people who soon founded id Software.  There was also briefly a separate version for users with CGA and EGA graphics adapters, when the main publication (formerly compatible with CGA and even text-only MDA monochrome systems) moved to a graphical interface that required VGA graphics.
Publishing rights in some countries were licensed by Softdisk to other companies, which released adapted versions including PC Disk Downunder in Australia and New Zealand, and El Usuario in Latin America.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1927 to 1936.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/hansard/members/mla_bio_deceased.html#C0 |title=MLA Biographies - Deceased |work=Legislative Assembly of Manitoba[/tpl]
Curran was born in Emerson, Manitoba, the son of Robert Curran and Lucy Robinson, and was educated at public schools in the region.  He worked as a farmer, and served as president of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) local. In 1908, Curran married Annie Copeland. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature as a UFM candidate in the 1922 provincial election,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/curran_rf.shtml |title=Robert Franklin Curran (1883-1958) |work=Memorable Manitobans |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl] but finished third against independent candidate Dmytro Yakimischak in the Emerson constituency.
The UFM won the 1922 election, and governed as the Progressive Party.  Curran campaigned as a government candidate in the 1927 election, identifying himself as a Liberal-Progressive.  He was elected in a field of six candidates, with Yakimischak falling to fourth place. Curran served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's government in the parliament which followed.
In 1932, the Progressive Party forged a formal alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party, and all government members became known as Liberal-Progressives.  Curran ran under this banner again in the 1932 provincial campaign, and defeated his Conservative opponent by 245 votes.
He was defeated in the 1936 election, losing to Independent Liberal Herbert Wright by only twenty votes.

[[Seditious libel]]
CATEGORIES: Sedition, English law

Sedition and seditious libel weresection 73, Coroners and Justice Act 2009 criminal offences under English common law, but are still criminal offences in Canada,Sections 59 to 61 of the Criminal Code of Canada where common law tradition yet persists. Sedition is overt conduct, such as speech and organization, that is deemed by the legal authority to tend toward insurrection against the established order: if the statement is in writing or some other permanent form it is seditious libel.  Libel denotes a printed form of communication such as writing or drawing.L.L. Edwards, J.S. Edwards, P.K. Wells, Tort Law for Legal Assistants, Cengage Learning, 2008, p. 390. "Libel refers to written defamatory statements; slander refers to oral statements. Libel encompasses communications occurring in 'physical form'... defamatory statements on records and computer tapes are considered libel..."
A statement is seditious if it "brings into hatred or contempt" either the  Queen or her heirs, the government and constitution, either House of Parliament, the administration of justice, if it incites people to attempt to change any matter of Church or State established by law (except by lawful means), or if it promotes discontent among or hostility between British subjects. A person is only guilty of the offence if they have printed words or images and intend any of the above outcomes. Proving that the statement is true is not a defence. 
The common law offence was punishable in the UK with life imprisonment, and seems to have been replaced by the Terrorism Act 2000,"Islam4UK Islamist group banned under terror laws" 12 Jan 2010 bbc.co.uk where the act proscribes "threat of action... designed... to intimidate the public or a section of the public".  As of 2014, violation of section 59 of the Criminal Code of Canada attracted a maximum term in prison of 14 years, and the broader sedition was defined in part as follows: 
 
 59(4) Without limiting the generality of the meaning of the expression “seditious intention”, every one shall be presumed to have a seditious intention who
        (a) teaches or advocates, or
        (b) publishes or circulates any writing that advocates,
    the use, without the authority of law, of force as a means of accomplishing a governmental change within Canada.

so that the simple communication of seditious intent would in theory be sufficient grounds on which to convict.  
The American scholar, Leonard W. Levy, argues that seditious libel "has always been an accordion-like concept, expandable or contractible at the whim of judges."Levy, Leonard W. (1985) Emergence of a Free Press. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.8.

CATEGORIES: Districts of the House of Representatives of Japan, Japanese general elections

[tpl]Politics of Japan[/tpl][tpl]As of|2005[/tpl], the House of Representatives of Japan is elected from a combination of multi-member districts and single-member districts. Currently, 180 members are elected from 11 multi-member districts, and 300 members are elected from single-member districts, for a total of 480. These districts are those used for the 2003 general election.
Each Block (multi-member) district spans one or more Prefectures, and each Prefecture spans one or more single-member district, so the districts are organized by Block district and then by Prefecture. In general, the Block districts correspond loosely to the major Regions of Japan, with some of the larger regions subdivided.
Up to the 1993 general election all members of the House of Representatives were elected in multi-member constituencies by Single Non-Transferable Vote. In 1994, parliament passed an electoral reform bill that introduced the current system of parallel voting in single-member constituencies and proportional voting blocks.[tpl]cite news|title=Japanese Pass Bills On Electoral Reform|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E3DF173EF930A35752C1A962958260|work=The New York Times|date=3 November 1993|accessdate=2008-08-09[/tpl] The original draft bill in 1993 by the anti-LDP coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa included proportional party list voting on a national scale, an equal number of proportional and district seats (250 each) and the possibility of split voting. But the bill was stalled in the House of Councillors.CRS: Issue Brief IB93100 in the Government Document Digital Collection of the University of North Texas After the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had returned to power later that year, it was changed to include proportional voting in regional blocks only, the number of proportional seats was reduced, but the possibility to cast two separate votes was kept in the bill. The electoral reform law was finally passed in 1994. It was first applied in the 1996 general election.

The WOW franchise represents the most successful collections of Christian music ever issued.
Released in late 1995, "WOW 1996" was the first in the WOW series and the first recording put together by the three major Christian record companies of the time: Word Records (now Word Entertainment), Sparrow Records (now part of EMI Christian Music Group), and Reunion Records (now part of Sony's Provident Label Group).  Still today, after each submitting label agrees to a reduced master royalty, the final decision on the tracks to be included is made by committee.  Production, marketing, and distribution for the "WOW Hits" series is handled by EMI Christian Music Group.
Comprising songs submitted by each partner label, the annual "WOW Hits" releases have typically been double CD sets.  Beginning in 2008, however, "WOW" began releasing separate single-disc collections spread throughout each year, rather than a two-disc collection toward the end of each year.  In addition to "WOW Hits," which focuses on the most popular pop and pop-rock music, plans call for edgier single-disc "WOW Rock Hits" and "WOW Pop Hits" collections released twice a year.

The Swedish Bikini Team was a group of American female models who appeared in an advertising campaign for Old Milwaukee beer. These commercials ran for several months in 1991 in the United States, playing with American stereotypes of Scandinavian women being blonde and having big breasts. The premise of the commercials was that a group of bored or thirsty men were "saved" by the Swedish Bikini Team. Other commercials would focus on a group of men male bonding on a hunting trip and saying "Guys, it does not get any better than this", to which a narrator would say the man was wrong and an Old Milwaukee truck would drive miles off road towards them claiming "it improved", "..and when the Swedish Bikini Team showed up, it got somewhat better."
While many[tpl]quantify|date=April 2013[/tpl] viewers saw the ads as a parody of traditional beer advertisements, some[tpl]which|date=April 2013[/tpl] feminists found the ads misogynistic. Though the campaign generated widespread interest, the advertisements were dropped after protests by the National Organization for Women and female employees of the Pabst Brewing Company.[tpl]cite book|title=Adcult USA: The Triumph of Advertising in American Culture|last=Twitchell|first=James B|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1996|page=758|isbn= 0-231-10325-5[/tpl]

Belfield Park was a sports venue in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Ireland which was the home ground of University College Dublin A.F.C. from 1930 until 2007. It was previously a walled garden of Belfield House.
The ground was officially opened in August 1971 as Shamrock Rovers defeated a Mick Meagan XI

It had capacity for 2,500 people, including 1,448 seats. It was located on the western edge of the Belfield campus off Foster's Avenue. The main stand was the covered AIB Stand, while the Foster's Avenue End, which had been closed for 2 seasons because the wooden floorboards were unsafe in wet weather, was re-opened for the 2007 League of Ireland season with the bucket seats from the old Lansdowne Road stadium. 
The stadium played host to under-age Ireland international matches and senior international training sessions on occasion as well as hosting some games in the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship. Shamrock Rovers and Dublin City FC also played FAI League Cup games against UCD at Belfield Park. 
300 extra seats were temporarily added for the 2005 League Cup final against Derry City, which, together with the opening of the hill, increased capacity to 2,500.
UCD left Belfield Park after the 2007 season as plans for a ground share with the rugby team in the UCD Bowl came to fruition. The move was expected to take place as early as October 2007 but did not happen until the start of the 2008 eircom League season.

[[Employee pricing]]

CATEGORIES: Advertising techniques, Vehicle retailers, Automotive industry

Employee pricing is a selling strategy launched in 2005 by the auto industry in order to attract customers by using the discounted prices that auto industry employees pay for new cars rather than the sticker price MSRP. The program was first offered that year by General Motors, and later followed by Ford, Chrysler, and some local dealerships. While 2005 was the biggest year for the promotion, it has since been used several times, like during the automotive industry crisis of 2008 to stimulate sales.
Chrysler was the most notable of all during this promotion, with its "Employee Pricing Plus". Characterized by generous incentives combined with rebates on most Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep models, Chrysler claims their offer bests those "employee discount" prices offered by General Motors or Ford Motor Company.
Lee Iacocca is the celebrity spokesman for the campaign; he appears in summer 2005 ads with Jason Alexander, Snoop Dogg, and his granddaughter.
According to its TV ads and website, the world's first employee pricing program for customers was instituted by The Brick, a Canadian furniture store.
Starting on July 1, 2006, Chrysler reinstituted the Employee Pricing Plus program to run from July 1 to July 31. For the first five days of the program, all Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep dealerships in the United States were open until midnight to support the program, a first in the company's history. 
The discounted prices however do not impact profits much, as the margins are recovered with higher sales and better contribution to fixed costs.
Chrysler reinstated employee pricing price starting January 26th, 2009.

There is much infrastructure in the village including the town hall of the Vamos municipality that covers several other villages, a large medical centre, the court and the high school for the region, and several restaurants, snack bars and shops, largely serving the local community.
Below the modern town square at the top of the hill is old Vamos. Here a group of locals set up Vamos SA, an enterprise devoted to preserving local buildings and customs and attracting a sustainable form of tourism. Several of the old houses have been rebuilt as tourist accommodation. There is a well-regarded taverna – the Cistern of the Bloumosifi – as well as an art gallery, a café and a general store selling local products.
Vamos' population is estimated at 600.

[[Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Brooklyn]]

CATEGORIES: Churches in Brooklyn, Roman Catholic churches in New York, Basilica churches in the United States, Redemptorist churches, Sunset Park, Brooklyn

The Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help is an architectural landmark in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is located on 5th Avenue between 59th and 60th streets in the Sunset Park neighborhood and occupies about half the square block extending back to 6th Avenue, with the rectory and ancillary buildings occupying the remainder. The Basilica is visible for some distance, particularly from the Gowanus Expressway. It is popularly referred to by its initials, OLPH.
The basilica, founded and still staffed by the Redemptorists, is a Roman Catholic parish church of the Diocese of Brooklyn. It is dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and serves as a pro-cathedral. The architect was Franz Joseph Untersee of Boston MA. As a double church, the basilica has two floors of worship, like the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi. The upstairs church was commonly only used to host weddings and special group services such as confirmation and communion, but has come back into more frequent use. For many years, mass in Spanish was held upstairs because of the large number of parishioners in attendance. The lower level is for smaller services. The first floor has been renovated many times in recent years. Its new modernized look is more inviting and welcoming to parishioners. 
Because of its size, the Basilica hosts major diocesan services (e.g., ordinations)Ordination of Bishops dioceseofbrooklyn.org that would otherwise be held at Brooklyn's other, considerably smaller basilica, the Cathedral Basilica of St. James. For the same reason, it also hosts sadder events; it is a venue-of-choice for the larger funerals of those who have fallen in the line of duty while in the service of the New York City Police Department and the New York City Fire Department.
At the time of its completion, the parish was largely Irish in character (as evidenced by the inscriptions on the memorial windows). It was built on what was known as Irish Hill. Some of the family names include Collins, Brennan, Wade, Connors, Burns, McCaffrey, Healy, and Coffey. There is still an Irish presence, but today it is predominantly Hispanic and Chinese. The Basilica enjoys large attendance, particularly on holidays such as Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday and Christmas.  
The parish has an elementary school down the block on 6th Avenue and 59th and 60th Street. The elementary school celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2003. From 1956 until 1999 there was an OLPH Commercial High School for girls. Students at both were taught by the Sisters of St. Joseph, whose convent is on 59th Street and 6th Avenue. A rectory for the Redemptorist priests is on 59th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. 
The Basilica is served by the New York City Subway Fourth Avenue line 59th Street subway station (N and R Lines).
Chuck Connors, of The Rifleman, grew up in the neighborhood and served as an altar boy at OLPH.

CATEGORIES: 1870 births, 1952 deaths, Progressive Party of Manitoba MLAs, Road accident deaths in Canada, Accidental deaths in Manitoba, Pedestrian road accident victims, English emigrants to Canada

Thomas Wolstenholme (April 6, 1870—November 16, 1952) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.  He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1936.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/hansard/members/mla_bio_deceased.html#W0 |title=MLA Biographies - Deceased |work=Legislative Assembly of Manitoba[/tpl]
Wolstenholme was born and educated in Manchester, England, the son of Henry Wolstenholme and Mary Leech, and came to Canada in 1889.  He was a director and shareholder of the Moline Cooperative Society, and served as reeve of the Rural Municipality of Saskatchewan in Manitoba from 1918 to 1922.
He first campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the 1922 provincial election, as a candidate of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) in Hamiota.  He was successful, defeating Liberal incumbent John Henry McConnell by 403 votes.  The UFM unexpectedly won a majority of seats, and formed government as the Progressive Party.  Wolstenholme served in the legislature as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's administration.  He was re-elected without difficulty in the elections of 1927 and 1932.  He did not seek re-election in 1936.
Before the 1932 election, the governing Progressives formed an electoral alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party.  Government members, including Wolstenholme, were known as "Liberal-Progressives" after this time.
Wolstenholme was struck by a car on November 14, 1952, and died of his injuries at the Minnedosa General Hospital two days later.  His death was ruled an accident.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/wolstenholme_t.shtml |title=Thomas Wolstenholme (1870-1952) |work=Memorable Manitobans |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=2013-02-02[/tpl]

[[Ultimate Soldier]]
CATEGORIES: Action figures, Playscale figures

The Ultimate Soldier was produced by the company known as 21st Century Toys. It was founded in 1997, and began making 1/6 scale figures and uniforms, and now mostly makes 1/6 scale weapon sets as well as 1/18 and 1/32 scale toys. The action figures are based on World War Two, Vietnam War, Korean War, and Operation Desert Storm soldiers.
In 1997, 21st Century Toys decided to create a "12" inch soldier with more detailed accessories than Hasbro's G.I. Joe.  The original SAM action figures released featured the same basic movable joint design as the G.I. Joe Classic Collection action figures featuring 15 movable parts. They were slightly taller with a slimmer build, and made with flexible plastic. The hands were a main concern, because they were stiff and difficult to place accessories into, as well as having an unrealistic head sculpt with a baby-face like design. In 1999, the company released the Super Soldier body design with 27 movable parts. The expanded line included three new categories: The original Ultimate Soldier line included a Vietnam Veterans Memorial set of The Three Soldiers, a Spetsnaz soldier and sniper, a Navy SEAL, George S. Patton, Erwin Rommel  and various other modern day soldiers. The America's Finest line included Steve McQueen, firefighters, and a K-9 police officer. The Villains line included Boris; a KGB enforcer agent, a bounty Hunter named T-Gore, and a biker. The Misfits line included Jerry Only and Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein from the band the Misfits. A United States Secret Service agent was being considered when it was mentioned in a fan club] news letter; unfortunately this led to an unknown rival toy company producing it before 21st Century toys made their final decision about releasing it. This basic design was used in 2000 to create the Cy Girls known as the Perfect Body Female .
The arms had four parts, featuring fore arms, elbow pieces, lower biceps joints, and upper biceps/shoulder joints. The legs also had four parts with movable hips, calves, thighs and knee caps. The torso consisted of a movable chestpiece, abdomen and a pelvic piece connected by screws and springs. The head consisted of a pivoting neck joint (also connected by a spring and screw) with a universal socket joint for the rubber molded head to connect to. The new head sculpt was much more realistic. The double-jointed elbows and knees enabled the arms and legs to be posed into folded positions. This action figure could be posed into the lotus position and any other position that the human body was capable of (and several it was not capable of). The two main concerns were the following: the flap sections on the calves and thigh connecting to the knee caps would have gaps in between them, and the connecting joints created a loose fit.  The pivot joint connecting the neck to the torso was also very loose fitting, so that if it were accidentally knocked out of place or removed, there was no known way to put it back on. There were also complaints about the Nazi soldiers from the Third Reich being on the shelves. In 2002 the "12" inch line was cancelled as companies such as Dragon Models, Blue Box (BBI), Sideshow Collectibles, In the Past Toys and various other rival companies released their products with the same basic body design and their more detailed accessories. 21st Century Toys has moved on to producing smaller palm-sized planes, tanks and action figures.

[[Assise sur la ligece]]
CATEGORIES: Feudalism in the Kingdom of Jerusalem

thumb|right|125px|Coat of arms of the kingdom of Jerusalem.The Assise sur la ligece (roughly, "Assize on liege-homage") is an important piece of legislation passed by the Haute Cour of Jerusalem, the feudal court of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, in an unknown year, but probably in the 1170s under Amalric I of Jerusalem. 
The Assise formally prohibited the illegal confiscation of fiefs and required all of the king's vassals to ally against any lord who did so. Such a lord would not be given a trial, but would instead be stripped of his land or exiled. The king could now legally confiscate a fief if a vassal refused to pay homage to him; this had been done in the past but was technically illegal before this Assise. The Assise was apparently created after a dispute between Gerard, Lord of Sidon, and King Amalric; Gerard had dispossessed one of his rear-vassals and refused to return the land even when Amalric stepped in. Open warfare was just barely avoided.
The Assise also made all nobles direct vassals of the king, eliminating the previous distinction between higher and lesser nobles. This distinction still existed in reality, and although they theoretically had an equal voice in the Haute Cour, lesser nobles could only appeal to the high court when their own baronial courts refused to hear their complaints. In any case, the more powerful barons refused to be tried by lesser lords who were not their peers, and the higher nobles were still able to judge the less powerful lords themselves. There were about 600 men eligible to vote in the Court according to the Assise.

[[Kournas]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Greece, Populated places in Chania (regional unit)

Kournas is the name of a village and nearby lake on the island of Crete, Greece. It is in the Apokoronas region of Chania regional unit close to the border with Rethymno regional unit, 47 km from the town of Chania. Kournas is a fairly large village perched on a hill overlooking the lake. It is in the Georgioupoli municipality, not far from the town of the same name. A working village which has seen less depopulation than some of its neighbours, Kournas is known for its pottery and many popular taverns. The taverna's seats are largely in the road - it is popular for its specialties of 'kokoretsi' (grilled offal) and 'galaktoboureko' (custard and orange tart).
Crete's only freshwater lake, Lake Kournas, is relatively large, with a perimeter of 3.5 km. Although almost all touristic leaflets say that it is possible to walk around the lake, that is not true. At least not at the end of the rain season (winter). There is a nature preserve on the Southwest of the lake. But there is a rustic road from the North of the lake to the Hills on the West of the lake too.
The lake used to be called 'Korisia' after ancient 'Korion', a city thought to be in the area with a temple to Athena. The lake reportedly used to be full of eels but now is better known for its terrapins and tourism. Tavernas and pedalo rental shops line part of the shore. Overall, however, the lake retains its beauty, the White Mountains reflected in the mirror-like waters. The width, at the point where the landing stage is built, is about 800 m and the water is of a quality to have caused no ill effects to the writer when he swam across.
If you stand, barefoot, in the water on the sandy beach, tiny fish will (painlessly) nibble dead skin from your feet for free! This is a treatment, which several tourist shops currently (2012) offer at a price.

The topmost surface is used to rest the person being changed, during the changing process while there are usually shelves or drawers to store necessary supplies such as diapers, baby wipes, baby powder and sometimes clothing as a dresser would have.

Donald Gordon McKenzie (April 9, 1887—May 14, 1963) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.  He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1928 to 1936 and was a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/hansard/members/mla_bio_deceased.html#M0 |title=MLA Biographies - Deceased |work=Legislative Assembly of Manitoba[/tpl]

Lucius Postumius Albinus was a statesman of the Roman Republic. He is not to be confused with his relative (father or uncle?), Lucius Postumius Albinus, who was killed in 216 BC.
Albinus was praetor 180 BC, and obtained the province of Hispania Ulterior.[tpl]Citation  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Lucius Postumius Albinus (15)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | pages = 91–92  | publisher = Little, Brown and Company  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0100.html [/tpl]  His command was prorogued in the following year. After conquering the Vaccaei and Lusitani, he returned to Rome in 178 BC, and was awarded a triumph on account of his victories.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xl.35, 39, 44, 47-50; xli.6-7.
He was consul in 173 BC, with Marcus Popillius Laenas. The war in Liguria was assigned to both consuls. Albinus, however, was first sent into Campania to separate the land of the state from that of private persons, because private land owners had slowly expanded their boundaries into public land. This business occupied him all the summer, so that he was unable to go into his province. He was the first Roman magistrate who put the Latin allies to any expense when a magistrate travelled through their territories.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xli.28; xlii.1, 9.  The festival of the Floralia, which had been discontinued, was restored in his consulship.Ovid, Fasti, v.329; and an English translation. 
In 171 BC, he was one of the ambassadors sent to Masinissa and the Carthaginians in order to raise troops for the war against Perseus of Macedon.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xlii.35.  In 169 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the censorship.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xliii.14. He served under Lucius Aemilius Paullus in Macedonia in 168 BC, and commanded the second legion in the battle with Perseus.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xliv.41. During the war, he was sent to plunder the town of Aeniae.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xlv.27.
He was probably a brother of Spurius Postumius Albinus Paullulus and Aulus Postumius Albinus Luscus.

Key Tronic (NASDAQ:KTCC) is a computer equipment manufacturer founded in 1969. Its core product group includes keyboards, mice and other input devices. They are considered to be one of the pioneers in ergonomic keyboard design.  Key Tronic operates worldwide with activities in The United States, Mexico, and China.
After the introduction of the IBM PC, Key Tronic began manufacturing keyboards compatible with the IBM PC keyboard.
Most of their keyboards are based on the 8048 microcontroller to communicate to the computer.  Their early keyboards used an Intel 8048 MCU, however as the company evolved, they began to use their own 8048-based MCUs.
In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of the first keyboard technologies to not use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other "solid-state switch" keyboards such as inductive and Hall-Effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards. Prices of $60 for keyboards were achieved and Key Tronic rapidly became the largest independent keyboard manufacturer.

The Dead Has Arisen has been both praised and criticized for its likeness to Half Dead's Long Beach friend Warren G's debut album 'Regulate ... G Funk Era'. Whilst it failed to achieve similar success to its predecessors Dre's 'The Chronic' and Snoop's 'Doggystyle', (and the album is not considered a landmark in West Coast rap), it did achieve local praise, and Lil' 1/2 Dead has been recognized as responsible for introducing and popularizing the smooth, laid-back rapping style along with Snoop Dogg and Warren G.

Route 367 is a [tpl]convert|8.9|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long roadway in the metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri, United States area. It is also known as Lewis & Clark Boulevard. Its northern terminus is US 67 near Black Jack and its southern terminus is at the I-70 bridge over Riverview Blvd. before Riverview Blvd. becomes Bircher Blvd. in St. Louis. It was originally part of US 67.
In December 2007, a multi-year reconstruction project to convert the St. Louis County portion of Route 367 to freeway status was completed.  The road was designed in the 1950s, and needed rebuilding, partly because of very short turn lanes and closely adjacent outer service roads.  The new freeway now helps to provide a more direct route between St. Louis and the Alton, Illinois section of the St. Louis Metro East.  Existing bridges were replaced at Chambers Road, Coldwater Creek, and the BNSF railroad tracks.  South of I-270, Route 367 is planned as more of a parkway, where both arterial and residential streets will continue to intersect the roadway.
In the City of St. Louis portion, no major improvements are planned. This section includes the Halls Ferry Circle, where six major roadways converge.

[[Captured! by Robots]]

CATEGORIES: American rock music groups, American experimental musical groups, Bands with fictional stage personas, American comedy musical groups, Musical groups established in 1996

Captured! by Robots (Version 1)is a touring musical comedy troupe with only one human member. It is part-concert and part-performance act, made up of three robots, two stuffed apes, three "headless hornsmen" playing backup brass, and their human, "JBOT". 
The group is composed of JBOT, the human "slave" to the robots (whose intestines hang from his abdomen); DRMBOT 0110, a severed doll's head that plays the drums; GTRBOT666, who plays bass and guitar; AUTOMATOM, the assistant drummer created by robots, The Ape Which Hath No Name who plays tambourine halo; The Son of the Ape Which Hath No Name, who plays Monkey Cymbals; and the Headless Hornsmen, a full three-piece horn section.
The C!BR backstory claims that the human, in an attempt to make his own band, created the robots. Instead of following him, they revolted, pulled out his intestines and eyes, and now force him to travel the world with them, performing music and making him contemplate the inferiority of the human race.
The end of this version 1 of C!BR is to happen on Aug 8, 2013 with the close of the "Captured! By Robots is Trippin' Balls" tour.
The V2fu.0 will make its debut in spring of 2014 along with a new documentary and album.

[[So Lo Pun]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Hong Kong, North District, Hong Kong

So Lo Pun (鎖羅盆) is a village in the northeastern New Territories, Hong Kong, within the Plover Cove Country Park. It is located northwest of Lai Chi Wo and northeast of Kuk Po.
The village was once the home of generations of the Wong family. Recorded history suggests that after migrating movement in a south easterly direction (supposedly from, what is now, Mainland China), the name Wong Wai Hing was an early settler and founding forefather of So Lo Pun village. Other early settler's are Tsu Kim Gong; Sing Lueng Gong; Yuk Chung Gong; Si Yuen Gong. (Gong meaning forefather in the Hakka Language). These people lived circa 872 AD.
Today, the village is now derelict and is uninhabited. Descendants have either emigrated abroad or have relocated elsewhere, for example, to Hong Kong City.
The closest researched descendants of the So Lo Pun village are as follows: Si Chow Gong; Tsip Yuen Gong; Chun Kee Gong; Yuk Man Gong; Si Tak Gong; Yuk Choi Gong (all deceased).
According to urban legend, the village is haunted.HK magazine: "Secret Hong Kong", October 16th, 2009 Hikers have also reported that compasses tend to stop working when they enter the village area, leading to the village being dubbed 'So Lo Pun', which in Chinese literally means that 'the compass is locked'.

[[Hooper Bay (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Boards of Canada albums, 1994 EPs

Hooper Bay was purportedly an EP created by Boards of Canada, issued in both vinyl  and cassette formats. The title refers to the small city of that name in Alaska, and all track titles on the album share a similar Alaskan theme.http://web.archive.org/web/20080117082017/http://fredd-e.narfum.org/boc/comments/#hooperbay Only 200 copies were purported to have been produced and none have publicly surfaced.
A small excerpt, about 35 seconds, of the track "Circle" was hosted on a website that held material relating to the group. The excerpt shows a melancholy kind of ambient music, similar to songs from Twoism. The site has since gone down, though the sample is currently available on YouTube.
Mislabeled mp3s claiming to be copies of Hooper Bay are in wide circulation on peer to peer networks, but are understood to be fakes. As with other rare Boards of Canada releases, some of these fakes are mostly mislabelled tracks by other musicians and bands. For example, "Geiser" is actually the experimental Icelandic group múm's "Smell Memory", and "Seaward Leaf" is actually "Slow Bicycle", another track by múm.

[[Komsomolskaya (Sokolnicheskaya Line)]]

CATEGORIES: Moscow Metro stations, Railway stations opened in 1935, Sokolnicheskaya Line

Komsomolskaya ([tpl]lang-ru|Комсомо́льская[/tpl]) is a Moscow Metro station in the Krasnoselsky District, Central Administrative Okrug, Moscow. It is on the Sokolnicheskaya Line, between Krasnye Vorota and Krasnoselskaya stations. It is located under Komsomolskaya Square, between the Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky, and Kazansky railway terminals. The station was named for the workers of the Komsomol youth league who helped to construct the first Metro line. It has a transfer at the-same-called-station on the Koltsevaya Line.
Komsomolskaya was built using the cut and cover method, with construction beginning on 3 May 1933. Temporary bridges were built over the construction site to avoid disrupting traffic, especially the numerous tram routes in the area. To counteract the high water table, the station was built on 636 piles which were driven into the saturated soil. 
Heavy rains in the summer of 1934 threatened the construction site several times, and at one point even the Kazansky terminal was in danger of collapsing. Nevertheless, the concrete structure of the station was completed by August 26 and Komsomolskaya opened on schedule on May 15, 1935.
Due to Komsomolskaya's location under a major transit hub, the station was built with an unusual upper gallery above the platform to help handle rush crowds. The station has tall pillars faced with pinkish limestone and topped with bronze capitals displaying the emblem of the Komsomol league. The station was designed by Dmitry Chechulin, and a model of it was displayed at the 1937 Paris World's fair.
The station's southern entrance vestibule is built into the Kazansky Rail Terminal. The northern vestibule is on the opposite side of the square, between the Leningradsky and Yaroslavsky rail terminals. The latter entrance did not survive in its original form, having been replaced with a massive structure serving both this station and Koltsevaya Line station in 1952.
There is a short branch line between Komsomolskaya and Krasnoselskaya stations, that leads to the Severnoe Depot. On 15 October 1934 the first Metro train left this depot for a trial run.

The grapheme Ć (minuscule: [tpl]unicode|ć[/tpl]), formed from C with the addition of an acute accent, is used in various languages. It usually denotes [tpl]IPA|t͡ɕ[/tpl], the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate, including in phonetic transcription. Its Unicode codepoints are U+0106 for Ć and U+0107 for ć.
The symbol originated in the Polish alphabet (where, in its modern usage, it appears most often at the ends of words) and was adopted by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj into South Slavic languages in the 19th century. It is the fifth letter of the Polish, Sorbian, and Gaj's Latin alphabet of Standard Croatian, Standard Bosnian, and, when written the Latin script, Standard Serbian and Standard Montenegrin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:53UAP67AS7QJ:www.eurozine.com/articles/article_2006-02-10-longinovic-mk.html+%22vra%C4%87anjeto%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk |title=Eurozine - BALKANOT VO PREVOD - Tomislav Longinovic |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20[/tpl] It is fourth in the Belarusian Łacinka alphabet.

Freda Wright-Sorce (June 7, 1955 – July 10, 2005) was the wife of Don Geronimo (Mike Sorce), half of the duo of the Don and Mike Show, a syndicated radio program in the United States. Because of her frequent call-ins to the show and other appearances, she was recognized as a supporting radio personality of some fame for her spirited on-air exchanges with her husband and the other personalities of the Don and Mike Show.
Wright-Sorce grew up in Montgomery County, Maryland, and attended Magruder High School. She had a radio career herself, working as a producer and part-time disc jockey in the 1980s at Washington-area stations WHFS, WASH-FM, and WAVA.  She met her husband at a radio convention. The couple has one son, Bart, who is a graduate of Clemson University in South Carolina.
On July 10, 2005, she died as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident on Maryland Route 90 near Ocean City. She was 50 years old and was considered an integral part of The Don and Mike Show.[tpl]cite news |title=Wife of Popular Radio Host Killed in Crash |date=2005-07-11 |url=http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=3578160 |work=WBOC-TV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051221190223/http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=3578160 |archivedate=2005-12-21 |accessdate=2013-08-28[/tpl] With Don absent, the entire following show on July 11, 2005, as well as the opening segment of the next show on July 12, 2005, was dedicated to remembering Freda. With Mike O'Meara, the other half of the Don and Mike Show, acting as the head of the show, Don was on hiatus until August 1, 2005, when he returned to the air. Without the other members of the show, he spoke as Mike Sorce, his real name, not as the "Don Geronimo" radio persona. Sorce spoke plainly and honestly about his wife of 20 years and read love letters they had written over the course of their 25 years together (including a letter he discovered Freda had left in the family safe to be read in the event of her death), played their favorite songs including "Don't Worry Baby" by The Beach Boys and "Everlasting Love".

William Burlie Brown (March 3, 1922 - June 29, 2005) was a historian at Tulane University, in New Orleans for nearly three dozen years.
W. Burlie Brown, who never used his first name, was a native of New Orleans. He entered Tulane as a pre-law student to please his parents. He was the first in his family to go to college.
After two years in the Pacific during World War II, as part of the Marines, Brown received his law degree (presumable from Tulane) and even practiced for two years, but eventually went back to school as a student in 1949, and left with a Doctorate in history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Dr. Brown joined Tulane's history faculty in 1951. He was awarded a Danforth teacher grant in 1955 and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1957. He was a consultant to the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare from 1963 to 1967.
"We talked as adults -- as colleagues, almost. That was very refreshing," said Christina Vella, who turned her dissertation on the Baroness de Pontalba into the book Intimate Enemies. "He was relaxed," Vella said. "In academia, you don't encounter that often. Professors are posing when they talk to students -- if not to them, then to themselves. He was not a poser."
Joe Louis Caldwell, a history professor at the University of New Orleans, remembered the morning that the habitually punctual Dr. Brown was late for class because he had been helping neighbors look for their missing daughter.
"He was really shaken by that experience," Caldwell said. "That certainly was not the stereotypical image of the aloof university professor in the ivory tower."
Dr. Brown, who retired in 1987, also was active in the Episcopal Church, serving on local and national committees and teaching classes for people considering joining the church. He was a member of the vestry at the Chapel of the Holy Spirit, the campus ministry for Tulane and Loyola universities.
At 83, he died leaving behind his wife, Gillian Fansler Brown, along with a son Robin Ernest Brown, and a daughter Jennifer Jo Brown. He also had three step sons, Stephen Hammond, Justin Hammond, and John Hammond. Eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

The Empress Hotel, located in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is a popular gay resort.[tpl]cite web|title=EMPRESS HOTEL|url=http://www.gay-destinations.com/newjersey.html|work=gay-destinations.com|accessdate=9 January 2011[/tpl]
The Hotel opened as a luxury resort for vacationing families in the 1960s. It was a successful resort, attracting the likes of Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli.http://www.newyorkqnews.com/2008/12/600w_santaSaturday/_w600.html
In 1980, the Empress was featured on the picture sleeve of Bruce Springsteen's hit single "Hungry Heart", which depicts a photo of Springsteen standing near a phone booth on the Asbury Park boardwalk, with the hotel visible in the background.
By the summer of 1976, Asbury Park was in a state of decline, albeit the Empress Hotel remained a popular establishment. During a New York Times interview, the hotel's manager boasted: "all of our 101 rooms are taken!"JOE SHARKEY. "The Past Is Dead in Asbury Park, but the Future Is Arriving." New York Times
Unfortunately, by 1988 the hotel was struggling for business, and closed shortly after. 
A strip club, Extreme Fahrenheit, opened in the building in 1993. It became notorious for drugs and prostitution, and was eventually closed because of lewd conduct.http://web.archive.org/web/20010817121714/http://www.betterwaterfront.com/news/00372000.shtml

[[Nuclear reaction analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Materials science

Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) is a nuclear method in materials science to obtain concentration vs. depth distributions for certain target chemical elements in a solid thin film. 
If irradiated with select projectile nuclei at kinetic energies Ekin these target elements can undergo a nuclear reaction under resonance conditions for a sharply defined resonance energy. The reaction product is usually a nucleus in an excited state which immediately decays, emitting ionizing radiation. 
To obtain depth information the initial kinetic energy of the projectile nucleus (which has to exceed the resonance energy) and its stopping power (energy loss per distance traveled) in the sample has to be known. To contribute to the nuclear reaction the projectile nuclei have to slow down in the sample to reach the resonance energy. Thus each initial kinetic energy corresponds to a depth in the sample where the reaction occurs (the higher the energy, the deeper the reaction).
For example, a commonly used reaction to profile hydrogen is 
with a resonance at 6.385 MeV.  The energetic emitted γ ray is characteristic of the reaction and the number that are detected at any incident energy is proportional to the concentration at the respective depth of hydrogen in the sample. The H concentration profile is then obtained by scanning the 15N incident beam energy.
Hydrogen is an element inaccessible to RBS due to its low mass, although it is often analysed by elastic recoil detection.
NRA can also be used non-resonantly. For example, deuterium can easily be profiled with a 3He beam without changing the incident energy by using the 
reaction.  The energy of the fast proton detected depends on the depth of the deuterium atom in the sample.

[[Malice (law)]]

CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Intention

This article is referring to the legal term. [tpl]For|Malice (disambiguation) law[/tpl].
Malice is a legal term referring to a party's intention to do injury to another party.  Malice is either expressed or implied.  Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a human being. Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. Cal. Pen. Code § 188. Malice, in a legal sense, may be inferred from the evidence and imputed to the defendant, depending on the nature of the case.
In many kinds of cases, malice must be found to exist in order to convict (for example malice is an element of the crime of arson in many jurisdictions). In civil law cases, a finding of malice allows for the award of greater damages, or for punitive damages.  The legal concept of malice is most common in Anglo-American law, and in legal systems derived from the English common law system.
In English civil law (being the law of England and Wales), relevant case law in negligence and misfeasance in a public office includes Dunlop v. Woollahra Municipal Council 1982 A.C. 158; Bourgoin S.A. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 1986 Q.B. 716; Jones v Swansea City Council 1990 1 WLR 1453; Three Rivers District Council and Others v Governor and Company of The Bank of England 2000Parliament.the-stationary-office.co.uk and Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 1995 2 QB 335 in which Steyn LJ. found that malice could be made out if the acts were done with an actual intention to cause injury. Malice could be shown if the acts were done in the knowledge of invalidity or lack of power and with knowledge that it would cause or be likely to cause injury. Malice would also exist if the acts were done with reckless indifference or deliberate blindness to that invalidity or lack of power and that likely injury. These elements, with respect, are consistent with the views of the majority albeit that some of those views were expressed tentatively having regard to the basis upon which the case before them was presented.
In English criminal law on mens rea (Latin for "guilty mind"), R v. Cunningham (1957) 2 AER 412 was the pivotal case in establishing both that the test for "maliciously" was subjective rather than objective, and that malice was inevitably linked to recklessness. In that case, a man released gas from the mains into adjoining houses while attempting to steal money from the pay-meter:
Lord Diplock confirmed the relationship to recklessness in R v Mowatt (1968) 1 QB 421:
In the United States, the malice standard was set in the Supreme Court case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, allowing free reporting of the civil rights campaign. The malice standard decides whether press reports about a public figure can be considered defamation or libel.

[[The Scream (band)]]

CATEGORIES: American hard rock musical groups

The Scream was a Los Angeles-based hard rock band formed in 1989 as Saints Or Sinners. The band originally featured former Angora singer John Corabi and former Racer X members guitarist Bruce Bouillet, bassist Juan Alderete, and drummer Scott Travis. However, Scott Travis quickly left to join Judas Priest, and was replaced by former Shark Island drummer Walt Woodward III. Scott Travis co-wrote "I Don't Care" on Let It Scream, though he didn't actually play on the album.
They changed their name from Saints Or Sinners to The Scream shortly after Walt Woodward III replaced Scott Travis.
Many of the songs on their 1991 debut Let It Scream were performed by the band in concert before the album was ever recorded.
After releasing their 1991 debut Let It Scream on Hollywood Records, which included the single "I Believe in Me," Corabi left the band to replace the exited Vince Neil in Mötley Crüe.  The Scream then recruited former Dashboard Mary singer Billy Fogarty and recorded their second album, Takin' It To The Next Level, but were dropped from the record label before the album could be released. The Scream split up and Fogarty, Bouillet and Alderete went on to form a brief musical project with John Moore and drummer Abe Laboriel, Jr. called DC-10, which recorded and released the album Co-Burn.
Walt Woodward III died on June 8, 2010 of alcohol poisoning.

[[Queckenstedt's maneuver]]
CATEGORIES: Physical examination

Queckenstedt's maneuver is an outdated clinical test, formerly used for diagnosing spinal stenosis. The test is performed by placing the patient in the lateral decubitus position, thereafter the clinician performs a lumbar puncture. The opening pressure is measured. Then, the clinician's assistant compresses both jugular veins (if increased intracranial pressure is not suspected then one may exert pressure on both external jugular veins but usually pressure is first exerted on the abdomen, this pressure causes an engorgement of spinal veins and in turn rapidly increases cerebrospinal fluid pressure), which leads to a rise in the intracranial pressure. Given normal anatomy, the intracranial pressure will be reflected as a rapidly rising pressure measured from the lumbar needle, within 10–12 seconds. If there is a stenosis in the spine, there will be a damped, delayed response in the lumbar pressure, thus a positive Queckenstedt's maneuver. Nowadays this test has been made mostly superfluous by superior imaging modalities like MRI and CAT.[tpl]cite journal |last=Pearce |first=JMS |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |date= June 2006|title=Queckenstedt's manoeuvre |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=77 |series= |issue=6 |page=728 |publisher= |location= |issn= |pmid=16705195 |pmc= 2077443|doi=10.1136/jnnp.2005.083618 |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format= |accessdate= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=[/tpl]

[[Special Intelligence Service]]
CATEGORIES: Intelligence agencies

[tpl]Other uses|Sis (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Sis[/tpl]
The Special Intelligence Service was a covert counterintelligence branch of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) located in South America during World War II. It was established during the term of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to monitor Axis activities in Central and South America.
In 1934, President Roosevelt began to grow concerned about activities of Nazi groups within the United States. The FBI was ordered to begin investigating these groups operating within the country. The goal of this work was to determine if foreign agents were working within these American Nazi groups.
In 1940, the government decided to expand the scope of this mission. There were more than 1.5 million expatriate Germans living in South America, including Argentina and Brazil. As a result this area had become an active area of Axis espionage, propaganda and sabotage. In June 1940, President Roosevelt ordered the formation of the Special Intelligence Service to monitor these activities.
The SIS allied with the BIS (Basque Intelligence Service) in Latin America."Federal Bureau of Investigation." Search results. Various years. http://vault.fbi.gov/search?SearchableText=Basque (accessed January 29, 2013).
It is presumptive that Assistant Director Percy E. "Sam" Foxworth was the first chief of the SIS. He died in a plane crash on 15 January 1943 with agent Harold Dennis Haberfeld. The second chief appears to have been Jerome Doyle.Anderson, Susan Heller. "Jerome Doyle, 79, Noted Lawyer Who Became a Public Defender." The New York Times, January 1, 1989: D27.
The headquarters of this organization was located on the 44th floor of the International Building, in the Rockefeller Center plaza in New York City. The front for the organization was actually an operating law firm. It took some time to become fully operational, due to language and cultural differences, but within a year the SIS had a number of agents in place under various covers.
This organization placed more than 340 undercover agents in regions of Latin America. They operated for seven years, and by 1946 a total of 887 axis spies had been discovered. Also found were 281 agents of axis propaganda, 222 smugglers shipping important war materials, and more than 100 saboteurs and other operatives. It located 24 secret Axis radio stations and confiscated 40 radio transmitters and 18 receiving sets.http://www.fbi.gov/page2/june05/history062405.htm
Following the war the SIS was disbanded, having been in operation in 1940-1946. After it was disbanded, its region of operation was incorporated in those of the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency.

Jeffrey Mylett (June 8, 1949 – May 7, 1986) was an American actor and songwriter.  Born in North Canton, Ohio, he attended Hoover High School there, and studied theater at Carnegie Mellon University.
He appeared in the original off-Broadway production of Godspell.  During its initial two-week run at La MaMa in New York City, the show featured songs by cast members, including two by Mylett.  When a team of producers interested in presenting the show in an open-ended commercial transfer brought in songwriter Stephen Schwartz to compose a new score, all the original songs (including Mylett's) were replaced, except for "By My Side" by Jay Hamburger and Peggy Gordon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godspell#Background |title=Godspell - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15[/tpl]
He also appeared in the off-Broadway musical Thoughts (1973), written by Godspell castmate Lamar Alford, and the Broadway musical The Magic Show (1974), in which he was Doug Henning's standby and also played the role during Henning's vacations.  During his scheduled appearances in the show, the character's name was changed from "Doug" to "Jeff."
He recreated his stage role in the film version of Godspell (1973), and also appeared in the films Money Talks (1972), Brewster's Millions (1985) and My Man Adam (1985).  He hosted The Rock 'n' Fun Magic Show, a 1975 television special featuring music, magic and comedy, with appearances by Doug Henning, Bill Cosby and the Hudson Brothers.The Daily Inter Lake, Kalispell, Montana, October 10, 1975, p. 2The Times-Reporter, Dover-New Philadelphia, Ohio, November 7, 1975, p.

In early 1977, he participated in the workshop in which the musical Working was created, but when the show premiered at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago and later played on Broadway, the roles he developed in the workshop were performed by Joe Mantegna.
He was devoted to spiritual teacher Meher Baba.[tpl]cite web|url=http://itsayskeds.bravehost.com/remembrances.htm |title=Remembrances |publisher=Itsayskeds.bravehost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15[/tpl]  In The God-Man, a documentary concerning Meher Baba produced for Australian television in 1976, he is interviewed and performs his song "House of the Lord."

King's Highway 140, commonly referred to as Highway 140, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The highway connects Port Colborne near Lake Erie with Highway 406 in Welland, via the Main Street Tunnel. It was constructed in the early 1970s as part of the Welland Bypass project of the Welland Canal, which resulted in the severance of several highways and rail lines. Opened to traffic in late 1972, several months following the tunnel, Highway 140 has remained unchanged since, despite growing calls to resign it as an extension of Highway 406.

Passages in the Old Testament book Leviticus that prohibit "lying with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination" and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah have historically been interpreted as condemning homosexual acts, as have several Pauline passages. Other interpreters, however, maintain that these passages do not condemn homosexuality, saying that historical context suggests other interpretations or that rare or unusual words in the passages may not be referring to homosexuality.

[tpl]legend|#c0bf78|Zaragoza, owing tribute to Sancho[/tpl]]]
García II (c. 1042 – March 22, 1090 AD), King of Galicia and Portugal,Although he was the only García to hold this title, a unified system has been used to enumerate the kings of Asturias, Galicia, León, and Castile, and there was an earlier García I of León, making the King of Galicia "García II". was the youngest of the three sons and heirs of Ferdinand I, King of Castile and León, and Sancha of León, whose Leonese inheritance included the lands García would be given.
In the 1065 division of his father's estates, García was given the Galicia, including the County of Portugal, as well as the right to parias from the Taifas of Badajoz and Seville. Calling himself 'King of Galicia and Portugal', he thus became the first to use the title King of Portugal. His power in the south of his polity was somewhat limited until 1071, when he defeated rebel Portuguese Count Nuno Mendes in the Battle of Pedroso.  However, shortly after this victory, his brothers united against him and forced García to flee to Seville, partitioned his kingdom between them.
Sancho then annexed the remainder of what had been García's kingdom along with the rest of Alfonso's Kingdom of León but was assassinated in 1072. The reunited kingdom of their father passed to Alfonso, and García then returned from his exile. It is unclear if he hoped to reestablish himself in his kingdom or had been misled by promises of safety from Alfonso, but García was immediately imprisoned in a monastery where he remained until his death sometime around 1090.

[[Salami tactics]]
CATEGORIES: Political terminology, History of Hungary

Salami tactics, also known as the salami-slice strategy, is a divide and conquer process of threats and alliances used to overcome opposition.  With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated "slice by slice" until one realizes (too late) that it is gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the "sliced" sides to protest. Salami tactics are most likely to succeed when the perpetrators keep their true long-term motives hidden and maintain a posture of cooperativeness and helpfulness while engaged in the intended gradual subversion.

[[Land sailing]]
CATEGORIES: Sailing, Dutch inventions

Land sailing, also known as sand yachting or land yachting, is the act of moving across land in a three-wheeled vehicle powered by wind through the use of a sail. The term comes from analogy with (water) sailing. Historically, land sailing was used as a mode of transportation or recreation. Since the 1950s it has evolved primarily into a racing sport.
Vehicles used in sailing are known as sail wagons, sand yachts, or land yachts. They typically have three (sometimes four) wheels and function much like a sailboat, except that they are operated from a sitting or lying position and steered by pedals or hand levers. Land sailing works best in windy flat areas, and races often happen on beaches, airfields, and dry lake beds in desert regions. Modern land sailors, generally known as "pilots", can go three to four times faster than the wind speed. A gust of wind is considered more beneficial in a land sailing race than a favorable windshift. A similar sport, known as ice yachting, is practiced on frozen lakes and rivers. Another variation is the Whike, which combines land sailing with bicycling and can therefore also be used in everyday traffic because it does not fully depend on wind.

Tracks are sometimes banked in the turns and on the straights.  This banking is utilized primarily to allow vehicles to carry more speed through the corners. However, some tracks prefer less banked turns. Each track surface will most often be different in one way or another.

The Japan Ice Hockey League (JIHL) (日本アイスホッケーリーグ) was an annual ice hockey league that began in 1966 and ended in 2004 when it was replaced by Asia League Ice Hockey. Only Japanese teams competed in the JIHL.
Baseball and football have been the dominant Japanese sports for decades, but ice hockey in Japan started in the 1920s.
Teams have been competing in the All Japan Championships since 1930, making the tournament one of the oldest sporting competitions in the country.
Professional hockey arrived in 1966 with the Japan Ice Hockey League. Originally a five-team league, the JIHL expanded to six teams in 1974 and stayed that way until tough economic times led to budget cutbacks and eventually the demise of the league in 2004.
Organizers decided the sport could only prosper in Asia if teams in Japan, China and South Korea formed a multinational league, and in 2004 the 38-year-old JIHL was abandoned in favor of Asia League Ice Hockey.

[[Three-field system]]
CATEGORIES: Agricultural soil science, History of Europe, Sustainable agriculture

The three-field system is a regime of crop rotation  in use in medieval and early-modern Europe from around the time of Charlemagne. Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar/different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons.Under this system, the arable land of an estate or village was divided into three large fields: one was planted in the autumn with winter wheat or rye; the second field was planted with other crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third was left fallow, in order to allow the soil of that field to regain its nutrients. With each rotation, the field would be used differently, so that a field would be planted for two out of the three years used, whilst one year it "rested". This allowed farmers to plant more crops and therefore to increase production. With more crops available to sell, this also helped the economy in general to thrive. The introduction of the three-field system and the adoption of the moldboard plow were parallel developments which worked hand in hand to increase the productivity of the land.
One of the first Germans to question this system, and new ways of expanding beyond this medieval system was Johann Friedrich Mayer, in his 1769 work Lehre vom Gyps als vorzueglich guten Dung zu allen Erd-Gewaechsen auf Aeckern und Wiesen, Hopfen- und Weinbergen.Roeber, A. G. (1998). Palatines, Liberty, and Property: German Lutherans in Colonial British America. p. 58.

CIBX-FM is a Canadian radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The station, which broadcasts at 106.9 FM, plays a Top 40 format and is branded as "Capital FM."
CIBX traces its history to the first radio station in New Brunswick, CFNB (the call letters naturally stood for Fredericton, New Brunswick). The station went on the air under the experimental callsign of 10AD and at 1210 kHz in 1923.  It was granted a full license as CFNB in 1926.  CFNB then moved to 1030 in 1933, and finally to 550 in 1934. The station was affiliated to the CBC's Trans-Canada Network. In 1959 the station increased its power to 50,000 watts, giving it full-time coverage over most of the Maritime Provinces. The CBC affiliation as dropped in 1964 when the network started its own station in Fredericton, CBZ. The station played an adult contemporary format before switching to oldies in the early 1990s.
In 1996, CFNB's parent company, Radio Atlantic was granted permission to move its signal to 106.9 FM and to eliminate its AM transmitter.Decision CRTC 96-9 The callsign changed in the process, and after a brief simulcast period, CFNB signed off on June 11 of that year. The new station, CIBX, played soft rock. The former CFNB callsign now belongs to a radio station out in D'Arcy, British Columbia, known as CFNB-FM. Over time, the station evolved towards hot adult contemporary.
Between 2000 and 2005, CIBX used the on-air "EZ Rock" branding along with other stations in Canada (while using "Capital FM" as a secondary name), though they have returned to using only the "Capital FM" name.
As of July 18, 2012, CIBX has officially flipped to Top 40.
CIBX and seven other radio stations in the Atlantic provinces are currently owned by Bell Media.

Biblioteka Imeni Lenina ([tpl]lang-ru|Библиоте́ка и́мени Ле́нина[/tpl]) is a station on the Sokolnicheskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. The station was opened on May 15, 1935 as a part of the first stage of the Metro. It is situated in the very centre of the city under the Mokhovaya Street, and is named for the nearby Russian State Library (called the Lenin Library in 1925 – 1992). Its architects were A. I. Gontskevich and S. Sulin.
To prevent the disruption of traffic, Biblioteka Imeni Lenina was built using underground excavation rather than cut and cover even though the station ceiling is just two metres below ground level. Soil conditions and the narrowness of the space in which the station was to be built necessitated a single-vault design, the only one on the first Metro line. The entire excavation was only 19.8 metres wide and 11.7 metres high. The main station vault was built from rubble stone set in concrete and reinforced with an iron framework. This was lined with an "umbrella" of bitumen-coated paper to prevent groundwater from seeping into the station. The station was finished with plaster, yellow ceramic tile, and marble.
The station originally had two entrance vestibules, one at either end. The southern vestibule, located between the old and new buildings of the State Library, is shared with Borovitskaya. The temporary northern vestibule, which served Biblioteka Imeni Lenina and Aleksandrovsky Sad, was removed in the 1940s.

[[Kropotkinskaya]]

CATEGORIES: Moscow Metro stations, Sokolnicheskaya Line, Railway stations opened in 1935

Kropotkinskaya ([tpl]lang-ru|Кропо́ткинская[/tpl]) is a station on the Sokolnicheskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. One of the oldest Metro stations, it was designed by Alexey Dushkin and Ya. Likhtenberg and opened in 1935 as part of the original Metro line.
The station was originally planned to serve the enormous Palace of the Soviets (Dvorets Sovetov), which was to rise nearby on the former site of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Kropotkinskaya was therefore designed to be the largest and grandest station on the first line. However, the Palace project was cancelled by Nikita Khrushchev in 1953, leaving the Metro station as the only part of the complex that was actually built.
Kropotkinskaya was constructed in a massive open trench measuring [tpl]convert|176|m[/tpl] long by [tpl]convert|25|m[/tpl] wide. The tunnels from Biblioteka Imeni Lenina were constructed using the cut and cover technique. The combination of unrestricted space and dry soil made for ideal conditions, and construction of the station took only 180 days from start to finish. Kropotkinskaya was completed in January 1935 and opened five months later, on 15 May 1935. The station was named Dvorets Sovetov until 1957, when it was renamed in honour of Peter Kropotkin, a geographer, philosopher, and anarchist theoretician born in the vicinity.
Since it was to serve as the gateway to the Palace of Soviets, great care was taken to make Kropotkinskaya suitably elegant and impressive. The station has flared columns faced with white marble which are said to have been inspired by the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Contrary to popular opinion, the marble used in the station did not come from the demolished Cathedral. The spacious platform is covered with squares of gray and red granite and the walls, originally tiled, are now faced with white Koyelga marble. The station is illuminated by concealed lamps set into the tops of the columns.
A model of the station won two Grand Prix awards at expositions in Paris (1937) and Brussels (1958). In 1941 the designers and engineers were also awarded the Stalin prize of the USSR for architecture and construction.
Kropotkinskaya opened with only one entrance vestibule, located at the end of Gogolevskiy Boulevard. This U-shaped structure was designed by S.M. Kravets and features two separate pavilions joined by a central arch. In late 1950s the station was given a slight reconstruction replacing the original cast of the upper pillars was replaced by marble and the floor was relayed with granite. The reconstruction finished with a new entrance which faces the Cathedral and Moskva River which was opened on 16 July 1960.
Because of the demise of the Palace of Soviets project, much of Kropotkinskaya's planned ridership never materialized. [tpl]As of|2013[/tpl] the station serves about 42,050 passengers daily, many of them tourists visiting the newly rebuilt Cathedral or the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts.
By 2015 a transfer to the Kalininskaya Line is planned to open. The future station will be called Volkhonka."Перспективы развития." Moscow Metro. Retrieved 14 Oct 2012.

[[Pretties for You]]
CATEGORIES: Alice Cooper albums, 1969 debut albums, Straight Records albums, English-language albums, Enigma Records albums

Pretties for You is the debut album by Alice Cooper. At this time, the name "Alice Cooper" referred to the band, not its lead singer, though the lead singer was also known as Alice Cooper. The music has a psychedelic flavor to it. The group had yet to develop the more concise hard rock sound that they would become known for. Most of the tracks from the album have a distinct loud and dynamic rock sound. However, very few songs have some sort of hard rock quality. Pretties For You was a critical and commercial failure, only briefly denting the Billboard Top 200, and none of its songs have ever been played live by Cooper since the release of his breakthrough album Love It to Death.Alice Cooper Tour Archive
The song "Reflected", Alice Cooper's first single, was later rewritten as "Elected" (which featured on their 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies). The band also performed during a party scene in the film Diary of a Mad Housewife(1970).personal experience (I saw the film during its original theatrical run) The artwork for this album was hanging on the wall of the living room in Frank Zappa's house.[tpl]cite web |url=http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?imgurl=ff002c907b64a1ff |title=LIFE: Musician Frank Zappa (R) w. parents (L-R... - Hosted by Google |publisher=Images.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl] However, his wife Gail Zappa claims that it was later stolen from them.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zappa.com/gzsez/questions/alice-master-tapes/ |title=Re: Questions about Alice Master Tapes[/tpl] The original painting was done by Edward Beardsley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/albums/a-pfy.php |title=Pretties For You |publisher=Sickthingsuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl]

Wilderness acquired diarrhea (WAD), wilderness-acquired diarrhea, wilderness diarrhea, or backcountry diarrhea, is diarrhea that is caused by pathogens that have infected people when they were in the wilderness. It is a much-discussed hazard among backpackers, hikers, campers and other outdoor recreationalists who visit remote areas of the developed world. Risk factors include insufficient washing of hands and food utensils and drinking untreated surface water.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hargreaves JS |title=Laboratory evaluation of the 3-bowl system used for washing-up eating utensils in the field |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=94–102 |year=2006 |pmid=16805145 |doi= 10.1580/PR17-05.1|url=http://www.wemjournal.org/wmsonline/?request=get-document&issn=1080-6032&volume=017&issue=02&page=0094 |quote=Diarrhea is a common illness of wilderness travelers, occurring in about one third of expedition participants and participants on wilderness recreation courses.
