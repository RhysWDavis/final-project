[[Blood chit]]

CATEGORIES: Military personal equipment, Military aviation

A blood chit is a notice carried by military personnel and addressed to any civilians who may come across an armed-services member – such as a shot-down pilot – in difficulties. As well as identifying the force to which the bearer belongs as friendly, the notice displays a message requesting that the service member be rendered every assistance.
Alternative names are escape and identification flags ([tpl]zh|c=人物證明書|p=rénwù zhèngmíng shū[/tpl]). Chit (also 'chitty') is a British English term for a small document, note or pass; it is an Anglo-Indian word dating from the late 18th century, derived from the Hindi citthi.[tpl]cite web|title=Chit source|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chit|accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl]
The idea of blood chit originates from 1793 when French balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard demonstrated his hot air balloon in the USA. Because he could not control the direction of the balloon, no one knew where he would land. Because Blanchard did not speak English, George Washington gave him a letter that said that all US citizens were obliged to assist him to return to Philadelphia.
In World War I, British Royal Flying Corps pilots in India and Mesopotamia carried a "goolie chit" printed in four local languages that promised a reward to anyone who would bring an unharmed British aviator back to British lines. The term "goolie" is British slang for "testicles" and was so called (and still is called by the Royal Air Force) because, in the areas where the chits were used, local tribesmen were said to turn over aviators to their womenfolk, who castrated the pilots for use as servants.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] But the British officer John Masters recorded in his autobiography that Pathan women in the North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955) of British India (now modern day Pakistan) during the Anglo-Afghan Wars would behead and castrate non Muslim soldiers who were captured, like British and Sikhs.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.amazon.com/Bugles-Tiger-Gurkhas-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304361569/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1276361279&sr=1-1|title=Bugles and a Tiger|author=John Masters|date=June 13, 2002|publisher=Cassell Military (June 13, 2002)|location=|isbn=0-304-36156-9|page=190|pages=|accessdate=5 April 2011[/tpl]
In the Second Sino-Japanese War prior to World War II, foreign volunteer pilots of Flying Tigers carried notices printed in Chinese that informed the locals that this foreign pilot was fighting for China and they were obliged to help them.[tpl]cite web|last=Rossi |first=Dick |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/tiger2.htm |title=A Flying Tigers Story |date=1980s |work=The Flying Tigers - American Volunteer Group - Chinese Air Force[/tpl] A text from one such blood chit translates as follows:

It is located at 6472 feet (1973 m) above sea level in the mountains of southeastern Idaho in the United States. It is on the southwest side of the Henrys Lake Mountains of northern Fremont County, approximately 2 miles  (3.2 km) south the continental divide along the Montana state line, just west of Targhee Pass.  The lake is located in Caribou-Targhee National Forest.
The lake provides the headwaters of the Henrys Fork, a tributary of the Snake River. The lake lies less than 10 miles (16 km) across the continental divide from the headwaters of the Missouri River in southwestern Montana.
It is estimated that there are 1.2 million catchable trout in Henrys Lake.  The Idaho State Record brook trout was caught there several years ago. On opening day 2013 several fish exceeding 13 pounds (Cutthroat Hybrids) and 9 pound brook trout were caught. There is a limit of two fish per day.  You keep the first big fish and the last fish you catch but you release 20 or more fish in between.  A young man (boy scout age) in 2011 caught 80+ fish with a little red bead on an egg hook from the County Boat Dock. Black leach and little white flies work as well.  Worms are the easiest.

George Washington Glick was raised on his father's farm near Greencastle, Ohio.  He enlisted for service in the Mexican–American War, but saw no action. At age 21 he entered the law offices of Buckland and Hayes (later President Rutherford B. Hayes); he was admitted to the bar two years later and established a moderate law practice, earning a reputation as a hard-working lawyer. Glick moved to Atchison, Kansas, in 1859 and formed a partnership with Alfred P. Otis. He served as a Union soldier in the 2nd Kansas Infantry during the Civil War. Elected to the Kansas State Legislature in 1862, he served for 14 of the next 18 years and was Speaker pro tempore in 1876. He served in both houses of the state legislature. Glick was well respected and considered "just and expert" by his colleagues.[tpl]cite web|author=Lawrence Kestenbaum |url=http://www.politicalgraveyard.com/bio/glenni-glotzbach.html |title=Index to Politicians: Glennda to Glotzbach |publisher=The Political Graveyard |accessdate=2010-08-09[/tpl]
He was elected Governor in 1882 and served until 1885. Legislation enacted during his tenure included the creation of a railroad commission, a "good roads" law, reassessment of tax laws, and the establishment of a livestock sanitary commission. He was later appointed pension agent in Topeka by President Grover Cleveland.
After 15 years of civic service, George Glick was forced to abandon his political career because of a throat infection that nearly destroyed his ability to speak. He continued, however, as an attorney for various railroads. He also managed his farm and served as a charter member and first vice president of the Kansas Historical Society.
Glick died in 1911 in Atchison, Kansas.http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/atchison/GWGlickbio.html

[[Presuppositional apologetics]]
CATEGORIES: Calvinism, Christian apologetics

Presuppositionalism is a school of Christian apologetics that believes the Christian faith is the only basis for rational thought. It presupposes that the Bible is divine revelation and attempts to expose flaws in other worldviews. It claims that apart from presuppositions, one could not make sense of any human experience, and there can be no set of neutral assumptions from which to reason with a non-Christian.[tpl]Sfn | Frame | 2006[/tpl]  Presuppositionalists claim that a Christian cannot consistently declare his belief in the  necessary existence of the God of the Bible and simultaneously argue on the basis of a different set of assumptions that God may not exist and Biblical revelation may not be true.[tpl]Sfn | Sproul | Gerstner | Lindsley | 1984 | p = 183[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification | date =July 2013[/tpl] Two schools of presuppositionalism exist, based on the different teachings of Cornelius Van Til and Gordon Haddon Clark. Presuppositionalism contrasts with classical apologetics and evidential apologetics. 
Presuppositionalists compare their presupposition against other ultimate standards such as  reason, empirical experience, and  subjective feeling, claiming presupposition in this context is:
[tpl]quote|a belief that takes precedence over another and therefore serves as a criterion for another. An ultimate presupposition is a belief over which no other takes precedence. For a Christian, the content of Scripture must serve as his ultimate presupposition…  This doctrine is merely the outworking of the lordship of God in the area of human thought. It merely applies the doctrine of scriptural infallibility to the realm of knowing.[tpl]Sfn | Frame | 1987 | p = 45[/tpl][/tpl]
Critics of presuppositional apologetics claim that it is logically invalid because it begs the question of the "truth" of Christianity and the non-"truth" of other worldviews.

Mycenaean Greek is the most ancient attested form of the Greek language, spoken on the Greek mainland, Crete and Cyprus in the 16th to 12th centuries BC, before the hypothesised Dorian invasion which was often cited as the terminus post quem for the coming of the Greek language to Greece. The language is preserved in inscriptions in Linear B, a script first attested on Crete before the 14th century BC. Most instances of these inscriptions are on clay tablets found in Knossos in central Crete, and in Pylos in the southwest of the Peloponnese. Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself, Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania in Western Crete.*[tpl]cite book |author=Chadwick, John|title=The Mycenaean World |publisher=Cambridge UP |year=1976 |isbn=0-521-29037-6[/tpl] The language is named after Mycenae, one of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece.
The tablets remained long undeciphered, and every conceivable language was suggested for them, until Michael Ventris deciphered the script in 1952 and by a preponderance of evidence proved the language to be an early form of Greek.
The texts on the tablets are mostly lists and inventories. No prose narrative survives, much less myth or poetry. Still, much may be glimpsed from these records about the people who produced them and about Mycenaean Greece, the period before the so-called Greek Dark Ages.

[[Short-circuit evaluation]]

CATEGORIES: Evaluation strategy, Articles with example C code, Articles with example Perl code

Short-circuit evaluation, minimal evaluation, or McCarthy evaluation denotes the semantics of some Boolean operators in some programming languages in which the second argument is executed or evaluated only if the first argument does not suffice to determine the value of the expression: when the first argument of the AND function evaluates to false, the overall value must be false; and when the first argument of the OR function evaluates to true, the overall value must be true.  In some programming languages (Lisp), the usual Boolean operators are short-circuit.  In others (Java, Ada), both short-circuit and standard Boolean operators are available. For some Boolean operations, like XOR, it is not possible to short-circuit, because both operands are always required to determine the result.
The short-circuit expression x Sand y (using Sand to denote the short-circuit variety) is equivalent to the conditional expression if x then y else false; the expression x Sor y is equivalent to if x then true else y.
Short-circuit operators are, in effect, control structures rather than simple arithmetic operators, as they are not strict. In imperative language terms (notably C and C++), where side effects are important, short-circuit operators introduce a sequence point – they completely evaluate the first argument, including any side effects, before (optionally) processing the second argument. ALGOL 68 used "proceduring" to achieve user defined short-circuit operators & procedures.
In loosely typed languages that have more than the two truth-values True and False, short-circuit operators may return the last evaluated subexpression, so that x Sor y and x Sand y are actually equivalent to if x then x else y and if x then y else x respectively (without actually evaluating x twice). This is called "Last value" in the table below.
In languages that use lazy evaluation by default (like Haskell), all functions are effectively "short-circuit", and special short-circuit operators are unnecessary.

Desmond (Des) McGrath (1935–2009) was a Catholic priest, and trade union organizer in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.  He was a candidate for the New Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election.
In the late 1960s, McGrath's parish consisted mostly of fishermen. He became concerned with their plight. Fishermen at that time were getting just two-and-a-half cents a pound for their catch, and lived off credit supplied by merchants, rarely having a season that enabled them to climb out of debt. McGrath felt that the only way for fishermen to improve their situation was if they formed a union. McGrath and St. John's lawyer Richard Cashin created the Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union. The union today represents not only fishing people, but plant workers and many others and, with over 20,000 members, is the largest private-sector union in Newfoundland.
In the late 1980s, McGrath started setting up adult education centres across the province, which provided key retraining when the cod fishery collapsed a few years later.
McGrath was found dead in his home on July 28, 2009, a day after failing to appear in court to answer charges that he sexually abused a boy in 1982. http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2009/07/29/mcgrath-dead-729.html

One somewhat uncommon and defining characteristic of Fat Wreck Chords is that they only sign one-record deals with bands. This allows the bands working with Fat Wreck Chords to have a choice as to if and when they want to put a record out on the label.BBC Jan-16-2003: Fat Mike on The Lock Up - NOFX Wiki In some cases, bands have released albums on Fat Wreck Chords but also on other labels.

It had limited power and was never intended to become a full political party, but played a role in supporting the election of Lib-Lab MPs.  The first secretary was Cooperative Society activist and trade unionist, Lloyd Jones.

[[Little Italy, Ottawa]]

CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods in Ottawa, Little Italys in Canada

Little Italy is a neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, situated in Centretown West and the cultural centre of Ottawa's Italian community. Bounded by  Albert Street to the north, Carling Avenue to the south, the O-Train tracks to the west, and approximately Bronson Avenue to the east, Little Italy intersects with Chinatown, whose business district centres on Somerset Street.
Little Italy was initially settled around 1900 by Italian immigrants. Following a fire at a small Murray Street chapel, the 1913 founding of St. Anthony of Padua Church at the corner of Booth Street and Gladstone Avenue cemented the immigrants' connections with the neighbourhood. In the years following World War II a second wave of Italian immigrants was joined by communities of Ukrainian and Polish immigrants in the area. In recent years with the integration of European immigrants the neighbourhood has found itself home to Asian immigrants, primarily from China and Vietnam.
In the 1960s a large section of the poorer neighbourhood was demolished, and replaced with the High School of Commerce, today the Adult High School in 1967.
Since 1974, each June the neighbourhood hosts the Italian Week festival, Ottawa's celebration of Italian culture.
Two area streets have been given commemorative Italian street names. Gladstone Avenue is also called Via Marconi, and Preston Street is called Corso Italia.
Big change is coming to the south end of the neighborhood at the intersection if Preston and Carling in the form of condo towers. Nearly a dozen projects are either proposed, approved or under construction, including three buildings that will claim the top three spots on the city's list of tallest buildings. These projects are fueled by a recent service improvement announcement for the O-Train line which will result in an eight minute headway between trains at Carling Station as well as a new community design plan calling for high density near the transit station.

[[Guernésiais]]

CATEGORIES: Guernsey culture, Languages of Europe, Norman language, Endangered Romance languages

Guernésiais, also known as Dgèrnésiais, Guernsey French, and Guernsey Norman French, is the variety of the Norman language spoken in Guernsey. It is sometimes known on the island simply as  "patois". As one of the Oïl languages, it has its roots in Latin, but has had strong influence from both Norse and English at different points in its history.
There is intercomprehension (with some difficulty) with Jèrriais-speakers from Jersey and Norman-speakers from mainland Normandy. Guernésiais most closely resembles the Norman dialect of La Hague in the Cotentin Peninsula (Cotentinais).
Guernésiais has been influenced less by French than has Jèrriais, but conversely has been influenced to a greater extent by English. New words have been imported for modern phenomena "le bike", "le gas-cooker".
There is a rich tradition of poetry in the Guernsey language. Guernsey songs were inspired by the sea, by colourful figures of speech, by traditional folk-lore, as well as by the natural beauty of the island. The island's greatest poet was George Métivier (1790–1881), a contemporary of Victor Hugo, who influenced and inspired local poets to print and publish their traditional poetry. Métivier blended local place-names, bird and animal names, traditional sayings and orally transmitted fragments of medieval poetry to create his Rimes Guernesiaises (1831). Denys Corbet (1826–1910) was considered the "Last Poet" of Guernsey French and published many poems in his day in his native tongue in the island newspaper and privately.
Wrote Métivier, Que l'lingo seit bouan ou mauvais / J'pâlron coum'nou pâlait autefais (whether the “lingo” be good or bad, I’m going to speak as we used to speak).
The most recent dictionary of Guernésiais, titled "Dictiounnaire Angllais-Guernesiais" (English-Guernsey Dictionary) and published by La Société Guernesiaise, April 1967 (revised edition published 1982), was written by Marie de Garis (1910–2010). In 1999 De Garis received an MBE for her work.

HMS ''Duncan was a D-class destroyer leader built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935 where she remained until mid-1939. Duncan returned to the Mediterranean Fleet just after World War II began in September 1939. She was transferred to the Home Fleet in December 1939, although she was badly damaged in a collision the following month, and required repairs that lasted until July 1940. The ship joined Force H at Gibraltar in October, escorting the larger ships and various convoys until March 1941 when she was transferred to West Africa for convoy escort duties for a few months. Duncan'' rejoined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla at Gibraltar in July and escorted several convoys to Malta during the rest of the year. After a refit, she briefly returned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla before joining the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean to participate in Operation Ironclad in May 1942. The ship was recalled home to be converted into an escort destroyer in late 1942.
Duncan was assigned to Escort Group B-7 in the North Atlantic after her conversion was complete in May 1943. She escorted a number of convoys before she required a lengthy refit from November to May 1944. She helped to sink two German submarines in October 1943. The ship was assigned to anti-submarine duties in the Western Approaches after her refit was finished in May 1944, and Duncan remained there until April 1945. At that time she was transferred to coastal anti-submarine patrols to counter any last-gasp effort by the Kriegsmarine to interfere with the Allied supply lines to the Continent. Placed in reserve the following month, Duncan was in bad shape and was sold for scrap later that year. The demolition, however, was not completed until 1949.

The Clark Fork is a river in the U.S. states of Montana and Idaho, approximately [tpl]convert|310|mi|km[/tpl] long. The largest river by volume in Montana[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl], it drains an extensive region of the Rocky Mountains in western Montana and northern Idaho in the watershed of the Columbia River. The river flows northwest through a long valley at the base of the Cabinet Mountains and empties into Lake Pend Oreille in the Idaho Panhandle. The Pend Oreille River in Idaho, Washington, and British Columbia, Canada which drains the lake to the Columbia in Washington, is sometimes included as part of the Clark Fork, giving it a total length of 479 mi (771 km), with a drainage area of  25,820 sq mi (66,870 km²). In its upper 20 mi (32 km) in Montana near Butte, it is known as Silver Bow Creek. Interstate 90 follows much of the upper course of the river from Butte to northwest of Missoula.
The Clark Fork is a Class I river for recreational purposes in Montana from Warm Springs Creek to the Idaho border.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fwp.mt.gov/content/getItem.aspx?id=24929 |title=Stream Access in Montana[/tpl]

[[Push poll]]
CATEGORIES: Political campaign techniques, Types of polling, Ethically disputed political practices

A push poll is an interactive marketing technique, most commonly employed during political campaigning, in which an individual or organization attempts to influence or alter the view of voters under the guise of conducting a poll. 
In a push poll, large numbers of voters are contacted briefly (often less than 60 seconds), and little or no effort is made to collect and analyze response data. Instead, the push poll is a form of telemarketing-based propaganda and rumor mongering, masquerading as a poll. Push polls may rely on innuendo or knowledge gleaned from opposition research on an opponent.
Push polls are generally viewed as a form of negative campaigning.Pollster.com: So What *Is* A Push Poll? Indeed, the term is (confusingly) commonly used in a broader sense to refer to legitimate polls that aim to test negative political messagesFeld, K. G. (2000). What are push polls, anyway? Campaign & Elections, 21(4, May), 62-63, 70. Future usage of the term will determine whether the strict or broad definition becomes the most favored definition. However, in all such polls, the pollster asks leading questions or suggestive questions that "push" the interviewee towards adopting an unfavourable response towards the political candidate.
In Northern Territory (Australia) legislation, push-polling is defined as any activity conducted as part of a telephone call made, or a meeting held, during the election period for an election, that: (a) is, or appears to be, a survey (for example, a telephone opinion call or telemarketing call); and (b) is intended to influence an elector in deciding his or her vote./ Northern Territory Electoral Act, Section 271: Offence relating to push-polling.
Push polling has been condemned by the American Association of Political Consultantshttp://www.theaapc.org/about/pushpolling/ and the American Association for Public Opinion Research.AAPOR | AAPOR Statement on "Push" Polls

[[Priority right]]
CATEGORIES: Intellectual property law, Patent law, Trademark law

In patent, industrial design rights and trademark laws, a priority right or right of priority is a time-limited right, triggered by the first filing of an application for a patent, an industrial design or a trademark respectively. The priority right allows the claimant to file a subsequent application in another country for the same invention, design, or trademark effective as of the date of filing the first application. When filing the subsequent application, the applicant must claim the priority of the first application in order to make use of the right of priority. The right of priority belongs to the applicant or his successor in title.
The period of priority, i.e., the period during which the priority right exists, is usually 6 months for industrial designs and trademarks and 12 months for patents and utility models. The period of priority is often referred to as the priority year for patents and utility models.
In patent law, when a priority is validly claimed, the date of filing of the first application, called the priority date, is considered to be the effective date of filing for the examination of  novelty and inventive step or non-obviousness for the subsequent application claiming the priority of the first application. In other words, the prior art which is taken into account for examining the novelty and inventive step or non-obviousness of the invention claimed in the subsequent application would not be everything made available to the public before the filing date (of the subsequent application) but everything made available to the public before the priority date, i.e. the date of filing of the first application.

Paul Grimault ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɡʁimo|lang[/tpl]; 23 March 1905 in Neuilly-sur-Seine – 29 March 1994 in Le Mesnil-Saint-Denis) was one of the most important French animators. He made many traditionally animated films that were delicate in style, satirical, and lyrical in nature.
His most important work is Le Roi et l'oiseau, which ultimately took over 30 years to produce. He began it as La Bergère et le Ramoneur (The Shepherdess and the Chimneysweep) in 1948 and it was highly anticipated, but Grimault's partner André Sarrut showed the film unfinished in 1952, against Grimault's wishes. This caused a rift between partners and a stop in production. In 1967, Grimault got possession of the film and subsequently was able to complete it in 1980 under a new title, Le Roi et l'oiseau, incorporating some footage from the original and re-hiring the original animators, together with some new, younger ones. There are many names for it in English that have been used in various releases, including: The King and the Bird (literal), The King and the Mockingbird, The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird and The King and Mr. Bird (1980).
He also collected his best shorts in a retrospective compilation movie, La table tourante (1988), which is included in the deluxe edition of Le Roi et l'oiseau. For a detailed bibliography, see this reference.

Robert Alton Harris (January 15, 1953 – April 21, 1992) was an American criminal and murderer who was executed at San Quentin State Prison in 1992 in connection with the 1978 murders of two teenage boys in San Diego. His execution was the first in the state of California since 1967. 
Harris was born in North Carolina and was abused as a child. He had run-ins with law enforcement as early as age 10, and was first placed into juvenile detention at age 13 for stealing a car. His mother abandoned him at age 14 and soon after he was again placed into juvenile detention after stealing another car. Following his release he found work, married, and had a son, but in 1975 he was imprisoned for manslaughter; he was paroled in January 1978.
On July 5, 1978, Harris and his younger brother commandeered a car occupied by two 16-year-old boys, ordered them to drive to a remote area, then killed them. The brothers then used the boys' car as their getaway car when they robbed a San Diego bank. Harris was arrested less than an hour after the robbery and charged with murder, auto theft, kidnapping, burglary, and bank robbery. He was convicted and sentenced to death on March 6, 1979. After a series of appeals and stays of execution, Harris was executed in San Quentin's gas chamber on April 21, 1992.

[tpl]For|other classes of the same name|C class destroyer (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]C-class destroyer|D-class destroyer (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]D-class destroyer[/tpl]
The C and D class was a group of 14 destroyers built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. As in previous years, it was originally intended to order a complete flotilla comprising eight destroyers—plus a flotilla leader as the ninth unit—in each year. However, only four ships—plus a leader—were ordered under the 1929–30 Programme as the C class. The other four ships planned for the C class were never ordered as an economy measure and disarmament gesture by the Labour government of Ramsay Macdonald. A complete flotilla—the 'D' class—was ordered under the 1930–31 Programme. 
The five ships of the C class were assigned to Home Fleet upon their completion, although they reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia of 1935–36 and enforced the Non-Intervention Agreement during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. They were transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in 1937–39 and spent most of their time during World War II on convoy escort duties in the Atlantic Ocean. Crescent was sunk when she was accidentally rammed by the British cruiser HMS Calcutta in 1940.  Crusader was sunk by a German submarine in 1942, though she had sunk an Italian submarine in 1940. The other ships of the class sank three German submarines during the war. They were all worn out by the end of the war and were scrapped in 1946–47.
The D-class destroyers were initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning, but were transferred to the China Station in 1935. Like the C class, most were temporarily deployed in the Red Sea when the Italians invaded Abyssinia, but returned to the China Station when that was over. They were still there when the war began, but reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterwards. Five ships were transferred to Home Fleet in December 1939, but Duchess was sunk en route when she was accidentally rammed by the battleship HMS Barham, and Duncan was badly damaged when she collided with a merchant ship, requiring lengthy repairs. Daring was sunk by a German submarine in February 1940. The other two participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April–June, but Delight was sunk by German aircraft in July and Diana was transferred to the RCN as a replacement for the Crescent after she eas sunk by the cruiser Calcutta. However, she too was rammed and sunk several months later by a freighter that she was escorting.
The four ships that remained with the Mediterranean Fleet sank three Italian submarines in 1940 while escorting Malta convoys and larger warships of the fleet. Several participated in the Battles of Calabria and Cape Spartivento that year. Duncan joined Force H at Gibraltar in October and escorted that group. Dainty was sunk by German bombers in February 1941 and Diamond in April whilst evacuating Allied personnel from Greece. Defender had to be scuttled in July when she was crippled by a German bomber when returning from escorting a convoy to Tobruk. Duncan and Decoy remained on escort duties for the rest of the year before being transferred to the Eastern Fleet in early 1942. They returned to the UK late in the year to begin conversions to escort destroyers. Decoy was transferred to the RCN in early 1943, but both became convoy escorts in the Atlantic. They sank two German submarines before being assigned to the UK to protect Allied shipping during Operation Overlord. They sank three more submarines before the end of the war and were paid off in 1945. Duncan was scrapped 1945–49 and Decoy during 1946.

[[Aerostat]]
CATEGORIES: Aerostats, Balloons (aircraft), Unmanned blimps

An aerostat (From Greek ἀήρ aer (air) + στατός statos (standing) through French) is a lighter than air craft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas. Aerostats include unpowered balloons and powered airships. A balloon may be free-flying or tethered. An aerostat's main component is one or more gasbags, a lightweight skin containing a lifting gas[tpl]cite book |title=The Chambers Dictionary |page=541 |publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd |year=2000 |origyear=1998 |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-550-14000-X |quote=the gas-bag of a balloon or airship[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Oxford Illustrated Dictionary |page=281 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1976 |origyear=1975 |location=Great Britain |quote=fabric enclosing gas-bags of airship[/tpl] to provide buoyancy, to which other components such as a gondola containing equipment or people are attached. Especially with airships, the gasbags are often protected by an outer envelope. One of the most recent deployments of an aerostat was seen at the opening ceremony of the nineteenth 2010 Commonwealth Games, held in Delhi, India. The aerostat used in the ceremony was the largest in the world.
Aerostats are so named because they use aerostatic lift which is a buoyant force that does not require movement through the surrounding air mass. This contrasts with the heavy aerodynes that primarily use aerodynamic lift which requires the movement of a wing surface through the surrounding air mass. The US Government Accountability Office has used the term "aerostat" in a different sense, to distinguish the statically tethered balloon from the free-flying airship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/650/649661.pdf |title=GAO-13-81, DEFENSE ACQUISITIONS: Future Aerostat and Airship Investment Decisions Drive Oversight and Coordination Needs |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: American music magazines, Jazz magazines, Publications established in 1934

Down Beat is an American magazine devoted to "jazz, blues and beyond", the last word indicating its expansion beyond the jazz realm which it covered exclusively in previous years. The publication was established in 1934 in Chicago, Illinois. It is named after the "downbeat" in music also called "beat one" or the first beat of a musical measure. 
Down Beat publishes results of annual surveys of both its readers and critics in a variety of categories.  The ''Down Beat'' Jazz Hall of Fame includes winners from both the readers' and critics' poll. The results of the readers' poll are published in the December issue, those of the critics' poll in the August issue. 
Well-known features of Down Beat magazine include its "Reviews" section where jazz critics, using a '1-Star to 5-Star' maximum rating system, rate the latest musical recordings, vintage recordings, and books; articles on individual musicians and music forms; and its famous "Blindfold Test" column, in a which a musician listens to records by other artists, tries to guess who they are, and rates them using the 5-star maximum rating system.
In April 1979, Down Beat went to a monthly schedule for the first time since 1939.

William Henry Eccles FRS (23 August 1875 – 29 April 1966) was a British physicist and a pioneer in the development of radio communication.
He was born in Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire, England. Following graduation from the Royal College of Science, London, in 1898, he became an assistant to Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian radio entrepreneur. In 1901 he received his doctorate from the Royal College of Science. Eccles was an advocate of Oliver Heaviside's theory that a conducting layer of the upper atmosphere could reflect radio waves around the curvature of the Earth, thus enabling their transmission over long distances. Originally known as the Kennelly–Heaviside layer, this region of the Earth's atmosphere became known as the Ionosphere. In 1912 Eccles suggested that solar radiation was responsible for the observed differences in radio wave propagation during the day and night.[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rspa.1912.0061[/tpl] He carried out experiments into atmospheric disturbances of radio waves and used wave detectors and amplifiers in his work. Eccles invented the term Diode to describe an evacuated glass tube containing two electrodes; an anode and a cathode.
Following World War I Eccles' main interest was in electronic circuit development. In 1918 he worked in collaboration with F. W. Jordan to patent the flip-flop circuit, which became the basis of electronic memory in computers.William Henry Eccles and Frank Wilfred Jordan, "Improvements in ionic relays" British patent number: GB 148582 (filed: 21 June 1918; published: 5 August 1920).

Reprinted in: Radio Review, vol. 1, no. 3 , pages 143–146 (December 1919). In 1919, Eccles became vice-chairman of the Imperial Wireless Committee. He helped in the design of the first long wave radio station, and became involved in the early work of the British Broadcasting Company (later the BBC) following its establishment in 1922.
William Eccles was a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). He was President of the Physical Society from 1928 to 1930, President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) in 1926, and President of the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB) in 1923-24.
He died in Oxford.

The Latin Casino (1960–1978) was a Philadelphia-area nightclub that first opened in 1948 at 1309 Walnut Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Many top entertainers  performed at the Latin including Harry Belafonte, Jimmy Durante,  Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Milton Berle, Lena Horne, Pearl Bailey,  Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton,  and Joey Bishop. The Latin was a very popular Center City nightclub for a decade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1995-06-20/entertainment/25689392_1_dresses-nightclubs-performers |title=South Jersey Had Its Day As Performance Hot Spot The Action Today Is On The Waterfront. Before Mtv, The Latin Casino Was The Place To Be. |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=2011-12-28 |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]
In 1960, Owners Dallas Gerson and Dave Dushoff, relocated to nearby Cherry Hill, New Jersey and built the plush 1,500-seat, Vegas-style dinner theater renamed from the "Latin" to the Latin Casino, although casino gambling was not included. It was considered one of the fanciest, hippest dinner nightclubs experiences of that time featuring dinner, drinks and a showcase of top entertainment.
Following a period of strong popular success, the Latin Casino finally closed in the summer of 1978 as an indication of an end of era and a symbol of the evolution of Pop culture. Five months later, at the height of the disco craze, it reopened as an exotic disco club, Emerald City (inspired by the Wizard of Oz fabled city Emerald City). Success was short lived and was converted to a venue for progressive rock bands and finally closed in December 1982 and later demolished for commercial use.

José Gabriel Túpac Amaru (March 19, 1742 – May 18, 1781) — known as Túpac Amaru II  — was the leader of an indigenous uprising in 1780 against the Spanish in Peru. Although unsuccessful, he later became a mythical figure in the Peruvian struggle for independence and indigenous rights movement and an inspiration to myriad causes in Peru.
Túpac Amaru II was born José Gabriel Condorcanqui in Surimana, Tungasuca, in the province of Cuzco, and received a Jesuit education at the San Francisco de Borja School, although he maintained a strong identification with the indigenous culture and population. He was a mestizo who claimed to be a direct descendant of the last Inca ruler Túpac Amaru.Native Insurgencies and the Genocidal Impulse in the Americas, Nicholas A. Robins He had been given the title of Marquis of Oropesa, a position that allowed him some voice and political leverage during Spanish rule.  Between 1741 and 1780 Amaru II went into litigation with the Betancur family over the right of succession of the Marquisate of Oropesa and lost the case.First among Incas: The Marquesado de Oropesa Litigation (1741–1780) en route to the Great Rebellion, David Cahill In 1760, he married Micaela Bastidas Puyucahua of Afro-Peruvian and indigenous descent.

He was quartered and beheaded by the Spanish in Cuzco in 1781.

[[Seed bead]]
CATEGORIES: Beadwork, Craft materials

Seed beads are uniformly shaped, spheroidal beads ranging in size from under a millimeter to several millimeters. "Seed bead" is a generic term for any small bead.  Usually rounded in shape, seed beads are most commonly used for loom and off-loom bead weaving.  They may be used for simple stringing, or as spacers between other beads in jewelry. Larger seed beads are used in various fiber crafts for embellishment, or crochet with fiber or soft, flexible wire. The largest size of a seed bead is 1° ("one-aught", sometimes written 1/0) and the smallest is 24°, about the size of a grain of sand.Weiss, Lesley. "Seed Beads." The Best of Bead and Button Magazine. Page 7 (retrieved 17 June 2011)  However, seed beads that are size 5° or 6° are usually called "pony beads" rather than "seed beads"; the next larger class of seed beads, from 3° to 4°, are usually called "trade beads"; the largest class of seed beads, including 1°, 2°, and anything larger, are usually referred to as "crow beads."  Most modern seed bead work is done using seed beads ranging in sizes 6°, 8°, 11°, 12°, 13° and 15°. Sizes 6°, 8° and 11° are often used in beaded knitting, as well as bead knitting. The extremely small class of seed beads smaller than 15° have not been in production since the 1890s and any in existence are usually considered antiques.  The very small holes in the centers of most seed beads means that stringing them usually requires the use of a specialized long narrow needle called a beading needle.

Wyle decided to leave the show as a regular character at the conclusion of season 11, despite offers to stay.*Coleridge, Daniel R., "Noah Wyle's 'ER' Dilemma," TV Guide, December 3, 2004 He cited a budding family and an already lengthy tenure on the show as reasons. Carter was then written out of the show by moving to Africa and marrying his love interest, Makemba Likasu, in the episode "The Show Must Go On".
Noah Wyle agreed to make two four-episode appearances in Seasons 12 and 13. While he did so in Season 12, his Season 13 episodes were pushed back a year to season 14.  Because of the WGA Strike, ER was renewed for a 15th season (it was originally slated to end after Season 14), during which Wyle appeared in five episodes as part of the show's plan to bring back former regulars.

The Chesapeake Affair was an international diplomatic incident that occurred during the American Civil War.  On December 7, 1863 Confederate sympathizers from Canada’s Maritime Provinces captured the American Steamer Chesapeake off the coast of Cape Cod.  The expedition was planned and led by Vernon Guyon Locke of Nova Scotia and John Clibbon Brain.Locke was born in Sandy Point, Shelburne County, Nova Scotia in 1827.  At the advent of the rebellion, Locke offered his services to the south.  He secured his ship Retribution’s letter of marquee.  His alias was John Parker to cover his privateering activities (See Maquis, p.136).   George Wade of New Brunswick killed one of the American crew.  The Confederacy had claimed its first fatal casualty in New England waters.Marquis, p. 143   The Confederate sympathisers had planned to re-coal at Saint John, New Brunswick and then head south to Wilmington, North Carolina.Hoy, p. 180   Instead, the captors  experienced difficulties at Saint John, which required them to move further north and re-coal in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  American forces violated British sovereignty by trying to arrest the captors in Nova Scotian waters, which further escalated the affair.  Wade and others were able to escape through the assistance of prominent Nova Scotian and Confederate sympathiser William Johnston Almon.
The Chesapeake Affair was one of the most sensational international incidents that occurred during the American Civil War.Hoy, p. 179    The incident briefly threatened to bring Great Britain into the war against the North.Hoy, p. 182

Luna Sea (stylized as LUNA SEA) is a Japanese rock band formed in Kanagawa Prefecture in 1986. Due to the use of make-up and costumes early in their career and their widespread popularity, they are considered one of the most successful and influential bands in the visual kei movement. Throughout the mid-1990s they used significantly less make-up, and after a one-year break in 1998, came back with a more mainstream alternative rock style and toned down their on-stage attire. When they disbanded in 2000, they left a big mark on the Japanese rock scene. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Luna Sea at number 90 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts.[tpl]cite web|title=Top 100 Japanese pops Artists - No.90|work=hmv.co.jp|url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/news/newsDetail.asp?newsnum=308150081|accessdate=2011-09-06|language=Japanese[/tpl]
Founded in 1986, by bassist J and rhythm guitarist Inoran while in high school, the band was originally called Lunacy. In 1989 they recruited lead guitarist Sugizo, drummer Shinya and vocalist Ryuichi, a lineup that has remained the same. They released a few demo tapes prior to renaming themselves Luna Sea in 1991 and releasing their self-titled debut album. The band achieved their breakthrough success with a sold-out tour in 1991, which helped them get a contract with MCA Victor, and with the release of their second album Image (1992), which reached number nine on the Oricon music chart. Following the critically acclaimed albums Eden (1993), Mother (1994) and Style (1996), the band switched to Universal in 1998 and released their best-selling studio album, Shine. In late 2000, after their seventh studio album Lunacy, Luna Sea disbanded. In 2007, Luna Sea reunited for a one-off reunion concert at the Tokyo Dome, and again in 2008 for the hide memorial summit. In 2010 the group officially reunited and held a world tour, and three years later they released their first new album in thirteen years, A Will.

Stolen Summer is a 2002 drama film about a Catholic boy who befriends a terminally ill Jewish boy and tries to convert him, believing that it is the only way the Jewish boy will get to Heaven.  Directed by first time writer/director Pete Jones, Stolen Summer is the first film produced for Project Greenlight, an independent film competition created by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and sponsored by HBO.Stolen Summer New York Times.  Project Greenlight aired on HBO as a documentary series chronicling the selection of Jones's script from approximately seven thousand entries, and the production of the film in Chicago in 2001.

Development work started on the N-1 in 1959. Its first stage is the most powerful rocket stage ever built.http://www.raceforspace.co.uk/page1/page11/files/C8B04FC7-RfS_06_PRINT_lr%2026.pdf
The N1-L3 version was developed to compete with the United States Apollo Saturn V to land a man on the Moon. The basic N1 launch vehicle had three stages, which was to carry the L3 lunar payload into low Earth orbit. The L3 contained an Earth departure stage and a lunar landing assist stage, in addition to the single-cosmonaut LK Lander spacecraft, and a two-cosmonaut Soyuz 7K-LOK lunar orbital spacecraft.
N1-L3 was under-funded and under-tested, and started development in October 1965, almost four years after the Saturn V. The project was badly derailed by the death of its chief designer Sergei Korolev in 1966. Each of the four attempts to launch an N1 failed; during the second launch attempt the N1 rocket crashed back onto its launch pad shortly after liftoff and exploded, resulting in one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions in human history. The N1 program was suspended in 1974, and in 1976 was officially canceled. Along with the rest of the Soviet manned Moon programs, the N1 was kept secret almost until the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991; information about the N1 was first published in 1989.

Lovis Corinth (21 July 1858 – 17 July 1925) was a German painter and printmaker whose mature work realized a synthesis of impressionism and expressionism.
Corinth studied in Paris and Munich, joined the Berlin Secession group, later succeeding Max Liebermann as the group's president. His early work was naturalistic in approach. Corinth was initially antagonistic towards the expressionist movement, but after a stroke in 1911 his style loosened and took on many expressionistic qualities. His use of color became more vibrant, and he created portraits and landscapes of extraordinary vitality and power. Corinth's subject matter also included nudes and biblical scenes.

The Invincible was a 74-gun French ship of the line, later a third-rate of the Royal Navy.
During the early part of the 18th century British ship designers had made few significant advances in design, whereas French shipbuilding benefited from a remarkably creative period. At the time of the capture of Invincible, there was not one 74-gun ship in the Royal Navy. By 1805 at the battle of Trafalgar, three quarters of British ships of the line were of this singular design and the 74-gun ship had become the backbone of all major navies of the world.
Invincible was one of the first trio of a new and longer type of 74-gun ships. Until 1738, French 74s had been little more than 154 (French) feet in gundeck length, carrying just thirteen pairs of 36-pdr guns on the lower deck, fourteen pairs of 18-pdr guns on the upper deck and eight pairs of 8-pdr guns on the quarterdeck and forecastle, with the balance of the 74 guns made up of four small 4-pdr guns on the poop.  
This was changed by François Coulomb's design for the Terrible, launched in 1739 at Toulon. The gundeck length was stretched to 164 (French) feet, and the four small guns on the poop were eliminated, replaced by new gunports for an additional pair of 36-pdr guns on the lower deck and an extra pair of 18-pdr guns on the upper deck.  This new gun establishment became the standard for all subsequent French 74s.  The next two ships, Invincible designed by Pierre Morineau and Le Magnanime designed by Blaise Geslain, were begun in early 1741 at Toulon and were each even longer than Le Terrible.  
At the First Battle of Cape Finisterre (14 May 1747) during the War of the Austrian Succession, Invincible was escorting a convoy of merchant ships when she was sighted by the British channel fleet of 16 ships of the line, which gave chase. Invincible attacked the British ships to give the convoy a chance to escape, and alone engaged six British warships. In the end with most of her crew dead or wounded she struck her colours. Gracious in defeat, the French Commander, Saint-Georges, handed his sword to Admiral George Anson.
HMS ''Invincible sank in February 1758 when she hit a sandbank in the East Solent.[tpl]cite book |title=Dive Wight and Hampshire |last=Pritchard |first=Martin |last2=McDonald |first2=Kendall  |year=1987 |publisher=Underwater World Publications |isbn=0-946020-15-9 |pages=85-86 [/tpl] The ship remained upright for 3 days after its grounding allowing the crew to safely escape. The wreck site was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act on 30 September 1980. In 1996 Amer Ved'' grounded at the wrecksite, although it is not clear whether or not this resulted in damage to the remains.In 2013 the wreck was placed on English Heritage's list of ten most at risk heritage sites due to parts of the ship being exposed by changing seabed levels.[tpl]cite news |title=HMS Invincible wreck 'at risk' English Heritage site |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-24463265 |newspaper=BBC News |date=10 October 2013  |accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl]

[[Bank run]]

CATEGORIES: Banking, Systemic risk, Financial crises, Business cycle, Economic problems

A bank run (also known as a run on the bank) occurs in a fractional reserve banking system when a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a financial institution at the same time and either demand cash or transfer those funds into government bonds, precious metals or stones, or a safer institution because they believe that the financial institution is, or might become, insolvent. As a bank run progresses, it generates its own momentum, in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy (or positive feedback loop) – as more people withdraw their deposits, the likelihood of default increases, thus triggering further withdrawals. This can destabilize the bank to the point where it runs out of cash and thus faces sudden bankruptcy.
A banking panic or bank panic is a financial crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as people suddenly try to convert their threatened deposits into cash or try to get out of their domestic banking system altogether. A systemic banking crisis is one where all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out. The resulting chain of bankruptcies can cause a long economic recession as domestic businesses and consumers are starved of capital as the domestic banking system shuts down.  According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve System,http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/ and much of the economic damage was caused directly by bank runs. The cost of cleaning up a systemic banking crisis can be huge, with fiscal costs averaging 13% of GDP and economic output losses averaging 20% of GDP for important crises from 1970 to 2007.
Several techniques have been used to try to prevent or mitigate the effects of bank runs. They have included government bailouts of banks, supervision and regulation of commercial banks, the organization of central banks that act as a lender of last resort, the protection of deposit insurance systems such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and after a run has started, a temporary suspension of withdrawals. These techniques do not always work: for example, even with deposit insurance, depositors may still be motivated by beliefs they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization.

[[North Carolina Councils of Governments]]

CATEGORIES: North Carolina Councils of Governments

The North Carolina Councils of Government (or the Regional Councils of Government) are voluntary associations of county and municipal governments, established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1972 that serve as an avenue for local governments across North Carolina to discuss issues that are particular to their region.  In banding together at the regional level, the voice of one community becomes the voice of many, thus providing a better opportunity for those issues to be addressed.  Today the majority of citizens and local governments in North Carolina are represented by regional councils, making them an increasingly important facet of local government operations.  The following entry provides a glimpse into these organizations, showing how they have evolved with respect to the services they provide and how they are funded.  Lastly, a summary of the enabling statutes that allow these councils to function in North Carolina has been provided.

New Turkey Party ([tpl]lang-tr|Yeni Türkiye Partisi[/tpl], YTP) was a political party in Turkey. It was founded in 2002 following a leadership crisis in the Democratic Left Party ([tpl]lang-tr|Demokratik Sol Parti[/tpl], DSP) that was the major partner in a three party coalition government.
The health condition of elder statesman Bülent Ecevit, the Prime Minister and leader of the party led to rumours that his Deputy Prime minister and Minister of State, Hüsamettin Özkan, was plotting to replace him. As a result Özkan was forced to resign. However, nearly half of DSP's parliamentarians followed him including İsmail Cem, the Minister of Foreign affairs. Özkan, Cem and Kemal Derviş, the Minister of State in charge of economy and the former Vice President of the World Bank, then decided to establish a new social democratic party, Yeni Türkiye Partisi. Cem became the leader of the party.  
The new party was received warmly by the public opinion. Most of the electorate was critical of the government because of the economic crises in 2000 and 2001 as well as the poor health of Ecevit. However, things started to look bad for YTP as the party showed signs of organizational weakness. Moreover, Derviş changed his mind and joined the Republican People's Party (CHP) instead. As a result, the YTP performed dismally in the November 3, 2002 general elections (receiving only 1.2% of the eligible votes cast) and again in the March 2004 local elections. 
In October 2004, the YTP was merged into the Republican People's Party (CHP).

In 1975, Prophet founded Church Universal and Triumphant, which became the umbrella organization for the movement, and which she expanded worldwide. Prophet controversially called on her members in the late 1980s to prepare for the possibility of nuclear war at the turn of the decade, encouraging them to construct fallout shelters. In 1996, Prophet handed day-to-day operational control of her organization to a president and board of directors, maintaining her role as spiritual leader until her retirement due to health reasons in 1999.
During the 1980s and 1990s, Prophet appeared on Larry King Live, Donahue and Nightline, among other television programs.DeHaas, Jocelyn H.

[[Sister show]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional crossovers, Television terminology

Sister shows are two or more television shows which exist in the same fictional universe and which may have crossovers. They differ to a degree from spin-offs in that shows may air simultaneously, rather than being derived from, and replacing, another. The popularity of most shows is limited to a few seasons, and sister shows allow expanding the immediate audience and ratings share. This is accomplished by using mostly different actors and production facilities. Sister shows often shift styles or target audience slightly, for a larger overall market. Thus The Beverly Hillbillies emphasizes slapstick, while Green Acres emphasizes surreal humor.

Waterzooi is a Belgian dish of stew, originating in Flanders. Its name derives from the Dutch term "zooien" meaning "to boil".  It is sometimes called Gentse Waterzooi which refers to the Belgian town of Ghent where it originated. The original dish is often made of fish, either freshwater or sea, (known as Viszooitje), though today chicken waterzooi (Kippenwaterzooi) is more common. The most accepted theory is that rivers around Ghent became too polluted and the fish there disappeared.gentblogt.be It is said to have been the favourite dish of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor who was born in Ghent.

George Kilpatrick Reinholt  (August 22, 1940 — November 11, 2013) was an American actor.
Reinholt is best known for his soap roles: Steve Frame on Another World from 1968 to 1975, and Tony Harris Lord on One Life to Live from 1975 to 1977.
He was fired from Another World in 1975 when head writer Harding Lemay wrote him out of the program. In his memoir, Eight Years in Another World, Lemay had pegged Reinholt's behavior to be not unlike a diva. Reinholt was known for giving interviews from the soap press in which he criticized the show's writing. Lemay also said that Reinholt's acting style was uneven, and that he could be brilliant in one scene and then mediocre in the next. The final straw seemed to come when he tried to prevent both Lemay and executive producer Paul Rauch from introducing Steve's family to the AW canvas, and Lemay wrote him off of AW by killing his character off in a helicopter crash (Steve would eventually return to the show in the early 1980s, played by David Canary). In a well-publicized move, Reinholt nabbed jobs both for him and his on-screen love interest, Jacqueline Courtney, on rival soap One Life to Live. Reinholt made it a point of letting the press know that he was happy to be leaving AW and going to a soap that knows how to write for actors.
After retiring from acting Reinholt swore off any comebacks in the medium. His resolve was weakened twice, once when he returned briefly for AW's 25th anniversary show in 1989, and another time when he considered returning in the mid-1990s. However he was not hired for any of the jobs he tested for.
In 1997 Reinholt placed an ad in a local paper offering his services to take women to parties or other events. Some of the press implied he was selling himself as an escort, in a sexual manner. Reinholt was furious and appeared on the Sally Jessy Raphael talk show to clear up the record.
On November 11, 2013 Reinholt died of cancer at his home in Essington, Pennsylvania at the age of 73.

CATEGORIES: Spacesuits

A space activity suit (SAS) or mechanical counterpressure suit is an experimental spacesuit which applies stable pressure against the skin by means of skintight elastic garments. The SAS is not inflated like a conventional spacesuit: it uses mechanical pressure, rather than air pressure, to compress the human body in low-pressure environments. Development was begun by NASA and the Air Force in the late 1950s and then again in the late 1960s, but neither design was used. Research is under way at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on a "Bio-Suit" System which is based on the original SAS concept.[ref]

William Holburne (died 1 April 1760) (also known as William Holborne and William Holburn) was an officer of the Royal Navy.
William was the brother of Francis Holburne, a naval officer who rose to flag rank. William also entered the navy, and may have served aboard the 74-gun third rate [tpl]HMS|Kent|1746|6[/tpl], during her time with Admiral Sir Edward Hawke's fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre.
Holburne was promoted to command a sloop on 21 April 1747, and was further advanced to command HMS Prince Frederick on 15 April 1748. He was appointed to command HMS Ramillies in 1755, during the Seven Years' War. Ramillies was part of a squadron commanded by William's brother, Commodore Francis Holburne. William took command of the 74-gun [tpl]HMS|Terrible|1747|6[/tpl] in 1755, and Francis shifted his pennant to her.
William Holburne took command of the 80-gun [tpl]HMS|Newark|1695|6[/tpl], which formed part of the expedition to Louisbourg under his brother in 1757. He went to the Mediterranean in 1759, and served as part of Admiral Sir Edward Boscawen's fleet at the Battle of Lagos. During the battle Boscawen's flagship, [tpl]HMS|Namur|1756|6[/tpl] was badly damaged and un-manoeuvrable. Boscawen therefore shifted his flag to Holburne's Newark. Holburne did not command any more ships after Newark, and died on 1 April 1760.

Animal Magic was a BBC children's television series which ran from 1962 to 1983 from BBC Bristol.  It began fortnightly and was transmitted weekly from 1964.
The presenter was the avuncular Johnny Morris. His charismatic style and genuine fondness for animals made the show an instant hit with children and adults alike. The show combined jovial voiceovers applied to various animals from Bristol Zoo with some basic educational features.
Morris' co-presenters over the years were: Gerald Durrell, Tony Soper, Keith Shackleton, Roger Tabor, Sheila Young, David Taylor and Terry Nutkins. When Nutkins joined the show in the early 1980s, the producers tried to update it, using new video effects technology. This allowed them to do such things as "shrink" the presenters to allow them to see life from an ant's viewpoint, or to swim in a riverbed for example. Dottie the ring-tailed lemur appeared as a regular guest for eight years in the 1970s.  Much to Morris' anger, the show was discontinued in 1983 when the programme's anthropomorphic treatment of animals fell out of fashion.
The 100th edition was transmitted on 4 January 1967.
Many editions of the show were junked by the BBC in the early 1990s when they were assumed to be of no further use. Recent documentaries such as The Way We Went Wild have had to resort to using clips from off-air recordings of some shows.
The signature tune, "Las Vegas", performed by Group Forty Orchestra, was written by Laurie Johnson in 1962.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

The Kootenay (Kootenai in the U.S.[tpl]Gnis|384301|Kootenai River[/tpl] and historically called the Flatbow) is a major river in southeastern British Columbia, Canada and the northern part of the U.S. states of Montana and Idaho. It is one of the uppermost major tributaries of the Columbia River, which is the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean. The Kootenay River runs [tpl]convert|781|km|mi[/tpl] from its origins in the Kootenay Ranges of the Canadian Rockies, exiting British Columbia's East Kootenay region via northwestern Montana and the northernmost Idaho Panhandle to return to Canada in the West Kootenay region, where it ends at the city of Castlegar, British Columbia.
Born in glaciers and flowing through a rugged landscape of mountains and valleys, this river drains an isolated and sparsely populated region of the Pacific Northwest. Between the highest headwaters  and the Columbia River, the Kootenay’s elevation dips by over two kilometers. Although comparable by length, watershed and discharge to the Columbia above where the two rivers meet, the Kootenay is of a very different character. Its dramatic drop,  caused by  a steep gradient, results in the formation of many rapids.
People of the Ktunaxa (Kootenai) tribe were the first to live along its banks, and for hundreds of years, they hunted and fished on the river, quite isolated from neighboring indigenous groups .[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] In the 19th century, a Canadian explorer, David Thompson, became the first recorded European to reach the Kootenay and established trading posts throughout the region. A gold rush on the Kootenay and later silver and galena strikes in its western basins in the late 19th century attracted thousands of miners and settlers to the region, who soon were followed by the arrival of railroads and steamboats. As mines, mills and factories continued to operate on the river, the Doukhobors, a Russian religious sect established a short-lived colony,  Brilliant, at the Kootenay's mouth. The people dispersed into many settlements, quickly becoming a major influence to the lumber and food industries in the region.
As with many Pacific Northwest rivers, dams were built on the Kootenay in the 20th century to generate hydroelectricity, and protect against floods and droughts. Today, over [tpl]convert|150|km|mi[/tpl] of the river have been impounded behind five dams — and a sixth to raise the level of Kootenay Lake, the largest natural lake formed by the Kootenay, and one of the largest in British Columbia.

The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) is the professional society for the field of aerospace engineering. The AIAA was founded in 1963 from the merger of two earlier societies: the American Rocket Society (ARS), founded in 1930 as the American Interplanetary Society (AIS), and the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences (IAS), founded in 1932 as the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences.
AIAA is the U.S. representative on the International Astronautical Federation and the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences. [tpl]As of|2004[/tpl], AIAA has more than 35,000 members. Despite its name, the society has members among aerospace professionals worldwide, although the majority are American and/or live in the United States. Some AIAA seminars and conventions are restricted to U.S. citizens, due to security issues.
AIAA is split to seven regions, North-East, South-East, Central, South-Central, Mid-West, West, and International.  The regions are subdivided into Sections, usually based in major cities.  Universities with programs in aerospace engineering or related fields may form Student Branches, which are overseen and in part funded by their parent Section.
Another aspect of AIAA is their standards writing activities.  In the past, AIAA standards for aeronautics have been incorporated into broader standards and public laws.  These standards help transition innovative aeronautical ideas to everyday usage.

[[KOI character encodings]]

CATEGORIES: Character sets

KOI is a family of several code pages for the Cyrillic script.
The name stands for Kod Obmena Informatsiey ([tpl]lang-ru|Код Обмена Информацией[/tpl]) which means "Code for Information Exchange".
A particular feature of the KOI code pages is that the text remains human-readable when the leftmost bit is stripped, should it inadvertently pass through equipment or software that can only deal with 7 bit wide characters. This is due to characters being placed in a special order (128 codepoints apart from the Latin letter they look most similar to), which, however, does not correspond to the alphabetic order in any language that is written in Cyrillic and necessitates the use of lookup tables to perform sorting. 
These encodings are derived from ASCII on the base of some correspondence between Latin and Cyrillic (nearly phonetical), which was already used in Russian dialect of Morse code and in MTK-2 telegraph code.

The Roland D-50 is a polyphonic 61-key synthesizer produced by Roland.  It was released in 1987.  Its features include Linear Arithmetic synthesis, on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analog synthesis-styled layout design.  The external Roland PG-1000 Programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of sounds. It was also produced in a rack-mount variant design, the D-550, with almost 450 user-adjustable parameters."Roland D50", Sound On Sound, Jul 1997
The D-50's capabilities could be modified through the addition of 3rd-party products by Musitronics, most notably the M-EX which made the D-50 multitimbral (the D-50 was bi-timbral), as well as a chip that improved the D-50's response to incoming MIDI commands and a system for burning custom PCM cards with user samples for playback in the D-50.Mark Vail, Vintage Synthesizers, Miller Freeman, 1993, p. 63

Bronze race ([tpl]Lang-es|raza de bronce[/tpl]) is a term used by early 20th-century Latin American writers of the indigenista and americanista schools to refer to the mestizo population that arose in the Americas with the arrival of Latin European (particularly Spanish) colonists and their intermingling with the New World's Amerindian peoples.
Mexican poet Amado Nervo wrote "La Raza de Bronce" ("The Bronze Race") as an elegiac poem in honor of former president Benito Juárez in 1902. Bolivian indigenista  writer Alcides Arguedas used the term in his 1919 work, La Raza de Bronce, a study of the natives of the Andean altiplano. It was later used by Mexican luminary José Vasconcelos in La Raza Cósmica (1925).
The term was revived in the 1960s by Chicano ethnic group MEChA to refer to Latinos in the United States and the people in Mexico as a unified "race", similar to the black and white races. In this sense it is largely synonymous to the notion of the Chicano nation. The decision to call it a separate "race" may have been influenced by the contemporary negative views of "ethnic" or "nation" based nationalism and positive views of "race" based nationalism. The notion was first enunciated in the Plan Espiritual de Aztlan document.

[[Robert Kelker-Kelly]]

CATEGORIES: American male soap opera actors, 1964 births, Living people, Male actors from Kansas

Robert Kelker-Kelly (born April 18, 1964) is an American soap opera actor.
He attended Wichita Collegiate School in Wichita, Kansas from 1977 to 1980, where he was active in the theatre and had major roles in several plays, including Rusty in Guys and Dolls, Bill Sikes in Oliver! and Sir Lionel in Camelot.  He briefly attended the University of Kansas but decided to forgo college in favor of pursuing his acting career.  His initial daytime role was as Sam Fowler on the soap opera Another World, a role he originally played from 1987 to 1990. The character of Sam was involved in a front-burner story with rich socialite Amanda Cory.
In 1992, Kelker-Kelly was chosen to portray Bo Brady, an established role on Days of our Lives that was being vacated by the creator of the role, actor Peter Reckell. Although Kelker-Kelly was a recast, fans accepted his portrayal of Bo.  The character's pairing with Hope Brady (Kristian Alfonso) and reformed bad girl Billie Reed (Lisa Rinna) was a popular storyline and garnered Kelker-Kelly his widest audience. He was replaced by Peter Reckell in May 1995. In 1996 he returned to Another World playing a the new role of professional race car driver, Bobby Reno. In a convoluted storyline, Bobby was later found to be Dr. Shane Roberts. He played the dual roles until 1998. Later, he portrayed Stavros Cassadine on General Hospital in 2001, with guest spots in 2002, 2003 and 2013.
From 2002-2003 he was an acting teacher at the Pioneer Valley Performing Arts Charter High School (PVPA), in Hadley, Massachusetts (currently in South Hadley).
He is married to actress Miriam Parrish and is currently a Flight Instructor at Spirit of St. Louis Airport and Creve Coeur Airport in Missouri.Kelker Kelly at imdb.com
In April 2013, he briefly re-joined General Hospital as Stavros Cassadine a character he has played previously in 2001.

thumb|375px|Norfolk County in Massachusetts and New Hampshire (created in 1643 part of Massachusetts Bay Colony) had six towns shown in red and black. This is overlaid on a map of present-day MA and NH town borders in white.Norfolk County, Massachusetts Colony was one of the original four counties created in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The land was originally granted as separate from Massachusetts, but boundary disputes among the settlers led to their petitioning to join the colonial government to the south. The county was created by the Massachusetts General Court on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered "that the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four sheires". Norfolk County contained the settlements of Salisbury, Hampton, Haverhill, Exeter, Dover, and Portsmouth.Davis, William T. Bench and Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, p. 44. The Boston History Company, 1895. It effectively encompassed all settlements from the Merrimack River, north to the Piscataqua River, and extending inland about a dozen miles.  In 1680, the Province of New Hampshire was formally separated from Massachusetts, with Norfolk County forming the core. Massachusetts retained the northern bank of Merrimack River and the towns of Salisbury and Haverhill were added to Essex County.  Hampton, Exeter, Dover, and Portsmouth were governed at two levels, town and province/colony, until 1769, when New Hampshire was itself divided into counties, so that Norfolk ceased to exist.
The former Norfolk County is often referred to as "Old Norfolk County." 
Four volumes of records of the Old Norfolk County exist and are at the Essex County Registry of Deeds in Salem. They have been electronically imaged into JPG image files but are not yet online.  These four record books were also abstracted by Sidney Perley in The Essex Antiquarian. This magazine (published 1897 to 1911) has also been electronically imaged and some volumes are available at Google Books.
A new, unrelated county was established as Norfolk County, Massachusetts from most of the southern portion of Suffolk County in 1793.

The red-brick Gooderham Building  is a historic landmark of Toronto, Ontario, Canada located at 49 Wellington Street East. On the eastern edge of the city's Financial District (east of Yonge Street), it is in the St. Lawrence neighbourhood wedged between Front Street and Wellington Street, where they join up to form a triangular intersection. Completed in 1892, it was an early example of a prominent flatiron building. 
The Gooderham Building is the focal point of one of Toronto's most iconic vistas: looking west down Front Street towards the building's prominent rounded corner, framed on the sides by the heritage commercial blocks along Front Street, and with the skyscrapers of the Financial District towering in the background. The CN Tower is also visible from certain angles behind Brookfield Place. This vista frequently appears in imagery of the city.

Dulce de leche ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈdulse ðe ˈletʃe|pron[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-pt|doce de leite[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈdosi dʒi ˈlejtʃi|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈdose de ˈlejte|[/tpl]) is a confection prepared by slowly heating sweetened milk to create a product that derives its taste from the caramelization of the product, changing flavor and color.  Literally translated, it means "candy of milk" or "candy made of milk", "milk candy", or "milk jam" in the same way that dulce de frutilla is strawberry jam. It is popular in South America, notably in Mexico, Paraguay, Peru,  Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia and Venezuela. The dulce de leche of El Salvador has a soft, crumbly texture, with an almost crystallized form. In Colombia and Venezuela it's known as "Arequipe". A Mexican version called cajeta is made from goat's milk. In the Dominican Republic it is made with equal parts milk and sugar with cinnamon, and the texture is more like fudge. In Puerto Rico dulce de leche is sometimes made with unsweetened coconut milk.
A French version, known as confiture de lait, is very similar to the spreadable forms of dulce de leche. 
The Norwegian HaPå spread is a commercial variant that is thicker and less sweet. The name is an abbreviation of "Hamar" where it originally was made and "Pålegg"(spread). "Ha på" literally means "put on" as a reference to putting it on a slice of bread. HaPå originated during the Second World War when, due to the scarcity of supplies, housewives would boil Viking-melk (a type of condensed milk) to a very similar type of spread. After the war the production was commercialized and continues to this day.

A war hawk, or simply hawk for short, is a term used in politics for someone favoring war in a debate over whether to go to war, or whether to continue or escalate an existing war. War hawks are the opposite of war doves.  The terms derive from analogy with birds: hawks are predators that attack and eat other animals, whereas doves mostly eat seeds and fruit and historically symbolize peace.

Devonshire County, Massachusetts was a short-lived county formed in 1674 during colonial territorial disputes between the Province of Massachusetts and the Province of New York.  The county existed from 1674 to 1675, and encompassed land claimed by Massachusetts between the Kennebec River and Penobscot Bay in what is now Maine.  This overlapped the New York claim, which extended from the Kennebec to the Saint Croix River (Maine's present easternmost boundary).  Settlements in the territory were attacked during King Philip's War (1675-1676) and the area was abandoned.

CATEGORIES: Skyscrapers in Trinidad and Tobago, Port of Spain, Twin towers

Eric Williams Plaza, also known as the Eric Williams Financial Complex, located on Independence Square, Port of Spain, is the tallest building in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as in the English-speaking Caribbean. It consists of a pair of skyscrapers 22 stories high and 302 ft (92 m) tall, locally known as the "Twin Towers". Construction on the complex started in 1979 and ended in 1986. The complex was officially opened on March 29, 1986. The architect who managed the construction was Anthony C. Lewis Partnership.
The Eric Williams Plaza was named after Eric Williams, the first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago. The first tower houses the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago while the second tower houses the Ministry of Finance. The first tower's official name is Eric Williams Financial Tower and the second tower's official name is the Central Bank Tower. The building  surrounding the towers is the old Central Bank. The old Central Bank building has gold and currency vaults, administrative areas, an auditorium and a concert hall. It is one of the finest facilities in the country. It is also part of the complex. Both towers contain building security, communications, and life-safety systems.
The towers have an earthquake resistant design. The cross braces and core walls in both towers are designed to take earthquake forces with the former taking 15% of the forces and the latter taking 85%. Additionally, great care was taken in the detailing of the reinforcement.
The thickness of the basement under each tower is 25'. The pile cap under each tower is a cellular raft which is a combination of 9' x 6' beams and an 18" slab. Water storage for the complex is located in the basements of the towers.
The building is located on the Brian Lara Promenade, Independence Square (formerly Marine Square) in downtown Port of Spain.  It was the tallest building in Trinidad and Tobago until the Nicholas Tower was constructed by businessman Issa Nicholas.  
From 1993 to January of 1999, the office of the Prime Minister was housed here;  in 1999 it was returned to the Whitehall.

Willy Wonka is a character in Roald Dahl's 1964 children's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, its sequel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, and the film adaptations of these books that followed. The book and the film adaptations both vividly depict an odd Wonka, a feature arising from his creative and eccentric genius. He bewilders the other characters with his antics, but Charlie enjoys Wonka's behavior. In the 2005 film adaptation, Willy Wonka's behavior is viewed more as a (sympathetic) character flaw. Wonka's reasons for giving away his fabulous factory is never revealed in the books, but in the 1971 film adaptation, Wonka tells Charlie he can't live forever, so he wanted to find a sweet child he could trust his candy making secrets to.

The  Treaty of Fort Laramie (also called the Sioux Treaty of 1868) was an agreement between the United States and the Oglala, Miniconjou, and Brulé bands of  Lakota people, Yanktonai Dakota, and Arapaho Nation"Fort Laramie Treaty, 1868." Archives of the West. (retrieved 19 Dec 2010) signed in 1868 at Fort Laramie in the Wyoming Territory, guaranteeing to the Lakota ownership of the Black Hills, and further land and hunting rights in South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana.  The Powder River Country was to be henceforth closed to all whites. The treaty ended Red Cloud's War.
In the treaty, the U.S. included all Ponca lands in the Great Sioux Reservation. Conflict between the Ponca and the Sioux/Lakota, who now claimed the land as their own by U.S. law, forced the U.S. to remove the Ponca from their own ancestral lands in Nebraska to poor land in Oklahoma.
The treaty includes an article intended to "ensure the civilization" of the Lakota, financial incentives for them to farm land and become competitive, and stipulations that minors should be provided with an "English education" at a "mission building." To this end the U.S. government included in the treaty that white teachers, blacksmiths, a farmer, a miller, a carpenter, an engineer and a government agent should take up residence within the reservation.
Repeated violations of the otherwise exclusive rights to the land by gold prospectors led to the Black Hills War. Migrant workers seeking gold had crossed the reservation borders, in violation of the treaty. Indians had assaulted these gold prospectors, in violation of the treaty, and war ensued. The U.S. government seized the Black Hills land in 1877.
More than a century later, the Sioux nation won a victory in court. On June 30, 1980, in United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians,[tpl]ussc|source=f|448|371|1980[/tpl] the United States Supreme Court upheld an award of $15.5 million for the market value of the land in 1877, along with 103 years worth of interest at 5 percent, for an additional $105 million. The Lakota Sioux, however, refused to accept payment and instead demanded the return of their territory from the United States. 
In more recent proceedings the U.S. Courts have seen that some of the monies associated with the claim have been expended and, as such, claim that the agreement is valid. In fact, several thousand tribal members have filed for and are awaiting for a final decision by the Court to decide to issue the resources to tribal members.[tpl]cn|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The treaty and its aftermath is the subject of a 1986 video by the Native American Public Broadcasting Consortium.

The Pensacola Pelicans were a minor league baseball team based in Pensacola, Florida. In various incarnations, they played in three different independent baseball leagues (leagues unaffiliated with Major League Baseball) from 2002–2010. They played their games at Pelican Park.http://www.pnj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009904240326 
The initial incarnations Pelicans began play in 2002 as charter members of the new, independent Southeastern League. The league folded after the 2003 season, and team owner Quint Studer purchased a franchise in the Central Baseball League, moving the Pelicans to the new organization.

Deutschland was the lead ship of her class of heavy cruisers (often termed a pocket battleship) which served with the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany during World War II. Ordered by the Weimar government for the Reichsmarine, she was laid down at the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel in February 1929 and completed by April 1933. Originally classified as an armored ship (Panzerschiff) by the Reichsmarine, in February 1940 the Germans reclassified the remaining two ships of this class as heavy cruisers.[tpl]efn|name=Graf Spee[/tpl] In 1940, she was renamed Lützow, after the Admiral Hipper class heavy cruiser [tpl]ship|German cruiser|Lützow|1939|2[/tpl] was handed over to the Soviet Union.
The ship saw significant action with the Kriegsmarine, including several non-intervention patrols, during which she was attacked by Republican bombers in the Spanish Civil War. At the outbreak of World War II, she was cruising the North Atlantic, prepared to attack Allied merchant traffic. Bad weather hampered her efforts, and she only sank or captured a handful of vessels before returning to Germany. She then participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway. Damaged at the Battle of Drøbak Sound, she was recalled to Germany for repairs. While en route, she was torpedoed and seriously damaged by a British submarine.
Repairs were completed by March 1941, Lützow returned to Norway to join the forces arrayed against Allied shipping to the Soviet Union. She ran aground during a planned attack on convoy PQ 17, which necessitated another return to Germany for repairs. She next saw action at the Battle of the Barents Sea with the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper, which ended with a failure to destroy the convoy JW 51B. Engine problems forced a series of repairs culminating in a complete overhaul at the end of 1943, after which the ship remained in the Baltic. Sunk in the Kaiserfahrt in April 1945 by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, Lützow was used as a gun battery to support German troops fighting the Soviet Army until 4 May 1945, when she was disabled by her crew. Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was subsequently sunk as a target in the Baltic.

[[Jean Picard]]
CATEGORIES: 1620 births, 1682 deaths, People from La Flèche, French astronomers, Geodesists, Roman Catholic cleric–scientists

Jean-Félix Picard (21 July 1620 – 12 July 1682) was a French astronomer and priest born in La Flèche, where he studied at the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand. He died in Paris, France. He was the first person to measure the size of the Earth to a reasonable degree of accuracy in a survey conducted in 1669–70, for which he is honored with a pyramid at Juvisy-sur-Orge. Guided by Maurolycus's methodology and Snellius's mathematics for doing so, Picard achieved this by measuring one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using triangulation along thirteen triangles stretching from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens. His measurements produced a result of 110.46 km for one degree of latitude, which gives a corresponding terrestrial radius of 6328.9 km. The polar radius has now been measured at just over 6357 km. This was an error only 0.44% less than the modern value. This was another example of advances in astronomy and its tools making possible advances in cartography. Picard was the first to attach a telescope with crosswires (developed by William Gascoigne) to a quadrant, and one of the first to use a micrometer screw on his instruments. The quadrant he used to determine the size of the Earth had a radius of 38 inches and was graduated to quarter-minutes. The sextant he used to find the meridian had a radius of six feet, and was equipped with a micrometer to enable minute adjustments. These equipment improvements made the margin of error only ten seconds, as opposed to Tycho Brahe's four minutes of error. This made his measurements 24 times as accurate. Isaac Newton was to use this value in his theory of universal gravitation.
Picard also travelled to Tycho Brahe's Danish observatory, Uraniborg, in order to assess its position accurately so that Tycho's readings could be compared to others.
Picard collaborated and corresponded with many scientists, including Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens, Ole Rømer, Rasmus Bartholin, Johann Hudde,[ref]Johann (or Jan) van Waveren Hudde (1628–1704), mayor of Amsterdam, mathematician, lens maker.  See:
Picard also developed what became the standard method for measuring the right ascension of a celestial object.[ref]Picard did not conceive the method of measuring a celestial body's right ascension by recording the time at which the body crossed the observer’s meridian. According to French astronomer Camille Guillaume Bigourdan (1851-1932), the French astronomers Adrien Auzout (1622-1691) and Jacques Buot (or Buhot) (In October 1669, Picard sent, to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, a report of his celestial observations during the preceding year, which included the observation of two bright stars, Regulus and Arcturus, while the sun was still in the sky. The report was recorded in the Registres des Procès-verbaux de l‘Académie des Sciences. On reading the report, it becomes apparent that Picard had been using clocks to determine the right ascension of stars. French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier (1715-1799) records an extract of Picard’s report and then remarks:
"Cette Observation est remarquable, étant inoüi qu'on eût jamais pris la Hauteur Méridienne des Etoiles fixes non seulment en plein Soleil, mais pas même encore dans la force du Crépuscle ; desorte qu'il est maintenant facile (continue M. Picard) de trouver immédiatement les Ascensions droites des Etoiles fixes non seulment par les Horloges à Pendule, mais aussi par l'Observation du Vertical du Soleil au mème temps qu'on observera la hauteur Méridienne d'une Etoile fixe."
(This observation is remarkable, it being unheard of that one has ever taken the meridian altitude of fixed stars not only in full sun, but still not in the force of twilight; so it is now easy (continues Mr. Picard) to find immediately the right ascensions of the fixed stars not only by pendulum clocks but also by observation of the vertical of the sun at the same time that one observes the meridian altitude of a fixed star.) Le Monnier, Histoire céleste, ou Recueil de toutes les observations astronomiques faites par ordre du Roi … (Paris, France:  Briasson, 1741), page 40.
[/ref]Wolf, Abraham, A History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, vol. 2 (London, England:  George Allen and Unwin, 1950), page 172. In this method, the observer records the time at which the object crosses the observer's meridian. Picard made his observations using the precision pendulum clock that Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens had recently developed.
His book "Mesure de la Terre" was published in 1671.
There is a lunar crater named after Picard, on the southwest quadrant of Mare Crisium.
The PICARD mission, an orbiting solar observatory, is named after Picard.

Richard Wilkins III (commonly referred to as The Mayor) is a fictional character in the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003). Portrayed by Harry Groener, he is the mayor of Sunnydale, a fictional town rife with vampires and demons in which the main character, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) lives. The premise of the series is that Buffy is a Slayer, a young girl endowed with superhuman powers to fight evil, which she accomplishes with the help of a small group of friends and family, called the Scooby Gang. During the second season it becomes apparent that local authorities are aware of the endemic evil in the town, and either ignore it or are complicit in making it worse. The series regularly employs monsters and elements of horror to symbolize real problems,Wilcox, p. 18. and the abuse of power in relation to the forces of darkness is a repeated theme throughout the series, as well as in its spinoff Angel.South, p. 66.  The third season reveals that the Mayor is involved in many of the evil occurrences and he becomes the primary villain, or Big Bad. His genial demeanor, promotion of family values, casual phobia of germs, and dislike of swearing belie his evil nature.
This season also marks Buffy's and her friends' last year in high school, and introduces a long-running character named Faith (Eliza Dushku), who is also a Slayer. Faith's disrupted and painful family life has left her without a stable moral center, and unlike Buffy, she is particularly vulnerable to the dark impulses associated with being a Slayer. After many months of fighting alongside Buffy and being under the authority of Buffy's Watcher, Giles, Faith becomes estranged from Buffy and aligns herself with the Mayor, who both employs her as an assassin and becomes a father figure to her while preparing to become a powerful demon that will destroy the town.

[[Maury Island]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms of King County, Washington, Islands of Washington (state), Landforms of Puget Sound

Maury Island is a small island in Puget Sound in the U.S. state of Washington. It is connected to Vashon Island by an isthmus built by local homeowners in 1913. Before construction of the isthmus, the island was connected to Vashon only during low tide.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The island is rural with large areas of excellent farmland, forest, and relatively undeveloped shoreline. Currently, environmental issues on the island are under considerable scrutiny.
Maury Island was named during the Wilkes Expedition[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] in honor of William Lewis Maury,[ref]
</ref> who between 1863 and 1864 raided Union ships on behalf of the Confederacy and is buried in Caroline County, Virginia.<ref>
</ref> It was the site of the [[Maury Island incident]], an unusual case of an alleged encounter with a [[unidentified flying object|UFO]].
Point Robinson Light is located on Point Robinson, the easternmost point on Maury Island.
Maury and Vashon Islands are home to the Vashon-Maury Island Community Council. In the 1940s, Vashon had a chamber of commerce that acted more like a community council than a traditional chamber. By the 1950s, the precursor to today's community council was organized and called itself the "Civic Assembly." Today, the Community Council is charged with working to preserve the rural nature of Vashon and Maury Islands.
Maury Island also is the center of controversy between the locals and Glacier Northwest, a company that supplies ready-mixed concrete owned by the Taiheiyo Cement Company of Japan. The company intends a 300-fold expansion of their existing gravel mine on the island, which is currently permitted to extract up to 20,000 tons per year. With the expansion, the company would have gained the capability to extract up to 40,000 tons per day, an incredibly significant increase from state allowed levels. The opposition group made up of local islanders is known as Preserve Our Islands and staunchly advocates gathering more information before continuing mining operations on the island.  The affected shoreline is located within the state's only existing aquatic preserve for notably diverse marine ecosystems.  The company's project website provides additional information on the project and how it will be conducted.  Opponents of the mine dispute many of the claims made by Glacier Northwest and allege that the project will severely impact sensitive shoreline habitat http://www.preserveourislands.org.
On December 30, 2010 King County took possession of the land, including the keys to the property gate.
The council adopted King County Executive Dow Constantine's proposed purchase and sale of the property on December 6, including the adoption of his financing package.
The King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks will now work with the community to improve the property for public open space, while restoring the ecological habitat for wildlife. The mile of shoreline that is part of the purchase is the longest undeveloped stretch of shore in King County, and will be a critical part of the region's wildlife habitat for fish, birds and Puget Sound marine life.

Arthur Stanley Wint OD MBE (25 May 1920 – 19 October 1992) was the first Jamaican Olympic gold medalist, winning the 400 m at 1948 Summer Olympics.
Arthur Wint, known as the Gentle Giant, was born in Plowden, Manchester, Jamaica. While at Calabar High School, he ran the sprints and did both the high jump and long jump. He later transferred to Excelsior High School and finished his secondary education there.  In 1937 he was the Jamaica Boy Athlete of the year, the following year he won a gold medal in the 800 m at the Central American Games in Panama.
In 1942 he joined the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and set the Canadian 400 m record while training there. He was sent to Britain for active combat during World War II as a pilot. He left the Royal Air Force in 1947 to attend St Bartholomew's Hospital as a medical student.
In 1948 Wint won Jamaica’s first Olympic gold for the 400 m (46.2) in London, beating his team-mate Herb McKenley. In 800 m he won silver after American Mal Whitfield. He probably missed his third medal in London Games by pulling a muscle in the 4 x 400 m relay final.
In Helsinki 1952 he was part of the historic team setting the world record while capturing the gold in 4 x 400 m relay. He also won silver in 800 m, again coming second to Mal Whitfield.
He ran his final race in 1953 at Wembley Stadium, finished his internship, graduated as a doctor and the following year he was made a Member of the British Empire (MBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1955 Wint returned to Jamaica eventually settling in Hanover as the only resident doctor in the parish. In 1973 he was awarded the Jamaica honour of the Order of Distinction. He served as Jamaica's High Commissioner to Britain and ambassador to Sweden and Denmark from 1974 to 1978. He was inducted in the Black Athlete’s Hall of Fame in the US (1977), the Jamaica Sports Hall of Fame (1989) and the Central American & Caribbean Athletic Confederation Hall of Fame (2003).
Arthur Wint died on Heroes Day in Linstead, aged 72.

The Maury Island Incident refers to claims made by Fred Crisman and Harold Dahl of falling debris and threats by men in black following sightings of unidentified flying objects in the sky over Maury Island in Puget Sound in June 1947. Dahl later retracted his claims, stating the story was a hoax. 
Crisman and Dahl said they were harbor patrolmen on a workboat who saw six doughnut shaped objects in the sky near Maury Island. According to Crisman and Dahl, one of the objects dropped a substance that resembled lava or "white metal" onto their boat, breaking a worker's arm and killing a dog.

[[Cutter John]]
CATEGORIES: Bloom County characters, Fictional Vietnam War veterans, Comics characters introduced in 1981

Cutter John is a fictional character in the 1980s comic strip Bloom County by Berke Breathed. 
Cutter, a wheelchair-user and Vietnam War veteran was one of the county's most well-liked citizens. Despite being somewhat childish and awkward at times, he was very popular with the ladies, particularly schoolteacher Bobbi Harlow. Cutter also was a good friend to many of the animal characters of Bloom County, often role-playing Star Trek with them (using his wheelchair as the "Enterpoop").
Cutter claims he was injured outside Quang-Tri in 1969, in a booby-trapped tunnel.  He says that three of his buddies risked their lives to save him. Because he was inside a tunnel, he probably was a tunnel rat during the war.
In one story arc, he and Opus the Penguin were lost at sea (after Oliver Wendell Jones had converted Cutter's wheelchair into a helium balloon) while attempting to cause havoc at the South African embassy in Washington, D.C. (their goal was to turn the South African ambassador black).
Having blown off course and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, Cutter was captured by a Soviet submarine and held as a spy. Opus developed amnesia during the incident and found his way back to the Bloom Boardinghouse, and told everyone what had happened once his memory returned. Eventually Cutter was traded for Bill the Cat, who had apparently been moonlighting as a spy. He appeared much less often after that. In one Sunday strip, it is revealed that "Cutter John's" true name is Cutter Jeff. He prefers to be called Cutter John, though.
Cutter John is one of Breathed's oldest characters, first appearing in The Academia Waltz. (In those days his name was given as "Saigon John" and his war injury is described as taking a shot (presumably friendly fire) while smoking a bong (improvised from his M16) with a North Vietnamese soldier, making his tunnel rat story presumably a retcon.) His more familiar name is most likely a reference to Trapper John McIntyre from M*A*S*H.  While a major character in the first half of Bloom County 's nine-year run, his role was reduced to only occasional cameos for the remainder of that strip and its immediate spin-off, Outland.  In the commentary in one of the Bloom County collections, Breathed observed that he dropped Cutter John from the strip because it was too artistically challenging and "frustrating" to draw someone sitting down in every panel of the comic. According to Breathed, a wheelchair-using fan of the strip, upon hearing this observation, said Breathed "ought to try sitting in a wheelchair himself for real frustration". 
His sole appearance in Breathed's last strip, Opus, comes in a one-panel cameo, alongside Bill the Cat, Michael Binkley, Milo Bloom, and Oliver Wendell Jones,  when Steve Dallas "flashes back" and sees them shortly before going to see Opus in the Animal Shelter in the strip's final storyline. This makes Cutter the second character (after Dallas) to appear in all four of Breathed's comics.

The Bihu dance ([tpl]lang-as|বিহু নৃত্য[/tpl], [tpl]lang-hi|बिहू नृत्य[/tpl]) is a folk dance from the Indian state of Assam related to the festival of Bihu.   This joyous dance is performed by both young men and women, and is characterized by brisk dance steps,and rapid hand movement. Dancers wear traditionally colorful Assamese clothing.
Though the origins of the Bihu dance is unknown, the first official endorsement is cited to be when Ahom king Rudra Singha invited Bihu dancers to perform at the Ranghar fields sometime around 1694[tpl]harvcol|TOI|2011|[/tpl] on the occasion of Rongali Bihu.

[[Christian politics in New Zealand]]
CATEGORIES: Christian interfaith and secular relations, Politics of New Zealand, Christian politics, Christianity in New Zealand, Conservatism in New Zealand

This article discusses Christian politics in New Zealand, particularly socially conservative and evangelical Christian politics. Although slightly over half of New Zealand's population belong, at least nominally, to Christian denominations,[ref]
QuickStats About Culture and Identity - Statistics New Zealand[/ref] debate can take place over the extent to which Christianity affects New Zealand politics.
At one end of the spectrum many dismiss the effects of Christianity, saying that New Zealand society has always had a largely secular character. At the other end of the spectrum, however, many evangelicals, fundamentalists and conservative Catholics see Christianity as underlying New Zealand's entire political system. During the nineteenth century, many church-oriented bodies sponsored and fostered several of the original European settlement-ventures in the period 1840–1850, notably the settlements of Otago (1848, Free Church of Scotland) and Canterbury (1850, Church of England). On the other hand, a notable politician of the late 19th century, Sir Robert Stout, had a considerable reputation as a freethinker.
Christianity has had a role in the major [tpl]As of|2007|alt= contemporary[/tpl] political parties, although it has never (unlike in some European countries) formed an explicit part of them. Religious elements in these parties have taken varying forms, and cannot easily be classified as a single movement. One can much more readily examine the Christian conservative strand that arose in the 1970s and 1980s, mostly in reaction to a perceived decline of social standards. This movement contributed to the founding of Christian political parties such as Christian Heritage, the Christian Democrats, the Christian Coalition and Destiny New Zealand. The political aspect of Māori Christianity, such as the Ratana movement, also merits attention.

[[Dupin cyclide]]
CATEGORIES: Surfaces

In mathematics, a Dupin cyclide or cyclide of Dupin is any geometric inversion of a standard torus, cylinder or double cone. In particular, these latter are themselves examples of Dupin cyclides. They were discovered by (and named after) Charles Dupin in his 1803 dissertation under Gaspard Monge.[tpl]Harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|2000[/tpl] The key property of a Dupin cyclide is that it is a channel surface (envelope of a one parameter family of spheres) in two different ways. This property means that Dupin cyclides are natural objects in Lie sphere geometry.
Dupin cyclides are often simply known as "cyclides", but the latter term is also used to refer to a more general class of quartic surfaces which are important in the theory of separation of variables for the Laplace equation in three dimensions.

In 2003, Ruben van Wendel de Joode, Hans de Bruijn, and Michel van Eeten published a paper titled Protecting the Virtual Commons: Self-organizing Open Source Communities and Innovative Intellectual Property Regimes. The introduction of the paper begins by establishing that the open source and free software virtual communities of the Internet are unique virtual communities; unlike others, they have been popular for a long time and have had significant economic impact. Further, the introduction contrasts open source and free software development to proprietary computer software development.
The paper was then published as a book titled Protecting the Virtual Commons : Self-Organizing Open Source and Free Software Communities and Innovative Intellectual Property Regimes.

[[Ruled surface]]
CATEGORIES: Surfaces, Differential geometry, Differential geometry of surfaces, Complex surfaces, Algebraic surfaces, Geometric shapes, Analytic geometry

In geometry, a surface S is ruled (also called a scroll) if through every point of S there is a straight line that lies on S.  The most familiar examples (illustrated here in three-dimensional Euclidean space) are the plane and the curved surface of a cylinder or cone.  Other examples are a conical surface with elliptical directrix, the right conoid, the helicoid, and the tangent developable of a smooth curve in space.  
A ruled surface can always be described (at least locally) as the set of points swept by a  moving straight line.  For example, a cone is formed by keeping one point of a line fixed whilst moving another point along a circle.
A surface is doubly ruled if through every one of its points there are two distinct lines that lie on the surface.  The hyperbolic paraboloid and the hyperboloid of one sheet are doubly ruled surfaces. The plane is the only surface which contains at least three distinct lines through each of its points. 
The properties of being ruled or doubly ruled are preserved by projective maps, and therefore are concepts of projective geometry. In algebraic geometry ruled surfaces are sometimes considered to be surfaces in affine or projective space over a field, but they are also sometimes considered as abstract algebraic surfaces without an embedding into affine or projective space, in which case "straight line" is understood to mean an affine or projective line.

Recreational fishing, also called sport fishing, is fishing for pleasure or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is fishing for profit, or subsistence fishing, which is fishing for survival. 
The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits. Other devices, commonly referred to as terminal tackle, are also used to affect or complement the presentation of the bait to the targeted fish. Some examples of terminal tackle include weights, floats, and swivels. Lures are frequently used in place of bait. Some hobbyists make handmade tackle themselves, including plastic lures and artificial flies. The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is known as angling. 
Big-game fishing is conducted from boats to catch large open-water species such as tuna, sharks and marlin. Noodling and trout tickling are also recreational activities.

The foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan, known in Japanese as oyatoi gaikokujin (Kyūjitai: [tpl]lang|ja-hant|御雇ひ外國人[/tpl], Shinjitai: [tpl]lang|ja|御雇い外国人[/tpl], "hired foreigners"), were those foreign advisors hired by the Japanese government for their specialized knowledge to assist in the modernization of Japan at the end of the Bakufu and during the Meiji period. The term  is sometimes rendered o-yatoi gaikokujin in romaji. The total number is uncertain, but is estimated to have reached more than 3,000 (with thousands more in the private sector). Until 1899, more than 800 hired foreign experts continued to be employed by the government, and many others were employed privately; despite the term experts however, some were simply convenient hires who happened to be in the treaty ports such as Yokohama and Kobe.
The goal in hiring the foreign advisors was to obtain transfers of technology and advice on systems and cultural ways. The foreign advisors were highly paid; in 1874, they numbered 520 men, at which time their salaries came to ¥2.272 million, or 33.7 percent of the national annual budget. Despite the value they provided in the modernization of Japan, the Japanese government did not consider it prudent for them to settle in Japan permanently. After training Japanese replacements to take over their places, many found that their contracts (typically for three years) were not renewed. Some however made their lives in Japan for example Josiah Conder and Thomas Blake Glover. 
Some foreign advisors supplemented their activities as government employees by undertaking Christian missionary activities. 
The system was officially terminated in 1899 when extraterritoriality came to an end in Japan. Nevertheless similar employment of foreigners persists in Japan, particularly within the national education system and professional sports.

Mount Bogong [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|ɡ|ɒ|ŋ[/tpl], located in the Alpine National Park, is the highest mountain in Victoria, Australia, at [tpl]convert|1986|m[/tpl]. The Big River separates the massif of the mountain from the Bogong High Plains to the south. "Bogong" in the local Aboriginal language means bigfella[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]. From the nearby town of Mount Beauty to its summit, Mount Bogong rises more than [tpl]convert|1600|m|ft[/tpl],[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] thus making it one of the highest peaks in Australia not only in terms of its elevation above sea level, but also in terms of actual base-to-summit prominence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Mount Bogong is a popular backcountry skiing mountain through winter but only has snow for the mid winter-spring months. It is around [tpl]convert|30|km|mi[/tpl] by road and walking track or [tpl]convert|12|km|mi[/tpl] direct to Mount Beauty. Falls Creek and Mount Hotham ski resorts are also nearby.

The Boardwalk Hotel and Casino was a Coney Island style hotel located on the Las Vegas Strip. It was owned and operated by MGM Mirage.  It was part of the Holiday Inn hotel chain but left after being acquired by Mirage Resorts. It was built before the era of the mega-casinos, and with 654 rooms was relatively small compared to many properties in its vicinity.
Most visitors to Las Vegas would argue the best feature of the Boardwalk was the location on the "Strip": in between the plush Bellagio and the Monte Carlo and across from the Paris, Aladdin and MGM Grand.  
The hotel's Coney Island theme could be seen in its facade with an original 1906 parachute jump ride and a faux wooden roller coaster. The hotel was composed of three distinct buildings all built at different times.  The newest building was the 16-story tower built in 1996.  The Steeplechase building was 6 stories and the Luna Park building was the original four-story structure when the hotel first opened.

His 1971 book Journeys Out of the Body is credited with popularizing the term "out-of-body experience". 
Monroe achieved world-wide recognition as an explorer of human consciousness. His research, beginning in the 1950s, produced evidence that specific sound patterns have identifiable, beneficial effects on our capabilities. For example, certain combinations of frequencies appeared to enhance alertness; others to induce sleep; and still others to evoke expanded states of consciousness.
Assisted by specialists in psychology, medicine, biochemistry, psychiatry, electrical engineering, physics, and education, Robert Monroe developed Hemi-Sync, a patented audio technology that is claimed to facilitate enhanced performance.Monroe, Robert A (1977) "Journeys Out of the Body", Anchor Press, ISBN 0-385-00861-9Russell Ronald (2007) "The Journey of Robert Monroe: From Out-Of-Body Explorer to Consciousness Pioneer", Hampton Roads Publishing, ISBN 1-57174-533-5Stockton Bayard (1989) "Catapult: The Biography of Robert A.

The Leyland P76 is a large car that was produced by Leyland Australia, the Australian subsidiary of British Leyland. Featuring what was described at the time as the "standard Australian wheelbase of 111 inches", it was intended to provide the company with a genuine rival to large local models like the Ford Falcon, the Holden Kingswood, and the Chrysler Valiant.
Launched in 1973, the P76 was nicknamed "the wedge", on account of its shape, with a large boot, able to easily hold a 44 gallon drum. Although station wagon and "Force 7" coupé versions were designed, these never went into mass production.

Eucalyptus delegatensis, commonly known as alpine ash, gum-topped stringybark, and white-top, is a sub-alpine or temperate tree of southeastern Australia. A straight, grey-trunked tree, it reaches heights of over 90 metres in suitable conditions. The tallest currently known specimen is located in Tasmania and is 87.9 m tall.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gianttrees.com.au | title = Giant Trees[/tpl]  This height is sufficient to make it the 10th tallest species of tree. Among eucalypts, only Eucalyptus regnans grows taller.
Alpine ash is a member of the Stringybark Group of eucalypts. The bark is thick, fibrous, and woolly at the base and smooth on the smaller branches. In the Tasmanian subspecies, the entire trunk and the larger limbs are thick-barked. In the mainland subspecies the rough bark extends only part-way up the trunk. 
The nominate subspecies is native to cool, rocky, rugged well drained soils of mountainous areas between 850m and 1500 m in Victoria and New South Wales; E. d. tasmaniensis is found in most higher-altitude parts of Tasmania apart from the south-west.
Alpine ash requires very high rainfall by Australian standards — over 1200mm (47 inches) per year and snow or frosts during the winter months. It is an important tree for the timber industry, often grouped with mountain ash and messmate stringybark and sometimes sold as "Vic Ash", "Victorian Ash", or "Tasmanian Oak". 
Alpine ash often grows in naturally occurring pure stands and regenerates only from seed. While occasional fires do not severely impact alpine ash forest, repeated fires in the same area can destroy stands because it takes roughly twenty years for seedlings to reach sexual maturity.

The Roland MC-303 is the first of a series of musical instruments known as a Groovebox. It combines a simple sound module with a sequencer to record and store notation, along with controls aimed at encouraging the musician to improvise the music while it is playing. Despite the number in its name and the hype it received at its launch, the MC-303 has more in common with other MC prefixed synthesizers (such as the Roland MC-202), which contain built-in sequencers, than it does with the famous Roland TB-303. As the first Groovebox, the MC-303 was the first in a line of inexpensive products specifically targeted towards house DJs and amateur home musicians rather than professional producers. It was superseded by the Roland MC-505. It is the predecessor to the Roland D2, Roland MC-307, Roland MC-909 and the Roland MC-808.

Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, which sits nearby, takes its name from the mountain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Kvernberget|title=Kvernberget|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl]
For a number of years, Kvernberget and the surrounding area have been popular for hiking and simple mountaineering activities, and the summit is Kristiansund's most popular hiking destination. From the summit, much of the Nordmøre district of Møre og Romsdal county may be seen in fair weather. A drinking water reservoir is located inside the mountain.[tpl]cite book|first=Karl Ragnar|last=Gjertsen|title=Storkvenna på Nordlandet|volume=1|series=Årbok for Nordmøre 1987|year=1987|location=Kristiansund|pages=5–12[/tpl]

[[Roland RE-201]]
CATEGORIES: Sound recording technology, Effects units

The Roland RE-201, commonly known as the Space Echo, is an audio analog delay effects unit produced by the Roland Corporation.
A tape echo device records incoming audio to a loop of magnetic tape, then replays the audio over a series of several playback heads before it is erased again by new incoming audio. The tape used in the RE-201 is the standard 1/4" tape of the open-reel variety, but made as one, continuous loop. In the Roland 'RE' range there are no reels of any kind, the tape is transported via a capstan drive. The tape loop is contained in a loose, constantly moving jumble in the tape chamber (also known as the tape tank) under a plastic panel which protects the tape and keeps it from getting tangled. The replacement tapes were known as Roland RT-1L replacement tape loops and sold by Roland.Roland RE-501 Owners Manual, page 4
There are several control dials on the device that alter such aspects as tape speed, repeat pattern (an 11-position rotary switch), one instrument and two microphone inputs, a single analog backlit VU meter for all three inputs, wet/dry mix for both echo and reverb, and intensity (number of repeats, in a sense; it actually reduces how much the erase/record head erases the tape), that can be adjusted to a user's liking; and bass/treble controls to EQ the sound of the repeats (not the dry signal), as well as dry and effected "Echo" output jacks with a switch for output setting (-10, -20, -35db levels.)
Used as a delay/echo, the Roland RE-201 is said to produce an unpredictable delay that is warm and gritty sounding. It is also capable of producing a large variety of its own sound effects, even without an input signal (by turning the intensity control to maximum and allowing the unit to self-regenerate, or self-oscillate, while manipulating the tape speed and other controls). 
Despite its age, the Roland RE-201 is widely sought after, and still used by many bands to this day, notably in the experimental work of Radiohead, and the rockabilly stylings of Brian Setzer, the latter using one recently to get the slapback sound sought after for rockabilly and such styles of music. The Roland RE-201 is also extensively used in modern electronic music.RA: Echospace: In your face ambient - Feature / Interview

[[Café Naturale]]

CATEGORIES: 2004 albums, Wendy Matthews albums

Café Naturale is the seventh studio album by singer Wendy Matthews released by BMG in Australia on 24 May 2004. It is an album of cover songs Matthews and the album's producer Michael Szumowski chose themselves. Matthews enjoyed recording this album and felt the songs came together naturally, she also felt she broke down some personal barriers. The album yielded only one single, "All I Need".
In 2002, Matthews moved to a coastal haven outside Coffs Harbour, New South Wales. She spent a lot of time in her favourite cafe listening to records and explains "there’s nothing like a song to bring you back to a specific moment or feeling in time.""Wendy Matthews - Australian Music Online profile". Amo.org.au. Retrieved 3 August 2009. This lead her to name the album Café Naturale. She was also surprised by some of the song choices. Matthews states "Once we got into the studio the record started to reveal its personality to me. It all came together and the songs, these very melodic songs, started to make themselves known. It just worked." Matthews believes this record seems charmed and she'd love for this record to play in someone’s favourite café and inspire a few memories.
The thought behind the album's cover artwork comes from a painting of a woman on a wall on Edgecliff Road in Sydney, Australia by Bruno Dutot in 1987. Matthews approached Dutot and she asked him to commission a painting of this woman for her cover. She states "basically, he's painted her as me with a chopstick in her hair and my dog at the feet. Every time I'm in Sydney I have to go and check the lady on the wall, what colour dress she's wearing this month, whether she's changed and she looks so cafe society to me, so I'm thrilled and honoured that he actually did a painting for this cover.""ARCHIVED WENDY NEWS - APRIL / AUGUST 2004".

Harald Kreutzberg (11 December 1902 – 25 April 1968) was a German dancer and choreographer.
Kreutzberg was born at Reichenberg/Liberec.  Trained at the Dresden Ballet School, he also studied dance with Mary Wigman and Rudolf Laban.
Beginning in 1927 he appeared in plays directed by Max Reinhardt and in 1929 went with Reinhardt to New York City. Kreutzberg then toured the U.S., Canada, and Europe with the dancer Yvonne Georgi.[ref]"Harald Kreutzberg".  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.
Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 16 May. 2012[/ref]
An important figure of the German modern dance, he founded a school in Bern in 1955. Its ballets combined the drama and humor, with an emphasis on inventive scenes. He died in Bern.http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t74.e12535
Kreutzberg made a rare appearance on television in the 1960s, when he was featured in the dual roles of Drosselmeyer and the Snow King, in a heavily abridged German-American  co-production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. It was shown in the U.S. in 1965 by CBS,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221445/ and repeated several times afterward, but eventually superseded by the nearly full-length Baryshnikov version in 1977.
From 1932-1936, Kreutzberg, along with his partner Ruth Page, created a new and unlikely partnership. Kreutzberg was a German modern dancer, while Page was an American ballerina. They first performed together on 25 February 1933 in Chicago. This partnership helped Kreutzberg perform his solo acts in other venues, which is what people really enjoyed watching him do. Kreutzberg’s performances were described as including everything from strong actions to flowing movements and even some pantomime. His jumps were very energetic and strong, but yet his body movements were very soft and fluttery. He was known as not just a talented ballet and modern dancer, but as an entertainer.Meglin, Joellen A.

The profile uses Web Services Description Language (WSDL) to enable the description of services as sets of endpoints operating on messages.
To understand the importance of WSI-BP, note that it defines a much narrower set of valid services than the full WSDL or SOAP schema. Many common platforms (listed below) support WSI-BP but do not support services outside of it. Compare the WSDL 1.1 specification to the subset permitted in WSI-BP.

[/ref]) is a former Soviet athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics.
After graduating from a secondary school he went to Novosibirsk, where he entered the Faculty of Pediatrics of the Institute of Medicine.  Markin started athletics only at age 19 in the athletics section by the institute, coached by Aleksandr Bukhasheyev.  He remained quite unknown until the Moscow Olympic Games.
On 27 April 1980, in Sochi, Markin ran a new personal best in the one lap event of 46.96 seconds. In early July Markin ran 45.34 at the Central Lenin Stadium. In the Olympic final on July 30, Markin was only fifth at the halfway mark and as the final straight opened he was still three metres behind the leader Frank Schaffer of East Germany. But with a very strong finish Markin won with a European record and world season best 44.60 (still the Russian national record over 400 m). Markin captured his second gold in the 4 × 400 m relay when, as an anchor, he outran the winner of the 400 metre hurdles, East German Volker Beck.
After a break from sports to complete his studies in medicine, Markin returned at the European Championships in 1982, where he won two bronze medals (400 m and 4 × 400 m relay). At the inaugural World Championships in Helsinki Markin, the only Soviet competing in the individual 400 metres (as the rest were concentrating on the relay), was knocked out of the final in an extremely close photo finish by eventual bronze medalist Sunder Nix of the United States. However, he finished on a high note as in the very last event of the Championships, the 4 × 400 m relay, the Soviets won an unexpected gold. West Germany already lost their winning chances on the first leg as Erwin Skamrahl (who had broken Markin's European record just three weeks earlier) gave up more than ten meters to Sergey Lovachov; the other main favorites, United States, hung with the Soviets for two and a half legs until Willie Smith tumbled and fell, leaving Markin an easy job to anchor home a USSR victory.
Markin decided to retire after hearing the Soviet decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics.

The Moncada Barracks was a military barracks in Santiago de Cuba, named after General Guillermón Moncada, a hero of the War of Independence. On July 26, 1953, the barracks was the site of an armed attack by a small group of revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro. This armed attack is widely accepted as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. The date on which the attack took place, July 26, was adopted by Castro as the name for his revolutionary movement (Movimiento 26 Julio or M 26-7) which eventually toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959.

[[Dosage Index]]
CATEGORIES: Horse racing

The Dosage Index is a mathematical figure used by breeders of Thoroughbred race horses, and sometimes by bettors handicapping horse races, to quantify a horse's ability, or inability, to negotiate the various distances at which horse races are run.  It is calculated based on an analysis of the horse's pedigree.
Interest in determining which sires of race horses transmit raw speed, and which sires transmit stamina (defined as the ability to successfully compete at longer distances) to their progeny dates back to the early 20th Century, when a French researcher, Lt. Col. J. J. Vullier, published a study on the subject (called Dosage), which was subsequently modified by an Italian breeding expert, Dr. Franco Varola, in two books he authored, entitled Typology Of The Race Horse and The Functional Development Of The Thoroughbred.
However, these observations attracted little interest from the general public until 1981, when Daily Racing Form breeding columnist Leon Rasmussen published a new version of Dosage developed by an American scientist and horse owner, Steven A. Roman, Ph.D., in his analysis of the upcoming Kentucky Derby for that year.  The new approach, which was more accessible to owners, breeders and handicappers and was supported by solid statistical data, rapidly caught on, and the term "Dosage Index" has been a fixture in the lexicon of horse racing ever since.  The details of Dosage methodology have been summarized in Dr. Roman's book entitled Dosage: Pedigree & Performance published in 2002. 
The index itself is compiled by noting the presence of certain influential sires, known as chefs-de-race (French for "chiefs of racing," or, more esoterically, "masters of the breed") in the first four generations of a horse's pedigree.  Based on what distances the progeny of the sires so designated excelled in during their racing careers (the distance preferences displayed by the sires themselves while racing being irrelevant), each chef-de-race (the list released in the early 1980s identified 120 such sires, and 85 more have been added [tpl]as of|2005|4|lc=on[/tpl]) is placed in one or two of the following categories, or "aptitudinal groups": Brilliant, Intermediate, Classic, Solid or Professional, with "Brilliant" indicating that the sire's progeny fared best at very short distances and "Professional" denoting a propensity for very long races on the part of the sire's offspring, the other three categories ranking along the same continuum in the aforementioned order.  If a chef-de-race is placed in two different aptitudinal groups, in no case can the two groups be more than two positions apart; for example, Classic-Solid or Brilliant-Classic are permissible, but Brilliant-Solid, Intermediate-Professional and Brilliant-Professional are not.
If a horse's sire is on the chef-de-race list, it counts 16 points for the group to which the sire belongs (or eight in each of two categories if the sire was placed in two groups); a grandsire counts eight points, a great-grandsire four, and a great-great-grandsire two (female progenitors do not count directly, but if any of their sires etc. are on the chef-de-race list points would accrue via such sires).
This results in a Dosage Profile consisting of five separate figures, listed in order of Brilliant-Intermediate-Classic-Solid-Professional.  Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown winner, for example, had a Dosage Profile of 20-14-7-9-0.  To arrive at the Dosage Index, the first two figures plus one-half the value of the third figure are added together, and then divided by one-half of the third figure plus the sum of the last two figures.  In this case, it would be 37.5 (20 + 14+ 3.5) divided by 12.5 (3.5 + 9 + 0), giving Secretariat a Dosage Index of exactly 3.00 (the figure almost always being expressed with two places to the right of the decimal point and rounded to the nearest .01).
A second mathematical value, called the Center of Distribution, can also be computed from the Dosage Profile.  To determine this value, the number of Brilliant points in the profile is doubled, and added to the number of Intermediate points; from this is then subtracted the number of Solid points and twice the number of Professional points.  The result is then divided by the total number of points in the entire profile, including the Classic points.  In Secretariat's case, this would work out as 54 (40 + 14) minus 9 (9 + 0) divided by 50 (20 + 14 + 7 + 9 + 0), yielding a Center of Distribution of 0.90 (the figure nearly always being rounded to the nearest 100th of a point, as with the Dosage Index).
High Dosage Index (and Center of Distribution) figures are associated with a tendency to perform best over shorter distances, while low numbers signify an inherent preference for longer races.  The median Dosage Index of contemporary North American thoroughbreds is estimated at 2.40 (the average figure being impossible to calculate because some horses have a Dosage Index of "infinity," a scenario which arises when a horse has only Brilliant and/or Intermediate chef-de-race influences in its Dosage Profile).  The average Center of Distribution for modern-day North American race horses is believed to be approximately 0.70 (both Dosage Index and Center of Distribution figures tend to be lower for European thoroughbreds because in Europe the races are longer on aggregate and European breeders thus place greater emphasis on breeding their horses for stamina rather than speed).
Retroactive research conducted at the time the term "Dosage Index" first became common knowledge revealed that no horse having a Dosage Index of higher than 4.00 had won the Kentucky Derby since at least 1929 (a year chosen because by then the number of available of chefs-de-race on which to base the figures was thought to have reached a critical mass), and that over the same period only one Belmont Stakes winner (Damascus in 1967) had such a Dosage figure.  It was also determined at that time that few horses with no chef-de-race influences in the two most stamina-laden groups, Solid and Professional, had won major races at distances of 1¼ miles or longer even if the horse had a sufficient Classic presence in its pedigree to keep the Dosage Index from being over 4.00 (when Affirmed won the Triple Crown in 1978, for instance, he became the first horse with no Solid or Professional points in his Dosage Profile to win either the Kentucky Derby or the Belmont Stakes since the 1930s).  In recent years, however, several horses with no Solid or Professional chefs-de-race in the first four generations of their pedigrees — and indeed, a few with Dosage Indexes of above 4.00 — have managed to win the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes, highlighting the issue of increasing speed and decreasing stamina in contemporary American thoroughbred pedigrees.  For example, 1999 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet had a Dosage Index of 6.02, while 2005 Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo has a Dosage Index of 4.33 and no Solid or Professional points in his Dosage Profile.  As a result of these "anomalies," the theory's usefulness has been questioned by some, at least with regard to the Kentucky Derby.  The system's defenders, however, point out that in recent times a large proportion of U.S.-bred horses with low Dosage figures have been sent to race in foreign countries where the distances of races are longer, resulting in most horses competing in the Kentucky Derby and similar American races having relatively high Dosage numbers and/or lacking Solid or Professional chef-de-race representation.  Yet the statistical foundation of Dosage remains compelling and the theory accurately differentiates Thoroughbred pedigree type for large populations of horses competitively performing over a range of distances, track surfaces and ages.

London Heliport [tpl]Airport codes||EGLW[/tpl], previously called Battersea Heliport and currently officially known as the Barclays London Heliport for sponsorship reasons, is London's only licensed heliport. The facility, which opened in 1959, is located in Battersea on the south bank of the River Thames, [tpl]Convert|3|NM|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl] southwest of Westminster Bridge and between Wandsworth Bridge and Battersea Railway Bridge.[tpl]cite web | publisher = NATS (Services) Limited | url = http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com/public/index.php%3Foption=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=173&Itemid=64.html | title = London Heliport - EGLW | accessdate = 2011-05-13[/tpl]
The heliport, once owned by Westland and then Harrods, is a very small site, making use of a jetty to provide a helipad for take-off and landing, and onshore parking for three to four aircraft, depending upon their size. The heliport provides landing, parking and refuelling services between 08:00 and 21:00 (flights are permitted between 07:00 and 23:00), albeit parking is normally restricted to smaller helicopter categories.
Flight conditions and procedures at the heliport prescribe a circuit height [tpl]Convert|1000|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl] above the Thames, in an extended figure-of-eight over the water, to seek to minimise noise pollution for residents in the area and to constrain flight operations to over the river, away from the built-up area. Ground running of rotors is restricted to a maximum of five minutes for the same reason.
In December 2003, London Heliport was acquired by Weston Homes. Landing fees effective July 2012 ranged from £280 to £1,650 depending upon the helicopter type; additional costs accrue for parking, early or late flights, and flights in evening peak times.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Since May 2011, the heliport is known as the Barclays London Heliport, after Barclays bank signed a branding deal with the owner.

[[Star (sailboat)]]

CATEGORIES: Star

The International Star (or Starboat) is a 6.9 m (22.7 ft) one-design racing keelboat for two people.
The boat must weigh at least 671 kg (1479.3 lb) with a maximum total sail area of 26.5 m[tpl]smallsup|2[/tpl] (285 ft[tpl]smallsup|2[/tpl]).  It is sloop-rigged, with a mainsail larger in proportional size than any other boat of its length.  Unlike most modern racing boats, it does not use a spinnaker when sailing downwind.  Instead, when running downwind a whisker pole is used to hold the jib out to windward for correct wind flow. Early Stars were built from wood, but modern boats are generally made of fiberglass.
The Star class pioneered an unusual circular boom vang track, which allows the vang to effectively hold the boom down even when the boom is turned far outboard on a downwind run. Another notable aspect of Star sailing is the extreme hiking position adopted by the crew and at times the helmsman, who normally use a harness to help hang low off the windward side of the boat with only their lower legs inside.
The Star was designed in 1910 by Francis Sweisguth—draftsman for William Gardner's Naval Architect office—and the first 22 were built in Port Washington, New York by Ike Smith during the winter of 1910-11.  Since that time, over 8,400 boats have been built.  The Star has been an Olympic Games class since 1932.  Although far from a modern design, the class remains popular today, with about 2,000 boats in active racing fleets in North America and Europe.
As a result of the 2011 Mid-Year Meeting in St. Petersburg, keelboats were removed from Sailing at the 2016 Summer Olympics, and therefore the Star class will not be in competition in Rio de Janeiro.http://www.sailing.org/35891.php

4X games are a genre of strategy-based video and board games in which players control an empire and "eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate". The term was first coined by Alan Emrich in his September 1993 preview of Master of Orion for Computer Gaming World. Since then, others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and design.'''
4X games are noted for their deep, complex gameplay. Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development, as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy. Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of micromanagement needed to sustain an empire scales as the empire grows. 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons, and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement with varying degrees of success.
The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X games were published in the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.

Hukvaldy ([tpl]lang-de|Hochwald[/tpl]) is a village in the Czech Republic, in the Moravian-Silesian Region. Population: 1,900. It lies 150m below the ruins of the third largest castle in the Czech Republic, Hukvaldy Castle (Hrad Hukvaldy), and is the birthplace of the composer Leoš Janáček and palaeontologist Ferdinand Stoliczka.
The castle has been rebuilt at least five times over the last 700 years, evolving from a small early gothic castle to a baroque fortress. It was first built in 1260-1270 by Mr. Frank from Příbor. He was the son of the colonizer Arnold from the Huckeswagen family.  The castle has never been conquered, probably because of the location and the massive fortress. The oldest part is an oval with many walls and a tall slim tower in the front. Above the ditch and entrance to the castle there is a dwelling building on the other side of the structure. After 1469 the castle was completely rebuilt Bishop Tas from Boskovice. In the 20th century the castle was abandoned and it fell into ruins. In 1762 there was a big fire in the castle and it was completely destroyed. Many repairs were made, but the castle is still undergoing restoration. The best preserved structure is St. Andrew´s chapel, where many concerts take place, enhanced by the excellent acoustics. Weddings also take place in the chapel. The castle is administered by Fond Janáčkovy Hukvaldy and is open from April until October. Nearby is a park where we can see mouflons, and there is also an amphitheatre.

Early in her career she saw the need to promote African dance as an art form worthy of study and performance. Primus' work was a reaction to myths of savagery and the lack of knowledge about African people. It was an effort to guide the Western world to view African dance as an important and dignified statement about another way of life. Additionally, her work provided a knowledge and meaning for dances that had been plagued by distortion of movement and excessive hip shaking of the backside.[tpl]cite book | first = Gerald E. | last = Myers| title = African American Genius in Modern Dance | publisher = American Dance Festival | location = Durham, N.C. | year = 1993 [/tpl]

[[Air mass (astronomy)]]
CATEGORIES: Astronomical imaging, Observational astronomy

In astronomy, air mass (or airmass) is the optical path length through Earth’s atmosphere for light from a celestial source. As it passes through the atmosphere, light is attenuated by scattering and absorption; the more atmosphere through which it passes, the greater the attenuation. Consequently, celestial bodies at the horizon appear less bright than when at the zenith. The attenuation, known as atmospheric extinction, is described quantitatively by the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law.
“Air mass” normally indicates relative air mass, the path length relative to that at the zenith at sea level, so by definition, the sea-level air mass at the zenith is 1. Air mass increases as the angle between the source and the zenith increases, reaching a value of approximately 38 at the horizon. Air mass can be less than one at an elevation greater than sea level; however, most closed-form expressions for air mass do not include the effects of elevation, so adjustment must usually be accomplished by other means.
In some fields, such as solar energy and photovoltaics, air mass is indicated by the acronym AM; additionally, the value of the air mass is often given by appending its value to AM, so that AM1 indicates an air mass of 1, AM2 indicates an air mass of 2, and so on. The region above Earth’s atmosphere, where there is no atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation, is considered to have
“air mass zero” (AM0).
Tables of air mass have been published by numerous authors, including Bemporad (1904), Allen (1976),[ref]
Allen’s air mass table was an abbreviated compilation of values from earlier sources, primarily
Bemporad (1904).

[[Wellington, Somerset]]
CATEGORIES: Towns in Somerset, Taunton Deane, Civil parishes in Somerset, Post towns in the TA postcode area

Wellington is a small industrial town in rural Somerset, England, situated [tpl]convert|7|mi|km[/tpl] south west of Taunton in the Taunton Deane district, near the border with Devon, which runs along the Blackdown Hills to the south of the town. The town has a population of 14,549, which includes the residents of the parish of Wellington Without, and the villages of Tone and Tonedale.
Known as Weolingtun in the Anglo-Saxon period, its name had changed to Walintone by the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. Wellington became a town under a royal charter of 1215 and during the Middle Ages it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter. Major rebuilding took place following a fire in the town in 1731, after which it became a centre for cloth-making. Wellington gave its name to the first Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, who is commemorated by the nearby Wellington Monument. The Grand Western Canal reached the town in 1835 and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1843. The town's own railway station survived until 1964. Wellington was home of Fox, Fowler and Company, which was the last commercial bank permitted to print their own sterling banknotes in England and Wales. In the 20th century closer links with Taunton meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there for work, and the M5 motorway enabled car journeys to be made more easily.
Local industries, which now include an aerosol factory and bed manufacturers, are celebrated at the Wellington Museum in Fore street. Wellington is home to the private Wellington School, and state run Court Fields Community School. It is also home to a range of cultural, sporting and religious sites including the 15th century Church of St John the Baptist.

Lee Edward Evans (born February 25, 1947 in Madera, California) is a former American athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics. He was also a Fulbright Scholar.
While running for Overfelt High School in San Jose, California, Evans was undefeated in his high school career, improving his 440-yard time from 48.2 in 1964 to 46.9 in 1965. He attended San Jose State, where he was coached by Hall of Famer Lloyd (Bud) Winter.  As a freshman, he won his first AAU championship in 440 yd (402.34 m) in 1966. He won the AAU title four years in a row (1966–1969) and again in 1972 and added the NCAA 400 m title in 1968.http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=50  His only defeat during that streak came at the hands of San Jose State teammate Tommie Smith.  The two were so competitive, Winter could not let them practice together.
Lee Evans achieved his first world record in 1966, as a member of the USA national team which broke the 4 x 400 m relay record at Los Angeles, the first team to better 3 minutes (2:59.6) for the event. The next year he broke the 4 x 220 yd (201.17 m) relay world record at Fresno in a time of 1:22.1.
In 1967, Evans won the 400 metres at the Pan American Games, in an automatic time of 44.95, which (in the era of hand times) was the first bona fide automatic time to break 45 seconds.http://run-down.com/guests/jc_sub45.php
Evans won the 1968 Olympic trials at Echo Summit, California with a world record 44.06 and demolished it in Olympic final, winning in 43.86, from which he still stands as the seventh best performer in history. Evans won a second gold as the anchorman on the 4 x 400 m relay team, setting another world record of 2:56.16. Both the times stood as a world record for almost twenty years (the relay, 24 years).  While accepting the relay Gold medal Evans, with fellow African-American medalists Larry James and Ron Freeman, received their medals wearing berets in imitation of the Black Panther Party.http://www.nndb.com/people/898/000173379/ NNDB article
After winning the AAU 400 m titles in 1969 and 1972, Evans finished only fourth in the 1972 Olympic trials, but was named a member of the 4 x 400 m relay team once more. However, the United States couldn't field a team because Vincent Matthews and Wayne Collett were suspended for a demonstration at a medal ceremony similar to the one staged by Tommie Smith and John Carlos in the previous Olympics.  Evans became a professional after the 1972 season joining the International Track Association (ITA) tour. He had some success on the ITA tour notably setting a 600 m indoors world best at the first meet in Idaho State University's Minidome .http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1087137/index.htm "It Wasn't Small Potatoes In Pocatello", Ron Reid, Sports Illustrated, March 12 1973. The ITA folded in 1976 and Evans was reinstated as an amateur in 1980 and ran a 46.5 in one of his few appearances that year, at the age of thirty-three. Evans went on to head the national athletics programs in six different African Nations before accepting a position as head cross country/track & field coach at the University of South Alabama. 
Upon fulfilling his contract, Evans plans to return to either Africa or Mexico where "you are truly free - not like this fake freedom America has everybody believing in." 
Evans' college and amateur careers as well as his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement is chronicled in Frank Murphy's The Last Protest: Lee Evans in Mexico City.
He was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1983.

[[Molera]]

CATEGORIES: Dog health

A molera is a "hole" in a Chihuahua's head; it is the same as a fontanelle in human babies. Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a "hole in the head". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together.
The simple fact that a Chihuahua has a domed head with an open molera does not predispose it to hydrocephalus as found by a study done by Greene and Braund in 1989, which concluded that "Many clinically normal toy breeds and brachycephalic (short faced) breeds also may have open fontanelles without associated hydrocephalus." Also, "There did not appear to be any relationship between the presence or size of the fontanelle and the concomitant presence of hydrocephalus." When the dog seems normal but displays enlarged ventricles of the brain (under ultrasound), its hydrocephalus is termed "occult" (having no clinical signs).

Stanisław Koniecpolski (1590 or 1594[tpl]Ref label|a|a|none[/tpl] – 11 March 1646)  is regarded as one of the most capable military commanders in the history of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was also a magnate, a royal official (starosta), a castellan, a member of the Polish nobility (szlachta), and the voivode (governor) of Sandomierz from 1625 until his death. He led many successful military campaigns against rebelling Cossacks and invading Tatars. From 1618 he held the rank of Field Crown Hetman before becoming the Grand Crown Hetman, the military commander second only to the King, in 1632.
Koniecpolski's life was one of almost constant warfare. Before he had reached the age of 20, he had fought in the Dymitriads and the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Later, in 1620, he took part in the Battle of Cecora, during which he was captured by Ottoman forces. After his release in 1623, he defeated the Ottomans' Tatar vassals several times between 1624 and 1626. With inferior numbers, during the Polish–Swedish War of 1626–29, Koniecpolski stopped the Swedish forces of Gustavus Adolphus from conquering Prussia and Pomerania before the war was concluded with the Truce of Altmark. In 1634, he defeated a major Turkish invasion at Kamieniec Podolski, in the Ukraine, while in 1644, his victory against the Tatars at the Battle of Ochmatów brought him international fame and recognition.

[[Java Architecture for XML Binding]]

CATEGORIES: Java API for XML, Java specification requests

Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) allows Java developers to map Java classes to XML representations. JAXB provides two main features: the ability to marshal Java objects into XML and the inverse, i.e. to unmarshal XML back into Java objects. In other words, JAXB allows storing and retrieving data in memory in any XML format, without the need to implement a specific set of XML loading and saving routines for the program's class structure. It is similar to xsd.exe and XmlSerializer in the .NET Framework.
JAXB is particularly useful when the specification is complex and changing. In such a case, regularly changing the XML Schema definitions to keep them synchronised with the Java definitions can be time consuming and error-prone.
JAXB is a part of the Java SE platform and one of the APIs in the Java EE platform, and is part of the Java Web Services Development Pack (JWSDP). It is also one of the foundations for WSIT. JAXB is part of SE version 1.6.
JAXB 1.0 was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 31.[tpl]cite web |url=http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=031 |title=JSRs: Java Specification Requests.

The Jumo 222 was a high-power multiple bank in-line piston aircraft engine design from Junkers, designed under the management of Ferdinand Brandner of the Junkers Motorenwerke. Such was the performance of the engine compared to contemporary designs that many developments of wartime Luftwaffe piston-engined aircraft designs were based around it, at least as an option. The design failed to mature even after years of intensive development, dooming the entire Bomber B program along with it. Only a small number were built, never leaving the prototype phase, but the design nevertheless continued appearing, endlessly, on proposals for new Luftwaffe multi-engined designs long after most had given up hope it would ever work.

[[HP Color recovery]]

CATEGORIES: Hewlett-Packard products

For color recovery of archived television broadcasts, see Colour recovery.
Color recovery is a technique used in Hewlett-Packard's older workstation graphics devices to produce a 'near 24-bit' color look from an 8-bit framebuffer.  Color recovery does rely on software support which is provided by libraries such as PHIGS, PEXLib, Starbase and even Xlib although Xlib does not enable it by default.
When using Color Recovery the data is sent to the driver as an 24-bit image.  The driver will then dither the data (in most cases this can be done by the graphics hardware for maximum performance) which is stored in the framebuffer as an 8-bit image. On displaying that 8-bit image data, HP's color recovery technology produces in real time an approximation of the original 24-bit image based on the hints provided by the dithered data.  The result is significantly better looking than dithering alone.  According to the article in HP's journal, the color recovery could achieve up to 23-bits of color accuracy.
Color Recovery was supported on framebuffers such as:

A series of injuries hampered his running career, causing him to miss out on the 1956 and 1960 Olympics, but he had his best season in 1964. 
At first he won his only AAU title in 400 m, then he won the 400 m (tying the world record of 44.9) at the 1964 Olympic Trials in Los Angeles. In the Tokyo Olympics final, Larrabee was in fifth place going into the final turn, when he passed everyone in front of him with a burst of speed to win the gold medal in 45.1. Larrabee also ran the second leg on United States gold medal winning 4x400 m relay team that won in the world record time of 3:00.7.
After the Tokyo Olympics Larrabee worked as a mathematics teacher, ran a beverage distributing company with his brother and worked part-time as Adidas’ U.S. shoe representative to track and field, a position that allowed him to travel and keep connected to the sport.
Larrabee remained physically active well after his running career had wound down, taking up tennis, scuba diving, skiing, hiking (for which he raised llamas as pack animals) and mountain climbing. 
Although he was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer in 2001 and was only expected to live a few weeks, he continued to live life to the fullest for two more years, thanks to chemotherapy treatments.  Mike Larrabee died in his home at Santa Maria, California, aged 69.  He was posthumously added to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in December 2003.http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/ USATF National Hall of Fame
The stadium at Ventura High School, which he attended, is named for him.

[[WS-ReliableMessaging]]

CATEGORIES: Web service specifications

WS-ReliableMessaging describes a protocol that allows SOAP messages to be reliably delivered between distributed applications in the presence of software component, system, or network failures.
The original specification was written by BEA Systems, Microsoft, IBM, and Tibco and in March, 2003 and subsequently refined over the next two years. The February, 2005 version was submitted to the OASIS Web Services Reliable Exchange (WS-RX) Technical Committee in June of that year. The resulting WS-ReliableMessaging 1.1  was approved as an OASIS Standard on June 14th, 2007, and v1.2 was approved on February 2, 2009.
Prior to WS-ReliableMessaging, OASIS produced a competing standard (WS-Reliability) that was supported by a coalition of vendors; namely Fujitsu, Hitachi,   NEC, Oracle Corporation, Progress Software, and Sun Microsystems. Most of these vendors now also support the WS-ReliableMessaging specification.

[[Intersection homology]]

CATEGORIES: Intersection theory, Algebraic topology, Generalized manifolds, Duality theories, Cohomology theories

In topology, a branch of mathematics, intersection homology is an analogue of singular homology especially well-suited for the study of singular spaces, discovered by Mark Goresky and Robert MacPherson in the fall of 1974 and developed by them over the next few years. 
Intersection cohomology was used to prove the Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures and the Riemann–Hilbert correspondence. It is closely related to L2 cohomology.

The Mask of Zorro is a 1998 American swashbuckler film based on the Zorro character created by Johnston McCulley. It was directed by Martin Campbell and stars Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Stuart Wilson. In the story, the original Zorro (Hopkins) escapes from prison to find his long-lost daughter (Zeta-Jones) and avenge the death of his wife against the corrupt governor (Wilson). He is aided by his successor (Banderas), who also pursues his own vendetta.
Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment had developed the film for TriStar Pictures with directors Mikael Salomon and Robert Rodriguez before Campbell signed on in 1996. Salomon cast Sean Connery as Don Diego de la Vega, while Rodriguez brought Banderas in the lead role. Connery dropped out and was replaced with Hopkins, and The Mask of Zorro began filming in January 1997 at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, Mexico. The film was released in the United States on July 17, 1998 with both financial and critical success. The Legend of Zorro, a sequel also starring Banderas and Zeta-Jones, and directed by Campbell, was released in 2005, but failed to receive the overall positive reception of its predecessor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051027/REVIEWS/510270309/1023|title=The Legend of Zorro|author=Roger Ebert|date=October 28, 2005|work=rogerebert.com[/tpl]

No Mercy was held every year in October and from 2003 to 2006 the event was exclusive to the SmackDown! brand. Although WWE is known to pick mainstream music for their PPV theme songs, No Mercy sometimes features its own WWE-produced theme song, also named "No Mercy". This song was composed by WWE's music producer, Jim Johnston. The song debuted at No Mercy 2002 and was featured in full on that event's DVD. The song was later remixed and used again for No Mercy 2004 and again in 2006, also being featured on the event's DVD. The lyrics vary slightly between the two versions. In 2007 the song was remade with different sounding instruments and a different vocalist.

[[Classical cipher]]

CATEGORIES: Classical ciphers

A cipher is a means of concealing a message, where letters of the message are substituted or transposed for other letters, letter pairs, and sometimes for many letters. In cryptography, a classical cipher is a type of cipher that was used historically but now has fallen, for the most part, into disuse. In general, classical ciphers operate on an alphabet of letters (such as "A-Z"), and are implemented by hand or with simple mechanical devices. They are probably the most basic types of ciphers, which made them not very reliable, especially after new technology was developed.  Modern schemes use computers or other digital technology, and operate on bits and bytes. Many classical ciphers were used by well-respected people, such as Julius Caesar and Napoleon, who created their own ciphers which were then popularly used.  Many ciphers had their origins in the military and were used for transporting secret messages among people on the same side. Classical schemes are often susceptible to ciphertext-only attacks, sometimes even without knowledge of the system itself, using tools such as frequency analysis. Sometimes grouped with classical ciphers are more advanced mechanical or electro-mechanical cipher machines, such as the Enigma machine.

[[Attainder]]

CATEGORIES: Public law, Legal history of England, English legal terms

In English criminal law, attainder or attinctura was the metaphorical "stain" or "corruption of blood" which arose from being condemned for a serious capital crime (felony or treason). It entailed losing not only one's property and hereditary titles, but typically also the right to pass them on to one's heirs. Both men and women condemned of capital crimes could be attainted.
Attainder by confession resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges or before the coroner in sanctuary. Attainder by verdict resulted from conviction by a jury. Attainder by process resulted from a legislative act outlawing a fugitive. The latter form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in the United States), and the other forms have been abolished.

[[Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes]]

CATEGORIES: 1868 births, 1947 deaths, English novelists

Marie Adelaide Elizabeth Rayner Lowndes, née Belloc (5 August 1868 – 14 November 1947), was a prolific English novelist.
Active from 1898 until her death, she had a literary reputation for combining exciting incident with psychological interest. Her most famous novel, The Lodger (1913), based on the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888, has been adapted for the screen five different times; the first movie version was Alfred Hitchcock's silent film The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), followed by Maurice Elvey's in 1932, John Brahm's in 1944, Man in the Attic in 1953, and David Ondaatje's in 2009. Another novel of hers, Letty Lynton (1931), was the basis for the 1932 motion picture of the same name starring Joan Crawford.
Born in Marylebone, London and raised in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, France, Mrs Belloc Lowndes was the only daughter of French barrister Louis Belloc and English feminist Bessie Parkes. Her brother was Hilaire Belloc, whom she wrote of in her last work The Young Hilaire Belloc (published posthumously in 1956). Her paternal grandfather was the French painter Jean-Hilaire Belloc and her maternal great-great-grandfather was Joseph Priestley. In 1896 she married Frederick Sawrey A. Lowndes (1868-1940).
She published a biography, H.R.H. The Prince of Wales: An Account of His Career, in 1898. From then on novels, reminiscences and plays came from her quill at the rate of one per year until 1946. Her mother died in 1925, fifteen years before her father. In the memoir, I, too, Have Lived in Arcadia, published in 1942,she told the story of her mother's life, compiled largely from old family letters and her own memories of her early life in France.
A second autobiography Where love and friendship dwelt appeared posthumously in 1948.
She died 14 November 1947 at the home of her elder daughter, Countess Iddesleigh (wife of the third EarlThePeerage.com, person page 7575) in Eversley Cross, Hampshire. She was interred in France, in La Celle-Saint-Cloud near Versailles, where she spent her youth.

[[Fallacy of distribution]]
CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies

A fallacy of distribution is an informal fallacy occurring when an argument assumes there is no difference between a term in the distributive (referring to every member of a class) and collective (referring to the class itself as a whole) sense.
There are two variations of this fallacy:
While fallacious, arguments that make these assumptions may be persuasive because of the representativeness heuristic.

[[Existential fallacy]]

CATEGORIES: Syllogistic fallacies, Quantificational fallacies

The existential fallacy, or existential instantiation, is a formal fallacy.  In the existential fallacy, we presuppose that a class has members when we are not supposed to do so; that is, when we should not assume existential import.
One example would be: "Everyone in the room is pretty and smart". It does not imply that there is a pretty, smart person in the room, because it does not state that there is a person in the room.
An existential fallacy is committed in a medieval categorical syllogism because it has two universal premises and a particular conclusion with no assumption that at least one member of the class exists, which is not established by the premises.
In modern logic, the presupposition that a class has members is seen as unacceptable. In 1905, Bertrand Russell wrote an essay entitled "The Existential Import of Proposition", in which he called this Boolean approach "Peano's interpretation".
The fallacy does not occur in enthymemes, where hidden premises required to make the syllogism valid assume the existence of at least one member of the class [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl].
This is invalid if the A form lacks existential import, and valid if it has existential import. It is held to be valid, and so we know how the A form is to be interpreted. One then naturally asks about the O form; what do the syllogisms tell us about it? The answer is that they tell us nothing. This is because Aristotle did not discuss weakened forms of syllogisms, in which one concludes a particular proposition when one could already conclude the corresponding universal. For example, he does not mention the form:
If people had thoughtfully taken sides for or against the validity of this form, that would clearly be relevant to the understanding of the O form. But the weakened forms were typically ignored.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |first=Terence |last=Parsons |editor=Edward N.

[[Mount Cromwell]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Alberta, Winston Churchill Range

Mount Cromwell is a mountain located in the Sunwapta River Valley of Jasper National Park, in Alberta, Canada. Cromwell lines two km north of the east summit of Stutfield Peak. The mountain was named in 1972 by J. Monroe Thorington after Oliver Eaton Cromwell, an American climber who made many first ascents in the Canadian Rockies.
The first ascent was made in 1938 by E. Cromwell, E. Cromwell jr., F.S. North, J. Monroe Thorington, guided by Edward Feuz jr.
In 2005, Bill Corbett, author of "The 11,000ers of the Canadian Rockies," climbed to the top of Mount Cromwell.  At the summit, his GPS registered 11,006 feet.  So perhaps Mount Cromwell should be included in the list of the Canadian Rocky Mountains that are over 11,000 feet in elevation.

The Rocky Mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus) is an extinct locust species that ranged through the western half of the United States and some western portions of Canada until the end of the 19th century. Sightings often placed their swarms in numbers far larger than any other species of locust, with one famed sighting estimated at [tpl]convert|198000|sqmi|km2[/tpl] in size (greater than the area of California), weighing 27.5 million tons, and consisting of some 12.5 trillion insects – the greatest concentration of animals ever speculatively guessed, according to Guinness World Records.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Melanoplus_spretus.html|title=Melanoplus spretus, Rocky Mountain grasshopper|work=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate= 2009-04-16[/tpl]
Less than 30 years later, the species was apparently extinct. The last recorded sighting of a live specimen was in 1902 in southern Canada. Because a creature so ubiquitous was not expected to become extinct, very few samples were ever collected (though a few preserved remains have been found in Grasshopper Glacier, Montana). Though grasshoppers still cause significant crop damage, their populations do not approach the densities of true locusts.[tpl]fact|reason=locust article states no biological distinction.

Robert Rossen (March 16, 1908 – February 18, 1966) was an American screenwriter, film director, and producer whose film career spanned almost three decades.
His 1949 film All the King's Men won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, while Rossen was nominated for an Oscar as Best Director. He won the Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture. In 1961 he directed The Hustler, which was nominated for nine Oscars and won two. Rossen was nominated as Best Director and with Sidney Carroll for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win either award.
After directing and writing for the stage in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937. There he worked as a screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Against the War, a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II. In 1945 he joined a picket line against Warner Bros., making an enemy of Jack Warner. After making one film for Hal Wallis's newly formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.
Rossen was a member of the American Communist Party from 1937 to about 1947, and believed the Party was "dedicated to social causes of the sort that we as poor Jews from New York were interested in."[tpl]sfn|LoBianco – TCM||[/tpl] However, he finally ended all relations with the Party in 1949. Rossen was twice called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), in 1951 and in 1953. He exercised his Fifth Amendment rights at his first appearance, refusing to state whether he had ever been a Communist. As a result he found himself blacklisted by Hollywood studios as well as unable to renew his passport. At his second appearance he named 57 people as current or former Communists and his blacklisting ended. In order to repair finances he produced his next film, Mambo, in Italy in 1954. While The Hustler in 1961 was a great success, conflict with the star of Lilith so disillusioned Rossen that he made no more films during the last three years of his life.
Rossen's films for Warner generally described the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. He wrote that ambition and the desire for success were common themes in his work. His films often featured strong female characters. All Rossen's playscripts were adaptions except three he based on real events. While head of production at Warner, Wallis considered that some of his best films were written by Rossen.

Illicit major is a formal fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is undistributed in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion.
This fallacy has the following argument form:
Example:
In this argument, the major term is "mammals". This is distributed in the conclusion (the last statement) because we are making a claim about a property of all mammals: that they are not cats. However, it is not distributed in the major premise (the first statement) where we are only talking about a property of some mammals: Only some mammals are dogs.
The error is in assuming that the converse of the first statement (that all mammals are dogs) is also true.

[[Holden Torana]]
CATEGORIES: Vehicles introduced in 1967, Cars of Australia, Holden vehicles, Sedans, Hatchbacks

The Holden Torana is a car that was manufactured by General Motors–Holden's (GM-H), the Australian subsidiary of General Motors (GM) from 1967 to 1980. The name comes from an Aboriginal word meaning "to fly". The first Torana (HB series) appeared in 1967 and was a four-cylinder compact vehicle with origins in the British Vauxhall Vivas of the mid-1960s.
Whilst the 1969-73 (LC and LJ series) cars included more popular, longer-wheelbase six-cylinder versions, and with the 1974-77 (LH and LX series) cars adding eight-cylinder versions to the mix, a range of four-cylinder versions continued for the entire production life of the Torana (with later versions being marketed as the Holden Sunbird from November 1976).
Changing tack in Australian motor sport, Holden released the LC Torana GTR XU-1 in 1970, with performance enhanced drivetrain and handling. From this time through to the release of the Holden Commodore, the Torana remained Holden's most successful sports/performance vehicle, with many victories garnered in rallying and circuit racing.
The introduction of the VB Commodore in 1978 was preceded by the arrival of the updated UC Torana/Sunbird twins but with no sports versions or V8 engine options. The Torana was subsequently discontinued in 1979, followed by the four-cylinder Sunbird in 1980.
In South Korea the LJ Torana was produced locally as the Chevrolet 1700 (시보레 1700, 1972–1978) and Saehan Camina (새한 카미나, 1976–1978).

[[Illicit minor]]

CATEGORIES: Syllogistic fallacies

Illicit minor is a formal fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is undistributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion. 
This fallacy has the following argument form:
Example: 
The minor term here is mammal, which is not distributed in the minor premise "All cats are mammals," because this premise is only defining a property of possibly some mammals (i.e., that they're cats.) However, in the conclusion "All mammals are felines," mammal is distributed (it is talking about all mammals being felines).  It is shown to be false by any mammal that is not a feline; for example, a dog.

[[Öre]]

Öre ([tpl]IPA-sv|øːrɛ|pronounced[/tpl]) is the discontinued centesimal subdivision of the Swedish krona. The plural and singular are the same in the indefinite forms, whereas the singular definite form is öret and the plural definite is örena. The name derives from the Latin aureus (gold), the name of a coin worth 25 denarii.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] The corresponding subdivisions of the Norwegian and Danish krones are called øre.
After 1991, the only coin in use with a value below 1 kr was the 50 öre coin. On 18 December 2008, the Swedish Riksbank announced a recommendation to the Swedish government to phase out the final öre coin by 2010.The Local.

Öre is still legal tender on cards, however.
During the Middle Ages, the öre was a unit of Swedish currency equal to 1/8 of a mark, 3 örtugar or either 24, 36 or 48 penningar (depending on the geographical area in which it was used). It was used as a counting unit for currency already in the 11th century, but was not minted until 1522. This öre was withdrawn in 1776, but returned in 1855 as 1/100 of the riksdaler. The riksdaler was replaced by the krona in 1873 (one riksdaler equalling one krona in the exchange), but öre remained the name of the subdivision of the currency.

[[Brother Records]]

right|Brother Records logoBrother Records, Inc. (BRI) is a record label and holding company formed in October 1966 that holds the intellectual property rights of the Beach Boys, including the "The Beach Boys" trademark.
In mid-1966, Beach Boys business manager Nick Grillo formed the Brother Records corporation, bringing in Van Dyke Parks's manager and Brian Wilson's friend David Anderle to run the organization from  an office on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.  Motivated in no small part by the negative reaction of Capitol Records to some of Brian's ideas for Smile, the new company gave the band more control over their products.
The shareholders were the 1966 members of the Beach Boys: Wilson brothers Brian, Carl, and Dennis, along with their first cousin Mike Love, their friend Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston, who traded his share in 1971.  In 1983, shortly after the death of Dennis Wilson, his estate sold his share back to the corporation to repay loans. In 1998, following Carl Wilson's death, his share of the corporation passed to and is still controlled by his estate.
The label's first releases were the Beach Boys' "Heroes and Villains" single and Smiley Smile album in 1967, distributed by Capitol Records. Numerous other Beach Boys albums were first released on the joint Brother/Reprise Records label during the 1970s, including Sunflower, Holland, and 15 Big Ones. An album by The Flame, produced by Carl Wilson, was released in 1970 on the Brother label, distributed by Star-day King Records. By the late 1970s, Beach Boys records were issued on Brother and distributed by Caribou Records through CBS. As of 2007, the most recent CD re-release series of the Beach Boys' 1970s albums is on the joint Brother/Capitol Records label.
Since the 1980s, Brother Records' business manager is Elliott Lott, a former chauffeur for The Beach Boys

Zyklon was a Norwegian blackened death metal band formed in 1998 by Samoth and Trym of Emperor, along with members of Myrkskog. Their style has been described as modern death metal with black and industrial undertones. After more than a 2 year hiatus, the band officially split up in January 2010.BLABBERMOUTH.NET - ZYKLON Calls It Quits
All the band's lyrics were written by former Emperor drummer Faust, then member of Casey Chaos' side project SCUM and Italian industrial black metal band Aborym.
Despite Samoth having been in a previous Emperor side project called Zyklon-B, the two are not related; Zyklon B is the name of a lethal gas used by German Nazis; "Zyklon" is, according to Samoth, a play on the word "cyclone", since the word is spelled syklon in Norwegian.

The majority of these places and things are named after Chiang Chung-cheng, the preferred given name of Chiang Kai-shek. As a result, when translating into English or other non-Chinese languages, it sometimes would be replaced by "Chiang Kai-shek" instead of simply by transliteration.
The usual official romanization of this name is either "Zhongzheng" (using the hanyu pinyin system), or "Chungzheng" (using the older Wade-Giles system). The former spelling has been standard in Taiwan since 2009 and in mainland China since 1958. Between about 2002 and 2009 in Taiwan, the variant "Jhongjheng" (using the tongyong pinyin system) was also seen. Other variations, using informal transcriptions, sometimes omit either instance of the letter "g", or use "u" and "o" interchangeably. The two syllables ("Zhong" and "zheng") may be separated  by a hyphen or space.

[[Electrostatic induction]]

CATEGORIES: Electrostatics, Electricity

Electrostatic induction is a redistribution of electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges.[ref]
</ref>  Induction was discovered by British scientist [[John Canton]] in 1753 and Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] in 1762.<ref>
</ref>  [[Electrostatic generator]]s, such as the [[Wimshurst machine]], the [[Van de Graaff generator]] and the [[electrophorus]], use this principle.  Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light nonconductive objects, such as balloons, paper or styrofoam scraps, to static electric charges.   Electrostatic induction should not be confused with [[electromagnetic induction]].

The newspaper was the inspiration of Barney Kilgore, then the president of Dow Jones. (Kilgore is credited as the "genius" who transformed the Wall Street Journal from a provincial financial daily with a circulation of 32,000, mostly on Wall Street, into the national giant it became.)
It was Kilgore's idea that the nation needed a weekly national newspaper that would synthesize all the week's events and current trends into an attractive, convenient package. In effect, the National Observer would offer the kind of quality non-financial journalism that the Wall Street Journal once featured in its front-page "leaders" (the articles that occupy the left- and right-hand columns).[tpl]cite news|last=Morton|first=John|title=Great While It Lasted |url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=2721|newspaper=American Journalism Review|date=December 2002[/tpl]

[[Electroscope]]

CATEGORIES: Electrostatics, Measuring instruments, Historical scientific instruments

An electroscope is an early scientific instrument that is used to detect the presence and magnitude of electric charge on a body.  It was the first electrical measuring instrument.   The first electroscope, a pivoted needle called the versorium, was invented by British physician William Gilbert around 1600.[ref]
 a translation by  P. Fleury Mottelay of William Gilbert (1600) ''Die Magnete'', London</ref>   The '''pith-ball electroscope''' and the '''gold-leaf electroscope''' are two classical types of electroscope that are still used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of [[electrostatics]].  A type of electroscope is also used in the [[quartz fiber radiation dosimeter]]. Electroscopes were used by the Austrian scientist [[Victor Hess]] in the discovery of [[cosmic rays]].
Electroscopes detect electric charge by the motion of a test object due to the Coulomb electrostatic force.  The electric potential or voltage of an object equals its charge divided by its capacitance, so electroscopes can be regarded as crude voltmeters.  The accumulation of enough charge to detect with an electroscope requires hundreds or thousands of volts, so electroscopes are only used with high voltage sources such as static electricity and electrostatic machines.  Electroscopes generally give only a rough, qualitative indication of the magnitude of the charge; an instrument that measures charge quantitatively is called an electrometer.

[[Field lacrosse]]

CATEGORIES: Variations of lacrosse, Team sports

Field Lacrosse, sometimes referred to as the "fastest sport on two feet," is a full contact outdoor men's sport played with ten players on each team. The sport originated among Native Americans, and the modern rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867. Field lacrosse is one of three major versions of lacrosse played internationally. The other versions, women's lacrosse (established in the 1890s) and box lacrosse (which originated in the 1930s), are played under significantly different rules.
The object of the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a lacrosse stick or crosse, to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball. In addition to the lacrosse stick, players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact.  The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field and require the ball to be moved continuously towards the opposing goal.
Lacrosse is governed internationally by the 31-member Federation of International Lacrosse, which sponsors the World Lacrosse Championships once every four years. A former Olympic sport, attempts by the international governing body to reinstate it to the Games has been hampered by insufficient international participation and by the existence of separate governing bodies for the men's and women's versions of the sport until 2008. Field lacrosse is played professionally in North America by the Major League Lacrosse. It is also played on a high amateur level by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States, the Australian Senior Lacrosse Championship series, and the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association.

[[Ricardo Zamora Trophy]]

CATEGORIES: La Liga, Spanish football trophies and awards

The Ricardo Zamora Trophy ([tpl]lang-es|Trofeo Ricardo Zamora[/tpl]) is a football award, established by Spanish newspaper MARCA in 1958. The award goes to the goalkeeper who has the lowest "goals-to-games" ratio.Similar to goals against average in ice hockey or earned run average in baseball. It is named after legendary Spanish goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora.
In the inaugural year of the award, the winning goalkeeper had to play at least 15 league matches in the current season. In 1964, the limit for matches a goalkeeper had to play was raised to 22. In 1983, it was raised to 28 matches, including the rule that the goalkeeper had to play at least 60 minutes in match for it to count. 
In the last couple of years the list of goalkeepers who would have won the trophy prior to 1958 has been published. For these seasons, a limit of matches that the goalkeeper had to play has been applied. For the leagues with only 10 teams the limit of matches was 14, for those of 12 teams it was 17 and for those of 14 the limit was 20 matches. For those leagues of 16 teams it is 22 - as originally established for the trophy from 1964 to 1983.

 Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.Gender and reproductive rights home page

Reproductive rights may include some or all of the following: the right to legal or safe abortion; the right to birth control; freedom from coerced sterilization, abortion, and contraception; the right to access good-quality reproductive healthcare; and the right to education and access in order to make free and informed reproductive choices. Reproductive rights may also include the right to receive education about sexually transmitted infections and other aspects of sexuality, and protection from gender-based practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM).Template
Reproductive rights began to develop as a subset of human rights at the United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights. The resulting non binding Proclamation of Teheran was the first international document to recognize one of these rights when it stated that: "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children."[tpl]cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Lynn P. |coauthors=Stephen L.

Thus, while some of these rights have already been recognized in hard law, that is, in legally binding international human rights instruments, others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and, therefore, have at best the status of soft law in international law, while a further group is yet to be accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of advocacy.[ref]Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change, US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003): 
 We have been leaders in bringing arguments for a woman's right to choose abortion within the rubric of international human rights. However, there is no binding hard norm that recognizes women's right to terminate a pregnancy. (...) While there are hard norms prohibiting sex discrimination that apply to girl adolescents, these are problematic since they must be applied to a substantive right (i.e., the right to health) and the substantive reproductive rights of adolescents are not `hard' (yet!). There are no hard norms on age discrimination that would protect adolescents' ability to exercise their rights to reproductive health, sexual education, or reproductive decisionmaking. In addition, there are no hard norms prohibiting discrimination based on marital status, which is often an issue with respect to unmarried adolescents' access to reproductive health services and information. The soft norms support the idea that the hard norms apply to adolescents under 18. They also fill in the substantive gaps in the hard norms with respect to reproductive health services and information as well as adolescents' reproductive autonomy. (...) There are no hard norms in international human rights law that directly address HIV/AIDS directly. At the same time, a number of human rights bodies have developed soft norms to secure rights that are rendered vulnerable by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (...) Practices with implications for women's reproductive rights in relation to HIV/AIDS are still not fully covered under existing international law, although soft norms have addressed them to some extent. (...) There is a lack of explicit prohibition of mandatory testing of HIV-positive pregnant women under international law. (...) None of the global human rights treaties explicitly prohibit child marriage and no treaty prescribes an appropriate minimum age for marriage. The onus of specifying a minimum age at marriage rests with the states' parties to these treaties. (...) We have to rely extensively on soft norms that have evolved from the TMBs and that are contained in conference documents to assert that child marriage is a violation of fundamental human rights.[/ref]

The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is the most senior advisor on health matters in a government. There are four CMOs in the United Kingdom who are appointed to advise their respective governments: Her Majesty's Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government"The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is the Scottish Government's principal medical adviser", The Scottish Government, Health & Community Care, retrieved 24 November 2008 and the Welsh Assembly Government. Each CMO is assisted by one or more Deputy Chief Medical Officers.
In England, the CMO is a member of the board of the National Health Service (NHS), a civil servant in the Department of Health, and head of the medical civil service. The Republic of Ireland has a similar officer.
The Chief Medical Officer is a qualified medical doctor whose speciality is usually in public health, and whose work focuses on the health of communities rather than health of individuals.  In the UK, the CMO is one of six chief professional officers who advise the government in their respective health and social care disciplines.
The equivalent US term is Surgeon General. The term Surgeon General is also a used in the British Armed Forces for the head of medical services.  In non-government organisations, such as policing, chief medical officer may refer to a senior medical post in the organisation. When appointed outside government the chief medical officer will often decide on physical and mental fitness to serve issues, and the role may not be in public health.

[[Robert Montgomery (poet)]]

CATEGORIES: 1807 births, 1855 deaths, Alumni of Lincoln College, Oxford, English poets

Robert Montgomery (1807–1855) was an English poet, the son of Robert Gomery. He was educated at a private school in Bath, Somerset, and founded an unsuccessful weekly paper in that city. In 1828 he published The Omni-presence of the Deity, which hit popular religious sentiment so exactly that it ran through eight editions in as many months. In 1830 he followed it with The Puffiad (a satire), and Satan, or Intellect without God. An exhaustive review in Blackwood's by John Wilson, followed in the thirty-first number by a burlesque of Satan, and two articles in the first volume of Fraser, ridiculed Montgomery's pretensions and the excesses of his admirers. But his name was immortalized by Macaulay's famous onslaught in the Edinburgh Review for April 1830, "an annihilating so Jove-like that the victim automatically commands the spectator's rueful sympathy."D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Charles Lee, The Stuffed Owl, p. 173. This review did not, however, diminish the sale of his poems; The Omnipresence of the Deity reached its 28th edition in 1858. In 1830 Montgomery entered Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1833 and M.A. in 1838. Taking holy orders in 1835 he obtained a curacy at Whittington, Shropshire, which he exchanged in 1836 for the charge of the church of St. Jude, Glasgow.

[[Hawaiian architecture]]
CATEGORIES: Hawaiian architecture, Hawaii culture, Architecture in Hawaii

Hawaiian architecture is a distinctive style of architectural arts developed and employed primarily in the Hawaiian Islands of the present-day United States — buildings and various other structures indicative of the people of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and the environment and culture in which they live.  Though based on imported Western styles, unique Hawaiian traits make Hawaiian architectural styles stand alone against other styles.  Hawaiian architecture reflects the history of the islands from antiquity through the kingdom era, from its territorial years to statehood and beyond.
The various styles through the history of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i are telling of the attitudes and the spirit of its people.  Hawaiian architecture is said to tell the story of how indigenous native Hawaiians and their complex society in ancient times slowly evolved with the infusion of new styles from beyond its borders, from the early European traders, the visiting whalers and fur trappers from the Canadian wilderness, the missions of the New Englanders and French Catholics, the communes of the Latter-day Saints from Utah, the plantation laborer cultures from the Orient to the modern American metropolis that Honolulu is today.Starwood Sheraton Moana Surfrider Hotel|thumb|right|280px|Opened in 1901, the Moana Hotel is a model for contemporary Hawaiian architectural design

[[Richard Turner (iron-founder)]]

CATEGORIES: 1798 births, 1881 deaths, Foundrymen, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew

Richard Turner (1798-1881) was an Irish iron-founder and manufacturer of glasshouses, born in Dublin. 
His works included the Palm House at Kew Gardens (with Decimus Burton), the glasshouse in the Winter Gardens at Regent's Park in London, the Palm House at Belfast Botanic Gardens and the Curvilinear Range at the Irish National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Ireland. He was a pioneer in the structural use of wrought iron.  The glasshouses which he designed were sophisticated and innovative, as the use of wrought and cast iron was at the leading edge of building technology at the time.  He used standardised components and prefabricated elements manufactured off-site for later assembly, together with curved glass in long lengths.
Turner designed and constructed the railway sheds at Westland Row and at the Broadstone in Dublin, and Lime Street in Liverpool, but also turned his hand to the design and manufacture of railings, boilers, cisterns and bedsteads.  His entry in Thom’s directory for 1849 describes him as ‘manufacturer of wrought-iron gates, railway conservatories, hothouses etc., and hot water engineer’, indicating the broad range of activities which the firm undertook.
Turner entered the initial competition for designs for the London International Exhibition of 1851 and out of 233 entries was jointly awarded the second prize along with an entry by Hector Horeau. The final built design was "The Crystal Palace" by Joseph Paxton.[/ref]

The Royal Saxon tomb in Prittlewell is a high-status Anglo-Saxon tomb excavated at Prittlewell, north of Southend-on-Sea, in the English county of Essex.
In the autumn of 2003, in preparation for a road-widening scheme, an archaeological survey was carried out on a plot of land to the north-east of Priory Park in Prittlewell. The archaeologists were lucky in the placement of their trench and uncovered a set of Saxon remains.
Archaeologists from the Museum of London Archaeology Service, under the supervision of Atkins Ltd, excavated the site and discovered an undisturbed 7th century chamber grave beneath a mound. They described it as "the most spectacular discovery of its kind made during the past 60 years".  Earlier excavations had indicated Saxon burials in the area however it was not expected that such a significant find could be made.
The quality and preservation of the Prittlewell Chamber Tomb has led to inevitable comparisons with the Sutton Hoo Ship Burial and associated graves. The artefacts found were of a quality that it is likely that Prittlewell was a tomb of one of the Kings of Essex and the discovery of golden foil crosses indicates that the inhabitant was an early Christian.

It originally referred to the well-known subglacial outburst floods from Vatnajökull, Iceland, which are triggered by geothermal heating and occasionally by a volcanic subglacial eruption, but it is now used to describe any large and abrupt release of water from a subglacial or proglacial lake/reservoir. 
Since jökulhlaups emerge from hydrostatically-sealed lakes with floating levels far above the threshold, their peak discharge can be much larger than that of a marginal or extra-marginal lake burst. The hydrograph of a jökulhlaup from Vatnajökull typically either climbs over a period of weeks with the largest flow near the end, or it climbs much faster during the course of some hours. These patterns are suggested to reflect channel melting, and sheet flow under the front, respectively.[tpl]cite journal|last=Björnsson|first=Helgi|title=Subglacial Lakes and Jökulhlaups in Iceland|journal=Global and Planetary Change|year=2002|volume=35|pages=255–271|url=http://www.norvol.hi.is/pdf/HB2003GlobPlanCh.pdf[/tpl] Similar processes on a very large scale occurred during the deglaciation of North America and Europe after the last ice age (e.g., Lake Agassiz and the English Channel), and presumably at earlier times, although the geological record is not well preserved.

[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]
CATEGORIES: Poetry by William Shakespeare, 1599 works, Shakespeare Apocrypha

The Passionate Pilgrim (1599) is an anthology of 20 poems collected and published by William Jaggard that were attributed to "W. Shakespeare" on the title page, only five of which are considered authentically Shakespearean. These are two sonnets, later to be published in the 1609 collection of Shakespeare's sonnets, and three poems extracted from the play Love's Labour's Lost. Internal and external evidence contradicts the title-page attribution to Shakespeare. Five were attributed to other poets during his lifetime, two were published in other collections anonymously, and critics agree that the remaining eight cannot be attributed to Shakespeare on stylistic grounds. Jaggard later published an augmented edition with poems he knew to be by Thomas Heywood.

[[Duchenne de Boulogne]]

Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne (de Boulogne) (September 17, 1806, in Boulogne-sur-Mer – September 15, 1875, in Paris) was a French neurologist who revived Galvani's research and greatly advanced the science of electrophysiology. The era of modern neurology developed from Duchenne's understanding of the conductivity of neural pathways, his revelations of the effect of lesions on these structures and his diagnostic innovations including deep tissue biopsy, nerve conduction tests (NCS), and clinical photography.
Neurology did not exist in France before Duchenne and although many medical historians regard Jean-Martin Charcot as the father of the discipline, Charcot owed much to Duchennne, often acknowledging him as, "mon maitre en neurologie" (my master in neurology).McHenry, p. 282: "His interest in neurology, which was slow in evolving, was largely inspired by Duchenne, whom Charcot called his "master in neurology." 
The American neurologist Dr. Joseph Collins (1866–1950) wrote that Duchenne found neurology, "a sprawling infant of unknown parentage which he succored to a lusty youth."
His greatest contributions were made in the myopathies that came to immortalize his name, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne-Aran spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne-Erb paralysis, Duchenne's disease (Tabes dorsalis), and Duchenne's paralysis (Progressive bulbar palsy). He was the first clinician to practise muscle biopsy, the harvesting of in vivo tissue samples with an invention he called, "l'emporte-pièce" (Duchenne's trocar).This device was described by Gowers as 'Duchenne's histological harpoon,' and by others as a 'miniature harpoon' - metonymy that alluded to his parentage by the sea. 
In 1855 he formalized the diagnostic principles of electrophysiology and introduced electrotherapy  in a textbook titled, De l'electrisation localisée et de son application à la physiologie, à la pathologie et à la thérapeutique. 
A companion atlas to this work titled, Album de photographies pathologiques, was the first neurology text illustrated by photographs.  Duchenne's monograph, Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine – also illustrated prominently by his photographs – was the first study on the physiology of emotion and was seminal to Darwin's later work.

[[Conical surface]]

CATEGORIES: Euclidean solid geometry, Surfaces, Algebraic surfaces, Quadrics

In geometry, a (general) conical surface is the unbounded surface formed by the union of all the straight lines that pass through a fixed point — the apex or vertex — and any point of some fixed space curve — the directrix — that does not contain the apex.  Each of those lines is called a generatrix of the surface. 
Every conic surface is ruled and developable.  In general, a conical surface consists of two congruent unbounded halves joined by the apex.  Each half is called a nappe, and is the union of all the rays that start at the apex and pass through a point of some fixed space curve.  (In some cases, however, the two nappes may intersect, or even coincide with the full surface.) Sometimes the term "conical surface" is used to mean just one nappe.
A cylindrical surface can be viewed as a limiting case of a conical surface whose apex is moved off to infinity in a particular direction. Indeed, in projective geometry a cylindrical surface is just a special case of a conical surface.

[[Electronic band structure]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic band structures, Solid state engineering

In solid-state physics, the electronic band structure (or simply band structure) of a solid describes those ranges of energy that an electron within the solid may have (called energy bands, allowed bands, or simply bands), and ranges of energy that it may not have (called band gaps or forbidden bands). Band theory derives these bands and band gaps by examining the allowed quantum mechanical wave functions for an electron in a large, periodic lattice of atoms or molecules. Band theory has been successfully used to explain many physical properties of solids, such as electrical resistivity and optical absorption, and forms the foundation of the understanding of all solid-state devices (transistors, solar cells, etc.).

The Irish Brigade was an infantry brigade, consisting predominantly of Irish Americans, that served in the Union Army in the American Civil War. The designation of the first regiment in the brigade, the 69th New York Infantry, or the "Fighting 69th", continued in later wars. The Irish Brigade was known in part for its famous war cry, the "faugh a ballagh", which is an anglicization of the Irish phrase, fág an bealach, meaning "clear the way".  According to Fox's Regimental Losses, of all Union army brigades, only the 1st Vermont Brigade and Iron Brigade suffered more combat dead than the Irish Brigade during America's Civil War.

This relation is attributed to Max Born (1925),[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF01328531|noedit[/tpl] who called it a "quantum condition" serving as a postulate of the theory;  it was noted by E. Kennard (1927)[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF01391200|noedit[/tpl] to imply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

In mathematics and classical mechanics, canonical coordinates are sets of coordinates which can be used to describe a physical system at any given point in time (locating the system within phase space). Canonical coordinates are used in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics. A closely related concept also appears in quantum mechanics; see the Stone–von Neumann theorem and canonical commutation relations for details.
As Hamiltonian mechanics is generalized by symplectic geometry and canonical transformations are generalized by contact transformations, so the 19th century definition of canonical coordinates in classical mechanics may be generalized to a more abstract 20th century definition of coordinates on the cotangent bundle of a manifold.

Caleb is a fictional character played by Nathan Fillion in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer created by Joss Whedon. The character is a sadistic sociopath with a pathological hatred of women.  
According to Whedon, the character was introduced because the mutable, non-corporeal nature of the First Evil "meant that we didn't really have anything to push against. We needed... a sidekick. Somebody physical that we can see from episode to episode." Whedon describes him as "the creepiest priest", adding, "he is the most bald-faced misogynist we've had since, well, since last year, with Warren."[ref]

Jerry N. Schneider (born circa 1951) is a social engineer and security consultant. While still in high school in 1968, Schneider started a company called "Creative Systems Enterprises" and began selling his own invented electronic communication devices. Schneider obtained parts by scavenging from Pacific Telephone and Telegraph's dumpsters. During this scavenging, he built up a collection of PTT documents including invoices and training manuals. After a few years, he reportedly knew more about PTT's procedures than its own employees.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.boe.ca.gov/legal/pdf/80-sbe-094.pdf | title="Appeal of Jerry N Schneider" |format=PDF[/tpl]
1970–1971: Schnieder expanded his telephone wholesale business while majoring in Electrical Engineering in college.
June, 1971: Schneider started a plan to acquire new telephone equipment from PTT, market it as "refurbished," and sell it through CSE, his own company. The exact details of his scam are currently not available. He also acquired equipment from Western Electric Company in a similar manner. He sold equipment back to Pacific and to others.
January, 1972: A former employee of CSE (presumably disgruntled) tips off law enforcement. Police raid  CSE's offices and warehouse. The District Attorney estimates the found equipment is worth $8,000. At this time, they learn that Schneider had made off with $125,000 worth of gear. Schneider later admits to nearly $900,000.
He was arrested on February 8, 1972. Contemporary newspapers rate his caper as one of the most famous computer crimes in history.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]
After plea bargaining, Schneider eventually pleaded guilty on May 15, 1972 to one count of grand theft of $5,000 worth of equipment. In July 1972, he was sentenced to two months in a minimum security facility. He only served forty days and paid a $500 fine.
1972: Schneider, at 21, formed a security consultancy that targeted companies wishing to protect themselves from computer criminals. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]
November 26, 1974: Date of final judgement of civil suit from PTT. Suit stated that Schneider had stolen equipment valued at $214,649.63, and that equipment valued at $73,452.81 had been returned.
1977: Schneider left the security consulting firm.

Among her many soap opera credits were her roles as alcoholic actress Lynn Franklin on From These Roots (1958–1961); Claire English Lowell Cassen Shea #4 on As the World Turns (1965–1971); Barbara Norris Thorpe #2 on Guiding Light (1971–1981; she reprised the role for a few episodes in 1989 and on a recurring basis from 1995–1996); and Scottish nanny Bridget Connell on Another World (1985–1996).  Berjer is one of the few actors in daytime history to be featured on two soaps at the same time ("Guiding Light" and "Another World", both Procter & Gamble-owned shows).
She was born as Barbara Berger, but as her surname was so often mispronounced as "burger", she changed it to "Berjer", which is how it is pronounced phonetically. [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]

Kirby & the Amazing Mirror is also an adventure-based game, rather than a linear side-scroller. This game bears similarities to The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords also published by Nintendo and released around the same time. Both are  multiplayer adventure games that use the concept of the main character being split into four color coded individuals and having to work together to solve puzzles. The difference between them is that Kirby is a sidescrolling platformer game rather than isometric. The game was re-released in Europe for Club Nintendo members only.

[[Connection form]]
CATEGORIES: Differential geometry, Fiber bundles, Connection (mathematics)

In mathematics, and specifically differential geometry, a connection form is a manner of organizing the data of a connection using the language of moving frames and differential forms.
Historically, connection forms were introduced by Élie Cartan in the first half of the 20th century as part of, and one of the principal motivations for, his method of moving frames.  The connection form generally depends on a choice of frame, and so is not a tensorial object.  Various generalizations and reinterpretations of the connection form were formulated subsequent to Cartan's initial work.  In particular, on a principal bundle, a principal connection is a natural reinterpretation of the connection form as a tensorial object.  On the other hand, the connection form has the advantage that it is a differential form defined on the differentiable manifold, rather than on an abstract principal bundle over it.  Hence, despite their lack of tensoriality, connection forms continue to be used because of the relative ease of performing calculations with them.[tpl]harvtxt|Griffiths|Harris|1978[/tpl] [tpl]harvtxt|Wells|1980[/tpl] [tpl]harvtxt|Spivak|1999[/tpl]  In physics, connection forms are also used broadly in the context of gauge theory, through the gauge covariant derivative.
A connection form associates to each basis of a vector bundle a matrix of differential forms.  The connection form is not tensorial because under a change of basis, the connection form transforms in a manner that involves the exterior derivative of the transition functions, in much the same way as the Christoffel symbols for the Levi-Civita connection.  The main tensorial invariant of a connection form is its curvature form.  In the presence of a solder form identifying the vector bundle with the tangent bundle, there is an additional invariant: the torsion form.  In many cases, connection forms are considered on vector bundles with additional structure: that of a fiber bundle with a structure group.

Cleveite was the first known terrestrial source of helium, which is created over time by alpha decay of the uranium and accumulates trapped (occluded) within the mineral. The first sample of helium was obtained by William Ramsay in 1895 when he treated a sample of the mineral with acid.http://www.archive.org/details/becquerelraysthe00raylrich Rayleigh, Robert and John Strutt, 1904, The Becquerel rays and the properties of radium, London, E.

San Gorgonio Mountain, also known locally as Mount San Gorgonio, or Old Greyback, is the highest peak in Southern California and the Transverse Ranges at [tpl]convert|11503|ft|m[/tpl]. It is in the San Bernardino Mountains, [tpl]convert|27|mi|km[/tpl] east of the city of San Bernardino and [tpl]convert|12|mi|km[/tpl] north-northeast of San Gorgonio Pass. It lies within the San Gorgonio Wilderness, part of the San Bernardino National Forest. Spanish missionaries in the area during the early 17th century named the peak after Saint Gorgonius.
Since it is the highest point in a region which is separated from higher peaks (e.g. in the Sierra Nevada) by relatively low terrain, San Gorgonio Mountain is one of the most topographically prominent peaks in the United States. It is ranked 7th among peaks in the 48 contiguous states[tpl]cite peakbagger |lid=41204 |name=USA Lower 48 Top 100 Peaks by Prominence |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl] and 18th among overall.[tpl]cite peakbagger |lid=41201 |name=USA Peaks with 6000 feet of Prominence |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl]
A large and broad mountain, it is not particularly craggy, and from a distance, it only appears to be a extremely high hill, earning it the name of greyback. Despite not being particularly striking in appearance during the summer, it is the only mountain in Southern California with a summit a significant distance above the tree line. As such its bright white winter snow cap, unobstructed by vegetation, makes the mountain noticeable from many miles away. The mountain hosts the longest line of sight in the contiguous United States; it is plainly visible from the summit of Mount Whitney, 190 miles away.Longest lines of sight

In mathematics, Parseval's theorem Parseval des Chênes, Marc-Antoine "Mémoire sur les séries et sur l'intégration complète d'une équation aux différences partielles linéaire du second ordre, à coefficients constants" presented before the Académie des Sciences (Paris) on 5 April 1799. This article was published in Mémoires présentés à l’Institut des Sciences, Lettres et Arts, par divers savans, et lus dans ses assemblées. Sciences, mathématiques et physiques. (Savans étrangers.), vol. 1, pages 638–648 (1806). usually refers to the result that the Fourier transform is unitary; loosely, that the sum (or integral) of the square of a function is equal to the sum (or integral) of the square of its transform.  It originates from a 1799 theorem about series by Marc-Antoine Parseval, which was later applied to the Fourier series.  It is also known as Rayleigh's energy theorem, or Rayleigh's Identity, after John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh.Rayleigh, J.W.S. (1889) "On the character of the complete radiation at a given temperature," Philosophical Magazine, vol. 27, pages 460–469.  Available on-line here. 
Although the term "Parseval's theorem" is often used to describe the unitarity of any Fourier transform, especially in physics and engineering, the most general form of this property is more properly called the Plancherel theorem.Plancherel, Michel (1910) "Contribution a l'etude de la representation d'une fonction arbitraire par les integrales définies," Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo, vol. 30, pages 298–335.

The first elections to select inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame were held in 1936. Members of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) were given authority to select individuals from the 20th century; while a special Veterans Committee, made up of individuals with greater familiarity with the 19th century game, was polled to select deserving individuals from that era. The intent was for 15 honorees to be selected before the 1939 ceremonies - 10 from the 20th century and 5 from the 19th; additional players from both eras would be selected in later years.[tpl]cite news| title=Naming the Immortals (editorial) | publisher=The Sporting News | date=January 2, 1936[/tpl] Voters were given free rein to decide for themselves in which group a candidate belonged, with neither group knowing the outcome of the other election; some candidates had their vote split between the elections as a result - Cy Young, the pitcher with most wins in Major League history, finished 8th in the BBWAA vote and 4th in the Veterans vote. In addition, there was no prohibition on voting for active players, a number of whom received votes. Individuals who had been thrown out of baseball - such as Shoeless Joe Jackson and Hal Chase - were also not formally excluded, though few voters chose to include them on ballots.
In the BBWAA election, voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates, the same number of desired selections; in the Veterans' election, voters were also instructed to vote for 10, although the desire for only 5 initial selections led to revisions in the way the votes were counted.[tpl]cite news| title=In the Press Box | publisher=The Sporting News | date=January 9 & 16, 1936[/tpl] Any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots in either election would be honored with induction to the Hall upon its opening in the sport's supposed centennial year of 1939.

Langlet was born in Södertälje. From 1886 to 1896, he studied chemistry under Per Teodor Cleve at Uppsala University, where he obtained a doctorate in 1896, and was made docent in the same year. In 1899, he became lecturer in Chemistry and Chemical Technology at the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, where he received a professorship in the same field in 1911. From 1926, when his professorship was divided, he was professor of Organic Chemistry. 
In 1895, while working with Cleve in Uppsala, he made the independent discovery of the element helium (in the same year discovered by William Ramsay) in the mineral cleveite. Langlet was the first to correctly define its atomic weight.  He died in Gothenburg.

When opened in 1757, it ran along the valley of the Sankey Brook from the point where the brook joined the River Mersey, to a location to the north east of St Helens.[tpl]cite web|title=History, Opening of the canal|url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/sankey/sa2.htm|accessdate=2013-01-01[/tpl][tpl]Coord|53.3512|-2.7303|region:GB_scale:5000[/tpl] Extensions were constructed at the Mersey end of the canal, firstly to Fiddlers Ferry and then to Widnes, while at the northern end, it was extended into what became the centre of St Helens. The canal was gradually abandoned between 1931 and 1963, but has been the object of a restoration attempt since 1985, when the Sankey Canal Restoration Society was formed.

New Silesia ([tpl]lang-de|Neuschlesien[/tpl] or Neu-Schlesien) was a small province of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1795 to 1807, created after the Third Partition of Poland. It was located northwest of Kraków and southeast of Częstochowa, in the lands that had been part of the Silesian Duchy of Siewierz and the adjacent Polish historical province of Lesser Poland (the Kraków Voivodeship), including the towns of Żarki, Pilica, Będzin, and Sławków.
New Silesia had its capital at Siewierz. However, it was originally to be governed by the Silesian capital Breslau (Wrocław) and later largely administered by South Prussia. After the defeat of Prussia in the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, the province was dissolved and the territory was made part of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw in the Treaties of Tilsit of 1807.

The Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met[tpl]#tag:ref|The company promoted itself as "The Met" from about 1914. The Railway is referred to as "the Met" or "the Metropolitan" in historical accounts such as [tpl]harvnb|Jackson|1986[/tpl], [tpl]harvnb|Simpson|2003[/tpl], [tpl]harvnb|Horne|2003[/tpl], [tpl]harvnb|Green|1987[/tpl] and [tpl]harvnb|Bruce|1983[/tpl].|group="note"[/tpl]) was a passenger and goods railway that served London from 1863 to 1933, its main line heading north-west from the capital's financial heart in the City to what were to become the Middlesex suburbs. Its first line connected the main-line railway termini at [tpl]stnlnk|Paddington[/tpl], [tpl]stnlnk|Euston[/tpl] and [tpl]stnlnk|King's Cross[/tpl] to the City. It was built beneath the New Road using the "cut-and-cover" method between Paddington and King's Cross and in tunnel and cuttings beside Farringdon Road from King's Cross to near Smithfield, near the City. It opened to the public on 10 January 1863 with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives, the world's first underground railway.[tpl]sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=8[/tpl]
The line was soon extended from both ends, and northwards via a branch from Baker Street. It reached Hammersmith in 1864, Richmond in 1877 and completed the Inner Circle in 1884, but the most important route was the line north into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. Harrow was reached in 1880, and the line eventually extended to [tpl]stnlnk|Verney Junction[/tpl] in Buckinghamshire, more than [tpl]convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off[/tpl] from Baker Street and the centre of London.
Electric traction was introduced in 1905 and by 1907 electric multiple units operated most of the services, though electrification of outlying sections did not occur until decades later. Unlike other railway companies in the London area, the Met developed land for housing, and after World War I promoted housing estates near the railway using the "Metro-land" brand. On 1 July 1933, the Met was amalgamated with the Underground Electric Railways Company of London and the capital's tramway and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board.
Former Met tracks and stations are used by the London Underground's Metropolitan, Circle, District, Hammersmith & City, Piccadilly and Jubilee lines, and by Chiltern Railways.

A magic square is in Frénicle standard form, named for Bernard Frénicle de Bessy, if the following two conditions apply:
Frénicle's  published book of 1693 described all the 880 essentially different order-4 magic squares. 
This standard form was devised since a magic square remains "essentially similar" if it is rotated or transposed, or flipped so that the order of rows is reversed — there exists 8 different magic squares sharing one standard form. For example, the following magic squares are all essentially similar, with only the final square being in Frénicle standard form:

The Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway was a U.S. railroad company incorporated on July 18, 1902, by David H. Moffat, Walter S. Cheesman, William Gray Evans, Charles J. Hughes, Jr., George E. Ross-Lewin, S.M. Perry and Frank P. Gibson. After Denver was bypassed by the Union Pacific line, which passed through Cheyenne, Wyoming, and by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW), which was routed through Pueblo, Colorado, and ran west through Royal Gorge. The Denver business community wanted an "Air Line" west of the city, and the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway was going to be that "Air Line", originating in Denver, and was planned to terminate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Although the line was never completed as a separate route to Salt Lake City, the line was eventually connected with the D&RGW's main near Dotsero and used to shorten their route between Salt Lake City and Denver. The line initially featured an arduous grade over Rollins Pass. After the pass was bypassed by the Moffat Tunnel, the line became known as the Moffat Tunnel Route.
DNW&P was placed in receivership on May 2, 1912, and on April 30, 1913, was reformed as the Denver and Salt Lake Railroad, and finally the Denver and Salt Lake Railway [tpl]reporting mark|D&SL[/tpl] in 1926. Most of the line is in use today as part of the Union Pacific's Central Corridor.

David (1981), The Wolf: The Ecology and Behaviour of an Endangered Species, University of Minnesota Press, p. 352, ISBN 0-8166-1026-6 is a possible subspecies of gray wolf native to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island. It is a medium-sized subspecies, distinguished from the northwestern wolf by its smaller size, its whiter coloration, its narrower braincase,Goldman, E. A. (1964). Classification of wolves. In The Wolves of North America Part 2. Young, S. P. & Goldman, E. A. (Eds.) New York: Dover Publs. p. 430. and larger carnassials.Clutton-Brock, J., A. C. Kitchener, & J. M. Lynch. (1994) Changes in the skull morphology of the Arctic wolf, Canis lupus arctos, during the twentieth century. Journal of Zoology (London) 233:19–36. Since 1930, there has been a progressive reduction in size in Arctic wolf skulls, which is likely the result of wolf-dog hybridization.
Contrary to its mainland counterparts, the Arctic wolf has never been seriously hunted or pursued, as the high Arctic holds few human settlements. As a result, the Arctic wolf is relatively unafraid of people, and can be coaxed to approach people in some areas.Mech, L. D., Arctic Wolves and Their Prey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, May 30, 2007 It has occasionally acted aggressively toward humans. Otto Sverdrup wrote that during the Fram expidition, a pair of wolves attacked one of his team-mates, who defended himself with a skiing pole.Sverdrup, O. N., (1918), New land; four years in the Arctic regions, Vol. I, London Longmans, Green, pp. 431-432 In 1977, a pair of scientists were approached by six wolves on Ellesmere Island, with one animal leaping at one of the scientists and grazing a cheek. A number of incidents involving aggressive wolves have occurred in Alert, Nunavut, where the wolves have lived in close proximity to the local weather station for decades and become habituated to humans.Linnell, J.D.C., et al (2002), The Fear of Wolves: A Review of Wolf Attacks on Humans, NINA, pp. 29-31, ISBN 82-426-1292-7
The Arctic wolf was first described as a distinct subspecies by British zoologist Reginald Pocock in 1935, after having examined a single skull from Melville Island. [tpl]As of|2005|uc=on[/tpl],[tpl]MSW3 Wozencraft | pages = | id =14000743[/tpl] the Arctic wolf is still recognized as a distinct subspecies by MSW3. However, studies undertaken on Arctic wolf autosomal microsatellite DNA and mtDNA data indicate that the Arctic wolf has no unique haplotypes, thus indicating that its colonization of the Arctic Archipelago from the North American mainland was relatively recent, and thus not sufficient to warrant subspecies status.[tpl]cite journal |title=An account of the taxonomy of North American wolves from morphological and genetic analyses |authors=Chambers SM, Fain SR, Fazio B, Amaral M |year=2012 |journal=North American Fauna |volume=77 |pages=1–67 |url=http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/pdf/10.3996/nafa.77.0001 |accessdate=2013-07-02 [/tpl]

Elfdalian developed from the ancient original Scandinavian language, Old Norse, a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during the Viking Age, until about 1300. It developed in relative isolation since the Middle Ages and is considered to have remained closer to Old Norse than the other Dalecarlian dialects.

The first actress to play her daughter on the show, Alexandra Wilson, was only twelve years younger than Holbrook herself. Alexandra Wilson was replaced by Amy Carlson in 1993.
She won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress award for her role as Sharlene in 1996.
Holbrook has appeared in numerous guest starring roles on Law and Order and Law and Order SVU. Appeared in the film "I Love Trouble" with Nick Nolte. She has also appeared in off Broadway and regional theater.
She has also done numerous national commercials and voice overs. In 2003 and 2004, she was seen in advertisements for Claritin allergy pills.

[[Suffixaufnahme]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar, German words and phrases

Suffixaufnahme (German for "suffix-absorption") is a linguistic phenomenon used in forming a genitive construction, whereby prototypically a genitive noun agrees with its head noun. It was first recognized in Old Georgian and some other Caucasian and ancient Middle Eastern languages as well as many Australian languages, and almost invariably coincides with agglutinativity.
A subject, for instance, would be marked with a subjective affix as well as a genitive affix. So, for example, in Old Georgian perx-ni k'ac-isa-ni (foot-NOM.PL man-GEN-NOM.Pl), the genitival noun phrase agrees in case (nominative) and number (plural) with the head noun.  
However, while a possessive construction such as this is most frequently found in Suffixaufnahme, other nominal constructions may also show similar behavior. In Old Georgian, a postpositional phrase modifying a noun could take on that noun's case and number features:  "Ra turpa prinvelia!" c'amoidzaxa 'ert-ma bavshv-ta-gan-ma' child-GEN.PL-from-NARR, ("'What a wonderful bird!' exclaimed one of the children") where the narrative case -ma on ertma is copied onto the modifying postpositional phrase headed by -gan.

CATEGORIES: Dalarna, Horses in art, Swedish culture, Traditional toys, Wooden toys, Toy animals

A Dalecarlian horse or  Dala horse (Swedish: Dalahäst)p is a traditional carved, painted wooden horse statuette originating in Swedish province Dalarna.  In the old days the Dala horse was mostly used as a toy for children; in modern times it has become a symbol of Dalarna, as well as Sweden in general. Several different types of Dala horses are made, with distinguishing features common to the locality of the site where they are produced. One particular style has, however, become much more common and widespread than others. It is stoutly carved and painted bright red with details and a harness in white, green, yellow and blue.

Schroeder is a fictional character in the long-running comic strip Peanuts, created by Charles M. Schulz. He is distinguished by his precocious skill at playing the toy piano, as well as by his love of classical music and the composer Ludwig van Beethoven in particular. Schroeder is also the catcher on Charlie Brown's baseball team, though he is always seen walking back to the mound with the baseball, never throwing it—admitting in one strip he didn't want the other team to discover his lack of ability. He is also the object of the unrequited infatuation of Lucy van Pelt, who constantly leans on Schroeder's piano, much to Schroeder's annoyance. Charlie Brown, Frieda and Snoopy are also occasionally depicted as leaning on Schroeder's piano.
After Linus and Snoopy, Schroeder is probably Charlie Brown's closest friend; he once angrily berated Violet for giving Charlie Brown a used valentine well after Valentine's Day had come and gone, only to be undercut when Charlie Brown eagerly accepted it. Schroeder also joined Linus in dressing down the girls (Lucy, Patty, Violet and Frieda) and Snoopy in Charlie Brown's All-Stars, when it was discovered Charlie Brown wouldn't sacrifice the girls and Snoopy just to get uniforms for the baseball team. He also is one of the few players who has any respect for Charlie Brown as a manager; though he is as capable of ire at Charlie Brown's poor performance as anyone else, such instances are few and far between. In one game, when Frieda desperately asked Schroeder "Wouldn't you like just once to see Charlie Brown hit that ball?", Schroeder's calm reply was "No, I am not prepared to have the world come to an end".
Schroeder was voted an honorary member of the Epsilon Iota chapter at Florida State University of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity, the oldest and largest music fraternity in the world. A stained glass window in New York's Buffalo Westminster Presbyterian Church honoring Albert Schweitzer has a corner showing Him playing his toy piano.  In honor of Schroeder's passion for Beethoven, the Charles M. Schulz Museum (Santa Rosa) and the Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies announced the launching in December 2009 of a permanent online exhibit of 60 of the 300 Schulz's cartoons that involve Schroeder and Beethoven: "Schulz's Beethoven, Schroeder's Muse" (accessible through the website www.americanbeethovensociety.org).

Zombies Ate My Neighbors is a run and gun video game developed by LucasArts and originally published by Konami for the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis consoles in 1993.
One or two players take control of protagonists Zeke and Julie in order to rescue the titular neighbors from monsters often seen in horror movies. Aiding them in this task are a variety of weapons and power-ups that can be used to battle the numerous enemies in each level. Various elements and aspects of horror movies are referenced in the game with some of its more violent content being censored in various territories such as Europe and Australia, where it is known only as Zombies.
While not a massive commercial success, the game has been well received for its graphical style, humor and deep gameplay. It spawned a sequel, Ghoul Patrol, released in 1994. In 2009, Zombies Ate My Neighbors was re-released for the Virtual Console to positive reviews.

The River Wandle is a river in south-east England. The names of the river and of Wandsworth are thought to have derived from the Old English "Wendlesworth" meaning "Wendle's Settlement".  The river runs through southwest London and is about [tpl]convert|9|mi|km[/tpl] long. It passes through the London Boroughs of Croydon, Sutton,  Merton, and Wandsworth to join the River Thames on the Tideway at Wandsworth.  Much of the River is accessible using the Wandle Trail.
Rain falls on the North Downs, filters through the chalk and emerges on the spring line.  At the top of the catchment the river is mostly culverted.  The river is first visible at Wandle Park in Croydon where it flows in an open channel before returning to a culverted section between the New South Quarter development and Waddon Ponds beside Mill Lane.  A second main source, also at about [tpl]convert|115|ft[/tpl] AOD is formed at Carshalton Ponds, which merges underneath Watermill House in the northern area of Carshalton, The Wrythe.
Other sources include the Norbury Brook/River Graveney tributary which rises near the Lower Addiscombe Road in Croydon and flows through the London Boroughs of Croydon, Lambeth and Merton.  Two seasonal streams, the Coulsdon Bourne and the Caterham Bourne, run in wet winters.  They join together at Purley, run in a culvert north along the Brighton Road and join the River Wandle at the site of the, now defunct, Swan and Sugarloaf pub in South Croydon.

David Conner "Dave" Treen, Sr. (July 16, 1928 – October 29, 2009), was an American attorney and politician from Mandeville, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana – the first Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Louisiana since Reconstruction. He was the first Republican in modern times to have served in the U.S. House of Representatives from his state. 
A narrow victor in the gubernatorial general election held in 1979, Treen served as governor from 1980–84. He lost his bid for reelection in 1983 to his long-time rival, Democrat Edwin Edwards. He served in Congress from 1973 to 1980. Treen grew up as a Democrat, but became a Republican in 1962 when there were only about ten thousand registered Republicans in the state.

[[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1937]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1937 in baseball

The 1937 process of selecting inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame was markedly different from the initial elections the previous year. As only half of the initial goal of 10 inductees had been selected in 1936, members of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) were once again given authority to select any players active in the 20th century; but the unsuccessful 1936 Veterans Committee election for 19th-century players led to a smaller Centennial Commission choosing a handful of inductees whose contributions were largely as non-players.
In the BBWAA election, voters were again instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates, but were now discouraged from casting votes for active players (though some player-managers whose playing days were largely over, such as Rogers Hornsby, received votes). Any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall upon its opening in the sport's supposed centennial year of 1939. Again, individuals who had been barred from baseball were not formally ineligible; Hal Chase received some votes, though Shoeless Joe Jackson did not.

One Tree Hill (also known as Maungakiekie) is a [tpl]convert|182|m|ft|adj=on[/tpl] volcanic peak in Auckland, New Zealand. It is an important memorial place for both Māori and other New Zealanders. The suburb around the base of the hill is also called One Tree Hill; it is surrounded by the suburbs of Royal Oak to the west, and clockwise, Epsom, Greenlane, Oranga, and Onehunga. The summit provides views across the Auckland area, and allows visitors to see both of Auckland's harbours.One Tree Hill (from the Auckland volcanic field website of the Auckland Regional Council)
The hill's scoria cones were erupted from three craters – one is intact and two have been breached by lava flows that rafted away part of the side of the scoria cone. Lava flows went in all directions, many towards Onehunga, covering an area of [tpl]convert|20|km2[/tpl], making it the second largest (in area covered) of the Auckland volcanic field, behind Rangitoto Island. The age of eruption is currently unknown, but it is older than 28,500 years as it has a mantling of volcanic ash erupted at that time from Three Kings volcano.[tpl]cite book |last1=Hayward |first1=Bruce W. |last2=Murdoch |first2=Graeme |last3=Maitland |first3=Gordon |title=Volcanoes of Auckland: The Essential Guide |year=2011 |publisher=Auckland University Press |isbn=978-1-86940-479-6 [/tpl]
Due to the use of the hilltop as a nightly party stop for boy racers and other (often drunk) groups of youths, it was decided in 2008 to close off the road access to the summit at night. While walking up to the hilltop will still be possible at night, it is hoped that this move will reduce vandalism.

Constantia Jones (born c.1708 – December 22, 1738) was a prostitute in London, UK during the term of Prime Minister Robert Walpole, who was sentenced to hang for stealing 36 shillings and a half-guinea (the equivalent of about £300 today) from one of her clients. Her accuser, describing her as "a three-penny upright," testified as follows: "As I stood against the Wall, she came behind me, and with one hand she took hold of . . . --and the other she thrust into my Breeches Pocket and took my Money." Based on this testimony, Jones was sentenced to hang at Tyburn.
Jones, who had been sent to the notorious prison at Newgate some twenty times before, was 30 years old upon her execution. Historian Peter Linebaugh asserts that regardless of her guilt or innocence, her conviction on such flimsy evidence indicates the bias of 18th-century English courts against the trade of prostitution and those who worked in the industry.  Prostitutes are always vulnerable, and in the middle of the 18th century in England, their testimony in court was not regarded as equal to that of their clients.  Jones would have been a particularly weak defendant, as she had been in Newgate on multiple occasions.  Although officially London courts took all persons as equally worthy, class distinctions were still operative, and therefore testimony from a "gentleman," in particular, would weigh heavily.  At the same time, prostitutes were extremely common and were generally tolerated.  Prostitution gangs also operated, and some gangs included "toughs" and "bullies," who would attack the prostitutes' clients for robbery.
Whether Jones robbed her client or not, she would have faced a high barrier in court.  What may be more remarkable about her case than her conviction is the testimony presented against her.  Solicitation was a dubious act, and the clients of prostitutes were unlikely to go to the police to give evidence.  Those patrons of prostitutes with money to steal were usually jealous of their social standing and would not go to the justices.

[[Andalusian Arabic]]
CATEGORIES: Medieval languages, Arabic languages, Languages of Spain, Extinct languages of Europe, Al-Andalus

Andalusian Arabic (also known as Andalusi Arabic, Spanish Arabic, Hispano-Arabic) was a variety of the Arabic language spoken in Al-Andalus, the regions of the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal) under Muslim rule. It became an extinct language in Iberia after the expulsion of the Moriscos, which took place over a century after the Conquest of Granada by Christian Spain. Andalusi Arabic is still used in Andalusi music and has significantly influenced the dialects of such towns as Sfax in Tunisia, Fez, Rabat, Nedroma, Tlemcen, Blida, Cherchell,.http://www.alyamiah.com/cema/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=499 It is still used by communities of the descendants of Moriscos (Andalusi Muslims) in cities like Tangiers and Tetouan in Morocco and Testour, Ghar al Milh and Sfax in Tunisia which welcomed Moriscos refugees. It also exerted some influence on Mozarabic, Spanish (particularly Andalusian), Ladino, Catalan, Portuguese, Berber and the  Moroccan, Tunisian and Algerian Arabic dialects.
Andalusian Arabic appears to have spread rapidly and been in general oral use in most parts of Al-Andalus between the ninth and fifteenth centuries. The number of speakers is estimated to have peaked at around 5-7 million speakers around the eleventh and twelfth centuries before dwindling as a consequence of the Reconquista, the gradual but relentless takeover by the Christians. In 1502, the Muslims of Granada were forced to choose between conversion and exile; those who converted became known as the Moriscos. In 1526, this requirement was extended to the Muslims elsewhere in Spain (Mudéjars). In 1567, Philip II of Spain issued a royal decree in Spain forbading Moriscos from the use of Arabic on all occasions, formal and informal, speaking and writing. Using Arabic in any sense of the word would be regarded as a crime. They were given three years to learn a "Christian" language, after which they would have to get rid of all Arabic written material. This triggered one of the largest Morisco Revolts. Still, Andalusian Arabic remained in use in certain areas of Spain until the final expulsion of the Moriscos at the beginning of the 17th century.Kees Versteegh, et al.: Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics, Brill Publishers, 2006.
As in every other Arabic-speaking land, the Andalusian people were diglossic, that is, they spoke their local dialect in all low-register situations, but only Classical Arabic was resorted to when a high register was required and for written purposes as well.
Andalusian Arabic belongs to Early Western Neo-Arabic, which does not allow for any separation between Bedouin, urban, or rural dialects, nor does it show any detectable difference between communal dialects, such as Muslim, Christian and Jewish.
The oldest evidence of Andalusian Arabic utterances can be dated from the 10th and 11th century, in isolated quotes, both in prose and stanzaic Classical Andalusi poems (muwashahat), and then, from the 11th century on, in stanzaic dialectal poems (zajal) and dialectal proverb collections, while its last documents are a few business records and one letter written at the beginning of the 17th century in Valencia.[tpl]ref|BRILL[/tpl]

Descended from the spoken Arabic brought to Egypt during the seventh-century AD Muslim conquest, its development was influenced by the indigenous Coptic of pre-Islamic Egypt,Nishio, Tetsuo.

The 80 million Egyptians speak a continuum of dialects, among which Cairene is the most prominent. It is also understood across most of the Arab World due to the predominance of Egyptian media, making it the most widely spoken and one of the most widely studied varieties of Arabic.

While it is essentially a spoken language, it is encountered in written form in novels, plays, poems (vernacular literature), as well as in comics, advertising, some newspapers, and transcriptions of popular songs.
In most other written media and in television news reporting, Literary Arabic is used. Literary Arabic is a standardized language based on the language of the Quran, i.e. Classical Arabic. The Egyptian vernacular is almost universally written in the Arabic alphabet for local consumption, although it is commonly transcribed into Latin letters or in the International Phonetic Alphabet in linguistics text and textbooks aimed at teaching non-native learners. Also, it is written in ASCII Latin alphabet mainly online and in SMSs.

Manitoba Telecom Services ([tpl]tsx|MBT[/tpl]), or MTS, formerly Manitoba Telephone System, is the primary telecommunications carrier in the Canadian province of Manitoba and the fourth largest telecommunications provider in Canada[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mts.ca/mts/about+mts+allstream/our+company/corporate+profile|title=Corporate Profile|accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl] with over 5000 employees. It provides local and long-distance phone services, television service, Internet service and wireless services including digital PCS, cellular, and paging. Manitoba Telecom Services is the publicly traded holding company; It currently has two operating subsidiaries; MTS Inc. and Allstream Inc.
MTS is the descendant company of Manitoba Government Telephones which went into operation in January 1908 after the government of Manitoba bought Bell Canada's Manitoba operations.  The Crown corporation became Manitoba Telephone System in 1921, and eventually absorbed all private telephone operations in the province. In 1996, the Provincial government of Premier Gary Filmon decided to sell the Manitoba Telephone System to private shareholders. The decision to privatize was seen as controversial, as it marked a significant departure from the Progressive Conservatives' earlier position that MTS should remain provincially owned.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publicvalues.ca/ViewArticle.cfm?Ref=004|title=Public Values - Manitoba Telephones, ten years later|accessdate=2010-04-13[/tpl]

Yemeni Arabic can be divided roughly into several main dialect groups, each with its own distinctive vocabulary and phonology. The most important of these groups are San'ani, Ta'izzi-Adeni (South Yemeni Arabic or Djibouti Arabic[tpl]cite web|title=Arabic, Ta’izzi-Adeni Spoken|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/acq|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl]), Tihami and Hadhrami (Hadrami).

Yemeni Arabic is used for daily communications and has no official status, instead, Modern Standard Arabic is used in official purposes, in education, commerce, and media, especially in countries where Arabic is not the lingua franca.

[[Wellington Street (Ottawa)]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Ottawa

Wellington Street (French: Rue Wellington) is an major street in Ottawa, notable for being one of the first two streets laid out in Bytown in 1826 (the other being the eastern leg of Wellington, Rideau Street), but also because of the adjacent Parliamentary Precinct. The street runs from Booth Street to the Rideau Canal where it connects with Rideau Street and delimits the northern border of the downtown core.  It is named after the Duke of Wellington, in recognition of his role in the creation of the Rideau Canal, and therefore of Ottawa (see History of Ottawa).http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/featured/building-the-rideau-canal
Starting at its easternmost point, Wellington forms the northern edge of Confederation Square, south of which runs Elgin Street.  West of Confederation Square, Parliament Hill can be found on its north side, while the Langevin Block, home of the Prime Minister's Office and of the Privy Council Office, the former American embassy and the Wellington Building can be found to the south. West of the intersection with Bank Street, are located the Confederation Building and the Justice Building (still considered within the Parliamentary Precinct), while the headquarters of the Bank of Canada can be found opposite the Hill.
Beyond Parliament Hill, the Supreme Court of Canada is situated west of the Justice building, and opposite St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church. The East and West Memorial Buildings can be seen next, respectively standing east and west of Lyon Street and linked by the Memorial Arch. West of the Supreme Court is the National Library and Archives of Canada main building, with the Garden of the Provinces across the street. Between the Supreme Court and the National Library is a large open area that is today a mix of park land and large parking lots. Until the 1970s this was home to a cluster of temporary buildings that had been erected in the Second World War to provide much needed office space. In the 1970s there was a plan to build both a home for the Federal Court and the National Gallery. A design competition was even held for the National Gallery, but in the end the government cancelled both projects. [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Wellington Street continues west past the Portage Bridge, north of the eastern half of the Lebreton Flats, and becomes the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway after crossing Booth Street.
West of the Ottawa O-Train Bayview station, a separate segment (originally an extension of the same street) is known as Wellington Street West, and passes through the Hintonburg and Island Park neighbourhoods before becoming Richmond Road at Island Park Drive.
Both sections of Wellington are four-lane historic urban arterial roads with a speed limit of 50 km/h (30 mph), although the flow is generally even slower than that due to high pedestrian traffic.
A number of proposals have been made to change the street's name (to honour Sir John A. Macdonald or Pierre E. Trudeau, for example), some as recent as 2010.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2010/05/10/wellington-change.html
From Bronson Avenue until Rideau Street, Wellington is also known as Ottawa Road #34. From Western Avenue to Somerset Street, Wellington is known as Ottawa Road #36.

[[Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency]]

CATEGORIES: Education in Pennsylvania

The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, or "PHEAA", headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with regional offices throughout the state, is the quasi-governmental agency  that administers several State higher education student financial aid programs. 
Created in 1963 by the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Today, PHEAA is a national provider of student financial aid services, serving millions of students and thousands of schools through its loan guaranty, loan servicing, financial aid processing, outreach and other student aid programs. 
It administers the grant program for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and serves as a coordinating body for other grant programs administered by other state agencies. It also serves as one of several student loan guarantors in the United States for the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), under the Higher Education Act of 1965.  It also has a loan servicing operation, for student loans that it owns and for lenders under contract. From a small student loan guarantor with approximately 5,000 student loans in 1964, it now manages more than $100 billion in total assets and serves nearly four million students through its various programs The agency has consistently been listed by the U.S. Department of Education as having one of the lowest default rates among all major guarantors through its highly successful default prevention initiatives.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]
PHEAA conducts its student loan servicing activities nationally as FedLoan Servicing and American Education Services (AES).
FedLoan Servicing was established in 2009 to support the U.S. Department of Education's ability to service student loans owned by the federal government. FedLoan Servicing is one of a limited number of organizations approved by the Department to service these loans.  AES was created to guarantee and service a variety of Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and private student loan products for lending partners throughout the nation. 
PHEAA’s earnings are used to support its public service mission and to pay its operating costs, including administration of the Pennsylvania State Grant and other state-funded student aid programs.  
As a quasi-governmental agency, AES/PHEAA's board of directors consists of members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the Secretary of Education and gubernatorial appointees. The legislative members of the Board were successful in passing legislation that restructures the PHEAA Board of Directors, which was signed into law by the Governor on July 9, 2010.  This legislation was based on a PHEAA Board resolution that called upon the General Assembly to replace legislative seats on the Board with new private-sector individuals who could provide additional leadership expertise in an increasingly complex financial environment.  Specifically, the legislation reduces the number of lawmakers serving on the 20-member Board from 16 to 12. The four legislative seats will be replaced with private-sector professionals with experience in banking, investments and information technology; adding their expertise to the decisions that the Board makes on behalf of Pennsylvania students and families. The legislation also reduces the six-year Board term to four years. 
In October, 2007, Jack Wagner,  the Pennsylvania auditor-general released a report accusing the agency of giving excessive bonuses and incentives.   Rep. Bill Adolph, chairman of the agency’s board, subsequently scheduled an emergency meeting of the board for Wednesday, October 10, to request the early resignation of the President of the agency, Richard E. Willey,"As Pheaa Faces Scathing New Report, President Moves Up Departure Date" Chronicle of Higher Education October 4, 2007 based on reporting from the Pittsburgh News-Tribune and the Associated Press.
Since 2007, PHEAA has undergone a series of reforms and cost-cutting initiatives including the elimination of management bonuses, automatic salary increases and all sponsorships and advertisements that were not in line with PHEAA’s mission. The Board also instituted one of the nation’s strictest business and travel expense reimbursement policies. Those reforms resulted in more than $77 million in savings."PHEAA has a fresh start, important federal contract" Harrisburg Patriot News July 22, 2010

[[Waterspout]]

CATEGORIES: Weather, Weather hazards, Severe weather and convection, Tornado, Vortices

A waterspout is an intense columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over a body of water, connected to a cumuliform cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.  Waterspouts do not suck up water; the water seen in the main funnel cloud is actually water droplets formed by condensation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schwiesow|first=R.L.|coauthors=Cupp, R.E., Sinclair, P.C., Abbey, R.F.|title=Waterspout Velocity Measurements by Airborne Doppler Lidar|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|date=April 1981|volume=20|pages=341–348|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450%281981%29020%3C0341%3AWVMBAD%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=11 August 2013|bibcode = 1981JApMe..20..341S |doi = 10.1175/1520-0450(1981)0202.0.CO;2 [/tpl] While many waterspouts form in the tropics, other areas also report waterspouts, including Europe, New Zealand, the Great Lakes and Antarctica.[tpl]cite news |publisher=BBC News |title= Several waterspouts filmed on Lake Michigan in US | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19315824 | date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Taylor|first=Stanley|title=Antarctic Diary|url=http://antarcticdiary.wordpress.com/part-4/|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl]  Although rare, waterspouts have been observed in connection with lake-effect snow precipitation bands.

The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was a NASA-operated orbital observatory whose mission was to study the Earth’s atmosphere, particularly the protective ozone layer. The [tpl]convert|5900|kg|lb|adj=on[/tpl] satellite was deployed from Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-48 mission on 15 September 1991. It entered Earth's orbit at an operational altitude of [tpl]convert|600|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl], with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees.
The original mission duration was to be only three years, but was extended several times. When the mission finally ended in June 2005 due to funding cuts, 14 years after the satellite's launch, six of its ten instruments were still operational.W. Henry Lambright, 2005. NASA and the Environment: The Case of Ozone Depletion, "The UARS controversy" p 43f. A final orbit-lowering burn was performed in early December 2005 to prepare the satellite for deorbit.

The decommissioned satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere on 24 September 2011. Considerable media attention surrounded the event, largely due to NASA's predictions that substantial parts of the satellite might reach the ground, potentially endangering inhabited areas.

The Charter of the International Military Tribunal – Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis (usually referred to as the Nuremberg Charter or London Charter) was the decree issued on 8 August 1945 that set down the laws and procedures by which the Nuremberg trials were to be conducted.
The charter stipulated that crimes of the European  Axis Powers could be tried. Three categories of crimes were defined: crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 8 of the charter also stated that holding an official position was no defense to war crimes. Obedience to orders could only be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determined that justice so required.
The criminal procedure used by the Tribunal was closer to civil law than to common law, with a trial before a panel of judges rather than a jury trial and with wide allowance for hearsay evidence. Defendants who were found guilty could appeal the verdict to the Allied Control Council. In addition, they would be permitted to present evidence in their defense and to cross-examine witnesses. 
The Charter was developed under the authority of the Moscow Declaration: Statement on Atrocities, which was agreed at the Moscow Conference (1943). It was drawn up in London, following the surrender of Germany on VE Day. It was drafted by Robert H. Jackson, Robert Falco, and Iona Nikitchenko of the European Advisory Commission, and issued on August 8, 1945.Charter of the International Military Tribunal - Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis. United Nations Refugee Agency
The Charter and its definition of crimes against peace was also the basis of the Finnish law, approved by the Finnish parliament on 11 September 1945, that enabled the war-responsibility trials in Finland.
The Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis and the annexed Charter were formally signed by France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States on 8 August 1945. The Agreement and Charter were subsequently ratified by 19 other Allied states.Ratifications.

Peter Nicholls (born 1939) is an Australian literary scholar and critic. He is the creator and a co-editor of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (with John Clute).
Born in Melbourne, Victoria, he spent two decades (from 1968 to 1988) as an expatriate, first in the US, and then the UK.
Nicholls' early career was as a literary academic, originally with The University of Melbourne. He first travelled to the US in 1968 on a Harkness fellowship, and his significant contributions to science fiction scholarship and criticism began in 1971, when he became the first Administrator of the Science Fiction Foundation (UK), a position he held until 1977. He was editor of its journal, Foundation: The Review of Science Fiction from 1974-8.
In 1979, Nicholls edited The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (published in the US as The Science Fiction Encyclopedia), with John Clute as associate editor. Most of its 730 thousand words were written by Nicholls, Clute and two contributing editors. At the time, this was widely perceived as the most comprehensive and sophisticated critical survey of the entire science fiction field ever attempted. It won the 1980 Hugo Award in the Nonfiction Book category. A completely revised, updated, and greatly expanded version of the Encyclopedia, co-edited with Clute, was published in 1993, and won the 1994 Hugo in the same category.  A further updating of the work, with revisions and corrections, was later issued in CD-ROM format. The third edition, with Clute and David Langford, was released online as a beta text in October 2011.
Nicholls' other major publications include the following: Science Fiction at Large (1976; reprinted 1978 under the title Explorations of the Marvellous), a collection of essays edited by Nicholls from a 1975 symposium; The Science in Science Fiction (1983) edited by Nicholls and written by him with David Langford and Brian M. Stableford; and Fantastic Cinema (1984; published in the US as The World of Fantastic Films).
A film on his interest and work in science fiction, titled The What-If Man was completed.
Nicholls is the father of five children. His daughter is author and editor Sophie Cunningham, although they were not close for many years. He currently lives in Melbourne with his wife, Clare Coney, and his two youngest sons, Jack and Luke.

CATEGORIES: Card games introduced in 1996, Collectible card games, Erotic comics, Studio Foglio titles

XXXenophile is an American comic book series, published by Palliard Press and later Studio Foglio.  It is an anthology of short, whimsical, erotic fantasy and science fiction stories, written and penciled by Phil Foglio.  Each story is inked by a different artist.
XXXenophile was originally published as a series of ten comic books from 1989 to 1995. In 1994, the contents of the first five issues were reprinted in The XXXenophile Big Book O' Fun. In 1997 and 1998, the contents of the ten issues were reprinted in the five-volume The XXXenophile Collection series; each volume contained a number of stories from the original comics (not in their original publication order) plus a new story (generally a second look at characters from an earlier story such as the superhero Orgasm Lass and her four-armed male sidekick Foreplay). The additional stories were compiled separately in a final, eleventh issue of the comic book in 1998.  A sixth volume of The XXXenophile Collection, with a new 64-page story, was published in 2000. In 2004 Studio Foglio released XXXenophile Quick and Dirty, a 20-page booklet of previously unreleased material. Currently, the series is presently on hiatus on the initiative of the Foglios until their children are of appropriate age for the material.
The series' general emphasis is on the enjoyment of sexuality as a playful activity.  Foglio satirizes numerous plot elements of fantasy and science fiction, such as time travel, cloning, robots, deals with the devil, love potions, and geasa.  It portrays a variety of sexual activities, including "oral sex, anal sex, group sex, masturbation, voyeurism, double penetration, inter-racial (literally), bestiality (although generally with an animal possessing intelligence), mild sado-masochism, homosexuality (female, in every issue; male, just in the last issue), exhibitionism, sex with any number of devices, necrophilia (or sex with a ghost, anyway), prostitution, and every single position and combination imaginable, including some that were only possible in micro-gravity".[ref]
</ref>  Foglio cited rape, mind control, pedophilia, "classical necrophilia", excretion, snuff porn, branding, piercing, heavy sadomasochism, and spanking as topics that he did not find appealing and would not write about.<ref name="HI"/>
Palliard Press published a related series, XXXenophile Presents, which presented stories by other creators, each story taking up an entire issue.  There were five issues published, with stories by Julie Ann Sczesny, Colin Upton (two), and Charlie Wise (two).The Phil Foglio Gallimaufry 2 - Works as the Writer/Scripter/Editor only

Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets is studied. It is a multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as climatology.
The composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as volcano emissions, lightning and bombardment by solar particles from corona. It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain, ozone depletion, photochemical smog, greenhouse gases and global warming. Atmospheric chemists seek to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.

[[Ikat]]

CATEGORIES: Indonesian art, Dyes, Figured fabrics, Textile arts

Ikat, or Ikkat, is a dyeing technique used to pattern textiles that employs a resist dyeing process  on either the warp or weft fibres prior to weaving.
Bindings, which resist dye penetration, are applied to the threads in the desired patterns and the threads are dyed. Alteration of the bindings and the dyeing of more than one color produce elaborate, multicolored patterns. When all of the dyeing is finished the bindings are removed and the threads are ready to be woven into cloth.
The defining characteristic of ikat is the dyeing of patterns, by means of bindings, into the threads before cloth construction, the weaving of the fabric, takes place.  Herein lies the difference between ikat and other resist-dyeing techniques such as tie-dye and batik, where the resist is applied to whole cloth. In tie-dye the fabric is woven first and the resist bindings are then applied to the fabric which is dyed.

Mount Kembla [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|m|b|l|ə[/tpl] is a mountain in New South Wales, Australia, as well a semi-rural township of Wollongong, which gets its name from the mountain. 
Kembla is an Aboriginal word meaning "plenty of game". 
It is a coal mining area, notable for the Mount Kembla Mine disaster of 1902 in which 96 people lost their lives. 
Four sub-areas are often classified collectively as "Mount Kembla": Kembla Heights, Windy Gully, Cordeaux Valley and Kembla Village (known formerly as American Creek and Violet Hill, respectively). 
Mount Kembla Village is considered the "main" village. The village includes a local primary school, church and graveyard, several hundred houses and the Mount Kembla Hotel, which was built in 1896. The general store/post office closed in 2010, making it the first time in 145 years the village has been without one. The village also has a heritage centre showcasing local history, emphasizing the mining disaster. An annual Heritage Festival and 96 Candles Ceremony, commemorating the victims of the mine disaster, have been performed consistently every year since the disaster. The village is accessible from Wollongong, via Cordeaux Road, named after early settlers; and from Mount Keira via Harry Graham Drive. The small village of Kembla Heights is to the northwest, reached by Harry Graham Drive. 
The Mount Kembla Colliery was established in 1883, and the purpose-built township was constructed by the company to house the employees. The community thrived until late-1970 when the mine closed and the town went into decline, losing its general store, post office, Presbyterian church, tennis courts and public telephones during the following years. 
BHP Billiton is a mining/steel export company which owns substantial property on and around Mount Kembla. It is currently mining at the Dendrobium site, half a kilometre west of the village. 
Mount Kembla is joined to the west by the Illawarra escarpment and, in particular, a mass with two lower summits, Kembla West (512 m) and Mount Burelli (531 m). The mountain forms a prominent peak pointing approximately eastward.

Barbara Ann Coleman (née Ryan, formerly Stenbeck, St. Clair, Dixon, Munson and Montgomery) is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera As the World Turns. In the early 1970s, Barbara was played by a succession of actresses, but the actress most associated with the role is Colleen Zenk, who played her since September 1, 1978. Better known as simply Barbara Ryan she is portrayed as a heroine who experienced many tragedies, mostly at the hands of her controlling ex-husband, the villanous James Stenbeck (Anthony Herrera).
Over her 32 years on the show, Barbara has been shot through the heart, nearly gored by a bull in Spain, kidnapped 15 times, married nine times, burned in a chemical explosion and jumped out of a three-story window.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ynhh.org/vSiteManager/Upload/Docs/ImpactSummer08.pdf|title=Colleen Zenk Pinter: My Experience at YNHH|work=Impact|publisher=Yale-New Haven Hospital|date=Summer 2008|accessdate=December 30, 2102[/tpl]
Originally characterised as the hard-hearted daughter of Jennifer Sullivan, Barbara was transformed when writer Douglas Marland came on board at ATWT in 1985. He decided made Barbara a "bitch" of sorts, and had her break up long standing couple Tom Hughes and Margo Montgomery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2010/09/zenk2.html|title=Colleen Zenk: The We Love Soaps Interview, Part Two|publisher=We Love Soaps|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=December 30, 2012[/tpl] This proved to be unpopular, and Marland quickly reverted the character back to being "good" by pairing Barbara with Oakdale police detective (and later chief) Hal Munson (Benjamin Hendrickson).  Again, in the early 2000s (decade), writer Hogan Sheffer turned Barbara back into a scheming villain. Burned up in a chemical explosion in 2001 with the actress donning special effects make-up for a full year,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0IW9vJmYCw&feature=related|title=InFANity: As the World Turns - Part 5 (HQ)|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=December 30, 2012[/tpl] Barbara returned to her evil ways and culminated in her committing crimes such as drugging a police officer and hiring a hit man to murder Rose D'Angelo (Martha Byrne).

Though the character has since reformed and become a more or less law-abiding presence in Oakdale, she can still be manipulative and devious when she feels she needs to be.
Entertainment reporter Lisa Joyner described the character as a "sultry vixen" who'd made the transition from "helpless victim to scheming villain," whilst TV Guide's Michael Logan called the character Oakdale's "firecracker."[tpl]cite web|last=Logan|first=Michael|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/World-Turns-Zenk-1023097.aspx|title=As the World Turns Gives Colleen Zenk a Fitting Farewell|work=TV Guide|date=September 15, 2010|accessdate=December 30, 2012[/tpl]

Monsignor, pl. monsignori, is an honorific form of address for those members of the clergy of the Catholic Church who receive from the pope certain ecclesiastical honorific titles granted to individuals who have rendered valuable service to the Church or who provide some special function in church governance or who are members of bodies such as certain chapters. The title is never bestowed on those classified as religious in Catholicism. Although in some languages the word is used as a form of address for bishops, which is indeed its primary use in those languages, this is not customary in English.Catholic Education Resource Center, "How to Address Church Officials" Monsignor is the apocopic form of the Italian monsignore, from the French mon seigneur, meaning "my lord".

"Monsignor" is a form of address, not an appointment: properly speaking, one cannot be "made a monsignor" or be "the monsignor of a parish". The title or form of address is associated with certain papal awards, which Pope Paul VI reduced to three classes: those of Protonotary Apostolic, Honorary Prelate, and Chaplain of His Holiness.
Apart from those working in the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See, it is usually on the proposal of the local bishop that the Pope grants this title to Catholic diocesan clergy. The grant is subject to criteria of the Holy See that include a minimum age.
Soon after his election in March 2013, Pope Francis suspended the granting of the honorific title of Monsignor except to members of the Holy See's diplomatic service.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.finesettimana.org/pmwiki/uploads/Stampa201309/130912giansoldati.pdf | title = Il Messaggero | date = 12 September 2013 | publisher = Fine settimana | format = PDF[/tpl].[tpl]Citation |date=Sep 2013 | url = http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2013/09/monsignor-moratorium.html | newspaper = The Tablet | publisher = Rorate Cæli | title = Pope scales back honorifics[/tpl]. In December of the same year he communicated his definitive decision to accept no further requests from bishops for appointments to any class but that of Chaplain of His Holiness, the lowest of the three classes, and that candidates presented must be at least 65 years old. He himself, during his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, never asked that any of his priests receive the title, and he was understood to associate it with clerical "careerism".[tpl]cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Gerard|title=Pope abolishes honorary title of monsignor for diocesan priests under the age of 65 |url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/31027/ |accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=Vatican Insider|date=4 January 2014[/tpl]

Appointments to all three classes of awards continue to be granted to officials of the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See, and there was no revocation of privileges granted to certain bodies such as chapters of canons whereby all their members or some of them have the rank of Protonotary Apostolic, Honorary Prelate or Chaplain of His Holiness.[tpl]Citation | title = Annuario Pontificio | year = 2013 | publisher = Vaticana | ISBN = 978-88-209-9070-1 | pages = 1846–48[/tpl].
Also unaffected is the association of the style with the office of vicar general, an appointment made by the bishop of the diocese, not by the Pope. Without necessarily being a protonorary apostolic, a diocesan priest has that titular rank as long as he remains in office.

[[Boris Polevoy]]
CATEGORIES: 1908 births, 1981 deaths, Russian writers, Soviet novelists, Soviet short story writers, Heroes of Socialist Labour, Socialist realism writers

Boris Nikolaevich Polevoy (or Polevoi) ([tpl]lang-ru|Бори́с Никола́евич Полево́й[/tpl]; March 17 4, 1908 – July 12, 1981) was a notable Soviet writer. He is the author of the book Story of a Real Man about a Soviet World War II fighter pilot Alexei Petrovich Maresiev (or Alexej Petrovich Maresjev). 
Boris Polevoy was a pseudonym for Boris Nikolaevich Kampov (1908–1981). He was born in Moscow in 1908, the son of a physician and a Jew, born "beyond the  Pale of Settlement." His parents were Nikolay Petrovich and Lidiya (Vasilyevna) Kampov. He was a graduate of the Tver Industrial Technical College (now Kalinin Industrial College)."Boris Nikolayevich Kampov," Contemporary Authors Online, Thomson Gale, 2007.
Prior to starting his career as a writer, he worked as a technologist at a textile factory in Kalinin. As he began his journalism career in 1928, his talents were such that he was chosen to be patronized by Maxim Gorky.
His nom de plume has several variations based on transliterations. He was thought to have chosen the name in homage to Nikolai Polevoy, a nineteenth-century Russian editor and writer known for writing historical novels very loosely based on facts.
Polevoy was said to have been a journalist, although more recently, he has been seen as a propagandist. "Polevoy had few equals in depicting German savagery or in glorifying Soviet heroism. His numerous writings on the war, published in the most influential newspaper of the USSR, not only epitomized Soviet propaganda but also influenced Soviet behavior," wrote Don Heddesheimer in The Journal of Historical Review.
He is perhaps best known for his reporting on the atrocities at Auschwitz soon after its liberation, which were the first to have been published in Pravda. His accounts reportedly differ from what others found, including a description of a conveyor belt that first electrocuted, then transported inmates' corpses into a furnace.
Polevoy began reporting for Pravda in 1939 or 1941.  At the time, he was still serving in the Red Army as a lieutenant colonel. He would eventually attain the rank of colonel. He continued as a war correspondent for the newspaper until 1945.
He married Yuliya Osipovna in 1939; the couple had two sons and a daughter.
Story about a True Man (also translated as Story of a Real Man), based on the life of Alexey Maresyev, was an immensely popular novel.Von Geldern, James and Richard Stites, eds. Mass Culture in Soviet Russia: Tales, Poems, Songs, Movies, Plays, and Folklore, 1917-1953, Indiana University Press, 1995. ISBN 0-253-32893-4 It was eventually made into an opera. It was first published in English in 1952, and was reprinted in 1970. The protagonist was also honored by having an asteroid named for him.Kaganovsky,  Lilya. “How the Soviet Man Was (Un)Made,” Slavic Review, Vol. 63, No. 3. (Autumn, 2004), pp. 577-596.
He also served as a deputy to Supreme Soviet Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (R.S.F.S.R.) from 1951 to 1966 and was a member of the Soviet Union Communist Party from 1940 until his death. As such he was involved in party politics as a member of various organizations. He was chief editor of the literary youth magazine Yunost (Юность) from 1962 until his death and was a board member of the Union of Soviet Journalists from 1959. He also served on the Soviet Peace Committee and Bureau World Peace Council.
For years, Polevoy exchanged a series of letters with Howard Fast, an American writer who had been a member of the Communist Party for 15 years, and best known as the author of Spartacus.Salisbury, Harrison E. "Writers in the Shadow of Communism: An exchange of letters between the American, Howard Fast, and a Soviet author indicates that communism cannot permit a writer to speak honestly, even to a friend," The New York Times Magazine, June 9, 1957, p.10 Reprinted at http://www.trussel.com/hf/shadow.htm The two had met briefly. Fast attempted to contact Polevoy when he decided to withdraw from the party, but there was no response from Polevoy. Fast decided to make his letters public. Polevoy eventually responded. Whether the delay was the result of the letters being intercepted or the result of Polevoy's reluctance to respond remains unclear.
Polevoy writes that when he received Fast's news, "that night I could not fall asleep. I kept thinking of your books. Their heroes crowded around me and together with them, as it were, I went over the whole situation. I felt sure that Gideon Jackson, who fought the good fight to the bitter end, would not have been less taken aback than I was by what happened. Neither would Spartacus, even if he did live at a time when there were neither the philosophical theories nor the practical experience that throw light over mankind's path today, a time without the cultural values of today or the progressive intellectuals bearing aloft the banner of peace at all circumstances." [ref]Salisbury, Harrison E. "Writers in the Shadow of Communism:
An exchange of letters between the American, Howard Fast, and a Soviet author indicates that communism cannot permit a writer to speak honestly, even to a friend," The New York Times Magazine, June 9, 1957, p.10 Reprinted at http://www.trussel.com/hf/shadow.htm[/ref] 
His popularity with Soviet readers never diminished. "Polevoy's books, articles, and political commentaries gained him an international readership well before the end of the war. He remained influential until his death in 1981, at which time he was secretary of the all-powerful Union of Soviet Writers," wrote Heddescheimer. "During his lifetime, Polevoy was named a Hero of Socialist Labor and awarded the Stalin Prize for literature, three Orders of Lenin, two Red Banners, the Red Star, and the Gold Medal of the World Peace Council."

Orber Moreno Aquiles mo-RAY-noh (born April 27, 1977) is a relief pitcher in Major League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. Moreno last played in the majors for the New York Mets (2003–2004). Previously, Moreno played for the Kansas City Royals (1999). He bats and throws right-handed.
Moreno throws a sharp slider, a changeup, a cutter and has a good command of his low-90s fastball. Moreno made his debut in the 1999 season, ranking as one of the top Royals prospects, but he injured his arm in an off-field accident and aggravated it by pitching. He had surgery performed and rehabbed in the Triple-A in 2002, and then he showed up out of shape from the long layoff. He was released and signed with the Mets before the 2003 season.
In January 2008, Moreno signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers, but was released during spring training. In February 2010, Moreno signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2010/02/odds-ends--6.html

Rubén Quevedo ru βen' ke βe' do (born January 5, 1979 in Valencia, Carabobo, Venezuela) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played with the Chicago Cubs (2000) and Milwaukee Brewers (2001–03). He batted and threw right-handed.
Quevedo was signed as a non-drafted free agent by the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and was traded to the Cubs in 1999. He played with the Cubs in 2000 and was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in 2001 for right-handed pitcher David Weathers. After three years with Milwaukee, Quevedo signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles in 2004. He appeared in one game for Baltimore's AA affiliate, the Bowie Baysox.
Quevedo's most effective pitch was his changeup, which he threw with the same arm motion as his 89 MPH fastball. Meanwhile, his slider and curve were average. He allowed a significant number of fly balls, resulting in a high number of home runs allowed.
In a four-year MLB career, Quevedo posted a 14–30 record with 237 strikeouts and a 6.15 ERA in 326.1 innings. During his minor league career he was named an AAA all-star in 2001 while pitching for the Iowa Cubs.

[[Attachment disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Attachment theory, Human development, Adoption, fostering, orphan care and displacement

Attachment disorder is a broad term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood, resulting in problematic social expectations and behaviors. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers after about 6 months of age but before about three years of age, frequent change of caregivers or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.
The term attachment disorder is most often used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, but is sometimes applied to school-age children or even to adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on the age of the individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality.Zeanah, 2005 No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.
There are currently two main areas of theory and practice relating to the definition and diagnosis of attachment disorder, and considerable discussion about a broader definition altogether. The first main area is based on scientific enquiry, is found in academic journals and books and pays close attention to attachment theory. It is described in ICD-10 as reactive attachment disorder, or "RAD" for the inhibited form, and disinhibited attachment disorder, or "DAD" for the disinhibited form. In DSM-IV-TR both comparable inhibited and disinhibited types are called reactive attachment disorder or "RAD".Chaffin et al. (2006) p78
The second area is controversial and considered pseudoscientific.[tpl]Cite book |author=Berlin LJ et al. |year=2005 |contribution=Preface |title=Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |editor=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT|series=Duke series in child development and public policy |publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-59385-470-6 | pages=xvii[/tpl] It is found in clinical practice, on websites and in books and publications, but has little or no evidence base. It makes controversial claims relating to a basis in attachment theory.Prior & Glaser p 183 The use of these controversial diagnoses of attachment disorder is linked to the use of pseudoscientific attachment therapies to treat them.
Some authors have suggested that attachment, as an aspect of emotional development, is better assessed along a spectrum than considered to fall into two non-overlapping categories. This spectrum would have at one end the characteristics called secure attachment; midway along the range of disturbance would be insecure or other undesirable attachment styles; at the other extreme would be
non-attachment.O'Connor & Zeanah, (2003) Agreement has not yet been reached with respect to diagnostic criteria.Chaffin et al. p. (2006)
Finally, the term is also sometimes used to cover difficulties arising in relation to various attachment styles which may not be disorders in the clinical sense.

Richard Marco Kovacevich, (born October 30, 1943) is retired chairman of the board of directors and previous CEO of Wells Fargo & Company. 
A native of Tacoma, Washington, he grew up in Enumclaw, Washington, a lumber town about 30 miles southeast of Seattle, where his father worked in the sawmill. His parents are Joseph Donald and Dorothy Kathryn. He married Mary Jo and fathered three children: Lori; Todd and Jennifer.American banker directory of U.S. banking executives, American Banker, 1980, p 315 At Stanford University he received BS and MS degrees in industrial engineering, followed by an MBA degree from Stanford Business School in 1967. Early in his corporate career he was a planning and division general manager with General Mills before joining Citicorp. 
At Citicorp he was made head of regional retail banking. Kovacevich was told by his team that Citibank had 30% market share but was losing 108 million dollars a year. Probing deeper, Kovacevich realized that they meant that Citibank had 30% checking account market share (in other words, 30 percent of all people who lived in the Citibank regions had a checking account with Citibank). In reality, Citibank only had 6% market share of deposits (the vast majority of money being in Savings and Loans, Credit Unions, and other institutions). Kovacevich expanded Citibank aggressively into other areas such as mortgages.
He then joined Norwest Bank as chief operating officer and head of the retail banking group in March 1986. At Norwest, Kovacevich confronted a similar situation. Norwest was mostly centered in Minnesota and Iowa at the time, with a relatively small population in both states. Kovacevich realized the only way he could keep growing the company would be to expand beyond banking services, into investment and insurance services as well. Kovacevich theorized that eventually it would be impossible for any bank to continuously grow if it did not do this.
Kovacevich instituted the new strategies while serving as president of Norwest from 1989, chief executive officer from 1993, and chairman from 1995.[ref]Richard L. Daft, Dorothy Marcic (2009): Understanding Management 6e, Sixth Edition, South Western Cengage Learning, Mason, OH, ISBN 0-324-56838-X, ISBN 978-0-324-56838-7, p 429
[tpl]Quote|Richard Kovacevich, who steered midsized Norwest Corp. (now Wells Fargo & Co.) through numerous acquisitions to make it one of the largest and most powerful banking companies in the United States, is an excellent example of a transformational leader. Kovacevich's leadership style puts accountability for success in the hands of each and every employee. He leads with slogans such as, "Mind share plus heart share equals market share." Although some people might think it sounds hockey, Kovacevich and his employees don't care.[/tpl][/ref] The higher revenues, relative to stable fixed costs which this method produced allowed Norwest to purchase many other banks, culminating with the 1998 purchase of Wells Fargo.  Although Norwest was the nominal survivor, the merged company retained the better-known Wells Fargo name.  After the merger, he was given the positions of president and CEO of Wells Fargo. In 2001 Kovacevich was elected chairman as well.
Kovacevich is responsible for many trends currently found in the financial services industry:
Kovacevich believes that Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance should be privatized, and that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should have no government backing in the event of a failure (quite the opposite of the course actually pursued by the United States Congress and the White House when the two lenders became insolvent in September 2008). He has also been very vocal against the expensing of stock options, and has twice disobeyed shareholder requests to do so.
He relinquished the presidency of Wells Fargo to John Stumpf in August 2005. On June 27, 2007, the board of directors elected Stumpf CEO, with Kovacevich retaining the chairmanship.
Besides Wells Fargo, Kovacevich is a director of Cargill, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., and Target Corporation. He is also vice president of the board of governors of the San Francisco Symphony, vice chairman of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and a member of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's California Commission on Jobs and Economic Growth, the National Infrastructure Advisory Committee, and the Financial Service Roundtable.
In the political realm, he has been a member of Pete Coors for Senate, Romney for President, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the New Leadership for America Political Action Committee.
In September 2009 Wells Fargo announced Kovacevich will step down as chairman and a director at the end of 2009 and retire from the company in early 2010 after 23 years with the company.

Haughton impact crater is located on Devon Island, Nunavut in far northern Canada. It is about [tpl]convert|23|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter and formed about 39 million years ago (late Eocene).[tpl]cite Earth Impact DB | name = Haughton| accessdate = 2009-08-19[/tpl] The impacting object is estimated to have been approximately [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter. Devon Island itself is composed of Paleozoic shale and siltstone overlying gneissic bedrock. When the crater formed, the shale and siltstone were peeled back to expose the basement; material from as deep as [tpl]convert|1700|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] has been identified. 
At 75° north latitude, it is one of the highest-latitude impact craters known. The temperature is below the freezing point of water for much of the year, and the limited vegetation is slow-growing, leading to very little weathering. For this reason Haughton retains many geological features that lower-latitude craters lose to erosion.  
Because Haughton's geology and climatology are as close to Mars-like as can be had on Earth, Haughton and its environs have been dubbed by scientists working there as "Mars on Earth." For example the center of the crater contains impact breccia (ejected rock which has fallen back into the impact zone and partially re-welded) that is permeated with permafrost, thus creating a close analog to what may be expected at crater sites on a cold, wet Mars. The Mars Institute and SETI operate the Haughton-Mars Project at this site, designed to test many of the challenges of life and work on Mars. The non-profit Mars Society also operates the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) at this site and conducts similar research.

[[Abolition of feudalism in France]]
CATEGORIES: 1789 events of the French Revolution

During the French Revolution, the National Constituent Assembly abolished feudalism on 4 August 1789, sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate (the nobility) and the tithes gathered by the First Estate (the Roman Catholic clergy).
While one can question motivations (and while many later expressed regrets and attempted retreat), historians agree that the Viscount de Noailles and the Duke d'Aiguillon proposed the redemption and consequent abolition of feudal rights and the suppression of personal servitude, as well as the various privileges of the nobility. Members of the First Estate were at first reluctant to enter into the patriotic fervour of the night but eventually the Bishops of Nancy and Chartres sacrificed their tithes. In the course of a few hours, France abolished game-laws, seigneurial courts, the purchase and sale of posts in the magistracy, of pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, of surplice money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions. Towns, provinces, companies, and cities also sacrificed their special privileges. A medal was struck to commemorate the day, and the Assembly declared Louis XVI the "Restorer of French Liberty."
This "Saint Bartholomew of abuses," as François Mignet calls it, has often been the subject of hyperbole in the analyses of contemporaries and historians. The atmosphere inside the Assembly was so heady that confusion reigned in the provinces for months afterwards as to the true meaning of the laws. The real product of the night was not formalised until the Feudal Committee reported back on 5 March 1790. The Committee reintroduced the mainmorte (explicitly outlawed by the original decrees) and set a rate of redemption for real rights (those connected to the land) that was impossible for the majority of peasants to pay. As the Russian anarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin would write, "The Assembly was carried away by its enthusiasm, and in this enthusiasm nobody remarked the clause for redeeming the feudal rights and tithes, which the two nobles and the two bishops had introduced into their speeches – a clause terrible even in its vagueness, since it might mean all or nothing, and did, in fact, postpone… the abolition of feudal rights for five years – until August 1793.Kropotkin, P.

Magic smoke (also factory smoke or blue smoke) is a humorous name for the very strong, caustic smoke produced by overheating electronic circuits or components. The smoke typically smells of burning plastic and other chemicals, and sometimes contains specks of sticky black ash. The color of the smoke depends on which component is overheating.
The name is a running in-joke that started among electrical engineers and technicians. It was more recently adopted by computer programmers. The joke's humor operates via the logical consistency of what is observed, versus knowledge of what is actually occurring. The device was operating until the smoke was released from it, at which point the device ceases to operate. Ergo: the smoke is an essential part of the device's operation, through undetermined ('magical') means.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/magic-smoke.html|title=Magic Smoke| accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl] This is an example of the fallacy Post hoc ergo propter hoc.

Sankardev created Sattriya Nritya as an accompaniment to the Ankia Naat (a form of Assamese one-act plays devised by him), which were usually performed in the sattras, as Assam's monasteries are called. As the tradition developed and grew within the sattras, the dance form came to be called Sattriya Nritya.Thakur, Sudarsha Cultural Reportage  Today, although Sattriya Nritya has emerged from within the confines of the sattras to a much wider recognition, the sattras continue to use the dance form for ritualistic and other purposes for which it was originally created circa 500 years ago.

Marvin John Heemeyer (October 28, 1951 – June 4, 2004) was a welder and an automobile muffler repair shop owner most known for his rampage with a modified bulldozer. Outraged over the outcome of a zoning dispute, he armored a Komatsu D355A bulldozer with layers of steel and concrete and used it on June 4, 2004, to demolish the town hall, the former mayor's house, and other buildings in Granby, Colorado. The rampage ended when the bulldozer got stuck in the basement of a Gambles store he had previously destroyed. Heemeyer then killed himself with a handgun.
Heemeyer had been feuding with Granby officials, particularly over fines for violating city ordinances and a zoning dispute regarding a concrete factory constructed opposite to his muffler shop that had caused his business to fail.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5139598/ |title=Man who bulldozed through Colo. town is dead |publisher=Msnbc.com |date=June 5, 2004 |accessdate=August 31, 2006[/tpl]

[[Paraphrase]]

CATEGORIES: Rhetoric

A paraphrase [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|f|r|eɪ|z[/tpl] is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. The term itself is derived via Latin [tpl]lang|la|paraphrasis[/tpl] from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|παράφρασις[/tpl], meaning "additional manner of expression".  The act of paraphrasing is also called "paraphrasis".
A paraphrase typically explains or clarifies the text that is being paraphrased. For example, "The signal was red" might be paraphrased as "The train was not allowed to pass because the signal was red". A paraphrase is usually introduced with verbum dicendi​—​a declaratory expression to signal the transition to the paraphrase. For example, in "The signal was red, that is, the train was not allowed to proceed," the that is signals the paraphrase that follows. 
A paraphrase does not need to accompany a direct quotation, the paraphrase typically serves to put the source's statement into perspective or to clarify the context in which it appeared. A paraphrase is typically more detailed than a summary. One should add the source at the end of the sentence, for example: When the light was red trains could not go (Wikipedia).
Paraphrase may attempt to preserve the essential meaning of the material being paraphrased. Thus, the (intentional or otherwise) reinterpretation of a source to infer a meaning that is not explicitly evident in the source itself qualifies as "original research," and not as  paraphrase.
Unlike a metaphrase, which represents a "formal equivalent" of the source, a paraphrase represents a "dynamic equivalent" thereof. While a metaphrase attempts to translate a text literally, a paraphrase conveys the essential thought expressed in a source text​—​if necessary, at the expense of literality. For details, see dynamic and formal equivalence.
The term is applied to the genre of Biblical paraphrases, which were the most widely circulated versions of the Bible available in medieval Europe.[tpl]cite journal|first=James H. |last=Morey |title=Peter Comestar, Biblical Paraphrase, and the Medieval Popular Bible |journal=Speculum |volume=68 |number=1 |date=January 1993 |pages=6–35[/tpl]  Here, the purpose was not to render an exact rendition of the meaning or the complete text, but to present material from the Bible in a version that was theologically orthodox and not subject to heretical interpretation, or, in most cases, to take from the Bible and present to a wide public material that was interesting, entertaining and spiritually meaningful, or, simply to abridge the text.
The phrase "in your own words" is often used within this context to imply that the writer has rewritten the text in their own writing style - how they would have written it if they had created the idea.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.open.ac.uk/skillsforstudy/writing-in-your-own-words.php | title=Writing in your own words | publisher=The Open University | accessdate=July 27, 2012[/tpl]

[[Northern Grey-headed Sparrow]]

CATEGORIES: Passer, Birds of Africa, Animals described in 1817, Birds of Cameroon

The Northern Grey-headed Sparrow (Passer griseus), also known as the Grey-headed Sparrow or Common Grey-headed Sparrow, is a bird species which is resident in much of tropical Africa. It occurs in a wide range of open habitats, including open woodlands and human habitation, often occupying the same niche as the House Sparrow does in Eurasia.
The adult Northern Grey-headed Sparrow has a pale grey head with a white moustache stripe, pale brown upperparts, whitish underparts and chestnut wings with a small white shoulder patch. The sexes are similar, but young birds are slightly duller and lack the white wing patch.
There are three subspecies, differing in plumage tone, especially with regard to the darkness of the head.
This sparrow is mainly resident in its range, but there is some seasonal movement, and flocks of up to 50 birds form outside the breeding season.
It builds a cup nest in trees, thatch, or old nests of other birds; 2–4 eggs are laid.
This species feeds principally on seeds and grain, like other sparrows, but will readily take insects including termites, especially when feeding young.
The calls include cheeps and chirps, and the typical sparrow churring alarm call.
The Northern Grey-headed Sparrow is replaced in eastern and southern Africa by very similar birds that are sometimes considered races of this species: Swainson's Sparrow, the Parrot-billed Sparrow, the Swahili Sparrow, and the Southern Grey-headed Sparrow.
The phylogeny has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al.[tpl]cite journal|last=Allende|first= Luis M.|coauthors=Rubio, Isabel; Ruíz-del-Valle, Valentin; Guillén, Jesus; Martínez-Laso, Jorge; Lowy, Ernesto; Varela, Pilar; Zamora, Jorge; Arnaiz-Villena, Antonio | year= 2001 | title= The Old World sparrows (genus Passer) phylogeography and their relative abundance of nuclear mtDNA pseudogenes | journal= Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume=53| pmid= 11479685 | pages= 144–154| url = http://chopo.pntic.mec.es/~biolmol/publicaciones/Passer.pdf |format = PDF| issue= 2|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110721034443/http://chopo.pntic.mec.es/~biolmol/publicaciones/Passer.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2011 | doi=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Arnaiz-Villena|first=A|coauthors= Gómez-Prieto P, Ruiz-de-Valle V|title= Phylogeography of finches and sparrows|journal=Nova Science Publishers|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-60741-844--3|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=13642[/tpl]

[[Neo-progressive rock]]

CATEGORIES: Progressive rock

Neo-progressive rock (or often shortened to neo-prog, not to be confused with the significantly more modern new prog) is a sub-genre of progressive rock, developed in the UK and popular in the 1980s, although it lives on today.
Neo-progressive rock is characterized by deeply emotional content, often delivered via dramatic lyrics and a generous use of imagery and theatricality on-stage. The music is mostly the product of careful composition, relying less heavily on improvised jamming. The subgenre relies very much on clean, melodic & emotional electric guitar solos, combined with keyboards. The main musical influences on the neo-prog genre are Genesis, Yes, Camel, Marillion and Pink Floyd.http://www.progarchives.com/subgenre.asp?style=18 Neo-progressive at Prog Archives
Early neo-prog was marked by sophisticated lyrics and often dark themes. While the accessibility of neo-prog by the mainstream is debatable, the form did generally seem more radio-friendly, with shorter tracks, than earlier progressive rock. Nonetheless, neo-prog never achieved the heights of popular success that the first wave of progressive rock in the 1970s did, with only one band, Marillion, achieving arena status.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gepr.net/genre2.html | title = A Guide To Progressive Rock Genres (section IV.B.11)[/tpl]
The early notable neo-prog albums included Fact and Fiction (1982) by Twelfth Night, Script for a Jester's Tear (1983) by Marillion, The Wake (1985) by IQ, and The Sentinel (1984) by Pallas.
In the book "The Progressive Rock Files", author Jerry Lucky dedicates a chapter on Neo-progressive rock with the title "A Neo Beginning!", stating that this sub-genre "surfaced in late 1981, bearing testimony to the lasting values of this musical form" of progressive rock, but distinguishing it from this main genre by going on to say that "Sure the sound was a bit different ... a little more bite, a little more eighties".
Later in the same book, Jerry Lucky suggested that this sub-genre of Progressive Rock peaked in the mid-1980s: "As 1984 dawned all of the British neo-progressive rock bands release material.  Marillion's second Fugazi, Pallas' The Sentinel, Pendragon's Fly High Fall Far, Twelfth Night's Art and Illusion, Solstice's Silent Dance, Quasar's Fire in the Sky and plenty of others including records from Haze Ce'st La Vie, Craft, Mach One Lost For Words, BJH Victims of Circumstance, The Enid The Spell, and others".
Marillion was the most popular neo-prog band, achieving major success across Europe in particular and producing eight top ten UK albums between 1983 and 1994, peaking in popularity with their album Misplaced Childhood in 1985, which topped the UK album chart and produced two top five hit singles in the UK. Following this peak, neo-prog declined as a mainstream genre, although these three pioneering bands are still active [tpl]As of|2009|lc=on[/tpl], and several newer groups have worked in the same space in the 1990s and 2000s.
By some fans of progressive rock, neo-prog is criticised for lacking originality compared to other progressive rock - even by such artists as Robert John Godfrey of The Enid,ProgRockMain whose own band has sometimes been promoted by neo-prog fans.

[[Internet Radio Linking Project]]

CATEGORIES: Amateur radio

The Internet Radio Linking Project, also called IRLP, is a project that links amateur radio stations around the world by using Voice over IP (VoIP). Each gateway consists of a dedicated computer running custom software that is connected to both a radio and the Internet. This arrangement forms what is known as an IRLP Node. Since all end users communicate using a radio as opposed to using a computer directly, IRLP has adopted the motto "Keeping the Radio in Amateur Radio".
Amateur radio (or ham) operators within radio range of a local node are able to use DTMF tone generators to initiate a node-to-node connection with any other available node in the world. Each node has a unique 4 digit node number in the range of 1000-8999. A real-time searchable list of all nodes worldwide (including their current status) is available anytime by viewing the IRLP Network at a Glance. As of June 2009, there are over 3,180 nodes across 7 continents.
IRLP connections are of two types: node to node, and node to reflector. Stations wishing to communicate with 3 or more nodes at the same time may accomplish this by connecting to what is called an IRLP Reflector. Reflectors are a type of conferencing system. Most reflectors on the network have 10 channels (0-9) with channel 0 being the main channel. Each reflector has a unique 4 digit node number in the range of 9000-9999. The first 3 digits consist of the reflector number, while the fourth digit represents the channel number. As of April 2007, there are 20 operational reflectors (including Echo Reflector 9990, which digitally records and plays back transmissions for testing purposes). Since most reflectors have 10 channels, there are approximately 200 unique reflector channels available for use.

The Battle of Stoney Creek was fought on 6 June 1813 during the War of 1812 near present day Stoney Creek, Ontario. British units made a night attack on an American encampment. Due in large part to the capture of the two senior officers of the American force, and an overestimation of British strength by the Americans, the battle was a victory for the British, and a turning point in the defence of Upper Canada.

[[Russell Road (Ontario)]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Ottawa, Roads in the United Counties of Prescott and Russell

Russell Road is a road in Eastern Ontario, Canada. 
Russell Road originally ran from Montreal Road in Ottawa along the east bank of the Rideau River and then bent east where Tremblay Road is now, and then south and east until the border of Clarence Township, Ontario (now the city of Clarence-Rockland) and the Township of Alfred and Plantagenet. 
However, three major intersection modifications have cut the road into 4 parts, and another shortened the Road substantially, making Russell Road arguably the most altered Road in Ottawa's history. Currently the Road begins at Industrial Avenue on the outskirts of the Riverview neighbourhood and runs southeast before ending at Smyth Road. (the road originally past Industrial Avenue to the north then jogged west at about where Tremblay Road is now, then north again along where North River Road is today and ended at Montreal Road). The road begins again near the Elmvale Shopping Centre, from Saint Laurent Boulevard, and runs south until it turns into Hawthorne Road. To keep going on Russell, one must make a left turn. 
This part of Russell Road continues to the community of Ramsayville, Ontario, where the road then ends at Ramsayville Road. To keep going on Russell Road, one must take a left on Ramsayville Road then a right. This jog was made to ensure that there was only one bridge under Highway 417. At this point Russell Road continues east through the communities of Carlsbad Springs, Ontario, Bearbrook, Ontario before leaving the city of Ottawa. It also passes through the communities of Cheney, Ontario and Bourget, Ontario in the City of Clarence-Rockland. The road was named because it was used by travellers, before the construction of Highway 417 as the route to get to Russell, Ontario from both Ottawa in the west and Bourget in the east. Russell Road for the majority of its length passes through rural surroundings. It is known Ottawa Road #26 from St. Laurent Boulevard until the City of Ottawa limits, and County Road #2 in Prescott and Russell County.

The name was changed however to Osgoode Main Street so as not to confuse it with the Main Street located a little closer to the city centre. Osgoode Main Street is actually located in the Town of Osgoode, Ontario, but is within the City of Ottawa jurisdiction due to a recent amalgamation. This consequently resulted in its name change. Osgoode Main Street serves as the Main Street of Osgoode, and it is also known as Ottawa Road #114. It runs from River Road in the west to Stagecoach Road in the east.

After having committed several felonies including armed robbery, he was arrested for three rapes on the Ohio State University campus. In the course of preparing his defense, psychologists diagnosed Milligan with multiple personality disorder.  His lawyers pleaded insanity, claiming that two of his alternate personalities committed the crimes without Milligan's being aware of it. He was the first person diagnosed with multiple personality disorder to raise such a defense.30 years later, multiple-personality case still fascinates A news from The Columbus Dispatch in 2007 about Milligan.

Teenoso (7 April 1980 – October 4, 1999) was an American-bred British Thoroughbred racehorse. After showing moderate form as a two-year-old he improved in the spring of 1983 to win the Group Three Lingfield Derby Trial and then won the Classic Epsom Derby, giving Lester Piggott a record ninth win in the race. Teenoso was beaten in his two remaining races that year but showed his best form as a four-year-old, winning the Ormonde Stakes, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and, on his final appearance, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He proved to be a disappointment at stud.

[[The Glorious Burden]]
CATEGORIES: 2004 albums, Concept albums, Iced Earth albums, SPV/Steamhammer albums

The Glorious Burden is a studio album by the American heavy metal band Iced Earth. It is a concept album, which explores various moments in military history, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolutionary War, and Waterloo.  It also pays tribute to world events such as World War I, the World Trade Center attacks and the ravages of Attila the Hun.  See the tracklist for links to the historical context of the songs.
The album includes a trilogy entitled Gettysburg (1863).  Each of the three songs represents one day in the Battle of Gettysburg, the largest battle ever conducted in the Western Hemisphere and considered the turning point in the American Civil War.Thinkquest.org page about Battle of Gettysburg
This album features the debut of lead singer Tim 'Ripper' Owens, formerly of Judas Priest. Owens, who at that time was still in Judas Priest, was asked to do the vocals as a side project. However, he joined the band full time after Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford. The album was first recorded with Matt Barlow on vocals, but band leader Jon Schaffer was not satisfied with his performance. Due to the events of September 11th, Barlow became more interested in law enforcement than the music business, and according to Schaffer "Matt's heart was not in it and it showed in his performance."Jon Schaffer explanation of Matt Barlow's departure.[tpl]Wayback |date=20040205100629 |url=www.icedearth.com/bandboard/messages/12.html [/tpl]  As a result, Matt left the band and the album was shelved until a new vocalist could be found. However, some of Barlow's initial recordings remain on the record as backing vocals, and he is credited with co-writing two songs.
This record is the only Iced Earth album to feature Ralph Santolla on lead guitars. This was the last studio album for bassist James MacDonough and drummer Richard Christy.
The album was released in 3 different formats: a limited edition 2-CD version in digipak format, an American version and a European version.Metal-Rules interview with Tim Owens. Jan. 26, 2004 See the tracklist for the differences.
"The Reckoning (Don't Tread on Me)", "Declaration Day", and the acoustic version of "When the Eagle Cries (Unplugged)" were all released as music videos.

[[Ichneumon (medieval zoology)]]
CATEGORIES: European legendary creatures, Legendary mammals, Fictional mustelids

In medieval literature, the ichneumon or echinemon was the enemy of the dragon. When it sees a dragon, the ichneumon covers itself with mud, and closing its nostrils with its tail, attacks and kills the dragon. The ichneumon was also considered by some to be the enemy of the crocodile and the asp, and attack them in the same way. The name was used for the "pharaoh's rat", mongoose, or Egyptian mongoose, which attacks snakes; it can also mean "otter".

[[Village Weaver]]
CATEGORIES: Ploceus, Animals described in 1766, Birds of Cameroon

The  Village Weaver  (Ploceus cucullatus), also known as the Spotted-backed Weaver or Black-headed Weaver (the latter leading to easy confusion with P. melanocephalus), is a species of bird found in much of sub-Saharan Africa. It has also been introduced to Hispaniola, Mauritius and Réunion.
This often abundant species occurs in a wide range of open or semi-open habitats, including woodlands and human habitation, and frequently forms large noisy colonies in towns, villages and hotel grounds.
This weaver builds a large coarsely woven nest made of grass and leaf strips with a downward facing entrance which is suspended from a branch in a tree. 2-3 eggs are laid. This is a colonial breeder, so many nests may hang from one tree.
The Village Weaver is a stocky 15–17 cm bird with a strong conical bill and dark reddish eyes. In the northern part of its range, the breeding male has a black head edged by chestnut (typically most distinct on the nape and chest). Towards the southern part of its range, the amount of black and chestnut diminish, and the breeding males of the southernmost subspecies only have a black face and throat, while the nape and crown are yellow. In all subspecies the breeding male has a black bill, black and yellow upperparts and wings, and yellow underparts.
The non-breeding male has a yellow head with an olive crown, grey upperparts and whitish underparts. The wings remain yellow and black.
The adult female has streaked olive upperparts, yellow and black wings, and pale yellow underparts. Young birds are like the female but browner on the back.
Village Weaver feeds principally on seeds and grain, and can be a crop pest, but it will readily take insects, especially when feeding young, which partially redresses the damage to agriculture.
The calls of this bird  include harsh buzzes and chattering.

[[Horror Show (album)]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 albums, Iced Earth albums

[tpl]Other uses|Horror Show (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Horror Show[/tpl]

Horror Show is the sixth studio album from the American heavy metal band Iced Earth, released June 26, 2001. It is a theme album based on classic monsters and horror-movie icons, including Dracula, Frankenstein, and the ghost from Phantom of the Opera. It was the first Iced Earth album to feature drummer Richard Christy, and the only album to feature Steve DiGiorgio on bass, though he did not tour with the band.  Horror Show is usually considered Iced Earth's only straightforward power metal release, as little of the thrash metal influence from the band's earlier works is present.  This album also featured more prominent usage of Matt Barlow's multi-layered vocals as a center point for the songs.
There was a special limited-edition 2CD set. The second CD featured the instrumental track "Transylvania" (an Iron Maiden cover) along with an interview with bandleader/rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer. There is also a single-disc version with "Transylvania", but without the interview. The song "Dracula" includes the line "the blood is the life", a quote from Deuteronomy 12:23. However, it is likely lifted from the 1992 version of Bram Stoker's Dracula which also features the line. As in "Dracula", many of the lyrics are lifted straight from the movies they were inspired by. Unlike other releases, it features much writing from Matt Barlow. 
By the end of the song "Damien" there is a section where Jon's reversed voice repeats the message that is also in the middle, silent section of the song. So, if the song is played backwards, the true message can be heard. This kind of reversed voice was also done by Iron Maiden by the beginning of their song "Still Life" of their fourth studio album "Piece of Mind".

Chief Rabbi is a title given in several countries to the recognised religious leader of that country's Jewish community, or to a rabbinic leader appointed by the local secular authorities.  Since 1911, through a capitulation by Rabbi Uziel, Israel has had two chief rabbis, one Ashkenazi and one Sephardi.[tpl]cite web|author=Cameron Brown |url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2000/issue4/jv4n4a3.html |title=Rabbi Ovadia Yosef And His Culture War in Israel |publisher=Meria.idc.ac.il |date= |accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl]
Cities with large Jewish communities may also have their own chief rabbis; this is especially the case in Israel but has also been past practice in major Jewish centers in Europe prior to the Holocaust. North American cities rarely have chief rabbis. One exception however is Montreal, with two—one for the Ashkenazi community, the other for the Sephardi.
The Chief Rabbi's name is often followed by ABD, which stands for Av Beth Din.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl]

It was the first game to blend a tag team style of combat with the Street Fighter gameplay, as well as incorporating elements from Capcom's previous Marvel-themed fighting games, X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes. It was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and PlayStation in 1998. However, the tag team feature was omitted from the PlayStation version due to memory limitations.

In medicine, portal hypertension is hypertension (high blood pressure) in the portal vein system, which is composed of the portal vein, and its branches and tributaries.
Portal hypertension is defined as elevation of hepatic venous pressure gradient to >5mmHg.  Generally, in clinical practice the pressure is not measured directly until the decision to place a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has already been made.  As part of that procedure, a hepatic vein wedge pressure is measured with the assumption of no pressure drop across the liver yielding portal vein pressure.

The MLC Centre is a skyscraper in Sydney, Australia. This office building is 228 metres (748 ft) high and has 60 storeys. It was designed by Sydney architect Harry Seidler, and remains one of his most definitive works. The building was awarded the Sir John Sulman medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.
The building is a stark white, modernist column in an octagonal floorplan, with eight massive load-bearing columns in the corners that taper slightly towards the top. It is one of the world's tallest reinforced concrete buildings and was the tallest building in the world outside North America at the time of its completion. The MLC Centre was Sydney's tallest office building from 1977 to 1992. The MLC Centre is jointly owned by the GPT Group and QIC. The MLC Centre was also Australia's tallest building for 9 years until losing the title to the Rialto Towers in Melbourne in 1986. 
Occupants include the Sydney Consulate of the United States of America. The podium of the building includes a shopping centre with several exclusive fashion labels and a 1,186 seat theatre, the Theatre Royal. The street address is 19-29 Martin Place Sydney.
The building is undergoing a $100m repair project which will install hybrid corrosion protection to the facade. The project is expected to retain the original appearance of the structure but remedy damage to exposed aggregate precast concrete facade panels caused by expansive corrosion of steel reinforcement.

Snoqualmie Falls is a 268 ft (82 m) waterfall on the Snoqualmie River between Snoqualmie and Fall City, Washington, USA. It is one of Washington's most popular scenic attractions, but is perhaps best known internationally for its appearance in the cult television series Twin Peaks. More than 1.5 million visitors come to the Falls every year, where there is a two acre (0.8 ha) park, an observation deck, and a gift shop. 
Most of the river is diverted into the power plants, but at times the river is high enough to flow across the entire precipice, which creates an almost blinding spray. High water occurs following a period of heavy rains or snow followed by warm rainy weather. This can occur during the rainy season which lasts from November through March. During high water, the falls take on a curtain form.
For the Snoqualmie People, who have lived for centuries in the Snoqualmie Valley in western Washington, Snoqualmie Falls is central to their culture, beliefs, and spirituality. A traditional burial site, to the Snoqualmie, the falls are "the place where First Woman and First Man were created by Moon the Transformer" and "where prayers were carried up to the Creator by great mists that rise from the powerful flow."[tpl]cite web| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2003698889&slug=nwwsalish100&date=20070510 |title=A look at Salish Lodge, Snoqualmie Falls' high-end hideaway |accessdate=2008-03-03 |last=Tazioli |first=Terry |date=2007-05-10 |work=Seattle Times[/tpl] The mists rising from the base of the waterfall are said to serve to connect Heaven and Earth.
The falls were first nominated for the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as a traditional cultural property for its association with the beliefs of the Snoqualmie people. However, the property owner, Puget Sound Energy, objected to the listing. The falls were subsequently determined eligible for listing in the National Register. The owners rescinded their objection and on September 2, 2009, the falls were formally listed in the National Register.

Challenging Times is a quiz show for teams representing higher education institutes in Ireland, both those in the Republic of Ireland and those in Northern Ireland.  It was televised by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) from 1991 to 2001, sponsored by The Irish Times, and presented by Kevin Myers, then a columnist with that newspaper.[ref]

The programme used a quizbowl format similar to that of University Challenge in the United Kingdom, which is itself a licensed version of the College Bowl format popular in the United States.

Fondue ([tpl]IPA-fr|fɔ̃ˈdy[/tpl]) is a Swiss, Italian, and French dish of melted cheese served in a communal pot (caquelon) over a portable stove (réchaud), and eaten by dipping long-stemmed forks with bread into the cheese. It was promoted as a Swiss national dish by the Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizerische Käseunion) in the 1930s, and was popularized in North America in the 1960s.
Since the 1950s, the name "fondue" has been generalized to other dishes in which a food is dipped into a communal pot of hot liquid: chocolate fondue, in which pieces of fruit are dipped into a melted chocolate mixture, and fondue bourguignonne, in which pieces of meat are cooked in hot oil.

The Volkswagen Fox is a city car produced and designed by Volkswagen of Brazil and sold in Latin America since 2004 and Europe since 2005. Currently the Fox is produced as a three-door and five-door hatchback. There is also a mini SUV version called CrossFox, and a mini MPV/station wagon model called Suran, SpaceFox, SportVan or Fox Plus depending on the market.
In South America, it fits between its two supermini brothers, the low cost Gol and the Polo. In Mexico it was called the Lupo, due to the last name of then-current President Vicente Fox. VW of Mexico dropped the Lupo after a short run of 2009 models due to poor sales and replaced it along with the aged Pointer and Derby by the VW Novo Gol. The SportVan has also been quietly discontinued starting February 2010 in Mexico due to poor sales leaving only the CrossFox.
In the European market, the Fox replaced the Lupo city car as the entry-level car in the lineup.
However now Volkswagen has stopped making the Fox in 2011 and it has now been replaced by the Volkswagen Up.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/volkswagen-world/faq/vehicle-information-model-changes |title=Model Changes |publisher=Volkswagen |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20[/tpl]
Like the contemporary Polo, the Fox is based on Volkswagen's PQ24 platform.
Volkswagen acquired the rights to the name in 1969 by purchasing NSU.   The original NSU Fox was a motor-bike first seen in 1949,[tpl]cite journal |authorlink=Klaus Westrup (Bernd Ostmann - Ed) |title=Not und Spiele: Die 50er Jahre... |journal=Auto, Motor und Sport |volume=Heft 13 1996 |pages=Seite 58–65 |date=14 June 1996[/tpl] and Volkswagen had subsequently used the "Fox" name in some markets for special edition Volkswagen Polos. The Audi 80 produced in the 1970s also used the name Fox on vehicles sold in Australia and the USA.

A minority language is a language spoken by a minority of the population of a territory. Such people are termed linguistic minorities or language minorities. With a total number of 193 sovereign states recognized internationally (as of 2008)ONU members and an estimated number of roughly 5,000 to 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, it follows that the vast majority of languages are minority languages in every country in which they are spoken. Some minority languages are simultaneously also official languages, including the Irish language in Ireland. Likewise, some national languages are often considered minority languages, insofar as they are the national language of a stateless nation.

Taylor Square is a locality in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Taylor Square is located beside a major road junction, where Oxford Street meets Flinders Street and Bourke Street. Taylor Square is also on the border of the suburbs of Darlinghurst and Surry Hills. The square sits above the tunnel section of the Eastern Distributor part of Metroad 1. The square is named after Sir Allen Taylor (1864-1940), a timber merchant, ship builder and Lord Mayor of Sydney who was responsible for the widening of Oxford Street during his tenure.[tpl]cite web|title=Allen Taylor|url=http://www.sydneyaldermen.com.au/alderman/allen-taylor/|work=Sydney's Aldermen|publisher=City of Sydney|accessdate=3 April 2013[/tpl]
The area formerly bound by the traffic of the three streets is popularly known as "Gilligan's Island" because of three large palm trees that once occupied the strip, but have since been subsequently removed. Construction of the Eastern Distributor also entailed the realignment of traffic flow in the area. Direct vehicle access across Oxford Street via Bourke Street is no longer possible. 
The locality is a centre of the city's nightlife, especially for its gay community. It features many pubs, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, cafes and shops.
Darlinghurst Courthouse is an imposing sandstone building on Taylor Square. It was designed by architect Mortimer Lewis (1796 - 1879) in 1844, and has a Greek Revival style facade. The central block is adapted from an 1823 design in Peter Nicholson's 'The New Practical Builder' (Apperly, Irving & Reynolds, 1989).

The Castillo de San Cristóbal is a Spanish fort in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It was built by Spain to protect against land based attacks on the city of San Juan. It is part of San Juan National Historic Site.
Castillo de San Cristóbal is the largest fortification built by the Spanish in the New World. When it was finished in 1783, it covered about 27 acres of land and basically wrapped around the city of San Juan. Entry to the city was sealed by San Cristóbal's double gates. After close to one hundred years of relative peace in the area, part of the fortification (about a third) was demolished in 1897 to help ease the flow of traffic in and out of the walled city.
This fortress was built on a hill originally known as the Cerro de la Horca or the Cerro del Quemadero, which was changed to Cerro de San Cristóbal in celebration of the Spanish victories ejecting English and Dutch interlopers from the island of this name in the Lesser Antilles, then forming part of the insular territorial glacis of Puerto Rico.

[[Brushless DC electric motor]]

CATEGORIES: DC motors, Electric motors

Brushless DC electric motor (BLDC motors, BL motors) also known as electronically commutated motors (ECMs, EC motors) are synchronous motors that are powered by a DC electric source via an integrated inverter/switching power supply, which produces an AC electric signal to drive the motor. In this context, AC, alternating current, does not imply a sinusoidal waveform, but rather a bi-directional current with no restriction on waveform. Additional sensors and electronics control the inverter output amplitude and waveform (and therefore percent of DC bus usage/efficiency) and frequency (i.e. rotor speed).
The rotor part of a brushless motor is often a permanent magnet synchronous motor, but can also be a switched reluctance motor, or induction motor.
Brushless motors may be described as stepper motors; however, the term stepper motor tends to be used for motors that are designed specifically to be operated in a mode where they are frequently stopped with the rotor in a defined angular position. This page describes more general brushless motor principles, though there is overlap.
Two key performance parameters of brushless DC motors are the motor constants Kv and Km (which are numerically equal in SI units).

[[Smithsonite]]

CATEGORIES: Carbonate minerals, Zinc minerals, Calcite group, Trigonal minerals

Smithsonite, or zinc spar, is zinc carbonate (ZnCO3), a mineral ore of zinc. Historically, smithsonite was identified with hemimorphite before it was realised that they were two distinct minerals. The two minerals are very similar in appearance and the term calamine has been used for both, leading to some confusion. The distinct mineral smithsonite was named in 1832 by François Sulpice Beudant in honor of English chemist and mineralogist, James Smithson (c.1765–1829), whose bequest established the Smithsonian Institution and who first identified the mineral in 1802.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/onehundredyears/featured_objects/smithsonite.html | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | title=Smithsonite at the National Museum of Natural History | accessdate=8 December 2010[/tpl]
Smithsonite is a variably colored trigonal mineral which only rarely is found in well formed crystals. The typical habit is as earthy botryoidal masses. It has a Mohs hardness of 4.5 and a specific gravity of 4.4 to 4.5. 
Smithsonite occurs as a secondary mineral in the weathering or oxidation zone of zinc-bearing ore deposits. It sometimes occurs as replacement bodies in carbonate rocks and as such may constitute zinc ore. It commonly occurs in association with hemimorphite, willemite, hydrozincite, cerussite, malachite, azurite, aurichalcite and anglesite. It forms two limited solid solution series, with substitution of manganese leading to rhodochrosite, and with iron, leading to siderite.

Jan Myrdal (born 19 July 1927 in Bromma, Stockholm) is a Swedish author, leftist-political writer and columnist. He is an honorary doctor of literature at Upsala College in New Jersey, US, and a PhD at Nankai University in Tianjin in China. He has lived at various times in the United States, Afghanistan, Iran and India. He is the son of the Social Democrats and Nobel Laureates Alva Myrdal and Gunnar Myrdal; he broke completely with both at an early age for personal reasons while keeping them in esteem for their public achievements. He was married to Gun Kessle, a photographer, graphic artist and writer, until her death in 2007. She illustrated many of his works.
In 1982 Myrdal went back to the Chinese village he reported on in 1962 and recorded his observations in Return to a Chinese Village (1984), in which he expressed his disappointment at the changes that had occurred, and his continued support of Mao's programs, including the Cultural Revolution.

Snatch is a 2000 British comedy-crime film written and directed by filmmaker Guy Ritchie, featuring an ensemble cast. Set in the London criminal underworld, the film contains two intertwined plots: one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) who finds himself under the thumb of a ruthless gangster known as Brick Top (Alan Ford).
The film features an assortment of colourful characters, including Irish Traveller Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), arms-dealer Boris "the Blade" Yurinov (Rade Šerbedžija), professional thief and gambling addict Franky "Four-Fingers" (Benicio del Toro), American gangster-jeweller "Cousin Avi" (Dennis Farina), and bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones). It is also distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, a circular plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace.
The film shares themes, ideas and motifs with Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It is also filmed in the same visual style and features many of the same actors, including Jones, Statham, and Ford.

Cry Freedom is a 1987 British drama film directed by Richard Attenborough, set in the late 1970s, during the apartheid era of South Africa. The screenplay was written by John Briley based on a pair of books by journalist Donald Woods. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist Steve Biko and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. Denzel Washington stars as Biko, while actor Kevin Kline portrays Woods. Cry Freedom delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.
The film was primarily shot on location in Zimbabwe due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. As a film showing mostly in limited cinematic release, it was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.
A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by Universal Pictures and Marble Arch Productions. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures theatrically, and by MCA Home Video for home media. Cry Freedom premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on 6 November 1987 grossing $5,899,797 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was at its widest release showing in 479 theaters nationwide. It was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas.

[[Beta-Alanine]]
CATEGORIES: Amino acids

β-Alanine (or ''beta''-alanine) is a naturally occurring beta amino acid, which is an amino acid in which the amino group is at the β-position from the carboxylate group (i.e., two atoms away, see Figure 1).  The IUPAC name for β-alanine is 3-aminopropanoic acid.  Unlike its counterpart α-alanine, β-alanine has no stereocenter.
β-Alanine is not used in the biosynthesis of any major proteins or enzymes. It is formed in vivo by the degradation of dihydrouracil and carnosine.  It is a component of the naturally occurring peptides carnosine and anserine and also of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), which itself is a component of coenzyme A. Under normal conditions, β-alanine is metabolized into acetic acid.
β-Alanine is the rate-limiting precursor of carnosine, which is to say carnosine levels are limited by the amount of available β-alanine, not histidine.http://pharmacistanswers.com/beta-alanine-supplementation-for-exercise-performance.html Supplementation with β-alanine has been shown to increase the concentration of carnosine in muscles, decrease fatigue in athletes and increase total muscular work done.[tpl]cite journal|author=Derave W, Ozdemir MS, Harris R, Pottier A, Reyngoudt H, Koppo K, Wise JA, Achten E. |title=Beta-alanine supplementation augments muscle carnosine content and attenuates fatigue during repeated isokinetic contraction bouts in trained sprinters |journal=J Appl Physiol |date=August 9, 2007 |pmid = 17690198 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00397.2007 |volume=103|issue=5 |pages=1736  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Hill CA, Harris RC, Kim HJ, Harris BD, Sale C, Boobis LH, Kim CK, Wise JA. |title=Influence of beta-alanine supplementation on skeletal muscle carnosine concentrations and high intensity cycling capacity |journal= Amino Acids |year=2007 |issue=2 |volume=32 |pages=225–33 |pmid =16868650 |doi=10.1007/s00726-006-0364-4 [/tpl] Simply supplementing with carnosine is not as effective as supplementing with  β-alanine alone since carnosine, when taken by mouth, is simply broken down during digestion to its components, histidine and beta-alanine. This results in only about 40% of the total dose being available as beta-alanine.
Typically, studies have used supplementing strategies of multiple doses of 400 mg or 800 mg, administered at regular intervals for up to eight hours, over periods ranging from 4 to 10 weeks.[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00726-006-0299-9 | last1 = Harris | first1 = RC | last2 = Tallon | first2 = MJ | last3 = Dunnett | first3 = M | last4 = Boobis | first4 = L | last5 = Coakley | first5 = J | last6 = Kim | first6 = HJ | last7 = Fallowfield | first7 = JL | last8 = Hill | first8 = CA | last9 = Sale | first9 = C et al. | last10 = Wise | first10 = J.

A study conducted at Adams State College, Alamosa, Colorado, compared the effects of β-alanine to a placebo group in two sports: wrestling and American football.  The subjects taking β-alanine achieved more desirable results on all tests compared to placebo, although none of the results were statistically significant.  The wrestlers, both placebo and supplement lost weight; the supplement group increased lean mass by 1.1 lb., while the placebo group lost lean mass (-0.98 lb). Both American football groups gained weight; the supplement group gained an average 2.1 lb lean mass compared to 1.1 lb for placebo.  Again, none of these results were statistically significant.[tpl]cite journal|author=Benjamin Kern, Tracey Robinson|title=Effects of beta-alanine supplementation on performance and body composition in collegiate wrestlers and American football players |journal=Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition |volume=6 |pages=P2 |date=July 31, 2009|doi=10.1186/1550-2783-6-S1-P2[/tpl]
L-Histidine, with a pKa of 6.1 is a relatively weak buffer over the physiological intramuscular pH range. However, when bound to other amino acids, this increases nearer to 6.8-7.0.

Furthermore, because of the position of the beta amino group, β-alanine dipeptides are not incorporated proteins and thus can be stored at relatively high concentrations (millimolar). Occurring at 17-25 mmol/kg (dry muscle),[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00376439 | last1 = Mannion | first1 = AF | last2 = Jakeman | first2 = PM | last3 = Dunnett | first3 = M | last4 = Harris | first4 = RC | last5 = Willan | first5 = PLT | year = 1992 | title = Carnosine and anserine concentrations in the quadriceps femoris muscle of healthy humans | url = | journal = Eur. J. Appl. Physiol | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 47–50 [/tpl] carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is an important intramuscular buffer, constituting 10-20% of the total buffering capacity in type I and II muscle fibres.
β-Alanine, provided in solution or as powder in gelatine capsules, however, causes paraesthesia when ingested in amounts above 10 mg per kg body weight (bwt). This is variable between individuals. Symptoms may be experienced by some individuals as mild even at 10 mg per kg bwt, in a majority as significant at 20 mg per kg bwt, and severe at 40 mg per kg bwt. However, an equivalent amount (equimolar) to 40 mg per kg bwt, ingested in the form of histidine containing dipeptides in chicken broth extract, did not cause paraesthesia.
It is probable that the paraesthesia, a form of neuropathic pain, results from high peak blood-plasma concentrations of β-alanine, since greater quantities, ingested in the form of the β-alanine/histidine (or methylhistidine)-containing dipeptides (i.e., carnosine and anserine) in meat, do not cause the same symptoms. In this case the β-alanine absorption profile is flattened but sustained for a longer period of time, whereas the β-alanine samples in the studies were administered as gelatine capsules containing powder. This resulted in the rapid rise of plasma concentrations, peaking within 30 to 45 minutes, and being eliminated after 90 to 120 minutes. The paraesthesia caused is no indication of efficacy, since the published studies undertaken so far have utilised doses of 400 mg or 800 mg at a time to avoid the paraesthesia. Furthermore, excretion of β-alanine in urine accounted for 0.60%(+/-0.09), 1.50%(+/-0.40), or 3.64%(+/-0.47) of the administered doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg per kg body weight, indicating greater losses occurring with increasing dosage.
Even though much weaker than glycine (and, thus, with a debated role as a physiological transmitter), β-alanine is an agonist next in activity to the cognate ligand glycine itself, for strychnine-sensitive inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) (the agonist order: glycine >> β-alanine > taurine >> alanine, L-serine > proline).Encyclopedia of Life Sciences Amino Acid Neurotransmitters.

[[Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951]]
CATEGORIES: Apartheid laws in South Africa, 1951 in law, 1951 in South Africa, Election legislation

The Separate Representation of Voters Act No. 46 was introduced in South Africa on 18 June 1951.  Part of the legislation during the apartheid era, the National Party introduced it to enforce racial segregation, and was part of a deliberate process to remove all non-white people from the voters' roll and revoke the Cape Qualified Franchise system.  
This act was declared invalid by the Supreme Court when challenged in the case of Harris v Minister of the Interior 1952(2) SA 428(AD); this gave rise to the Coloured vote constitutional crisis. The government, however, was able to circumvent the court's decision by increasing the number of Appellate Division judges from five to eleven, and increasing the size of the Senate from forty-eight to forty-nine.  These changes enabled the government to successfully introduce the South Africa Act Amendment Act No 9 of 2 March 1956, effectively overturning the Supreme Court's decision and revalidating the act.  This amendment was repealed by the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 32 of 1961. This case was one of many where South Africa's parliamentary sovereignty enabled the passing of laws without being subject to judicial review on substantive grounds. The judiciary was bound therefore leaving the legislature and executive to act independently from the third arm of government. Arguably this silencing of the judiciary allowed the Apartheid state to become further entrenched in the legal sphere of South Africa.
The act as a whole was repealed by section 4 of the Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act No 50 of 27 March 1968.  This bill introduced the Coloured Persons Representative Council, consisting of forty elected members and twenty nominated members.  This council could make laws on finance, local government, education, community welfare and pensions, rural settlements and agriculture which affected coloured people.  A bill could only be introduced when approved by the Minister of Coloured Relations, as well as requiring the approval of the white Cabinet.

[[400 metres hurdles]]
CATEGORIES: Events in athletics (track and field), Hurdling

The 400 metres hurdles is a track and field hurdling event. The event has been on the Olympic athletics programme since 1900 for men and since 1984 for women.
On a standard outdoor track, 400 metres is the length of the inside lane once around the stadium.  Runners stay in their lanes the entire way after starting out of the blocks and must clear ten hurdles that are evenly spaced around the track.  The hurdles are positioned and weighted so that they fall forward if bumped into with sufficient force, to prevent injury to the runners.  Although there is no longer any penalty for knocking hurdles over, runners prefer to clear them cleanly, as touching them during the race slows runners down.
The best male athletes can run the 400 m hurdles in a time of around 47 seconds, while the best female athletes achieve a time of around 53 seconds. The current men's and women's world record holders are Kevin Young with 46.78 seconds and Yuliya Pechonkina with 52.34 seconds. Compared to the 400 metres run, the hurdles race takes the men about three seconds longer and the women four seconds longer.
The 400 m hurdles was held for both sexes at the inaugural IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The first championship for women came at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics – being held as a one-off due to the lack of a race at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

CATEGORIES: Events in athletics (track and field), Sprint (running), 400 metres

The 400 metres, or 400 metre dash, is a common sprinting event in track and field competitions. It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 (1964 for women). On a standard outdoor running track, it is exactly one lap around the track. Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course. In many countries, athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash (402.336 m)—which is the length of a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile'—instead of the 400 m (437.445 yards), though this distance is now obsolete. An athlete who competes in the 400 m may still be referred to as 'quarter-miler'; the distance or event might still be called the "quarter."
Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event, but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap. While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event, there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400 metre athletes is open to debate.Canadian Journal of Applied Sport Sciences, "Aerobic versus anaerobic training for success in various athletic events" by Shepard, R. J., 1978 
The United States dominates the men's event. The current men's world record is held by American Michael Johnson, with a time of 43.18 seconds. The world indoor record holder is Kerron Clement, in 44.57 seconds. The current women's world record is held by Marita Koch, with a time of 47.60 seconds. Grenadan Kirani James is the reigning men's Olympic champion, while LaShawn Merritt holds the world title; Christine Ohuruogu is the reigning women's world champion, while Sanya Richards-Ross holds the women's Olympic title. The men's T43 (classification) Paralympic world record of 45.07 seconds is held by Oscar Pistorius.http://www.flightunit.com/uncategorized/who-oscar-pistorius-is/
An Olympic double of 200 metres and 400 m was first achieved by Valerie Brisco-Hooks in 1984, and later by Michael Johnson from the United States and Marie-José Pérec of France both in 1996. Alberto Juantorena of Cuba at the 1976 Summer Olympics became the first and so far the only athlete to win both the 400 m and 800 m Olympic titles.

The early history of Islam in the Netherlands can be traced to 16th century when Ottoman traders began settling in the nation's port cities. While religious exposure arrived via trade partnerships, improvised Mosques in Amsterdam were first constructed in the early 17th century.[tpl]nl[/tpl]Rather Turkish than Papist Historian Herman Pleij on Turkish-Dutch relations in 'dit is de dag', EO, Radio 1 In the ensuing timeframe, the Netherlands experienced sporadic Muslim immigration from the Dutch East Indies during its status as a colony of the Netherlands. Starting with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire through the independence of Indonesia, the greater Kingdom of the Netherlands contained the world's largest Muslim citizenry. However, the number of Muslims in the Kingdom's European territories were limited, accounting for less than 0.1% of the domestic population. 
The Netherlands' economic resurgence in the 1960 to 1973 timeframe motivated the Dutch government to recruit migrant labor, chiefly from Turkey and Morocco.

CATEGORIES: Electronica

Mana ERG is the musical project of ex recording engineer and multi-instrumentalist Bruno De Angelis. Born in Rome and grown up in London, he gained experience by recording and producing bands playing very different genres. This had a direct influence on his music, a genre-defying blend of industrial, ethereal, ebm, electronica, and rock elements.
Bruno's closest collaborators, who also assist him in the production, are Joe Erber (piano and keyboards) and Tiberio (guitars), but quite often they are joined by special guests such as soprano Deborah Roberts, who, with her crystal clear and yet warm vocals, adds an ethereal and dream-like touch to the sound. Other notable friends and collaborators are sound manipulator Antonym, Russian composer Artemiy Artemiev, Dieter Moebius, and Attrition's mastermind Martin Bowes.

Until it was truncated at Lilydale in 1980, the line continued to Healesville. The line between Yarra Glen and Healesville is now used by the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway. The track from Lilydale to Yarra Glen, including Coldstream and Yering is now disused. The Yarra Valley Tourist railway originally leased the entire line, however they discontinued their lease on the section from Lilydale to Yarra Glen, because of the bad condition of the bridges in that section. However, there are hopes to eventually restore the entire line.
Also branching off at Lilydale was the Warburton line. It opened in 1901, and closed on 1 August 1965. The track was removed in the early 1970s, as was the bridge over the Maroondah Highway. Most of the right-of-way is still intact, and has been turned into the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail. The exception to this is the part of the line approximately 800 metres beyond where it branched off at Lilydale. Mount Lilydale Mercy College currently leases this part of the line, which runs through its property. This is the only part of the line that is currently obstructed.

[[Kobayakawa Hideaki]]

CATEGORIES: 1577 births, 1602 deaths, Kobayakawa clan, Toyotomi clan, Daimyo

Kobayakawa Hideaki (小早川 秀秋, 1577 – December 1, 1602) was fifth son of Kinoshita Iesada and the nephew of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
He was adopted by Hideyoshi and called himself Hashiba Hidetoshi (羽柴 秀俊) and Shusen (秀栓). He was then again adopted by Kobayakawa Takakage and renamed himself Hideaki. Because he had gained the rank of Saemon no Kami (左衛門督) or in China Shikkingo (執金吾) at genpuku and held the title of Chunagon(中納言), Hideaki was also called Kingo Chunagon (金吾中納言).
During the Battle of Keicho he led reinforcements to rescue Ulsan Castle from the Ming army. Fighting on the front line with a spear, he managed to capture an enemy commander and successfully broke the siege. However, Hideyoshi saw the danger of a reckless charge by the general commanding an army and deprived him of his domain, Chikugo after returning. Kobayakawa, angered by this, believed the lie circulated by Tokugawa Ieyasu that this had been the doing of a jealous Ishida Mitsunari. He never forgot or forgave Mitsunari and worked to undermine his position. Moreover, Kobayakawa was known to attack women and children during the campaign, an act that is despised by many of his fellow commanders.
Before the battle of Sekigahara, Kobayakawa happened to be in Osaka and acted as though he would go along with Mitsunari, even though he had intended to betray him, having secretly communicated with Ieyasu. Knowing Kobayakawa held ill feelings, Mitsunari and Ōtani Yoshitsugu promised him two additional domains around Osaka and the position of kampaku (until Toyotomi Hideyori grew old enough to rule) if he helped them to victory.
Even after the battle began, Kobayakwa kept his intentions hidden. Ieyasu's force (east) was not faring well against Mitsunari from the west; Ukita Hideie was winning against Fukushima Masanori and Ōtani Yoshitsugu was also winning against Tōdō Takatora.  Kobayakawa was hesitant to participate with either side.  Ieyasu ordered troops to fire blanks against the Kobayakawa troops to force them into action. Kobayakawa then ordered an attack on the Otani troop and while this attack was beaten back temporarily, his action forced the other armies who had pledged betrayal to also turn.  The battle was over within a day.
Kobayakawa also had success in the mopping up operations that followed, defeating Mitsunari's father, Ishida Masatsugu in the siege of Sawayama.  Once the dust had settled, Kobayakawa was given the defeated Ukita clan's former fiefdoms of Bizen and Mimasaka, for a total of 550,000 koku.  However, Kobayakawa suddenly died two years later after supposedly going mad, and with no one to succeed him, the Kobayakawa clan disbanded, and his feifdoms were absorbed by the neighboring Ikeda clan.

[[Sha Wujing]]

CATEGORIES: Sha Seng, Chinese mythology, Journey to the West characters, Fictional Buddhist monks

Shā Wùjìng is one of the three disciples of Xuánzàng. He appears as a character in the novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en in the Ming Dynasty, although versions of his character predate the Ming novel.  In the novels, his background is the least developed of the pilgrims and he contributes the least to their efforts.

Tony Adams (born Anthony S. Adams, 11 December 1940) is a Welsh actor, best known for his performances in two British television soap operas.
Adams was born in Anglesey, Wales, and he trained as an actor at the Italia Conti Stage School.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sundaysun.co.uk/news/your-questions/2008/03/30/ask-tony-adams-79310-20692020/ | work=Sunday Sun | title=Ask: Tony Adams |author= | date=30 March 2008 | accessdate=26 March 2011[/tpl] After some stage appearances, including a starring role opposite Cheryl Kennedy in a West End revival of The Boy Friend, he made his name as Dr Neville Bywaters in the 1970s soap, General Hospital. He also appeared in the 1973 Doctor Who story The Green Death as Elgin.
In November 1978 he moved on to a major role in Crossroads, as mustachioed Adam Chance.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/birmingham/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8583000/8583024.stm | work=BBC Birmingham | title=Crossroads cast back to Birmingham |author= | date=23 March 2010 | accessdate=26 March 2011[/tpl] It is for this role that he is primarily remembered.

CATEGORIES: Plays by Euripides, Theseus, Plays adapted into films

Hippolytus ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἱππόλυτος[/tpl], Hippolytos) is an Ancient Greek tragedy by Euripides, based on the myth of Hippolytus, son of Theseus. The play was first produced for the City Dionysia of Athens in 428 BC and won first prize as part of a trilogy."Euripides' Hippolytus", translated by George Theodoridis
Euripides first treated the myth in Hippolytos Kalyptomenos ([tpl]Lang|grc|Ἱππόλυτος καλυπτόμενος[/tpl] – Hippolytus Veiled), now lost. Scholars are virtually unanimousSee, e.g., Barrett 1964; McDermott 2000. in believing that the contents to the missing Kalyptomenos portrayed a shamelessly lustful Phaedra who directly propositions Hippolytus,Hence the title: Hippolytus was so shocked by Phaedra's advances that he covers his face with a veil in horror. to the displeasure of the audience.This according to a hypothesis appended to the text of the Hippolytus that survives.
This failure prompted Euripides to revisit the myth in Hippolytos Stephanophoros ([tpl]Lang|grc|Ἱππόλυτος στεφανοφόρος[/tpl] – "Hippolytus who wears a crown"), in reference to the crown of garlands Hippolytus wears as a worshipper of Artemis, this time with a modest Phaedra who fights her sexual appetites. The surviving play offers a much more even-handed and psychologically complex treatment of the characters than is commonly found in traditional retelling of myths.

CATEGORIES: Car body styles, Automotive styling features

Targa top, targa for short, is a semi-convertible car body style with a removable roof section and a full width roll bar behind the seats. The term was first used on the 1966 Porsche 911 Targa,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/porsche/911/history.html |title=911 History |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2011-11-20[/tpl] and it remains a registered trademark of Porsche AG.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.porsche.com/international/legal-notice/ |title=Porsche official website |publisher=Porsche.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20[/tpl]
The rear window is normally fixed, but on some targa models, it is removable or foldable, making it a convertible-type vehicle. Any piece of metal or trim which rises up from the side of a car and continues in an uninterrupted line over the roof and down the other side is sometimes called a targa band, targa bar or a wrapover band.
Targa tops are different from T-tops, which have a solid, non-removable bar running between the top of the windscreen and the rear roll-bar, and generally have two separate roof panels above the seats that fit between the window and central t-bar.

The Shamrock Summit was the colloquial name given to the 1985 meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and US President Ronald Reagan in Quebec City. So-named because of the Irish background of the two leaders, and due to the meeting being held on St. Patrick's Day, the event is considered a major political-cultural episode in Canada, mostly on the basis of the perceived symbolism of the summit. It was also a prelude to Mulroney's efforts to create far closer links between Canada and the United States, culminating in the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.

The League of Democratic Socialists ([tpl]lang-de|Bund Demokratischer Sozialisten[/tpl]) is an Austrian political party formerly affiliated with the World Socialist Movement, though unlike most other WSM parties, it did not start as an offshoot of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.
BDS contested the 1959 legislative election, getting 2 190 votes (0.1%).http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/nrw_100559.asp
Though nominally favouring a classless, moneyless, egalitarian society, in recent years the Bund's newspaper has printed a number of nationalistic, anti-immigration articles.  As the opinions expressed in these articles could not be reconciled with the WSM's Declaration of Principles, the Bund was dropped as a WSM companion party circa 2003.

The Summa contra Gentiles by St Thomas Aquinas, also known as the Summa contra Gentes, has traditionally been dated to 1264, though more recent scholarship places it towards the end of Thomas’ life, 1270-73 (see Murphy).[tpl]Which|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] The work has occasioned much debate as to its purpose, its intended audience and its relationship to his other works. Thomas' work is divided into several categories: Scriptural commentaries, Aristotelian commentaries, Opuscula (smaller works), disputed questions and theological syntheses. The Summa contra Gentiles is usually classified as a theological synthesis[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] along with his earlier Commentary on the The Four Books of Sentences of Peter Lombard and his well-known Summa Theologica, although there are significant differences in scope and intent between all three of these works.
The Summa contra Gentiles is often portrayed as an early missionary's manual or handbook. Where the Summa Theologiæ was written to explain the Christian faith to theology students, the Summa contra Gentiles is more apologetic in tone, as it was written to explain and defend the Christian truth in hostile situations against unbelievers, with arguments adapted to fit the intended circumstances of its use, each article refuting a certain heretical belief or proposition. Instead of a mere elucidation of the length and breadth of Christian truth, Aquinas explains specific core articles of Christian belief.[tpl]cite book|last=Gilson|first=Etienne|title=The Christian Philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas|year=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=978-0-268-00801-7|pages=502[/tpl]
It was probably written to aid missionaries in explaining the Christian religion to and defending it against the Muslims and Jews, both of which, especially the former, had a strong Aristotelian philosophical tradition at the time.

[[Universe Symphony (Ives)]]

CATEGORIES: Unfinished symphonies, Symphonies by Charles Ives, Musical compositions completed by others, Music for orchestra and organ

The Universe Symphony is an unfinished work by American classical music composer Charles Ives.
The date of composition is unknown, but he probably worked on it periodically between 1911 and 1928.  Intended to be a "spatial" composition for two or more orchestras, it is in three sections:
He conceived the idea during the autumn of 1915 while he was staying in the Adirondacks of New York State.  He left it alone until 1923, when he returned to working on it.  Although he spent many years on it, many of the sketches are missing.  During the 1990s there were three separate performing versions assembled, including a version by David Gray Porter (1993, Section A plus the Coda and part of a first Prelude only), Larry Austin (1994), and Johnny Reinhard (1996).
It is a complex work, using 20 independent musical lines; each moves in a separate meter, only coinciding on downbeats eight seconds apart.  According to his notes on a sketch of the Universe Symphony, Ives was "striving to . paint the creation, the mysterious beginnings of all things known through God and man, to trace with tonal imprints the vastness, the evolution of all life, in nature, of humanity from the great roots of life to the spiritual eternities, from the great inknown to the great unknown." Ives envisioned the work being performed by multiple orchestras located in valleys, on hillsides and mountains, with the music mimicking "the eternal pulse . the planetary motion of the earth . the soaring lines of mountains and cliffs . deep ravines, sharp jagged edges of rock."
Pages are missing or were never written.
The first part (a.k.a. "Section A") was derived from a sketch of 1915 for a piece called "The Earth and the Heavens" or "The Earth and the Firmament," with one group of instruments representing the Earth and another group representing the Heavens, and with a group of percussion instruments reprenting the eternal pulse of the universe underlying both.  This is the most complete large fragment of the piece, along with a Coda for the complete movement written in a similar style that shares the same four main "Earth-themes" of Section A.  The main "sky-theme" is the only theme built upon a quotation, the hymn tune "Bethany" ("Nearer My God to Thee," the same hymn tune used as the basis for the Finale of his Fourth Symphony.)
There were also to be three Preludes to the Symphony, but none were completed.  The most complete is the first Prelude, but again this was not completed, left only in the form of an outline-sketch with musical examples.  For more information see James B. Sinclair's "Descriptive Catalogue" of Ives's music and manuscripts (1999). In addition, Reinhard has written a detailed history of Ives's composition of the Universe Symphony as well as his own process in preparing a performance edition from Ives's sketches (http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/Across-The-Universe/).

Dartford railway station serves the town of Dartford in Kent, England. All train services from the station are operated by Southeastern, which also manages the station. Dartford is a major interchange station in the North Kent region of the Southeastern network. Ticket barriers control access to the platforms.
The station is the nodal point for three lines from London:
Lines terminate west of Dartford at London Charing Cross and London Cannon Street via London Bridge, and London Victoria.
The first station was opened here by the South Eastern Railway it extended its North Kent Line from Gravesend on 30 July 1849, taking the line from there to London. The original station building had an Italianate design; this was replaced by a glass and metal ticket office complex in 1972. A footbridge leads across the line to the two island platforms, which are capable of a very large number of train movements during a working day. There are four carriage sidings at the country end of the station. Replacement of the 1972 station building was approved in 2011,http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/news/latest-news/dartford-station-upgrade-plans-revealed/ with enabling works started late that year, and major works commencing in mid-2012. The new building was opened in August 2013 with all works scheduled for completion by November of that year.http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/dartford-station-uk-investment-delivers-a-better-railway-for-passengers/

[[Subtext]]
CATEGORIES: Literary concepts, Fiction, Theme

Subtext or undertone is content of a book, play, musical work, film, video game, or television series which is not announced explicitly by the characters (or author) but is implicit or becomes something understood by the observer of the work as the production unfolds. Subtext can also refer to the thoughts and motives of the characters which are only covered in an aside. Subtext can also be used to imply controversial subjects without specifically alienating people from the fiction, often through use of metaphor.
Subtext is content underneath the spoken dialogue. Under dialogue, there can be conflict, anger, competition, pride, showing off, or other implicit ideas and emotions. Subtext is the unspoken thoughts and motives of characters—what they really think and believe.
Especially in light of their inherently ambiguous and self-referential character, many authors have explicitly used subtexts (or subtexts about subtexts) in humor.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Subtext is also a frequently used method of subtly inserting social or political commentary into fiction. Subtext is often also inserted in narratives where explicit themes are unable to be shown or expressed due to censorship or simply interest in appealing to a general audience. Frequently, these subtexts may be of, but not limited to, a sexual nature or possible references to sexual orientation. Their inclusion is such so that they are easily overlooked by younger viewers but may be caught by more mature viewers. Subtext also serves to add a complexity to a premise that may superficially appeal to younger viewers but may also attract older fans, as is often the case with cartoons, sci-fi and fantasy. It also may serve to aid in suspension of disbelief.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
A more recently coined term, metamessage (also spelled as meta-message and meta message) is considered by some authors to be synonymous with subtext.[tpl]cite book|author=Rachel Ballon|title=Breathing Life Into Your Characters|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z2sSIF2PMmEC&pg=PT240|year=2009|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=1-59963-342-6|page=225[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Angus Stevenson|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1112|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|page=1112[/tpl] Metamessage is a term more commonly used in the analysis of business communication rather than of literary works.[tpl]cite book|author1=Roger A.

Goodmayes railway station is a railway station at Goodmayes in the London Borough of Redbridge in east London, opened on 18 February 1901 by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on the Main Line from Liverpool Street. The station once had an extensive shunting yard for goods traffic but this fell into disuse during Dr. Beeching's modernisation (known at the time as "axing") of the railway system in 1963, and was eventually dismantled.  The site of the yard stood on the area between the present track and the High Road and has been replaced by a Tesco Extra superstore, other stores and housing. There was also a large yard area between the existing track area and Kinfauns Road. This yard area went as far as Chadwell Heath.
It is planned that Crossrail trains will call here, replacing current services. The station is in Travelcard Zone 4.

[[Chapel of ease]]

A chapel of ease (sometimes 'chapel-of-ease') is a church building other than the parish church, built within the bounds of a parish for the attendance of those who cannot reach the parish church conveniently.[tpl]cite web | last = Wooster | first = Lyman | title = Chapels of Ease | publisher = Heritage Library Foundation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA | url = http://www.heritagelib.org/articles/chapels-of-ease | accessdate = 8 February 2012[/tpl]
Often such a chapel of ease is deliberately built as such, being more accessible to some parishioners than the main church. Such a chapel may exist, for example, when a parish covers several dispersed villages, or a central village together with its satellite hamlet or hamlets. In such a case the parish church will be in the main settlement, with one or more chapels of ease in the subordinate village(s) and/or hamlet(s). An example is the chapel belonging to All Hallows' Parish in Maryland, USA; the chapel was built in Davidsonville from 1860 to 1865 because the parish's "Brick Church" in South River was too far away at [tpl]convert|5|mi|km[/tpl] distant.[tpl]cite web | last = Enright | first = Gail | title = The History of All Hallows Parish | url = http://www.allhallows.ang-md.org/history.shtml | accessdate = 8 February 2012 [/tpl] 
Some chapels of ease are buildings which used to be the main parish church until a larger building was constructed for that purpose. For example, the small village of Norton, Hertfordshire, contains the mediaeval church of St Nicholas, which served it adequately for centuries; but when the large new town of Letchworth was built, partly within the parish, St Nicholas's became too small to serve the increased population. This led to the building of a new main church building for the parish, and St Nicholas's became a chapel of ease.
Chapels of ease are sometimes associated with large manor houses, where they provide a convenient place of worship for the family of the manor, and for the domestic and rural staff of the house and the estate. There are many such chapels in England, for example that at Pedlinge in Kent. An example in the New World is Saint John's Chapel of Ease in Chamcook, New Brunswick, Canada, which was built in the 1840s to support a gentleman's house and the small settlement of shipbuilders, farmers, and grist-mill nearby.[tpl]Citation | last = Grimmer | first = E. Muriel | title = History of Saint John's Chapel of Ease, Chamcook, New Brunswick | publisher = CanadaGenWeb.org, an ancestry.com community | date = 1 August 2000 | url = http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nbstandr/churches/chapelease.htm | accessdate = 8 February 2012[/tpl]
Sometimes an ancient parish church is reduced in status to a chapel of ease due to a shift of population. An example is the churches of St Mary Wiston and All Saints at Buncton in West Sussex. For centuries St Mary's was the parish church (located near to Wiston House and therefore the centre of population), whilst All Saints served the nearby hamlet of Buncton, as a chapel of ease. Today, however, the resident population of Wiston is tiny, whilst Buncton has grown, so that in 2007 the status of the buildings was reversed, with All Saints becoming the parish church, and St Mary's reduced to a chapel of ease.
When two or more existing parishes are combined into a single parish, one or more of the old church buildings may be kept as a chapel of ease. An example can be seen in Palo Alto, California, where, in 1987, the six parishes of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose in California in the city were combined into a single parish, St. Thomas Aquinas Parish.[tpl]cite web | title = About St. Thomas Aquinas Parish | url = http://www.paloaltocatholic.net/index.cfm?load=page&page=199 | accessdate = 6 February 2012[/tpl] [tpl]As of|2007[/tpl], St. Thomas Aquinas Church serves as the parish church, with Our Lady of the Rosary Church and St. Albert the Great Church as chapels of ease.

[[Not proven]]
CATEGORIES: Scots language, Scottish criminal law, Scots law legal terms, High Court of Justiciary

Not proven is a verdict available to a court in Scotland.  As with other judicial systems, the burden to prove guilt rests with the prosecution.
Under Scots law, a criminal trial may end in one of three verdicts: one of conviction ("guilty") and two of acquittal ("not proven" and "not guilty").The Scottish criminal jury: A very peculiar institution, Peter Duff, 62 Law & Contemp. Probs. 173 (Spring 1999)
Historically, the two verdicts available to Scots juries were that the case had been "proven" or "not proven". However in a dramatic case in 1728 the jury asserted "its ancient right" to bring in a "not guilty" verdict even when the facts of the case were proven (see jury nullification). As the "not guilty" verdict gained wide acceptance amongst Scots juries, Scots began to use "not guilty" in cases where the jury felt the "not proven" verdict did not adequately express the innocence of the person on trial. Shrewd defence then further encouraged this interpretation in order to persuade juries unwilling to bring in a "not guilty" verdict that the "not proven" could be brought in as a lesser or "third verdict".
The result is the modern perception that the "not proven" verdict is an acquittal used when the judge or jury does not have enough evidence to convict but is not sufficiently convinced of the accused person's innocence to bring in a "not guilty" verdict. Essentially, the judge or jury is unconvinced that the suspect is innocent, but has insufficient evidence to the contrary.  In popular parlance, this verdict is sometimes jokingly referred to as "not guilty and don't do it again".Albert Borowitz: Blood & Ink, Kent State University Press, 2002, ISBN 0-87338-693-0, p 164
Out of the country, the "not proven" verdict may be referred to as the Scottish verdict, and in Scotland itself it may be referred to colloquially as the bastard verdict,Scotsman.com "Bastard Verdict" which was a term coined by Sir Walter Scott, who was sheriff in the court of Selkirk.
In Scottish criminal courts, the person on trial is referred to as the accused.  If the accused is convicted, he or she is thereafter referred to as the convicted.

[[Globalism]]

CATEGORIES: Buzzwords, Ideologies, International relations theory, Globalism, Globalization terminology, Postmodernism, Social theories, World government

The concept of globalism now is most commonly used to refer to different ideologies of globalization. The clearest rendition of this use is Manfred Steger's. He distinguishes different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism.Manfred B. Steger, The rise of the global imaginary: political ideologies from the French Revolution to the global war on terror, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008. Market globalisms include the ideology of neoliberalism.
Globalism emerged as a set of associated ideologies across the course of the late twentieth century. As these ideologies settled, and as various processes of globalization intensified, they contributed to the consolidation of a connecting global imaginary.Manfred B. Steger, The rise of the global imaginary: political ideologies from the French Revolution to the global war on terror, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008. In their recent writings Manfred Steger and Paul James have theorized this process in terms of four levels of change: changing ideas, ideologies, imaginaries and ontologies.Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism, Sage Publications, London, 2010. download pdf http://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames
In some hands, the reduction of globalism to market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World, Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their national interests in both positive and destructive ways.
American political scientist Joseph Nye, co-founder of the international relations theory of neoliberalism, generalized the term to argue that globalism refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by networks of connections that span multi-continental distances; while globalization refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism.Joseph Nye, "Globalism Versus Globalization" http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=2392 This more general use of the concept is much less influential.

Mimi Parent (September 8, 1924 – June 14, 2005), born Marie Parent in Montreal, was a Canadian surrealist artist. 
She was the eighth of the nine children of architect Lucien Parent. Between 1942 and 1947 she studied art at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal where she met the artist Jean Benoît (whom she later married in 1948). In 1947 she had her first one-woman exhibition at the Dominion Gallery in Montreal which received praise from Time Magazine.
In 1948 she received the Cézanne medal and exhibited at the "Surrealist intrusion into the Enchanter's Domain" in New York in 1960 and in 1966 had a solo exhibition at the "Maya" gallery in Brussels. She has also exhibited in Chicago, London, Lausanne and Frankfurt. She assisted with the organization of the "Exposition inteRnatiOnale du Surréalisme" (EROS) which ran from December 15, 1959 to February 15, 1960 in Paris, with the catalogue for the exhibition being designed by Parent and Duchamp. The exhibition catalogue, titled Boite Alerte – Missives Lascives, was presented as a green box into which ideas could be 'posted'.
She lived and worked in Paris, France. She died 14 June 2005 in Switzerland. Her ashes were scattered by her husband Jean Benoît at Château de Lacoste the estate of the Marquis de Sade in Haute-Provence.Jean Benoît s'éteint à Paris | René Viau, collaboration spéciale | Arts visuels.

CATEGORIES: Geography of Staten Island, Rivers of New York

Richmond Creek is a stream in Staten Island, a borough of New York City in the United States. Its upper drainage basin includes the remote forested hills in the center of the island. It empties into the Fresh Kills.
Its source is Orbach Lake, located on the grounds of the Pouch Camp, maintained by the Boy Scouts of America; from there it enters the Greenbelt, crossing underneath the intersection of Manor Road and Rockland Avenue, whereupon it enters the Egbertville Ravine, then emerges from the ravine and flows along the east side of Lighthouse Hill, skimming the western edge of the Richmondtown neighborhood (where bridges are necessary to cross it at several points, and creating dead-end streets at others) and through Historic Richmond Town. South of Richmondtown it emerges into a wide floodplain of wetlands that has been designated as part of Staten Island's "Bluebelt," a region of wetlands in which many, but not all, kinds of development are prohibited.
It flows under Richmond Avenue east of the Staten Island Mall and flows into the Fresh Kills alongside the former site of the Fresh Kills Landfill.
In colonial times and in the early 19th century the creek was used to operate several mills in the center of the island. One such mill is being restored along the creek in Historic Richmond Town.

[[Mixture distribution]]

CATEGORIES: Probability distributions, Systems of probability distributions

In probability and statistics, a mixture distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable whose values can be interpreted as being derived in the following way from an underlying set of other random variables: specifically, the realization of the random variable with a mixture distribution is randomly selected from among the realizations of the underlying random variables, with a certain probability of selection being associated with each. Here the underlying random variables may be random vectors (each having the same dimension) in which case the mixture distribution is a multivariate distribution.
In cases where each of the underlying random variables is continuous, the outcome variable will also be continuous and its probability density function is sometimes referred to as a mixture density. The cumulative distribution function (and the probability density function if it exists) can be expressed as a convex combination (i.e. a weighted sum, with non-negative weights that sum to 1) of other distribution functions and density functions. The individual distributions that are combined to form the mixture distribution are called the mixture components, and the probabilities (or weights) associated with each component are called the mixture weights.  The number of components in mixture distribution is often restricted to being finite, although in some cases the components may be countably infinite. More general cases (i.e. an uncountable set of component distributions), as well as the countable case, are treated under the title of compound distributions.
A distinction needs to be made between a random variable whose distribution function or density is the sum of a set of components  (i.e. a mixture distribution) and a random variable whose value is the sum of the values of two or more underlying random variables, in which case the distribution is given by the convolution operator.  As an example, the sum of two jointly normally distributed random variables, each with different means, will still have a normal distribution.  On the other hand, a mixture density created as a mixture of two normal distributions with different means will have two peaks provided that the two means are far enough apart, showing that this distribution is radically different from a normal distribution. 
Mixture distributions arise in many contexts in the literature and arise naturally where a statistical population contains two or more subpopulations. They are also sometimes used as a means of representing non-normal distributions. Data analysis concerning statistical models involving mixture distributions is discussed under the title of mixture models, while the present article concentrates on simple probabilistic and statistical properties of mixture distributions and how these relate to properties of the underlying distributions.

The Chetco River is a [tpl]convert|56|mi|km|adj=mid|-long|sigfig=2[/tpl] stream located in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Oregon. It drains approximately [tpl]convert|352|mi2|km2|sigfig=3[/tpl] of Curry County. Flowing through a rugged and isolated coastal region, it descends rapidly from about [tpl]convert|3200|ft|m|sigfig=3[/tpl] to sea level at the Pacific Ocean. Except for the lowermost [tpl]convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1[/tpl], the river is located entirely within the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest. The river rises in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, northwest of Chetco Peak at the junction of the Oregon Coast Range and the Klamath Mountains. It flows generally north, west, and then southwest, before emptying into the ocean between Brookings and Harbor, approximately [tpl]convert|6|mi|km|sigfig=1[/tpl] north of the California state line. The Chetco River's watershed remains largely undeveloped, protected by the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. The upper [tpl]convert|45|mi|km|sigfig=2[/tpl] of the river have been designated Wild and Scenic since 1988.
Native Americans have lived in the Chetco River's watershed for the last one to three thousand years. Several explorers, including Sir Francis Drake, George Vancouver, and Jedediah Smith, visited the region between the 16th and 19th centuries, and found the Chetco people inhabiting the area. Non-indigenous settlers arrived soon after gold and other precious metals were discovered in the 1840s and 1850s. The town of Brookings was founded in the early 20th century, and incorporated in 1951. Fourteen thousand residents of Brookings and Harbor rely on the Chetco for drinking water.
Supporting a large population of salmon and trout, the Chetco's water is of very high quality. The watershed is home to many other species, including several that are endemic to the Siskiyou Mountains area. The northernmost grove of Redwoods—the tallest trees on Earth—grow in the southern region of the Chetco's drainage basin. In total, the river is home to over 200 species of animals, and 97 percent of the watershed is forested.

[[Macarius Magnes]]

CATEGORIES: Christian religious leaders, Theologians, 4th-century Christians

Macarius Magnes is the author of an apology against a Neo-Platonic philosopher of the early part of the fourth century, contained in a manuscript of the fifteenth century discovered at Athens in 1867 and edited by C. Blondel (Paris, 1876). This work agrees in its dogmatics with Gregory of Nyssa, and is valuable on account of the numerous excerpts from the writings of the opponent of Macarius. These fragments are apparently drawn from the lost "Words against the Christians" of Porphyry or from the "Truth-Loving Words" of Hierocles. 
He may be the Macarius, bishop of Magnesia, who, at the Synod of the Oak in 403, brought charges against Heraclides, bishop of Ephesus, the friend of John Chrysostom, although Adolf Harnack dated him in the late third century.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Macarius Magnes[/tpl]

Saint Macarius of Jerusalem was Bishop of Jerusalem from 312 to shortly before 335, according to Sozomen. 
St. Athanasius, in one of his orations against Arianism, refers to St. Macarius as an example of "the honest and simple style of apostolical men."  The date 312 for Macarius's accession to the episcopate is found in St. Jerome's version of Eusebius of Caesarea's Chronicles; Tillement . 
About 325 he accompanied Saint Helena, the mother of Constantine I in her successful search at Jerusalem for the True Cross. 
His death must have been before the Council of Tyre, in 335, at which his successor, Maximus, was apparently one of the bishops present.
He also received a long letter from Constantine the Great with reference to the building of the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem: "Such is our Saviour's grace, that no power of language seems adequate to describe the wondrous circumstance to which I am about to refer. For, that the monument of his most holy Passion, so long ago buried beneath the ground, should have remained unknown for so long a series of years, until its reappearance to his servants now set free through the removal of him who was the common enemy of all, is a fact which truly surpasses all admiration ... And as to the columns and marbles, whatever you shall judge, after actual inspection of the plan, to be especially precious and serviceable, be diligent to send information to us in writing, in order that whatever quantity or sort of materials we shall esteem from your letter to be needful, may be procured from every quarter, as required, for it is fitting that the most marvelous place in the world should be worthily decorated."Eusebius, Vita Constantini, III, 30-32.

[[Desk on a frame]]

CATEGORIES: Desks

The desk on a frame (or desk on frame) is usually an antique form made up of two pieces of furniture. The first piece is a fairly large and closable portable desk with  a slanted hinged top giving access to the writing surface and utility nooks and small drawers. The second piece is a stand made for it in the same style and material. It is also sometimes a single piece of furniture which looks as if it were made up of the two previous pieces but is in fact solid and nondetachable. This form was popular in Colonial America and was often done in the Queen Anne style.
The slant top desk is a direct morphological descendant. In a sense the  Spanish Bargueño (or Vargueño) desk is a distant cousin of the two piece version, since the Bargueño is also made up of a portable desk and a stand constructed specially for it, using the same materials and style.

[[School of Fontainebleau]]

CATEGORIES: French art, French Renaissance, French art movements, Mannerism

The Ecole de Fontainebleau (c.1530–c.1610) refers to two periods of artistic production in France during the late Renaissance centered around the royal Château de Fontainebleau, that were crucial in forming the French version of Northern Mannerism.
Oxford Dictionary of Art
First School of Fontainebleau (from 1531)
Second School of Fontainebleau (from 1594)
In 1531, the Florentine artist Rosso Fiorentino, having lost most of his possessions at the Sack of Rome in 1527, was invited by François I to come to France, where he began an extensive decorative program for the Château de Fontainebleau.  In 1532 he was joined by another Italian artist, Francesco Primaticcio (from Bologna).  Rosso died in France in 1540.  On the advice of Primaticcio, Niccolò dell'Abbate (from Modena) was invited to France in 1552 by François's son Henri II.  Although known for their work at Fontainebleau, these artists were also invited to create works of art for other noble families of the period and were much esteemed and well-paid.
The works of this "first school of Fontainebleau"  are characterized by the extensive use of stucco (moldings and picture frames) and frescos, and an elaborate (and often mysterious) system of allegories and mythological iconography.  Renaissance decorative motifs such as grotesques, strapwork and putti are common, as well as a certain degree of eroticism.  The figures are elegant and show the influence of the techniques of the Italian Mannerism  of Michelangelo, Raphael and especially Parmigianino.  Primaticcio was also directed to make copies of antique Roman statues for the king, thus spreading the influence of classical statuary.  Many of the works of Rosso, Primaticcio and dell'Abate have not survived; parts of the Chateau were remodelled at various dates.  The paintings of the group were reproduced in prints, mostly etchings, which were apparently produced initially at Fontainebleau itself, and later in Paris.  These disseminated the style through France and beyond, and also record several paintings that have not survived.  
The mannerist style of the Fontainebleau school influenced French artists (with whom the Italians worked) such as the painter Jean Cousin the Elder, the sculptors Jean Goujon and Germain Pilon, and, to a lesser degree, the painter and portraitist François Clouet the son of Jean Clouet.
From 1584 to 1594, during the Wars of Religion the château of Fontainebleau was abandoned.  Upon his ascension to the throne, Henri IV undertook a renovation of the Fontainebleau buildings using a group of artists: the Flemish born Ambroise Dubois (from Antwerp)  and the Parisians Toussaint Dubreuil and Martin Fréminet.  They are sometimes referred to as the "second school of Fontainebleau".  Their late mannerist works, many of which have been lost, continue in the use of elongated and undulating forms and crowded compositions.  Many of their subjects include mythological scenes and scenes from works of fiction by the Italian Torquato Tasso and the ancient Greek novelist Heliodorus of Emesa.
Their style would continue to have an influence on artists through the first decades of the 17th century, but other artistic currents (Peter Paul Rubens, Caravaggio, the Dutch and Flemish naturalist schools) would soon eclipse them.

In mathematics, Pascal's pyramid is a three-dimensional arrangement of the trinomial numbers, which are the coefficients of the trinomial expansion and the trinomial distribution. Pascal's Pyramid is the three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional Pascal's triangle, which contains the binomial numbers and relates to the binomial expansion and the binomial distribution. The binomial and trinomial numbers, coefficients, expansions, and distributions are subsets of the multinomial constructs with the same names. Pascal's Pyramid is more precisely called "Pascal's tetrahedron", since it has four triangular surfaces. (The pyramids of ancient Egypt had five surfaces: a square base and four triangular sides.)

Birdstone (foaled May 16, 2001, in Kentucky) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 2004 Belmont Stakes and has become a successful sire.
Owned and bred by Marylou Whitney of Whitney family racing fame, Birdstone won the Champagne Stakes, a leading race for two-year-olds, at Belmont Park in 2003, but was not a factor in the first two Triple Crown races (finishing eighth in the Kentucky Derby and skipping the Preakness Stakes) and was a 36-1 longshot when he upset the overwhelmingly favored Smarty Jones, taking the lead in the final furlong (201 m) in the fastest Belmont since the advent of modern electronic timing (2002 was the first year times were kept to hundredths).
His sire Grindstone won the Kentucky Derby in 1996 and was a son of 1990 Derby winner Unbridled. Unbridled was in turn sired by Fappiano, a son of Mr. Prospector, the tail-male ancestor of the vast majority of winners of Triple Crown races in recent years (22 out of the 24 races 1998-2005).
Birdstone's victory represented the first in the Belmont for trainer Nick Zito, whose horses had finished second in that classic five times. In the winner's circle after the Belmont Stakes, his owners apologized to the connections of Smarty Jones for winning, as did jockey Edgar Prado.
According to the New York Times, the next major target for Birdstone was the Travers Stakes, which he won despite being the fourth choice at 5-1.  He was Zito's first Travers champion.
Birdstone's retirement from racing after suffering a bone chip at the Breeders' Cup was announced on November 4, 2004. He is standing at stud at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.
His first starter was the colt Shoe Strap (Birdstone - Boot Strap by Storm Boot), who first went to post on May 21, 2008, at Churchill Downs and is trained by D. Wayne Lukas.Who U Like? Shoe Strap? - Maiden Watch  Birdstone also sired Mine That Bird, who had several wins as a two-year-old gelding before winning the 2009 Kentucky Derby as a three-year-old. Another of Birdstone's top runners was Summer Bird, who upset Mine That Bird in the 2009 Belmont Stakes. His first crop also included Birdrun, who set the Belmont track record at a mile and a sixteenth http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/53074/track-mark-broken-at-belmont-another-equaled and repeated his sire's feat by winning the Travers as well.  Summer Bird later won the 2009 Jockey Club Gold Cup.
Birdstone was one of the top ten ranked freshman sires of 2008 with 11 winners out of 22 starters and stood for $10,000 for the remainder of the 2009 season, despite his first-crop success.  His 2010 stud fee was posted as $30,000. http://www.gainesway.com/horses/birdstone-196.html

The river is the largest tributary of Coos Bay, which at about [tpl]convert|10000|acre|ha[/tpl] is the largest estuary that lies entirely within Oregon. The river enters the bay about [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] from where the bay—curving east, north, and west of the cities of Coos Bay and North Bend and passing by the communities of Barview and Charleston—meets the ocean. About 30 other tributaries also enter the bay directly. 
Most of the Coos River watershed of [tpl]convert|730|mi2|km2[/tpl] is in Coos County, but [tpl]convert|147|mi2|km2[/tpl] are in eastern Douglas County. Commercial forests cover about 85 percent of the basin. 
The river supports populations of chinook and coho salmon, shad, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Since public river-bank access is limited, fishing is often done by boat. Sheehan, pp. 66–67

Coos Bay is an S-shaped inlet where the Coos River enters the Pacific Ocean, approximately 10 miles (16 km) long and two miles (three km) wide, on the Pacific Ocean coast of southwestern Oregon in the United States. The city of Coos Bay, once named Marshfield, was renamed for the bay and is located on its inner side. The Port of Coos Bay is the largest and deepest port between San Francisco, California and the Columbia River.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
Coos Bay is located in northern Coos County. Other communities on the bay include North Bend and Charleston. Many of the fishing and pleasure boats that call Coos Bay home are docked in Charleston.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] 
Coos Bay is the proposed site of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal by Jordan Cove Energy Project.

[[Marc-Antoine Parseval]]
CATEGORIES: 1755 births, 1836 deaths, 18th-century French mathematicians, 19th-century French mathematicians

Marc-Antoine Parseval des Chênes (April 27, 1755 – August 16, 1836) was a French mathematician, most famous for what is now known as Parseval's theorem, which presaged the unitarity of the Fourier transform.
He was born in Rosières-aux-Salines, in France, into an aristocratic French family, and married Ursule Guerillot in 1795, but divorced her soon thereafter.  A monarchist opposed to the French revolution, imprisoned in 1792, Parseval later fled the country for publishing poetry critical of the government of Napoleon.
Later, he was nominated to the French Academy of Sciences five times, from 1796 to 1828, but was never elected. His only mathematical publications were, apparently, five papers, published in 1806 as Mémoires présentés à l'Institut des Sciences, Lettres et Arts, par divers savants, et lus dans ses assemblées. Sciences mathématiques et physiques. (Savants étrangers.)  This combined the following earlier monographs:
It was in the second, 1799, memoir in which he stated, but did not prove (claiming it to be self-evident), the theorem that now bears his name.  He further expanded upon it in his 1801 memoir, and used it to solve various differential equations. The theorem was first printed in 1800 as a part (p. 377) of Traité des différences et des séries by Lacroix.

[[Defenders (comics)]]

CATEGORIES: Marvel Comics titles, Comics characters introduced in 1971, 1972 comic debuts, Marvel Comics superhero teams

The Defenders is the name of a number of Marvel Comics superhero groups which are usually presented as a "non-team" of individualistic "outsiders," each known for following their own agendas. The team often battled mystic and supernatural threats.
Its original incarnation was led by Doctor Strange and included the Hulk, Namor, and, eventually, the Silver Surfer. They first appeared as The Defenders in Marvel Feature #1 (December 1971).
The group had a rotating line-up from 1972 until 1986, with Dr. Strange and the Hulk being more or less constant members along with a number of other mainstays such as Valkyrie, Nighthawk, Hellcat, the Gargoyle, Beast, the Son of Satan and Luke Cage, and a large number of temporary members. The publication was retitled near the end of the run as The New Defenders but featured none of the original members and only Valkyrie, the Beast and the Gargoyle of the former long-term members. The concept was modified in the 1993–95 series Secret Defenders, in which Dr. Strange assembled different teams for each individual mission. Later, the original team were reunited in a short-lived series by Kurt Busiek and Erik Larsen. In the 2000s, Marvel published a new miniseries featuring the classic line-up. Writer Matt Fraction and artist Terry Dodson launched a new Defenders series in December 2011.

The valley of the river has been historically one of the productive timber regions in Oregon. The lower course of the river passes through Siuslaw National Forest.
The Coos Bay branch of the Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad crosses many bridges as it follows the narrow, winding valley of the Siuslaw River to the swing bridge at Cushman.
The river has historically been a spawning ground for Chinook and Coho salmon. Although the Chinook population is substantial, Coho numbers have declined from an annual average of 209,000 fish between 1889 and 1896 to just over 3,000 fish between 1990 and 1995.

A policy of deliberate ambiguity (also known as a policy of strategic ambiguity) is the practice by a country of being intentionally ambiguous on certain aspects of its foreign policy or whether it possesses certain weapons of mass destruction. It may be useful if the country has contrary foreign and domestic policy goals or if it wants to take advantage of risk aversion to abet a deterrence strategy.  Such a policy can be very risky as it may cause misinterpretation of a nation's intentions, leading to actions that contradict that nation's wishes.

Erki Nool (born 25 June 1970 in Võru, Estonia) is an Estonian decathlete and politician. 
Nool is a winner of the gold medal for decathlon in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Although Nool did not place first in any individual event, his total score was the highest. Nool won the title after the competition referee decided to over-rule a discus judge, who had red-flagged his last and only valid attempt due to alleged step-out. The reinstatement of his 43.66-metre third throw sparked unsuccessful counter-protests from other teams. Nool took gold ahead of the Czech Roman Šebrle and American Chris Huffins.
On September 1997 he established the first private athletics school in Estonia.About Erki Nool on Decathlon2000.ee

[[Fraser alphabet]]

CATEGORIES: Alphabets, Loloish languages, Languages of China, Languages of India, Languages of Burma, Languages of Thailand

The Fraser alphabet or Old Lisu Alphabet is an artificial script invented around 1915 by Sara Ba Thaw, a Karen preacher from Myanmar, and improved by the missionary James O. Fraser, to write the Lisu language. It is a single-case (unicameral) alphabet.
The alphabet uses uppercase letters from the Latin script, and rotated versions thereof, to write consonants and vowels. Tones and nasalization are written with Roman punctuation marks, identical to those found on a typewriter. Like the Indic abugidas, the vowel [tpl]IPA|a[/tpl] is not written. However, unlike those scripts, the other vowels are written with full letters.
The Chinese government recognized the alphabet in 1992 as the official script for writing in Lisu.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]

[[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1938]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1938 in baseball

The 1938 elections to select inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame were conducted along much the same lines as the 1937 vote. Toward the goal of 10 initial inductees from the 20th century, 8 had now been selected; members of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) were once again given authority to select any players active in the 20th century, excepting active players. The Centennial Commission retained the responsibility of selecting inductees whose contributions were largely as non-players.
In the BBWAA election, voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates. Any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall upon its opening in the sport's supposed centennial year of 1939. Individuals who had been barred from baseball, though not formally ineligible, no longer received even the minimal support given them in the two prior elections.
As the obvious stars had already been elected, only pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander made it out of this ballot.

Joseph Fred Hueglin (born February 7, 1937) is a former Canadian Member of Parliament and a founder of the Progressive Canadian Party.
Born in Stratford, Ontario, Hueglin was elected to Parliament in 1972 in the riding of Niagara Falls as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC). In 1974 Hueglin was defeated by the Liberal candidate.
Along with David Orchard, Hueglin has been among the most vocal opponents of the 2003 merger of Canada's two prominent right-wing parties, the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance, into the Conservative Party of Canada.  He has expressed discomfort over the way the merger took place - which involved PC leader Peter MacKay breaking an anti-merger promise he made while campaigning to be the party leader - and the "neoconservative" aspects of Alliance policy, which he feared may dominate the new party's policies.
In 2004, Hueglin became a lead organizer for the Progressive Canadian Party, which he has described as a centrist party.

The Salmon River flows from the Central Oregon Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. About [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] long, it begins and ends in Lincoln County but also flows briefly through western Polk and southern Tillamook counties.[tpl]cite map  |publisher = DeLorme Mapping  |title = Oregon Atlas and Gazetteer  |edition = 2008  |section =52, 58 |isbn = 978-0-89933-347-2[/tpl]
Rising in the mountains near the Lincoln–Polk county line, it flows east into Polk County, then north and west, re-entering Lincoln County, entering Tillamook County and re-entering Lincoln County near Oregon Route 18. It continues generally west-southwestward through the Siuslaw National Forest, turning west again to enter the Pacific near Cascade Head, about [tpl]convert|4|mi|km|0[/tpl] north of Lincoln City.

[[Augustalis]]

CATEGORIES: Gold coins, Medieval currencies, Medieval Latin inscriptions, Kingdom of Sicily, Currencies of Italy

An augustalis or augustale was a gold coin minted in the Kingdom of Sicily beginning around 1231. It was the first gold issue of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily (1197–1250), and was minted until his death. It bore a Latin inscription and was widely circulated in Italy. It was patterned after the Roman aureus and its halves. It was minted at Brindisi and Messina with accompanying billon deniers. The style of the coinage has been described as splendid and proto-Renaissance; the quality of its execution and its fineness is high. The coin weighed about 5.24 grams, which is ¼ of a Sicilian gold ounce.
The obverse contains an classical (not medieval) bust of the emperor wearing a laureate wreath with the legend CESAR AVG IMP ROM (Caesar Augustus, Emperor of the Romans); the reverse shows an eagle, the imperial symbol, with the name FRIDE RICVS (Frederick). The name augustalis means literally "of the august one", referring to the coin's provenance from the emperor himself, but also linking it with the Roman Emperor, who was commonly styled Augustus.

[[Nezikin]]

CATEGORIES: Jewish courts and civil law

For Jewish law on damages, see Damages (Jewish law)
Nezikin (Hebrew: נזיקין, Damages Neziqin) or Seder Nezikin (סדר נזיקין, The Order of Damages) is the fourth Order of the Mishna (also the Tosefta and Talmud). It deals largely with Jewish criminal and civil law and the Jewish court system.
Nezikin contains ten volumes (or "tractates"):
Originally, the first three volumes were counted as one single, very lengthy volume. Since it was the chief repository of "civil" law, it was simply called Massekhet Nezikin ("Tractate Damages"). The traditional reasoning for the order of the volumes of Nezikin is as follows: The Order begins with civil law (the first 3 tractates) because it is considered the cornerstone of righteousness within a Jewish state. Sanhedrin naturally follows, as it deals with criminal law. Next comes Makkot, as it is a continuation of Sanhedrin's subject matter in terms of criminal procedure. Then, Shevuot, which continues the general topic dealt with in Makkot of the false testimony. After outlining the main points of civil and criminal law, Eduyot follows to fit it all into a halakhic framework. After dealing with "damages" within a society, the next stage is Avodah Zarah placed after to highlight what is seen as behaviour that inflicts damage on the universe. Avot is probably placed next to counteract the negativity of the laws of Avodah Zarah and to relate maxims of the Sages, an essential aspect of whose teaching was to counteract idolatry. Finally, Horayot brings the discussion from lofty heights to a humble note, highlighting the concept that even the Sages and battei din can err.
There is both a Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud to each of the tractates except for Eduyot and Avot. This is probably because these two tractates aren't concerned with individual laws and therefore don't lend themselves to a Gemara style analysis.

Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF, [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|f[/tpl]), or Willing Workers on Organic Farms, is a loose network of national organisations that facilitate placement of volunteers on organic farms. While there are WWOOF hosts in 99 countries around the world, no central list or organisation encompasses all WWOOF hosts. As there is no single international WWOOF membership, all recognised WWOOF country organisations strive to maintain similar standards,  and work together to promote the aims of WWOOF.WWOOF - Around the World
WWOOFing aims to provide volunteers with first-hand experience in organic and ecologically sound growing methods, to help the organic movement, and to let volunteers experience life in a rural setting or a different country. WWOOF volunteers ('WWOOFers') generally do not receive financial payment. The host provides food, accommodation, and opportunities to learn, in exchange for assistance with farming or gardening activities.
The duration of the visit can range from a few days to years. Workdays average five to six hours, and participants interact with WWOOFers from other countries.Simmons, Krista, Work a little, get back a lot, May 27, 2009, page 8, Brand X (Los Angeles Times) WWOOF farms include private gardens through smallholdings, allotments, and commercial farms. Farms become WWOOF hosts by enlisting with their national organisation.   In countries with no WWOOF organisation, farms enlist with WWOOF Independents:WWOOF IndependentsWWOOF Independents AfricaWWOOF Independents Asia-PacificWWOOF Independents EuropeWWOOF Independents Latin America
Examples of WWOOF experiences include harvesting cup gum honey from Ligurian bees at Island Beehive in Kangaroo Island, harvesting Syrah grapes for Knappstein Vineyard in the Clare Valley, and harvesting coffee beans from arabicas in Northern Thailand.

Although a passing loop had been present at the station for many years (believed to have been originally used as a goods siding), the second platform was only built in the 1990s, allowing more efficient passing of trains. Before the second platform was constructed, one train had to set back after using the platform, then enter the loop to allow another train to pass.
Originally both platforms were bi-directional, however with the introduction of electronic signalling in 2008, Platform 2 can only be used by northbound trains.

[[Foil bearing]]

CATEGORIES: Bearings, Gas turbine technology

Foil bearings, also known as foil-air bearings, are a type of air bearing. A shaft is supported by a compliant, spring-loaded foil journal lining. Once the shaft is spinning quickly enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that there is no more contact. The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure which is generated by the rotation which pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects. A high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs. Unlike aero or hydrostatic bearings, foil bearings require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid, so the hydrodynamic bearing is self-starting.

[[Hod (Kabbalah)]]
CATEGORIES: Sephirot, Hebrew words and phrases, Kabbalistic words and phrases

Hod ("Majesty"; הוד) in the Kabbalah of Judaism is the eighth sephira of the Kabbalistic tree of life. It is derived from hod הוד in the Hebrew language meaning "majesty" or "splendor" and denoting "praise" as well as "submission". 
Hod sits below Gevurah and across from Netzach in the tree of life; Yesod is to the south-east of Hod. It has four paths, which lead to Gevurah, Tiphereth, Netzach, and Yesod.
All the sephirot are likened to different parts of the body, and netzach and hod are likened to the two feet of a person: right foot and left foot. Feet are usually only the means for a person's activity. While the hands are the main instrument of action, the feet bring a person to the place where he wishes to execute that action.
Hasidic Judaism's view of Hod is that it is connected with Jewish prayer. Prayer is seen as form of "submission"; Hod is explained as an analogy - that instead of "conquering" an obstacle in one's way, (which is the idea of Netzach), subduing oneself to that "obstacle" is related to the quality of Hod.
In a mystical sense, in which the Tree of Life is supposed to be a roadmap to "consciousness", Hod is where form is given by language in its widest sense, being the key to the mystery of form. (Perhaps this may be an adopting of a point of view of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan), our unconscious desires come from Netzach, and are given form in the symbolic realm by Hod, manifesting unconsciously through Yesod to Malkuth.

Luis Enrique Ugueto oo-ge-to (born February 15, 1979 in Caracas, Venezuela) is a Major League Baseball second baseman and switch-hitter who is currently a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball for the Seattle Mariners.
Originally signed by the Florida Marlins as an amateur free agent in 1996, he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates from Florida in the 2001 Rule 5 draft, and was traded to the Mariners for cash the same day. Finally, he made his debut with the Mariners on April 3, 2002.

Ugueto signed with the Kansas City Royals prior to the 2005 season and spent the season with the Royals' top minor league club, the Omaha Royals. While with Omaha, he was suspended twice for violating baseball's steroid policy, and he was released by the Royals after the second violation.

[[Iranian rial]]
CATEGORIES: Currencies of Iran, 1798 introductions, 1932 introductions

The rial (in Persian: ریال; ISO 4217 code IRR) is the currency of Iran and, as of 2014, remains the world's least valued currency unit.http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cur_lea_val_cur_uni_exc_rat_to_1_us_dol-exchange-rate-1-us-dollar
The name derives from the Spanish real, which was for several centuries, the currency in Spain (derived from Latin regalis regal).
Although the "toman" is no longer an official unit of Iranian currency, Iranians commonly express amounts of money and prices of goods in "tomans."  For this purpose, one "toman" equals 10 rials.  Despite this usage, amounts of money and prices of goods are virtually always written in rials.  For example, the sign next to a loaf of bread in a store would state the price in rials, e.g., "10,000 Rials," even though the clerk, if asked, would say that the bread costs "1,000 tomans."
There is no official symbol for the currency but the Iranian standard ISIRI 820 defined a symbol for use on typewriters (mentioning that it is an invention of the standards committee itself) and the two Iranian standards ISIRI 2900 and ISIRI 3342 define a character code to be used for it. The Unicode Standard has a compatibility character defined [tpl]unichar|FDFC|RIAL SIGN|html=[/tpl].For the proposal, see [tpl]cite web|last=Pournader|first=Roozbeh|date=2001-09-20|title=Proposal to add Arabic Currency Sign Rial to the UCS|url=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2373.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] It proposes the character under the name of ARABIC CURRENCY SIGN RIAL, which was changed by the standard committees to RIAL SIGN.

Ricotta ([tpl]IPA-it|riˈkotta[/tpl]) is an Italian whey cheese made from sheep (or cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo) milk whey left over from the production of cheese.
Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the keratin proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin. Thus, ricotta can be eaten by persons with casein intolerance.
Ricotta (literally meaning "recooked") uses whey, the liquid that remains after straining curds when making cheese. Most of the milk protein (especially casein) is removed when cheese is made, but some protein remains in the whey, mostly albumin.  This remaining protein can be harvested if the whey is first allowed to become more acidic by additional fermentation (by letting it sit for 12–24 hours at room temperature).  Then the acidified whey is heated to near boiling.  The combination of low pH and high temperature denatures the protein and causes it to precipitate out, forming a fine curd.  Once cooled, the curd is separated by passing through a fine cloth.
Ricotta curds are creamy white in appearance, slightly sweet in taste, and contain around 13% fat. In this form, it is somewhat similar in texture to some cottage cheese variants, though considerably lighter. It is highly perishable. However, ricotta also comes in aged varieties which are preservable for much longer.

[[Pearl and Hermes Atoll]]

CATEGORIES: Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Atolls of Hawaii, Coral reefs of the United States, Reefs of the Pacific Ocean

The Pearl and Hermes Atoll (Hawaiian: Holoikauaua), is part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Named after two English whaleships, the Pearl and the Hermes, that wrecked there in 1822, a few, small, sandy islands exist, contained within a lagoon and surrounded by a coral reef.  These islands are devoid of vegetation, except for several species of grasses. The total land area of all its islets is [tpl]convert|88.952|acre|ha[/tpl]. The atoll had its greatest importance within the pearl trade. In 1927, Captain William Greig Anderson was fishing for tuna and in the process, discovered pearl beds within the lagoon.  This opened up the first commercial activity within the atoll, but the pearl trade lasted for only a few years. The Hawaiian government later prohibited commercial activity and declared the area to be a bird sanctuary. In June 2006, George W. Bush declared the atoll and all other parts of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.
The endangered Laysan Finch was introduced to the island to provide a backup population of these birds, should a hurricane, disease, rat introduction, or other disaster wipe out the population on the island of Laysan.

[[Wc (Unix)]]

CATEGORIES: Unix text processing utilities, Unix SUS2008 utilities

wc (short for word count) is a command in Unix-like operating systems.
The program reads either standard input or a list of files and generates one or more of the following statistics: newline count, word count, and byte count. If a list of files is provided, both individual file and total statistics follow.
Sample execution of wc:
 $ wc foo bar
      40     149     947 foo
    2294   16638   97724 bar
    2334   16787   98671 total
The first column is the count of newlines, meaning that the text file foo has 40 newlines while bar has 2294 newlines- resulting in a total of 2334 newlines. The second column indicates the number of words in each text file showing that there are 149 words in foo and 16638 words in bar- giving a total of 16787 words. The last column indicates the number of characters in each text file, meaning that the file foo has 947 characters while bar has 97724 characters- 98671 characters all in all.
Newer versions of wc can differentiate between byte and character count. This difference arises with Unicode which includes multi-byte characters. The desired behaviour is selected with the -c or -m switch.
GNU wc used to be part of the GNU textutils package; it is now part of GNU coreutils.

The Conservative People's Party ([tpl]lang-de|Konservative Volkspartei[/tpl], KVP) was a short-lived German political party of the moderate right.  It broke away from the German National People's Party (DNVP) in the late 1920s as a result of that party's increasing radicalization under the leadership of Alfred Hugenberg. Its leading figures were Kuno von Westarp, Hugenberg's predecessor as chairman of the DNVP, and Gottfried Treviranus, who would serve in the cabinet of Heinrich Brüning from 1930 to 1932. It was unable to make any significant breakthrough in the subsequent elections. The party did not take part in the 1932 parliamentary elections (1930: 0,8%) and ceased to be politically active before the NSDAP outlawed all other parties in Germany and established a dictatorship.

[[Novitiate]]

Novitiate, alt. noviciate, is the period of training and preparation that a novice (or prospective) monastic, apostolic, or member of a religious institute undergoes prior to taking vows in order to discern whether she or he is called to vowed religious life.  It often includes times of intense study, prayer, living in community, studying the vowed life, deepening one's relationship with God, and deepening one's self-awareness. It is a time of creating a new way of being in the world.   The Novitiate stage in most communities is a two-year period of formation.Canon Law 653.1  These years are “Sabbath time” to deepen one's relationship with God, to intensify the living out of the community's mission and charism, and to foster human growth.  The Novitiate experience for many communities includes a concentrated program of prayer, study, reflection and limited ministerial engagement.  
"The Novitiate helps the Novice better understand her vocation to a particular Congregation.  Novices experience the manner of living, the culture of the Congregation.  This period helps form the minds and hearts of the Novices in the spirit of the Congregation so that their intention and suitability are tested." Canon Law 464.
"Conscious of their own responsibility, the Novices are to collaborate actively with their Director insuch a way that they faithfully respond to the grace of a divine vocation.Canon Law 652.3"  (Canon Law 652.3)
"Members of the institute are to take care that they cooperate for their part in the work of formation of the Novices through example of life and prayer".Canon Law 652.3 (Canon 652.3)
"Novices are to be led to cultivate human and Christian virtues; through prayer and self denial they are to be introduced to a fuller way of perfection; they are to be taught to contemplate the mystery of salvation and to read and meditate on the sacred scriptures; they are to be prepared to cultivate the worship of God in the sacred liturgy; they are to learn a manner of leading a life consecrated to God and humanity in Christ through the evangelical counsels; they are to be instructed regarding the character and spirit, the purpose and discipline, the history and life of the institute; and they are to be imbued with love for the Church."Canon Law 652  (Canon 652)
A novice is free to quit the novitiate at any time, and the Novice Director, Formation Director, or Superior is free to dismiss him or her with or without cause in most communtiies.
Often, in novicating, the vows are continuous through training.
In some novitiate communities, mostly monastic, the novice often wears clothing that is distinct from secular dress but is not the full habit worn by professed members of the community. The novice's day normally encompasses participation in the full canonical hours, manual labor, and classes designed to instruct novices in the religious life he is preparing to embrace. Spiritual exercises and tests of humility are common features of a novitiate. Some Roman Catholic communities encourage frequent confession and reception of Holy Communion by their novices.
A Superior will often appoint an experienced member of the community to oversee the training of novices. This may be a Finally Professed Member, novice master or mistress who is responsible for the training of all novices.
Different religious communities will have varying requirements for the duration of the novitiate. Often one must complete a postulancy before officially entering the novitiate.  In many apostolic religious communities in the United States, postulancy or candidacy is one to three years.   In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the novitiate is officially set at three years before one may be tonsured a monk or nun, though this requirement may be waived.
The term "novitiate" also refers to the building, house, or complex within a monastery or convent that is devoted exclusively to the needs of novices (sleeping, training, etc.).

[[Riverside Geyser]]

CATEGORIES: Geysers of Wyoming, Geothermal features of Teton County, Wyoming, Geothermal features of Yellowstone National Park

Riverside Geyser is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming.
The geyser is located on the Firehole River within the Upper Geyser Basin. The geyser shoots steam and water to heights of 75 feet (23 m) in an arch over the river, sometimes causing brilliant rainbows. The eruptions occur every 51⁄2 to 7 hours. As is Daisy, Riverside is one of the most predictable geysers in the park, because it is not located near any other geysers that may disrupt the flow of underground water in the geyser's plumbing. Riverside is unique in its way that eruptions seldom occur at the average interval for any given time. Instead, Riverside is bimodal, meaning it usually erupts 20 minutes before or 25 minutes late for a duration of 20 minutes. The bimodality does not represent a problem for predictions if the previous erupt time is seen. If not, you are predicting on doubles and triples, which leads to a wide range for uncertainty. For an hour or two before the eruption, water pours over the edge of the cone.[tpl]cite web |title=Riverside Geyser  |work= Old Faithful Area Tour |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/tours/oldfaithful/riversdg.htm[/tpl] The geyser was named by the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.[tpl]cite book |author=Bauer, Clyde Max |title=Yellowstone Geysers |location=Yellowstone Park, Wyoming |publisher=Haynes |year=1947 |oclc=1517713[/tpl]

[[Governor of Puerto Rico]]

CATEGORIES: Executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico, Governors of Puerto Rico, Commonwealth constitutional officers of Puerto Rico

The Governor of Puerto Rico is the head of government of Puerto Rico and by its nature constitutes the executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico. He is also the commander-in-chief of the commonwealth's military forces, the Puerto Rico National Guard.
The Governor has a duty to enforce state laws, to convene the Legislative Assembly, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly, to appoint government officers, to appoint Justices, and to grant pardons. Since 1948, the Governor has been elected by the people of Puerto Rico. Prior to that, the Governor was appointed either by the King of Spain (1510–1898) or the President of the United States (1898–1948).
Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico vests the executive power on the Governor and empowers him with the faculty to appoint officers. Law No. 104 of 1956Law No. 104 of 1956 empowers him with the faculty to delegate functions. These two faculties in conjunction allow the Governor to delegate most of his functions while continuing to be the maximum officer and head of government.
Most of the Governor's function are delegated to the Chief of Staff, who is charged with managing and overseeing all the executive departments and almost all executive agencies. The budget is delegated to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget while centralized planning is delegated to the President of the Planning Board. This effectively makes the Governor a political figure rather than an administrative one, allowing him to set the vision for what the island should be and where it should go rather than having to be involved in its day-to-day operations. Historically, however, Governors tend to be heavily involved in the day-to-day operations of the government in both internal and external affairs.

[[The Choirboys (novel)]]

CATEGORIES: 1975 novels, Novels by Joseph Wambaugh, Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department, Novels set in Los Angeles, California

thumb|right|200px|The cover of Joseph Wambaugh's classic police fiction story, "The Choirboys."The Choirboys (ISBN 0-440-11188-9), a novel, is a controversial 1975 work of fiction written by Los Angeles Police Department officer-turned-novelist Joseph Wambaugh.  In 1995 the novel was selected by the Mystery Writers of America as Number 93 of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time.
The Choirboys is a tragicomic parody about the effects of urban police work on young officers, seen through the exploits of a group of Los Angeles police officers in the Wilshire Division of the Los Angeles Police Department.  
A group of ten patrol officers on the nightwatch conducts end-of-shift get-togethers they euphemistically call "choir practices" (possibly to hide their true nature from superiors but actually a sardonic reference). These "choir practices" almost always involve heavy drinking, complaints about their superior officers, and war stories (and, occasionally, group sex with a pair of lusty, overweight barmaids). They hold the choir practices in MacArthur Park because it is in another division's territory and "one does not shit in one's own nest."   
Each of the officers is disillusioned, to varying degrees, that many of the people they're paid to protect are not unlike the suspects they arrest, and that the ridiculous regulations of their department are onerously enforced on them while their commanders (without skills in police work) indulge themselves hypocritically. Wambaugh's portrayals of the ten officers are stereotypes of varied types found in police departments in the 1970s, albeit well-drawn, but his most cutting descriptions are saved for the brutal "black-glove officer," Roscoe Rules. The theme of police officer suicide (also known as "eating your gun"), which runs through many of Wambaugh's books, provides a grim undercurrent to the black humor of the novel and suggests a sub-conscious motivation for their activities.
Due to the popularity of the book, the slang term "choir practice" became a somewhat popular euphemism for off-duty recreational activities even if it does not involve alcohol.
The Choirboys is considered an indictment of the LAPD hierarchy in several ways: 1) the choirboys' dislike and distrust of command-level officers; 2) the way the investigation into the shooting was handled; and 3) many of their superiors' apathetic attitudes about the pressures officers have to deal with. Wambaugh, however, summarized the conduct of the choirboys both on and off-duty by having Sgt. Yanov, their field supervisor, comment to his superior at the conclusion: "They weren't troublemakers...they were just policemen. Rather ordinary young guys. Maybe a little lonelier than some. Or scared."
Wambaugh's previous LAPD novels, The New Centurions and The Blue Knight, had been conventional and straightforward portrayals of his experiences. With The Choirboys he "found his voice," and thereafter his novels were stylistic lampoons of not only the Los Angeles police world but the Hollywood lifestyle, and often filled with black comedy. Wambaugh, by then a successful author, resigned from the LAPD after fourteen years of service in order to publish The Choirboys without retribution from those he burlesqued. The Choirboys is also significant in that Wambaugh turned to the bizarre anecdotes of others (which he terms "cop talk") to provide the grist for his writing after previously drawing from his own experience.

The Banu Hilal ([tpl]lang-ar|بنو هلال[/tpl]) were a confederation of Arabian Weiss, Bernard G. and  Green, Arnold H.(1987) A Survey of Arab History American University in Cairo Press, Cairo, p. 129, ISBN 977-424-180-0 tribes from Hejaz and Najd on the Arabian Peninsula.
They were part of the revolt of the Qarmatians against the Abbasids. They then settled in the Egyptian desert. Their fellows Banu Sulaym settled in the Eastern Libyan desert. They both settled in Mahdia in Tunisia, and raided Algeria from time to time, pushing the Hammadid dynasty from the Beni Hammad Fort in M'Sila to Bejaia. They were led by Abu Zayd al-Hilali. Their story is recounted in fictionalized form in Taghribat Bani Hilal. Their "saga" is still recounted in form of poetry in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt.
According to some authors, they migrated from Upper EgyptBallais, Jean-Louis (2000) "Chapter 7: Conquests and land degradation in the eastern Maghreb" p. 133  In Barker, Graeme and Gilbertson, David (2000) The Archaeology of Drylands: Living at the Margin Routledge, London, Volume 1, Part III - Sahara and Sahel,  pp. 125-136, ISBN 978-0-415-23001-8 into North Africa in the 11th century, having been sent by the Fatimids to punish the Berber dynasty of the Zirids for abandoning Shiism.

[[Brig o' Balgownie]]
CATEGORIES: Listed bridges in Scotland, Bridges completed in 1320, Category A listed buildings in Aberdeen

The Brig o' Balgownie (originally Bridge of Don) is a 13th-century bridge spanning the River Don in Old Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland.
Construction of the bridge was begun in the late 13th century by Richard Cementarius, although its completion was not until 1320 at the time of the Scottish War of Independence. After falling into disrepair in the mid 16th century it was extensively renovated in 1605.
Throughout its history the bridge has been considered an important asset. For five centuries possession of the bridge was the only way to move large armies quickly along the eastern coast of Aberdeenshire. It also provided a trade route to the wealthy areas of the north-east of Scotland.
The bridge is constructed of granite and sandstone. Its single gothic arch has span of over 12 metres and at low tide the apex of the arch lies over 17 metres above the water-line.
The bridge ceased to be a major route in 1830 when the new Bridge of Don was built five hundred yards downstream. Today it is open to foot and bicycle traffic only and is infamous throughout the student population of Aberdeen University where students jump off the bridge at high tide during the summer. However, rowdy students can still jump at low tide as the river is still deep enough at a fair 17 ft deep at low tide.

[[Loschmidt's paradox]]
CATEGORIES: Philosophy of thermal and statistical physics, Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Physical paradoxes

Loschmidt's paradox, first published by Sir William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, in 1874,The kinetic theory of the dissipation of energy, as reprinted in S. Brush, ed., Kinetic Theory, vol. 2, Pergamon Press, 1966, pp. 176--187, as quoted in Jan von Plato, Creating Modern Probability, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1994, p. 85. also known as the reversibility paradox, irreversibility paradox or [tpl]lang-de|Umkehreinwand[/tpl], is the objection that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from time-symmetric dynamics.  This puts the time reversal symmetry of (almost) all known low-level fundamental physical processes at odds with any attempt to infer from them the second law of thermodynamics which describes the behaviour of macroscopic systems. Both of these are well-accepted principles in physics, with sound observational and theoretical support, yet they seem to be in conflict; hence the paradox.
Johann Loschmidt's criticism was provoked by the H-theorem of Boltzmann, which was an attempt to explain using kinetic theory the increase of entropy in an ideal gas from a non-equilibrium state, when the molecules of the gas are allowed to collide.  In 1876, Loschmidt pointed out that if there is a motion of a system from time t0 to time t1 to time t2 that leads to a steady decrease of H (increase of entropy) with time, then there is another allowed state of motion of the system at t1, found by reversing all the velocities, in which H must increase.  This revealed that one of Boltzmann's key assumptions, molecular chaos, or, the Stosszahlansatz, that all particle velocities were completely uncorrelated, did not follow from Newtonian dynamics.  One can assert that possible correlations are uninteresting, and therefore decide to ignore them; but if one does so, one has changed the conceptual system, injecting an element of time-asymmetry by that very action.
Reversible laws of motion cannot explain why we experience our world to be in such a comparatively low state of entropy at the moment (compared to the equilibrium entropy of universal heat death); and to have been at even lower entropy in the past.

Don Juan DeMarco is a 1995 American romantic comedy-drama film starring Johnny Depp as John Arnold DeMarco, a man who believes himself to be Don Juan, the greatest lover in the world. Clad in a cape and domino mask, DeMarco undergoes psychiatric treatment with Marlon Brando's character, Dr. Jack Mickler, to cure him of his apparent delusion. But the psychiatric sessions have an unexpected effect on the psychiatric staff, some of whom find themselves inspired by DeMarco's delusion; the most profoundly affected is Dr. Mickler himself, who rekindles the romance in his complacent marriage.
The movie is based on two different sources; the modern-day story is based on director/screenwriter Jeremy Leven's short story Don Juan DeMarco and the Centerfold (the movie's original title before the studio changed it shortly before release), while the flashbacks depicting DeMarco's back-story are based on the more familiar legend of Don Juan, especially as told by Lord Byron in his version of the legend.
Depp received the London Film Critics Circle Award for Actor of the Year, along with his performance in Ed Wood while the film's theme song, "Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?", co-written and performed by Bryan Adams, was nominated for the Oscar, Grammy, and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

Kristin Halvorsen (born 2 September 1960 in) is a Norwegian socialist politician. She served as Minister of Finance from 17 October 2005 to 20 October 2009 and as Minister of Education from 20 October 2009 to 16 October 2013. 
Taking over as leader of the Socialist Left Party in 1997, she established an unprecedented level of consensus within the party. At the 2005 election, the party received a disappointing 8.8% share of the vote, and in 2009 down further, to 6.2%. Many who describe themselves as being on the left side of the party have suggested that Halvorsen step down. She was succeeded by Audun Lysbakken on 11 March 2012. 
The Socialist Left, in coalition with the Labour Party and the Centre Party, won Norway's September 2005 parliamentary elections. The resulting Red-Green coalition government marked the first time that the Socialist Left Party was included in the cabinet. Kristin Halvorsen took office as the 78th Minister of Finance in Norwegian history and the first woman ever to serve in that post.

[[Aeonium]]

CATEGORIES: Aeonium

Aeonium (tree houseleek) is a genus of about 35 species of succulent, subtropical plants of the family Crassulaceae. The name comes from the ancient Greek "aionos" (ageless). While most of them are native to the Canary Islands, some are found in Madeira, Morocco, and in East Africa (for example in the Semien Mountains of Ethiopia).
The rosette leaves are on a basal stem. Low-growing Aeonium species are A. tabuliforme and A. smithii; large species include A. arboreum, A. valverdense and A. holochrysum.
Aeonium are not frost-resistant. They are related to the genera Sempervivum, Aichryson and Monanthes, which is easy to see from their similar flower and inflorescences.  Recently, the genus Greenovia has been placed within Aeonium.

CATEGORIES: Flora of Madeira, Flora of the Canary Islands, Endemic flora

Monanthes is a genus of small, succulent, subtropical plants of the Crassulaceae family. The about ten species are mostly endemic to the  Canary Islands and Savage Islands, with some found on Madeira. Its center of diversity is Tenerife, with seven species occurring on this island. On Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, only M. laxiflora occurs.
Monanthes are not frost-resistant. They are linked with the genera Sempervivum, Greenovia, Aichryson and Aeonium, which is obvious from their similar flowers.
Species of Monanthes differ considerably in life- and growth-form. M. icterica, which is also genetically quite distant to other Monanthes species, is annual, while the other species are perennial.
Monanthes is a rare example where a species re-colonizes the continent from an island, after their ancestors have colonized the island from the continent.[tpl]fact|date=May 2009[/tpl]

[[Orthogastropoda]]

CATEGORIES: Available gastropod names, Patellogastropoda

Orthogastropoda was a major taxonomic grouping of snails and slugs, an extremely large subclass within the huge class Gastropoda according to the older taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder & Lindberg, 1997).
This taxon is no longer used according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005.
Ponder and Lindberg (1997) in the book The Southern Synthesis, showed the Orthogastropoda as one of two subclasses of the Gastropoda, the other subclass being a very much smaller group called the Eogastropoda, which contained only 5 families of true limpets. 
This subclass, Orthogastropoda, which one perhaps could call the true snails, was defined most concisely as all gastropods which were not members of Patellogastropoda, the true limpets. 
The Orthogastropoda appeared to form a clade which was supported by unambiguous synapomorphies. These synapomorphies (a series of characteristics that appear in its members but not in the other forms it diverged from) were the identifying characteristics of the clade. 
Some of the characteristics were:

Eugene Onegin, Op. 24, ([tpl]lang-ru|Евгений Онегин[/tpl], Yevgény Onégin) is an opera ("lyrical scenes") in 3 acts (7 scenes), composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The libretto, organised by the composer and Konstantin Shilovsky, very closely follows certain passages in Alexander Pushkin's novel in verse, retaining much of his poetry.  Shilovsky contributed M. Triquet's verses in Act 2, Scene 1, while Tchaikovsky wrote the words for Lensky's arioso in Act 1, Scene 1, and almost all of Prince Gremin's aria in Act 3, Scene 1.Richard Taruskin, Yevgeny Onegin, on p. 1191 in vol. 4 of [tpl]cite book | last = Sadie| first = Stanley (ed)| authorlink =Stanley Sadie | year = 1992| title = The New Grove Dictionary of Opera| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-522186-2[/tpl]
Eugene Onegin is a well-known example of lyric opera, to which Tchaikovsky added music of a dramatic nature. The story concerns a selfish hero who lives to regret his blasé rejection of a young woman's love and his careless incitement of a fatal duel with his best friend. 
The opera was first performed in Moscow in 1879.  There are several recordings of it, and it is regularly performed. The work's title refers to the protagonist.

The Henry VII Lady Chapel, now more often known just as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large Lady chapel at the far eastern end of Westminster Abbey, paid for by the will of Henry VII. It is separated from the rest of the abbey by brass gates and a flight of stairs.Trowles (2008); p. 131
The structure of the chapel is a three-aisled nave composed of four bays. The apse of the chapel contains the altar, and behind that, the tombs of Henry VII and his wife as well as of James I.  There are five apsidal chapels.
The chapel is noted for its pendant fan vault ceiling.
The chapel is built in a very late Perpendicular Gothic style, the magnificence of which caused John Leland to call it the orbis miraculum (the wonder of the world). The tombs of several monarchs including Henry VII, Edward VI, Elizabeth I, Mary I, James I, Charles II and Mary, Queen of Scots are found in the chapel.Lindley (2003); p. 208 
See People Buried Within Henry VII Chapel for a more complete list of burials within the chapel.

Mount Triglav, the highest mountain in Slovenia, is unlikely to have any connection to the Slavic deity Triglav.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 439. However, such a claim is made[tpl]by whom|date=March 2013[/tpl] for Mount Troglav, the highest peak of Dinara in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[tpl]cn|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Triglav is depicted as representation of three major Slavic gods that vary from one Slavic tribe to others that serve as the representatives of the above mentioned realms. An early variation included Svarog, Perun, and Dajbog. Later, Dajbog was replaced by Svetovid or Veles. Triglav is usually described as a fusion of these gods. 
Triglav is depicted as a three-headed man sometimes with bands of (gold) blindfolds over his eyes, or a man with three goat heads. Several temples dedicated to Triglav existed near present-day Szczecin, Poland. During the period of Christianization, these temples and statues of Triglav were completely destroyed.

[[Song of the Mary White]]

CATEGORIES: Ballads

"Song of the ''Mary White''" is a ballad written in Broadstairs, Britain around 1850.
It has been suggested that news of the loss of the Irish packet Royal Adelaide with 250 lives, on the sands off Margate on April 6, 1850, prompted old Thomas White to present one of his lifeboats to his home town of Broadstairs that summer. The lifeboat saw its first use on March 6, 1851 when the brig Mary White became trapped on the Goodwin Sands during a severe gale blowing from the north. A ballad was written to celebrate the occasion, the "Song of the Mary White". 
The lifeboat itself was subsequently named the Mary White in recognition of the strange coincidence of the recurrence of the name White in this story: Thomas and John the lifeboat builders, the name of the brig Mary White, and also the name of its captain, Mr White.

[[List of State Roads in Indiana]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Indiana, Lists of roads in Indiana

State Roads in the US state of Indiana are numbered rationally: in general, odd one-digit and two-digit highways are north-south highways, numbers increasing toward the west; even one-digit and two-digit highways are east-west highways, numbers increasing toward the south, the opposite of the United States Interstate System.
Three-digit routes are related, as a rule, to the single-digit or two-digit parent US or State route; thus State Road 205 is related to State Road 5 and State Road 120 is related to U.S. Route 20.
Exceptions to this system are 37, 47, 56, 57, 62, and 67, diagonal routes, the defunct "100" beltline around Indianapolis, State Road 135, which acts like a two-digit state highway, and both State Road 149 and State Road 249, which are arterial between State Road 49 and State Road 51. Another exception to the system is Indiana 265. This road is a two-mile extension that exists between Interstate 265 and Interstate 65 and is over 100 miles east of either Indiana 65 or Indiana 165, both located in Southwestern Indiana near Evansville.
The numbers of several important U.S. Highway routes that pass through Indiana are not used as Indiana route numbers:  these include 6, 12, 20, 24, 27, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 40, 41, 50, and 52.  U.S. 40, in fact, roughly corresponds in location to where "Indiana 40" would be; Indiana 38 is north of it and Indiana 42 is south of it.

CATEGORIES: Railway stations in Melbourne, Railway stations opened in 1889

Somerville railway station is located on the Stony Point line in Victoria, Australia. It serves the town of Somerville opening on 10 September 1889.Somerville Vicsig It opened due to rapid growth in the fruit (apples and pears) and dairy industries. The dairy industry needed a quick way of sending milk and cream to butter factories.
When the railway line reached Somerville, the station was a mile or so from the school and hall which at the time was located on Lower Somerville Road. The town centre moved from there to its current site.
Somerville station also operated as a post and telegraph office in the early years and was a centre where people met as they collected their mail. The investment in special railway sidings servicing new packing sheds and cool stores over a period of six years from 1914 to 1920 created expansion in the apple and pear growing industry. The advent of iced T wagons made it possible to load chilled fruit for quick transport to Melbourne docks and load directly into refrigerated ships for overseas destinations.
Up until the end of World War II a special train ran to the horticultural show at Somerville which was reputed to be one of the biggest of its kind in Australia. The railway line also helped the fruit tree nurseries, and family-operated companies such as Brunnings, Shepherds, Unthanks, Coles and Grants. They sent hundreds of thousands of bare-rooted trees all over Australia, to the Goulburn, the Murray Valley and Sunraysia in Victoria, the Riverina districts of New South Wales and to the Granite Belt area, centred on Stanthorpe in Queensland. This traffic was seasonal and took place from May to September.
The station building that stood on the platform at Somerville was a portable, meaning that it was delivered in sections and bolted together. The building contained an office and a safe working area from which the staff and ticket system was operated. There was a van shed for small goods and parcels, two waiting rooms, one for the ladies and a general waiting room, and toilets. In the station yard there was a general goods shed, a loading ramp and crane and livestock loading facility. Later, two sidings were built for the Somerville Co-operative Cool Stores.
The station master's house was located at the Frankston-Flinders Road entrance to the station.  Unfortunately, two Somerville youths set fire to the house during August 2009. The house was completely destroyed and the youths were apprehended, yet still await charge[tpl]when|date=February 2011[/tpl].
The station was usually staffed by the station master, but on occasions over the years he was assisted by a lad porter or assistant station master from Baxter. Somerville station was the banking station for all stations to Stony Point and supplied some of them with stores and stationary. Safeworking was originally the staff and ticketing system but this was varied from time to time until the opening of Long Island sidings when the electric staff system was introduced.

He travelled to Japan as a missionary in 1929 and became interested in that country's Buddhist practices.  In 1940, he became the vicar of Hiroshima, and on 6 August 1945 he was critically wounded by the nuclear blast in that city. Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany.
In September 1946, he had an audience with Pope Pius XII, in which he revealed his plan to build in Hiroshima a cathedral dedicated to the idea of world peace. Designed by Japanese architect Togo Murano, construction on the cathedral began in 1950 and on 6 August 1954, the Memorial Cathedral for World Peace （ja）was dedicated http://hiroshima.catholic.jp/~pcaph/cathedral/?page_id=2.
In 1956, Enomiya-Lassalle began studying Zen with Harada Daiun Sogaku.  In 1958, he published Zen: A Way to Enlightenment, but the Holy See ordered him not to continue publishing on the subject.
Following Harada's death in 1961, Enomiya-Lassalle became an apprentice of one of Harada's students, Yamada Koun.  Yamada was enthusiastic about the possibilities of Zen as a Christian practice, believing that "Zen would become an important stream in the Catholic Church one day".Terebess Asia Online  With Enomiya-Lassalle's active assistance, he attracted a number of Catholic priests and nuns as students.  In the late 1960s, Enomiya-Lasalle was certified as a teacher in Yamada's Sanbo Kyodan sect and given the title roshi (Zen master), while professing his continued belief in Christianity.  After 1968, Enomiya-Lassalle spent much of his time in Europe leading Zen retreats and encouraging Zen practice among Christians.  Then around 1983 he began to draw heavily from Jean Gebser,  Sri Aurobindo and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin to point to a new cultural paradigm based on integral consciousness.http://www.jean-gebser-gesellschaft.ch/TransDok/Jean%20Gebser%20and%20Zen.pdf
Lassalle published The Practice of Zen Meditation, (1987, Thorsons).

[[Jovibarba]]

CATEGORIES: Crassulaceae, Flora of Europe

Jovibarba ("beard of Jupiter") is a small genus of three species of succulent flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, endemic to mountainous regions in the southeastern quadrant of Europe. The genus is sometimes classified as a subgenus of Sempervivum, to which it is closely related. Jovibarba have pale-greenish-yellow or yellow actinomorphic flowers with about six petals, while Sempervivum have generally pinkish flowers with around twice as many petals, which open more widely than jovibarba flowers. The common name hen and chicks is applied to some Jovibarba species (and also species in several other Crassulaceae genera).
Jovibarbas, like sempervivums, reproduce via offsets in addition to producing seeds via sexual reproduction. Jovibarba heuffelii[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youngs-garden.com/sempervivum-hens-chicks/planting-hens-and-chicks/ |title=Planting and Growing Hens and Chicks |publisher=youngs-garden.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl] does not produce offsets on stolons. Instead the offspring of this plant are produced within the mother plant. To propagate it must be split with a knife. The other two jovibarba species are commonly called rollers. They produce offsets that are lightly attached and easily pop off and roll away from the mother plant. Offsets survive the main rosette, which is monocarpic.
Only three species are accepted as distinct by the Flora Europaea:
Jovibarba globifera and its subspecies (subsp. hirtum, subsp. allionii, subsp. arenaria) live in the eastern and southern Alps, the Carpathians and the western Balkans south to northern Albania. J. heuffelii occurs in the remainder of the Balkans and the eastern Carpathians, southeast of J. globifera. J. hirta occurs further west, in the southwestern Alps.

In quantum field theory, the term moduli (or more properly moduli fields) is sometimes used to refer to scalar fields whose potential energy function has continuous families of global minima.

The word moduli (moduln in German) first appeared in 1857 in Bernhard Riemann's celebrated paper "Theorie der Abel'schen Functionen"[ref]Bernhard Riemann, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, vol. 54 (1857), pp. 101-155

State Road 127 (SR 127) is a short north–south highway in northeast corner of the U.S. state of Indiana between U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Angola, Indiana and SR 120. Its present length was formerly a part of old US 27, whose designation was moved to the new Interstate 69 (I–69) when the freeway was completed in northern Indiana in 1967.
SR 127 is in fact a "child" of US 27; however, Indiana decommissioned all of US 27 north of Fort Wayne, so SR 127 no longer connects with US 27 anywhere. It functions in part to connect SR 120 to I–69 and, south of its interchange with I–69, it provides a local thoroughfare into Angola.  The last several miles of SR 127 north of Angola's town square are crowded with fast-food franchises and other national chains.
SR 127 also provides access, through the very short SR 727, to Pokagon State Park.

[[Offset (botany)]]

CATEGORIES: Plants

[tpl]Other uses|Offset (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Offset[/tpl]

In botany and horticulture, an offset is a small, virtually complete daughter plant that has been naturally and asexually produced on the mother plant. They are clones, meaning that they are genetically identical to the mother plant. In the plant nursery business and gardens, they are detached and grown on in order to produce new plants. This is a cheap and simple process for those plants that readily produce offsets as it does not usually require specialist materials and equipment.
Offsets form when meristem regions of plants, such as axillary buds or homologous structures differentiate into a new plant with the ability to become self-sustaining.  This is particularly common in species that develop underground storage organs, such as bulbs, corms and tubers. Tulips and lilies are examples of plants that display offset characteristics by forming cormlets around the original mother corm.
When propagating plants to increase a stock of a cultivar, thus seeking identical copies of parent plant, various cloning techniques (asexual reproduction) are used. Offsets are a natural means by which plants may be cloned.
In contrast, when propagating plants to create new cultivars, sexual reproduction through pollination is used to create seeds.  The recombination of genes gives rise to offspring plant with similar but distinct offspring genome.

It originally consisted of a short platform on the Up side of the line between the then (now former) park entrance road and the locomotive water tanks.  It had a nameboard with red flag, but no shelter.
Lakeside today is a Staff Station with passing loop and island platform with waiting shelters.  A Booking Office and Refreshment Room is across the track on what was an earlier single-faced platform.  There is also a dead end storage siding beyond the Down end of the platform.
Of interest is a working Wig-wag level crossing warning signal which operates at the former park access road between the platform and storage siding.  It is believed to be the only regularly operating Wig-wag signal remaining in Victoria.

There was originally a platform road and a loop siding, but a crossing loop was later added in between the two.  A single 12ft by 20 ft timber portable station building was provided which was later extended.  Other associated buildings such as toilets and a van good shed were also on the platform while a weatherboard goods shed was provided on the loop siding (No. 3 Road).
Today, the loop siding has been provided again along with the platform track, but the crossing loop is yet to be rebuilt.  A platform exists which initially had a temporary non-heritage building provided for safeworking purposes only, but during 2007 a heritage type building, obtained second-hand from another Victorian station, was relocated to Cockatoo.  Although it is not representative of the original building, it nevertheless is a typical building of the day and now provides a more suitable safeworking office than the non-heritage building previously used for this purpose, which was subsequently removed in 2009.

Chambers wrote most of the album, three songs co-written by her then husband Corey Hopper and her brother Nash Chambers produced the album – who had previously produced her first two solo albums. The album differs from her previous two because Chambers became a mother and she states it is the "most life changing things that you go through" and she did not feel any pressure recording the album. It debuted on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart at number-one making it Chambers second number-one album but the sales did not match up to her previous album Barricades & Brickwalls (2001) which was certified seven times platinum by ARIA.
The singles released from the album gave Chambers minor success in Australia giving her two top forty singles. "Like a River" was the first song released but was only released to radio and music video shows, it was received well being played on Video Hits and Rage many times. "Hollywood" was the second single released and the first as a CD single, it became Chambers fifth top forty hit in Australia. "Pony" was released at the start of 2005 and became Chambers third top ten single in Australia. The last single released was "Saturated" and was a minor hit peaking in the top one hundred. The album saw Chambers nominated for four ARIA Awards including "Best Cover Art", "Album of the Year", "Best Country Album" and "Best Female Artist" in 2004.

It was originally an unnamed platform, with time tables noting a station at [tpl]convert|38|mi[/tpl]. In 1929, local Harry Watson constructed a Mallee shed and unofficially named it Ancaster after his home town in Lincolnshire, England, but this was quickly changed by some children to Laura, who was a young local girl. The Victorian Railways officially named it Fielder from Tuesday 5 February 1929,Victorian Railways Weekly Notice No. 6/29 dated 5/2/29 after a nearby resident. It was planned to name the station after the two local residents Cullen and Fielder and combinations of the two names were suggested, however Fielder was the name finally chosen. It remained nothing more than a Mallee shed with small office and a name board for the rest of its operating life.
It was closed with the line on 30 April 1954 and the Mallee shed was sold to US Buslines for unknown use. After closure, the site fell into disrepair, and by the 1990s, little trace of Fielder remained.  However, by that time, efforts were being made to extend the railway from Lakeside through to Gembrook, which would complete the entire length of the original line.  In 1996, a group of volunteers led by Richard Schurmann in collaboration with the descendants of the Fielder family rebuilt the platform and waiting shed, which was officially re-opened on Saturday 19 April 1997 in preparation for the extension of the line which re-opened in 1998.

[[Gembrook railway station]]
CATEGORIES: Tourist railway stations in Melbourne

Gembrook Station is located in the township of Gembrook. It was opened with the line on 18 December 1900 and closed on 30 April 1954.
The line was rebuilt to the Gembrook terminus in 1998 by the Puffing Billy Railway. Heritage steam trains operated by Puffing Billy now stop at a new "Town" platform located on the site of a former siding. A "heritage" station has also been constructed on the site of the original Gembrook station. It has a layout very similar to that of the station in the 1920s, with only minor alterations to meet modern requirements.

Tea and Sympathy is a 1953 stage play in three acts by Robert Anderson.
The play is about a male private school student, Tom Lee, who faces accusations of homosexuality. A woman, Laura, who is married to an instructor, opposes the students' shaming of Lee and romantically pursues him so he can prove that he has a masculine character.Thomas, Bob.

[[Yarra Glen railway station]]
CATEGORIES: Tourist railway stations in Melbourne

Yarra Glen is the city-end terminus of the Healesville railway.
The first station on the site was built in 1888–1889 when the railway line was extended from Lilydale to Healesville. The settlement had been previously named Burgoyne, but when the railway was extended, the decision was made to rename it Yarra Glen. Though Yarra Glen was a small settlement, its station was often used for supplying Melbourne with produce from nearby farms.
The station closed along with the Healesville line in 1980. It sat idle for some years, and suffered some major fire damage to the roof, however the station is being restored as part of the Yarra Valley Railway, which is based out of Healesville. It currently opens on weekends and public holidays.
The Bushfires of late February and early March 2009 caused destruction to much of the grassland and forested areas of the Yarra Valley. This fire also caused the destruction of 2 timber trestle bridges between Yarra Glen Station and Healesville (only 2 small bridges between these 2 stations were lost, the main bridges that were lost were the Yarra Flat Trestles. These were the bridges between Yarra Glen and Yering, visible from the Melba Hwy when approaching Yarra Glen. These other 6 bridges were not part of the Yarra Valley Railway). Many of the sleepers were also burnt out (sleepers over approx 2 km of line were lost. This is outside the current running section of the Yarra Valley Railway). As a result, until reinstatement of the 2 bridges and rail to operating condition, Yarra Glen station is orphaned from the remaining part of the Healesville Line.
Additional fire activity also caused the burning and destruction of the timber bridges between Yarra Glen and Coldstream, resulting in the possible elimination of any future opportunity of reinstatement of railway services to Lilydale, without a significant amount of money/time.

[[Tarrawarra railway station]]
CATEGORIES: Tourist railway stations in Melbourne, Disused railway stations in Melbourne, Yarra Valley

Tarrawarra is a station on the former Healesville line between Yarra Glen and Healesville in Australia. The station, opened in 1889, closed along with the Healesville line in December 1980. The section of track through the location of the station is now maintained by the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway, which is based out of Healesville. A tourist service operates on weekends, and school and public holidays using restored 153 hp Walker railmotor RM22 to the estate Winery through the Tarrawarra tunnel, approx 3 km. before the former station. This service may be extended to Tarrawarra station in future.
In the 1970s, timetables showed "stop if required" because of the small number of passengers.
A new crossing loop was recently suggested near the site of the station.

[[Singular value]]
CATEGORIES: Operator theory, Singular value decomposition

In mathematics, in particular functional analysis, the singular values, or ''s''-numbers of a compact operator [tpl]nowrap|T : X → Y[/tpl] acting between Hilbert spaces X and Y, are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the non-negative self-adjoint operator [tpl]nowrap|T*T : X → X[/tpl] (where T* denotes the adjoint of T).
The singular values are non-negative real numbers, usually listed in decreasing order (s1(T), s2(T), …).  If T is self-adjoint, then the largest singular value s1(T) is equal to the operator norm of T (see Courant minimax principle).
In the case that T acts on euclidean space Rn, there is a simple geometric interpretation for the singular values: Consider the image by T of the unit sphere; this is an ellipsoid, and its semi-axes are the singular values of T (the figure provides an example in R2).
Most norms on Hilbert space operators studied are defined using s-numbers.  For example, the Ky Fan-k-norm is the sum of first k singular values, the trace norm is the sum of all singular values, and the Schatten norm is the pth root of the sum of the pth powers of the singular values.  Note that each norm is defined only on a special class of operators, hence s-numbers are useful in classifying different operators.
In the finite-dimensional case, a matrix can always be decomposed in the form  UDW, where U and W are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix with the singular values lying on the diagonal.  This is the singular value decomposition.

Dating back at least to the 1350s, the two towers of the chapel were a major landmark for sailors in the area. Given the veneration in which the shrine was held, the custom developed of ships dipping their top-sails to salute the shrine as they sailed past it.[tpl]citation | title=The Beauties of England and Wales, Or, Delineations, Topographical, Historical, and Descriptive, of Each County: Kent | volume=8 | first1= Edward | last1= Wedlake Brayley | authorlink1=Edward Wedlake Brayley | first2=John | last2=Britton  | publisher = Vernor and Hood | year=1808 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wYtCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA972 | page=972[/tpl] quoting John Lewis's History of the Isle of Thanet (1736)

[[Cytochrome P450]]

CATEGORIES: EC 1.14, Cytochrome P450, Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism, Integral membrane proteins

The cytochrome P450  superfamily of monooxygenases (officially abbreviated as CYP) is a large and diverse group of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of organic substances. The substrates of CYP enzymes include metabolic intermediates such as lipids and steroidal hormones, as well as xenobiotic substances such as drugs and other toxic chemicals.  CYPs are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and bioactivation, accounting for about 75% of the total number of different metabolic reactions.
The most common reaction catalyzed by cytochromes P450 is a monooxygenase reaction, e.g., insertion of one atom of oxygen into the aliphatic position of an organic substrate (RH) while the other oxygen atom is reduced to water:

RH + O2 + NADPH + H+ → ROH + H2O + NADP+

Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) belong to the superfamily of proteins containing a heme cofactor and, therefore, are hemoproteins. CYPs use a variety of small and large molecules as substrates in enzymatic reactions.They are in general the terminal oxidase enzymes in electron transfer chains, broadly categorized  as P450-containing systems. The term P450 is derived from the spectrophotometric peak at the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the enzyme (450 nm) when it is in the reduced state and complexed with CO.
CYP enzymes have been identified in all domains of life - animals, plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, archaea, and even in viruses.Lamb DC, Lei L, Warrilow AG, Lepesheva GI, Mullins JG, Waterman MR, Kelly SL (2009). "The first virally encoded cytochrome P450". Journal of Virology 83 (16): 8266-9.

Spike Breakwell (born Colin James Breakwell on 13 June 1968) is a British comedian. 
When Breakwell was four months old he became disabled through taking oral polio vaccine which caused a two-week coma.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article739384.ece|title=Inside story: spinal muscular atrophy|author=Spike Breakwell|work=The Times |location=UK|date=11 March 2006|accessdate=8 October 2008[/tpl] He was brought up in Dunstable, and "treated and raised to be as stubborn and independent as anyone else round about." In his teens he attended Lord Mayor Treloar College in Alton, Hampshire, now Alton College.
Breakwell was the first wheelchair-using comedian on the London alternative club circuit from 1992, appearing on stage and BBC2 television. His act always started with the line: "...I don't know what I've been drinking but I could walk half an hour ago!" Surprisingly, fans never tired of this.
He also co-wrote and co-starred (with Simon Hardeman) in the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe shows On The Toilet With Shergar (An Evening of Horseplay and Lavatory Humour ) in 1992, Simon and Spikes Laugh-In in 1993 and the critically acclaimed play looking at comedy Death Of A Comedian in 1994. 
He co-wrote (with Simon Hardeman) the Beginners' Guide column in The Times Magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.simonhardeman.com/beginners.html|title=The Beginners' Guide: selected cuttings from The Times Saturday Magazine|author=Simon Hardeman and Spike Breakwell|work=Simon Hardeman, writer, comedian, knurler|date=19 November 2007|accessdate=31 January 2009[/tpl] 
He has also been a regular in a BBC disability magazine programme.
In January 2006 Breakwell and part of the Wheelabout expedition team drove across Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.podcastfm.co.uk/about.php?guid=115740419444fc96240d225|title=5 Minute Travel » Blood, Sweat & Beers|work=Podcast FM|date=4 September 2006|accessdate=8 October 2008[/tpl] He had planned to become the first person to cross from Perth to Sydney (4600 miles) in an electric wheelchair. However, funding for the trip failed to materialise and it is yet to be completed.
In October 2007 he appeared in his first Hollywood film, Dante's Criterion, described as a supernatural horror story of a possessed television, as "Ziggy Fontain" a wheelchair-using TV advertising producer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334525/|title=Dante's Criterion (2009)|work=IMDb (The Internet Movie Database)|year=2009|accessdate=29 January 2009[/tpl] He is co-writing (with British screenwriter Lucy Soper) The Pommie, a comedy feature film for Hollywood-based Guvnor Films.

The play is based on the life of Guillaume Le Gentil (1725–1792), a gentleman astronomer.
In the play, he is obsessed with observing the transit of Venus. He leaves Celeste, the girl who loves him, to embark on an expedition to observe it. He returns after six years, having failed to observe the transit. He immediately makes preparations for a new expedition to observe the next transit.
Some artistic license has been taken: the real-life Guillaume Le Gentil did not return until after the second transit, remaining overseas during the eight-year interim.
The play was subsequently performed across Canada, by the Royal Shakespeare Company and the BBC.

CATEGORIES: Ecological techniques, Conservation in Australia, Ecological restoration

Bush regeneration, a form of natural area restoration,  is the term used in Australia for the ecological restoration of remnant vegetation areas, such as through the minimisation of negative disturbances, both exogenous such as exotic weeds and endogenous such as erosion. It may also attempt to recreate conditions of pre-European arrival, for example by simulating endogenous disturbances such as fire. Bush regeneration attempts to protect and enhance the floral biodiversity in an area by providing conditions conducive to the recruitment and survival of native plants. Bushcare's Major Day Out is an Australian national day of community participation in the care of bushland. In 2012 nearly 100 bushcare sites participated in this annual event.

Little is known about the unconscious mind or about how decisions are made based on unconscious communications except for the fact that they are always unintentional. There are two types of unconscious communications: intrapersonal and interpersonal.
Research has shown that our conscious attention can attend to 5–9 items simultaneously. All other information is processed by the unconscious mind. For example, the unconscious mind sometimes picks up on and relates nonverbal cues about an individual based on how he or she has arranged his or her settings such as his or her home or place of work.

James Walter "Cinderella Man" Braddock (June 7, 1905 – November 29, 1974) was an American boxer who was the world heavyweight champion from 1935–37.
Fighting under the name James J. Braddock (ostensibly to follow the pattern set by two prior world boxing champions, James J. Corbett and James J. Jeffries), he was known for his powerful right hand, solid chin and comeback from a floundering career. He had lost several bouts due to chronic hand injuries and was forced to work on the docks and collect social assistance to feed his family during the Great Depression. In 1935 he fought Max Baer for the Heavyweight title and won. For this unlikely feat he was given the nickname "Cinderella Man" by Damon Runyon. Braddock was managed by Joe Gould.

Rhodesia, which became a self-governing colony of Britain in 1923, unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965, and was thereafter an unrecognised state in practice until 1979. In December 1979, the country came under temporary British control, and in April 1980 the country gained recognised independence as Zimbabwe.
Rhodesia's political system was modelled on the Westminster system, and the Prime Minister's role was similar to that of the same position in other countries with similar constitutional histories – Canada, for example, or Australia.

It was produced in three separate generations from 1970 to 1988, beginning with rear-wheel drive and ending up as a front-wheel drive J-car derivative. In motorsport, the Ascona 400 rally car driven by Walter Röhrl won the World Rally Championship drivers' title in the 1982 season.
The Ascona took its name from the lakeside resort of that name in Ticino, Switzerland, and already in the 1950s a special edition of the Opel Rekord P1 was sold as an Opel Ascona in Switzerland, where the name was again used in 1968 for a locally adapted version of the Opel Kadett B into which the manufacturers had persuaded a 1.7-litre engine borrowed from the larger Rekord model of the time.[tpl]cite journal| journal = Autocar |number = 3762 | volume =128 | first = Geoffrey | last = Howard | editor-first = Maurice A. | editor-last = Smith | title = Geneva: Motor Show report | pages =  50–56| date = 1968-03-21 [/tpl] The Opel Ascona A launched in 1970 and sold across Europe was, however, the first mainstream Opel model to carry the name.

[[Annianus of Alexandria]]
CATEGORIES: Byzantine theologians, Byzantine historians, 5th-century historians, 5th-century Byzantine people, Egyptian Christian monks

Annianus of Alexandria or Annianos was a monk who flourished in Alexandria during the bishopric of Theophilus of Alexandria around the beginning of the fifth century. He criticized the world history of his contemporary monk Panodorus of Alexandria for relying too much on secular sources rather than biblical sources for his dates.
As a result, Annianus developed his own chronology which placed Creation on 25 March 5492 BC. This created the Alexandrian Era whose first day was the first day of the proleptic Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC. This year was eleven Paschal cycles of 532 years each before the Alexandrian year beginning 29 August 360, which itself was four 19-year cycles after the epoch of the Diocletian Era on 29 August 284. The former is known as the Era of Grace in the Coptic Church, whereas the latter is known as the Era of Martyrs. He was the first computist to recognize the 532-year cycle of Easters in the Julian calendar. This cycle is often attributed to Victorius of Aquitaine in 457, the first to recognize such a cycle in the West.
None of Annianus' writings has survived; he is known only from the discussion of his works by George Syncellus during the ninth century.

[[Montague grammar]]
CATEGORIES: Grammar, Semantics, Formal languages, Lambda calculus

Montague grammar is an approach to natural language semantics, named after American logician Richard Montague. The Montague grammar is based on formal logic, especially higher order predicate logic and lambda calculus, and makes use of the notions of intensional logic, via Kripke models. Montague pioneered this approach in the 1960s and early 1970s.
Montague's thesis was that natural languages (like English) and formal languages (like programming languages) can be treated in the same way:
 
 There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single natural and mathematically precise theory. On this point I differ from a number of philosophers, but agree, I believe, with Chomsky and his associates. (Universal Grammar 1970)

Montague published what soon became known as Montague grammarThe linguist Barbara Partee credibly claims to have invented the term in 1971 “for the system spelled out in Montague's“ UG, EFL and “especially in PTQ”. See her essay "Reflections of a Formal Semanticist as of Feb 2005", p. 14, footnote 36. in three seminal papers:
In a 2004 paper,[ref]See
Continuations in Natural Language, Chris Barker,  extended abstract for Fourth ACM-SIGPLAN Continuation Workshop ’04 Venice, Italy[/ref] Chris Barker linked Montague's treatment of quantification to the notion of continuation in programming language semantics.

[[Protection racket]]

CATEGORIES: Extortion, Organized crime

A protection racket is a scheme whereby a criminal group provides protection to businesses through violence outside the sanction of the law.  Through the credible threat of violence, the racketeers deter people from swindling, robbing, injuring, sabotaging or otherwise harming their clients.  Protection rackets tend to appear in markets where the police and judiciary cannot be counted on to provide legal protection, either because of incompetence (as in weak or failed states) or illegality (black markets).
Protection rackets are not the same as extortion rackets. In an extortion racket the racketeers agree not to attack a business. In a protection racket the racketeers agree to defend a business from any attack. However, they may threaten to attack or attack the business if it denies protection.
Certain scholars, such as Diego Gambetta, classify criminal organizations engaged in protection racketeering as mafia.

In cryptography, mod ''n'' cryptanalysis is an attack applicable to block and stream ciphers. It is a form of partitioning cryptanalysis that exploits unevenness in how the cipher operates over equivalence classes (congruence classes) modulo n. The method was first suggested in 1999 by John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, and David Wagner and applied to RC5P (a variant of RC5) and M6 (a family of block ciphers used in the FireWire standard). These attacks used the properties of binary addition and bit rotation modulo a Fermat prime.

Saint Gottschalk (or Godescalc) ([tpl]lang-la|Godescalcus[/tpl]) (died 6 June 1066) was a prince of the Obotrite confederacy from 1043 to 1066. He established a Slavic kingdom on the Elbe (in the area of present-day northeastern Germany) in the mid-11th century. His object in life seems to have been to collect the scattered tribes of the Slavs into one kingdom, and to make that kingdom Christian.Cambridge, 806.
"A pious and god-fearing man",Adam of Bremen Gottschalk effected the Christianisation of the Slavic tribes of the Elbe. He organised missions of German priests and founded monasteries at Oldenburg, Mecklenburg, Ratzeburg, Lübeck, and Lenzen, erecting the first three into dioceses. He himself often accompanied the missionaries on their work and augmented their message with his own explanations and instructions. In all this, he was supported by the efforts of Adalbert, Archbishop of Hamburg. However, the Obotrite nobility and peasantry largely remained pagan.

CATEGORIES: 2004 films, American films, German films, English-language films, 2000s adventure films, Adventure comedy films, American children's films, Independent films, Films based on works by Jules Verne, Films directed by Frank Coraci, Walt Disney Pictures films, Films set in the 1870s, Films set in London, Films set in Paris, Films set in San Francisco, California, Martial arts films, Walden Media films, Martial arts comedy films, Babelsberg Studio films

Around the World in 80 Days is a 2004 American-German adventure comedy film based on Jules Verne's novel of the same name. It stars Jackie Chan, Steve Coogan and Cécile de France. The film is set in 19th-century Britain and centers on Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan), here reimagined as an eccentric inventor, and his efforts to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. During the trip, he is accompanied by his Chinese valet, Passepartout (Jackie Chan). For comedic reasons, the film intentionally deviated wildly from the novel and included a number of anachronistic elements.
With production costs of about $110 million and estimated marketing costs of $30 million, it earned $24 million at the U.S. box office and $72 million worldwide, making it a box office bomb. The film finally turned a profit in DVD sales.
The film is notable for being Arnold Schwarzenegger's last film before he took a hiatus from acting to become Governor of California.

The Fosse Ardeatine massacre ([tpl]lang-it|Eccidio delle Fosse Ardeatine[/tpl]) was a mass killing carried out in Rome on 24 March 1944 by  German occupation troops during the Second World War as a reprisal for a partisan attack conducted on the previous day in central Rome against the SS Police Regiment Bozen.
Subsequently, the Ardeatine Caves site (Fosse Ardeatine)Fosse (plural of fossa – "ditch"), is the Italian word used for "mass gravesite". was declared a Memorial Cemetery and National Monument open daily to visitors. Every year, on the anniversary of the slaughter and in the presence of the senior officials of the Italian Republic, a solemn State commemoration is held at the monument in honor of the fallen. Popes Paul VI and John Paul II each visited the memorial once during their respective reigns, as did Pope Benedict XVI on 27 March 2011.

[[Antonomasia]]
CATEGORIES: Rhetorical techniques

In rhetoric, antonomasia is a substitution of any epithet or phrase for a proper name, such as  "the little corporal" for Napoleon I. The reverse process is also sometimes called antonomasia. The word derives from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἀντονομασία[/tpl], antonomasia, itself from the verb [tpl]lang|grc|ἀντονομάζειν[/tpl], antonomazein, meaning "to name differently".[tpl]LSJ|a)ntonomasi/a|ἀντονομασία[/tpl],[tpl]LSJ|a)ntonoma/zw|ἀντονομάζειν|ref[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=antonomasia|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antonomasia&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary[/tpl][tpl]1911[/tpl] Antonomasia is a particular form of metonymy.
The name used to substitute an abstract notion or personal trait is commonly called archetype or, more specifically, archetypal name.
A frequent instance of antonomasia in the Late Middle Ages and early Renaissance was the use of the term "the Philosopher" to refer to Aristotle.  A more recent example of the other form of antonomasia (usage of archetypes) was the use of "Solons" for "the legislators" in 1930s journalism, after the semi-legendary Solon, lawgiver of Athens.

Hass was not charged with or convicted of war crimes following the war, but the reprisal killings of some 335 Italians following a partisan attack on German troops in Rome is one of the most notorious events of World War II. His involvement as a witness in the Erich Priebke trial led him to being tried and convicted in Italy for the Ardeatine killings in 1998.

[[Micro black hole]]

CATEGORIES: Black holes, Hypothetical astronomical objects, Hypothetical particles

Micro black holes, also called quantum mechanical black holes or mini black holes, are hypothetical tiny black holes, for which quantum mechanical effects play an important role.B.J. Carr and S.B. Giddings, "Quantum black holes",Scientific American 292N5 (2005) 30.
It is possible that such quantum primordial black holes were created in the high-density environment of the early Universe (or big bang), or possibly through subsequent phase transitions. They might be observed by astrophysicists in the near future, through the particles they are expected to emit by Hawking radiation.
Some hypotheses involving additional space dimensions predict that micro black holes could be formed at an energy as low as the TeV range, which are available in particle accelerators such as the LHC (Large Hadron Collider). Popular concerns have then been raised over end-of-the-world scenarios (see Safety of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider). However, such quantum black holes would instantly evaporate, either totally or leaving only a very weakly interacting residue. Beside the theoretical arguments, we can notice that the cosmic rays bombarding the Earth do not produce any damage, although they reach center of mass energies in the range of hundreds of TeV.

Ernest F. Pletschke is the name of the surveyor who platted Houghton, Michigan in 1854, prior to its incorporation as a village in 1861. In Houghton's first days it was said that "only thieves, crooks, murderers and Indians" lived there.
An Ernest F. Pletschke, most likely the same individual (though this is by no means certain) also was a leading citizen of nearby Outagamie County, Wisconsin during the American Civil War era. This Pletschke was a professor of German at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. In November 1860, he and forty students formed a local militia company, with Pletschke as Captain and a Professor Pomeroy as First Lieutenant.
In April 1861, Professor Pletschke became the captain of the Appleton Light Infantry, with one T.R. Rudd as First Lieutenant. On May 31, 1861, Pletschke offered the services of his company to Adjutant-General William L. Utley in the Union's battle against the southern rebels; Utley accepted in early June, noting that the Appleton Light Infantry would likely be called upon within ten days. They were mustered into service soon after. His command was folded into the regiment of Colonel Frank J. Hecker of Illinois, where his captaincy was confirmed and made official.
Pletschke died in October 1861 at Louisville, Kentucky as a result of a relapse of typhoid fever, which he had contracted at some earlier, unspecified time. He was survived by a widow and a daughter.  His funeral was held in the Lawrence Memorial Chapel at Lawrence University.

It is hosted and administered by the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet, headquartered at Pearl Harbor, in conjunction with the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, and Hawaii National Guard forces under the control of the Governor of Hawaii. The US invites allied military forces from the Pacific Rim nations to participate. With RIMPAC the United States Pacific Command seeks to enhance interoperability between Pacific Rim armed forces, ostensibly as a means of promoting stability in the region to the benefit of all participating nations. The Pacific faces several potential targets which the United States Department of Defense believes may require naval force-on-force engagements, especially China and North Korea.

The promontory extends 1 mi (1.6 km) perpendicular to the coast, and is approximately 0.25 mi (0.5 km) wide at its base, tapering as it extends outward from the coast. Cape Lookout State Park is located on the north side of the promontory, which is part of the Siuslaw National Forest.
The Cape Lookout Trail is a popular hiking trail, extending 2.5 miles through Sitka spruce forest to the tip of the promontory.  The cliff-top viewpoint offers views of Cape Kiwanda and Cascade Head to the south, and Cape Meares and Neahkahnie Mountain to the north.  Migrating whales can also be seen, generally from December through June.
During World War II, the cape was the location of a notable crash of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber.  There was one survivor (the bombardier), Wilbur L. Perez. A plaque on the cape memorializes the victims of the crash.

Plants are biennials or short-lived perennials, native to Eurasia and cultivated in many other areas of the world for their attractive, spring-blooming flowers. In some of those areas, it has escaped cultivation and become a weed species. The genus name Hesperis is Greek for evening, and the name was probably given because the scent of the flowers becomes more conspicuous towards evening.[tpl]Cite book | author=Britton, N.

[[The Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology books, Works by Max Weber

The Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism is an essay written by Max Weber,
The essay is based on Weber's observations of American businessmen in 1904, during a trip he took to visit relatives in Ohio and North Carolina, and to do research in the libraries of American universities that had Protestant affiliations. Despite the strict Separation of Church and State in the US, businessmen never failed to ask (casually) about each other's religious affiliations. Weber eventually realized that this odd custom (from a European point of view) acted as a kind of "credit check".Protestant Sects and The Spirit of Capitalism, p1.
This worked for two reasons. First, membership in a Protestant sect was voluntary (unlike the state-sponsored Churches in Europe), and they only accepted members who had demonstrated a certain standard of behavior. Any member who failed to behave as expected would face pressure to reform, or lose his membership. Therefore, any member in good standing could be trusted in business (regardless of which sect he belonged to).Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism, p3.
Second, the Protestant sects were run by their members, and the pastor was their employee (unlike state-sponsored Churches, where the pastor might be a political appointee). If a pastor became lax or corrupt, the members could replace him.  Congregations also insisted that their pastors should preach ethics, rather than the finer points of religious dogma (which they considered to be less important than ethical behavior).Protestant Sects and The Spirit of Capitalism, p7-8.
As the influence of religion declined (particularly in the larger cities), this function had been taken up by secular businessmen's organizations. Again, these organizations only accepted members who demonstrated a certain standard of behavior, and that standard was enforced by the members rather than the hierarchy. Traveling salesmen would always be sure to wear a lapel pin indicating membership in one organization or another, because without such an affiliation, people wouldn't trust them. Joining such an organization was often a sign that an immigrant was becoming assimilated into American culture.Protestant Sects and The Spirit of Capitalism, p7.
Both the religious and secular versions of this phenomenon were already dying out in the larger cities. In his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber theorized that having a large number of businessmen who could be counted on to behave ethically was important to the growth of Capitalism, and that this had its origins in the Protestant Reformation (particularly in Calvinism and its spiritual descendants), although it had later become secularized.Protestant Sects and The Spirit of Capitalism, p9-14.

[[Science as a Vocation]]

CATEGORIES: Sociology books, Works by Max Weber

Science as a Vocation (Wissenschaft als Beruf) is the text of a lecture given in 1917 at Munich University by German sociologist and political economist Max Weber. The original version was published in German, but various translations to English exist.
In Science as a Vocation Weber discusses the benefits and detriments of choosing a graduate career in the sciences. He probes the question "what is the value of science", noting that ethics themselves are not subject to scientific examination. Science, to Weber, gives methods of explanation and means of justifying a position, but it cannot explain why that position is worth holding in the first place; this is the task of philosophy. No science is free from suppositions, and the value of a science is lost when its suppositions are rejected.
He reasons that science can never answer the fundamental questions of life, such as directing people on how to live their lives and what to value. Value he contends can only be derived from personal beliefs such as religion. He further argues for the separation of reason and faith, noting that each has its place in respective field but if crossed over cannot work.
Weber also separates fact from value in politics. He argues that a teacher should impart knowledge to students and teach them how to clarify issues logically – even political issues – but teachers should never use the classroom to indoctrinate or preach their personal political views.
Weber also makes some practical comments about research. He notes that good scholars can be poor teachers, and that qualities that make one a good scholar, or a good thinker, are not necessarily the same qualities that make for good leaders or role models.

[[Politics as a Vocation]]

CATEGORIES: Political science books, Sociology books, 1919 books, Works by Max Weber, Sociology index

Politics as a Vocation (Politik als Beruf) is an essay by German economist and sociologist Max Weber. It originated in a lecture he gave to the Free Students Union of Munich University, in January 1919, during the German Revolution.
In his essay Weber states that politics is the art of compromise and decision making based on social benefits weighed against costs; in this respect, political action cannot be rooted only in conviction, since one's conviction can be another's social anathema. Using as an example Christianity, seen as a core conviction, Weber affirms that a politician cannot only be a man of "true Christian ethic" (understood in terms "turning the other cheek"). The political realm is no realm for saints. A politician should marry the ethic of ultimate ends with an ethic of responsibility. The latter, which is the ultimate criterion for judging politicians, should take into account all that is at stake in making a political decision, namely all the convictions and the relative weight and moral importance. A politician must possess both passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).
The lecture introduces a definition of the state that has become pivotal to Western social thought: that the state is that entity which claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of force, which it may therefore elect to delegate as it sees fit. Politics is to be understood as any activity in which the state might engage in order to influence the relative distribution of force. Politics thus comes to obtain two power-based concepts, to be understood as deriving of power.[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2011[/tpl]

The Law of the Soviet Union was the law developed in the Soviet Union (USSR) following the October Revolution of 1917. Modified versions of the Soviet legal system were adopted by many Communist states following the Second World War including Mongolia, the People's Republic of China, the Warsaw Pact countries of eastern Europe, Cuba and Vietnam.
Soviet legal system regarded law as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government. The system was designed to protect the state from an individual, rather than to protect an individual from the state. Extensive extra-judiciary powers were given to the Soviet secret police agencies.

King Arthur is a 2004 film directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by David Franzoni. It stars Clive Owen as the title character, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, and Keira Knightley as Guinevere.
The film is unusual in reinterpreting Arthur as a Roman officer rather than a medieval knight.  Despite these departures from the source material, the Welsh Mabinogion, the producers of the film attempted to market it as a more historically accurate version of the Arthurian legends, supposedly inspired by new archaeological findings. The film was shot in England, Ireland, and Wales.

[[Sixes River]]

CATEGORIES: Oregon Coast, Rivers of Oregon, Klamath Mountains, Landforms of Curry County, Oregon

The Sixes River flows about [tpl]convert|31|mi|km|0[/tpl] through coastal forests in southwestern Oregon in the United States. It drains a rugged region of the Klamath Mountains along the Pacific north of Port Orford.
It rises in the mountains of northern Curry County, south of Sugarloaf Mountain in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest. It flows generally west, through Grassy Knob Wilderness and the small community of Sixes, and eventually enters the Pacific just north of Cape Blanco, the westernmost point in Oregon. The mouth of the river is along the coast in Cape Blanco State Park.
Accounts vary as to the origin of the name "Sixes". One local postmaster said Sixes was named for a Native American chief. Another source said that in 1851, the river was usually called the "Sikhs River" after the Chinook Jargon word for "friend", and on maps it was called the "Sequalchin River". Another source says the Native American name for the river was "Sa-qua-mi". Hodge's Handbook of American Indians says that one of the variants of the name of the local tribe, the Kwatami (a subdivision of the Tututni), was "Sik-ses-tene", which is said to mean "people by the far north country". Though this is most likely the real source of the name, the spelling "Sixes" was probably used by miners drawn to the Oregon gold rush who were familiar with the Chinook word "sikhs". The current spelling was used as early as 1855.

The Samsung SCH-V200 camera was only half-integrated. It shared the same case and battery but was not integrated with the phone function. It certainly could not convey an image "at a distance" thus not conforming to the tigher definition of a camera phone. The image of the SCH-V200 had to be down-loaded by wire to a PC. The Sharp SH04 was integrated both mechanically and electronically and could convey the captured image at a distance.  It was the point of origin of today's mobile camera phones.

While orthodoxies make use of codified beliefs, in the form of creeds, and ritualism more narrowly centers on the strict adherence to prescribed rites or rituals, orthopraxy is focused on issues of family, cultural integrity, the transmission of tradition, sacrificial offerings, concerns of purity, ethical systems, and the enforcement thereof.[tpl]cite book |last=Antes |first=Peter |coauthors=Armin W.

In the case of Hinduism orthopraxy and ritualism are mixed to the point that they become a single identity.

The Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE), based in Bozeman, Montana, is an American think-tank that promotes free-market environmentalism. FREE emphasizes reliance on market mechanisms and private property rights, rather than on environmental regulation, for protection of the environment. Its chairperson, John Baden, a past member of the National Petroleum Council, stresses decentralization: a shift of control from what he calls "Green platonic despots" in the federal government to "local interests".More environmental Gore, John Baden, April 26, 1999  Citing conservation efforts such as those involving the Rocky Mountain Elk, Pheasants Forever, and Trout Unlimited, Baden asserts that the ideas FREE promotes have become "the norm among progressive, intellectually honest and successful environmentalists".What was once radical now becoming mainstream, John Baden, May 9, 2001, originally published in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.

[[Tribute act]]

CATEGORIES: Tribute acts, Types of musical groups

A tribute act is a music group, singer, or musician who specifically plays the music of a well-known music act - sometimes one which has disbanded, ceased touring or is deceased. Probably the largest class of tributes acts are Elvis impersonators, individual performers who mimic the songs and style of Elvis Presley. However, most tribute acts are groups (tribute band or tribute group) and are tributes to a group. For example, The Iron Maidens are an all-female band that pays tribute to Iron Maiden.
A tribute band does not include members of the original band whose music is being honored. If a member is included in a band performing the music of their original group, the band is seen as a spin-off band rather than a tribute band. However, guest appearances do occur. For example, former Bruce Springsteen drummer Vini Lopez often plays sets with the Springsteen tribute band The E Street Shuffle and original Deep Purple Drummer Ian Paice often plays with the tribute band Purpendicular on small European tours. 
The main way in which a tribute band differs from a cover band that simply plays songs by other artists is that it strives to capture every nuance of the imitated artist's actions and appearance for a perfect imitation. Some tribute bands imitate the appearance but re-interpret the original works in a particular genre or for comic effect. For example, Dread Zeppelin plays Led Zeppelin songs in a reggae style with a lead singer dressed up as Elvis Presley, while Gabba perform the songs of ABBA in the style of The Ramones. There are also individuals who are tributes of a group, and vice versa.
Tribute bands usually name themselves based on the original band's name, some song and even albums.

Straperlo was a business which tried to introduce in Spain in the 1930s a fraudulent roulette which could be controlled electrically with the push of a button. The ensuing scandal was one of the causes of the fall of the government and the polarization of the parliament, which led to the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).
The name had its origin in the names of the Dutch partners one of which was Daniel Strauss but sources differ on the exact name or names of the others. Some sources say there was just one other partner called Jules Perel.  Some sources state there was a third female partner called Lowann who was the wife of Strauss.Estraperlo in the Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico, by Joan Corominas and José Antonio Pascual, Madrid: Editorial Gredos, 1989. ISBN 84-249-1363-9.
In 1935 they used their influence with the upper levels of the government to install the roulette in the casino Kursaal in San Sebastian but the police discovered the fraud and it was forbidden. As the business had invested a lot of money in the venture they tried to recover it by blackmailing the prime minister, Alejandro Lerroux, because his nephew was involved in the business and in the trafficking of influence.  Lerroux refused to get involved and Strauss denounced the case to the president of the republic, Niceto Alcala Zamora who made it public.  The reaction of the parties in the opposition caused the  fall of Lerroux and his Radical Republican Party government.
After the scandal and more so after the Spanish Civil War the word was incorporated as "estraperlo" into the Spanish language with the meaning of any business which is illegal or corrupt. Most often it refers to smuggling.estraperlo in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Española.

Blå Jungfrun ("blue virgin"), or "Blåkulla", is a Swedish island in the Baltic Sea. More precisely, it is situated in Kalmar Strait, between the provinces Småland and Öland. Administratively, it belongs to the municipality Oskarshamn. It is uninhabited and has an area of only about 0.7 km², though it rises 86 metres above sea level. Since 1926, it is one of the national parks of Sweden, and the Everyman's right at Blå Jungfrun is limited: one cannot stay overnight on the island or make a fire.
The island consists partly of bare rock, partly of dense hardwood forest. The black guillemot is a characteristic bird. There are several caves and an ancient monument, a stone labyrinth, an early historical structure on the island. It is forbidden to remove stones from the labyrinth.

[[Strategy-stealing argument]]
CATEGORIES: Mathematical games, Arguments

In combinatorial game theory, the strategy-stealing argument is a general argument that shows, for many two-player games, that the second player cannot have a winning strategy (i.e., a strategy that will always win the game for them, no matter what moves the first player makes).
The strategy-stealing argument applies to any symmetric game (one in which either player has the same set of available moves with the same results, so that the first player can "use" the second player's strategy) in which an extra move can never be a disadvantage. Examples of games to which the argument applies are hex, chomp and the m,n,k-games such as gomoku. In hex ties are not possible, so the argument shows that it is a first-player win.

The Speckled Wood (Pararge aegeria) is a butterfly found in and on the borders of woodland areas  throughout much of the Palearctic ecozone. The species is subdivided into multiple subspecies, including Pararge aegeria aegeria, Pararge aegeria tricis, Pararge aegeria oblita, and Pararge aegeria insula. The coloration of this butterfly varies between subspecies. The existence of these subspecies is due to variation in morphology down a gradient corresponding to a geographic cline. The background of the wings ranges from brown to orange, and the spots are either pale yellow, white, cream or a tawny orange. The Speckled Wood feeds on a variety of grass species. The males of this species exhibit two types of mate locating behaviors: territorial defense and patrolling. The proportion of males exhibiting these two strategies changes based on ecological conditions.  The monandrous female must choose which type of male can help her reproduce successfully. Her decision is heavily influenced by environmental conditions.

CATEGORIES: Representation theory, Clifford algebras

In mathematics, a Clifford module is a representation of a Clifford algebra. In general a Clifford algebra C is a central simple algebra over some field extension L of the field K over which the quadratic form Q defining C is defined.
The abstract theory of Clifford modules was founded by a paper of M. F. Atiyah, R. Bott and Arnold S. Shapiro. A fundamental result on Clifford modules is that the Morita equivalence class of a Clifford algebra (the equivalence class of the category of Clifford modules over it) depends only on the signature [tpl]nowrap|p − q (mod 8)[/tpl]. This is an algebraic form of Bott periodicity.

CATEGORIES: American comic strips, Comic strips started in the 1930s, Comics characters, Soap operas

Mary Worth is a newspaper comic strip, which has had a seven-decade run since it began in 1938 under the title Mary Worth's Family. Distributed by King Features Syndicate, this pioneering soap opera-style strip had an influence on several realistically drawn continuity strips that followed.  
Mary Worth evolved from Apple Mary, a successful comic strip created in 1932 by Martha Orr, about an elderly woman who sells apples around her neighborhood. The earlier Apple Mary was taken over and renamed by artist Dale Conner, who had previously been Martha Orr's assistant. Later, when Allen Saunders signed on as the scripter, the strip appeared under the pseudonym "Dale Allen", a combination of the collaborators' given names. The strip reached its apex under Saunders and artist Ken Ernst. The title was shortened in 1942 when Ernst succeeded Conner. It was also published briefly by Harvey Comics as Love Stories of Mary Worth (1949-50).

CATEGORIES: History of rail transport in the United Kingdom, Transport policy in the United Kingdom, 1993 in rail transport, 1993 in the United Kingdom, History of British Rail, Privatisation of British Rail

The privatisation of British Rail was set in motion when the Conservative government enacted, on 19 January 1993, the British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Act 1993. This enabled the relevant Secretary of State to issue directions (as to the disposal of holdings) to the relevant Board. This was necessary since (in the case of the British Railways Board) they had to act, at all times, within the rules established by various Transport and Railways Acts – none of which would have allowed the Board to 'sell-off' any of its assets. The subsequent direction from the Secretary of State forced the creation of Railtrack PLC. This then paved the way for the Railways Act 1993 introduced by John Major's Conservative government later that year. The operations of the British Railways Board (BRB) were broken up and sold off. This process was very controversial at the time, and the Labour opposition announced its intention to re-nationalise the railways, although this was not implemented by the subsequent Labour government. The manner in which privatisation was carried out has also received criticism for the number of companies involved (over 90), and its complexity.

[[Pulsed laser deposition]]
CATEGORIES: Semiconductor device fabrication, Thin film deposition, Laser machining, Laser applications

Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a thin film deposition (specifically a physical vapor deposition, PVD) technique where a high-power pulsed laser beam is focused inside a vacuum chamber to strike a target of the material that is to be deposited. This material is vaporized from the target (in a plasma plume) which deposits it as a thin film on a substrate (such as a silicon wafer facing the target). This process can occur in ultra high vacuum or in the presence of a background gas, such as oxygen which is commonly used when depositing oxides to fully oxygenate the deposited films.
While the basic-setup is simple relative to many other deposition techniques, the physical phenomena of laser-target interaction and film growth are quite complex (see Process below). When the laser pulse is absorbed by the target, energy is first converted to electronic excitation and then into thermal, chemical and mechanical energy resulting in evaporation, ablation, plasma formation and even exfoliation.Pulsed Laser Deposition of Thin Films, edited by Douglas B. Chrisey and Graham K. Hubler, John Wiley & Sons, 1994 ISBN 0-471-59218-8 The ejected species expand into the surrounding vacuum in the form of a plume containing many energetic species including atoms, molecules, electrons, ions, clusters, particulates and molten globules, before depositing on the typically hot substrate.

Anglo-Indians are people who have mixed Indian and British ancestry, or people of British descent born or living in the Indian Subcontinent or Burma, now mainly historical in the latter sense.Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Edition (1989)Anglo-Indian, Dictionary.com. British residents in India used the term "Eurasians" for people of mixed European and Indian descent (cf. George Orwell's Burmese Days). The Oxford Dictionary's definition of "Anglo-Indian" is "Of mixed British and Indian parentage, of Indian descent but born or living in Britain, or (chiefly historical) of British descent or birth but living or having lived long in India".[tpl]cite web|title=Anglo-Indian|work=Oxford Dictionary Online|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Anglo-Indian|accessdate=2012-01-30[/tpl]
The Anglo-Indian community in its modern sense is a distinct, small minority community originating in India.  It consists of people from mixed British and Indian ancestry whose native language is English. An Anglo-Indian's British ancestry was usually bequeathed paternally.
Article 366(2) of the Indian Constitution defines Anglo-Indian as:"Treaty Bodies Database – Document – State Party Report" United Nations Human Rights Website. April 29, 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/255331/ |title=Article 366(2) in The Constitution Of India 1949|accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl]
 (2) an Anglo Indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only; 
Anglo-Indian often only represents Indians mixed with British ancestry during the British Raj. There are many mixed Indians from European countries other than the British, that were involved in the British Raj, for example, the definition rarely embraces the descendants of the Indians from the old Portuguese colonies of both the Coromandel and Malabar Coasts, who joined the East India Company as mercenaries and brought their families with them.See Stark, op. cit. The definition has many extensions, for example, mestiços (mixed Portuguese and Indian) of Goa, people of Indo-French descent, and Indo-Dutch descent. Indians have encountered Europeans since their earliest civilization. They have been a continuous element in the sub-continent. Their presence is not be considered Anglo-Indian. Similarly, Indians who mixed with Europeans after the British Raj are also not be considered Anglo-Indian.Dover, Cedric. Cimmerii or Eurasians and Their Future: An Anglo Indian Heritage Book. London: Simon Wallenberg Press, 2007. Pages 62–63
Anglo-Indians formed a significant portion of the minority community in India during the British Raj. The Anglo-Indian population in India dwindled from roughly 800,000 in 1947 to fewer than 350,000 by 2010. Many have adapted to local communities and emigrated to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and United States.[tpl]cite news |title=Some corner of a foreign field |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17312300 |newspaper=The Economist |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2011-02-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110119140656/http://www.economist.com/node/17312300| archivedate= 19 January 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

[[Slip-cueing]]
CATEGORIES: DJing

Slip-cueing is a turntable-based DJ technique that consists of holding a record still while the platter rotates underneath the slipmat and releasing it at the right moment. This way the record accelerates to the right speed almost immediately, without waiting for the heavy platter to start up. Slip-cueing was introduced to the disco scene by Francis Grasso.
[tpl]cquote|Francis was the first DJ to perfect the current technique for stitching records together in seamless sequences.  He invented the trick of "slip-cueing"; Holding the disc with his thumb while the turntable whirled beneath insulated by a felt pad, he would locate with an earphone the best spot to make the splice, then release the next side precisely on the beat.  When he got Thorens turntables with speed controls, he supplemented his cuing technique with speed changes that enabled him to match up the records perfectly in tempo[/tpl] ~ Goldman 1978
While the technique of slip cueing had originated in the broadcast industry several years before, it was Francis Grasso who changed the style by releasing the next song on beat, creating a continuous flow of music for a nightclub dance floor.

Brenda Starr, Reporter (often referred to simply as Brenda Starr) is a comic strip about a glamorous, adventurous female reporter. It was created in 1940 by Dale Messick for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. 
Although set in Chicago, Brenda Starr, Reporter initially was the only Chicago Tribune Syndicate strip not to appear in the Chicago Tribune newspaper. When the strip debuted June 30, 1940, it was relegated to a comic book supplement that was included with the Sunday Chicago Tribune. Soon the strip appeared in the Sunday paper and a daily strip was added in 1945.[tpl]Cite web| last =Markstein| first = Donald D.| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Brenda Starr| work =| publisher =Toonopedia| date =| url = http://www.toonopedia.com/br_starr.htm| doi =| accessdate =12 December 2010[/tpl] During the 1950s, at the height of its popularity, the strip appeared in 250 newspapers. In 2010, the strip appeared in 65 newspapers with 36 being international papers.
Following Messick's retirement as Brenda Starr's artist in 1980, the strip was continued by different female writer and illustrator teams. From 1980 through 1982, Messick continued scripting, and the strip was illustrated by Ramona Fradon. In 1982, Linda Sutter took over writing. Mary Schmich began scripting the strip in 1985, with Fradon continuing as the illustrator until her 1995 retirement.

thumb|200px|right|The damage to the edge of this test acetate shows that the underlying material is aluminium, rather than the vinyl of a record sold at retail.An acetate disc, also known as a test acetate, dubplate (a term from Jamaican reggae culture, now also applied to individually recorded discs of solid plastic), lacquer (a technically correct term preferred by engineers in the recording industry), transcription disc (a special recording intended for, or made from, a radio broadcast) or instantaneous disc (because it can be played immediately after recording without any further processing), is a type of phonograph (gramophone) record, a mechanical sound storage medium, widely used from the 1930s to the late 1950s for recording and broadcast purposes and still in limited use today.
Unlike ordinary vinyl records, which are quickly formed from lumps of plastic by a mass-production molding process, a so-called acetate disc is created by using a recording lathe to cut an audio-signal-modulated groove into the surface of a special lacquer-coated blank disc, a real-time operation requiring expensive, delicate equipment and expert skill for good results. They are made for special purposes, almost never for sale to the general public. They can be played on any normal record player but will suffer from wear more quickly than vinyl. Some acetates are highly prized for their rarity, especially when they contain unpublished material.
Acetates are usually made by dubbing from a master recording in another medium, such as magnetic tape. In the vinyl record manufacturing process, an acetate master disc is cut and electroforming is used to make negative metal molds from it; each mold, known as a stamper, can be used to press thousands of vinyl copies of the master. Within the vinyl record industry, acetates are also used for evaluating the quality of the tape-to-disc transfer. They were once a favored medium for comparing different takes or mixes of a recording, and if pressed vinyl copies of an impending new release were not yet available, acetates were used for getting preview copies into the hands of important radio disc jockeys.

[[Latin hypercube sampling]]

CATEGORIES: Sampling techniques, Latin squares, Design of experiments

Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a statistical method for generating a sample of plausible collections of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. The sampling method is often used to construct computer experiments.
The LHS was described by McKay in 1979. An independently equivalent technique has been proposed by Eglājs in 1977.[tpl]cite journal|last=Eglajs|first=V.|coauthors=Audze P.|title=New approach to the design of multifactor experiments|journal=Problems of Dynamics and Strengths|year=1977|series=35|pages=104–107|publisher=Zinatne Publishing House|location=Riga|language=Russian[/tpl]   It was further elaborated by Ronald L. Iman, and others[tpl]cite journal |last=Iman |first=R.L. |coauthors=Helton, J.C.; and Campbell, J.E. |title=An approach to sensitivity analysis of computer models, Part 1. Introduction, input variable selection and preliminary variable assessment |journal=Journal of Quality Technology |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=174–183  |year=1981 [/tpl] in 1981. Detailed computer codes and manuals were later published.[tpl]cite book |last=Iman |first=R.L. |coauthors=Davenport, J.M. ; Zeigler, D.K. |title=Latin hypercube sampling (program user's guide) |year=1980 |osti=5571631[/tpl]
In the context of statistical sampling, a square grid containing sample positions is a Latin square if (and only if) there is only one sample in each row and each column. A Latin hypercube is the generalisation of this concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions, whereby each sample is the only one in each axis-aligned hyperplane containing it.
Orthogonal sampling adds the requirement that the entire sample space must be sampled evenly. Although more efficient, orthogonal sampling strategy is more difficult to implement since all random samples must be generated simultaneously.
In two dimensions the difference between random sampling, Latin Hypercube sampling and orthogonal sampling can be explained as follows:
Thus, orthogonal sampling ensures that the ensemble of random numbers is a very good representative of the real variability, LHS ensures that the ensemble of random numbers is representative of the real variability whereas traditional random sampling (sometimes called brute force) is just an ensemble of random numbers without any guarantees.

[[Cognitive distortion]]

CATEGORIES: Cognition, Cognitive therapy, Defence mechanisms, Cognitive biases, Narcissism, Deception

Cognitive distortions are exaggerated or irrational thought patterns that are believed to perpetuate the effects of psychopathological states, especially depression and anxiety. Psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck laid the groundwork for the study of these distortions, and his student David D. Burns continued research on the topic. Most notably, Burns’ 1989 book, The Feeling Good Handbook[tpl]cite book |last=Burns |first=David D. |title=The Feeling Good Handbook: Using the New Mood Therapy in Everyday Life |location=New York |publisher=W. Morrow |year=1989 |isbn=0688017452 [/tpl]  presented information on these thought patterns along with a proposal of how to eliminate them.
Moreover, cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality negatively. These negative thinking patterns are simply convincing the mind of individuals that what they see is true when it is not. They are inaccurate thoughts that usually reinforce negative thoughts or emotions. [tpl]cite web|last=Grohol|first=John|title=15 Common Cognitive Distortions|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/0002153|publisher=PsychCentral|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] Cognitive distortions tend to interfere with the way a person perceives an event.  Since the way a person feels intervenes with how they think, these distorted thoughts feed their negative emotions. As a result, an individual affected by cognitive distortions may have an overall negative outlook on the world.

[[Bridge circuit]]
CATEGORIES: Electrical circuits

A bridge circuit is a type of electrical circuit in which two circuit branches (usually in parallel with each other) are "bridged" by a third branch connected between the first two branches at some intermediate point along them.  The bridge was originally developed for laboratory measurement purposes and one of the intermediate bridging points is often adjustable when so used.  Bridge circuits now find many applications, both linear and non-linear, including in instrumentation, filtering and power conversion.Bureau of Naval Personnel, Basic Electricity, p.114, Courier Dover Publications, 1970 ISBN 0-486-20973-3.[ref]
Clarence W. De Silva, Vibration monitoring, testing, and instrumentation, pp.2.43-2.49, CRC Press, 2007 ISBN 1-4200-5319-1[/ref]
The best-known bridge circuit, the Wheatstone bridge, was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie and popularized by Charles Wheatstone, and is used for measuring resistance. It is constructed from four resistors, two of known values R1 and R3 (see diagram), one whose resistance is to be determined Rx, and one which is variable and calibrated R2.  Two opposite vertices are connected to a source of electric current, such as a battery, and a galvanometer is connected across the other two vertices. The variable resistor is adjusted until the galvanometer reads zero.  It is then known that the ratio between the variable resistor and its neighbour R1 is equal to the ratio between the unknown resistor and its neighbour R3, which enables the value of the unknown resistor to be calculated.
The Wheatstone bridge has also been generalised to measure impedance in AC circuits, and to measure resistance, inductance, capacitance, and dissipation factor separately. Various arrangements are known as the Wien bridge, Maxwell bridge and Heaviside bridge.All about circuits: AC bridge circuits  All are based on the same principle, which is to compare the output of two potentiometers sharing a common source.
In power supply design, a bridge circuit or bridge rectifier is an arrangement of diodes or similar devices used to rectify an electric current, i.e. to convert it from an unknown or alternating polarity to a direct current of known polarity.
In some motor controllers, a H-bridge is used to control the direction the motor turns.

The industry was probably created by modern humans (Homo sapiens), albeit of an early type, as shown by the few skeletal remains known so far from sites on the Moroccan Atlantic coast extending to Egypt.
Bifacially-worked, leaf-shaped and tanged projectile points are a common artefact type and so are racloirs and Levallois flakes.  Items of personal adornment (pierced and ochred Nassarius shell beads) are known from at least one Aterian site, with an age of 82,000 years.

[[Mechanochemistry]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Mechanochemistry or mechanical chemistry is the coupling of mechanical and chemical phenomena on a molecular scale and includes mechanical breakage, chemical behaviour of mechanically-stressed solids (e.g., stress-corrosion cracking), tribology, polymer degradation under shear, cavitation-related phenomena (e.g., sonochemistry and sonoluminescence), shock wave chemistry and physics, and even the burgeoning field of molecular machines.  Mechanochemistry can be seen as an interface between chemistry and mechanical engineering. It is possible to synthesize chemical products by using only mechanical action. The mechanisms of mechanochemical transformations are often complex and different from usual thermal or photochemical mechanisms.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Charles R. |last1=Hickenboth |first2=Jeffrey S. |last2=Moore |first3=Scott R. |last3=White |first4=Nancy R. |last4=Sottos |first5=Jerome |last5=Baudry1 |first6=Scott R. |last6=Wilson |year=2007 |title=Biasing Reaction Pathways with Mechanical Force, |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue= 7134|pages=423–427 |publisher= |doi=10.1038/nature05681 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7134/full/nature05681.html |accessdate=20 June 2013 |pmid=17377579[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl]Carlier L. & al. , Greener pharmacy using solvent-free synthesis: investigation of the mechanism in the case of dibenzophenazine, Powder Technol. 2013,  240, 41-47.

Mechanochemical phenomena have been utilized since time immemorial, for example in making fire.  The oldest method of making fire is to rub pieces of wood against each other, creating friction and hence heat, allowing the wood to undergo combustion at a high temperature.  Another method involves the use of flint and steel, during which a spark (a small particle of pyrophoric metal) spontaneously combusts in air, starting fire instantaneously.

[[Abortion in the Netherlands]]

CATEGORIES: Abortion in the Netherlands, Dutch law

[tpl]Refimprove|date=March 2012[/tpl]Abortion in the Netherlands was ratified by Parliament in April 1981 and came into effect from November 1, 1984 onwards. The Netherlands has a "Abortion is illegal, unless ..."-system. The law, Wet  afbreking  zwangerschap or Wafz doesn't mention a time until when abortions are legal. However, criminal law is very clear that abortions are illegal if there's a "reasonable expectation" of viability. In practice, this means that the abortion doctor is culpable after 24 weeks.http://www.st-ab.nl/wetten/0383_Wet_afbreking_zwangerschap_Wafz.htm Another restriction is that only the bigger hospitals are allowed to perform abortions after the 12th week, smaller clinics can do it before the 12th week.
Both have to be licensed by the government.
Cases which involve urgent medical attention or rape aren't mentioned by law. This means these cases fall under general law, which means that if the life of the mother is at risk, abortions are legal, meaning that the doctor will not be prosecuted. http://www.wetboek-online.nl/wet/Wetboek%20van%20Strafrecht/296.html There is a five-day waiting period for abortions. The pregnant woman must indicate that there's an "emergency situation" as a reason for the abortion. The law deliberately doesn't mention what can be deemed an emergency situation because it can be different for anybody, but the following emergency situations are usual: incapability of care, too young or family is complete. It's likely that rape would be deemed an emergency situation.

[[File:Global_Wave_Height_Speed.jpg|thumb| The image shows the global distribution of wind speed and wave height as observed by NASA's TOPEX/Poseidon's dual-frequency radar altimeter from October 3 to October 12, 1992. Simultaneous observations of wind speed and wave height are helping scientists to predict ocean waves . Wind speed is determined by the strength of the radar signal after it has bounced off the ocean surface and returned to the satellite. A calm sea serves as a good reflector and returns a strong signal; a rough sea tends to scatter the signals and returns a weak pulse. Wave height is determined by the shape of the return radar pulse.
A calm sea with low waves returns a condensed pulse whereas a rough sea with high waves returns a stretched pulse. Comparing the two images above shows a high degree of correlation between wind speed and wave height. The strongest winds (over 54 kilometers per hour or 33.6 miles per hour) and highest waves are found in the Southern Ocean. The weakest winds -- shown as areas of magenta and dark blue -- are generally found in the tropical Oceans.]]
In fluid dynamics, wind waves or, more precisely, wind-generated waves are surface waves that occur on the free surface of oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, and canals or even on small puddles and ponds. They usually result from the wind blowing over a vast enough stretch of fluid surface.  Waves in the oceans can travel thousands of miles before reaching land. Wind waves range in size from small ripples to huge waves over 30 m high.[tpl]citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | location=Howard University, US, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publiations | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood | publication-date=23 June 2010 | isbn=978-981-4304-23-8[/tpl]
When directly generated and affected by local winds, a wind wave system is called a wind sea. After the wind ceases to blow, wind waves are called swells. More generally, a swell consists of wind-generated waves that are not—or are hardly—affected by the local wind at that time. They have been generated elsewhere or some time ago.Holthuijsen (2007), page 5. Wind waves in the ocean are called ocean surface waves.
Wind waves have a certain amount of randomness: subsequent waves differ in height, duration, and shape with limited predictability. They can be described as a stochastic process, in combination with the physics governing their generation, growth, propagation and decay—as well as governing the interdependence between flow quantities such as: the water surface movements, flow velocities and water pressure. The key statistics of wind waves (both seas and swells) in evolving sea states can be predicted with wind wave models.
Tsunamis are a specific type of wave not caused by wind but by geological effects. In deep water, tsunamis are not visible because they are small in height and very long in wavelength.  They may grow to devastating proportions at the coast due to reduced water depth.
Although waves are usually considered in the water seas of Earth, the hydrocarbon seas of Titan may also have wind-driven waves.   Lorenz, R. D. and A. G. Hayes, The Growth of Wind-Waves in Titan's Hydrocarbon Seas, Icarus, 219, 468–475, 2012

The formal, official name of the committee was the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities.Senate Historical Minutes: Watergate Leaks Lead to Open Hearings.  United States Senate Historical Office.
The Committee played a pivotal role in gathering evidence that would lead to the indictment of forty administration officials and the conviction of several of Nixon's aides for obstruction of justice and other crimes.  Its revelations prompted the introduction of articles of impeachment against the President in the House of Representatives, which led to Nixon's resignation.

Adrian "Addie" Joss (April 12, 1880 – April 14, 1911), nicknamed "The Human Hairpin,"Hall of Fame Pitchers at America's Library/The Library of Congress was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He pitched for the Cleveland Bronchos, later known as the Naps, between 1902 and 1910. Joss, who was [tpl]convert|6|ft|3|in|m[/tpl] and weighed [tpl]convert|185|lb|kg[/tpl], pitched the fourth perfect game in baseball history. His 1.89 career earned run average (ERA) is the second-lowest in MLB history.
Joss was born and raised in Wisconsin, where he attended St. Mary's College and the University of Wisconsin. He played baseball at St. Mary's and then played in a semipro league where he caught the attention of Connie Mack. Joss did not sign with Mack's team, but he attracted further major league interest after winning 19 games in 1900 for the Toledo Mud Hens. Joss had another strong season for Toledo in 1901. 
After an offseason contract dispute between Joss, Toledo and Cleveland, he debuted with the Cleveland club in April 1902. Joss led the league in shutouts that year. By 1905, Joss had completed the first of his four consecutive 20-win seasons. Off the field, Joss worked as a newspaper sportswriter from 1906 until his death. In 1908, he pitched a perfect game during a tight pennant race that saw Cleveland finish a half-game out of first place; it was the closest that Joss came to a World Series berth. The 1910 season was his last, and Joss missed most of the year due to injury. 
In April 1911, Joss became ill and he died the same month due to tuberculous meningitis. He finished his career with 160 wins, 234 complete games, 45 shutouts and 920 strikeouts. Though Joss played only nine seasons and missed significant playing time due to various ailments, the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Board of Directors passed a special resolution for Joss in 1977 which waived the typical ten-year minimum playing career for Hall of Fame eligibility.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oXpQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5REEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5194,5082608&dq=addie+joss+hall+of+fame&hl=en|title=Fame Beckons Joss, MacPhail|page=2|date=31 January 1978|agency=United Press International[/tpl] He was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1978.

[[Bounded complete poset]]
CATEGORIES: Order theory

In the mathematical field of order theory, a partially ordered set is bounded complete if all of its subsets which have some upper bound also have a least upper bound. Such a partial order can also be called consistently or coherently complete (Visser 2004, p. 182), since any upper bound of a set can be interpreted as some consistent (non-contradictory) piece of information that extends all the information present in the set. Hence the presence of some upper bound in a way guarantees the consistence of a set. Bounded completeness then yields the existence of a least upper bound of any "consistent" subset, which can be regarded as the most general piece of information that captures all the knowledge present within this subset. This view closely relates to the idea of information ordering that one typically finds in domain theory. 
Formally, a partially ordered set (P, ≤) is bounded complete if the following holds for any subset S of P:
Bounded completeness has various relationships to other completeness properties, which are detailed in the article on completeness in order theory. Note also that the term bounded poset is sometimes used to refer to a partially ordered set which has both a least and a greatest element. Hence it is important to distinguish between a bounded complete poset and a bounded complete partial order (cpo).
For a typical example of a bounded complete poset, consider the set of all finite decimal numbers starting with "0." (like 0.1, 0.234, 0.122) together with all infinite such numbers (like the decimal representation 0.1111... of 1/9). Now these elements can be ordered based on the prefix order of words: a decimal number n is below some other number m if there is some string of digits w such that nw = m. For example, 0.2 is below 0.234, since one can obtain the latter by appending the string "34" to 0.2. The infinite decimal numbers are the maximal elements within this order. In general, subsets of this order do not have least upper bounds: just consider the set {0.1, 0.3}. Looking back at the above intuition, one might say that it is not consistent to assume that some number is starting both with 0.1 and with 0.3. However, the order is still bounded complete. In fact, it is even an example of a more specialized class of structures, the Scott domains, which provide many other examples for bounded complete posets.

Eugénie Grandet is an 1833 novel by Honoré de Balzac about miserliness, and how it is bequeathed from the father to the daughter, Eugénie, through her unsatisfying love attachment with her cousin. As is usual with Balzac, all the characters in the novel are fully realized. Balzac conceived his ambitious project, The Human Comedy, while writing Eugénie Grandet and incorporated it into the Comédie by revising the names of some of the characters in the second edition, which he also dedicated to Maria Du Fresnay, his then-lover and mother of his daughter, and, as was proved later on, the "real" Eugénie Grandet.

[[List of former Nazi Party members]]
CATEGORIES: Nazis, Lists of people by ideology, Nazi Germany, Nazi-related lists

The list of notable people who were at some point members of the Nazi Party, before it was declared illegal and disbanded upon the victory of the Allies. After 1945 many former party members had to go through a process of denazification and some were indicted and convicted at the Nuremberg Trials, or other trials, notably for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Many others evaded capture or managed to escape, in particular with the help of the ODESSA organization. In the mid-1950s, most people convicted during these trials were given amnesty and subsequently released.
Some former party members managed to obtain very important positions in West Germany after the war (e.g. Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Chancellor of West Germany from 1966 to 1969), others were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency after the war as part of the Gehlen Organization, predecessor of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). In East Germany, the Stasi, the GDR's intelligence service, was alleged to have employed several chief informers and agents who were former SS and Gestapo operatives.Book Claims Stasi Employed Nazis as Spies, ''Deutsche Welle, 31.10.2005

It was one of the oldest agricultural communities in the world, dating back to 7090 BCE. Jarmo is broadly contemporary with such other important Neolithic sites such as Jericho in the southern Levant and Çatal Hüyük in Anatolia. The site of Jarmo is approximately three to four acres (12,000 to 16,000 m²) in size and lies at an altitude of 800 meters above sea level in a belt of oak and pistachio woodlands.

[[Force-directed graph drawing]]

CATEGORIES: Graph algorithms, Graph drawing, Articles with example pseudocode

Force-directed graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically pleasing way. Their purpose is to position the nodes of a graph in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible, by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes, based on their relative positions, and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy.[tpl]citation|first=Stephen G.|last=Kobourov|title=Spring Embedders and Force-Directed Graph Drawing Algorithms|year=2012|arxiv=1201.3011[/tpl].
While graph drawing can be a difficult problem, force-directed algorithms, being physical simulations, usually require no special knowledge about graph theory such as planarity.

[[All-Australian team]]
CATEGORIES: Australian Football League awards, Australian rules football awards

The All-Australian Team is an all star team of Australian rules footballers, selected by a panel at the end of each season. It represents a complete team, including interchange players and a coach, of the best performed during the season.
As no other country could assemble a senior Australian rules team of the same quality, the All-Australian team never plays a game. From 1998-2004, the Australian international rules team was mainly composed of All-Australians, though from 2005-2013 the team for the annual International Rules Series was selected according to the quite different requirements of International rules football. This change was reverted ahead of the 2014 series, with only players who have been selected at least once in any All-Australian team being eligible for selection. 
Sporting Life magazine invented the concept of an All-Australian Team in 1947. A squad was selected from players in various leagues in October each year by a panel chosen by the magazine. In 1953, immediately after the Australian Football Carnival, which was held in Adelaide on that occasion, an official All-Australian team was selected by representatives of the various state and territorial teams. This tradition continued until the 1988 carnival.
Concurrently, from 1982, the Victorian Football League (VFL) began to announce its own team of the year. In 1991, following the VFL's conversion to a national competition and its renaming as the Australian Football League (AFL), the two concepts were merged.
Since 1999, the All-Australian coach is the coach of the premiership-winning side that year.
On 5 June 2007 the AFL announced that it will alter the format of the announcement of the All-Australian team in the future. Ongoing from 2007 the All-Australian selection committee will provide the 40 leading players of the year in their playing positions at the conclusion of the home and away season before announcing the final 22 at a later date during the All Australian Presentation Dinner. Of the 40 leading players for that year provided the leading 12 defenders will be nominated with six to be chosen in the final team, the leading 12 forwards will be nominated with six to be chosen in the final team, and the leading 16 ruckmen and midfielders will be nominated with six to be chosen in the final team.

Stenshuvud is a hill in the southeastern corner of Sweden, in the province of Skåne, close to Kivik in Simrishamn Municipality. Since 1986, it is one of the National parks of Sweden. The park covers an area of about 3.9 km². 
The hill is 97 metres high and faces the Baltic Sea. Since the surrounding landscape is relatively flat, it can be seen from a great distance and has traditionally been used as a landmark for seafarers. Many visitors trek up the hill to enjoy the view which is very good in clear weather.
Most of the area is covered with broadleaf forest, especially European hornbeam.  The park also contains heaths, meadows and swamps. Because of the mild climate and varied habitats, many different animal and plant species can be encountered in the park. The park contains unusual Swedish wildlife such as the hazel dormouse, golden oriole, European tree frog and agile frog. There are about 600 vascular plant species, including several types of orchids and the very rare barren strawberry.
Below the hill there is a popular swimming beach. Close to the top one can find the remains of a ruin of a 5th- or 6th-century fortress. 
According to local folklore, the hill got its name (Sten's head) from a giant living in the cave Giddastuan. 
At the north of the hill you will find the arboretum of Hällevik

The Sutherland Shire is a local government area in the southern region of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.
Geographically, it is the area to the south of Botany Bay and the Georges River. The administrative centre of the local government is located in the suburb of Sutherland, with council chambers located in Eton Street. Within the Shire is the birthplace of modern Australia, as it was the first landing site of Captain James Cook, who went ashore onto what is now the suburb of Kurnell on 29 April 1770. It was originally intended to be the site of the first British Settlement, before Sydney Cove was chosen as the location during the First Fleet.http://www.sutherland.nsw.gov.au/ssc/home.nsf/Web+Pages/968960D9346BADD3CA256D56001BAC2A?OpenDocument[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] The Sutherland Shire is [tpl]convert|26|km[/tpl] south of Sydney central business district, and is bordered by Bankstown, Wollongong, Liverpool, Hurstville and Campbelltown local government areas.

[[Polydrafter]]

CATEGORIES: Polyforms

In recreational mathematics, a polydrafter is a polyform with a 30°–60°–90° right triangle as the base form. This triangle is also called a drafting triangle, hence the name.[ref]
.</ref> This triangle is also half of an [[equilateral triangle]], and a polydrafter's cells must consist of halves of triangles in the [[triangular tiling]] of the plane; equivalently, when two drafters share an edge that is the middle of their three edge lengths, they must be reflections rather than rotations of each other. Any contiguous subset of halves of triangles in this tiling is allowed, so unlike most polyforms, a polydrafter may have cells joined along unequal edges: a hypotenuse and a short leg.
Polydrafters were invented by Christopher Monckton, who used the name polydudes for polydrafters that have no cells attached only by the length of a short leg.  Monckton's Eternity Puzzle was composed of 209 12-dudes.[tpl]citation|title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics|first=Clifford A.|last=Pickover|authorlink=Clifford A.

The term polydrafter was coined by Ed Pegg, Jr., who also proposed as a puzzle the task of fitting the 14 tridrafters—all possible clusters of three drafters—into a trapezoid whose sides are 2, 3, 2, and 5 times the length of the hypotenuse of a drafter.[tpl]citation|contribution=Polyform puzzles|first=Ed, Jr.|last=Pegg|authorlink=Ed Pegg, Jr.|pages=119–125|title=Tribute to a Mathemagician|editor1-first=Barry|editor1-last=Cipra|editor2-first=Erik D.|editor2-last=Demaine|editor2-link=Erik Demaine|editor3-first=Martin L.|editor3-last=Demaine|editor3-link=Martin Demaine|editor4-first=Tom|editor4-last=Rodgers|publisher=A K Peters|year=2005[/tpl].

[[Holly Lodge Estate]]
CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Camden, Housing in London

The Holly Lodge Estate is an estate located on the site and grounds of a villa built in 1798 by Sir Henry Tempest on the south-facing slopes of Highgate, London adjacent to Highgate Rise, now known as Highgate West Hill. The estate lands included Traitor's Hill, reputedly where members of the gunpowder plot had met to watch the Palace of Westminster blow up although since known to be false. This villa was later to be known as The Holly Lodge and in 1809 a young actress, Harriot Mellon, took over the lease on the property. She married the banker Thomas Coutts in 1815 and enlarged the house and grounds by buying adjacent properties. The grounds were landscaped by John Buonarotti Papworth in 1825. When Harriot Mellon died in 1837 she left the house and her fortune to Mr Coutts' granddaughter, Angela Burdett.
Between 1849 and 1906 Holly Lodge became world famous as the rural retreat of one of the most remarkable women of the 19th century with grand galas and festivities taking place in the house and the meadows. Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens were both regular visitors to the estate.
Angela Burdett-Coutts had married in 1881 and after her death her husband put the property on the market. Being four miles (6 km) from the City it failed to sell and in 1907 was put on the market again, divided into several lots. It still failed to sell and it was not until 1922, after the death of her husband, that even outlying parts of the estate were sold: South Grove House and Holly Terrace to the North (the latter mostly unchanged in appearance since then) and Brookfield Stud to the south (now replaced by housing). Eventually, in March 1923, the remainder of the estate, advertised as and subsequently always referred to as the Holly Lodge Estate, was sold for £45,000 and resold at the same price later that year to London Garden Suburbs Limited with the building of the first road of houses, on Bromwich Avenue, being started by the Central London Building Company Limited later that same year. The former 'lodge' was demolished during the building of the new roads of houses and no trace of the building now remains, apart from a plaque at the entrance to the gardens taken from the north wall.
Initially, the plan was to build houses on the entire estate, creating a new housing estate, but due to slow sales and the need for drainage from the higher ground the land to the east of the new central road was instead acquired by the Lady Workers' Homes Limited to build blocks of rooms for single women moving to London in order to work as secretaries and clerks in the city on the Eastern side of the estate. The local Alderman and others involved in the project are commemorated in an inscription on the ornamental pond in the central garden area. Built as an early gated community the estate currently has two main access roads. The upper one to Highgate West Hill closing every night until mid-morning, the lower one to Swains Lane being closed randomly with access then controlled by estate staff. This maintains the private status of the estate roads and stops a right of way being created.
Langbourne Mansions was built first and provided 88 self-contained flats which have changed little in the intervening years. The mansion blocks on Makepeace Avenue and Oakeshott Avenue though were designed from the outset as bed-sitting rooms, sometimes with bedroom or kitchen alcoves, and offered an acceptable way for single women to live near to London on their own. Only three flats in the whole of Makepeace Mansions and Holly Lodge Mansions had their own bathroom (one for a particular tenant, one for the caretaker and the remaining one for the stoker for the central boiler). The remainder all had shared bathroom and toilet facilities, which is still the case for seven of the blocks even today. Makepeace Mansions originally provided 269 rooms and Holly Lodge Mansions on Oakeshott Avenue had 408 flats but later conversions have seen this number reduced as bedsits have given way to self-contained flats. New regulations have seen a start on the conversion of the remaining bedsits to self-contained accommodation during 2005.
The design of the mansion blocks on each avenue follow the same design concept with variations from group to group. From a distance they appear as 'Tudor Cliffs' as they tower above the adjoining houses and which is aided by the topography with not only the fall of the hill to the south but also to the east adjoining Highgate Cemetery.
The blocks are four of five stories in height and are united by timber details, gable roofs with finials, red tiles and casement windows usually with south-facing balconies. The rear and side elevations are in a very different plain and minimal style and overall reflect the modern design of the 1920s rather than the use of the vernacular.
Ownership of the mansion blocks was transferred a number of times and, by the early 1960s under the ownership of Peachey Properties, many of the blocks were in a state of disrepair. The Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras took them over on a 150-year lease in 1964 which devolved to the London Borough of Camden the following year. Whilst Camden looks after the mansion blocks and the gardens in between the blocks, the remainder of the estate is managed and maintained by the Holly Lodge Estate Committee. The whole area remains a private estate and has been a Conservation Area since June 1992. Between 2004 and 2006 Sprunt Architects were responsible for a comprehensive programme of refurbishment works with the residents in occupation in which the exteriors of all the mansion blocks were renovated.
As the bedsitting rooms and flats in the Makepeace Avenue and Oakeshott Avenue mansion blocks were built without kitchens a block was built at 30 Makepeace Avenue to serve as a centre for the community and included a restaurant, reading and meeting rooms and a small theatre. Behind it were three lawn tennis courts (with another two below Langbourne Avenue) where annual tennis tournaments were held. 
Towards the late 1950s this community block fell into decline and by the time Camden bought their lease on the mansion blocks it was derelict. After a Lands Tribunal the block with its unique facilities was sadly demolished and a new building with 25 one-person flats for the elderly, together with some communal facilities, was constructed on the site. Minutes of the Council at the time state that the community facilities would be replaced in the new building, however this failed to materialise and only a small community centre on the ground floor now serves the estate.
For many years Camden retained the policy of only placing women on the estate but that has since lapsed. The only known other estate built for single women was in Wandsworth but has since been demolished.

[[Abortion in Australia]]
CATEGORIES: Abortion in Australia, Australian law

Abortion in Australia is a subject of state law rather than national law. The grounds on which abortion is permitted in Australia vary from state to state. In every state, abortion is legal to protect the life and health of the woman, though each state has a different definition.
There is no law anywhere in Australia that requires the notification or consent of a woman's sexual partner. There is also no enforced waiting period for an abortion. Except in Western Australia, a minor does not require parental consent or notification.

The Roman Republic ([tpl]Lang-it|Repubblica Romana[/tpl]) was proclaimed on 15 February  1798 after Louis Alexandre Berthier, a general of Napoleon, had invaded the city of Rome on 10 February. The Roman Republic was a client republic under the French Directory composed of territory conquered from the Papal States. Pope Pius VI was exiled to France and died there in 1799. It immediately took the control of the other two former-papal revolutionary administrations, the Tiberina Republic and the Republic of Ancona. The Roman Republic was short-lived, as the Papal States were restored in October 1799.

[[Scott domain]]

CATEGORIES: Domain theory, Order theory

In the mathematical fields of order and domain theory, a Scott domain is an algebraic, bounded complete cpo. It has been named in honour of Dana S. Scott, who was the first to study these structures at the advent of domain theory. Scott domains are very closely related to algebraic lattices, being different only in possibly lacking a greatest element. They are also closely related to Scott information systems, which constitute a "syntactic" representation of Scott domains.
While the term "Scott domain" is widely used with the above definition, the term "domain" does not have such a generally accepted meaning and different authors will use different definitions; Scott himself used "domain" for the structures now called "Scott domains". Additionally, Scott domains appear with other names like "algebraic semilattice" in some publications.

Sir Frederick Vernon Corfield, QC, PC (1 June 1915 – August 25, 2005) was a British Conservative politician and minister.
Corfield was the son of Brigadier Frederick Alleyne Corfield and Mary Graham Vernon. On 10 August 1945 he married Elizabeth Mary Ruth Taylor at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton in London.Burkes Landed Gentry
He was educated firstly at Brockhurst Preparatory School The Corfields: A history of the Corfields from 1180 to the present day. ISBN 0-646-14333-6 and then at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military Academy. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1935. He was then posted to India until 1939, only to be sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force. By 1940 he was serving in the 51st (Highland) Division, and mentioned in dispatches, but, as the Germans advanced, the division was cut off and forced to surrender. Thus Corfield spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war, latterly at Oflag IX A/Z at Rotenburg an der Fulda. During his time as a prisoner he studied law.Guardian newspaper obituary.
On his return to England he qualified as a lawyer and was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1946, he spent a year in the army's judge advocate general's branch. This did not suit him. He spent the next decade mainly as a farmer, first on the family farm in Oxfordshire, then on a [tpl]convert|300|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] farm in Gloucestershire.
In 1955 he became MP for South Gloucestershire.
Shortly after becoming an MP he launched a private member's bill to improve compensation for compulsory land purchases. He received a second reading for his bill in February 1958, against government advice, and its general principles were incorporated in the town and country planning act of 1959.
Under Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home he held the position of Joint Parliamentary Secretary of Housing and Local Government (1962-4). He became an opposition spokesman on land and natural resources 1964-65 and subsequently an executive member of the 1922 Committee.  He became secretary of the Conservative MPs' agriculture committee (1956–62), and chairman of its small farms subcommittee (1957–58). He also became parliamentary private secretary to Airey Neave 
In 1970 Corfield was briefly Minister of State at the newly formed Department of Trade and Industry under John Davies. He subsequently held the positions of Minister for Aviation Supply and Aerospace Minister (1970-2) where he was responsible for the cancellation of the Black Arrow rocketry programme but provided financial assistance to Rolls-Royce (whose Filton, Bristol factory was within his constituency) when it ran into difficulties that hampered its defence commitments. This help included the nationalisation of the strategically significant aero-engine part of RR. He also presided over the first full scale roll-out of Concorde.
He returned to the backbenches in 1972 and did not contest his Gloucestershire seat in the general election of February 1974. After this retirement from the Commons he returned to legal pursuits and took seats on the boards of various water companies.

[[National Football League draft]]

CATEGORIES: National Football League Draft

The National Football League Draft, also called the player selection meeting, is an annual event in which the National Football League (NFL) teams select eligible college football players. It serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. The basic design of the draft is that each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, i.e., the last place team gets positioned first. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. After each team has utilized its position in the drafting order, whether by trading it or selecting a player, a round would be complete. Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936, but the fundamental methodology has remained the same. Currently the draft consists of seven rounds.  The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, have chosen the best player available.
In the early years of the draft, players were chosen based on hearsay, print media, or other rudimentary evidence of a player's ability. In the 1940s, some franchises began employing full-time scouts. The ensuing success of their corresponding teams eventually forced the other franchises to also hire scouts.
Colloquially, the name of the draft each year takes on the form of the NFL season in which players picked could begin playing. For example, the 2010 NFL draft was for the 2010 NFL season. However, the NFL-defined name of the process has changed since its inception.
The location of the draft has continually changed over the years to accommodate more fans, as the event has gained in popularity. The draft's popularity now garners prime-time television coverage.

It is thought that the town grew up around St Mary's Augustinian Friary (popularly referred to as "the Abbey"), which was founded in 1348, according to local tradition. The town and the surrounding hinterland is steeped in history and contains an extraordinary concentration of megalithic monuments.A Very Short History of Ballyhaunis and District Annagh Magazine, 2008. Local writer Paul Waldron explains that the full meaning of the name Béal Átha hAmhnais remains elusive: "The origins of that name has been the subject of much study and debate over the centuries. Beal Átha means the ford mouth, but what the last element means is still the subject of debate. Suggestions range from derivatives of 'Abhann', meaning river, or of 'amhnas', said to mean 'strife' or 'plunder'."
The town is a mixed community where farming, private business and industry are the main sources of employment. Employment, infrastructure and continued development of the town are key issues addressed by the Ballyhaunis Local Area Plan 2010-2016, adopted by Mayo County Council on 8 February 2010.Ballyhaunis Local Area Plan 2010–2016 Mayo County Council, 2010-02-08.
It has become a cosmopolitan area in recent decades. Even prior to Ireland's period of economic growth between 1995 and 2007, there were children of at least seven nationalities attending schools in the town. These included Pakistani, Syrian, Russian, English, Polish and Lithuanian. More recently, other nationalities have been attracted to Ballyhaunis, with immigrants from several countries in Africa and Eastern Europe now settled in the area. There are two Catholic churches in the town and it is also home to Ireland's only purpose-built mosque outside Dublin, which is the second most westerly mosque in Europe, after the Lisbon Mosque.[tpl]cite web | title=Lisbon Mosque | work=Wikipedia - Lisbon Mosque | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon_Mosque | accessdate=2007-09-06[/tpl] The results of the 2006 census showed that some 36 per cent of Ballyhaunis residents are non-Irish.

While there are only 20 elderly native speakers of Washo, since 1994 there has been a small immersion school that has produced a number of moderately fluent younger speakers. The immersion school has since closed its doors and the language program now operates through the Cultural Resource Department for the Washoe Tribe. The language is still very much endangered; however, there has been a renaissance in the language revitalization movement as many of the students who attended the original immersion school have become teachers.
Ethnographic Washo speakers belonged to the Great Basin culture area and they were the only non-Numic group of that area.d'Azevedo 1986 The language has borrowed from the neighboring Uto-Aztecan, Maiduan and Miwokan languages and is connected to both the Great Basin and California sprachbunds.

CATEGORIES: Source code, Naming conventions

The Leszynski naming convention (or LNC) is a variant of Hungarian notation popularized by consultant Stan Leszynski specifically for use with Microsoft Access development.Naming Conventions for Microsoft Access (Archived Microsoft Access Content) Although the naming convention is nowadays often used within the Microsoft Access community, and is standard in Visual Basic programming, it is not widely used elsewhere.
The conventions are derived from an earlier set of conventions, the Leszynski/Reddick naming conventions, originally developed in 1992 by Greg Reddick. Eventually, Leszynski and Reddick had different ideas about how the conventions should be developed, and split into two separate sets of conventions, the other being the RVBA Conventions.
As in all Hungarian notations, it uses prefixes (called tags) to indicate the type of objects and database development fields. 
The general structure of Hungarian notation (named after Charles Simonyi's native country) is to break down object names into the following elements:
The tags are always lower-case and each word of the object name is capitalized. Spaces and underscores are not used.

For Human Rights in United Latvia ([tpl]lang-lv|Par cilvēka tiesībām vienotā Latvijā[/tpl], PCTVL; [tpl]lang-ru|За права человека в единой Латвии[/tpl], ЗаПЧЕЛ) is a left-wing political party in Latvia, supported mainly by ethnic Russians and other ethnic minorities. Co-chairpersons of its Ruling Board are Tatjana Ždanoka, Jakovs Pliners and Miroslav Mitrofanov.ЗаПЧЕЛ возглавили Жданок, Плинер и Митрофанов [tpl]ref-ru[/tpl]
PCTVL emphasizes issues important to the Russian community. It supports Russian and Latgalian as co-official languages in those municipalities where more than 20% of native speakers exists, and requests the granting of Latvian citizenship to all non-citizens of Latvia. It supports stronger ties with Russia and was the only major political organization to oppose Latvia's membership in NATO. Economic issues are less emphasized but PCTVL's economic positions tend to be left-wing.
PCTVL was established in May 1998 by three political parties: National Harmony Party, Equal Rights and Socialist Party of Latvia, all of which were mainly supported by Russian-speaking voters. They won 16 out of 100 seats in the 1998 elections and 25 seats in the 2002 elections. As well as winning 13 out of 60 seats on Riga city council in the municipal elections in 2001. After the municipal elections, PCTVL became part of Riga's city government and its member Sergejs Dolgopolovs became the vice-mayor of Riga. At the municipal elections in 2005 the party won 13.68% of the votes and 9 seats on Riga city council.
During this period, PCTVL's most prominent leaders were Jānis Jurkāns, Alfrēds Rubiks and Tatjana Ždanoka. Rubiks and Ždanoka were previously prominent as the leaders of Latvian Communist Party and federalist movement in Latvia in the early 1990s. They are fairly popular in the Russian community but very unpopular among ethnic Latvians. This is one of the reasons for PCTVL remaining in opposition nationally, because any other party could face a massive backlash from their ethnically Latvian voters if they entered into a coalition with Rubiks and Ždanoka. 
PCTVL partially broke up in 2003. Tautas Saskaņas Partija was the first to leave the alliance and Socialist Party of Latvia followed half a year later. The remnant of PCTVL had only 6 members of the Latvian parliament (out of 25 that the alliance had before the breakup) but, according to public opinion polls, remained more popular than any of the parties that left the alliance in the 2004 European and 2005 municipal elections. PCTVL was the main force supporting Russian School Defense Staff activities in 2003-2005.
At the elections for the European Parliament PCTVL gained 9.66% of the vote and one seat, held by Tatjana Ždanoka, who sat with the The Greens–European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament.http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/ep6/owa/whos_mep.data?ipid=0&ilg=EN&iucd=28619&ipolgrp=Verts/ALE&ictry=.&itempl=&ireturn=&imode= It also proposed the idea of a Europe-wide party of ethnic Russians. PCTVL supports a federal Europe, with a "common economical and political space from Lisbon to Vladivostok". 
In the 2006 parliamentary elections PCTVL won 6 seats. In 2007 the alliance was transformed into one party. In recent years the party's support has declined as ethnic Russian voters have switched allegiance to Harmony Centre and in the Latvian parliamentary election, 2010, the party lost its representation in the Latvian Parliament.
In 2011, the party launched a popular initiative on amending the citizenship law.

[[Nova (rocket)]]

CATEGORIES: NASA space launch vehicles, Cancelled space launch vehicles

Nova was a series of proposed rocket designs, originally as NASA's first large launchers for missions similar to the production-level Saturn V. Nova studied designs that closely mirrored the Saturn V in basic concept, power, size and function. Differences were minor but practical, and the Saturn was selected for the Apollo Project largely because they would re-use existing facilities to a greater extent and could make it to the pad slightly earlier.
During a series of post-Apollo studies in the 1960s, considerations for a manned mission to Mars revealed the need for boosters much larger than Apollo's, and a new series of designs with as many as eight Rocketdyne F-1 engines were developed under the Nova name (along with the Saturn MLV). The image of the Nova C8 is commonly used as a representative of the entire Nova series, and many references to Nova refer specifically to these post-Apollo versions. The two series of designs were essentially separate, but shared their name. Thus, "Nova" does not refer to a specific rocket design, just a rocket larger than the Saturn V in most cases. To add more confusion, the final Saturn V design was larger than some of the early Nova proposals.

The Ontario general election of 2007 was held on October 10, 2007 to elect members (MPPs) of the 39th Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, Canada. The Liberals under Dalton McGuinty won the election with a majority government, winning 71 out of a possible 107 seats with 42.2% of the popular vote.CTV News The election set a record for the lowest voter turnout in an Ontario provincial election; only 52.8% people who were eligible voted. This broke the previous record of 54.7% in the 1923 election.CTV Toronto - Boring campaign behind poor voter turnout: analysts - CTV News, Shows and Sports - Canadian Television
As a result of legislation passed by the Legislature in 2004, election dates are now fixed by formula so that an election is held approximately four years after the previous election, unless the government is defeated by a vote of "no confidence" in the Legislature. Previously, the governing party had considerable flexibility to determine the date of an election anywhere up to five years of being elected. The date of this election was originally presumed to be October 4, 2007;[ref]
</ref> however, the law fixes the date on the first Thursday of October or on any day within seven days thereof if required to accommodate a date of "religious or cultural significance".  The date was set as October 10, 2007 to avoid a conflict with the [[Jewish]] holiday of [[Shemini Atzeret]], which fell on October 4, 2007.<ref name="new date"/>
In the same election, there was a provincial referendum on whether to change from first-past-the-post to mixed member proportional representation, as recommended by the Ontario Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform. This measure failed, with 37% of the participating electorate and 5 out of 107 ridings voting for the new system; a 60% supermajority was required province-wide, with at least half the ridings also supporting it by a simple majority.

A classical language is a language with a literature that is classical. According to UC Berkeley linguist George L. Hart, it should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own, not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature.University of California-Berkeley
Thus classical languages tend to either be dead languages, or show a high degree of diglossia, as the spoken varieties of the language diverge further and further away from the classical written language over centuries.

Lawrence Dale "Larry" Bell (April 5, 1894 – October 20, 1956) was an American industrialist and founder of Bell Aircraft Corporation.
Bell was born in Mentone, Indiana and lived there until 1907, when his family moved to Santa Monica, California. He joined his older brother Grover and stunt pilot Lincoln Beachey as a mechanic in 1912. Grover Bell was killed in a plane crash the following year, and Lawrence vowed to quit aviation for good; however, he went to work for the Glenn L. Martin Company after friends convinced him to return to the industry. He became Martin's shop foreman at age 20, and later the company's general manager.
He left Martin in 1928 to join Consolidated Aircraft in Buffalo, New York, eventually becoming vice president and general manager. When Consolidated relocated to San Diego, Bell stayed in Buffalo and founded his own company, Bell Aircraft Corporation, on July 10, 1935. Bell Aircraft built the P-39 "Airacobra" and P-63 "Kingcobra" fighter aircraft during World War II. Their P-59 "Airacomet" fighter was America's first jet-powered aircraft. Postwar, the company produced the Bell X-1, the first aircraft to break the sound barrier in level flight. The company began developing helicopters in 1941, with the Bell 30 taking its maiden flight in 1943. This early model evolved into the Bell 47, one of the most recognizable aircraft in history.
For his role in the X-1's first supersonic flight, he shared the 1947 Collier Trophy with pilot Chuck Yeager and John Stack, a research scientist with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (now NASA). He was awarded the Society of Automotive Engineers' Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1944, and was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame (1977), the Army Aviation Hall of Fame (1986), and the International Aerospace Hall of Fame (2004).

In 1986, Celebrezze was defeated in a bid for another term as chief justice by Thomas J. Moyer. The race between Celebrezze and Moyer was dirty, with Moyer's campaign accusing Celebrezze of having links to organized crime.

[[Disclaimer]]

CATEGORIES: Tort law

A disclaimer is generally any statement intended to specify or delimit the scope of rights and obligations that may be exercised and enforced by parties in a legally recognized relationship. In contrast to other terms for legally operative language, the term disclaimer usually implies situations that involve some level of uncertainty, waiver, or risk. 
A disclaimer may specify mutually agreed and privately arranged terms and conditions as part of a contract; or may specify warnings or expectations to the general public (or some other class of persons) in order to fulfill a duty of care owed to prevent unreasonable risk of harm or injury. Some disclaimers are intended to limit exposure to damages after a harm or injury has already been suffered. Additionally, some kinds of disclaimers may represent a voluntary waiver of a right or obligation that may be owed to the disclaimant.
Disclaimers vary in terms of their uniformity. Some may vary depending on the specific context and parties involved, while other types of disclaimers may strictly adhere to a uniform and established set of formalities that are rarely or never modified, except under official authority. Some of these formal disclaimers are required pursuant to industry regulation, qualification for protection under a safe harbor, and other situations where the exact wording of a particular clause or document may be dispositive in the event of a legal dispute. (See e.g., Product liability, Toxicity Class, Rule against perpetuities, Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act.)
The presence of a disclaimer in a legally binding agreement does not necessarily guarantee that the terms of the disclaimer will be recognized and enforced in a legal dispute. There may be other legal considerations that render a disclaimer void either in whole or part.

[[WapTV]]
CATEGORIES: Interactive television, Web browsers

WapTV was the name given to the company which originated the WTVML (Worldwide TV Mark-up Language) as a content format for the delivery of Interactive TV applications using Internet Servers. The system is an Interactive television technology platform comprising a microbrowser, a markup language, and a significant collection of associated software tools and services.WapTV 
The microbrowser and mark-up language are both based upon the Open Mobile Alliance WML 1.3 specification. The WTVML microbrowser is currently available only as an OpenTV application, although an MHP version of the Waptv browser has been built for demonstration and proof of concept. An emulator exists, based on Craftwork's, STBe OpenTV middleware emulation.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] 
The WTVML markup language is a heavily extended superset of the WAP Forum WML 1.3 specification. WML content originally designed for wireless delivery to mobile phone handsets will work without modification on the WTVML platform, with the exception that any WBMP images will not appear on the Sky Interactive microbrowser. WTVML version 6.1 was published as an ETSI standard in June 2004.webapps
The microbrowser and the WTVML markup language were originally developed by Ian Valentine, Patrick Sansom and Andy Hynes who founded WAPTV Ltd.{see.  }  The company and its technology was partly acquired by British Sky Broadcasting in 2000, and fully acquired in 2001 ( see http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/13832/BSkyB-snaps-rest-WapTV/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH ). Platform development has continued within BSkyB, and version 7 of the microbrowser and WTVML markup language was released in Q3 2004. The microbrowser and WTVML markup then became the cornerstone of British Sky Broadcasting's interactive platform strategy.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]  
The platform brings internet-style content and interactivity to the Sky Digital platform by deploying a purpose-built WML microbrowser to the Sky Digital set-top-box over the satellite broadcast stream. Web site owners simply have to serve well formatted WTVML from their web servers to allow Sky set-top boxes and consumers to fully interact with their web services. In March 2007, Sky together with some of the Waptv founders "spun off" the technology into a new Company "Miniweb", with the goals of furthering the work on WTVML in a global forum, and enabling the deployment of the system in other networks and devices.Miniweb's corporate site 
One of the goals in the foundation of Miniweb Interactive was to facilitate the interoperability of Interactive TV content and Services across multiple types of TV network and devices, as it was considered that a lack of TV Centric internet standards has inhibited the ubiquitous deployment of Internet services to TVs once they become connected via Broadband. Hence the name "Miniweb" so called because the TVML technology had the capability of creating a "mini web" of TV Sites (Apps) which inter-operated across different TV middleware and chip-sets.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]  
New IPTV networks have the need for a TV Browser in their set-top boxes and various solutions exist, however as of 2007, the WTVML microbrowser is probably the widest deployed TV Browser and has a growing community of compatible Interactive TV Sites. 
TV Sites for the OpenTV based Microbrowser are therefore web sites with a WTVML skin, and are often given a "wtv." sub-domain rather than a "www." sub-domain.  Until the introduction of Sky HD in 2006, most Sky set-top boxes uses a standard 28.8 kbit/s modem to pull content across the online link. Because WTVML content is compiled into an encoded format by an online gateway before transmission, it must be decoded on the set-top-box before it can be drawn to the screen. For optimal performance it is recommended that WTVML files (decks) for download are no more than 70 K in size, with individual cards within each deck no more than 5 K in size. When fully loaded, the browser comprises three separate virtual layers, devoted to MPEG-4 & JPEG still image presentation, MPEG video presentation and OnScreen Display (OSD) presentation respectively.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] 
Developers can combine modes to produce very rich and diverse interactive TV interfaces. Multiple modes can be defined as a modeset. Different modes in the modeset can be referenced from the WML cards and associated with service domains, allowing the browser to change its style as the user navigates from one service to another. A modeset is a collection of one or more modes defined in a standalone XML file. A modeset is referenced at deck level from the mode attribute of the wml element. A developer can define multiple modes within a single modeset, and can initiate changes between Modes within that Modeset at card level.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] 
The microbrowser can access Broadcast Resources as well as online resources delivered from a WTVML enabled web server. Broadcast Resources are content elements that are delivered in the satellite broadcast stream.
A doset can be used to specify a set of menu dos that can be easily applied to many cards and across many services. The doset is defined in an XML file that is referenced from the dosrc attribute of the modeset element. A single doset can be referenced by multiple modesets, and so can easily be applied across multiple domains and services.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] 
The names and locations of font resources for use within a service are defined by an XML document usually called fontset.xml. This document must be available from a URL, and is referred to from the fontsrc attribute of the WML.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Virtual machines, Systems programming languages

O-code is an intermediate language emitted by the BCPL compiler.  It is then compiled into the machine code for the computer which is intended to run the program.  This method of compiling allowed the original BCPL compiler to be ported to new machines very easily and as a result it became widespread.  The idea has since been used by many more recent compilers.  However most of them interpret their equivalent of O-code on a virtual machine rather than compiling it as was originally the case.

[[Oral literature]]
CATEGORIES: Literature by medium, Oral tradition

Oral literature or folk literature corresponds in the sphere of the spoken (oral) word to literature as literature operates in the domain of the written word. It thus forms a generally more fundamental component of culture, but operates in many ways as one might expect literature to do. The Ugandan scholar Pio Zirimu introduced the term orature in an attempt to avoid an oxymoron, but oral literature remains more common both in academic and popular writing.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Pre-literate societies, by definition, have no written literature, but may possess rich and varied oral traditions—such as folk epics, folklore, proverbs and folksong—that effectively constitute an oral literature. Even when these are collected and published by scholars such as folklorists and paremiographers, the result is still often referred to as "oral literature".
Literate societies may continue an oral tradition - particularly within the family (for example  bedtime stories) or informal social structures. The telling of urban legends may be considered an example of oral literature, as can jokes and also oral poetry including slam poetry which has been a televised feature on Russell Simmons' Def Poetry; performance poetry is a genre of poetry that consciously shuns the written form.Sam Parker, "Three-minute poetry? It’s all the rage", The Times, December 16, 2009.

[tpl]refimprove|date=November 2013[/tpl]The cradle of civilization is a term referring to locations identified as the sites of the emergence of civilization.
In Western European and Middle Eastern cultures, it has frequently been applied to the Ancient Near Eastern Chalcolithic (Ubaid period, Naqada culture), especially in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia and Levant) and Egypt, but also extended to sites in Asia Minor (Anatolia), Armeniahttp://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=1WOPkmChaFsC&oi=fnd&pg=PP8&dq=Anatolia+cradle+of+civilization&ots=DzMwcnE_Rg&sig=X9IHQWUwo_UnvfTRFWm24HXPVoc#PPA1,M1 The Near East: Archaeology in the "Cradle of Civilization", Charles Keith Maisels, Routledge 1993, ISBN 0-415-04742-0 and the Iranian Plateau (Elam).  Other civilizations arose in Asia, among cultures situated along large river valleys, notably the Indus River in the Indian Subcontinent and the Yellow River in China. Civilizations also arose independently in Egypt, Norte Chico in present-day Peru,[tpl]cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C.

If writing is considered an indicator of civilization, the earliest "cradle" to have writing was Sumer (Jemdet Nasr) in Mesopotamia.
Scholars have defined civilization using various criteria. The use of writing is a common one. Some standard criteria include a class-based society and public buildings. Current thinking is that there was no single "cradle", but several civilizations that developed independently, of which the Near Eastern Neolithic was the first. The extent to which there was significant influence between the early civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and those of East Asia is disputed. Scholars accept that the civilizations of Norte Chico in present-day Peru and that of Mesoamerica emerged independently from those in Eurasia.

The group discovered an endogenous opioid peptide in the porcine pituitary that proved difficult to isolate.  By sequencing the first 13 amino acids of the peptide, they created a synthetic version of the peptide with a similar potency to the natural peptide.  Goldstein et al. applied the synthetic peptide to the guinea ileum longitudinal muscle and found it to be an extraordinarily potent opioid peptide.  The peptide was called dynorphin (from the Greek dynamis=power) to describe its potency.
Dynorphins exert their effects primarily through the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), a G-protein-coupled receptor.  Two subtypes of KORs have been identified: K1 and K2.  Although KOR is the primary receptor for all dynorphins, the peptides do have some affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), δ-opioid receptor (DOR),and the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lai J, Luo MC, Chen Q, Ma S, Gardell LR, Ossipov MH, Porreca F | title = Dynorphin A activates bradykinin receptors to maintain neuropathic pain | journal = Nat.

He was one of the most dominating pitchers of the 19th century and posted impressive statistics in one category or another for almost every season he pitched. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964.
Keefe's career spanned much of baseball's formative stages. His first season was the last in which pitchers threw from 45 feet, so for most of his career he pitched from 50 feet. His final season was the first season in which pitchers hurled from the modern distance of 60 feet, 6 inches.

[[Sharks (rugby union)]]

CATEGORIES: Super Rugby teams, South African rugby union teams, Sport in Durban, Sport in KwaZulu-Natal, 1995 establishments in South Africa

The Sharks are a South African rugby union team competing in the Super Rugby competition (Super 10, 1993–95; Super 12, 1996 – 2005; Super 14, 2006–10; Super Rugby 2011- ). They are based in Durban and centred around the Natal Sharks union, also based in Durban and drawing players from all of KwaZulu-Natal Province.
In 1993–95 South Africa was represented in the Super 10 by their three top unions (top three teams from the previous years Currie Cup).  Natal (as they were called then) qualified in 1993 and 1994.  Natal were runners-up in 1994 after having lost to Queensland 21-10 in the final. In 1996 and 1997 South Africa was represented in the Super 12 by their four top unions rather than franchises, and Natal qualified and competed both years. They have never won any of the Super Rugby competition, but have reached the final four times, as Natal in 1996 and as the Sharks in 2001, 2007 and 2012.
Through 2005, they drew players from the two unions based in Eastern Cape Province, the Mighty Elephants (Port Elizabeth) and the Border Bulldogs (East London), but those unions became the core of the new Southern Spears franchise that was formed in 2006 and was originally intended to enter the Super 14 in 2007 but was later denied admission. The current team captain is Bismarck du Plessis. The side contains many other Springbok players, including  Tendai 'Beast' Mtawarira, Willem Alberts, JP Pietersen, Patrick Lambie and the brothers Bismarck and Jannie du Plessis. They have also featured many international stars including France international Frédéric Michalak. In 2010, they were slated to feature Argentine star Juan Martín Hernández, but he was ruled out for the season with a back injury.
In 2011 the Super Rugby competition was expanded again to feature an additional team from Australia changing the competition to the Super Rugby tournament. The 2012 season saw the Sharks struggle in the first few weeks, but a run of good form saw them lose only one of their last seven games to sneak into the playoffs in 6th position. They had to travel to Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane, Australia for the qualifier against The Reds, whom they beat 30-17 to reach the semi-finals. They then had to travel another 11 000 km back to Cape Town to face the Stormers, they were not given much of a chance after having crossed the Indian for the second time in as many weeks, but again they prevailed 26-19. Having beaten the Crusaders in the other semi-final, the Chiefs claimed home ground advantage for the final. After travelling over the Indian yet again (the third time in three weeks, 55 000 km travelled in total) to Hamilton, the Sharks met the Chiefs for the final, but the fairytale was not to be, and they were defeated 37-6 by the Chiefs, who claimed their first ever Super Rugby title.

Calydon ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|l|ɨ|d|ɒ|n[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Καλυδών[/tpl]; gen.: Καλυδῶνος) was an ancient Greek city in Aetolia, situated on the west bank of the river Evenus. According to Greek mythology, the city took its name from its founder Calydon, son of Aetolus. Close to the city stood Mount Zygos, the slopes of which provided the setting for the hunt of the Calydonian Boar. The city housed the important Aetolian sanctuary known as the Laphrion, dedicated to Artemis Laphria and Apollo Laphrios. In 31 BC, the Roman Emperor Octavian removed the population of the city to the new colony of Nicopolis, founded to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Actium earlier that year. At the same time, the Romans removed most of the art and treasures of the city to Patras, including the gold and ivory cultic statue of Artemis. Strabo, in his Geographia, comments on the former beauty of Calydon, which by his time lay desolate:  '...Calydon and Pleuron, which are now indeed reduced, though in early times these settlements were an ornament to Greece.' 
Calydon is also referenced in nearly every episode of the Canadian cartoon-series The Mighty Hercules, with Hercules oft coming to the rescue of its king Dorian due to the young king's always being in danger of dethronement from two of Hercules' archenemies, Daedelus (evil magician) and Mertus (aka "The Mask").

William Eustis (June 10, 1753 – February 6, 1825) was an early American physician, politician, and statesman from Massachusetts.  Trained in medicine, he served as a military surgeon during the American Revolutionary War, notably at the Battle of Bunker Hill.  He resumed medical practice after the war, but soon entered politics.
After several terms in the state legislature, Eustis won election to the United States Congress in 1800, serving as a moderate Democratic-Republican.  He briefly returned to state politics after losing reelection in 1804, and was chosen to be Secretary of War in 1809 by President James Madison.  Due in part to his inexperience at managing the army and a lack of preparedness, the military failures in the early months of the War of 1812 were laid on his shoulders, leading to his resignation.
Madison then appointed Eustis Minister to the Netherlands, a post he held from 1814 until 1818.  After another period in Congress, he was elected Governor of Massachusetts in 1822.  A popular successor to long-serving John Brooks, Eustis died in office in 1825.  His Boston mansion, built in the 1750s by royal governor William Shirley, is known as the Shirley-Eustis House and is a National Historic Landmark.

They have not achieved great success in the competition, finishing at the bottom of the table six times (in 1998, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012). However, they have managed to reach the semifinal stage twice (in 2000 and 2001). The Lions play in a red and white strip.
The team faced relegation from the Super 14 after the Southern Spears won a court ruling that they be included in the competition in place of the lowest ranked South African team in the 2006 competition. http://www.pretorianews.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3376189 However, the Spears and the country's national federation, the South African Rugby Union, reached a settlement of their legal case.

Sîn-lēqi-unninni was an incantation/exorcist priest (mashmashshu) who lived in Mesopotamia in the period between 1300 BC and 1000 BC. He is the compiler of the best preserved version of the Epic of Gilgamesh.  His name is listed in the text itself, which is unusual for works written in cuneiform. His version is known by its incipit, or first line  "Sha naqba īmuru" ("He who saw the deep" or "The one who saw the Abyss").  It is unknown how different his version is from the earlier texts.
The only time when Sin-liqe-unninni narrates the story in first person is in the prologue. His version includes Utnapishtim's story of the Flood in tablet XI and in tablet XII the Sumerian Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld.
Sîn-lēqi-unninni's name means 'Sîn (the Moon God) is one who accepts my prayer'. It is also sometimes transcribed, albeit less probably, as 'Sîn-liqe-unninni', meaning 'O Sîn! Accept my prayer'.George, A.R. The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, critical edition and cuneiform, p.27

[[Stormers]]

CATEGORIES: Super Rugby teams, South African rugby union teams, Sport in Cape Town

The Stormers, for sponsorship reasons referred to as DHL Stormers, is a South African professional Rugby union team based in Cape Town competing in the Super Rugby competition (formerly Super 14). Despite their lack of silverware over the years, their home stadium, Newlands, typically draws the highest average attendance figures of any ground in Super Rugby. The team's captain for 2012 is centre Jean de Villiers.
They are centered on the Western Province Currie Cup side, but also draw players from the Boland Cavaliers (covering the Cape Winelands and West Coast districts, with home matches in Wellington). Through 2005, they also drew players from the SWD Eagles (George), which meant that they drew players from all three unions in the Western Cape Province. However, the general realignment of franchise areas resulting from the expansion of the competition resulted in the Eagles being moved to the area of the Southern Spears, which were originally to enter the Super 14 in 2007 but have since been denied entry into the competition.
Prior to 1998, South Africa did not use a franchise system for the Super 12, instead sending the top four unions from its domestic competition, the Currie Cup, into the Super 12. In 1996, the Stormers qualified and competed in the Super 12 as Western Province. In 1997, they did not qualify, the 4th South African team being the Orange Free State (now the Free State Cheetahs at Currie Cup level; the region would later be represented in Super 12 by the Cats (now known as the Lions) and in Super 14 by the Central Cheetahs).
The Stormers played their first ever final, against the Vodacom Bulls, in 2010 after beating the Waratahs in the semi-final stage but ultimately lost to the Bulls. In the two previous years in which they reached the semi-finals, 1999 and 2004, they were eliminated by the Highlanders and Crusaders.

James Roosevelt "Tadd" Roosevelt, Jr., (August 20, 1879 – June 7, 1958) was an American automobile worker. He and his sister Helen Rebecca Roosevelt (1881–1962) were the children of diplomat James Roosevelt "Rosey" Roosevelt (1854–1927) of the Roosevelt family and Helen Schermerhorn Astor (1855–1893) of the Astor family.
Tadd's uncles were President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945) and Colonel John Jacob "Jack" Astor IV (1864–1912), but nonetheless was three years older than Franklin. Tadd's paternal grandparents were businessman James Roosevelt I (1828–1900) and Rebecca Brien Howland (1831–1876) while his maternal grandparents were businessman William Backhouse Astor, Jr. (1829–1892) and socialite Caroline Webster "Lina" Schermerhorn (1830–1908).
Upon his mother's death in November 1893, Tadd inherited $1,500,000 (equivalent to approximately $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|1500000|1893|r=0[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars). He and Franklin both attended Groton School and Harvard University, with Tadd being ahead of Franklin. Their kinship led to Franklin often being mockingly referred to as "Uncle Frank" while the two attended Groton together.
After Tadd dropped out from Harvard, he married Hungarian-born prostitute Sadie Messinger (c. 1880–1940) on June 14, 1900. Tadd's father Rosey, upon learning of the wedding, came down from Hyde Park and brought Tadd home.[tpl]cite news|title=Boy Millionaire Weds; James R.

Grandmother Lina and Grandfather James also highly disapproved of his marriage to Sadie.
In February 1917, Tadd was arrested in Florida and required to stay in Florida pending a divorce suit. He had lived in Daytona under the name "M. S. King" with a different woman than Sadie. The Roosevelt family had reportedly opposed the marriage to Sadie and had prevailed in achieving a separation, in which Sadie was to receive a $10,000 (equivalent to approximately $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|10000|1917|r=0[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars) annual income.[tpl]cite news|title=J.R.

Homes Not Jails is an American organization that emerged from two of San Francisco's prominent activist organizations Food Not Bombs and the San Francisco Tenants Union and describes itself as an all-volunteer organization committed to housing homeless people through direct action.Corr, Anders.

Homes not jails groups do "housing takeovers", acts of civil disobedience in which vacant buildings are publicly occupied, to demonstrate the availability of vacant property and to advocate that it be used for housing.  The group has done many such occupations.  Homes Not Jails has also done and assisted with hundreds of "covert" squats in which vacant buildings are broken into so that people in need of housing can move in.  
Invoking squatters' rights, Homes Not Jails has filed for legal ownership of a squat opened in 1993 through a process called adverse possession.  Homes Not Jails recommend that squats that are set up run themselves according to three main principles: nonviolence, no drugs, and consensus decision-making. These recommendations apply to both types of Homes Not Jails occupation:  covert squats, and public takeovers of symbolic buildings and are not policed in any way with individual squats running themselves autonomously.  Homes Not Jails also encourages city and state officials to use their eminent domain powers to declare unused and vacant buildings a public nuisance, take them over and use them for low cost housing.Articles of Interest to GP Members.

The Venezuelan recall referendum of 15 August 2004 was a referendum to determine whether Hugo Chávez, then President of Venezuela, should be recalled from office. The recall referendum was announced on 8 June 2004 by the National Electoral Council (CNE) after the Venezuelan opposition succeeded in collecting the number of signatures required by the 1999 Constitution to effect a recall.
The result of the referendum was not to recall Chávez (58% no), but there have been allegations of fraud.

Takatāpui (also spelt takataapui) is the Māori word meaning a devoted partner of the same sex.Hutchins, 145.Sears, 592-3.Tregear, 452. In modern terminology, a person that identifies as takatāpui is a Māori individual who is queer, in other words gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or transsexual (LGBT).Hutchins, 7-13. Takatāpui is used nowadays in response to Western construction of "sexuality, gender, and corresponding identity expressions." (Gender identity and sexual identity). The term encompasses not only aspects of sexuality but also one's cultural identity.Hutchins, 15-6. As a result of heterosexism from "internalized colonialism within Māori communities" and colonialism in its racist forms in non-Māori LGBT communities, indigenous identities that are "living entities that are fluid, transformative, collective, deeply personal and, at times, intentionally ambiguous" have also been subject to homonormative and tribal normativity. Takatāpui incorporates both a sense of indigenous identity and communicates sexual orientation; it has become an umbrella term to build solidarity among sexuality and gender minorities within Māori communities.Leap, page 174-180.
Takatāpui is not a new term, but the application of it is recent. The Dictionary of the Māori Language—first compiled by missionary Herbert Williams in 1832—notes the definition as "intimate companion of the same sex".Hutchins, 15. After a long period of disuse there has been a resurgence since the 1980s for a label to describe an individual that is both Māori and non-heterosexual. The word takatāpui was found to have existed in pre-colonial New Zealand to describe relationships between people of the same sex. The existence of this word defies the conservative Māori argument that homosexuality did not exist in Māori society prior to the arrival of Europeans.

Joseph Bert Tinker (July 27, 1880 – July 27, 1948) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played from 1902 through 1916 for the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Chicago Whales of the Federal League.
Born in Muscotah, Kansas, Tinker began playing semi-professional baseball in Kansas in the late 19th century. He began his professional career in 1900 in minor league baseball and made his MLB debut with the Cubs in 1902. Tinker was a member of the Chicago Cubs dynasty that won four pennants and two World Series championships between 1906 and 1910. After playing one season with Cincinnati in 1913, he became one of the first stars to jump to the upstart Federal League in 1914. After leading the Whales to the pennant in 1915, he returned to the Cubs as their player-manager in 1916, his final season in MLB.
Tinker returned to minor league baseball as a part-owner and manager for the Columbus Senators before moving to Orlando, Florida, to manage the Orlando Tigers. While in Orlando, Tinker developed a real estate firm, which thrived during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. However, the 1926 Miami hurricane and Great Depression cost Tinker most of his fortune, and he returned to professional baseball in the late 1930s.
With the Cubs, Tinker was a part of a great double-play combination with teammates Johnny Evers and Frank Chance that was immortalized as "Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance" in the poem "Baseball's Sad Lexicon". However, Evers and Tinker feuded off the field. Tinker was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946, the same year as Evers and Chance. He has also been honored by the Florida State League and the city of Orlando.

A military satellite is an artificial satellite used for a military purpose. The most common missions are intelligence gathering, navigation and military communications.The first military satellites were photographic reconnaissance missions. Some attempts were made to develop satellite based weapons but this work was halted in 1967 following the ratification of international treaties banning the deployment of weapons of mass destruction in orbit. As of 2013, there are 950 satellites of all types in Earth orbit. It is not possible to identify the exact number of these that are military satellites partly due to secrecy and partly due to dual purpose missions such as GPS satellites that serve both civilian and military purposes.

Romano was a brash, insensitive man who often made racist or bigoted comments.  Although he was a deliberately unpleasant and cruel character, he also frequently provided comic relief, and thus became popular with viewers as ER's "man you love to hate".

[[Short-term mission]]

CATEGORIES: Christian missions

A short-term mission (STM) is the mobilization of a Christian missionary for a short period of time ranging from days to a year; many short-term missions are called mission trips. The short-term missionary is a fairly recent innovation in the global missions movement, but many short-term missions agencies are seeing an increased number of trips that consist of a week up to a year.
Generally, missionaries have been people sent to spread their religious faith, usually among the people of another country or region in which that faith is not widely practiced.missionary. (2005). In The Macquarie Dictionary. Retrieved from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/macqdict/missionary In the past 50 years, churches have moved toward mobilizing young people for short-term trips.
Youth with a Mission (YWAM) and Operation Mobilisation (OM) were two of the first organizations to utilize short term missions.Howell, Brian: A Brief History Short-term Mission in America (Part 1) http://www.roundtripmissions.com/content/roots-short-term-missionary-1960-1985  In the late 1950s, OM Founder George Verwer began mobilizing young people for summer missions.According to the Missionary Research Library, there were about 43,000 Protestant missionaries in the world in 1958. This is four times as many as when the century began. Of this number 27,733 are from the US.[tpl]cite book|last=Neill|first=Stephen|title=A HIstory of Christian Missions|year=1965|publisher=Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|pages=458[/tpl]   In the summer 1963, over 2,000 people joined the first short-term mission teams with Operation Mobilization.  They worked throughout Europe and found creative ways of getting behind the Iron Curtain. Youth With a Misison (YWAM) began in the 1960s under the leadership of Loren Cunningham.  He pioneered short term missions and introduced the idea that young people could be missionaries. Generally, missionaries were expected to have extensive theological training before going into the foreign mission field, but YWAM provided short-term opportunities for young people who had a passion for Jesus Christ to share their faith in a way that was powerful and effective. Eventually, YWAM began offering courses to train missionaries as a substitution or supplement to formal theological training. With OM, the summer conferences continued each year but the participants dwindled. In late 1987, a renewed vision for reaching Europe was born.  This led to the “Love Europe” outreaches that started in July 1989. OM planned for 5,000 young people from 50 nations to participate; in fact, about 7,000 from 76 nations came.
In 1970, there were very few youth groups doing short-term missions in the United States. However, during the 1980s and '90s missiologically progressive churches began to take a project approach to missions, capitalizing on directing present energy into short-term missions trips, vacations with a purpose, designated projects and offerings, and ministry teams.
The project approach has matured in the modern Short-term Missions (STM) movement and become a standard annual feature for thousands of Christian youth groups, church groups, and individuals across the United States. In a national survey in 2006 it was determined that 2.1% of church members of all denominations (1.6 million people) had been on a short-term mission trip in the past year, and 3.6% claimed to have participated in an STM as teens. [tpl]cite journal|author=ROBERT J. PRIEST, TERRY DISCHINGER, STEVE RASMUSSEN, C. M. BROWN|journal=Missiology|year=2006|pages=431–450[/tpl] 
There are independent Short-term Missions Organizations (STMs) as well as denominations and individual churches that facilitate these trips all over the world. Many STMs "sending agencies" are adopting of Standards of Excellence in Short-term Missions.
Criticisms
Recently, experts have argued that short-term missions tend to actually cause more harm than good. Objections include the rise of unjustified paternalism, lack of knowledge of local culture, wrong motivations in team members, undercutting of local ministries and pastors, and massive spending. In their book When Helping Hurts, Brian Fikkert and Steve Corbett expand upon these problems and suggest alternatives in poverty-alleviation.

In genetics, a nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA, and in a  truncated, incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein product. It differs from a missense mutation, which is a point mutation where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid. Some genetic disorders, such as thalassemia and DMD, result from nonsense mutations.

[[Extensive farming]]
CATEGORIES: Agriculture

Extensive farming or extensive agriculture (as opposed to intensive farming) is an agricultural production system that uses small inputs of labor, fertilizers, and capital, relative to the land area being farmed.
Extensive farming most commonly refers to sheep and cattle farming in areas with low agricultural productivity, but can also refer to large-scale growing of wheat, barley and other grain crops in areas like the Murray-Darling Basin. Here, owing to the extreme age and poverty of the soils, yields per hectare are very low, but the flat terrain and very large farm sizes mean yields per unit of labour are high. Nomadic herding is an extreme example of extensive farming, where herders move their animals to use feed from occasional rainfalls.

[[Naomi (biblical figure)]]
CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible people, People from Bethlehem, Book of Ruth, Women in the Bible

Naomi (נָעֳמִי "Pleasant; agreeable; my sweet", Standard Hebrew Noʻomi, Tiberian Hebrew nåʿå̆mī) is Ruth's mother-in-law in the Old Testament Book of Ruth.  Later, she called herself Mara, or "bitter" (Ruth 1:20-21), she said to the women on Bethlehem, "Do not call me Naomi call me Mara (מרה), for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me," referring to the death of her husband (Elimelech) and her two sons (Mahlon and Chilion). In Ruth 1:13, she had said to her two daughters-in-law "it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me," (ESV), but the NIV translates this as "It is more bitter for me than for you..." which indicates that Naomi is indeed bitter. Barry Webb points out that there is both an objective element in her life being bitter (bereavement, dislocation and poverty), as well as a subjective element - the bitterness she feels.Barry G. Webb, Five Festal Garments (Leicester: Apollos, 2000), 42.
Naomi had with her a faithful daughter-in-law named Ruth who decided to follow her, while Orpah, her other daughter-in-law, chose to go back to Moab. Ruth marries Boaz and they have a son, whom Naomi cares for, and so the women of the town say "Naomi has a son" (Ruth 4:17). In this way, the book can be seen to be Naomi's story: Gregory Goswell argues that Naomi is the central character of the book, whereas Ruth is the main character.Gregory Goswell, "What's in a Name? Book Titles in the Latter Prophets and Writings", Pacifica 21 (2008), 8. The son in question was Obed, who later became the grandfather of David.
Barry Webb argues that in Ruth 1, Naomi's "perception of her condition" is "distorted by self-absorption," but that Ruth plays "a key role in her rehabilitation."Webb, Five Festal Garments, 43. Webb also points out Naomi's "feminine scheming" in forcing Boaz's hand.Webb, Five Festal Garments, 38. Abraham Kuyper, on the other hand, asserts that "Naomi has such innate nobility of character that she immediately elicits from us our most sincere sympathy."Abraham Kuyper, Women of the Old Testament (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1941), 89.
Yitzhak Berger suggests that Naomi's plan was that Ruth seduce Boaz, just as Tamar and the daughters of Lot all seduced "an older family member in order to become the mother of his offspring." At the crucial moment, however, "Ruth abandons the attempt at seduction and instead requests a permanent, legal union with Boaz."[tpl]cite journal|last=Berger|first=Yitzhak|title=Ruth and Inner-Biblical Allusion: The Case of 1 Samuel 25|journal=JBL|year=2009|volume=128|issue=2|page=268[/tpl] Emphasis original.

[[Dusky Moorhen]]
CATEGORIES: Gallinula, Birds of South Australia, Birds of Tasmania, Birds of Western Australia

The Dusky Moorhen (Gallinula tenebrosa) is a bird in the rail family. It occurs in Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia.
The New Guinea birds are smaller, at 25–32 cm in length, than the Australian race (35–40 cm, 55–65 cm wingspan). In Indonesia, this species is declining because of competition from the closely related Common Moorhen on the islands where both birds occur.
The adult Dusky Moorhen is mainly dark grey-black, with a browner tinge to the upper parts. It has a red frontal shield and yellow-tipped red bill like its Eurasian relative, but lacks the white flank line shown by Common Moorhen, and has orange-yellow rather than yellow legs.
Sexes are similar, but young birds have mid-brown plumage. This is a noisy species with a loud kruk call.
Dusky Moorhen is found in wetland habitats, with a preference for freshwater marshes. It will forage on rubbish tips, and is generally omnivorous, taking a wide variety of plant and animal food.
This species builds a bulky nest at the water's edge, and lays 5-18 whitish eggs. It is territorial when breeding, but otherwise gregarious.

If ordinary candles are too hot, a special wax blend with a high concentration of mineral oil can be heated to lower temperatures in a crock pot or double boiler.

[[Regional geography]]

CATEGORIES: Area studies, Branches of geography, History of geography, Regional geography

Regional geography is the study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions.
Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to quantitative geography or critical geography. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the quantitative revolution. Main critics were G. H. T. KimbleKimble, G.H.T. (1951): The Inadequacy of the Regional Concept, London Essays in Geography, edd. L.D. Stamp and S.W. Wooldridge, pp. 492-512. and Fred K. Schaefer.Schaefer, F.K. (1953): Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, vol. 43, pp. 226-245.
The regional geography paradigm has had an impact on many other geographical sciences, including economic geography and geomorphology. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world, such as Northern and Latin America, Europe, and Asia and their countries. In addition, the notion of a city-regional approach to the study of geography gained some credence in the mid-1990s through the work of geographers such as Saskia Sassen, although it was also criticized, for example by Peter Storper.
Notable figures in regional geography were Alfred Hettner in Germany, with his concept of chorology; Paul Vidal de la Blache in France, with the possibilism approach (possibilism being a softer notion than environmental determinism); and, in the United States, Richard Hartshorne with his concept of areal differentiation.
Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other scales.MacLeod, G. and Jones, M. (2001): Renewing The Geography of Regions, Environment and Planning D, 16(9), pp. 669-695.

[[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)]]

CATEGORIES: Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom)

The Leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition in the United Kingdom (more commonly known as the Leader of the Opposition) is the politician who leads the official opposition in the United Kingdom. There is also a Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.  However since the Parliament Act 1911 (which followed, without legislation, the last Prime Minister in the House of Lords, the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury in 1902) there has been no dispute that the leader in the House of Commons is pre-eminent and holds the main title. 
The Leader of the Opposition by convention leads the largest party not within the government: where one party wins outright this is the party leader of the second largest political party in the House of Commons. He or she is normally viewed as an alternative Prime Minister, and is a member of the Privy Council.
In the nineteenth century party affiliations were generally less fixed and leaders in the two Houses were often of equal status.  A single, clear leader of the opposition was only definitively settled if the opposition leader in Commons or Lords was the outgoing Prime Minister.
The Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as Member of Parliament. In 2010, this additional entitlement was available up to £73,617.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m06.pdf|title=parliament.uk|date=May 2011[/tpl]
