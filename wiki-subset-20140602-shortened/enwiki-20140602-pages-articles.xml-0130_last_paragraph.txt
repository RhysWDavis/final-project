[[Meliorism]]

CATEGORIES: Metaphysical theories

Meliorism is an idea in metaphysical thinking holding that progress is a real concept leading to an improvement of the world.  It holds that humans can, through their interference with processes that would otherwise be natural, produce an outcome which is an improvement over the aforementioned natural one.
Meliorism, as a conception of the person and society, is at the foundation of contemporary liberal democracy and human rights and is a basic component of liberalism.http://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/media/File/dp068.pdf
Another important understanding of the meliorist tradition comes from the American Pragmatic tradition.  One can read about it in the works of Lester Frank Ward, William James, Ralph Nader, and John Dewey.
Meliorism has also been used by Arthur Caplan to describe positions in bioethics that are in favor of ameliorating conditions which cause suffering, even if the conditions have long existed (e.g. being in favor of cures for common diseases, being in favor of serious anti-aging therapies as they are developed).

[[Nonogram]]
CATEGORIES: Nonograms, Digital geometry, Logic puzzles, NP-complete problems

Nonograms, also known as Hanjie or Griddlers, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups.
These puzzles are often black and white, describing a binary image, but they can also be colored. If colored, the number clues are also colored to indicate the color of the squares. Two differently colored numbers may have a space in between them. For example, a black four followed by a red two could mean four black boxes, some empty spaces, and two red boxes, or it could simply mean four black boxes followed immediately by two red ones.
Nonograms have no theoretical limits on size, and are not restricted to square layouts.

[[Situation puzzle]]

CATEGORIES: Puzzles

Situation puzzles are often referred to as lateral thinking puzzles or "yes/no" puzzles.
Situation puzzles are usually played in a group, with one person hosting the puzzle and the others asking questions which can only be answered with a "yes" or "no" answer.  Depending upon the settings and level of difficulty, other answers, hints or simple explanations of why the answer is yes or no, may be considered acceptable. The puzzle is solved when one of the players is able to recite the narrative the host had in mind, in particular explaining whatever aspect of the initial scenario was puzzling.
These puzzles are inexact and many puzzle statements have more than one possible fitting answer.  The goal however is to find out the story as the host has it in mind. Critical thinking and reading, logical thinking, as well as lateral thinking may all be required to solve a situation puzzle. The term lateral thinking was coined by Edward De Bono to denote a creative problem-solving style that involves looking at the given situation from unexpected angles, and is typically necessary to the solution of situation puzzles.
The term "lateral-thinking puzzle" was popularised by Paul Sloane in his 1992 book Lateral Thinking Puzzlers.Jed Hartman, Rec.puzzles archive 27 Aug 1998 http://www.kith.org/logos/things/sitpuz/lateral.html

Dervla Murphy (born November 28, 1931, Ireland) is an Irish touring cyclist and author of adventure travel books for over 40 years.
Murphy is best known for her 1965 book Full Tilt: Ireland to India With a Bicycle, about an overland cycling trip through Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. She followed this by volunteering with Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal, and trekking with a mule through Ethiopia. Murphy took a break from travel writing following the birth of her daughter, and then wrote about her travels with Rachel in India, Pakistan, South America, Madagascar and Cameroon. She later wrote about her solo trips through Romania, Africa, Laos, the states of the former Yugoslavia, and Siberia. In 2005 she visited Cuba with her daughter and three granddaughters.
Murphy has normally traveled alone and unaided, without luxuries and depending on the hospitality of local people. She has been in dangerous situations; for example, she was attacked by wolves in the former Yugoslavia, threatened by soldiers in Ethiopia, and robbed in Siberia. However, she described her worst incident as tripping over cats at home and shattering her left arm.Allan, Vicky (2007) On Top of the World Sunday Herald, 20 January 2007[tpl]cite news |last=Toksvig |first=Sandi | authorlink=Sandi Toksvig |title=Excess Baggage |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=2007-12-15 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/excessbaggage/index_20071215.shtml[/tpl]

He started his broadcasting career working for Piccadilly Radio, Manchester as a teenager, before moving to London as a presenter for the BBC's Greater London Radio and then Channel 4 television, where The Big Breakfast made him a star. Soon he was able to dictate highly favourable terms, allowing him to broadcast on competing radio and TV stations. Slots like Radio 1 Breakfast Show and TFI Friday provided an appealing mix of celebrity interviews, music and comic games, delivered in an irreverent style that attracted complaints and higher ratings in equal measure. By 2000 he was the UK's highest paid entertainer, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.
In 2005, he started a new career on Radio 2, involving the long-running Drivetime programme, as well as a new breakfast show. More recent work for BBC1 and Channel 4 has not achieved the success of his earlier ventures.

Peter Frankenfeld (born Willi Julius August Frankenfeldt on May 31, 1913 in Berlin – January 4, 1979 in Hamburg) was a German comedian, radio and television personality.
After World War II he became an interpreter with the U.S. military government. In 1948 he went into broadcasting. He pioneered quiz programs on West German radio and television, becoming the country's best-known programme host and entertainer. He is remembered for some classic sketches such as "Der Überzieher" (about a man getting in trouble in a restaurant because he has to constantly guard his overcoat), "Die Bürgschaft" (his bumbling attempt to recite Schiller's poem The Hostage), or "Die Wetterkarte" (The Weather Chart, where he speaks in a wide variety of German dialects). 
In 1962, he and director Heinz Dunkhase discovered the comedy sketch Dinner for One in Blackpool which was staged in Frankenfeld's live show shortly thereafter, and recorded on July 8, 1963. The show was re-run occasionally in German television until it got its fixed spot on New Year's Eve in 1972.

The Volga Germans ([tpl]lang-de|Wolgadeutsche[/tpl] or Russlanddeutsche, [tpl]lang-ru|Поволжские немцы[/tpl], Povolzhskie nemtsy) were ethnic Germans living along the River Volga in the region of southeastern European Russia around Saratov and to the south. Recruited as immigrants to Russia in the 18th century, they were allowed to maintain their German culture, language, traditions and churches: (Lutheran, Reformed, Catholics, and Mennonites).  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Volga Germans emigrated to the Dakotas and other states in the Western United States, as well as to Canada and South America (mainly Argentina and Brazil). 
After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 during World War II, the Soviet government considered the Volga Germans potential collaborators and transported many of them eastwards, where several died. After the war, the Soviet Union expelled some ethnic Germans to the West.  In the late 1980s, many of the remaining ethnic Germans moved from the Soviet Union to Germany.

Tempelhof was designated as an airport by the Ministry of Transport on 8 October 1923. The old terminal was originally constructed in 1927. In anticipation of increasing air traffic, the Nazi government began a massive reconstruction in the mid-1930s. While it was occasionally cited as the world's oldest still operating commercial airport, the title was disputed by several other airports, and is no longer an issue since its closure.
Tempelhof was one of Europe's three iconic pre-World War II airports, the others being London's now defunct Croydon Airport and the old Paris – Le Bourget Airport. One of the airport's most distinctive features is its large, canopy-style roof, which was able to accommodate most contemporary airliners during its heyday in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, thereby protecting passengers from the elements. Tempelhof Airport's main building was once among the top 20 largest buildings on earth; in contrast, it formerly had the world's smallest duty-free shop.Airports International June 1975 (industry magazine)

Bedgrove is one of the housing estates of the modern town of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, though it takes its name from a farm and hamlet that stood in the area until the area was cleared for building in the late 1950s.  At the time it was built it was the largest housing estate of its kind in the country.The Bucks Herald (2002) Memory Lane Aylesbury: Into The Seventies. Derby: Breedon Books  The housing estate is on the south side of the town.  The farm (and associated cottages) was where Pevensey Close now stands.
In the 2001 census the population of Bedgrove was 9,171 people.
Also the ancient village of Caldicot (mentioned in the Domesday Book) was thought to be situated approximately where Caldicot Close is today, hence the name of the new road.

CATEGORIES: American Basketball Association teams, Basketball clubs established in 1967, Dallas Chaparrals, Defunct basketball teams in Texas

The Dallas Chaparrals were a charter member of the American Basketball Association, later becoming the San Antonio Spurs and joining the NBA.
The team's original owners, unable to agree on a name for the franchise during an early organizational meeting at the Sheraton Dallas Hotel, named it for the Chaparral Club in which they were meeting. The team suffered from poor attendance and general disinterest in Dallas. They were lucky to attract crowds in the hundreds.  During the 1970–71 season, the team became the Texas Chaparrals and an attempt was made to make the team a regional one, playing games in Fort Worth, Texas, at the Tarrant County Coliseum, as well as Lubbock, Texas, at the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum, but this proved a failure and the team returned full-time to Dallas in time for the 1971–72 season, splitting their games at Moody Coliseum and Dallas Convention Center Arena.
After missing the playoffs for the first time in their existence in the 1972–73 season, the team was put up for sale.  After no credible offers surfaced, the team's original owners leased it to a group of 36 San Antonio businessmen, led by Angelo Drossos and Red McCombs.  The deal included a three-year option to buy the team outright, after which it would revert to the Dallas group. The Drossos-McCombs group moved the team to San Antonio for the 1973–74 season and renamed them the San Antonio Gunslingers before renaming them the San Antonio Spurs. San Antonio embraced its new team with open arms; the Spurs surpassed the Chaparrals' entire 1972–73 attendance in only 16 games. Realizing they had a runaway hit on their hands, Drossos and McCombs tore up the lease and completed the purchase after only one year, and the franchise has stayed in San Antonio to this day.

[[Great and Little Kimble]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Buckinghamshire, Civil parishes in Buckinghamshire, Hill forts in Buckinghamshire

Great and Little Kimble is a civil parish in Wycombe district, Buckinghamshire. It is located [tpl]convert|5|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to the south of Aylesbury. In addition to the villages of Great Kimble and Little Kimble it contains the hamlets of Kimblewick and Marsh, and an area within Great Kimble is called Smokey Row.
It comprises the ancient ecclesiastical parishes of Great Kimble and Little Kimble and also the medieval Manors which had the same names. The two separate parishes were amalgamated in 1885, but kept their separate churches, St Nicholas for Great Kimble and All Saints for Little Kimble. They fell within the Hundred of Stone, which was originally one of the Three Hundreds of Aylesbury, later amalgamated into Aylesbury Hundred. The parishes lie between Monks Risborough and Ellesborough and, like other parishes on the north side of the Chilterns, were strip parishes, long and narrow, including a section of the scarp and extending into the vale below. In length the combined parish extends for about [tpl]convert|4+1/4|mi|km[/tpl] from near the Bishopstone Road beyond Marsh to the far end of Pulpit Wood near the road from Great Missenden to Chequers but it is only a mile wide at the widest point. The village of Great Kimble lies about [tpl]convert|5.5|mi|km|abbr=off[/tpl] south of Aylesbury and about [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|km|abbr=off[/tpl] from Princes Risborough on the A4010 road.
There is a prehistoric hillfort at the summit of Pulpit Hill in Great Kimble. During the Roman occupation of Britain there was a Roman villa at Little Kimble and a tumulus near Great Kimble church is probably a burial mound from the same period. In Norman times a motte and bailey castle was erected at Little Kimble and later developed into a moated site for a medieval dwellinghouse. The present churches of St Nicholas (Great Kimble) and All Saints (Little Kimble) date from the 13th century. It was here that John Hampden refused to pay his ship-money in 1635, one of the incidents whch led to the English Civil War.

The New York/New Jersey Hitmen (later shortened simply to the New Jersey Hitmen) were a short-lived American football team based in Giants Stadium of the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
This team was part of the failed XFL begun by Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation and by NBC, a major television network in the United States.  Its general manager was former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, and New Jersey native, Drew Pearson. 
They were part of the Eastern Division with the Birmingham Thunderbolts, Orlando Rage and Chicago Enforcers. They finished in 3rd place with a 4-6 record. The head coach was former NFL assistant Rusty Tillman, who was not a fan of the league's gimmicks or personalities - specifically commentator Jesse Ventura, who called him "Gutless Rusty" on a regular basis, as he felt that Tilman's coaching style was too timid. Tillman, ever the professional, brushed off the jabs by Ventura and refused to respond. In the end, Ventura's attempts to goad him failed, and perhaps contributed to overall decline in viewers for NBC's XFL broadcasts.
NBC dropped the XFL concept after the first season 2001 due to dismal ratings, and the league folded shortly afterwards.
The name "Hitmen," which implies a hired criminal, was one of the icons of the XFL's short life and the butt of many jokes about the league (quips of teams such as the fictional "Kansas City Shoplifters" coined by Saturday Night Live, for instance). The teams secondary logo features the head of a football player wearing an old style leather football helmet.

Although he laughs off the existence of a "Gay Mafia" he says, "... fortunately, there are a lot of writers, like myself, who are slowly changing people’s minds by changing their hearts first."
He has been a member of the Council of the Dramatists Guild since 1970 and served as vice-president from 1981 to 2001.

Pedro Carrasco (Alosno, Spain, July 11, 1943 – Madrid, Spain, January 27, 2001) was a Spanish boxer whose fame transcended the boxing ring. During the 1970s, he was a media darling in Spain.
Carrasco was crowned European Lightweight champion in 1967. This triumph was followed four years later, in 1971, with a victory over Mando Ramos in Madrid by disqualification in 11 rounds for the WBC's world Lightweight title. The victory was marred by controversy because Carrasco won the title while lying on the canvas: he had been hit in the head by Ramos. The fight's referee expressed confusion as to whether the blow was legal, but he decided to call it an illegal blow and raised Carrasco's hand in signal of victory. Carrasco immediately became a national hero in Spain, as Spain's first-ever world boxing champion.
Carrasco, who was a culturally educated fighter, became a sensation with the media, especially with tabloid magazines, and he started to be seen with Spanish show business stars. His picture appeared on the covers of such magazines as ¡Hola! many times. He married the singer Rocío Jurado, with whom he had a daughter, Rocío Carrasco. He was also married to Raquel Mosquera for five years.
In 1971, and because of the controversial nature of his world championship win over Ramos, the WBC ordered a rematch, and it was fought in Los Angeles. There, Ramos beat Carrasco and retook title. They had another rematch, and Ramos beat Carrasco again.
Carrasco's career boxing record was 106-3-2 (66 KOs). After beginning his career 12-1-1, Carrasco had a streak on which he went 92-0-1. The draw came after Carrasco had won 83 consecutive fights. This undefeated streak was longer than Julio César Chávez's (90-0-1). Chávez's streak, however, was from the beginning of the career, and he was 87-0 before the draw.
In 1983, the WBC selected Carrasco in their list of 40 greatest boxers of the last 40 years.

[[Simpson Chain]]

CATEGORIES: Bicycle drivetrains

The Simpson Chain or Simpson Lever Chain was an English-made bicycle chain invented by William Spears Simpson in 1895. The design departed from the standard roller bicycle chain: it was composed of linked triangles forming two levels. The inner level was driven by the chainring and the outer drove the rear cog. Instead of teeth, the chainring and cog had grooves into which the rollers of the chain engaged.
Simpson made claims, widely discredited, that the levers of this chain provided a mechanical advantage that could amplify energy produced by the cyclist. Simpson hired top cyclists such as Constant Huret (depicted in Toulouse-Lautrec's advertisementBabylon Wales - May 14, 2006,  Toulouse-Lautrec and the Welsh Cyclist by Anthony Brockway - Image of Poster and notes on Jimmy Michael) and Tom Linton (of Paris-Bordeaux fame), and the Gladiator Pacing Team from France to race for high stakes in England for the Chain Matches. His teams were largely successful.
Jimmy Michael attended the so-called Chain Race at Catford track in 1896. Simpson was so insistent that it was an improvement over conventional chains that he staked part of his fortune on it.
Pryor Dodge wrote:
 In the fall of 1895, Simpson offered ten-to-one odds that riders with his chain would beat cyclists with regular chains. Later known as the Chain Matches, these races at the Catford track in London attracted huge crowds estimated between twelve and twenty thousand in June 1896. Simpson's team not only included the top racers - Tom Linton, Jimmy Michael, and Constant Huret - but also the Gladiator pacing team brought over from Paris. Pacers enabled a racer to ride faster by shielding him from air resistance. Although Simpson won the Chain Matches, they only proved that the Gladiator pacers were superior to their English rivals.Dodge, Pryor (1996), The Bicycle, Flammarion, France 
Crowds up to 20 000 attended the Chain RacesThe Bicycle, UK, 19 July 1944 and "Simpson v was an argument to be heard where cyclists foregathered."
Bill Mills of The Bicycle recalled: "All the events were distance races, with multi-cycle pacing. This was the heyday of pacing, when the famous Dunlop team of quads and triplets was available. Dunlops arranged the pacing for the plain chain men, and turned out some 80 riders and £2 000-worth of pacing machines. Simpson's brought over the Gladiator team of pacemakers from Paris, consisting of 12 assorted quads and quints bicycles and several triplets."
When the 1890s cycling boom ended, the Simpson Lever Chain company collapsed spectacularly, under the stewardship of the notorious entrepreneur and financier Ernest Terah Hooley, who had earlier acquired the rights to the chain from Simpson. The company was ultimately wound up in 1898, prompting the first of Hooley's four bankruptcies.Philip McCouat, "Toulouse-Lautrec, bicycling and the women's movement", Journal of Art in Society, http://www.artinsociety.com/toulouse-lautrec-the-bicycle-and-the-women's-movement.html

A 1991 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that promoters of MVAH failed to disclose financial incentives when they submitted a letter for publication and that their marketing practices were misleading. A 2008 study published in JAMA reported that two of the 19 Maharishi Ayurveda products tested contained heavy metals. A 1991 British case found two physicians guilty of "serious professional misconduct" for using MVAH in the unsuccessful treatment of HIV.

Together with the earlier September Dossier, these documents were ultimately used by the government to justify its involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

The most notable source was an article by then graduate student Ibrahim al-Marashi, entitled Iraq's Security and Intelligence Network: A Guide and Analysis,[tpl]cite journal |last=al-Marashi |first=Ibrahim |authorlink=Ibrahim al-Marashi |date=September 2002 |title=Iraq's Security and Intelligence Network: A Guide and Analysis |journal=Middle East Review of International Affairs |volume=6 |issue=3 |publisher=Global Research in International Affairs Center (GLORIA) |location=Herzliya, Israel |format=PDF |url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue3/al-marashi.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030404134044/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue3/al-marashi.pdf |archivedate=2003-04-04[/tpl]
Whole sections of Marashi's writings on "Saddam's Special Security Organisation" were repeated verbatim including typographical errors, while certain amendments were made to strengthen the tone of the alleged findings (e.g., "monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq" became "spying on foreign embassies in Iraq", and "aiding opposition groups in hostile regimes" became "supporting terrorist organisations in hostile regimes").
In its opening paragraph the briefing document claimed that it drew "upon a number of sources, including intelligence material." Before the document's release it had been praised by Tony Blair and United States Secretary of State Colin Powell as further intelligence and quality research.[tpl]cite news |title=Iraq dossier 'solid' - Downing Street |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2735031.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=7 February 2003 |accessdate=2013-06-07[/tpl] The day after Channel 4's exposé, Blair's office issued a statement admitting that a mistake was made in not crediting its sources, but did not concede that the quality of the document's content was affected.
The claims contained in the 'September' and 'Iraq' Dossiers were called into question when weapons of mass destruction (WMD) were not found in Iraq, and the dossiers were encompassed by House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee inquiry. The Committee subsequently reported that the sources should have been credited, and that the dossier should have been checked by ministers before being released. The dossier had only been reviewed by a group of civil servants operating under Alastair Campbell. The committee stated that the publication was "almost wholly counter-productive" and in the event only served to undermine the credibility of the government's case.
The controversy over the Iraq Dossier was mentioned frequently in the government's conflict with the BBC over the claim in the September Dossier that Iraq could deploy biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so, and the controversy surrounding the death of Dr. David Kelly. Andrew Gilligan, the BBC journalist who wrote a report which claimed that the September Dossier had been deliberately exaggerated, stated before the Hutton Inquiry that recalling the February Dossier had led him to file his report based on his interview with Dr. Kelly without seeking confirmation from other sources. Whether or not the September Dossier was inconsistent with the original intelligence, it was altered in ways that made it inconsistent with itself.[tpl]cite journal |last=Williams |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Williams (academic) |date=11 November 2011 |title=Learning to Redress Preemptive Deceit: The 'Iraq Dossier' |journal=SAGE Open |volume=1 |issue=3 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.1177/2158244011427060 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/1/3/2158244011427060.full |accessdate=2013-06-07[/tpl] Based on analysis submitted to the Iraq Inquiry.

"Colonia Agrippina". 
A colony for Roman veterans was founded in 50 AD under the patronage of Agrippa’s granddaughter, Agrippina the Younger,Tacitus, Annales 12.27.1-2. who herself had been born at Ara Ubiorum, the capital of the Ubii. The colony derived its title from the names of Agrippina and her husband, the emperor Claudius, and received the name Colonia Claudia Ara Augusta Agrippinensium, which is the origin of the city’s modern name Cologne. Alongside the allotment of land to veterans, the existing town of Ara Ubiorum was elevated to the status of a colonia, which would have conferred many privileges on the inhabitants.Barrett, Anthony A. (1996). Agrippina: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Early Empire, New Haven and London: Yale. The Ubii were also at Bonna (Bonn) of the Eburones.
The Ubii remained loyal allies of Rome; they were instrumental in crushing the Batavian rebellion in 70 and, although some of them made part of the invasion of Pannonia in 166, they become foederati supporting Roman troops in the Marcomannic Wars in 166-67. 
They seem to have been so thoroughly Romanized that they adopted the name Agrippenses in honour of their "founder",Tacitus, Germania c.28 and Histories, iv.28 (as noted in Smith, loc. cit.). and their later history is submerged with other Franks in that of eastern Gaul as a whole.

José Efraín Ríos Montt ([tpl]IPA-es|efɾaˈin ˈri.os ˈmont[/tpl]; born June 16, 1926) is a Guatemalan politician who was President of Guatemala from 1982 to 1983. An army general, his time in office was marked by the Guatemalan Civil War. Years later, he served as president of Congress.
A general in the Guatemalan Army, Ríos Montt came to public office through a coup d'état on March 23, 1982. In turn, he was overthrown by his Defense Minister, Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores, in another coup d'état on August 8, 1983. In the 2003 presidential elections, he unsuccessfully ran as the candidate of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG). In 2007 Ríos Montt returned to public office as a member of Congress, gaining prosecutorial immunity, including from a pair of long-running lawsuits alleging war crimes against him and a number of his former ministers and counselors during their term in the presidential palace in 1982-83.accessed Oct. 19, 2012Accessed Oct. 19, 2012 His immunity ended on January 14, 2012, when his term in office ran out. On January 26, 2012 Ríos Montt appeared in court in Guatemala and was formally indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity.[tpl]cite journal |last=Doyle |first=Kate |date=Spring 2012 |title=Justice in Guatemala |url=https://nacla.org/sites/default/files/A04501039_10.pdf |journal=NACLA Report on the Americas |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=37–42 |accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl]
Huehuetenango-born Ríos Montt remains one of the most controversial figures in Guatemala. Two Truth Commissions, the REMHI report, sponsored by the Roman Catholic Church, and the CEH report, conducted by the United Nations as part of the 1996 Accords of Firm and Durable Peace, documented widespread human rights abuses committed by Ríos Montt's military regime, including widespread massacres, rape, torture, and acts of genocide against the indigenous population. Supporters maintain that there was no genocide, just a bloody civil war.[tpl]cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/10/world/americas/guatemala-genocide-trial/index.html | work=CNN | title=Guatemala's Rios Montt guilty of genocide - CNN.com | date=May 13, 2013[/tpl] Ríos Montt, at times, had close ties to the United States, receiving direct and indirect support from certain of its agencies, including the CIA.[tpl]cite news|last=Farah|first=Douglas|title=War Study Censures Military in Guatemala|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/feb99/guatemala26.htm|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=29 January 2013|date=February 27, 1999[/tpl]
Ríos Montt is best known outside Guatemala for being tried for heading a military regime (1982–1983) that was partly responsible for having defeated the guerrillas through the "guns and beans" campaign, maintaining "If you are with us, we’ll feed you, if not, we’ll kill you".[tpl]cite web|last=Kozloff|first=Nikolas|title=Rev.

The civil war pitted Marxist rebels against the Guatemalan state, including the army, with huge numbers of civilians, both indigenous Mayas and mestizo Ladinos, caught in the crossfire. Up to 200,000 Guatemalans were killed and missing during the conflict, making it one of Latin America's most violent wars in modern history.
Indigenous Mayas suffered disproportionately during Ríos Montt's rule, and it is documented that his government deliberately targeted thousands of indigenous people since many were suspected of harboring sympathies for, supporting, or participating in the guerrilla movement. Under the Cold War-era strategy of containment the Guatemalan state sought to eliminate the spread of communism inside its borders. The UN-backed Historical Clarification Commission found that the resulting counterinsurgency campaign, significantly designed and advanced during Ríos Montt's presidency, included deliberate "acts of genocide" against the indigenous population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/english/conc2.html |title=Guatemala: Memory of Silence, Report of the Commission for Historical Clarification |publisher=Shr.aaas.org |accessdate=February 7, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://alertanet.org/verdad.html |title=Comision Verdad |publisher=Alertanet |accessdate=February 7, 2012[/tpl]

[[Mixin]]

CATEGORIES: Object-oriented programming languages

In object-oriented programming languages, a mixin is a class which contains a combination of methods from other classes. How such combination is done depends on the language, but it is not by inheritance. If a combination contains all methods of combined classes it is equivalent to multiple inheritance.
Mixins encourage code reuse and avoid well-known pathologies associated with multiple inheritance.[tpl]cite book|last=Boyland|first=John|title=ECOOP '96, Object-oriented Programming: 10th European Conference|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540614395|pages=16–17|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sGvtaGy8SJ8C&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=pathologies+of+multiple+inheritance&source=bl&ots=sF3Ah-XZSq&sig=JG7VV5hrjm781yqT5iGHSnlLI0I&hl=en&ei=Obi-TuLMCebV0QHD9bnyBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|coauthors=Guiseppe Castagna|editor=Pierre Cointe|accessdate=17 January 2014|chapter=Type-Safe Compilation of Covariant Specialization: A Practical Case|date=26 June 1996[/tpl]
A mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods. When a class includes a mixin, the class implements the interface and includes, rather than inherits, all the mixin's attributes (fields, properties) and methods. They become part of the class during compilation. Mixins don't need to implement an interface. The advantage of implementing an interface is that in statically typed languages instances of the class may be passed as parameters to methods requiring that interface.
A mixin can defer definition and binding of methods until runtime, though attributes and instantiation parameters are still defined at compile time.  This differs from the most widely used approach (which originated in the programming language Simula) of defining all attributes, methods and initialization at compile time.

Pinckney's Treaty, also known as the Treaty of San Lorenzo or the Treaty of Madrid, was signed in San Lorenzo de El Escorial on October 27, 1795 and established intentions of friendship between the United States and Spain. It also defined the boundaries of the United States with the Spanish colonies and guaranteed the United States navigation rights on the Mississippi River. The treaty's full title is Treaty of Friendship, Limits, and Navigation Between Spain and the United States. Thomas Pinckney negotiated the treaty for the United States and Don Manuel de Godoy represented Spain. Among other things, it ended the first phase of the West Florida Controversy, a dispute between the two nations over the boundaries of the Spanish colony of West Florida.
The treaty was presented to the United States Senate on February 26, 1796 and after several weeks of debate was ratified on March 7, 1796. It was ratified by Spain on April 25, 1796 and ratifications were exchanged on that date. The treaty was proclaimed on August 3, 1796.

Angels of Light are an American experimental group that was formed circa 1998 by singer/guitarist Michael Gira after he disbanded Swans, the group he had founded in 1982.  The band has marked a distinctly different style for Gira since he left Swans, most noticeably being musically more melodic and less brutal than his previous efforts.
Before the band was formed, Gira intended to call his post-Swans acoustic/song-based project The Pleasure Seekers. This name was discarded because there had been a group with the same name in the 1960s.  The first two live performances of what would become the Angels of Light (the Tonic/Bowery Ballroom benefit shows) were billed as "Michael Gira with guests".
Angels of Light include many New York City collaborators, including Dana Schechter of Bee and Flower, Kid Congo Powers of The Cramps, Larry Mullins (aka Toby Dammit), Cassis Birgit Staudt of b-blush, Bliss Blood of The Moonlighters, Thor Harris of Shearwater, and most recently the Brooklyn band Akron/Family as well as Berlin-based Swans guitarist Christoph Hahn and freak-folk musician Devendra Banhart.
All Angels of Light albums have been released on Michael Gira's label Young God Records.

Ābu Ḥanīfah Āḥmad ibn Dawūd Dīnawarī (828–896 A.D) ([tpl]lang-ar|أبو حنيفة الدينوري[/tpl]) was a Muslim polymath excelling as much in astronomy, agriculture, botany and metallurgy and  as he did in geography, mathematics and history.  He was born in the region of Dinawar, halfway between Hamadan and Kermanshah in modern-day western Iran. He studied astronomy, mathematics and mechanics in Isfahan and philology and poetry in Kufa and Basra. He died on July 24, 896 at Dinawar. His most renowned contribution is Book of Plants, for which he is considered the founder of Arabic botany. He also wrote a book on the ancestry of the Kurds titled Ansab al-Akrad. There is no consensus regarding his ethnic background among scholars. Ludwig Adamec considers him to be of Kurdish descent, while Encyclopedia of Islam classifies him as an Arab philologist and scientist, however, Encyclopaedia Iranica lists him as Persian.

She originally entered British Army service in 1968, managed for the Ministry of Transport by British India Steam Navigation Company, but was taken over by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary along with the other members of the class in 1970. The first twelve years of the ship's life were quiet, with some time spent in the Pacific, until the Falklands War broke out in April 1982. Along with all the Navy's other amphibious assault shipping, Sir Percivale went south to participate in the recapture of the Falkland Islands. She pioneered the supply runs to Teal Inlet and was the first British ship to re-enter Stanley Harbour. Unlike the Sir Galahad, Sir Tristram and Sir Lancelot, the ship emerged unscathed from the conflict.
The ship also served in the Gulf War in 1991 and twice deployed to the Adriatic to support British operations in the Balkans. In 1996 Sir Percivale took part in combined exercises with Jordan, followed by Green Wader 96, the first exercise of the then newly formed Amphibious Squadron of the Joint Rapid Deployment Force. In 1997, the ship took part in the large Ocean Wave 97 deployment to the far east and was present for the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese. Following this ceremony, Sir Percivale escorted the ships of the former Hong Kong Squadron (3 Peacock class patrol vessel) to their new owners in the Philippines. During other parts of Ocean Wave, the ship took Royal Marines to Brunei, Singapore and Thailand for various exercises. 1998 saw further exercises as Sir Percivale took part in practice amphibious assaults in Norway, France and Spain.
In 2000, Sir Percivale was deployed to Sierra Leone to support British forces training the army of that country. In September 2000, the ship was alongside in Freetown when British forces who had been taken hostage were rescued in a raid by the Parachute Regiment and the SAS ("Operation Barras"). Since then the ship has been deployed during operations connected with Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.
The ship was to have a SLEP overhaul, but an equivalent overhaul of Sir Bedivere proved so costly that plans were abandoned and new ships were procured instead.
Sir Percivale was decommissioned on 17 August 2004 and was laid up alongside at Marchwood Military Port, Southampton.  Sir Percivale remained at the Sea Mounting Centre (SMC) until 0058hrs, 13 December 2009 when she was towed to Liverpool for scrapping.Daily Mail (31 August 2010) 2010: End of an era: Twenty-eight years after being the first ship to claim British victory in Falklands RFA Sir Percivale is dismantled

CATEGORIES: 12th-century births, 1206 deaths, 12th-century Byzantine bishops, 13th-century Byzantine bishops, Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople, Kamateros family

John X Kamateros ([tpl]lang-el|Ἰωάννης Καματηρός[/tpl]) was the Patriarch of Constantinople from 5 August 1198 to April/May 1206.
John was a member of the Kamateros family, to which belonged the Empress Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera, wife of Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203). An educated man, well versed in classical literature, rhetoric and philosophy, he occupied a series of ecclesiastical posts reaching the post of chartophylax, which he held at the time of his elevation to the patriarchal throne.Kazhdan (1991), p. 1054
In 1198–1200 he had an exchange of letters with Pope Innocent III on the issue of papal supremacy and the filioque clause. Notably, he disputed Rome's claim to primacy based on St Peter, and asserted that in reality its primacy came from the fact that Rome was the old imperial capital.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1054–1055 He intervened in the riots in Constantinople against the arrest of the banker Kalomodios, and secured his release,Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1055, 1096 but during the coup of John Komnenos the Fat on 31 July 1200, he hid in a cupboard as the rebels seized control of the Hagia Sophia.
John remained in office after Alexios III's deposition in July 1203, and according to Western sources, both he and Alexios IV Angelos, threatened by the Fourth Crusade, acknowledged papal supremacy in the same year. After the capture of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, he initially fled to Didymoteichon in Thrace. In 1206, Theodore I Laskaris invited him to Nicaea, where he had established the Empire of Nicaea, a Byzantine Greek successor state, but John refused, perhaps because of his advanced age, and died in April or May of the same year.Kazhdan (1991), p. 1055
The Crusaders then installed a Latin Patriarch in Constantinople, while Theodore simply created a new Greek Patriarchate in Nicaea, which was eventually restored in Constantinople with the rest of the Empire in 1261.

[[President of Guatemala]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of presidents, Presidents of Guatemala, Guatemala-related lists

The President of Guatemala (Spanish: Presidente de Guatemala), is the head of state and head of government of Guatemala. The title of "President of Guatemala" has been the usual title of the leader of Guatemala since 1839, when that title was assumed by Mariano Rivera Paz. Earlier, Guatemala had been a state within the United Provinces of Central America since 1823, before that part of the First Mexican Empire under Agustín de Iturbide, and before 1821 ruled by the Captain General of Guatemala, a Spanish colonial official owing allegiance to the Viceroy of New Spain and the King of Spain, back to the Spanish conquest of the region in the early 16th century.
The title of "President" has been used by democratically elected leaders and appointed heads of state, as well as by dictators who took power by military coup.

American Antinquity 41 (2): 154-167.

[[Bruun's FFT algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: FFT algorithms

Bruun's algorithm is a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm based on an unusual recursive polynomial-factorization approach, proposed for powers of two by G. Bruun in 1978 and generalized to arbitrary even composite sizes by H. Murakami in 1996. Because its operations involve only real coefficients until the last computation stage, it was initially proposed as a way to efficiently compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of real data. Bruun's algorithm has not seen widespread use, however, as approaches based on the ordinary Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm have been successfully adapted to real data with at least as much efficiency. Furthermore, there is evidence that Bruun's algorithm may be intrinsically less accurate than Cooley–Tukey in the face of finite numerical precision  (Storn, 1993).
Nevertheless, Bruun's algorithm illustrates an alternative algorithmic framework that can express both itself and the Cooley–Tukey algorithm, and thus provides an interesting perspective on FFTs that permits mixtures of the two algorithms and other generalizations.

José María Reina Barrios (24 December 1854, San Marcos – 8 February 1898) was President of Guatemala from 15 March 1892 through 8 February 1898. He was born in San Marcos, Guatemala. He was nicknamed Reinita, the diminutive form, because of his short stature.
He was a moderate of Guatemala's Liberal Party, who worked to solidify the less controversial of the reforms of late president Justo Rufino Barrios. The power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased during his presidency.  He oversaw rebuilding of parts of Guatemala City on a grander scale, with some wide avenues built on the model of those of Paris.  He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first Central American Exposition in 1897. He printed paper currency to fund his ambitious plans, resulting in monetary inflation and rise of popular opposition to his regime.
José María Reina was assassinated on 8 February 1898,[tpl]cite book |editor-last=Hammerton |editor-first=J.

Manuel José Estrada Cabrera (21 November 1857 – 24 September 1924) was President of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920. He was a strong ruler, who modernised the country’s industry and transport, but only by granting concessions to the American-owned United Fruit Company, whose influence on the government was felt by many to be excessive. Cabrera used increasingly brutal methods to assert his authority, including armed strike-breaking, and the general elections were effectively controlled by him. He was eventually removed from office when the national assembly declared him mentally incompetent, and he was jailed for corruption.

CATEGORIES: New Zealand rock music groups

Fur Patrol is a rock band, originally from Wellington, New Zealand, now based in Melbourne, Australia.
Their debut EP, Starlifter, was released on the independent Wellington label Wishbone in 1998. Their debut album Pet was produced by David Long, guitarist of the Six Volts and the The Mutton Birds and was released in 2000, also on Wishbone Records. Pet  featured the single "Lydia" which reached number one on the New Zealand singles charts. The band scooped the pool at the 2001 Tui New Zealand Music Awards, walking away with four Tuis.
In 2001 the band moved to Melbourne, Australia where they inked their first major record deal, with Universal Music Australia. Their second album, Collider, was released in New Zealand in 2003 and Australia in early 2004. The album, produced by British producer Mark Wallis and recorded in Melbourne's Sing Sing studios, was a move away from the catchy, more radio-friendly pop sound of Pet. The first single, Precious, was heavier and darker than earlier offerings. Its music video, which showed the band members collecting fan's ears, was filmed in Hollywood.
Fur Patrol became a three-piece when Guitarist Steve Wells left the band in late 2004. Steve shifted to France to pursue a career as a photographer.
The 3-piece released the 4-track Long Distance Runner EP in May 2007 and their third full-length album Local Kid on 29 September 2008. Local Kid was produced by Australian producer Tony Cohen.

[[Weakly compact cardinal]]

CATEGORIES: Large cardinals

In mathematics, a weakly compact cardinal is a certain kind of cardinal number introduced by [tpl]harvtxt|Erdős|Tarski|1961[/tpl]; weakly compact cardinals are large cardinals, meaning that their existence can not be proven  from the standard axioms of set theory.
Formally, a cardinal κ is defined to be weakly compact if it is uncountable and for every function f: κ  2  → {0, 1} there is a set of cardinality κ that is homogeneous for f.  In this context, κ  2  means the set of 2-element subsets of κ, and a subset S of κ is homogeneous for f if and only if either all of S2 maps to 0 or all of it maps to 1.
The name "weakly compact" refers to the fact that if a cardinal is weakly compact then a certain related infinitary language satisfies a version of the compactness theorem; see below. 
Weakly compact cardinals are Mahlo cardinals, and the set of Mahlo cardinals less than a given weakly compact cardinal is stationary.
Some authors use a weaker definition of weakly compact cardinals, such as one of the conditions below with the condition of inaccessibility dropped.

The state flag of Moldova is a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow, and red, charged with the coat of arms of Moldova (an eagle holding a shield charged with an aurochs) on the center bar. The obverse is mirrored. The flag ratio is 1:2. Until further provisions, the State Flag of Moldova is used as the national flag and ensign as well, that is, civil, state and war flag and ensign.Law no. 217 from 17 September 2010 regarding the State Flag of the Republic of Moldovaflags.net, Flag of Republic of Moldova
The blue, red, and yellow tricolor of Moldova is almost identical to the flag of Romania, reflecting the two countries' national and cultural affinity. On Moldova's flag the yellow stripe is charged with the national arms. Like the Romanian coat of arms, the Moldovan arms, adopted in 1990, features a dark golden eagle holding an Orthodox Christian cross in its beak. Instead of a sword, the eagle is holding an olive branch, symbolizing peace. The blue and red shield on the eagle's chest is charged with the traditional symbols of Moldova: an aurochs' head, flanked by a rose at dexter and a crescent at senester, and having a star between its horns, all of gold. These two national flags are also very similar to the flags of Chad and Andorra, which are all based on vertical stripes of blue, yellow, and red.

a system. The number of components represents the minimum number of independent species necessary to define the composition of all phases of the system.Peter Atkins and Julio de Paula, "Physical Chemistry" 8th Edition (W.H. Freeman 2006), p.175-176
Calculating the number of components in a system is necessary, for example, when applying Gibbs' phase rule in determination of the number of degrees of freedom of a system.
The number of components is equal to the number of distinct chemical species (constituents), minus the number of chemical reactions between them, minus the number of any constraints (like charge neutrality or balance of molar quantities).

These include the nature of God, the soul and prophetic knowledge.Adamson, p34 But despite the important role he played in making philosophy accessible to Muslim intellectuals, his own philosophical output was largely overshadowed by that of al-Farabi and very few of his texts are available for modern scholars to examine.

Dey (Arabic: داي, from Turkish Dayı Merriam-Webster Online - DeyDictionary.com - Dey) was the title given to the rulers of the Regency of Algiers (Algeria) and Tripoli Bertarelli (1929), p. 203. under the Ottoman Empire from 1671 onwards. Twenty-nine deys held office from the establishment of the deylicate in Algeria until the French conquest in 1830.
The dey was chosen by local civilian, military, and religious leaders to govern for life and ruled with a high degree of autonomy from the Ottoman sultan. The main sources of his revenues were taxes on the agricultural population, religious tributes, and protection payments rendered by Corsairs, regarded as pirates who preyed on Mediterranean shipping.
The dey was assisted in governing by a divan (ديوان) made up of the Chiefs of the Army and Navy, the Director of Shipping, the Treasurer-General and the Collector of Tributes.
The realm of the dey of Alger (Algiers) was divided into three provinces (Constantine, Titteri and Mascara), each of which was administered by a bey (باي) whom he appointed.
The rule of the deys of Alger came to an end on 5 July 1830, when Hussein Dey (1765–1838) surrendered to invading French forces.
The last Dey of Tripoli was killed by Ahmed Karamanli, who established the eponymous Karamanli dynasty in 1711.Bertarelli (1929), p. 204.

Hutchinson was born in Carsington, Wirksworth, Derbyshire, the second son of Mary and Edward Hutchinson or Hitchinson (a family of the lesser landed gentry). He was taught history by his uncle, Francis Tallents, a Puritan clergyman, before beginning his studies at Katharine Hall, Cambridge at the age of 18. He graduated B.A. in 1681 and M.A. in 1684,[tpl]acad|id=HTCN677F|name=Hutchinson, Francis[/tpl] a year after he was ordained by the bishop of London and was appointed Lecturer at the rectory of Widdington, Essex. This living represented the lowest rung of the career ladder of the Church of England and Hutchinson remained there until appointed vicar of Hoxne, Suffolk in early 1690 by local Whig magnate, William Maynard[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl].  Hutchinson wrote "Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft," whose second edition appeared in 1720 with a chapter attacking the witch-hunting in Salem, Massachusetts, in the 1690s by debunking the charge of witchcraft.
He studied several cases of witchcraft and witch trials, criticising some procedures.  For example, he opposed the idea that children and young teenagers acted as accusers in cases of bewitching after having reached the conclusion that they feigned demon possession and several innocents had died for that reason, and wrote a book that ended the persecution of witches in England.

Jean Bodin (1530–1596) was a French jurist and political philosopher, member of the Parlement of Paris and professor of law in Toulouse. He is best known for his theory of sovereignty; he was also an influential writer on demonology.
Bodin lived during the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation and wrote against the background of religious conflict in France. He remained a nominal Catholic throughout his life but was critical of papal authority over governments, favouring the strong central control of a national monarchy as an antidote to factional strife. Toward the end of his life he wrote, but did not publish, a dialogue among different religions, including representatives of Judaism, Islam and natural theology, in which all agreed to coexist in concord.

[[In-band on-channel]]

CATEGORIES: Radio terminology

In-band on-channel (IBOC) is a hybrid method of transmitting digital radio and analog radio broadcast signals simultaneously on the same frequency.
By utilizing additional digital subcarriers or sidebands, digital information is "multiplexed" on an AM or FM analog signal, thus avoiding re-allocation of the broadcast bands.  However, by putting RF energy outside of the normally-defined channel, interference to adjacent channel stations is increased when using digital sidebands.
IBOC does allow for multiple program channels, though this can entail taking some existing subcarriers off the air to make additional bandwidth available in the modulation baseband. On FM, this could eventually mean removing stereo. On AM, IBOC is incompatible with analog stereo, and any additional channels are limited to highly compressed voice, such as traffic and weather. Eventually, stations can go from hybrid mode (both analog and digital) to all-digital, by eliminating the baseband monophonic audio.

A field of applied statistics, survey methodology studies the sampling of individual units from a population and the associated survey data collection techniques, such as questionnaire construction and methods for improving the number and accuracy of responses to surveys.
Statistical surveys are undertaken with a view towards making statistical inferences about the population being studied, and this depends strongly on the survey questions used.  Polls about public opinion, public health surveys, market research surveys, government surveys and censuses are all examples of quantitative research that use contemporary survey methodology to answer questions about a population. Although censuses do not include a "sample", they do include other aspects of survey methodology, like questionnaires, interviewers, and nonresponse follow-up techniques. Surveys provide important information for  all kinds of public information and research fields, e.g., marketing research, psychology, health professionals and sociology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whatisasurvey.info/ |title=WhatIsASurvey.info |publisher=WhatIsASurvey.info |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Types of drinking establishment

A tavern is a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and be served food, and in some cases, where travelers receive lodging. An inn is a tavern which has a license to put up guests as lodgers. The word derives from the Latin taberna whose original meaning was a shed, workshop, stall, or pub.
In the English language, a tavern was once an establishment which served wine whilst an inn served beer and ale. Over time, the words "tavern" and "inn" became interchangeable and synonymous. In England, inns started to be referred to as public houses or pubs and the term became standard for all drinking houses.

[[Bar (establishment)]]

CATEGORIES: Types of drinking establishment, Bartending

A bar is a retail business establishment that serves alcoholic drinks —  beer, wine, liquor, and cocktails — for consumption on the premises.Cocktail Lounge definition from The Free Dictionary
Bars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, go-go dancers, or strippers. Bars which offer entertainment or live music are often referred to as music bars or nightclubs.
Types of bars range from dive bars[ref]Todd Dayton, 
[/ref] to elegant places of entertainment for the elite.
Many bars have a happy hour to encourage off-peak patronage. Bars that fill to capacity sometimes implement a cover charge or a minimum purchase requirement during their peak hours. Such bars often feature entertainment, which may be a live band or a disc jockey playing recorded music.
The term "bar" is derived from the specialized counter on which drinks are served. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the bartender, or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers. The "back bar" is a set of shelves of glasses and bottles behind that counter.  In some establishments, the back bar is elaborately decorated with woodwork, etched glass, mirrors, and lights.

[[DAB ensemble]]
CATEGORIES: Broadcast engineering, Digital radio, DAB ensemble

DAB ensembles are groups of Digital audio broadcasting broadcasters transmitting multiple digital radio channels on a single radio transmission.
The digital audio feeds from each radio station are multiplexed into one digital transmission, to be decoded by the receiver.  While each station can use a different bitrate, and either monophonic or stereophonic (one or two channels of audio), all stations will have exactly the same coverage area.  Each ensemble can only have a certain maximum total bitrate, a sort of "bit budget" that participating broadcasters must work within.  Increasing the number of stations on an ensemble requires lower quality audio, whilst increasing audio quality requires removing audio channels.
The digital television equivalent is called a multiplex, though in some parts of the world, TV stations use a full channel for their own programming (one HDTV or multiplexed SDTV) and do not share with other stations.  For example in the U.S., a private television station is assigned 6 megahertz exclusively, to be divided at its own discretion (WBAL 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, et cetera).

[[Bit rate]]

In telecommunications and computing, bit rate (sometimes written bitrate or as a variable R[tpl]cite book |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=-kNn_p6WA38C&pg=PA21&dq=bit+%22rate+R%22#v=onepage&q=bit%20%22rate%20R%22&f=false |title=Data Communications and Computer Networks | first =Prakash C | last = Gupta |publisher=PHI Learning |year= 2006 |accessdate=2011-07-10[/tpl]) is the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time.
The bit rate is quantified using the bits per second (bit/s or bps) unit, often in conjunction with an SI prefix such as kilo- (kbit/s or kbps), mega- (Mbit/s or Mbps), giga- (Gbit/s or Gbps) or tera- (Tbit/s or Tbps). Note that, unlike many other computer-related units, 1 kbit/s is traditionally defined as 1,000 bit/s, not 1,024 bit/s, etc., also before 1999 when SI prefixes were introduced for units of information in the standard IEC 60027-2.[tpl]cite web | author= International Electrotechnical Commission | title= Prefixes for binary multiples | url= http://www.iec.ch/si/binary.htm | date= 2007 | accessdate= 2014-02-04[/tpl] 
The symbol for "bits per second" is "bit/s" (not "bits/s", according to the writing style for SI units). In less formal contexts the abbreviations "b/s" or "bps" are sometimes used, though this risks confusion with "bytes per second" ("B/s", "Bps"), and the use of the abbreviation ps is also inconsistent with the SI symbol for picosecond. 
One byte per second (1 B/s) corresponds to 8 bit/s.

Brasstown Bald is the highest natural point in the state of Georgia, USA, with a summit elevation of 4,784 feet (1,458 m) above mean sea level.
The mountain is known to the native Cherokee people as Enotah.  It is named for the former Cherokee village of Brasstown, Georgia, located along the upper Brasstown Creek.  Across the North Carolina state line, immediately to its north, is Brasstown, North Carolina, in the Brasstown township of Clay County, North Carolina.
Brasstown Bald is partly in Towns and partly in Union counties, the peak being divided by the county line.  The mountain is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains (part of the Appalachian Mountains), and within the borders of the Blue Ridge Ranger District of the Chattahoochee National Forest.  The mountain is mostly made up of soapstone and dunite.
On a clear day, it is possible to see the tall buildings of Atlanta from the summit. The U.S. Forest Service has webcams atop the observation tower, and a RAWS weather station further down the mountain.  The public can drive to the top via Georgia state route 180 Spur.

CATEGORIES: 1858 births, 1923 deaths, Actors awarded British knighthoods, Alumni of Pembroke College, Oxford, English male stage actors, English theatre managers and producers, English male silent film actors, Knights Bachelor, People educated at Rugby School

Sir Charles Henry Hawtrey (21 September 1858 – 30 July 1923) was an English actor, director, producer and manager. He pursued a successful career as an actor-manager, specialising in debonair, often disreputable, parts in popular comedies. He occasionally played in Sheridan and other classics, but was generally associated with new works by writers including Oscar Wilde and Somerset Maugham.
Born to a long-established county family, Hawtrey was one of three of his parents' five sons to pursue a theatrical career. Before going on the stage he had considered joining the army, but failed to apply himself to the necessary studies to qualify for a commission. Once established as an actor he quickly took on the additional role of a manager, boosted by an early success with his own adaptation of a German farce presented in London as The Private Secretary, which made his fortune. A lifelong gambler, both with theatrical productions and on horseracing, to which he was addicted, he was bankrupted several times during his career.
Regarded as Britain's leading comedy actor of his generation, Hawtrey was mentor and role model to younger actors including Noël Coward. Towards the end of his career Hawtrey starred in a handful of silent movies.

The department is also responsible for international environmental issues (e.g., Canada-USA air issues). CEPA was the central piece of Canada's environmental legislation but was replaced when budget implementation bill (C-38) entered into effect in June 2012.http://www.osler.com/NewsResources/Federal-Government-Releases-Draft-Legislation-to-Reform-Federal-Regulatory-System/ "Federal Government Releases Draft Legislation to Reform Federal Regulatory System."[tpl]update after|2012|07[/tpl]
Under the Constitution of Canada, responsibility for environmental management in Canada is a shared responsibility between the federal government and provincial/territorial governments. For example, provincial governments have primary authority for resource management including permitting industrial waste discharges (e.g., to the air). The federal government is responsible for the management of toxic substances in the country (e.g., benzene). Environment Canada provides stewardship of the Environmental Choice Program, which provides consumers with an eco-labelling for products manufactured within Canada or services that meet international label standards of (GEN) Global Ecolabelling Network.
Environment Canada continues (2005–present) to undergo a structural transformation to centralize authority and decision-making, and to standardize policy implementation.

A PC bang  (Korean: PC방; literally "PC room") is a type of LAN gaming center, where patrons can play multiplayer computer games for an hourly fee. The typical cost for an hour of play ranges from 500 to 1500 won (approximately $0.44 to $1.32 USD.), with 1000 won per hour being the most common cost. Although the per capita penetration of computers and broadband internet access is very high in South Korea, PC bangs remain popular as they provide a social meeting place for gamers (especially school-aged gamers) to play together with their peers. The computer hardware used by PC bangs may be more powerful than the systems available in the players' homes.

The Abyssinia Crisis was a crisis during the interwar period originating in the "Walwal incident."  This incident resulted from the ongoing conflict between the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia) and the Empire of Ethiopia (then commonly known as "Abyssinia" in Europe).  Its effects were to undermine the credibility of the League of Nations and to encourage Fascist Italy to ally itself with Nazi Germany. The crisis brought an end to peace in Europe and it was clear by 1937 there were two defining sides in Europe.

(1972), Mechanics of Flight, Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London ISBN 0-273-31623-0
For most wings the length of the chord is not a constant but varies along the wing, so the aspect ratio AR is defined as the square of the wingspan b divided by the area S of the wing planform,Anderson, John D.

[[Effective radiated power]]

CATEGORIES: Antennas (radio), Power (physics), Broadcast engineering

In electromagnetic transmission systems, especially those dealing with telecommunications, effective radiated power or equivalent radiated power (ERP) is a standardized theoretical measurement of radio frequency (RF) energy[ref]
</ref><ref>
</ref> using the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit [[watt]]s, and is determined by subtracting system losses and adding system [[antenna gain|gain]]s.  ERP takes into consideration [[transmitter power output]] (TPO), [[transmission line]] [[attenuation]] ([[electrical resistance]] and [[RF radiation]]), [[RF connector]] [[insertion loss]]es, and [[directional antenna|antenna directivity]], but not [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT).  ERP is typically applied to [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] systems.  
For a simplified case, if an antenna system has 9 dBd gain and 6 dB loss, its ERP is 3 dB more than (equal to double) the TPO.  The use of circular polarization, or otherwise splitting equally between horizontal and vertical linear polarization, causes a "loss" of 3 dB, cutting the reported ERP in half.  If full-wavelength spacing is used between antenna elements in an array, the ERP is increased approximately in proportion to the number of elements.  When half-wave-spaced elements are used (to reduce RF radiation beneath the radio tower, or for other purposes), the increase is less.  Null fill also detracts from the ERP by increasing the power in the nulls that form between side lobes.  Stations with beam tilt often have two ERPs listed: one at the angle of tilt (the main lobe), and another in the standard horizontal plane. When only one ERP is listed, this is usually referring to the power in the main lobe.

[[Height above average terrain]]

CATEGORIES: Antennas, Broadcasting

Height above average terrain (HAAT) (or less popularly, EHAAT, Effective Height Above Average Terrain) is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape.  HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television, as it is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts (VHF and UHF in particular, as they are line of sight transmissions). For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico (both of which use metric) have extensive border zones where international stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see list of broadcast station classes for more information on this).
Before metrification at the FCC, the procedure to figure HAAT was relatively simple: from the proposed or actual antenna site, either 12 or 16 radials were drawn, and points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] radius along each radial were used. The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station.  The altitude of the antenna site, minus the average altitude of all the specified points, was the HAAT. This can create some unusual cases, particularly in mountainous regions—it is possible to have a negative number for HAAT (the transmitter would not be located underground, but rather in a valley, with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself, for example).
The FCC has divided the Continental United States into three zones for the determination of spacing between FM and TV stations using the same frequencies.  FM and TV stations are assigned maximum ERP and HAAT values, depending on their assigned zones, to prevent Co-channel interference.
The FCC regulations for ERP and HAAT are listed under Title 47, Part 73 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

[[Transmitter power output]]

CATEGORIES: Broadcast engineering, Power (physics), Wireless transmitters

In radio transmission, transmitter power output (TPO) is the actual amount of power (in watts) of radio frequency (RF) energy that a transmitter produces at its output.
This is not the amount of power that a radio station reports as its power, as in "we're 100,000 watts of rock 'n' roll", which is usually the effective radiated power (ERP). The TPO is  for VHF-/UHF-transmitters normally less than the ERP, for LF-/MF-transmitters it has nearly the same value, while for VLF-transmitters it may be less.
The radio antenna's design "focuses" the signal toward the horizon, creating gain and increasing the ERP. There is also some loss (negative gain) from the feedline, which reduces some of the TPO to the antenna by both resistance and by radiating a small part of the signal.
The basic equation relating transmitter to effective power is: 
Note that in this formula the Antenna Gain is expressed with reference to a tuned dipole (dBd)

[[FM broadcast band]]

CATEGORIES: Bandplans, Broadcast engineering, Radio modulation modes

The FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs between different parts of the world. In Europe and Africa (ITU region 1), it spans from 87.5 to 108.0 megahertz (MHz), while in the Americas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 87.9 to 107.9 MHz, though only two low power stations are licensed for 87.9 MHz; normal full power stations start at 88.1. The FM broadcast band in Japan uses 76.0 to 90 MHz. The OIRT band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these countries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of Russia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have changed to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band.
Frequency modulation radio originated in the United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American electrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not become widespread even in North America until the 1960s.
Frequency-modulated radio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this article are in the very high frequency (VHF) band, which extends from 30 to 300 MHz.
In some languages, the VHF band is referred to as "UKW"/"UKF" (from the German Ultrakurzwelle, Polish Ultra Krótkie Fale—"ultra short wave") or "УКВ" (from the Russian Ультракороткие волны).

The North London Line is London Overground's railway line which passes through the inner suburbs of north London, England. Its route is a rough semicircle from the south west to the north east, avoiding central London. The line is owned and maintained by Network Rail and London Overground. Although much of it originated as part of the North London Railway, the current route is the result of a series of amalgamations, closures and re-openings; and has a mixed third-rail and overhead electrical power supply. It is an important freight route and is used by the [tpl]LUL stations|station=Richmond[/tpl] to [tpl]LUL stations|station=Stratford[/tpl] service of the London Overground, as part of the National Rail network.

[[Stenosing tenosynovitis]]

CATEGORIES: Inflammations, Gross pathology, Soft tissue disorders

Stenosing tenosynovitis (also known as trigger finger or trigger thumb) is a painful condition caused by the inflammation (tenosynovitis) and progressive restriction of the superficial and deep flexors fibrous tendon sheath adjacent to the A1 pulley at a metacarpal head. Repetitive forceful compression, tensile stress, and resistive flexion, causes inflammation, swelling, and microtrauma, that results in thickening and stenosis (commonly a nodular formation) of the tendon distal to the pulley leading to a painful digital base, limitation of finger movements, triggering, snapping, locking, and deformity progressively.     
Patients report a popping sound at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP), morning stiffness with/without triggering, delayed and sometimes painful extension of the digit, and when more advanced, a locking position that requires manipulation to extend the affected finger. This condition more commonly affects the middle and ring fingers (occasionally the thumb), and the flexor rather than extensor tendons in the hand.[tpl]cite web|last=Foye, MD|first=Patrick M|title=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for Trigger Finger Clinical Presentation|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/328996-clinical|publisher=WebMD, LLC[/tpl]   
In rheumatic trigger finger (or in diabetes), more than one finger may be involved.  Cases of stenosing peroneal tenosynovitis, have been reported where the patient presents with pain over the lateral malleolus, both with active and passive range of motion and no physical of radiographic evidence of instability.[tpl]cite journal|last=Andersen, MD|first=Erik|title=Stenosing Peroneal Tenosynovitis Symptomaticall Simulating Ankle Instability|journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine|year=1987|volume=15| issue =  3|pages=258–259|doi=10.1177/036354658701500313[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Gunn|first=D.R.|title=Stenosing Tenosynovitis of the Common Peroneal Tendon Sheath|journal=Br Med J.|date=March 14, 1959|pages=691–692|pmc=1993081|pmid=13629094|volume=1|issue=5123|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5123.691[/tpl]

[[Tenosynovitis]]

CATEGORIES: Inflammations, Disorders of synovium and tendon

Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the fluid-filled sheath (called the synovium) that surrounds a tendon. Symptoms of tenosynovitis include pain, swelling and difficulty moving the particular joint where the inflammation occurs. When the condition causes the finger to "stick" in a flexed position, this is called "stenosing" tenosynovitis, commonly known as "trigger finger". This condition often presents with comorbid tendinitis.

[[Franklin eBookMan]]

CATEGORIES: Personal digital assistants, Dedicated e-book devices

The Franklin eBookMan  is a discontinued handheld device made to read ebooks. This gadget, made from 1999 until 2002, has standard  PDA functions and can play and record sounds. It has a black on green touchscreen, contains 8 or 16 MB of RAM, and uses its own proprietary operating system.  Its handwriting recognition system accepts nearly natural handwriting. 
Three models of eBookman were produced: the 900 (8 Mb memory - no backlight), the 901 (8 Mb memory - backlight) and the 911 (16 Mb memory - backlight). All come with an MMC (not SD-compatible for the 8Mb model, but properly compatible with the 16Mb models.) slot which allows for memory expansion. The eBookMan can read contacts and appointments from Microsoft Outlook; synchronization with a Windows PC is done through a USB cable. 
Early eBookMan units lost all information stored on them when the batteries were changed.  Franklin acknowledged the problem, and replaced all defective units at no charge.  Its DRM system is tied directly to the hardware, which resulted in an immediate problem for marketing: it was not possible to try the device in-store since it wouldn't work until the user connected it to an Internet-linked PC and downloaded their own registered version of the OS. Support was provided via a home page at Franklin - now removed - which when development ceased in 2002 was still describing the device as 'new'.
Although research and development on the eBookMan ceased in 2002, new eBookMans continued to be available from Ectaco. As of April 30, 2011, all support and downloads for eBookMan were discontinued.http://www.franklin.com/ebookman/  
There is an active user base.  Some users have written programs for the eBookMan. Many games were developed and a free version of the Mobipocket reader was developed for the eBookMan to take the place of the underpowered Franklin reader which came with the device. 
One reason for the device's failure was an almost complete absence of marketing and a failure to supply reviewers and other opinion leaders with the device. Another was its poor battery life, requiring a battery change every few hours with normal usage.  Yet another problem was lack of update support from Mobipocket.com which decided to discontinue software upgrades for the version of Mobipocket reader that the eBookMan reader used. This meant that as new books were added to their catalog of books for purchase they would be unreadable on the eBookman reader.

[[Aylesbury duck]]

CATEGORIES: Duck breeds, Duck breeds originating in England, Buckinghamshire

The Aylesbury duck is a breed of domesticated duck, bred mainly for its meat and appearance. It is a large duck with pure white plumage, a pink bill, orange legs and feet, an unusually large keel, and a horizontal stance with its body parallel to the ground. The precise origins of the breed are unclear, but raising white ducks became popular in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in the 18th century owing to the demand for white feathers as a filler for quilts. Over the 19th century selective breeding for size, shape and colour led to the Aylesbury duck.
Duck rearing became a major industry in Aylesbury in the 19th century. The ducks were bred on farms in the surrounding countryside. Fertilised eggs were brought into the town's "Duck End", where local residents would rear the ducklings in their homes. The opening of a railway to Aylesbury in 1839 enabled cheap and quick transport to the markets of London, and duck rearing became highly profitable. By the 1860s the duck rearing industry began to move out of Aylesbury into the surrounding towns and villages, and the industry in Aylesbury itself began to decline.
In 1873 the Pekin duck was introduced to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck feed meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.
The First World War badly damaged the remaining duck industry in Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and leaving only a few large farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although there is only one surviving flock of pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.

[[Rushton Triangular Lodge]]

CATEGORIES: Houses in Northamptonshire, English Heritage sites in Northamptonshire, Grade I listed buildings in Northamptonshire, Folly buildings in England, Buildings and structures completed in 1597

The Triangular Lodge is a folly, designed and constructed between 1593 and 1597 by Sir Thomas Tresham near Rushton, Northamptonshire, England. It is now in the care of English Heritage.  The stone used for the construction was alternating bands of dark and light limestone.
Tresham was a Roman Catholic and was imprisoned for a total of fifteen years in the late 16th century for refusing to become a Protestant.  On his release in 1593, he designed the Lodge as a protestation of his faith.  His belief in the Holy Trinity is represented everywhere in the Lodge by the number three: it has three walls 33 feet long, each with three triangular windows and surmounted by three gargoyles.  The building has three floors, upon a basement, and a triangular chimney. Three Latin texts, each 33 letters long, run around the building on each facade.  The quotations are:
The windows on each floor are of different designs, all  equally ornate.  The largest, those on the first floor, are in the form of a trefoil, which was the emblem of the Tresham family.  The basement windows are small trefoils with a triangular pane at their centre.  The windows on the ground floor are of a lozenge design, each having 12 small circular openings surrounding a central cruciform slit. Heraldic shields of various families surround these windows.
The slightly raised ground floor has an entrance in the south-east facade. Over the door, beneath Tresham's coat of arms, is the Latin inscription: Tres testimonium dant , meaning "The number three bears witness" or "Tresham bears witness" (Tres was the pet name his wife used for Tresham in her letters). Also above the door are the numbers "5555". The figures are oddly shaped, and architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner speculated that this may once have read "3333", but that number seems to have no particular significance. It has, however, been pointed out Sir Thomas Tresham's Triangular Lodge - Everything2.com that if 1593 is subtracted from 5555, it leaves 3962 (the date, BC, of the Flood, according to Bede). 
The principal room on each floor is hexagonal, thus leaving the three corner spaces triangular; one of these spaces contains a spiral staircase, the remaining two are small rooms.
The building is crowned, above the quotations on each facade, by three steep gables each surmounted by a three-sided obelisk at the apex.  Among the emblems carved on the gables are, on the southeast side, the highly symbolic seven-branched candelabrum within an octagonal plaque, and a heptagonal plaque depicting the seven eyes of God.  On the north side are a Pelican in her piety, a symbol of Christ and the Eucharist, and a Hen and Chickens; on the southwest gable are a Dove and Serpent; and the Hand of God touching a globe. The triangular chimney is adorned with the holy monogram "IHS", a lamb and cross, and a chalice.
While the lodge is indisputably a testament to Tresham's faith, it is also an example of the Elizabethan love of allegory.  Carved in the gables are the numbers "3509" and "3898": these are said to be the dates (BC) of the Creation and the Calling of Abraham.  Among the more recent dates carved on the building are 1580, thought to be the date of Tresham's conversion, and also the future (at the time of their carving) dates 1626 and 1641 - to what do they refer?  One suggestion is that not only are they divisible by three, but that, when 1593 is subtracted from them, they give 33 and 48, the years in which Jesus and the Virgin Mary are said to have died.
The broken inscriptions inscribed on each gable combine to read "Respicite non mihi laboravi", which means "Behold I have not laboured for myself alone".
The Lodge was the only building Tresham designed which he saw completed before his death in 1605. Nikolaus Pevsner in his The Buildings of England: Northamptonshire states: "as a testament of faith this building must be viewed with respect".  He also considered the lodge so architecturally important that he chose its photograph for the front cover of the first edition (1961) of his book; it also features on the cover of the current edition Northamptonshire Pevsner Architectural Guides: Buildings of England.
The Lodge figures prominently in the chapter of Alan Moore's novel Voice of the Fire concerning Tresham's son Francis, a Gunpowder Plot conspirator.  Moore, a Northampton native, touches on the history of several local sites in his speculative magical realist history of the town.
It is featured on the cover of the album Sun Structures released in February 2014 by the English psychedelic band Temples.

[[Peer group]]

CATEGORIES: Sociological terminology

A peer group is both a social group and a primary group of people who, through homophily, share similarities such as age, background, and social status. The members of this group are likely to influence the person’s beliefs and behaviour.Peer group . (n.d.). Dictionary.com. Retrieved October 25, 2012, from http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/peer+group Peer groups contain hierarchies and distinct patterns of behavior. 18 year olds are not in a peer group with 14 year olds even though they may be in school together. Just as teachers do not share students as a peer group.
During adolescence, peer groups tend to face dramatic changes. Adolescents tend to spend more time with their peers and have less adult supervision. Adolescents’ communication shifts during this time as well. They prefer to talk about school and their careers with their parents, and they enjoy talking about sex and other interpersonal relationships with their peers.[tpl]cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|title=Adolescence|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-353202-5|pages=1–434[/tpl] Children look to join peer groups who accept them, even if the group is involved in negative activities. Children are less likely to accept those who are different from them.
Cliques are small groups typically defined by common interests or by friendship. Cliques typically have 2-12 members and tend to be formed by age, gender, race, and social class. Clique members are usually the same in terms of academics and risk behaviors. Cliques can serve as an agent of socialization and social control.Adler  & Adler, 1995 Being part of a clique can be advantageous since they provide a sense of autonomy, a secure social environment, and over all well being.
Crowds are larger, more vaguely defined groups that may not have a friendship base.Brown, 1990 Crowds serve as peer groups, and they increase in importance during early adolescence, and decrease by late adolescents. The level of involvement in adult institutions and peer culture describes crowds.

Thomas Francis O'Higgins (23 July 1916 – 25 February 2003) was an Irish Fine Gael politician, barrister and judge, who was Chief Justice of Ireland and a member of the European Court of Justice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=19&MemberID=895&ConstID=80|title=Mr. Thomas O'Higgins|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=2 May 2011[/tpl]
Tom O'Higgins was born in Cork in 1916, and came from the influential political family of O'Higgins. He was the son of Thomas F. O'Higgins and the nephew of Kevin O'Higgins. He was educated at St Mary's College, Dublin, Clongowes Wood College and University College Dublin where he became auditor of the Literary and Historical Society. He later attended the King's Inns. In 1938 he qualified as a barrister and was called to the Bar. In 1954 he was called to the Inner Bar.
O'Higgins was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) for the Leix–Offaly constituency at the 1948 general election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1796|title=Tom O'Higgins|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=2 May 2011[/tpl] On the same day his brother, Michael O'Higgins, was also elected. In the Second Inter-Party Government (1954–57) O'Higgins was appointed Minister for Health. During his period as Minister for Health he introduced the Voluntary Health Insurance Board (VHI). During the 1960s O'Higgins worked closely with Garret FitzGerald and Declan Costello in re-shaping Fine Gael. O'Higgins was chosen as the Fine Gael candidate in the 1966 presidential election. He faced the incumbent President and Fianna Fáil candidate Éamon de Valera. O'Higgins came within 1% of beating de Valera, which was much better than he had hoped. 
In 1973 O'Higgins was again chosen as the Fine Gael candidate in the presidential election. This time he faced former Fianna Fáil Tánaiste and minister, Erskine H. Childers. Childers was elected by 635,867 votes to 578,771.
Shortly afterwards O'Higgins was appointed a High Court judge; and in 1974, after the sudden death of William FitzGerald, O'Higgins, although the most junior High Court judge, was chosen to replace him as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. After the sudden death of Erskine H. Childers, O'Higgins, in his role as Chief Justice swore in Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh as President of Ireland. He was Chief Justice until 1985 when he was appointed a Judge of the European Court of Justice. He remained there until 1991.
O'Higgins died on 25 February 2003 at the age of 86.

[[Hot reading]]

CATEGORIES: Confidence tricks, Mentalism

Hot reading is a technique used when giving a psychic reading in stage magic performances, or in other contexts. In hot reading, the reader uses information about the person receiving the reading (for example, from background research or overhearing a conversation) which the receiver is not aware that the reader already knows. Hot reading is commonly used in conjunction with cold reading (where no previously gathered information is used) and can explain how a psychic reader can get a specific claimed "hit" of accurate information.[tpl]cite web | title=Hot Reading | url=http://www.skepdic.com/hotreading.html | publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary |author= Robert Todd Carroll | accessdate=2006-06-14[/tpl]

[[Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations]]
CATEGORIES: Numerical differential equations, Ordinary differential equations

This subject is the part of numerical analysis which studies the methods for finding numerical approximations to the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This field is also known under the name numerical integration, but some people reserve this term for the computation of integrals.
Many differential equations cannot be solved analytically; however, in science and engineering, a numeric approximation to the solution is often good enough to solve a problem. The algorithms studied here can be used to compute such an approximation. An alternative method is to use techniques from calculus to obtain a series expansion of the solution.
Ordinary differential equations occur in many scientific disciplines, for instance in physics, chemistry, biology, and economics. In addition, some methods in numerical partial differential equations convert the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation, which must then be solved.

A libation is a ritual pouring of a liquid as an offering to a god or spirit or in memory of those who have died. It was common in many religions of antiquity and continues to be offered in various cultures today.
Various substances have been used for libations, most commonly wine or olive oil, and in India, ghee. The vessels used in the ritual, including the patera, often had a significant form which differentiated them from secular vessels. The libation could be poured onto something of religious significance, such as an altar, or into the earth.

[[Umberto Giordano]]

CATEGORIES: 1867 births, 1948 deaths, 19th-century classical composers, 20th-century classical composers, Italian composers, Members of the Royal Academy of Italy, Opera composers, People from Foggia, Romantic composers

Umberto Menotti Maria Giordano (28 August 1867 – 12 November 1948) was an Italian composer, mainly of operas.
He was born in Foggia in Puglia, southern Italy, and studied under Paolo Serrao at the Conservatoire of Naples. His first opera Marina, was written for the competition staged by the music publishers Casa Sonzogno for the best one-act opera, remembered today because it marked the beginning of Italian verismo; the winner was Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. Giordano, the youngest candidate, placed sixth among seventy-three with Marina, which generated enough interest for Sonzogno to commission an opera to be staged in the 1891–92 season.
The result was Mala Vita, a gritty verismo opera concerning a labourer who vows to reform a prostitute if he is cured of his tuberculosis. This caused something of a scandal when performed at the Teatro Argentina, Rome, in February 1892. It played successfully at Vienna, Prague and Berlin, and was re-written as Il Voto a few years later in an attempt to raise interest in the work again.
Giordano tried a more romantic approach with his next opera, Regina Diaz, to a libretto by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti and Guido Menasci (1894), but this was also a failure, taken off the stage after just two performances.
Giordano then moved to Milan, and returned to verismo with his best-known work, Andrea Chénier (1896), based on the life of the French poet André Chénier. Fedora (1898), based on Victorien Sardou's play, featured a rising young tenor named Enrico Caruso; it was also a success, and is still performed today. His later works are much less known, but occasionally revived and in the case of La cena delle beffe (based on the play of the same title by Sem Benelli) recognised by musicologists and critics with some respect. He died in Milan at the age of 81.
The most important theater in Foggia has been dedicated to Umberto Giordano. A square in Foggia is also dedicated to him, with many statues representing his most famous works.

The sand cat (Felis margarita), also known as the sand dune cat, is the only felid found primarily in true desert and has a wide but apparently disjunct distribution through the deserts of northern Africa and southwest and central Asia.  Since 2002, this small cat has been listed as Near Threatened by IUCN due to concern over potential low population size and decline.[tpl]IUCN |assessors= Mallon, D. P., Sliwa, A., Strauss, M. |year=2011 |id=8541 |title=Felis margarita |version=2012.2[/tpl]
Sand cats are found in both sandy and stony desert, living in areas far from water.  Having thickly furred feet, they are well adapted to the extremes of a desert environment and tolerant of extremes of hot and cold temperatures.
Victor Loche first described the sand cat in 1858 from a specimen found in the Sahara. He proposed to name the species in recognition of Jean Auguste Margueritte who headed the expedition into the Sahara.Loche, V. (1858).

Granada is historically one of Nicaragua's most important cities, economically and politically. It has a rich colonial heritage, seen in its architecture and structure.
Granada was founded in 1524 by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, ostensibly the first European city in mainland America. Unlike other cities that claim the same distinction, the city of Granada was not only the settlement of the conquest, but also a city registered in official records of the Crown of Aragon, and the Kingdom of Castile in Spain.
Granada is also known as La Gran Sultana, in reflection of its Moorish and Andalusian appearance, unlike its sister city of León and historical rival, which displays Castilian trends.

Members of the Society are often consulted when important issues are being debated in Parliament or by the executive. The Society was formed in 1825.
The Hall of The Law Society is at 113 Chancery Lane, London but it also has offices in Birmingham, Cardiff (to deal with the Wales jurisdiction and Assembly) and Brussels, Belgium (to deal with European Community law).
A president is elected annually to serve for a year. The current president for 2013–14 is Nicholas Fluck. Fluck narrowly lost a vote of no confidence (by fifteen votes) on 17 December 2013 for allegedly mishandling negotiations with the Lord Chancellor about proposed cuts to legal aid.Legalfutures.co.uk "Solicitors pass motion of no-confidence in Law Society president and chief executive."

[[Singing telegram]]

CATEGORIES: Entertainment, Oral communication, Western Union

A singing telegram is a message that is delivered by an artist in a musical form.  Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal telegrams, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.  Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.
Western Union, the  American telegraph company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. On July 28, 1933, a fan sent Hollywood singing star Rudy Vallee a birthday greeting by telegram. George P. Oslin (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular.  He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | title = Special delivery: The singing telegram endures | newspaper = Columbia News Service | date = July 7, 2002[/tpl]. While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought "that messages should be fun," he recalled that he "was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company."[tpl]Citation | title = George Oslin, 97, creator of the singing telegram | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | date = October 31, 1996 | page = 11[/tpl].
As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering.[tpl]Citation | title = Western Union Tuning Out Singing Telegram | newspaper = The New York Times | date = July 29, 1972 | page = 27[/tpl].  Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.
The first singing telegram in the UK is said to have been performed by Mike Collins aka The wandering Minstrel who is still performing fully personalised songs to this day. In 2011, The Wandering Minstrel began giving away full band production audio CDs and DVD music videos of the specially written songs. http://www.minstrelgreetings.com/aboutus.htm

[[Null fill]]

CATEGORIES: Antennas (radio), Broadcast engineering

Null fill is used in radio antenna systems which are located on mountains or tall towers, to prevent too much of the signal from overshooting the nearest part of intended coverage area.  Phasing is used between antenna elements to take power away from the main lobe and electrically direct more of it at a more downward angle in the vertical plane. This requires a phased array. Changing the relative power supplied to each element also changes the radiation pattern in this manner, and often both methods are used in combination.

[[Market cross]]
CATEGORIES: Market towns, Monument types, Cross symbols, Market crosses in England

A market cross, or in Scots mercat cross, is a structure used to mark a market square in market towns, originally from the distinctive tradition in Early Medieval Insular art of free-standing stone standing or high crosses, often elaborately carved, which goes back to the 7th century.  Market crosses can be found in most market towns in Britain, with those in Scotland known as mercat crosses. British emigrants often installed such crosses in their new cities and several can be found in Canada and Australia.
These structures range from carved stone spires, obelisks or crosses, common to small market towns such as that in Stalbridge, Dorset, to large, ornate covered structures, such as the Chichester Cross or Malmesbury Market Cross. Market Crosses can also be constructed from wood; an example is at Wymondham, Norfolk.

Foolad Khuzestan Football Club ([tpl]lang-fa|باشگاه فوتبال فولاد خوزستان[/tpl]) is an Iranian football club, based in Ahvaz, Khuzestan that plays in Iran Pro League. Foolad F.C. was founded in 1971 and is owned by Foolad Khuzestan Company. It was named Foolad partially because it is funded by the industry in Khuzestan. 
The club have won Iran Pro League twice, including a championship in the lower division, Azadegan League. In the 2004–05 season, Foolad became the champion of the fourth newly founded Iran Pro League (IPL), gaining a total of 64 points over 30 league matches that is the highest point for a leader since 2001. After several successful seasons and what at one point seemed to be the emergence of a new pole in Iranian football, Foolad lost many of its key players through transfers and internal problems and also displayed a poor performance in the 2006 AFC Champions League. The club was subsequently relegated to the Azadegan League, second highest division in Iran at the end of the 2006–07. Fortunately however, Foolad was able to return to the IPL starting from the next season, 2008–09 Iran Pro League and has been turning out relatively well in the current standings. Foolad won it's second championship in 2013–14 season.
Foolad's home kit is red and yellow shirts, with the same color for shorts, accompanied by red socks. The colors used in clothing, is derived from the symbol of the club. Uhlsport are the kit manufacturers, the main sponsor is the club's ownership company. The club is the fourth most supported in Iran, after Persepolis, Esteghlal and Tractor Sazi.

CATEGORIES: Mammal anatomy, Bone products

Tusks are elongated, continuously growing front teeth, usually but not always in pairs, that protrude well beyond the mouth of certain mammal species. They are most commonly canines, as with warthogs, pig, and walruses, or, in the case of elephants, elongated incisors. In most tusked species both the males and the females have tusks although the males' are larger. Tusks are generally curved, though the narwhal's sole tusk is straight and has a helical structure. In the elephant, the tusks were originally second incisors. Continuous growth is enabled by formative tissues in the apical openings of the roots of the teeth.[ref]

[[Horizontal plane]]

CATEGORIES: Geodesy

In geometry, physics, astronomy, geography, and related sciences, a plane is said to be horizontal at a given point if it is perpendicular to the gradient of the gravity field at that point— in other words, if apparent gravity makes a plumb bob hang perpendicular to the plane at that point. Alternatively, a spirit level, which exploits the buoyancy of a bubble, can be used to determine if the plane is horizontal.
In radio science, horizontal plane is used to plot an antenna's relative field strength in relation to the ground (which directly affects a station's coverage area) on a polar graph. Normally the maximum of 1.000 or 0 dB is at the top, which is labeled 0o, running clockwise back around to the top at 360°. Other field strengths are expressed as a decimal less than 1.000, a percentage less than 100%, or decibels less than 0 dB. If the graph is of an actual or proposed installation, rotation is
applied so that the top is 0o true north. See also the perpendicular vertical plane.
In general, something that is horizontal can be drawn from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.

[[Vertical plane]]
CATEGORIES: Antennas (radio)

Vertical plane is used in radio to plot an antenna's relative field strength perpendicular to the ground (which directly affects a station's coverage area) on a polar graph. 
Normally the maximum of 1.000 or 0 dB is at the side (unless there is beam tilt), which is labeled 0°, to 90° at the top and −90° at the bottom. Other field strengths are expressed as a decimal less than 1.000, a percentage less than 100%, or decibels less than 0 dB.
Most broadcast antennas use either line-of-sight or ground wave propagation (a slight refraction towards the ground) to reach their nearby listeners, and thus want a low angle in the vertical plane.  Short wave transmitters want a somewhat higher elevation angle in the vertical plane to encourage skywave propagation, which would refract or reflect radio waves off the ionosphere and back to the ground at a great distance from the transmitter.
Omnidirectional antennas typically try to limit the range of their vertical plane radiation pattern to concentrate energy over a smaller range and increase gain.

He was born in 1744 in Dendermonde, which then was in the Austrian Netherlands, to Robert Stedman, a Scot and an officer in the Dutch Republic's Scots Brigade, and his wife of presumed Dutch noble lineage, Antoinetta Christina van Ceulen. He lived most of his childhood in 'the Dutch Republic with his parents but spent time with his uncle in Scotland. Stedman described his childhood as being "chock-full of misadventures and abrasive encounters of every description."Price, xiv His years in Surinam, on the northern coast of South America, were characterized by encounters with African slaves and colonial planters, as well as the exotic local flora and fauna. He recorded his experiences in The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796) which, with its firsthand depictions of slavery and other aspects of colonization, became an important tool in the early abolitionist cause.

[[Beam tilt]]

CATEGORIES: Antennas, Broadcast engineering

Beam tilt is used in radio to aim the main lobe of the  vertical plane radiation pattern of an antenna below (or above) the horizontal plane.
The simplest way is mechanical beam tilt, where the antenna is physically mounted in such a manner as to lower the angle of the signal on one side.  However, this also raises it on the other side, making it useful in only very limited situations.
More common is electrical beam tilt, where the phasing between antenna elements is tweaked to make the signal go down (usually) in all directions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rwonline.com/article/4374|title=Overshoots and Close-In Coverage|last=Alexander|first=W.C.|date=6 November 2002|publisher=Radio World|language=English|accessdate=2009-08-14[/tpl]  This is extremely useful when the antenna is at a very high point, and the edge of the signal is likely to miss the target (broadcast audience, cellphone users, etc.) entirely.
With electrical tilting, front and back lobes tilt in same direction : for example, an electrical downtilt will make both front lobe and back lobe tilt down. This is the property used in the above example where the signal is pointed down in all directions. On the contrary, mechanical downtilting will make the front lobe tilt down and the back lobe tilt up. In almost all practical cases, antennas are only tilted down - though tilting up is technically possible.
A vertical antenna being less visible than a mechanically tilted one, the use of purely electrical tilt with no mechanical tilt is an attractive choice for aesthetic reasons which are very important for operators seeking acceptance of integrated antennas in visible locations.
In GSM and UMTS cellular networks, mechanical tilt is almost always fixed whereas electrical tilt can be controlled using remote actuators and position sensors, thus reducing operating expenses. Remote electrical tilt is abbreviated as RET and it is part of the Antenna Interface Standards Group's open specification for the control interface of antenna devices.
Occasionally, the mechanical and electrical tilt will be used together for odd situations, in order to create greater beam tilt in one direction than the other, mainly to accommodate unusual terrain.  Along with null fill, beam tilt is the essential parameter controlling the focus of radio communications, and together they can create almost infinite combinations of 3-D radiation patterns for any situation.

[[Knights and Knaves]]

CATEGORIES: Logic puzzles

Knights and Knaves is a type of logic puzzle where some characters can only answer questions truthfully, and others only falsely. The name was coined by Raymond Smullyan in his 1978 work What Is the Name of This Book?George Boolos, John P. Burgess, Richard C. Jeffrey, Logic, logic, and logic (Harvard University Press, 1999).
The puzzles are set on a fictional island where all inhabitants are either knights, who always tell the truth, or knaves, who always lie.  The puzzles involve a visitor to the island who meets small groups of inhabitants.  Usually the aim is for the visitor to deduce the inhabitants' type from their statements, but some puzzles of this type ask for other facts to be deduced.  The puzzle may also be to determine a yes-no question which the visitor can ask in order to discover a particular piece of information.
One of Smullyan's examples of this type of puzzle involves three inhabitants referred to as A, B and C.  The visitor asks A what type he is, but does not hear A's answer.  B then says "A said that he is a knave" and C says "Don't believe B; he is lying!"[tpl]cite book | title=What is the Name of this Book? | publisher=Prentice-Hall | author=Smullyan, Raymond | authorlink=Raymond Smullyan | year=1978[/tpl] To solve the puzzle, note that no inhabitant can say that he is a knave.  Therefore B's statement must be untrue, so he is a knave, making C's statement true, so he is a knight. Since A's answer invariably would be "I'm a knight", it is not possible to determine whether A is a knight or knave from the information provided.
Maurice Kraitchik presents the same puzzle in in 1953 book Mathematical Recreations, where two groups on a remote island - the Arbus and the Bosnins - either lie or tell the truth, and respond to the same question as above.[tpl]cite book | title=Mathematical Recreations | publisher=Dover | author=Kraitchik, Maurice | authorlink=Maurice Kraitchik | year=1953 | isbn=0486201635[/tpl]
In some variations, inhabitants may also be alternators, who alternate between lying and telling the truth, or normals, who can say whatever they want. A further complication is that the inhabitants may answer yes/no questions in their own language, and the visitor knows that "bal" and "da" mean "yes" and "no" but does not know which is which. These types of puzzles were a major inspiration for what has become known as "the hardest logic puzzle ever".

[[Source amnesia]]
CATEGORIES: Psychology, Memory, Memory disorders

Source amnesia is the inability to remember where, when or how previously learned information has been acquired, while retaining the factual knowledge.Schacter, D.L., Harbluk, J.L., and McLachlen, D.R. (1984). Retrieval without recollection: an experimental analysis of source amnesia. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour, 23(5): 593-611. This branch of amnesia is associated with the malfunctioning of one's explicit memory. It is likely that the disconnect between having the knowledge and remembering the context in which the knowledge was acquired is due to a dissociation between semantic and episodic memoryTulving, E. (1972). Episodic and semantic memory. In E. Tulving and W. Donaldson (Eds.), Organization of Memory (pp. 381-403). New York: Academic Press. – an individual retains the semantic knowledge (the fact), but lacks the episodic knowledge to indicate the context in which the knowledge was gained.
Memory representations reflect the encoding processes during acquisition. Different types of acquisition processes (e.g.: reading, thinking, listening) and different types of events (e.g.: newspaper, thoughts, conversation) will produce mental depictions that perceptually differ from one another in the brain, making it harder to retrieve where information was learned when placed in a different context of retrieval.Mitchell, K.J., Johnson, M.K. (2000). Source monitoring: Attributing mental experiences. The Oxford handbook of memory.  12: 179-195. Source monitoring involves a systematic process of slow and deliberate thought of where  information was originally learned. Source monitoring can be improved by using more retrieval cues, discovering and noting relations and extended reasoning.

[[Human memory process]]
CATEGORIES: Memory processes

Numerous theoretical accounts of memory have differentiated memory for facts and memory for context.  Psychologist Endel Tulving (1972; 1983) further defined these two declarative memory conceptions of explicit memory (in which information is consciously registered and recalled) into semantic memory wherein general world knowledge not tied to specific events is stored and episodic memory involving the storage of context-specific information about personal experiences (i.e. time, location, and surroundings of personal knowledge). Conversely, implicit memory (non declarative) involves perhaps unconscious registration (lack of awareness during encoding), yet definite unconscious recollection.  Skills and habits, priming, and classical conditioning all utilize implicit memory.
An essential aspect of episodic memory includes date and time encoding in the subject's past.  For such processing, the details surrounding the memory (where, when, and with whom the experience took place) must be preserved and are necessary for an episodic memory to form, otherwise the memory would be semantic.  For instance, one may possess an episodic memory of John F. Kennedy's assassination, including the fact that he was watching Walter Cronkite announce that Kennedy had been murdered.  However, if the contextual details of this event were lost, remaining would be a semantic memory that John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  The ability to recall episodic information concerning a memory has been termed source monitoring, and is subject to distortion that may lead to source amnesia.

[[Memory distrust syndrome]]
CATEGORIES: Psychology

Memory distrust syndrome is a condition coined by  Gísli Guðjónsson and James MacKeith in 1982, in which an individual doubts the accuracy of their memory concerning the content and context of events of which they have experienced. Since the individual does not trust their own memory, they will commonly depend on outside sources of information rather than using their ability for recollection. Some believe that this may be a defense or coping mechanism to a preexisting faulty memory state such as Alzheimer's disease, amnesia, or possibly dementia.
The condition is generally considered to be related to source amnesia, which involves the inability to recall the basis for factual knowledge. The main difference between the two is that source amnesia is a lack of knowing the basis of knowledge, whereas memory distrust syndrome is a lack of believing the knowledge that exists. The fact that an individual lacks the trust in their own memory implies that the individual would have a reason or belief that would prevent them from the trust that most of us have in our recollections. Cases concerning memory distrust syndrome have led to documented false confessions in court cases.

Rising from a modest beginning in Acadia in 1683 as an explorer, trapper, and a trader of alcohol and furs, he achieved various positions of political importance in the colony. He was the commander of Fort de Buade, modern-day St. Ignace, Michigan, in 1694. In 1701, he founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, the beginnings of modern Detroit, which he commanded until 1710. Between 1710 and 1716 he was the governor of Louisiana, although he did not arrive in that territory until 1713.
His knowledge of the coasts of New England and the Great Lakes area was appreciated by Frontenac, governor of New France, and Pontchartrain, Secretary of State for the Navy. This earned him various favors, including the Order of Saint Louis from King Louis XIV. The Jesuits in Quebec, however, criticized his perceived perversion of the "Amerindians", North America's indigenous peoples, with his alcohol and fur trading. La Mothe was imprisoned for a few months in Quebec in 1704, and again in the Bastille on his return to France in 1717.
The city he helped found, Detroit, became the world center of automobile production in the 20th century. William H. Murphy and Henry M. Leland, founders of the Cadillac auto company, paid homage to him by using his name for their company and his armorial bearings as its logo in 1902.[tpl]cite book|author=William Pelfrey|title=Billy, Alfred, and General Motors: The Story of Two Unique Men, a Legendary Company, and a Remarkable Time in American History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HYFIiIll2eIC&pg=PA70|year=2006|publisher=AMACOM |page=70[/tpl] Various places bear his name in North America, in particular Cadillac Mountain, Maine, and the town of Cadillac, Michigan.
He was widely hailed as a hero in the popular mind until the 1950s and rethinking of the colonial enterprise. Since then Zoltvany finds, "he most definitely was not one of the 'great early heroes' and probably deserves to be ranked with the 'worst scoundrels ever to set foot in New France.'"Yves F. Zoltvany.

[[Henry Ford Company]]

The Henry Ford Company was the second company for Henry Ford, founded November 3, 1901. It resulted from the reorganization of the Detroit Automobile Company, his first unsuccessful attempt at automobile manufacture a year before. In March 1902, Ford left the company following a dispute with his financial backers, William Murphy and Lemuel Bowen. In a final settlement, Ford left with his name and 900 dollars; he went on to start the Ford Motor Company in 1903.
In August 1902, Henry M. Leland was brought in by the investors to appraise the plant and equipment prior to selling them. Instead, Leland persuaded them to continue in the automobile business. The Henry Ford Company reorganized that year as Cadillac in honor of Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, the founder of Detroit.
Cadillac's first car was completed on October 17, 1902, the 10 horsepower (7 kW) Cadillac. Based on Henry Ford's design (except for the engine, designed by Leland & Faulconer), it was practically identical to the 1903 Ford Model A.
Located in Detroit at the intersection of Clark Street and Michigan Avenue in a triangle of land bounded by the intersection of two railway lines, the original manufacturing plant remained in operation under Cadillac until the early 1990s, referred to as both "Cadillac Main" and "Cadillac Plant #1".  During the last decade or so, the plant was gradually closed down—as the freight elevators in its multi-story assembly buildings were the cause of production bottlenecks, especially when one or more were shut down for mechanical failure (despite an outside maintenance contractor having an on-site office and elevator repair and service personnel).
In the late 1990s, Cadillac completely shut down all operations at that plant, and the land was leveled, to be redeveloped as an industrial park.

[[Patriarch of Antioch]]

CATEGORIES: Apostolic sees, Patriarchs of Antioch, Eastern Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Dioceses established in the 1st century, 34 in Asia

Patriarch of Antioch is a traditional title held by the Bishop of Antioch. As the traditional "overseer" (ἐπίσκοπος, episkopos, from which the word 'bishop' is derived) of the first gentile Christian community, the position has been of prime importance in the church from its earliest period. This diocese is one of the few for which the names of its bishops from the apostolic beginnings have been preserved. Today five churches use the title of Patriarch of Antioch: the Syriac Orthodox Church and Syriac Catholic Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, Melkite Greek Catholic Church, and Maronite Church; and, historically, there has also been a Latin Patriarch of Antioch.
According to church tradition, this ancient Patriarchate was founded by the Apostle Saint Peter. The patriarchal succession was disputed at the time of the Meletian schism in 362 and again after the Council of Chalcedon in 451, when there were rival Melkite and non-Chalcedonian claimants to the see. After a 7th-century succession dispute in the Melkite church, the Maronites began appointing a Maronite Patriarch as well. After the First Crusade, the Catholic Church began appointing a Latin Rite Patriarch of Antioch, though this became strictly titular after the Fall of Antioch in 1268, and was abolished completely in 1964. In the 18th century, succession disputes in the Greek Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox Churches of Antioch led to factions of those churches entering into communion with Rome under claimants to the patriarchate: the Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and the Syriac Catholic Patriarch of Antioch, respectively. Their Orthodox counterparts are the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch and the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, respectively.

These dog sleds were important for transportation in arctic areas, hauling supplies in areas that were inaccessible by other methods. They were used with varying success in the explorations of both poles, as well as during the Alaskan gold rush. Until snowmobiles became reliable, sled dog teams delivered mail to rural communities in Alaska and northern Canada.
Sled dogs today are still used by some rural communities, especially in areas of Alaska and Canada and throughout Greenland. They are also used for recreational purposes, and are raced in events known as dog sled races such as the Iditarod and the Yukon Quest. Numerous sled dog breeds are also kept as pets or raised as show dogs.

Trajan's Column ([tpl]lang-it|Colonna Traiana[/tpl]) is a Roman triumphal column in Rome, Italy, that commemorates Roman emperor Trajan's victory in the Dacian Wars. It was probably constructed under the supervision of the architect Apollodorus of Damascus at the order of the Roman Senate. It is located in Trajan's Forum, built near the Quirinal Hill, north of the Roman Forum. Completed in AD 113, the freestanding column is most famous for its spiral bas relief, which artistically describes the epic wars between the Romans and Dacians (101–102 and 105–106). Its design has inspired numerous victory columns, both ancient and modern.
The structure is about 30 metres (98 ft) in height, 35 metres (125 ft) including its large pedestal. The shaft is made from a series of 20 colossal Carrara marble drums, each weighing about 32 tons, with a diameter of 3.7 metres (11 ft). The 190-metre (625 ft) frieze winds around the shaft 23 times. Inside the shaft, a spiral staircase of 185 steps provides access to a viewing platform at the top. The capital block of Trajan's Column weighs 53.3 tons, which had to be lifted to a height of c. 34 m.
Ancient coins indicate preliminary plans to top the column with a statue of a bird, probably an eagle,[tpl]harvnb|Platner|1929[/tpl] but after construction, a statue of Trajan was put in place; this statue disappeared in the Middle Ages. On December 4, 1587, the top was crowned by Pope Sixtus V with a bronze figure of St. Peter, which remains to this day.[tpl]harvnb|Paoletti|Radke|2005|p=541[/tpl]

The Patriarch of Alexandria (also known as the Bishop of Alexandria or Pope of Alexandria) is the highest-ranking bishop of Egypt and exists separately in both the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Orthodox Church. The Patriarchs trace back their lineage to Mark the Evangelist. 
This list contains those Patriarchs who served before 536, when the Coptic Orthodox and the Greek (Melchite) lineages permanently parted ways. This schism first began in 451, after the Council of Chalcedon, but for the next decades both parties still competed on the See of Alexandria and frequently still recognized the same Patriarch. For later Popes and Patriarchs, follow the links at the bottom of this page.

Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction: The Assessment of the British Government, also known as the September Dossier, was a document published by the British government on 24 September 2002 on the same day of a recall of Parliament to discuss the contents of the document.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2002-09-24.1.0 |title=Iraq and Weapons of Mass Destruction |date=24 September 2002 |author=Hansard |website=TheyWorkForYou |publisher=mySociety |accessdate=2013-06-06[/tpl] The paper was part of an ongoing investigation by the government into weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq, which ultimately led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It contained a number of allegations according to which Iraq also possessed WMD, including chemical weapons and biological weapons. The dossier even alleged that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons programme. Without exception, all of the allegations included within the September Dossier have been since proven to be false, as shown by the Iraq Survey Group.
The much-anticipated document was based on reports made by the Joint Intelligence Committee, part of the British Intelligence 'machinery'. Most of the evidence was uncredited, ostensibly in order to protect sources. On publication, serious press comment was generally critical of the dossier for tameness and for the seeming lack of any genuinely new evidence. Those politically opposed to military action against Iraq generally agreed that the dossier was unremarkable, with Menzies Campbell observing in the House of Commons that:
[tpl]cquote|We can also agree that Hussein most certainly has chemical and biological weapons and is working towards a nuclear capability. The dossier contains confirmation of information that we either knew or most certainly should have been willing to assume.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020924/debtext/20924-12.htm#20924-12_spnew1 |title=House of Commons Hansard for 24 Sept 2002 (pt 12) |date=24 September 2002 |website=www.parliament.uk |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |location=London |page=Column 43 |nopp=y |accessdate=2013-06-06[/tpl][/tpl]
However, two sections later became the centre of fierce debate: the allegation that Iraq had sought "significant quantities of uranium from Africa", and the claim in the foreword to the document written by British Prime Minister Tony Blair that "The document discloses that his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them."[tpl]cite news |title=Full text of Tony Blair's foreword to the dossier on Iraq |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/sep/24/iraq.speeches |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |date=24 September 2002 |accessdate=2013-06-06[/tpl]
Britain's biggest selling popular daily newspaper, The Sun, subsequently carried the headline "Brits 45mins from doom", while the Daily Star reported "Mad Saddam ready to attack: 45 minutes from a chemical war",[tpl]cite news |title=Timeline: The 45-minute claim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3466005.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=13 October 2004 |accessdate=2013-05-09[/tpl] helping to create the impression among the British public that Iraq was a threat to Britain.
Major General Michael Laurie, one of those involved in producing the dossier wrote to the Chilcot Inquiry in 2011 saying "the purpose of the dossier was precisely to make a case for war, rather than setting out the available intelligence, and that to make the best out of sparse and inconclusive intelligence the wording was developed with care."[tpl]cite news |title=Iraq dossier drawn up to make case for war – intelligence officer |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |authorlink=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/12/iraq-dossier-case-for-war |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |date=12 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl] On 26 June 2011, The Observer reported on a memo from John Scarlett to Blair's foreign affairs adviser, released under the Freedom of Information Act, which referred to "the benefit of obscuring the fact that in terms of WMD Iraq is not that exceptional". The memo has been described as one of the most significant documents on the September dossier yet published as it is considered a proposal to mislead the public.[tpl]cite news |title=Memo reveals intelligence chief's bid to fuel fears of Iraqi WMDs |first=Chris |last=Ames |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jun/26/intelligence-chief-iraqi-wmds |newspaper=The Observer |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=2013-06-06[/tpl]

[[Debits and credits]]
CATEGORIES: Accounting systems, Accounting terminology

In double entry bookkeeping, debits and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers to record changes in value resulting from business transactions. Generally speaking, the source account for the transaction is credited (that is, an entry is made on the right side of the account's ledger) and the destination account is debited (that is, an entry is made on the left side). Total debits must equal total credits for each transaction; individual transactions may require multiple debit and credit entries to record.[tpl]cite web|title=Debit Credit Rules|url=http://accountingexplained.com/financial/introduction/debit-credit-rules|work=Accounting Explained|publisher=AccountingExplained.com|accessdate=4 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Making sense of Debits and Credits in Accounting|url=http://basicaccountingconcepts.wordpress.com/2012/03/31/making-sense-of-debits-and-credits-in-accounting/|accessdate=5 May 2013[/tpl]
The difference between the total debits and total credits in a single account is the account's balance. If debits exceed credits, the account has a debit balance; if credits exceed debits, the account has a credit balance.[tpl]cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Kermit|last2=Jensen|first2=Tilly|year=2005|title=Fundamental Accounting Principles|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|isbn=0-07-091649-7[/tpl] For the company as a whole, the totals of debit balances and credit balances must be equal as shown in the trial balance report, otherwise an error has occurred.
Accountants use the trial balance to prepare financial statements (such as the balance sheet and income statement) which communicate information about the company's financial activities in a generally accepted standardized format.

[[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census]]

CATEGORIES: Demographics of the United States, Race in the United States, Ethnic groups in the United States

Race and ethnicity in the United States Census, defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the United States Census Bureau, are self-identification data items in which residents choose the race or races with which they most closely identify, and indicate whether or not they are of Hispanic or Latino origin (the only categories for ethnicity).[tpl]cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/home/en/epss/glossary_r.html |title=American FactFinder Help: Race |accessdate=2008-10-08 |publisher=United States Census Bureau[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/home/en/epss/glossary_h.html |title=American FactFinder Help: Hispanic or Latino origin |accessdate=2008-10-08 |publisher=United States Census Bureau[/tpl]
The racial categories represent a social-political construct for the race or races that respondents consider themselves to be and "generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country." OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the US Census as not "scientific or anthropological" and takes into account "social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry", using "appropriate scientific methodologies" that are not "primarily biological or genetic in reference."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/gvt/ombdraft.htm |title=A Brief History of the OMB Directive 15 |accessdate=2007-05-18 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |year=1997[/tpl] The race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.[tpl]cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/home/en/epss/glossary_e.html |title=American FactFinder Help: Ethnicity | accessdate=2010-04-25 |publisher=United States Census Bureau[/tpl]
Race and ethnicity are considered separate and distinct identities, with Hispanic or Latino origin asked as a separate question. Thus, in addition to their race or races, all respondents are categorized by membership in one of two ethnic categories, which are "Hispanic or Latino" and "Not Hispanic or Latino". However, the practice of separating "race" and "ethnicity" as different categories has been criticized both by the American Anthropological Association and members of U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.[tpl]cite web|title=Racial Categorization in the 2010 Census|url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/RC2010Web_Version.pdf|publisher=U.S. Commission of Civil Rights|accessdate=7 December 2012|author=Gerald A.

In 1997, OMB issued a Federal Register Notice regarding revisions to the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity |publisher=Office of Management and Budget |date=1997-10-30 |accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] OMB developed race and ethnic standards in order to provide "consistent data on race and ethnicity throughout the Federal Government. The development of the data standards stem in large measure from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights laws." Among the changes, OMB issued the instruction to "mark one or more races" after noting evidence of increasing numbers of interracial children and wanting to capture the diversity in a measurable way and having received requests by people who wanted to be able to acknowledge their or their children's full ancestry rather than identifying with only one group. Prior to this decision, the Census and other government data collections asked people to report only one race.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/raceqandas.html|title=Questions and Answers for Census 2000 Data on Race |date=March 14, 2001 | accessdate=2010-04-25 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100304131211/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/raceqandas.html |archivedate=March 4, 2010[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman religion, Ancient Greek pot shapes

In the material culture of classical antiquity, a phiale or pateraThere is no meaningful distinction between the two terms: Nancy Thompson de Grummond and Erika Simon, The Religion of the Etruscans (University of Texas Press, 2006), p. 171; Gocha R. Tsetskhladze, North Pontic Archaeology: Recent Discoveries and Studies (Brill, 2001), p. 239; Rabun Taylor, The Moral Mirror of Roman Art (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 107; Rebecca Miller Ammerma, The Sanctuary of Santa Venera at Paestum (University of Michigan Press, 2002), pp. 64, 66. ([tpl]IPA-la|ˈpatera[/tpl]) is a shallow ceramic or metal libation bowl. It often has a bulbous indentation (omphalos, "bellybutton") in the center underside to facilitate holding it, in which case it is sometimes called a mesomphalic phiale. It typically has no handles, and no feet. (A drinking cup with handles is a kylix. A circular platter with a pair of C-handles is not a patera, but a few paterae have a single long straight handle.) Although the two terms may be used interchangeably, particularly in the context of Etruscan culture, phiale is more common in reference to Greek forms, and patera in a Roman setting.

The Edelweiss Pirates (Edelweißpiraten) were a loosely-organized group of youths in Nazi Germany. They emerged in western Germany out of the German Youth Movement of the late 1930s in response to the strict regimentation of the Hitler Youth. Similar in many ways to the Leipzig Meuten, they consisted of young people, mainly between the ages of 14 and 17, who had evaded the Hitler Youth by leaving school (which was allowed at 14) and were also young enough to avoid military conscription, which was only compulsory from the age of 17 onwards.  The roots and background of the Edelweiss Pirates movement were broached in the 2004 film Edelweiss Pirates, directed by Niko von Glasow.

It was found and proved to be minimal by Leonhard Euler in 1744.L. Euler, Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas maximi minimive proprietate gaudentes, 1744, in: Opera omnia I, 24 Early work on the subject was published also by Jean Baptiste Meusnier.Meusnier, J. B. "Mémoire sur la courbure des surfaces." Mém. des savans étrangers 10 (lu 1776), 477-510, 1785 There are only two minimal surfaces of revolution (surfaces of revolution which are also minimal surfaces): the plane and the catenoid.Catenoid at MathWorld
The catenoid may be defined by the following parametric equations:
In cylindrical coordinates:
A physical model of a catenoid can be formed by dipping two circles into a soap solution and slowly drawing the circles apart.
The catenoid may be also defined approximately by the Stretched grid method as a facet 3D model

[[Seppala Siberian Sleddog]]
CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Sled dog breeds, Dog breeds originating in Canada

A rare working dog breed, the Seppala Siberian Sleddog is developed for the purpose of pulling a sled in cold country. It is a moderate-sized dog averaging 40 to 50 pounds (18 to 23 kg) weight and 22 or 23 inches (56 to 58 cm) height. Colours and markings are considered of little importance; eyes may be brown, blue or any combination of the two colours. Seppalas are active and energetic but very docile and trainable.
Seppalas show a primitive canine type, never having been bred or selected for conformation or the show ring. The breed shares its ancestral base with the Siberian Husky and for half a century shared the same registry with that breed, but was bred always exclusively as a working sleddog breed in its own right and kept apart from show bloodlines. In the late 1990s, it was recognised by Canadian agricultural authorities as a new “evolving breed” and in 2002 a similar separate breed initiative was started in the USA.

Lucinda Williams (born January 26, 1953)Lucinda Williams biography. Allmusic. Retrieved on October 7, 2008. is an American rock, folk, blues, and country music singer and songwriter.
She recorded her first albums in 1978 and 1980 in a traditional country and blues style and received very little attention from radio, the media, or the public. In 1988, she released her self-titled album, Lucinda Williams. This release featured "Passionate Kisses", a song later recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter, which garnered Williams her first Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1994.
Known for working slowly, Williams recorded and released only one other album in the next several years (Sweet Old World in 1992) before her greatest success came in 1998 with Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country, and Americana into a more distinctive style that still managed to remain consistent and commercial in sound. It went gold and earned Williams another Grammy while being universally acclaimed by critics. Since Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, she has released a string of albums that have also been critically acclaimed, though none have sold in the numbers of her 1998 breakthrough. She was also named "America's best songwriter" by TIME magazine in 2002."'Essence' of the South". CNN/TIME. Retrieved on October 7, 2008.

A violent crime or crime of violence is a crime in which the offender uses or threatens to use violent force upon the victim. This entails both crimes in which the violent act is the objective, such as murder, as well as crimes in which violence is the means to an end, (including criminal ends) such as robbery. Violent crimes include crimes committed with weapons. With the exception of rape (which accounts for 6% of all reported violent crimes), males are the primary victims of all forms of violent crime.Bureau of Justice Statistics Victim Characteristics[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] A violent crime may end with injury or death, both on the part of victim and offender.

It was used as an upper stage on the Atlas, Thor, Thorad and Titan IIIB rockets, and considered for others including the Space Shuttle[tpl]cite journal|url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19720013175_1972013175.pdf|title=Shuttle/Agena study|volume=1: Executive summary|publisher=Lockheed Aircraft Corporation|date=25 February 1972|accessdate=20 July 2010[/tpl] and Atlas V. A total of 365 Agena rockets were launched between February 28, 1959 and February 1987.
On some missions, the payload was built directly into the Agena, which provided it with electric power, communications and three-axis stabilization. Payload components were usually located ahead of the Agena's standard bulkhead. On missions where the payload was not built into the Agena, and instead separated after launch, the Agena was known as an Ascent Agena. The Agena was upgraded twice from the original Agena-A in order to support heavier and more sophisticated satellites, such as Corona spacecraft with multiple and more powerful cameras.
The Agena name was suggested by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency for the star Beta Centauri, also known as Agena, because this upper stage would "ignite in the sky".  This followed Lockheed's tradition of naming products for stellar phenomena.[tpl]cite book|title=Origin of NASA Names|publisher=NASA Science and Technical Information Office|page=6-7|author=Helen T. Wells, Susan H. Whiteley, and Carrie E. Karegeannes[/tpl]

[[Nicholas Rémy]]
CATEGORIES: 1530 births, 1616 deaths, Demonologists, French judges, Witch hunters

Nicholas Rémy, Latin Remigius (1530–1616) was a French magistrate who became famous as a hunter of witches comparable to Jean Bodin and De Lancre.Jackson J. Spielvogel Western Civilization: Since 1300 Page 446 "Nicholas Rémy, a witchcraft judge in France in the 1590s, found it “not unreasonable that this scum of humanity witches should be drawn chiefly from the feminine sex.”" 
After studying law at the University of Toulouse, Remy practised in Paris from 1563 to 1570. In 1570, his uncle retired as Lieutenant General of Vosges and Remy was appointed to the post; in 1575 he was appointed as secretary to Duke Charles III of Lorraine.
Remy wrote a number of poems and several books on history, but is known for his Daemonolatreiae libri tres ("Demonolatry"), published in Lyon in 1595. The book was reprinted several times, translated into German, and eventually replaced the Malleus Maleficarum as the most recognized handbook of witch-hunters in parts of Europe.
According to Remy, the Devil could appear before people in the shape of a black man or animal, and liked Black Masses. Demons could also have sexual relationships with women and, in case they did not agree, rape them.
Remy claimed to be responsible for the death of more than nine hundred persons in witch trials between 1582 and 1592. This cannot be corroborated against surviving records, but Remy cited over one hundred specific cases in Demonolatry.
He was of the Catholic faith, and did his work with the blessings of the Church, but was not himself a priest and married at least once (possibly twice), fathering quite a few children. One of them, a favored son, was supposedly killed in a street accident at the beginning of Remy's judicial career after being cursed by an old beggar woman when Remy refused to give her any money. This incident in 1582 was the start of Remy's career as a witch-hunter. He successfully prosecuted the beggar for bewitching his son and had the woman put to death. Finding witches was very personal business for Remy. An extremely educated man for his day, he utterly believed in what he was doing. He saw every "witch" he burned as real, and considered it justice done. Remy personally sentenced 900 people to death between 1581-1591. In 1592, Remy retired and moved to the country to escape the plague. There he compiled notes from his ten year campaign against witchcraft into the Demonolatry.

Traditionally an oath (from Anglo-Saxon āð, also called plight) is either a statement of fact or a promise with wording relating to something considered sacred as a sign of verity. Legal substitute for those who conscientiously object to making a sacred oath is to give an affirmation instead. Nowadays, even when there's no notion of sanctity involved, certain promises said out loud in ceremonial or juridical purpose are referred to as oaths.

The county was named for John Milton, Secretary of State of Georgia from 1777 to 1799.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=Milton County | encyclopedia=New Georgia Encyclopedia | accessdate=September 10, 2011 | author=Dillman, Caroline Matheny | year=2003 | url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1265 [/tpl]  Alpharetta was the county seat until the end of 1931, when Milton was merged with Fulton County to save it from bankruptcy during the Great Depression.[tpl]cite web |url=http://alpharetta.ga.us/index.php?p=73 |title=History |publisher=City of Alpharetta, Georgia[/tpl] At that time, Campbell County, which had already gone bankrupt, was also ceded to Fulton, giving it its 70-mile (110 km) long irregular shape along the Chattahoochee River.
Following the 1932 merger, the Cobb County town of Roswell was also ceded to Fulton four months later on May 9, 1932.  The cession of Roswell (including everything east of Willeo Creek) made the new county more contiguous, though a very narrow strip (what is now the Dunwoody Panhandle of Sandy Springs, ceded to Milton from DeKalb) actually already connected the two sections.
In 1900, there were several other post offices besides Alpharetta: Arnold, Coker, Dinsmore, Field's Cross Roads, Freemansville, McClure, Mazeppa, Ocee, Skelton, Stono, and Warsaw.  Milton totaled [tpl]convert|147|sqmi|km2[/tpl] or 94,080 acres.  There was a population of 6,763, which was 555 more than at the previous (1890) census.  Alpharetta had 310 residents, 1,529 lived in and around it.  Methodists and Baptists were the dominant religious denominations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U_c0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA692&lpg=PA692&dq=dekalb+milton&source=web&ots=nDihbrkvfZ&sig=3Dgzrvn6Pi-0sHeJGYQriqXfwpo&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=5&ct=result#PPA762,M1 |title=Georgia, historical and industrial - Obediah B.

Miya Masaoka (born Washington, D.C., 1958) is an American musician and composer who performs on the 17, 21 and 25-string Japanese koto, often augmenting it with string preparations and electronic triggers (as in her "Koto Monster", where additional laser beam "strings" hover over
the koto). She is Japanese American.
She is known for creative, improvisational technique, and a sensibility that combines experimental Western approaches with the tradition of the koto.
Her compositions have included works for large ensembles, sometimes with unusual sound sources such as hives of bees, or the amplified sounds of human bodies (brain waves, heartbeat, etc.).  One notable piece was performed outdoors in a plaza on San Francisco's sometimes unsavory Market Street, utilizing an ensemble of dozens of musicians, a pair of male and female exotic dancers, and taped interviews with sex workers: "What's the Difference Between Stripping and Playing the Violin?"  An impressive blend of musical composition, and site-specific conceptual art.
She has also done performance art utilizing insects (Madagascar hissing cockroaches, bees) crawling across her body (references to the Yoko Ono film Fly).
Miya Masaoka is known as one of the more distinctive members of the Bay Area Improv Scene (sometimes also called the Creative/New Music scene) in the San Francisco Bay Area. She is a founding member of the electro-acoustic improvisation and experimental trio Maybe Monday with saxophonist Larry Ochs from Rova Saxophone Quartet and guitarist Fred Frith. She is one of the founders of the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival (SFEMF).
She is married to composer/trombonist George Lewis. They have a child together. She was previously married to Jesse Drew and has a daughter from that partnership.

Campbell County, Georgia was a county of the U.S. state of Georgia from 1828 to 1931.  It was created by the state legislature on December 20, 1828 from land taken from Fayette, Coweta, and Carroll counties, and from the half of DeKalb County which became Fulton County soon afterward.  Georgia's Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832 also added to the county. The county was named for Duncan G. Campbell, one of the U.S. commissioners responsible for the Treaty of Indian Springs.[tpl]cite web|title=Campbell County|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/histcountymaps/campbellhistmaps.htm|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=4 February 2012[/tpl]
The original county seat was Campbellton; however, when the Atlanta & West Point Railroad began to plan its route, the town's residents said no due to noise concerns.  The tracks were laid through Fairburn instead, which flourished while Campbellton died out, and Fairburn soon became the new county seat in 1870. The Campbell County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The northwestern half of Campbell (and a bit more of Carroll) became Douglas County in 1870, divided on  October 17 at the Chattahoochee River.  The remainder of Campbell County was ceded to Fulton County at the end of 1931, along with Milton County, to save money.  The legislation creating the merger was enacted on August 9, 1929, with Milton being added to the process in 1931.

Social Realism, an international art movement, refers to the work of painters, printmakers, photographers and filmmakers who draw attention to the everyday conditions of the working classes and the poor, and who are critical of the social structures that maintain these conditions. While the movement's artistic styles vary from nation to nation, it almost always utilizes a form of descriptive or critical realism.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10195|title=Social Realism |last1=Todd |first1=James G. |last2= |first2= |date=2009 |work=Art Terms  |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl]

Namor the Sub-Mariner (Namor McKenzie) is a fictional character, a comic book superhero that appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. Debuting in early 1939, the character was created by writer-artist Bill Everett for Funnies Inc., one of the first "packagers" in the early days of comic books that supplied comics on demand to publishers looking to enter the new medium. Initially created for the unreleased comic Motion Picture Funnies Weekly, the Sub-Mariner first appeared publicly in Marvel Comics #1 (Oct. 1939) — the first comic book from Timely Comics, the 1930s-1940s predecessor of the company Marvel Comics. During that period, known to historians and fans as the Golden Age of Comic Books, the Sub-Mariner was one of Timely's top three characters, along with Captain America and the original Human Torch. Everett said the character's name was inspired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner".[tpl]cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|title = Marvel Universe|publisher = Harry N.

The mutant son of a human sea captain and a princess of the mythical undersea kingdom of Atlantis, Namor possesses the super-strength and aquatic abilities of the Homo mermanus race, as well as the mutant ability of flight, along with other superhuman powers. Through the years, he has been alternately portrayed as a good-natured but short-fused superhero, or a hostile invader seeking vengeance for perceived wrongs that misguided surface-dwellers committed against his kingdom.

CATEGORIES: Cisticolidae, Bird families

The Cisticolidae family of small passerine birds is a group of about 110 warblers found mainly in warmer southern regions of the Old World. They are often included within the Old World warbler family Sylviidae.
This family probably originated in Africa, which has the majority of species, but there are representatives of the family across tropical Asia into Australasia, and one species, the Zitting Cisticola, even breeds in Europe.
These are generally very small birds of drab brown or grey appearance found in open country such as grassland or scrub. They are often difficult to see and many species are similar in appearance, so the song is often the best identification guide.
These are insectivorous birds which nest low in vegetation.

[[External beam radiotherapy]]

CATEGORIES: Electron beams in medical applications, Radiation therapy

External beam radiotherapy or teletherapy is the most common form of radiotherapy. The patient sits or lies on a couch and an external source of radiation is pointed at a particular part of the body. In contrast to internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy), in which the radiation source is inside the body, external beam radiotherapy directs the radiation at the tumour from outside the body. Kilovoltage ("superficial") X-rays are used for treating skin cancer and superficial structures. Megavoltage ("deep") X-rays are used to treat deep-seated tumours (e.g. bladder, bowel, prostate, lung, or brain).
While X-ray and electron beams are by far the most widely used sources for external beam radiotherapy, a small number of centers operate experimental and pilot programs employing heavier particle beams, particularly proton sources.

[[Superficial X-rays]]
CATEGORIES: X-rays, Radiation therapy

Superficial X-rays are low energy X-rays that do not penetrate very far before they are absorbed. They are produced by linear accelerators operating at voltages in the 50–200 kV range, and therefore have an energy in the 50–200 keV range (see External beam radiotherapy for an explanation of the maximum and mean energies as a function of voltage). They are useful in radiation therapy for the treatment of various benign or malignant skin problems, and have a useful depth of a couple of millimetres — certainly not more than 5 mm.
By convention, the voltage is used to characterize X- and gamma-ray beams (in volts), whilst electron beams are characterized by their energies (in electronvolts).

[[Orthovoltage X-rays]]
CATEGORIES: Radiation therapy, X-rays

Orthovoltage X-rays are produced by X-ray generators operating at voltages in the 200–500 kV range, and therefore an energy in the 200–500 keV range (see external beam radiotherapy for an explanation of the maximum and mean energies as a function of voltage). When used to treat patients, radiation oncologists find that they penetrate to a useful depth of about 4–6 cm. That makes them good for treating skin, superficial tissues, and ribs, but not for deeper structures such as lungs or pelvic organs.
Orthovoltage X-rays are sometimes termed "deep" X-rays (DXR). Historically, as radiation machines were improved in the 1930s–1940s, the beam energy (and so its penetration) were increased. So as the new 200–500 kV beams became available, they were considered 'deep'. Now, with modern linear accelerators being able to produce X-rays of much higher energy, the penetration of orthovoltage X-rays is considered quite shallow.
By convention, the voltage is used to characterize X- and gamma-ray beams (in volts), whilst electron beams are characterized by their energies (in electronvolts).

[[Radiation oncologist]]
CATEGORIES: Oncology, Radiation therapy

A radiation oncologist is a specialist physician who uses ionizing radiation (such as megavoltage X-rays or radionuclides) in the treatment of cancer.  Radiation oncology is one of the three primary specialties, the other two being surgical and medical oncology, involved in the treatment of cancer.  Radiation can be given as a curative modality, either alone or in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy. It may also be used palliatively, to relieve symptoms in patients with incurable cancers. A radiation oncologist may also use radiation to treat some benign diseases and  benign tumors.  In some countries (not the United States), radiotherapy and chemotherapy are controlled by a single oncologist who is a "clinical oncologist". Radiation oncologists work closely with other physicians such as surgical oncologists, interventional radiologists,  internal medicine subspecialists, and medical oncologists, as part of the multi-disciplinary cancer team.http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmentteam/index.aspx

[[Linear particle accelerator]]
CATEGORIES: Accelerator physics, Types of magnets, X-rays

A linear particle accelerator (often shortened to linac) is a type of particle accelerator that greatly increases the velocity of charged subatomic particles or ions by subjecting the charged particles to a series of oscillating electric potentials along a linear beamline; this method of particle acceleration was invented by Leó Szilárd. It was patented in 1928 by Rolf Widerøe,[tpl]cite journal|last = Widerøe|first = R.|authorlink=Rolf Widerøe |date = 17 December 1928 |title=Ueber Ein Neues Prinzip Zur Herstellung Hoher Spannungen|journal = Archiv fuer Elektronik und Uebertragungstechnik|volume = 21|number = 4|pages = 387[/tpl] who also built the first operational device and was influenced by a publication of Gustav Ising.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ising|first=Gustav|authorlink=Gustav Ising|year=1928|title=Prinzip Einer Methode Zur Herstellung Von Kanalstrahlen Hoher Voltzahl|journal=Arkiv Fuer Matematik, Astronomi Och Fysik|volume=18|number=4[/tpl]
Linacs have many applications: they generate X-rays and high energy electrons for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy, serve as particle injectors for higher-energy accelerators, and are used directly to achieve the highest kinetic energy for light particles (electrons and positrons) for particle physics.
The design of a linac depends on the type of particle that is being accelerated: electrons, protons or ions. Linac range in size from a cathode ray tube (which is a type of linac) to the 2-mile (3.2 km) long linac at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, California.

He and Hone Heke successfully fought the British in the Flagstaff War in 1845–46.Belich, James. The New Zealand Wars. (Penguin Books, 1986)
He traced descent from Rāhiri and Nukutawhiti of the Ngātokimatawhaorua canoe, the ancestors of the Ngāpuhi.
He was born in the north of New Zealand into the Ngāti Hine hapu, one of the subtribes of the Ngāpuhi.

Almost twenty years later, in 1825, he was at the Battle of Te Ika-a-ranga-nui when it was Ngāpuhi's turn to slaughter Ngāti Whātua in an act of utu or revenge. He took a number of Ngāti Whātua captive and refused to hand them over to Hongi Hika, preferring instead to return them to their own people to whom he was related.[tpl]DNZB|Martin|Kene Hine Te Uira|1k4|Kawiti, Te Ruki ? - 1854|4 April 2011[/tpl]
Kawiti initially refused to sign the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, believing that it would inevitably lead to further European encroachment and the loss of Māori land. However he eventually yielded to pressure from his own people and signed the Treaty in May 1840, right at the top, above those chiefs who had signed earlier.
However he soon grew disenchanted with British law and supported Hone Heke in his protests against British rule. Hone Heke sought support from Kawiti and other leaders of the Ngāpuhi iwi by the conveying of ‘te ngākau’,[tpl]cite web| last = | first = | title= Māori Dictionary Online| publisher= John C Moorfield|year=2005|url=http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=ngakau+mahaki&n=1&sp=1|accessdate=19 Oct 2012[/tpl] the custom observed by those who sought help to settle a tribal grievance.[tpl]cite web| last = Kawiti| first =Tawai |title=Hekes War in the North | publisher=No. 16 Ao Hou, Te / The New World, National Library of New Zealand| pages =38–43|date = October 1956|url= http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao16TeA/c22-7.html| accessdate=10 Oct 2012[/tpl] Hone Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti worked out the plan to draw the Colonial forces into battle, with the opening provocations focusing on the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end Kororareka.

The conduct of the Flagstaff War appears to follow a strategy of drawing the Colonial forces into attacking a fortified pā, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire. Kawiti was the senior rangatira and appears to have had a key role in the strategic decisions as to the design of the strengthened defences of Pene Taui's pā at Ohaeawai and the design and construction of the new pā that was built at Ruapekapeka to engage the British forces.

[[Parody mass]]

CATEGORIES: Renaissance music, Masses (music)

A parody mass is a musical setting of the mass, typically from the 16th century, that uses multiple voices of another pre-existing piece of music, such as a fragment of a motet or a secular chanson, as part of its melodic material.  It is distinguished from the two other most prominent types of mass composition during the Renaissance, the cantus firmus and the paraphrase mass. "Parody" often has nothing to do with humor, as in the modern sense of the word; while in some cases bawdy secular songs were indeed used in composition of masses, equally often non-liturgical sacred music such as motets formed the basis for parody masses.  Instead of calling it a "parody mass", the term "Imitation mass" has been suggested as being both more precise and closer to the original usage, since the term "parody" is based on a misreading of a late 16th-century text.Lockwood, Grove, 1980
The parody mass was a very popular model during the Renaissance: Palestrina alone wrote some 50-odd examples, and by the first half of the 16th century this style was the dominant form. The Council of Trent, in a document dated September 10, 1562, banned the use of secular material, "...let nothing profane be intermingled ... banish from church all music which contains, whether in the singing or the organ playing, things that are lascivious or impure."Reese, p. 449.   However the reforms were most carefully followed only in Italy; in France, a change in taste had already brought about many of the wishes of the members of the Council, and in Germany they were largely ignored.
In its usual definition, the term parody mass only applies to masses where a  polyphonic fragment is used. Masses incorporating only one voice of the polyphonic source, treated not as a cantus firmus but elaborated and moving between different parts, are known as paraphrase masses.  
Parody techniques include adding or removing voices from the original piece, adding fragments of new material, or only using the fragment at the beginning of every part of the mass.  In his colossal 22-volume El melopeo y maestro of 1613, Italian music theorist Pietro Cerone gave some general guidelines for writing a parody mass:  each of the main sections of the mass should start with the beginning of the source; the interior section of the Kyrie should use a secondary motive; and some portions, for example the second and third Agnus Dei, should not be chained to the model but be freely composed.  He also recommended using as many subsidiary musical ideas from the model as possible.Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 609.
Some examples of early parody masses include the Missa Malheur me bat, Missa Mater Patris, and Missa Fortuna desperata of Josquin des Prez, and the Missa de Dringhs by Antoine Brumel.   By the middle of the 16th century, a high percentage of all masses composed used the parody technique.

Unsealed source radiotherapy relates to the use of soluble forms of radioactive substances which are administered to the body by injection or ingestion. Such substances are typically used for their biological properties, which are similar to their non-radioactive parent substance.
Sealed-source therapy, in which the radioisotope remains in a capsule or metal wire during therapy and is never allowed to dissolve in fluids, is usually referred to as brachytherapy
A review of the subject was published in 1999 by Wynn A. Volkert and Timothy J. Hoffman.Wynn A. Volkert and Timothy J. Hoffman, Therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals, Chemical Reviews 99(9) (1999); 2269–2292

[[Brachytherapy]]

CATEGORIES: Radiation therapy, Medical physics

Brachytherapy (from the Greek word βραχυς brachys, meaning "short-distance"), also known as internal radiotherapy, sealed source radiotherapy, curietherapy or endocurietherapy, is a form of radiotherapy where a radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment.  Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical, prostate, breast, and skin cancer and can also be used to treat tumours in many other body sites.
Brachytherapy can be used alone or in combination with other therapies such as surgery, External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) and chemotherapy.
Brachytherapy contrasts with unsealed source radiotherapy in which a therapeutic radioisotope is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue which requires destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue, but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place.[tpl]rp|Ch. 1[/tpl]
A key feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT - the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.[tpl]rp|Ch. 1[/tpl]
A course of brachytherapy can be completed in less time than other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and the treatment is often performed on an outpatient basis. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy reflect that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.
Brachytherapy represents an effective treatment option for many types of cancer. Treatment results have demonstrated that the cancer cure rates of brachytherapy are either comparable to surgery and EBRT, or are improved when used in combination with these techniques.[ref]

The Snowy Egret (Egretta thula) is a small white heron. It is the American counterpart to the very similar Old World Little Egret, which has established a foothold in the Bahamas.
Adults are typically [tpl]convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weigh [tpl]convert|375|g|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] They have a slim black bill and long black legs with yellow feet. The area of the upper bill, in front of the eyes, is yellow but turns red during the breeding season, when the adults also gain recurved plumes on the back, making for a "shaggy" effect. The juvenile looks similar to the adult, but the base of the bill is paler, and a green or yellow line runs down the back of the legs.
Their breeding habitat is large inland and coastal wetlands from the lower Great Lakes and southwestern United States to South America. The breeding range in eastern North America extends along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts from Maine to Texas, and inland along major rivers and lakes. They nest in colonies, often with other waders, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. Their flat, shallow nests are made of sticks and lined with fine twigs and rushes. Three to four greenish-blue, oval eggs are incubated by both adults. The young leave the nest in 20 to 25 days and hop about on branches near the nest before finally departing.
In warmer locations, some Snowy Egret are permanent residents; northern populations migrate to Central America and the West Indies. They may wander north after the breeding season, very rarely venturing to western Europe—the first bird sighted in Britain wintered in Scotland from 2001–2002.
The birds eat fish, crustaceans, insects and small reptiles. They stalk prey in shallow water, often running or shuffling their feet, flushing prey into view, as well "dip-fishing" by flying with their feet just over the water. Snowy Egrets may also stand still and wait to ambush prey, or hunt for insects stirred up by domestic animals in open fields.
At one time, the beautiful plumes of the Snowy Egret were in great demand by market hunters as decorations for women's hats. This reduced the population of the species to dangerously low levels. [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Now protected in the USA by law, under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, this bird's population has rebounded.

CATEGORIES: Cognition, Cognitive neuroscience, Neuropsychology

Neurocognitive functions are cognitive functions closely linked to the function of particular areas, neural pathways, or cortical networks in the brain substrate layers of neurological matrix at the cellular molecular level. Therefore, their understanding is closely linked to the practice of neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience, two disciplines that broadly seek to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to perception defragmentation of concepts, memory embed, association and recall both in the thought process and behaviour.
A neurocognitive deficit is a reduction or impairment of cognitive function in one of these areas, but particularly when physical changes can be seen to have occurred in the brain, such as after neurological illness, mental illness, drug use, or brain injury.
A clinical neuropsychologist may specialise in using neuropsychological tests to detect and understand such deficits, and may be involved in the rehabilitation of an affected person. Some  neuropsychologist however adopt non-invasive procedures such as the cognitive matrix level (CML) cognitive psychotherapists. The discipline that studies neurocognitive deficits to infer normal psychological function is called cognitive neuropsychology.

Field Marshal Julian Hedworth George Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy [tpl]Post-nominals|post-noms=GCB GCMG MVO DCO[/tpl] (11 September 1862 – 6 June 1935) was a British Army officer who served as Governor General of Canada, the 12th since Canadian Confederation.
Known to friends as "Bungo", he was born to a noble family in Hertsmere, England, and educated at Eton College, along with his brothers. Upon graduation, Byng received a commission as a militia officer and thereafter saw service in Egypt and Sudan before he enrolled in the Staff College at Camberley. There, he befriended individuals who would be his contemporaries when he attained senior rank in France. Following distinguished service during World War I—specifically, with the British Expeditionary Force in France, in the Battle of Gallipoli, as commander of the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge, and as commander of the British Third Army—Byng was in 1919 himself elevated to the peerage. He was in 1921 appointed as governor general by King George V, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George, to replace the Duke of Devonshire as viceroy, and occupied that post until succeeded by the Viscount Willingdon in 1926. Byng proved to be popular with Canadians, due to his war leadership, though his stepping directly into political affairs became the catalyst for widespread changes to the role of the Crown in all of the British Dominions.
After the end of his viceregal tenure, Byng returned to the United Kingdom and there served as the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and was promoted within the peerage to become Viscount Byng of Vimy. Three years after being appointed as a field-marshal, Byng died at his home on 6 June.

[[Fat client]]
CATEGORIES: Computing output devices, Microcomputers, Networking hardware

A fat client (also called heavy, rich, or thick client) is a computer (client) in client–server architecture or networks that typically provides rich functionality independent of the central server. Originally known as just a "client" or "thick client"http://www.techterms.com/definition/thickclient the name is contrasted to thin client, which describes a computer heavily dependent on a server's applications.
A fat client still requires at least periodic connection to a network or central server, but is often characterised by the ability to perform many functions without that connection. In contrast, a thin client generally does as little processing as possible and relies on accessing the server each time input data needs to be processed or validated.

Jedda (1955) was the last movie made by the Australian filmmaker Charles Chauvel. The film is most notable for being the first to star two Aboriginal actors (Robert Tudawali and Ngarla Kunoth) in the leading roles, and also to be the first Australian feature film shot in colour.  Jedda is seen by some as an influential film in early Australian cinema, as it set a standard for future Australian films.  It won more international attention than previous Australian films, during a time when Hollywood films were dominating the Australian cinema. The director, Charles Chauvel, was nominated for the Golden Palm Award in the 1955 Cannes Film Festival,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Jedda |accessdate=1 February 2009|work=festival-cannes.com[/tpl] but lost to the American Delbert Mann for Marty.

[[California, Buckinghamshire]]
CATEGORIES: Aylesbury, Hamlets in Buckinghamshire

California is a hamlet to the south side of Aylesbury town centre in Buckinghamshire in England, although today it has been completely swallowed up by the urban growth of Aylesbury.Streetmap.co.uk, with the arrow pointing to the location of California
Until the arrival of the Great Western Railway in Aylesbury in 1839, California was the name of a farm and related buildings that stood in the area.  However with the arrival of the railway, cottages were constructed in the location of the farm to house railway workers and the area became known as the Hamlet of California.
By the early 1920s Aylesbury had grown such that it was necessary to start building houses on the site of Southcourt (the other side of California from Aylesbury), and so California and the associated farmlands that surrounded it became part of Aylesbury town. Eventually the farmlands themselves were built on, though the railway cottages that formed the hamlet remain.
The site was home to the "California Industrial Estate" until 2005 when it was demolished to make way for a new housing estate, renamed the "Grand Central" due to its proximity to the centre of Aylesbury. As of November 2006 the building work has nearly finished and it is likely that the hamlet will be forgotten about as it has been completely swamped by Aylesbury's development. 
The hamlet is probably named after the U.S. state of California, though its history goes back long before the state was known to British people. The name of the original farm was therefore most likely changed to California at some point before 1839. It is widely believed that the hamlet was named after visiting American servicemen during the Second World War; however, 19th-century maps prove this to be incorrect.Old-maps.co.uk

[[The History of Cardenio]]
CATEGORIES: 1613 plays, English Renaissance plays, Lost plays, Works based on Don Quixote, Shakespeare Apocrypha, Plays by John Fletcher (playwright)

The History of Cardenio, often referred to as merely Cardenio, is a lost play, known to have been performed by the King's Men, a London theatre company, in 1613.Chambers, E. K. The Elizabethan Stage. 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923. Vol 2, page 17. The play is attributed to William Shakespeare and John Fletcher in a Stationers' Register entry of 1653. The content of the play is not known, but it was likely to have been based on an episode in Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote involving the character Cardenio, a young man who has been driven mad and lives in the Sierra Morena. Thomas Shelton's translation of the First Part of Don Quixote was published in 1612, and would thus have been available to the presumed authors of the play.
It has been recently claimed that a surviving copy of The History of Cardenio has been found, and that a deal is in the works for James Franco to play Cardenio.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/16/shakespeares-lost-play-di_n_500592.html. Two plays have been put forward as being related to the lost play. Also, a song, "Woods, Rocks and Mountains", set to music by Robert Johnson, has been linked to it.Richard Wilson, Secret Shakespeare: studies in theatre, religion and resistance, Manchester University Press 2004 (p.233 on Google books). This source refers to Michael Wood's claims regarding Shakespeare's authorship of "Woods, rocks, and mountains".

[[Postage stamps and postal history of India]]

CATEGORIES: Postal system of India, Philately of India

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of India.
Indian postal systems for efficient military and governmental communications had developed long before the arrival of Europeans. When the Portuguese, Dutch, French, Danish and British displaced the Mughals, their postal systems existed alongside those of many somewhat independent states. The British East India Company gradually displaced other powers and brought into existence a British administrative system over most of India, with a need to establish and maintain both official and commercial mail systems.
Although the Indian Post Office was established in 1837, Asia's first adhesive stamp, the Scinde Dawk, was introduced in 1852 by Sir Bartle Frere, the British East India Company's administrator of the province of Sind. The Indian postal system developed into an extensive, dependable and robust network providing connectivity to almost all parts of India, Burma, the Straits Settlements and other areas controlled by the British East India Company (EIC). Based on the model postal system introduced in England by the reformer, Rowland Hill, efficient postal services were provided at a low cost and enabled the smooth commercial, military and administrative functioning of the EIC and its successor, the British Raj. The Imperial Posts co-existed with the several postal systems maintained by various Indian states, some of which produced stamps for use within their respective dominions, while British Indian postage stamps were required for sending mail beyond the boundaries of these states. Telegraphy and telephony made their appearance as part of the Posts before becoming separate departments. After the Independence of India in 1947, the Indian postal service continues to function on a countrywide basis and provides many valuable, low cost services to the public of India.

Postal history is the study of postal systems and how they operate and, or, the study of the use of postage stamps and covers and associated postal artifacts illustrating historical episodes in the development of postal systems. The term is attributed to Robson Lowe, a professional philatelist, stamp dealer and stamp auctioneer, who made the first organised study of the subject in the 1930s and described philatelists as "students of science", but postal historians as "students of humanity".[tpl]cite book | first=Vivien J. | last=Sussex | year=1988 | title=Introducing Postal History | chapter=1 | page=5| publisher=British Philatelic Trust in conjunction with The Postal History Society, London [/tpl]  More precisely, philatelists describe postal history as the study of rates, routes, markings, and means (of transport).

[[Wobble board]]
CATEGORIES: Lamellophones, Australian musical instruments

The wobble board is an instrument popularized by the Australian musician and artist Rolf Harris and featured in his best-known song "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport". A wobble board, like some other musical instruments, can be ornately decorated as its large surface area can act as a canvas without detracting from its musical capability. 
The instrument is played by holding the board lengthwise, hands at the sides and flicking the board outward, making the characteristic "whoop-whoop" noise. The angle the board is held at and the way the board is "flicked" can alter the timbre of the wobble board. It is similar to the boards used to imitate the sound of thunder in the theatre of Shakespeare's time.
Official Rolf Harris wobble boards were sold commercially for a time in the 1970s but most are made by the player. Almost any large, springy and flexible sheet of material can be used as an impromptu wobble board, although some materials are markedly better than others. Harris's instrument was originally made from a type of wood composite known as hardboard (Masonite in the United States and Australia). According to an interview he gave to Tony Barrell for The Sunday Times Magazine in 2001, Rolf discovered the musical properties of hardboard by chance, when he was about to paint a portrait of the conjurer Robert Harbin in 1959. Before his subject arrived, Rolf prepared the background, covering a large piece of hardboard with Prussian blue oil paint mixed with turpentine. But the surface refused to dry. "It was all sticky and nasty. He was due to arrive in about half an hour." In desperation, Harris propped the board over a paraffin heater. When he touched it later, it was so hot it burned his finger. "So I propped it between the palms of my hands and shook it to cool it down. And ... I thought, 'What a marvellous sound.'"
Rolf Harris said:The Rolf Harris Official Website
A wobble board used by Rolf for more than 40 years is now part of the National Museum of Australia collection.

The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian Armed Forces. The presidential system was established in 1889, upon the proclamation of the republic in a military coup d'état against Emperor Dom Pedro II. Since then, Brazil had six constitutions, two dictatorships and three democratic periods. During these democratic periods, voting has always been compulsory. The Brazilian constitution of 1988, along with several constitutional amendments, establishes the requirements, powers, and responsibilities of the president, as well as the term of office and method of election.Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, art. 15 and Chapter II

CATEGORIES: Political parties established in 1936, Second Spanish Republic, Political parties in Spain, Communist Party of Spain, Popular fronts, Political parties disestablished in 1939

The Popular Front ([tpl]lang-es|Frente Popular[/tpl]) in Spain's Second Republic was an electoral coalition and pact signed in January 1936 by various left-wing political organisations, instigated by Manuel Azaña for the purpose of contesting that year's election.
The Popular Front included the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Communist Party of Spain (PCE), the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM, independent communist) and the republicans: Republican Left (IR), (led by Azaña) and Republican Union Party (UR), led by Diego Martínez Barrio. This pact was supported by Galician (PG) and Catalan nationalists (ERC), socialist union Workers' General Union (UGT), and the anarchist trade union, the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Many anarchists who would later fight alongside Popular Front forces during the Spanish Civil War did not support them in the election, urging abstention instead.
The Joseph Stalin-controlled Comintern had decided in 1935 that, in response to the growth of Fascism, popular fronts allying Communist parties with other anti-Fascist parties including Socialist and even bourgeois parties were advisable. In Spain, it was a coalition between leftist republicans and workers' organizations to defend social reforms of the first government (1931–1933) of the Second Spanish Republic, and liberate the prisoners, political prisoners according with the front propaganda, held since the Asturian October Revolution (1934).
The Popular Front defeated the National Front (a collection of right-wing parties) and won the 1936 election, forming the new Spanish Government. Manuel Azaña was elected President of the Republic on May 1936, but the PSOE didn't join the government because of the opposition of Francisco Largo Caballero.
In July 1936, Francisco Franco and other conservative/monarchist generals instigated a coup d'état which started the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). The Government dissolved the Spanish Republican Army in the loyal territory and brought weapons to armed groups organized by the unions (UGT and CNT) and workers' parties (PSOE, PCE, POUM) that had initial success in defeating the Francoist forces in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia. In October the same year, the Spanish Republican Army was reorganized. After a protracted war of attrition Franco would defeat the Republican forces and rule Spain as a dictatorship until he died in 1975.

[[Ultraproduct]]

CATEGORIES: Model theory, Universal algebra, Non-standard analysis

The ultraproduct is a mathematical construction that appears mainly in abstract algebra and in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic. An ultraproduct is a quotient of the direct product of a family of structures. All factors need to have the same signature. The ultrapower is the special case of this construction in which all factors are equal.
For example, ultrapowers can be used to construct new fields from given ones. The hyperreal numbers, an ultrapower of the real numbers, are a special case of this.
Some striking applications of ultraproducts include very elegant proofs of the compactness theorem and the completeness theorem, Keisler's ultrapower theorem, which gives an algebraic characterization of the semantic notion of elementary equivalence, and the Robinson-Zakon presentation of the use of superstructures and their monomorphisms to construct nonstandard models of analysis, leading to the growth of the area of non-standard analysis, which was pioneered (as an application of the compactness theorem) by Abraham Robinson.

The Prime Minister is also the chair of the Cabinet of Thailand. The post has existed since the Revolution of 1932, when the country became a constitutional monarchy.
The Prime Minister is appointed by a vote in the Thai House of Representatives by a simple majority, and is then sworn-in by the King of Thailand. The House's selection is usually based on the fact that either the prime minister is the leader of the largest political party in the lower house or the leader of the largest coalition of parties. In accordance with the constitution, the prime minister can only be appointed twice and is therefore limited to a maximum of two consecutive terms. The incumbent PM is Yingluck Shinawatra, leader of the Pheu Thai Party. She has held the position since 5 August 2011.

Richard Sambrook (born 24 April 1956) is Professor of Journalism and Director of the Centre for Journalism at Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies (Cardiff University).  For 30 years, until February 2010, he was a BBC journalist and news executive. He spent ten years on the management board of the BBC becoming successively Director of BBC Sport, BBC News and, latterly, Director of BBC World Service and Global News. From 2010 until 2012 he was Global Vice Chairman and Chief Content Officer of the Edelman public relations agency.
Sambrook was educated at Maidstone Technical High School, at the University of Reading (BA in English) and at Birkbeck College, University of London (MSc in politics). His career began in local newspapers in South Wales. 
His time at the BBC was almost entirely in daily news. He was a programme editor, news editor and, later, Head of Newsgathering when the Corporation won a number of awards for its international news coverage. He merged radio and television news, and domestic and World Service newsgathering during this time, resulting in the world's largest broadcast news operation. He was acting Director of Sport in 2000, and became Director of News in 2001.
Sambrook defended in June/July 2003 what became the highly controversial Today programme report that the Blair government had in its September Dossier knowingly exaggerated claims relating to Iraq's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction. On 20 July, he confirmed that Dr. David Kelly had been the source of the news item. He later gave evidence to the Hutton Inquiry into Kelly's apparent suicide. 
Sambrook became Director of the World Service and Global News in September 2004. He oversaw major restructuring of the World Service, and its opening of Arabic and Persian television, as well as commercial interactive services. 
Since January 2010, he has been a Visiting Fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. 
He is a Trustee of the WWF-UK and of the International News Safety Institute for which he led an inquiry into the deaths of journalists around the world. 
From 2006-2009, he was Vice President of the European Broadcasting Union and represented public broadcasters on the advisory group to the UN's Internet Governance Forum. He was a member of the leadership committee of the Global Media AIDS Initiative, established by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2004. He was on the advisory board of the British Council and was formerly Chairman of the BBC's international charity, the World Service Trust, and a trustee of the free-speech NGO Article 19. He is a Fellow of the Royal Television Society and of the Royal Society of Arts.

Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul), also called the manul, is a small wild cat having a broad but patchy distribution in the grasslands and montane steppe of Central Asia. The species is negatively affected by habitat degradation, prey base decline, and hunting, and has therefore been classified as Near Threatened by IUCN since 2002.[tpl]IUCN |assessors=Ross, S., Murdoch, J., Mallon, D., Sanderson, J., Barashkova, A. |year=2008 |id=15640 |taxon=Otocolobus manul |version=2011.2[/tpl]
Pallas’s cat was named after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas, who first described the species in 1776 under the binomial Felis manul.Pallas, P. S. (1811). Felis Manul.

[[Drip brew]]

CATEGORIES: Coffee preparation

Drip brewing, or filtered coffee, is a method which involves pouring water over roasted, ground coffee beans contained in a filter, creating the beverage called coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its oils and essences, solely under gravity, then passes through the bottom of the filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter with the liquid falling (dripping) into a collecting vessel such as a carafe or pot.
Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908[tpl]cite web|title=The History of How We Make Coffee|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/coffee.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] and are commonly used for drip brew all over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by Gottlob Widmann, was patented in Germany being the first electrical drip brewer.[tpl]cite web|title=Sixty years of the Federal Republic of Germany – a retrospective of everyday life|url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/gb/lp/prj/mtg/typ/bun/en4922236.htminventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/coffee.htm|work=|accessdate=28 December 2012[/tpl] Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the percolators' tendency to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter.http://www.perfectcoffeemakers.com/History_Of_Coffee_Percolators.html One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and the filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter. Permanent filters are now also common, made of thin perforated metal sheets or fine plastic mesh that restrain the grounds but allow the coffee to pass, thus eliminating the need to have to purchase separate filters which sometimes cannot be found in some parts of the world. These add to the maintenance of the machine, but reduce overall cost and produce less waste.
Drip brewing is a widely used method of coffee brewing, particularly in North America owing to the popularity of domestic coffeemakers. There are, however, several manual drip-brewing devices on the market, offering a little more control over brewing parameters than automatic machines, and which incorporate stopper valves and other innovations that offer greater control over steeping time and the proportion of coffee to water. There also exist small, portable, single-serving drip brew makers that only hold the filter and rest on top of a mug or cup. Hot water is poured in and drips directly into the cup. 
Brewing with a paper filter produces clear, light-bodied coffee. While free of sediments, such coffee is lacking in some of coffee's oils and essences; they have been trapped in the paper filter."How to Use a Pour Over Brewer" CoffeeGeek.com. October 21, 2005.  Metal filters do not remove these components.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cornelis MC, El-Sohemy A |title=Coffee, caffeine, and coronary heart disease |journal=Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=745–51 |date=November 2007 |pmid=18089957 |doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e3282f05d81 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1363-1950&volume=10&issue=6&spage=745[/tpl]
It may be observed, especially when using a tall, narrow carafe, that the coffee at the bottom of the coffeepot is stronger than that at the top.  This is because less flavor is available for extraction from the coffee grounds as the brewing process progresses. A mathematical argument has been made that delivering comparable strength in two cups of coffee is nearly achieved using a  Thue-Morse sequence of pours.[tpl]cite journal|last=Richman|first=Robert|title=Recursive Binary Sequences of Differences|journal=Complex Systems|year=2001|volume=13|issue=4|pages=381–392|url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/13-4-3.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl] This analysis prompted a whimsical article in the popular press.[tpl]cite news|last=Abrahams|first=Marc|title=How to pour the perfect cup of coffee|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jul/13/perfect-coffee-improbable-research|accessdate=19 February 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2010[/tpl]
A less familiar form of drip brewing is the reversible or "flip" pot commonly known as Napoletana.

CATEGORIES: Telescopes, Optics

A rotating furnace is a device for making solid objects which have concave surfaces that are segments of axially symmetrical paraboloids. Usually, the objects are made of glass. The furnace makes use of the fact, which was known already to Newton, that the centrifugal-force-induced shape of the top surface of a spinning liquid is a concave paraboloid, identical to the shape of a reflecting telescope's primary focusing mirror.
They can be used in various ways, including (after being silvered) as primary mirrors in reflecting telescopes; they have also been used for solar cookers.http://solarcooking.org/research/SpinningParaboicConcentrators.htm

[[Prime Minister of Denmark]]

CATEGORIES: Prime Ministers of Denmark, Government ministerial offices of Denmark, History of Denmark

The Prime Minister of Denmark ([tpl]lang-da|statsminister[/tpl]; literally "Minister of State") is the head of government in the Kingdom of Denmark. Before the creation of the modern office, Denmark did not have a head of government separate from its head of state, namely the King, in whom the executive authority was vested. The Constitution of 1849 established a constitutional monarchy by limiting the powers of the Monarch and creating the office of [tpl]lang|da|premierminister[/tpl]. The inaugural holder of the office is Adam Wilhelm Moltke.
The Prime Minister presides over a cabinet that is formally appointed by the Monarch. In practice, the appointment of the Prime Minister is determined by their support in the Folketing (the national parliament). Since the beginning of the 20th century no single party has held a majority in the Folketing, so the Prime Minister must head a coalition of political parties, as well as their own party. Additionally, only four coalition governments since World War II have enjoyed a majority in the Folketing, so the coalitions (and the Prime Minister) must also gain loose support from other minor parties.
The current Prime Minister of Denmark is Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the first woman to hold the position. She leads a coalition government consisting of the Social Democrats and the Danish Social Liberal Party with parliamentary support from the Socialist People's Party and the Red-Green Alliance.

While the office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems, the Italian prime minister has less authority than some of his counterparts. The prime minister is not authorized to request the dissolution of the Parliament of Italy or to dismiss ministers, and must receive a vote of approval from the Council of Ministers—which holds effective executive power—to execute most political activities.
The office was established by Articles 92 through to 96 of the current Constitution of Italy. The prime minister is appointed by the President of the Republic after each general election. Commonly referred to in Italy as premier, the right title of the office holder is Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, or just Presidente del Consiglio. The formal Italian order of precedence lists the office as being ceremonially the fourth most important Italian state office.

Modern cards even go as far as to include swatches of game worn memorabilia, autographs, and even DNA hair samples of their subjects.
Trading cards are traditionally associated with sports; baseball cards are especially well-known. Cards dealing with other subjects are often considered a separate category from sports cards, known as non-sports trading cards. These often feature cartoons, comic book characters, television series and film stills. In the 1990s, cards designed specifically for playing games became popular enough to develop into a distinct category, collectible card games. These tend to use either fantasy subjects or sports as the basis for game play.

The stalemate in the Afghan crisis continues throughout the year. Babrak Karmal's government rejects negotiations except on its own terms, and the Soviets show no desire to withdraw or reduce their military presence. Rebel resistance against the Soviet presence intensifies throughout the country, despite all-out efforts by the 85,000-strong Soviet force and the Afghan Army to curb it. There are reports of widespread fighting between the Mujahideen (Islamic guerrillas) and the security forces in vast areas stretching from Kandahar in the south to Badakhshan on the Soviet border. The presence of rebels brings reprisals from the Soviet forces, and helicopter gunship and artillery attacks devastate several villages. Although there are no official estimates, Soviet casualties are also believed to be heavy. Although Pakistan denies the allegation, there is said to be evidence of a regular arms flow to the Mujahideen inside Afghanistan from across the border.

[[Thought disorder]]

In psychiatry, thought disorder (TD) or formal thought disorder (FTD) refers to disorganized thinking as evidenced by disorganized speech.[tpl]cite book |author=Yudofsky, Stuart C.; Hales, Robert E. |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=1-58562-032-7 |oclc=49576699 |accessdate=[/tpl] Specific thought disorders include derailment, poverty of speech, tangentiality, illogicality, perseveration, neologism, and thought blocking.
Psychiatrists consider formal thought disorder as being one of two types of disordered thinking, with the other type being delusions. The latter involves "content" while the former involves "form". Although the term "thought disorder" can refer to either type, in common parlance it refers most often to a disorder of thought "form" also known as formal thought disorder.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Eugen Bleuler, who named schizophrenia, held that thought disorder was its defining characteristic.Colman, A. M. (2001) Oxford Dictionary of Psychology, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-860761-X However, formal thought disorder is not unique to schizophrenia or psychosis.

The Asian golden cat (Pardofelis temminckii, syn. Catopuma temminckii), also called the Asiatic golden cat and Temminck's cat, is a medium-sized wild cat of Southeastern Asia. In 2008, the IUCN classified Asian golden cats as Near Threatened, stating that the species comes close to qualifying as Vulnerable due to hunting pressure and habitat loss, since Southeast Asian forests are undergoing the world's fastest regional deforestation rates.[tpl]IUCN |assessors=Sanderson, J., Mukherjee, S., Wilting, A., Sunarto, S., Hearn, A., Ross, J., Khan, J.A. |year=2008 |id=4038 |taxon=Pardofelis temminckii |version=2011.2[/tpl]

[[Friedrich Bouterwek]]

Friedrich Ludewig Bouterwek (15 April 1766 – 9 August 1828), German philosopher and critic, was born to a mining director at Oker, today a district of Goslar in Lower Saxony, and studied law and philology under Christian Gottlob Heyne and Johann Georg Heinrich Feder at the University of Göttingen.
After he had finished his studies he was appointed to the Hanover Appellate Court, whilst, backed by Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim, he also gave his debut as an author under the pen name Ferdinand Adrianow in the Göttinger Musenalmanach published by Gottfried August Bürger. He returned to Göttingen as a lecturer in history, from 1790, however, he became a disciple of Immanuel Kant and published Aphorismen nach Kants Lehre vorgelegt (1793). In 1802 he became professor ordinarius of philosophy at Göttingen, where he remained till his death.
As a philosopher, he is interesting for his criticism of the theory of the "thing-in-itself" (Ding-an-sich, noumenon). For the pure reason, as described in the Kritik, the "thing-in-itself" can be only an inconceivable "something-in-general"; any statement about it involves the predication of Reality, Unity and Plurality, which belong not to the absolute thing but to phenomena. On the other hand, the subject is known by the fact of will, and the object by that of resistance; the cognizance of willing is the assertion of absolute reality in the domain of relative knowledge. This doctrine has since been described as absolute Virtualism.
Following this train of thought, Bouterwek left the Kantian position through his opposition to its formalism. In later life he inclined to the views of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, whose letters to him (published at Göttingen, 1868) shed much light on the development of his thought.
Bouterwek died in Göttingen.
His chief philosophical works are:
In these works he dissociated himself from the Kantian school. His chief critical work was the Geschichte der neuern Poesie und Beredsamkeit (Göttingen, 12 vols., 1801-1819), of which the history of Spanish literature has been published separately in French, Spanish and English. The Geschichte is a work of wide learning and generally sound criticism, but it is not of equal merit throughout. He also wrote three novels, Paulus Septimus (Halle, 1795), Graf Donamar (Göttingen, 1791) and Ramiro (Leipzig, 1804), and published a collection of poems (Göttingen, 1802).

[[Death on the Rock]]

CATEGORIES: ITV television programmes, 1988 in Gibraltar, 1988 television films, Television series by FremantleMedia, British television films

"Death on the Rock" was a controversial television documentary produced by Thames Television,  part of the current affairs series This Week, broadcast on ITV on 28 April 1988. The programme examined the deaths of three Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) members in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988 at the hands of British special forces (codenamed "Operation Flavius"). "Death on the Rock" presented evidence that the IRA members were shot without warning or while attempting to surrender. It was condemned by the British government—who had attempted to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) postpone its broadcast—while tabloid newspapers accused it of sensationalism. After one of the documentary's witnesses retracted his evidence at the inquest into the shootings, Thames Television commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of "Death on the Rock"—the first such inquiry into a single television programme. The report largely vindicated "Death on the Rock", and found that it had, for the most part, accurately presented the evidence of its witnesses. Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished as a result of the Broadcasting Act 1990—decisions which many people believed were influenced by the government's anger at "Death on the Rock".
The project began after it emerged that the three IRA members shot in Gibraltar were found to be unarmed and not in possession of a bomb. The series' editor, Roger Bolton, dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary, to have the IBA postpone the broadcast. Using eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their hands up, or shot after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.
The morning after the broadcast, several tabloid newspapers attacked the documentary, accusing it of sensationalism and "trial by television". In the following days, they mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's main witnesses, in which they accused her of being a former prostitute and of being anti-British; Proetta later sued several newspapers for libel. Other newspapers accused "Death on the Rock" of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. The eyewitnesses interviewed for "Death on the Rock" gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings; most repeated the statements they had given the programme, but one witness—who had told the programme he had seen a soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground—retracted his previous statement. As a result of the retraction, Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of "Death on the Rock"—the first such inquiry into an individual programme. The Windlesham–Rampton report found that the programme's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed, but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion. The authors made several criticisms of the documentary, but overall found it a "trenchant" work of journalism, made in "good faith and without ulterior motives". Margaret Thatcher rejected the report's findings and within two years the government introduced the Broadcasting Act 1990, as a result of which Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished.

Isidora Dolores Ibárruri Gómez (9 December 1895[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]12 November 1989) — known as "La Pasionaria" (Spanish, "the Passionflower") — was a Spanish Republican leader of the Spanish Civil War and communist politician of Basque origin. She is perhaps best known for her defense of the Second Spanish Republic and the famous slogan ¡No Pasarán! ("They Shall Not Pass") during the Battle of Madrid.
The once Carlist Catholic young woman became a revolutionary militant, joining the Spanish Communist Party (PCE) when it was founded in 1921. In the 1930s, she became a writer for the PCE publication Mundo Obrero, and was elected to the Cortes as a PCE deputy for Asturias in February 1936 during the Second Republic. After her exile from Spain at the end of the Spanish Civil War, she was appointed General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain, a position she held from 1942 to 1960. She was then named honorary president of the PCE, a post she held for the rest of her life. Upon her return to Spain in 1977, she was reelected as a deputy to the Cortes for the same region she had represented during the Second Republic. She is usually regarded as one of the greatest public speakers of the 20th century.Vid. Oxford Dictionary, Speaker entry

Followers of Shaivam, called "Shaivas," and also "Saivas" or "Shaivites," believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. Shaivism is widespread throughout India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Areas notable for the practice of Shaivism include parts of Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.
Shaivism is the Hindu sect that worships the god Shiva. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Saivists are more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects, and may be found wandering India with ashen faces performing self-purification rituals.[tpl]cite web|title=ISKCON|url=http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1200.htm|accessdate=7 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Hindus in SA|url=http://www.hinduism.co.za/hindu3.htm|accessdate=7 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Dubois|title=Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies|publisher=Cosimo|page=111|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4zMY2qURR-8C&pg=PA111&dq=hindu+sects&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MLD0UpvBNsLulAXmq4C4DA&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=hindu%20sects&f=false[/tpl]They worship in the temple and practice yoga, striving to be one with Siva within.[tpl]cite web|title=HimalayanAcademy|url=http://www.himalayanacademy.com/readlearn/basics/four-sects|accessdate=7 February 2014[/tpl]

Joseph Story (September 18, 1779 – September 10, 1845) was an American lawyer and jurist who served on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1811 to 1845. He is most remembered for his opinions in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee and The Amistad case, and especially for his magisterial Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, first published in 1833. Dominating the field in the 19th century, this work is a cornerstone of early American jurisprudence. It is the first comprehensive treatise on the provisions of the U.S. Constitution and remains a critical source of historical information about the forming of the American republic and the early struggles to define its law.
Story opposed Jacksonian democracy, saying it was "oppression" of property rights by republican governments when popular majorities began (in the 1830s) to restrict and erode the property rights of the minority of rich men.David Brion Davis, Antebellum American culture (1997), pp. 14-15 R. Kent Newmyer presents Story as a "Statesman of the Old Republic" who tried to be above democratic politics and to shape the law in accordance with the republicanism of Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall and the New England Whigs of the 1820s and '30s, including Daniel Webster.Newmyer, p. 4 Historians agree that Justice Joseph Story reshaped American law—as much or more than Marshall or anyone else—in a conservative direction that protected property rights.Presser, p. 526

It has more than one million members and is the most successful union in labor elections, competing with the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) (historically affiliated with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party PSOE), with the syndicalist Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) usually a distant third.
The CCOO were organized in the 1960s by the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and workers' Roman Catholic groups to fight against the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, and for labor rights (in opposition to the non-representative "vertical unions" in the Spanish Trade Union Organisation). The various organizations formed a single entity after a 1976 Congress in Barcelona.
Along with other unions like the Unión Sindical Obrera (USO) and the UGT, it called a general strike in 1976, and carried out protests against the conditions in the country. Marcelino Camacho, a major figure of Spanish trade unionism and a PCE member, was CCOO's General Secretary from its foundation to 1985 - he was elected to the Congress of Deputies in the 1977 election.

In psychophysics, the Weber–Fechner law combines two different laws of human perception. Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878) was one of the first people to approach the study of the human response to a physical stimulus in a quantitative fashion.Ross, H.E. and Murray, D. J.(1996)(Ed. and Transl.) E.H.Weber on the tactile senses. 2nd ed. Hove: Erlbaum (UK) Taylor & Francis. Weber's law states that the just-noticeable difference between two stimuli is proportional to the magnitude of the stimuli, or, an increment is judged relative to the previous amount.[tpl]cite book |last=Pinker |first=Steven |date=2011 |title=The Better Angels Of Our Nature |location=P.265 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-141-03464-5[/tpl] Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801–1887), a scholar of Weber, later used Weber's findings to construct a psychophysical scale in which he described the relationship between the physical magnitude of a stimulus and its (subjectively) perceived intensity. Fechner's law (better referred to as Fechner's scale) states that subjective sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. Fechner scaling has been mathematically formalized. In fact, human perceptions of sight and sound work as follows: Perceived loudness/brightness is proportional to log10 (actual intensity measured with an accurate nonhuman instrument)
Some authors use the term "Weber–Fechner law" to mean Weber's law, and others use it for Fechner's law. The use of the term "Weber–Fechner law" was criticised as a misnomer by Ewald Hering [tpl]citation needed span|and should probably be deprecated.|date=February 2014[/tpl]

Charles Sumner (January 6, 1811 – March 11, 1874) was an American politician and senator from Massachusetts. An academic lawyer and a powerful orator, Sumner was the leader of the antislavery forces in Massachusetts and a leader of the Radical Republicans in the United States Senate during the American Civil War working to destroy the Confederacy, free all the slaves and keep on good terms with Europe. During  Reconstruction, he fought to minimize the power of the ex-Confederates and guarantee equal rights to the Freedmen.
Sumner changed his political party several times, gaining fame as a Republican.  He devoted his enormous energies to the destruction of what Republicans called the Slave Power, that is the efforts of slave owners to take control of the federal government and ensure the survival and expansion of slavery. In 1856, a South Carolina Congressman, Preston Brooks, nearly killed Sumner on the Senate floor two days after Sumner delivered an intensely anti-slavery speech called "The Crime against Kansas". In the speech, Sumner  characterized the attacker's cousin, South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler, as a pimp for slavery.[tpl]cite book|author1=Judith N. McArthur|author2=Orville Vernon Burton|title="A Gentleman and an Officer": A Military and Social History of James B. Griffin's Civil War|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZRDsgcnbqr8C&pg=PA40|year=1996|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=40[/tpl]   The episode played a major role in the coming of the Civil War.  During the war Sumner was a leader of the Radical Republican faction that criticized President Abraham Lincoln for being too moderate on the South.  One of the most learned statesmen of the era, he specialized in foreign affairs, and worked closely with Abraham Lincoln to keep the British and the French from intervening on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War. Sumner's expertise and energy made him a powerful chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
As the chief Radical leader in the Senate during Reconstruction, 1865–1871, Sumner fought hard to provide equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen on the grounds that "consent of the governed" was a basic principle of American republicanism, and to block ex-Confederates from power so they would not reverse the North's victory in the Civil War. Sumner, teaming with House leader Thaddeus Stevens, battled Andrew Johnson's reconstruction plans and sought to impose a Radical program on the South. Although Sumner forcefully advocated the annexation of Alaska in the Senate, he was against the annexation of the Dominican Republic, then known by the name of its capital, Santo Domingo.  After leading Senators to defeat President Ulysses S. Grant's Santo Domingo Treaty in 1870, Sumner broke with Grant, and denounced him in such terms that reconciliation was impossible.  In 1871, President Grant and his Secretary of State Hamilton Fish retaliated; through Grant's supporters in the Senate, Sumner was deposed as head of the Foreign Relations Committee.  Sumner had become convinced that Grant was a corrupt despot and that the success of Reconstruction policies called for new national leadership.  Sumner bitterly opposed Grant's reelection by supporting the Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley in 1872 and lost his power inside the Republican Party.  Less than two years later, he died in office.

Whoracle is the third album by Swedish melodic death metal band In Flames. The album was released through Nuclear Blast on 27 October 1997.  Apart from "Everything Counts", which is a cover of a Depeche Mode song, all songs were composed and arranged by In Flames. The lyrics were translated by Dark Tranquillity guitarist Niklas Sundin, after Anders Fridén had written them in Swedish. Whoracle is the final album to have Johan Larsson & Glenn Ljungström.
The album was recorded during the spring of 1997, and the title is a portmanteau of the English words "whore" and "oracle". Fredrik Nordström noted that this album was not easy to record at times, relating that the band members usually preferred drinking beer and playing Tekken 3 to recording the album.

[[Telomerase]]

CATEGORIES: Telomere-related proteins, Ageing, EC 2.7.7, DNA replication, Gerontology, Senescence, Telomeres, Aging-related proteins, Aging-related enzymes, Anti-aging substances

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that is an enzyme that adds DNA sequence repeats ("TTAGGG" in all vertebrates) to the 3' end of DNA strands in the telomere regions, which are found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. This region of repeated nucleotide called telomeres contains noncoding DNA and hinders the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. As a result, every time the chromosome is copied, only 100–200 nucleotides are lost, which causes no damage to the organism's DNA. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that carries its own RNA molecule, which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres, which are shortened after each replication cycle.
The existence of a compensatory mechanism for telomere shortening was first predicted by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973,[tpl]cite journal | author = Olovnikov AM | title = A theory of marginotomy.

[[Industrial society]]

CATEGORIES: Theories of history, Sociocultural evolution, Industry

In sociology, industrial society refers to a society driven by the use of technology to enable mass production, supporting a large population with a high capacity for division of labour. Such a structure developed in the west in the period of time following the Industrial Revolution, and replaced the agrarian societies of the Pre-modern, Pre-industrial age. Industrial societies are generally mass societies, and may be succeeded by an Information society. They are often contrasted to with the traditional societies.S. Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B. Baltes, Editor(s)-in-Chief, International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, Pergamon, Oxford, 2001, Pages 15829-15833, ISBN 978-0-08-043076-8, [tpl]doi|10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3[/tpl].

Industrial society is characterized by the use of external energy sources, such as fossil fuels, to increase the rate and scale of production.[tpl]cite web |url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/98/04717398/0471739898.pdf |title=Chapter 1 |accessdate=2007-12-18 |format=pdf [/tpl] The production of food is shifted to large commercial farms where the products of industry, such as combine harvesters and fossil fuel based fertilizers, are used to decrease required human labor while increasing production. No longer needed for the production of food, excess labor is moved into these factories where mechanization is utilized to further increase efficiency. As populations grow, and mechanization is further refined, often to the level of automation, many workers shift to expanding service industries.
Industrial society makes urbanization desirable, in part so that workers can be closer to centers of production, and the service industry can provide labor to workers and those that benefit financially from them, in exchange for a piece of production profits with which they can buy goods. This leads to the rise of very large cities and surrounding suburban areas with a high rate of economic activity.
These urban centers require the input of external energy sources in order to overcome the diminishing returnsArthur, Brian: "Positive Feedbacks in the Economy", Scientific American, 262(92-99): Feb. 1990. of agricultural consolidation, due partially to the lack of nearby arable land, associated transportation and storage costs, and are otherwise unsustainable.[tpl]cite journal |last=McGranahan |first=Gordon |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=November 2003 |title=URBAN CENTERS: An Assessment of Sustainability |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=28 |issue= |pages=243–274 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.28.050302.105541 |last2=Satterthwaite |first2=David [/tpl] This makes the reliable availability of the needed energy resources high priority in industrial government policies.
Some theoreticians—namely Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells—argue that we are located in the middle of a transformation or transition from industrial societies to post-modern societies. The triggering technology for the change from an agricultural to an industrial organisation was steam power, allowing mass production and reducing the agricultural work necessary. Thus many industrial cities are built around rivers. Identified as catalyst or trigger for the transition to post-modern or informational society is global information technology.

The album saw a major change in musical style and was In Flames' first considerable step in the direction of mainstream music, and was met with rejection among many of their fanbase. It is sometimes viewed as a transitional album between Clayman and Soundtrack to Your Escape.  The album's more accessible sound attracted many new fans and popularized In Flames' name within the US metal scene, helping to secure a top spot at Ozzfest. The album peaked at #13 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart.[tpl]cite web|title=Billboard Independent charts|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=in flames|chart=Independent Albums[/tpl]|accessdate=27 May 2013[/tpl]  This was the band's first album to present singles which were "Trigger" and "Cloud Connected".

[[Alaskan Husky]]

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Sled dog breeds, Dog breeds originating in the United States

The Alaskan husky is a type, or a category of dog. It falls short of being a pure breed in that there is no preferred type of and no restriction as to ancestry; it is defined only by its purpose, which is that of a highly efficient sled dog. Specializations in type exist within the category, such as freighting dogs (Mackenzie River husky, Malamute), sprint Alaskans (Eurohound), and distance Alaskans. Most Alaskan Huskies have pointy ears and a tail that curls over their backs, meaning they are in fact classified as a spitz-type dog.The huskies life span is to 10 or 15 years.
The Alaskan Husky does have a unique genetic signature of microsatellite-based markers that are more consistent than those found in Malamutes or Siberians.
The Alaskan is the sled dog of choice for world-class dog sled racing sprint competition. None of the purebred northern breeds can match it for sheer racing speed. Demanding speed-racing events such as the Fairbanks, Alaska Open North American Championship and the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous are invariably won by teams of Alaskan huskies, or of Alaskans crossed with hounds or gun dogs. Hounds are valued for their toughness and endurance. Winning speeds often average more than [tpl]convert|19|mph|km/h[/tpl] over three days' racing at [tpl]convert|20|to|30|mi|km[/tpl] each day. 
Alaskan huskies that fulfill the demanding performance standards of world-class dogsled racing are extremely valuable. A top-level racing lead dog can be worth $10,000–$15,000. Alaskans that fail to meet the performance standards of the musher who bred them often go on to be sold to less competitive mushers, allowing them to continue to run.

The Serpentine (also known as the Serpentine River) is a [tpl]convert|40|acre|ha[/tpl] recreational lake in Hyde Park, London, England, created in 1730 at the behest of Queen Caroline. Although it is common to refer to the entire body of water as The Serpentine, strictly the name refers only to the eastern half of the lake. Serpentine Bridge, which marks the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, also marks The Serpentine's western boundary; the long and narrow western half of the lake is known as The Long Water. The Serpentine takes its name from its snakelike, curving shape,[tpl]cite web |title=Hyde Park & Kensington Gardens Stroll |publisher=Urban75 |date=November 2006 |url=http://www.urban75.org/london/hyde-park-london.html |accessdate=11 September 2007[/tpl] although it only has one bend.
Originally fed by the River Westbourne and Tyburn Brook in the 1730s, the lake's water was then pumped from the Thames in the 1830s. The water is now pumped from three boreholes within Hyde Park, the most recent being installed in May 2012 as part of the 2011–2012 restoration of the Lake. The Serpentine provided a focal point for The Great Exhibition of 1851, and more recently was a venue for the men's and women's triathlon and marathon swimming events in the London 2012 Olympics. Since 1864 the Serpentine Swimming Club has organised a 100-yard race every Christmas morning for the Peter Pan Cup, inaugurated by J. M. Barrie, the creator of the fictional character Peter Pan.
There are many recreational facilities around The Serpentine, as well as boating on the lake itself. In 1860 The Serpentine was to be modified into a skating pond with formal edges. This scheme was not implemented. Among the landmarks near the lake is the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain.

[[American Cocker Spaniel]]
CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Spaniels, Sporting dogs, Dog breeds originating in the United States

The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of sporting dog. It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin. The word cocker is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while spaniel is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain.
The first spaniel in America came across with the Mayflower in 1620, but it was not until 1878 that the first Cocker Spaniel was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). A national breed club was set up three years later and the dog considered to be the father of the modern breed, Ch. Obo II, was born around this time. By the 1920s the English and American varieties of Cocker had become noticeably different and in 1946 the AKC recognised the English type as a separate breed. It was not until 1970 that The Kennel Club in the UK recognised the American Cocker Spaniel as being separate from the English type. The American Cocker was the most popular breed in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s and again during the 1980s, reigning for a total of 18 years. They have also won the best in show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on four occasions, and have been linked to the President of the United States on several occasions, with owners including Richard Nixon and Harry S. Truman.
The breed is the smallest of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognisable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer from a wide variety of health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.

Together with the similar article for Chief Executive, the universal suffrage of the Legislative Council and Chief Executive has become the most dominant issue of the Hong Kong politics.

[[Electronic test equipment]]
CATEGORIES: Electronic test equipment

Electronic test equipment (sometimes called "testgear" or "bench top") is used to create signals and capture responses from electronic Devices Under Test (DUTs). In this way, the proper operation of the DUT can be proven or faults in the device can be traced. Use of electronic test equipment is essential to any serious work on electronics systems.
Practical electronics engineering and assembly requires the use of many different kinds of electronic test equipment ranging from the very simple and inexpensive (such as a test light consisting of just a light bulb and a test lead) to extremely complex and sophisticated such as Automatic Test Equipment. ATE often includes many of these instruments in real and simulated forms.
Generally, more advanced test gear is necessary when developing circuits and systems than is needed when doing production testing or when troubleshooting existing production units in the field.

Francisco Frutos Gras (Calella, Barcelona, 6 September 1939) is a Spanish politician who was since 1998 until 2009, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE).
A son of peasants, Frutos worked until the age of 25 in agriculture, emigrating later to Germany, and then returning to Barcelona, where he was touched for the first time by trade unionism in a textile factory in Blanes. There he was an organiser of the then-clandestine Workers' Commissions (CCOO). In 1963, Frutos joined the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC), the fraternal party of PCE in Catalonia. In the 1970s he was elected organisational secretary of the Workers' Commission of Catalonia, and represented the union in the Assembly of Catalonia. Frutos was also a member of the Confederation Executive Committee of CCOO. In 1980, Frutos was elected a member of the Parliament of Catalonia, and in 1981 General Secretary of PSUC. He would remain in those positions until 1982 and 1984, respectively. During that period Frutos oversaw different disputes between Leninists and eurocommunists, that led to the expulsion of the Leninist majority, including Chairman Pere Andarica, that would later become the Communists' Party of Catalonia.
After the resignation of Santiago Carrillo as General Secretary of PCE and the election of Gerardo Iglesias due to poor results in the 1982 elections, Frutos transferred to Madrid to work within the Structures of the Central Committee of the PCE. After the creation of United Left (IU) in 1986 Frutos was also a member of the Presidium of IU. In the 12th Congress of the PCE in 1988 Frutos was elected Organisational Secretary of the Party. In the 1993 elections, Frutos was elected a deputy for Madrid, and during the 13th Congress of PCE in 1995 Frutos rose to the position of Secretary of the Federal Committee, a position that substituted the position of Deputy General Secretary. In the 1996 elections Frutos was second on the Madrid List of the IU, and succeeded in being re-elected. In 1998, the then General Secretary of PCE and General Coordinator of IU Julio Anguita suffered a non fatal heart stroke, and, following that, he announced his intention to gradually abandon active politics. In December of that year the 14th Congress of PCE was convened, with Frutos elected to the position of General Secretary. In 1999, following Anguita's second stroke, Frutos was asked to be IU's Candidate for Prime Minister in the 2000 elections. Prior to the elections Frutos signed a polemic agreement with Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), then led by Joaquín Almunia. In those elections IU fell from 21 deputies to 8. Later in the Year Frutos unsuccessfully disputed IU's General Coordination to Gaspar Llamazares in the 6th Assembly of IU. Remaining as a deputy until 2004, Frutos was re-elected general Secretary of PCE in the 16th and 17th Congresses of PCE.

[[Bandage]]
CATEGORIES: First aid

A bandage is a piece of material used either to support a medical device such as a dressing or splint, or on its own to provide support to the body; it can also be used to restrict a part of the body. During heavy bleeding or following a poisonous bite, it is important to slow the flow of blood; tight bandages accomplish this task very well. Bandages are available in a wide range of types, from generic cloth strips to specialized shaped bandages designed for a specific limb or part of the body, although bandages can often be improvised as the situation demands, using clothing, blankets or other material.
In colloquial American English, the word "bandage" is often used to mean a dressing, which is used directly on a wound, whereas a bandage is technically only used to support a dressing, and not directly on a wound.

[[Stack (abstract data type)]]
CATEGORIES: Articles with example pseudocode, Abstract data types

In computer science, a stack is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the  principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of an entity to the collection, known as push and removal of an entity, known as pop.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/ap/subset/doc/ap/Stack.html|title=Interface Stack|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=Feb 7, 2013[/tpl] The relation between the push and pop operations is such that  the stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. In a LIFO data structure, the last element added to the structure must be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that, considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection, the push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack. Often a peek or top operation is also implemented, returning the value of the top element without removing it.
A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is then considered to be in an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack. A pop either reveals previously concealed items or results in an empty stack, but, if the stack is empty, it goes into underflow state, which means no items are present in stack to be removed.
A stack is a restricted data structure, because only a small number of operations are performed on it. The nature of the pop and push operations also means that stack elements have a natural order. Elements are removed from the stack in the reverse order to the order of their addition. Therefore, the lower elements are those that have been on the stack the longest.http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/computersciencetheory/stack.html cprogramming.com

[[Stack (geology)]]
CATEGORIES: Stacks (geology), Coastal geography, Coastal and oceanic landforms

A stack or seastack is a geological landform consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock in the sea near a coast, formed by erosion.Easterbrook, D.J. "Surface Processes and Landforms", p. 442, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 1999. Stacks are formed over time by wind and water, processes of coastal geomorphology."Sea stacks" britannica.com They are formed when part of a headland is eroded by hydraulic action, which is the force of the sea or water crashing against the rock. The force of the water weakens cracks in the headland, causing them to later collapse, forming free-standing stacks and even a small island. Without the constant presence of water, stacks also form when a natural arch collapses under gravity, due to sub-aerial processes like wind erosion. Stacks can provide important nesting locations for seabirds, and many are popular for rock climbing.

[[IBM Portable Personal Computer]]

CATEGORIES: IBM personal computers, Portable computers

The IBM Portable Personal Computer 5155 model 68 was an early portable computer developed by IBM after the success of Compaq's suitcase-size portable machine (the Compaq Portable). It was released in February, 1984, and was eventually replaced by the IBM Convertible.
The Portable was basically a PC/XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style luggable case. The system featured 256 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 512 kB on the motherboard), an added CGA card connected to an internal monochrome (amber) composite monitor, and one or two half-height 5¼" 360 kB floppy disk drives. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA board and a 9" amber monochrome composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television. A separate 83-key keyboard and cable was provided.
If a bit less sophisticated than the Compaq Portable, IBM's machine had the advantage of a lower price tag. The motherboard had eight expansion slots. The power supply was rated 114 watts and was suitable for operation on either 120 VAC or 230 VAC. Scott Mueller, Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Second Edition, Que, 1992 ISBN 0-88022-856-3 pp. 76-81 Hard disks were a very common third-party add-on as IBM did not offer them from the factory.

The Land of Rape and Honey is the third studio album by industrial metal band Ministry, released in 1988 on Sire Records. This album is the band's first attempt at industrial metal, as opposed to their previous albums which were more electronically influenced.
The album title comes from the slogan of Tisdale, Saskatchewan, whose motto is "The Land of Rape and Honey", the local economy being based on the agricultural products rapeseed and honey.[tpl]cite web|last=Wolanski |first=Coreen |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=45&csid2=9&fid1=1605 |title=Ministry - Nothing Exceeds Like Excess • Timeline • |publisher=Exclaim!|date=2006-06-02 |accessdate=2012-02-27[/tpl]  The band chose the name after seeing the slogan on a souvenir mug.[tpl]cite web | url=http://reference.findtarget.com/search/Tisdale,%20Saskatchewan/ | title=Tisdale, Saskatchewan | publisher=Find Target | accessdate=June 8, 2010[/tpl]

The Gaussian gravitational constant is related to an expression which is the same for all bodies orbiting the Sun.

[[IBM PC Convertible]]

CATEGORIES: Portable computers, IBM laptops

The IBM PC Convertible, released April 3, 1986, was IBM's first laptop computer and was also the first IBM computer to use the 3.5" floppy disk which went on to become the standard. Like modern laptops, it featured power management and the ability to run from batteries.  It was the follow-up to the IBM Portable and was model number 5140. The concept and the design of the body was made by the German industrial designer Richard Sapper.
It used an Intel 80c88 CPU (a CMOS version of the Intel 8088) running at 4.77 MHz, 256 kB of RAM (expandable to 640 kB), dual 720 kB 3.5" floppy drives, and a monochrome CGA-compatible LCD screen at a price of $2,000.  It weighed 13 pounds (5.8 kg) and featured a built-in carrying handle.
The PC Convertible had expansion capabilities through a proprietary ISA bus-based port on the rear of the machine.  Extension modules, including a small printer and a video output module, could be snapped into place.  The machine could also take an internal modem, but there was no room for an internal hard disk.
Pressing the power button on the computer did not turn it off, but put the machine into a "suspend" mode.  This avoided the long process of booting up.  The CMOS 80c88 CPU has a static core, which means that it can be stopped simply by stopping the system clock oscillator that is driving it, and it will hold its state indefinitely and resume processing at the point it was stopped when the clock signal is restarted, as long as it is kept powered.  CMOS circuits use extremely little power when they are not changing state, so an 80c88 that is on but not being clocked uses very little power.
The screen was not very tall, so text characters and graphics were compressed vertically, appearing about half their normal height.  The display was capable of resolutions of 80x25 (text), 640x200, and 320x200.  Pressing a lever between the two floppy drives just below the display detached the entire screen from the unit.  This feature allowed the convenient use of a full-size desktop monitor while at one's desk, an early forerunner of the "docking station" concept.
The machine sold very poorly for a number of reasons. The Convertible was heavy, not much faster than the Portable it replaced (despite the newer CMOS processor and use of static RAM), didn't come with traditional PC expansion ports (such as serial ports and a parallel port) without an add-on, and had a hard-to-read, oddly-shaped LCD screen (the first screens lacked a backlight). It also competed against faster portables based on the Intel 80286 that offered optional hard drives, from companies such as Compaq, and laptops from companies such as Toshiba and Zenith that were lighter and offered similar specifications, sometimes at half the price. The keyboard was also widely criticized.
It was replaced in 1991 by the IBM PS/2 L40 SX, and in Japan by the IBM Personal System/55note, which was the predecessor to the ThinkPad.

Quantitative marketing research is the application of quantitative research techniques to the field of marketing. It has roots in both the positivist view of the world, and the modern marketing viewpoint that marketing is an interactive process in which both the buyer and seller reach a satisfying agreement on the "four Ps" of marketing: Product, Price, Place (location) and Promotion.
As a social research method, it typically involves the construction of questionnaires and scales. People who respond (respondents) are asked to complete the survey. Marketers use the information so obtained to understand the needs of individuals in the marketplace, and to create strategies and marketing plans.

It is a national charity established in 1994 to build a brighter future for young people in sport. It was the brainchild of Sir John L. Beckwith, who wanted to ensure that all young people received a quality introduction to sport. He was also keen to channel the energy of young people in a particular direction. The key individual who drove the organisation in its formulative years was Sue Campbell who is now the Chair. Campbell was also previously Chair of UK Sport and is a non-political advisor to the government.
The Trust develops and implements, in close partnership with other organizations, quality physical education and sport programmes for all young people, aged eighteen months to eighteen years, in schools and community. Key features of TOP programmes are illustrated resource cards, child-friendly equipment and quality training for teachers and deliverers. All of the programmes can be accessed by young disabled people.
To provide the best in education, training, research and development for the benefit of all young people, the Beckwith Chair of Youth Sport was established in Loughborough University in November 1998.http://www.lboro.ac.uk/service/publicity/publications/newsatlboro/newsletter4.pdf news@lboro issue 4, p10 Roll of honour 28 October 2008
By the end of 1999, the Trust had reached over 3 million young people through its TOP programmes.
The trust also manages the UK School Games, an annual sporting competition for elite school age athletes established in 2006.

From March 1848 through November 1849, the Habsburg Austrian Empire was threatened by revolutionary movements. Much of the revolutionary activity was of a nationalist character: the empire, ruled from Vienna, included Austrian Germans, Hungarians, Slovenes, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Ruthenians (Ukrainians), Romanians, Croats, Italians, and Serbs, all of whom attempted in the course of the revolution to either achieve autonomy, independence, or even hegemony over other nationalities. The nationalist picture was further complicated by the simultaneous events in the German states, which moved toward greater German national unity.
Besides these nationalisms, liberal and even socialist currents resisted the empire's longstanding conservatism.
Ultimately, the revolutions failed, in part because the various revolutionaries had conflicting goals.

The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, also called the March Revolution (Märzrevolution), were part of the Revolutions of 1848 that broke out in many countries of Europe and a series of loosely coordinated protests and rebellions in the states of the German Confederation, including the Austrian Empire. The revolutions, which stressed pan-Germanism, emphasised popular discontent with the traditional, largely autocratic political structure of the thirty-nine independent states of the Confederation that inherited the German territory of the former Holy Roman Empire. Furthermore, they demonstrated the popular desire for increased political freedom, liberal state policies, democracy, nationalism, and freedom from censorship. The middle class elements were committed to liberal principles, while the working class sought radical improvements to their working and living conditions. However, the middle class and working class components of the Revolution split, and in the end the conservative aristocracy defeated it, forcing many liberals into exile, where they became known as Forty-Eighters.

[[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states]]

CATEGORIES: Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states

The 1848 revolutions in the Italian states were organized revolts in the states of the Italian peninsula and Sicily, led by intellectuals and agitators who desired a liberal government. As Italian nationalists they sought to eliminate reactionary  Austrian control. During this time period, Italy was not a unified country, and was divided into many states, which, in Northern Italy, were ruled by the Austrian Empire. A desire to be free from foreign rule, and the conservative leadership of the Austrians, led the Italian people to stage revolution in order to drive out the Austrians. The revolution was led by the state of Piedmont, one of the four states where the Austrian leaders were forced to grant liberal rights. Also, the uprisings in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, particularly in Milan, forced the Austrian General Radetsky to retreat to the Quadrilatero (Quadrilateral) fortresses.Priscilla Robertson, Revolutions of 1848: A Social History (1952) pp 311-401
King Charles Albert, who ruled Piedmont-Sardinia from 1831 to 1849, aspired to unite Italy under his leadership. He declared war on Austria and launched a full-out attack on the Quadrilateral. Lacking allies, Charles Albert was no match for the Austrian army. He was defeated at the Battle of Custoza (July 24, 1848), signed a truce, and withdrew his forces from Lombardy. Austria remained dominant in a divided Italy and the Revolution was lost.

[[Serbian Tricolour Hound]]
CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Scent hounds, Dog breeds originating in Serbia

The Serbian Tricolour Hound (srpski trobojni gonič or trobojac) is a breed of dog of the hound type. Formerly called the Yugoslavian Tricolour Hound, the name was changed for clarity after the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia in 1991. The breed was first exhibited at shows in 1950. At one time it was considered a variation of the Serbian Hound, but was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as a separate breed in 1961.Brief Historical Summary from the Fédération Cynologique Internationale Breed standard
The Serbian Tricolour Hound is a medium-large scenthound that was bred as a running hound (free running to seek game on its own, not on a leash.) It is used on feral pigs  or wild boar and other large game as well as hare and fox.
The Serbian Tricolour Hound is a devoted breed that loves its master without question and will loyally stand by him for all his life. It is a kind breed but also a tenacious hunter that performs very well in the field and has been a very successful hunting companion for many years.

[[Montenegrin Mountain Hound]]

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Mountain dogs, Rare dog breeds, Scent hounds

The Montenegrin Mountain Hound is a rare dog breed from the mountain regions across the Balkans. Black and tan, with a smooth coat, the Montenegrin Mountain Hound was called Black Hound in the past. We can say with certainty that this breed is of the same origin as the other Balkan hounds. He stands [tpl]convert|18|to|22|in|cm[/tpl] high and weighs [tpl]convert|44|to|55|lb|kg[/tpl]. The breed is used to hunt fox, hare, and small game, occasionally hunting larger animals such as deer or even wild boar.
The breed was formerly known as the Yugoslavian Mountain Hound; the FCI changed the name on July 15, 1997. The first standard dates back to 1924. The breed bears strong resemblance to the Austrian Black and Tan HoundPugnetti, Gino. Sve o psima by baroness Turković, Ksenija, Mladinska knjiga (Ljubljana) and Mladost (Zagreb), 1983. The breed was first officially recognized on May 8, 1969 in Warsaw. American Rare Breed Association considers the breed endangered.
Perhaps the most memorable popular depiction of the Montenegrin Mountain Hound (then called Yugoslavian Mountain Hound) had been as the hand puppet "Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog", regularly appearing on the NBC television show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Although the puppet displays physical characteristics of the breed, and was identified as such during many appearances, the caption identifying Triumph as a Yugoslavian Mountain Hound was promptly removed after NATO military attack ensued against FR Yugoslavia.

[[Marginal demand]]
CATEGORIES: Demand, Economics terminology

Marginal demand is the term in economics that refers to the change in demand for a product or service in response to a specific change in its price.
Normally, as prices for goods or service rise, marginal demand falls. And conversely, as prices for goods or services fall, marginal demand rises.
A product or service where price changes cause a relatively big change in marginal demand is said to have an elastic market. A product or service where price changes cause a relatively small change in marginal demand are said to have an inelastic market.

[[Ancient Greek religion]]

CATEGORIES: Polytheism, Religion in Greece, Ancient Greek religion, Ancient Greek culture

Greek religion (alternatively Hellenism, [tpl]lang-el|Ἑλληνισμός[/tpl]) encompasses the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or "cults" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities.
Many Greek people recognized the major (Olympian) gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia, and Hera though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshiped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.
The religious practices of the Greeks extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of Ionia in Asia Minor, to Magna Graecia (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as Massalia (Marseille). Greek religion was tempered by Etruscan cult and belief to form much of the later Ancient Roman religion.

He is of equal significance to other creatures such as Tianlong, the celestial dragon.
The spiritual dragons are azure-scaled and govern the wind, clouds and rain, on which all agricultural life depends.Shuker, Karl. (1995). Dragons. A Natural History.

Despite that, Shenlong appears to signify a special ranking in the splendid robes and regalia of Chinese emperors. He was also five-clawed and therefore an imperial dragon.

Abraham Alfonse Albert Gallatin (January 29, 1761 – August 12, 1849) was a Swiss-American ethnologist, linguist, founder of New York University, politician, diplomat, congressman, Senator and the longest-serving United States Secretary of the Treasury.  In 1831, he founded the University of the City of New York, now New York University.
Born in Geneva in present-day Switzerland, Gallatin immigrated to America in the 1780s, ultimately settling in Pennsylvania. He was politically active against the Federalist Party program, and was elected to the United States Senate in 1793. However, he was removed from office by a 14–12 party-line vote after a protest raised by his opponents suggested he did not meet the required nine years of citizenship. Two years later, he was elected to the House of Representatives and served in the fourth through sixth Congresses, becoming House Majority Leader. He was an important member of the new Democratic-Republican Party, its chief spokesman on financial matters, and led opposition to many of the policy proposals of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. He also helped found the House Committee on Finance (later the Ways and Means Committee) and often engineered withholding of finances by the House as a method of overriding executive actions to which he objected.  While Treasury Secretary, his services to his country were honored in 1805 when Meriwether Lewis named one of the three headwaters of the Missouri River after Gallatin.

Kerbdog (also sometimes known as 'Totally Switched' for the US release) is Kerbdog's eponymous debut album. The album was recorded in 1993 at Rockfield studios in Wales and released in 1994 through Vertigo. Though the band had various indy influences, with bands like Sonic Youth and Big Black, the album ended up having a Metallica influenced proto-grunge sound. The band said that this was simply the result of getting professional equipment, and turning everything up as loud as they could. What also might account for this is the fact that grunge pioneer Jack Endino recorded the album.
The album was fairly well received in Britain, Ireland, and Europe, reaching number 97 in the UK Albums Chart.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_K.HTM | title=UK Top 200 Charts History[/tpl] It also got a lot of radio play on US college radio, but the album didn't do as well as expected.

Videoconferencing is the conduct of a videoconference (also known as a video conference or videoteleconference) by a set of telecommunication technologies which allow two or more locations to communicate by simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. It has also been called 'visual collaboration' and is a type of groupware.
Videoconferencing differs from videophone calls in that it's designed to serve a conference or multiple locations rather than individuals.Mulbach et al, 1995. Pg. 291. It is an intermediate form of videotelephony, first used commercially in Germany during the late-1930s and later in the United States during the early 1970s as part of AT&T's development of Picturephone technology.
With the introduction of relatively low cost, high capacity broadband telecommunication services in the late 1990s, coupled with powerful computing processors and video compression techniques, videoconferencing has made significant inroads in business, education, medicine and media. Like all long distance communications technologies (such as phone and Internet), by reducing the need to travel to bring people together the technology also contributes to reductions in carbon emissions, thereby helping to reduce global warming.

In professional American football, the Pro Bowl is the all-star game of the National Football League (NFL). From the merger with the rival American Football League (AFL) in 1970 up through 2013, it was officially called the AFC–NFC Pro Bowl, matching the top players in the American Football Conference (AFC) against those in the National Football Conference (NFC).  Beginning in 2014, the teams will not be based on the two conferences, and will instead be chosen by two team captains in a televised fantasy draft four days prior to the game.
Unlike most other North American sports leagues, which hold their all-star games roughly midway through their respective regular seasons, the Pro Bowl is played around the end of the NFL season. Between the 1970 merger and 2009, it was usually held on the weekend after the Super Bowl. Since 2010, the Pro Bowl has been played on the weekend one week after the Conference Championship games, one week before the Super Bowl.

[[Reversed field pinch]]

CATEGORIES: Fusion power

A reversed-field pinch (RFP) is a device used to produce and contain near-thermonuclear plasmas.  It is a toroidal pinch which uses a unique magnetic field configuration as a scheme to magnetically confine a plasma, primarily to study magnetic fusion energy. Its magnetic geometry is somewhat different from that of the more common tokamak.  As one moves out radially, the portion of the magnetic field pointing toroidally (see inset) reverses its direction, giving rise to the term "reversed field".  This configuration can be sustained with comparatively lower fields than that of a tokamak of similar power density.  One of the disadvantages of this configuration is that it tends to be more susceptible to non-linear effects and turbulence.  This makes it a perfect laboratory for non-ideal (resistive) magnetohydrodynamics.  RFPs are also used in the study of astrophysical plasmas as they share many features.
The largest Reversed Field Pinch device presently in operation is called the Reversed-Field eXperiment (RFX) in Padua, Italy. Others include the Madison Symmetric Torus, EXTRAP T2R in Sweden, and TPE-RX in Japan.

The American Water Spaniel, (often abbreviated to AWS), is a breed of spaniel which is one of a small number of breeds originating in the United States. Developed in the state of Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the Irish and English Water Spaniels. The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, who set up the breed club and standard, and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club, and later, the American Kennel Club. While they are the state dog of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.
They are medium sized dog, and have a double layered coat, which comes in a variety of brown related shades. A versatile hunting dog, they are also suitable for apartment life due to work by breeders to develop a breed with an even temperament. The AWS may have been involved in the development of the Boykin Spaniel.

The name refers to movie trailers, so as a visual pun, the cover of the album shows a toppled truck trailer.
The 'noise' at the end of the track "Get Out", when reversed, slowed down and the pitch altered, is a low quality demo version of the song "Intense Thing".  This track wasn't discovered until June 2006 by 2 fans experimenting around with running different effects through Ash songs.
An early rare version of this album was released with a bonus John Peel Sessions 7" with the tracks:
On 6 June 1995 Trailer was released in the United States.

[[Voyager program (Mars)]]

CATEGORIES: Missions to Mars, NASA programs, Cancelled spacecraft

The Voyager Mars Program  was a planned series of unmanned NASA probes to the planet Mars.  The missions were planned, as part of the Apollo Applications Program, between 1966 and 1968 and were scheduled for launch in 1974–75.  The probes were conceived as precursors for a manned Mars landing in the 1980s.
Originally NASA had proposed a direct lander using a variant of the Apollo Command Module launched atop of a Saturn IB rocket with a Centaur upper stage.  With the discovery by Mariner 4 in 1965 that Mars had only a tenuous atmosphere, the mission was changed to have both an orbiter and lander.  This required the use of a Saturn V to launch two probes at once. The orbiter would have been a modified Mariner probe identical to that employed for Mariner 8 and Mariner 9, while the landers would have been Surveyor moon probes modified with the use of aeroshells and a combination parachute/retrorocket landing systems.
Funding for the program, like that of the entire AAP, was cut in 1968 and the mission itself was cancelled entirely in 1971, mainly on the grounds that launching both probes on a single rocket was both risky and expensive.
Despite the cancellation, the planning and development of the Voyager Mars program was eventually carried out by NASA's Viking program in the mid-1970s. Cheaper and simpler than the Voyager Mars program (using the same Mariner 8/9 design for the orbiter, but with an automobile-sized lander with a very expensive microbiology lab), the Viking 1 and Viking 2 probes were launched to Mars on separate Titan IIIE/Centaur rockets in 1975 and reached Mars in 1976.
After the cancellation, the "Voyager" name was recycled for the Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 probes to the outer planets, with the latter probe, Voyager 2 (Mariner 12), completing another ambitious post-Apollo project, the "Grand Tour". The Saturn V had also been planned at one point as the launch vehicle for an upscaled probe for this mission.Cortright Oral History (p31)

Foo Fighters is the debut album by American alternative rock band Foo Fighters, released on July 4, 1995 by Capitol Records through Dave Grohl's label Roswell. Grohl wrote and recorded the entire album himself – with the exception of a guest guitar spot by Greg Dulli – with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington in 1994. Grohl claimed he recorded the album just for fun, describing it as a cathartic experience to recover from the death of his Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain.
After Grohl completed the recordings, he chose the name "Foo Fighters" for the project to hide his identity and passed cassettes copies of the sessions to personal friends. After said tapes attracted record label interest, Grohl signed with Capitol and recruited a full band to perform the songs live. The album was promoted through extensive tours and six singles, two of which received music videos. Foo Fighters earned positive reviews praising the songwriting and performances, and was also a commercial success, becoming the band's second-best-selling album in the United States and reaching the top five in the charts of United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

[[The Colour and the Shape]]

CATEGORIES: 1997 albums, Foo Fighters albums, Albums produced by Gil Norton, Capitol Records albums, Albums certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, English-language albums

The Colour and the Shape is the second studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. Produced by Gil Norton, it was released through Capitol Records and the group's own Roswell Records on May 20, 1997. The record is the debut of the Foo Fighters as a group, as the band's previous record, Foo Fighters (1995), was primarily recorded by frontman Dave Grohl and friend Barrett Jones as a demo. After the project ballooned and became an international success, the group convened for pre-production in the fall of 1996 and brought in producer Norton to establish a pop sensibility for the tracks. The band strived to create a full-fledged rock record, although the music press predicted another grunge offshoot.
Primarily inspired by Grohl's divorce from photographer Jennifer Youngblood in 1996, the lyricism on the record is substantially more introspective and the music more developed. The album's tracklisting was designed to resemble a therapy session, splitting the album between up-tempo tracks and ballads, reflecting conflicting emotions. Early sessions at Washington farm studio Bear Creek were poor and led the band to discard most of the recordings. The band regrouped without drummer William Goldsmith in early 1997 to record a second time at Hollywood's Grandmaster Recordings, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled that most of his material was re-recorded and left the band shortly thereafter.
Main singles "Monkey Wrench", "Everlong" and "My Hero" peaked within the top ten on United States rock radio, and the album charted at number three in the United Kingdom. Critics found the album a significant American rock release of the era, and it is now viewed as a seminal modern rock album. It was nominated for Grammy Award in 1998 for Best Rock Album. The Colour and the Shape is the Foo Fighters' biggest U.S. seller, having sold over two million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan.[tpl]cite web|last=Peters|first=Mitchell |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472359/foo-fighters-the-billboard-cover-story|title=Foo Fighters: The Billboard Cover Story|work=Billboard|date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl] The album was remastered and reissued in 2007 with several bonus tracks, celebrating its tenth anniversary.

[[Dead space (physiology)]]
CATEGORIES: Respiratory physiology, Respiratory therapy, Pulmonary function testing, Medical terminology, Underwater diving

In physiology, dead space is the volume of air which is inhaled that does not take part in the gas exchange, either because it (1) remains in the conducting airways, or (2) reaches alveoli that are not perfused or poorly perfused. In other words, not all the air in each breath is available for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Mammals breathe in and out of their lungs, wasting that part of the inspiration which remains in the conducting airways where no gas exchange can occur.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccmtutorials.com/rs/mv/strategy/page16.htm |title=Wasted Ventilation |publisher=Ccmtutorials.com |accessdate=2013-11-27[/tpl]

In humans, about a third of every resting breath has no change in O2 and CO2 levels. In adults, it is usually in the range of 150 mL.
Dead space can be increased (and better envisioned) by breathing through a long tube, such as a snorkel. Even though one end of the snorkel is open to the air, when the wearer breathes in, they inhale a significant quantity of air that remained in the snorkel from the previous exhalation. Thus, a snorkel increases the person's dead space by adding even more "airway" that doesn't participate in gas exchange.

[[Aortic dissection]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases of the aorta, Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries, Deaths from aortic dissection, Causes of death, Medical emergencies, Vascular surgery

Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the inner wall of the aorta causes blood to flow between the layers of the wall of the aorta, forcing the layers apart. In most cases this is associated with severe characteristic chest or abdominal pain described as "tearing" in character, and often with other symptoms that result from decreased blood supply to other organs. Aortic dissection is a medical emergency and can quickly lead to death, even with optimal treatment, as a result of decreased blood supply to other organs, cardiac failure, and sometimes rupture of the aorta. Aortic dissection is more common in those with a history of high blood pressure, a known thoracic aortic aneurysm, and in a number of conditions that affect blood vessel wall integrity such as Marfan syndrome and the vascular subtype of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. The diagnosis is made with medical imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or echocardiography).
The treatment of aortic dissection depends on the part of the aorta involved. Surgery is usually required for dissections that involve the aortic arch, while dissections of the part further away from the heart may be treated with blood pressure lowering only. Since the 1990s endovascular aneurysm repair (carried out from inside the blood vessels) has been used in specific cases.
Aortic dissection is relatively rare, occurring at an estimated rate of 2–3.5 per 100,000 people every year. It is more common in males for unknown reasons. Mean age at diagnosis is 63, although all age groups may be affected. Many cases of aortic dissection (40%) lead to death so rapidly that the person does not reach a hospital in time. The first case of aortic dissection described was in the post-mortem examination of King George II of Great Britain in 1760. Surgery for aortic dissection was introduced in the 1950s.

Hitzig v. Canada is a 2003 civil case in which challenged the constitutionality of the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (MMAR), now the Medical Marihuana Access Division. MMAR provided for exemptions from the law for approved medicinal users while allowing for no legal source of therapeutic cannabis products. The case was brought by Warren Hitzig, along with seven medical marijuana users (Alison Myrden, Stephen J Vandekemp, Marco Renda, Marylynne Chamney, Catherine Devries, Jari Dvorak and Debbie Stultz-Giffen).
Warren Saul Hitzig co-founded the Toronto Compassion Centre (originally the 'Medical Marijuana Resource Centre') in 1997 to provide high quality cannabis products to those with a documented medicinal need and to act as a medical marijuana information resource for the Canadian general public. The Centre's formation was announced in early 1998 with a press conference and letter to the Canadian government requesting authorization for their activities. 
The Hitzig applicants argued that the MMAR provided an illusory access to cannabis medicine, and effectively encouraged sick Canadians to look to the black market for their legal medication, and/or the seeds/plants needed to 'grow their own.' Ontario Superior Court judge Sidney Lederman agreed that this situation violated the rights of the applicants as set out by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982). He gave the Canadian government six months from January 9, 2003 to remedy the situation, which prompted the controversial announcement on July 8 that Health Canada would begin distribution of marijuana grown under contract to Prairie Plant Systems in Flin Flon, Manitoba.

The sunbirds and spiderhunters make up a family, Nectariniidae, of very small passerine birds. There are 132 species in 15 genera.  The family is distributed throughout Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and just reaches northern Australia. Most sunbirds feed largely on nectar, but also take insects and spiders, especially when feeding young. Flower tubes that bar access to nectar because of their shape, are simply punctured at the base near the nectaries. Fruit is also part of the diet of some species. Their flight is fast and direct on their short wings. 
The sunbirds have counterparts in two very distantly related groups: the hummingbirds of the Americas and the honeyeaters of Australia. The resemblances are due to convergent evolution brought about by a similar nectar-feeding lifestyle.[tpl]cite journal|title=Energy metabolism, respiratory quotient and breathing parameters in two convergent small bird species : the fork-tailed sunbird Aethopyga christinae (Nectariniidae) and the chilean hummingbird Sephanoides sephanoides (Trochilidae)|journal=Journal of thermal biology |year=1992|first= R.|last=Prinzinger|coauthors=Schafer T. & Schuchmann K.

The United States federal executive departments are among the oldest primary units of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States—the Departments of State, War, and the Treasury all having been established within a few weeks of each other in 1789. 
Federal executive departments are analogous to ministries common in parliamentary or semi-presidential systems but, with the United States being a presidential system, their heads otherwise equivalent to ministers, do not form a government (in a parliamentary sense) nor are they led by a head of government separate from the head of state. The heads of the federal executive departments, known as secretaries of their respective department, form the traditional Cabinet of the United States, an executive organ that serves at the disposal of the president and normally act as an advisory body to the presidency.
Since 1792, by statutory specification, the cabinet constituted a line of succession, after the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate to the presidency in the event of a vacancy in both that office and the vice presidency. The Constitution refers to these officials when it authorizes the President, in Article II, section 2, to "require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices."  In brief, they and their organizations are the administrative arms of the President.

Pottsylvania is a fictional country that appeared in the television series Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show, collectively referred to as Rocky and Bullwinkle.

It was noted for being a nation dedicated to all matters related to espionage and deceitfulness; children were taught in schools how to commit crimes, for instance, while casual conversations would have double meanings.
Populated entirely by government agents and saboteurs, Pottsylvania is the one nation where the cold war never thawed. Its highest honor was the Double Cross, and its newspaper, The Pottsylvania Eavesdropper, was printed in invisible ink. While many considered Pottsylvania to be a spoof, it was considered offensive by the government of the Soviet Union, which banned Rocky & Bullwinkle as anti-Soviet propaganda.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E1D91F31F933A05757C0A9669C8B63 Lidz, Frank:" SUMMER FILMS: CREATURE FEATURES; The Ongoing Adventures of Moose and Squirrel", New York Times, April 30, 2000
Pottsylvania's industries, besides espionage, included production of a vehicle called the "Assassin-8". Millions were built despite Pottsylvania having only 12 miles of road.
Natural landmarks included "Whynchatakea Peak", a large mountain. The geography of Pottsylvania is indeterminate, however. In some locations it appears to be a peninsula, while in others it appears to be either a coastal nation (with seaports) or completely landlocked. Nevertheless, it is accessible by submarine, which appears to be the main form of entry.
Flora and fauna in Pottsylvania included the man-eating Venus flytrap-like plant known as the "Pottsylvania Creeper," and one of the world's few supplies of mooseberry bushes—mooseberries being an ingredient used (in Rocky and Bullwinkle's world) for the production of rocket fuel.
The government of Pottsylvania had been headed by a uniformed dictator known only as Fearless Leader. (In some episodes, another important government figure is Mr. Big.) Boris Badenov[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20050211150953/http://www.erie.gov/sheriff/most_wanted/boris.asp |url=http://www.erie.gov/sheriff/most_wanted/boris.asp |title=Most Wanted: Boris Bandanov |publisher= |archivedate=2005-02-11 |accessdate=2014-04-16[/tpl] and Natasha Fatale seemed to be Fearless Leader's most frequently used secret agents, often sent to execute the country's schemes for gaining global power.

The Primacy of Ireland was historically disputed between the Archbishop of Armagh and the Archbishop of Dublin until finally settled by Pope Innocent VI.  Primate is a title of honour denoting ceremonial precedence in the Church, and in the Middle Ages there was an intense rivalry between the two archbishoprics as to seniority. Since 1353 the Archbishop of Armagh has been titled Primate of All Ireland and the Archbishop of Dublin Primate of Ireland, signifying that they are the senior churchmen in the island of Ireland, the Primate of All Ireland being the more senior. The titles are used by both the Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland bishops.  The distinction mirrors that in the Church of England between the Primate of All England, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Primate of England, the Archbishop of York.MacGeoghegan, James, The history of Ireland, ancient and modern (1844), James Duffy, Dublin, p. 337

Ormsby County, Nevada was a county of Nevada from 1861 until 1969. It contained Carson City, the county seat, and later, the state capital, founded two years earlier. It was named after Major William M. Ormsby, one of the original settlers of Carson City, killed along with seventy-five other white men in 1860, in an unsuccessful attempt to subdue a perceived uprising of Paiute Indians near Pyramid Lake, Nevada, which was at the time part of Utah Territory.
In 1969, the county was dissolved, and the independent city of Carson City took over all municipal services.

The services and expertise offered by PMCs are typically similar to those of governmental military or police forces, most often on a smaller scale. While PMCs often provide services to train or supplement official armed forces in service of governments, they can also be employed by private companies to provide bodyguards for key staff or protection of company premises, especially in hostile territories. However, contractors who use offensive force in a war zone could be considered unlawful combatants, in reference to a concept outlined in the Shaan Tehal Conventions and explicitly specified by the 2006 American Military Commissions Act.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-blackwater15oct15,1,6804674,full.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage&ctrack=2&cset=true|title=America's own unlawful combatants?|first=Julian E..|last=Barnes|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-10-15[/tpl]
The services of private contractors are used around the world. P. W. Singer author of Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry says "In geographic terms, it operates in over 50 different countries. It’s operated in every single continent but Antarctica."  In the 1990s there used to be 50 military personnel for every 1 contractor, now the ratio is 10 to 1 (Singer).  Singer points out that these contractors have a number of duties depending on who they are hired by. In developing countries that have natural resources, such as oil refineries in Iraq, they are hired to guard the area. They are also hired to guard companies that contract services and reconstruction efforts such as General Electric. Apart from securing companies, they also secure officials and government affiliates. Private military companies carry out many different missions and jobs. These include things such as supplying bodyguards to the Afghan president Hamid Karzai and piloting reconnaissance airplanes and helicopters as a part of Plan Colombia.

Sir Herbert Edward Read. Praeger, 1964. Page 235[/ref]
Nele was born in Berlin, the daughter of Marie-Louise (1908–1989) and Arnold Bode (1900–1977). She started her career in 1950 as a student of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. She participated in Documenta II, organised by her father in 1959. She joined the Situationist International, but was excluded in February 1962.
She learned to handle all sorts of metal and to weld steel for her artwork. After her return to Berlin she worked with the artist Hans Uhlmann during  her time at the “Berliner Akademie” and later on at the “Studio Lacourière” in Paris. Since the late 1960s, Nele has lived and worked in Frankfurt. Since the early 1990s she has been teaching at the Universities of Frankfurt and Giessen.
Her best-known sculpture is named Die Rampe, a Holocaust memorial dated from 1980.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hJpUAAAAMAAJ&q=Die+Rampe+sculpture&dq=Die+Rampe+sculpture&hl=en&ei=PeaGTPGOK4WglAeS_sGUDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg |title=Contemporary Artists: A-K |author=St. Sara Pendergast, Tom Pendergast|publisher= St. James Press |year= 2002[/tpl] Her latest metal sculpture at large scale is now located at the Dalbergplatz in Frankfurt-Höchst and named Windsbraut.

Golden World Records was a record label owned by Ed Wingate and Joanne Bratton (née Jackson, widow of boxing champion Johnny Bratton). The recording studio was located in Detroit, MI., first on 11801 12th Street (Rosa Parks), and then on 3246 West Davison, within the area of the present-day Davison Freeway. A business office on some of the labels reads 4039 Buena Vista. 
Besides the following discography, the studio's national hits included "Oh How Happy" by Livonia, Michigan's Shades of Blue and "Cool Jerk" by the Capitols. The early, pre-Motown songs by Edwin Starr (War! What is it Good For?) such as "Agent Double-O-Soul" were recorded in the Golden World studio.
Golden World operated from 1962 to 1968. 
The label and its subsidiaries were purchased by Berry Gordy in 1966, and folded into Gordy's Motown Record Corporation. The Golden World studio became Motown's "Studio B", working in support of the original Motown recording studio (Studio A) at Hitsville USA.  Before its purchase by Gordy, the studio's recordings often included moonlighting Motown back-up musicians, including James Jamerson on bass and George McGregor, who was the studio percussionist.
The famous clock that hung in Golden World Records is currently owned by Melodies and Memories in Eastpointe, Michigan and is on display there.

[[Metro station]]

CATEGORIES: Railway stations, Rapid transit

A metro station or subway station is a railway station for a rapid transit system, often known by names such as "metro", "underground" and "subway".  Such a station can be elevated, underground, or about ground level depending on the level of the train tracks.  At crossings of metro lines, they are multi-level.  There are entrances/exits at ground/street level, often with stairs or sometimes ramps or escalators leading to any elevated or lowered track level area.  
At street level the logo of the metro company marks the entrance of the station, along with the schematics of the services at the station.  Some metro operators also post the station name at the station entrance.  Often there are several entrances for one station, saving one from having to cross the street. In such a case, tunnels or overhead stations can often also be used just to cross the street.  
In some cases metro stations are connected to important buildings by a direct enclosed hallway (see underground city).
Some metro systems, such as those of Naples, Stockholm, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tashkent, Kiev,[tpl]cite web |url=http://mic-ro.com/metro/metroart.html|title=Metro Arts and Architecture |publisher=Metro Bits|accessdate=2006-12-04[/tpl] Montreal, Kaohsiung and Prague are famous for the beautiful architecture and public art. The Paris Métro is famous for its art nouveau station entrances; while the Athens Metro is known for its display of archeological relics found during construction.
Metro stations, more so than railway and bus stations, often have a characteristic artistic design that can identify each stop. Some have sculptures or frescoes. For example, London's Baker Street station is adorned with tiles depicting Sherlock Holmes. The tunnel for Paris' Concorde station is decorated with tiles spelling the Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen. Every metro station in Valencia, Spain has a different sculpture on the ticket-hall level. Alameda station is decorated with fragments of white tile, like the dominant style of the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències. On the Tyne and Wear Metro, the station at Newcastle United's home ground St James' Park is decorated in the clubs famous black and white stripes.  Each station of the Red Line and Purple Line subway in Los Angeles was built with different artwork and decorating schemes, such as murals, tile artwork and sculptural benches. Every station of the Mexico City Metro is prominently identified by a unique icon in addition to its name, because most of its users were illiterate at the time the system was designed. 
However, it is not always the case that metro operators strive to make all stations artistically unique.  Sir Norman Foster's new system in Bilbao, Spain uses the same modern architecture at every station to make navigation easier for the passenger, though some may argue that this is at the expense of character.
In some stations, especially where trains are fully automated, the entire platform is screened from the track by a wall, typically of glass, with automatic platform-edge doors (PEDs). These open, like elevator doors, only when a train is stopped, and thus eliminate the hazard that a passenger will accidentally fall (or deliberately jump) onto the tracks and be run over or electrocuted.
Control over ventilation of the platform is also improved, allowing it to be heated or cooled without having to do the same for the tunnels. The doors add cost and complexity to the system, and trains may have to approach the station more slowly so they can stop in accurate alignment with them.
The largest and most complex metro station in the world is the Paris Métro-RER station Châtelet-Les Halles in France.http://www.ratp.fr/common/ressources/concertation_p1.pdf
The metro station with the highest elevation above-ground in the world is New York City's Smith–Ninth Streets station of the New York City Subway in the United States.http://www.mta.info/news/stories/?story=177

[[National Security Council]]

CATEGORIES: National security councils

A National Security Council (NSC) is usually an executive branch governmental body responsible for coordinating policy on national security issues and advising chief executives on matters related to national security. An NSC is often headed by a national security advisor and staffed with senior-level officials from military, diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement and other governmental bodies. The functions and responsibilities of an NSC at the strategic state level are different from those of the United Nations Security Council, which is more of a diplomatic forum.
Occasionally a nation will be ruled by a similarly named body, such as "the National Security Committee" or "Council for National Security". These bodies are often a result of the establishment or preservation of a military dictatorship (or some other national crisis), do not always have  statutory approval, and are usually intended to have transitory or provisional powers. See also: coup d'état.
Some nations may have a similar body which is not formally part of the executive government. For example, the Central National Security Commission in China is an organ of the Communist Party of China, the sole ruling party, rather than an organ of the executive government.

CATEGORIES: BDSM equipment, Bondage positions

A crotch rope  (also known as Matanawa or SakuraShibari You Can Use, Lee Harrington, ISBN 978-0-615-14490-0: Pages 125-145 in Japanese bondage) is a bondage technique which involves the tying of rope around a woman's waist which is then passed between the labia to apply painful or pleasurable pressure to the female genitals. Crotch rope most commonly uses rope, but webbing, straps or a harness may also be used.
A crotch rope may be tied over clothing or directly onto the skin, and can be worn under clothing or in full view. While crotch ropes are most commonly intended for women, specific variations exist for males.
A crotch rope can also be used as an unsophisticated type of chastity belt.

Due to its strength[tpl]what|date=March 2014[/tpl] and former[tpl]when|date=March 2014[/tpl] size[tpl]what|date=March 2014[/tpl], the Bundesbank is the most influential[tpl]what|date=March 2014[/tpl] member of the ESCB. Both the Deutsche Bundesbank and the European Central Bank (ECB) are located in Frankfurt, Germany. It is sometimes referred to as "Buba" for Bundesbank.commentary14
The Bundesbank was established in 1957 and succeeded the Bank deutscher Länder, which introduced the Deutsche Mark on 20 June 1948. Until the euro was physically introduced in 2002, the Deutsche Bundesbank was the central bank of the former Deutsche Mark ("German Mark", sometimes known in English as the "Deutschmark").
The Deutsche Bundesbank was the first central bank to be given full[tpl]what|date=March 2014[/tpl] independence, leading this form of central bank to be referred to as the Bundesbank model, as opposed, for instance, to the New Zealand model, which has a goal (i.e. inflation target) set by the government.
The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. This made the German Mark one of the most respected currencies, and the Bundesbank gained substantial indirect influence in many European countries.

The term was originally coined in 1906 when the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung noticed that the reddest stars—classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme—could be divided into two distinct groups. They are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter. To distinguish these groups, he called them "giant" and "dwarf" stars.  The dwarf stars being fainter and the giants being brighter than the sun.  The scope of the term "dwarf" was later expanded to include the following:

[[Scottish Parliament general election, 2003]]

CATEGORIES: General elections to the Scottish Parliament, 2003 elections in the United Kingdom, 2003 in Scotland

The Scottish Parliament election, 2003, was the second general election of the Scottish Parliament. It was held on 1 May 2003 and it brought no change in terms of control of the Scottish Executive. Jack McConnell, the Labour Party Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), remained in office as First Minister and the Executive continued as a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition.
The results also showed rises in support for "minor parties" including the Scottish Green Party and the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and declines in support for the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party (SNP). The Conservative and Unionist Party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats each polled almost exactly the same percentage of the vote as they had in the 1999 election, with each holding the same number of seats as before.
Three independent MSPs were elected: Dennis Canavan, Margo MacDonald and Jean Turner.  John Swinburne, leader of the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party, was also elected. This led to talk of a "rainbow" Parliament, but the arithmetic meant that the coalition of Labour and Scottish Liberal Democrats could continue in office, which they did until the 2007 election.
The decline in support for the SNP was viewed by some as a rejection of the case for Scottish independence. Others argued against this, pointing out that the number of MSPs in favour of independence actually rose because most of the minor parties such as the SSP share this position with the SNP.

On April 1, 1970, they moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and changed their name to the Brewers.
The team's name originated from the owner's part-time job as a harbor pilot and the city's association with the airplane industry."Seattle Post-Intelligencer," 10 March 1968 and Bill Mullins, Becoming Big League, p. 105  The team colors were red, navy blue, and gold. Seattle had long been a hotbed for minor league baseball and was home to the Seattle Rainiers, a successful team in the Pacific Coast League (PCL). At the time, Seattle was the third-biggest metropolitan area on the West Coast. The Cleveland Indians briefly considered a move to Seattle in 1964 but opted to stay in Ohio.  In 1967 Charles Finley looked to move his Kansas City Athletics to Seattle, but ended up moving the Athletics to Oakland, California.  There was no real competition from other professional teams. While Seattle had landed the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s SuperSonics in 1967, the NBA was not in the same class as baseball was in terms of popularity at the time.

CATEGORIES: Film techniques, Intertextuality, Literary concepts, Narrative forms

Homage ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|m|ɨ|dʒ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|m|ɨ|dʒ[/tpl]) is a show or demonstration of respect or dedication to someone or something, sometimes by simple declaration but often by some more oblique reference, artistic or poetic.
It was originally a declaration of fealty in the feudal system (see Homage (medieval))—swearing that one was the man (French: homme) of the feudal lord.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qtgotOF0MKQC&pg=PA686 |title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages |volume=2 |chapter=Homage[/tpl]  The concept then became used figuratively for an acknowledgement of quality or superiority.  For example, a man might give homage to a lady, so honouring her beauty and other graces.  In German scholarship, followers of a great scholar developed the custom of honouring their mentor by producing papers for a festschrift dedicated to him.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ESFS7XXhujAC&pg=PA75 |title=An author's guide to scholarly publishing |author=Robin M. Derricourt[/tpl]
The concept now often appears in the arts where one author shows respect to a topic by calling it a homage, such as Homage to Catalonia.  Alternatively, creative artists may show respect to a veteran of the field or to an admired practitioner by alluding to their work.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H4q8ZosSvB8C&pg=PA88 |title=The limits of interpretation |author=Umberto Eco[/tpl]  In rock music this can take the form of a tribute album or of a sample.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0tz5YpijuksC&pg=PA616 |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World |author=John Shepherd |chapter=Rock Homage[/tpl]  [tpl]As of | 2010[/tpl], the digital techniques used to generate many forms of media make it easy to borrow from other works and this remediation may be used in homage to them.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&pg=PA497 |title=Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory |author=Richard Grusin[/tpl]

[[Friedrich August von Alberti]]
CATEGORIES: 1795 births, 1878 deaths, German geologists, People from Sulz am Neckar

Friedrich August von Alberti (September 4, 1795 – September 12, 1878) was a German geologist whose ground-breaking 1834 publicationMonographie des Bunten Sandsteins, Muschelkalks und Keupers, und die Verbindung dieser Gebilde zu einer Formation (Stuttgart-Tübingen: Cotta), 1834 recognized the unity of the three characteristic strata that compose the sedimentary deposits of the Triassic period in Northern Europe. From the fossils contained in the three distinct layers— of red bed sandstones, capped by chalk (Muschelkalk), followed by black shales— that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe, and are called the 'Trias' (Latin trias meaning triad), Alberti detected that they formed a single stratigraphic formation; today it would be termed a system.  He identified the Triassic as bearing a unique fossil fauna, bounded by the Permian extinction below and by another extinction above.
Alberti grew up in Stuttgart and Rottweil where he was educated at the Gymnasium and went to the military school in Stuttgart. Afterwards he went back to Rottweil, a town [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south of Stuttgart. He learned the salt processing system and became a Salinentechniker (salt technician). He was quickly promoted to Salineninspektor (salt supervisor). In 1823, based on his perception of the area's geology, he had an idea to drill for salt in Rottenmünster. Eight months later the team had success and found salt, in a location where no one would have considered the possibility of finding salt.
He also made excavations in the Roman ruins of Rottweil, the ancient Arae Flaviae; he published his findings from 1833 to 1837.
Alberti bought a house and lived in Rottenmünster, a former abbey 2 miles from Rottweil, from 1829 to 1853. While there he worked as manager for two salt companies. After he retired he moved to Heilbronn. He took a position as advisor, salt technician, and geologist. He had excellent skills in understanding sandstone and limestone. He discovered that if you find combinations of these two kinds of stone together, you will always find salt. He wrote books on his experiences of looking and drilling for salt.F. A. von Alberti, Halurgische Geologie, 1852
He invented the method of mining salt by pumping water into the mine; when the brine rose to the surface, he would allow the water to evaporate and then he would collect the salt.
The Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen gave Friedrich August von Alberti an honorary doctorate for his achievements in the salt-mining industry. The city honored him with a street in his name.
Alberti was very well thought of and popular. People liked him for his personality, his happiness, and the fact that he was very open and honest to everyone. After he died his family stayed in Rottweil, where also a street bears his name. Today many of his descendants still live in the town.
In Bad Friedrichshall, also a former salt town, a school is named after him, the Friedrich-von-Alberti-Gymnasium.

The word "synvovia" or "sinovia" was coined by Paracelsus,The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language and may have been derived from the Greek word "syn" ("with") and the Latin word "ovum" ("egg") because the synovial fluid in joints that have a cavity between the bearing surfaces is similar to egg white.

Core War is a programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called "warriors") compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language called Redcode.
At the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory at a random location, after which each program executes one instruction in turn. The object of the game is to cause the processes of opposing programs to terminate (which happens if they execute an invalid instruction), leaving the victorious program in sole possession of the machine.

A cove is a small type of bay or coastal inlet. Coves usually have narrow, restricted entrances, are often circular or oval, and are often situated within a larger bay. Small, narrow, sheltered bays, inlets, creeks, or recesses in a coast are often considered coves. Colloquially, the term can be used to describe a sheltered bay.
Geomorphology describes coves as precipitously walled and rounded cirque-like openings as in a valley extending into or down a mountainside, or in a hollow or nook of a cliff or steep mountainside.
Coves are formed by differential erosion. Differential erosion occurs when softer rocks are worn away faster than the harder rocks surrounding them. These rocks further erode to form a circular bay with a narrow entrance called a cove.
An example of a cove is Lulworth Cove on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, England. West of it a second cove, Stair Hole, is forming.

Hans Marsilius Purrmann (April 10, 1880 – April 17, 1966) was a German artist. He was born in Speyer where he also grew up. He completed an apprenticeship as a scene painter and interior decorator, and subsequently studied in Karlsruhe and Munich before going to Paris in 1906. It was here he became a student and later a friend of Henri Matisse whom he set  up a painting school with.  After 1916 Purrmann lived in Berlin and Langenargen (Lake Constance), moving from there in 1935 to run the German art foundation at the Villa Romana in Florence. He lived there until 1943, then in Montagnola (Switzerland). He died in Basel. Typical of Purrmann's style are colourful, sensitively painted landscapes, still lifes and portraits. There are large collections of his works in Langenargen Museum and in the Purrmann House, Speyer.

[[HTML element]]

CATEGORIES: HTML

An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document or "web page", once this has been parsed into the Document Object Model. HTML is composed of a tree of HTML elements and other nodes, such as text nodes. Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text. HTML elements represent semantics, or meaning. For example, the title element represents the title of the document.
In the HTML syntax, most elements are written with a start tag and an end tag, with the content in between. An HTML tag is composed of the name of the element, surrounded by angle brackets. An end tag also has a slash after the opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the start tag. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the p element, would be written as

 In the HTML syntax, most elements are written ... 

However, not all of these elements require the end tag, or even the start tag, to be present.  Some elements, the so-called void elements, do not have an end tag. A typical example is the br element, which represents a significant line break, such as in a poem or an address. A void element's behaviour is predefined, and it can not contain any content or other elements. For example, the address of the dentist in the movie Finding Nemo would be written as

 P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney 

When using an XHTML DTD, it is required to open and close the element with a single tag. To specify that it is a void element, a "/" is included at the end of the tag (not to be confused with the "/" at the beginning of a closing tag).

 P. Sherman
42 Wallaby Way
Sydney 

HTML attributes are specified inside the start tag. For example, the abbr element, which represents an abbreviation, expects a title attribute within its opening tag. This would be written as

abbr.

The Royal Mint is the body permitted to manufacture, or mint, the coins of the United Kingdom. The Mint originated over 1,100 years ago, producing coins for England and eventually Great Britain. Since 2010 it has operated as Royal Mint Ltd, a company owned by HM Treasury, under an exclusive contract to supply all coinage for the UK. Royal Mint Ltd is 100% owned by HM Treasury, though the latter delegates shareholder responsibilities to the Shareholder Executive.
As well as minting coins for the UK, the Royal Mint also mints and exports coins to many other countries and produces military medals, commemorative medals, and other such items for governments, schools and businesses, being known as the world's leading exporting Mint. Responsibility for the security of the site falls to the Ministry of Defence Police, who provide an armed contingent.
In 1968 the Royal Mint began to move its operations from Tower Hill in the City of London to Llantrisant, Mid Glamorgan, Wales, and has operated on a single site in Llantrisant since 1980.
At Llantrisant it holds an extensive collection of coins dating from the 16th century onwards, housed in eighty cabinets made by Elizabeth II's cabinet maker, Hugh Swann. The site occupies [tpl]convert|38|acre[/tpl] and employs 765 people.[tpl]cite web|title=www.royalmint.com|url=http://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/ourlocation|accessdate=2012-03-27|publisher=Royal Mint|date=2012-03-27|work=Royal Mint website[/tpl]

[[X11 color names]]
CATEGORIES: Color, X Window System, Cascading Style Sheets

In computing, on the X Window System, X11 color names are represented in a simple text file, which maps certain strings to RGB color values. It is shipped with every X11 installation, hence the name, and is usually located in <X11root>/lib/X11/rgb.txt. The web colors list is descended from it.
The list does not show continuity either in selected color values or in color names, and many color triplets have multiple names. Despite this, graphic designers and others got used to them, making it practically impossible to introduce a different list. In some applications multipart names are written with spaces, in others joined together, often in camel case; this article uses spaces and uppercase initials.
Color names are not standardized by Xlib or the X11 protocol.  In earlier releases of X11 (prior to the introduction of Xcms), server implementors were encouraged to modify the RGB values in the reference color database to account for gamma correction.[tpl]cite book|last=Nye|first=Adrian|title=Xlib programming manual : for version 11 of the X Window System|year=1990|publisher=O'Reilly & Associates|location=CA|isbn=0-937175-11-0|edition=2nd ed. covers release 3 and release 4, major revisions.[/tpl]

Approximately the full list as is available today shipped with X11R4 on 29 January 1989, with substantial additions by Paul Ravelling (who added colors based on Sinclair Paints samples), John C. Thomas (who added colors based on a set of 72 Crayola crayons he had to hand) and Jim Fulton (who reconciled contributions to produce the X11R4 list). The project was running DEC VT240 terminals at the time, so would have worked to that device.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Mar/0272.html|first=Alex|last=Sexton|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=12 March 2014|title=Last call comments on CSS3 module: color|work=www-style@w3.org mailing list|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium[/tpl]

Happy hardcore, also known as happycore,Bianca Casady of CocoRosie defines happycore in an interview at 4:50 as being a sentimental and cartoonish form of technomusic. (March 2010) is a genre of music typified by a very fast tempo (usually around 160–180 BPM), often coupled with solo vocals and sentimental lyrics. Its characteristically 4/4 beat "happy" sound distinguishes it from most other forms of hardcore techno, which tend to be "darker"."Business as usual for critic-proof Boys Pop Reviews ; Deck goes here" – Toronto Star It is typically in a major mode, like Ionian or Lydian. In its original incarnation, it was often characterized by piano riffs, synthetic stabs and spacey effects. This genre of music is closely related to the typically Dutch genre of gabber. Happy hardcore evolved from breakbeat hardcore around 1991–1993, as the original house music-based rave became faster and began to include breakbeats, evolving into oldschool jungle which evolved into drum and bass. Some of the most famous artists of this genre include DJ Brisk, Scott Brown, Darren Styles, Hixxy, DJ Paul Elstak, Dune, Scooter, Stu Allan (aka VISA), Dougal, and DJ Gammer.

The Revised Standard Version (RSV) is an English translation of the Bible published in several parts during the mid-20th century.

The RSV posed the first serious challenge to the popularity of the King James Version (KJV). It was intended to be a readable and literally accurate modern English translation. The intention was not only to create a clearer version of the Bible for the English-speaking church but also to "preserve all that is best in the English Bible as it has been known and used through the centuries" and "to put the message of the Bible in simple, enduring words that are worthy to stand in the great Tyndale-King James tradition."
The RSV was published in the following stages:
In later years, the RSV served as the basis for two revisions - the New Revised Standard Version of 1989, and the English Standard Version of 2001.

The Cleveland Barons were a professional hockey team in the American Hockey League. They played in Cleveland, Ohio, USA at the Gund Arena between 2001 and 2006. 
The team was named in honor of the popular Barons team that played in the AHL and its forerunners from 1929 to 1973. The Barons name was revived in 2001 when the San Jose Sharks purchased their AHL affiliate, the Kentucky Thoroughblades, and relocated them to Cleveland, where they would play at the arena which was owned and operated by Sharks owners George and Gordon Gund.  The Gunds had also owned the most recent incarnation of the Barons, who played in the NHL in the late 1970s (the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978, and the Sharks spun off from the North Stars in 1991).
The franchise relocated to Worcester, Massachusetts for the 2006–07 season and became the Worcester Sharks.  Dan Gilbert, the owner of the NBA Cleveland Cavaliers, purchased the inactive Utah Grizzlies AHL franchise and moved it to Cleveland. Renamed the Lake Erie Monsters, the club began play in Cleveland in 2007.

The St. Louis Eagles were a professional ice hockey team and a former member of the National Hockey League (NHL) based in St. Louis, Missouri. The Eagles existed for only one year, playing in the 1934–35 NHL season.
The team was originally founded in 1883 as the Ottawa Senators, a successful independent team that joined the NHL as a charter member in 1917.  From the mid-1920s onward, they endured financial strain caused in part by being in the NHL's smallest market. The financial problems forced the Senators to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season. Upon their return to play – and having sold their better players in an effort to raise funds – the Senators finished in last place for two straight seasons and continued to lose money. Following the repeat last place finish, the team decided it could not survive in Ottawa and hoped to move to a bigger market.
In an attempt to recoup losses and pay outstanding debts, the Senators moved the NHL franchise to St. Louis, where it was nicknamed the Eagles.  However, the team continued to bleed money due to travel expenses, and it was forced to make ends meet by selling players to other teams. After the season, the owners asked the NHL for a second time for permission to suspend operations. This time, the NHL refused the request.  Instead, the league bought back the franchise, halted its operations and dispersed its players among the remaining teams.

The Hamilton Tigers were a professional ice hockey team, and a member of the National Hockey League (NHL), based in Hamilton, Ontario, that played from 1920–1925. The Tigers were formed from the sale of the Quebec Bulldogs NHL franchise to Hamilton interests.  After years of struggling, the franchise finished first in the league in the 1924-25 NHL season.  However, a players' strike after the season resulted in the franchise's dissolution.  The players' contracts were sold to New York City interests to stock the expansion New York Americans. A name-sake amateur team existed prior, and during, the NHL team's existence and a minor league professional team named the Hamilton Tigers existed from 1926 until 1930.

[[Fyrd]]

CATEGORIES: Warfare of the Middle Ages

The fyrd, in early Anglo-Saxon times, was an army that was mobilized from freemen to defend their shire, or from select representatives to join a royal expedition. Service in the fyrd was usually of short duration and participants were expected to provide their own arms and provisions. The composition of the fyrd evolved over the years, particularly as a reaction to raids and invasions by the Vikings. The system of defence and conscription was reorganised during the reign of Alfred the Great, who set up  33 fortified towns (or burhs) in his kingdom of Wessex. The amount of taxation required to maintain each town was laid down in a document known as the Burghal Hidage. Each lord had his individual holding of land assessed in hides. Based on his land holding, he had to contribute men and arms to maintain and defend the burhs. Non compliance of this requirement could lead to severe penalties.
Ultimately the fyrd consisted of a nucleus of experienced soldiers that would be supplemented by ordinary villagers and farmers from the shires who would accompany their lords.

[[Canadian federal election, 1997]]
CATEGORIES: Canadian federal election, 1997

The Canadian federal election of 1997 was held on June 2, 1997, to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 36th Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's Liberal Party of Canada won a second majority government. The Reform Party of Canada replaced the Bloc Québécois as the Official Opposition.
The election closely reflected the pattern that had been set out in the 1993 election. The Liberals swept Ontario, a divided Bloc managed a reduced majority in Quebec, and much of the west was won by Reform, particularly its Alberta base, enabling the Reform to overtake the Bloc as the second largest party.
The major change was that the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada all but wiped out the Liberals in Atlantic Canada, leaving only Prince Edward Island which remained entirely Liberal. Among these defeated were two cabinet ministers; David Dingwall, Minister of Public Works from Nova Scotia, and Doug Young, Minister of National Defence from New Brunswick, both lost to NDP candidates in a major blow to the Liberals, as Atlantic voters were upset over cuts to employment insurance and other programs. Also unsuccessful in his bid for a seat was Dominic LeBlanc, a Liberal and the son of then-Governor General Roméo LeBlanc.
Some commentators on election night were even predicting that the Liberals would be cut down to a minority government, and/or Chrétien would lose his seat, although it was clear that none of the opposition parties could manage a plurality of seats. Chrétien did narrowly win his riding and the Liberals would manage a four-seat majority thanks to some gains in Quebec at the expense of the Bloc, although they finished considerably lower than the 1993 total due to the losses in Atlantic Canada. Mostly because of these gains in Atlantic Canada, Jean Charest's Tories and Alexa McDonough's NDP both regained official party status in the House of Commons. This marked the first time in Canadian history that five political parties held official party status in a single session of Parliament. The Progressive Conservative Party placed third in the popular vote, behind Liberal and Reform, but still won the fewest seats due to the first past the post system. The Reform Party gained seats in Western Canada to overtake the Bloc as the second-largest party in the House to become the Official Opposition.
Independent member John Nunziata, who had been expelled from the Liberal Party for opposing the Goods and Services Tax, was also re-elected in his riding in Toronto.
A change of 718 votes in just five ridings, Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, Simcoe—Grey, Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Cardigan, and Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet (286, 241, 117, 50, and 24 votes respectively), from the Liberals to the second place candidate (NDP, Ref, PC, PC, and BQ, respectively) would have resulted in a minority government.
Voter turnout was 67.0%, the ninth lowest voter turnout in Canadian history.[tpl]cite web|last=Pomfret|first=R.|title=Voter Turnout at Federal Elections and Referendums|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=ele&dir=turn&document=index&lang=e|work=Elections Canada online|publisher=Elections Canada|accessdate=10 March 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Prionopidae, Shrikes

The Prionopidae are a family uniting some smallish to mid-sized songbird species. One group, the helmetshrikes, were included with the true shrikes in the family Laniidae, later on split between several presumably closely related groups such as bushshrikes (Malaconotidae) and cuckoo-shrikes (Campephagidae), but are now considered sufficiently distinctive to be separated from that group as the family Prionopidae. The Prionopidae and the two former are part of a group which is generally rather homogenous but also includes the diverse vangas. The Campephagidae are a bit more distinct.
Also included here are the philentomas were traditionally placed with the Muscicapidae (flycatchers) when these were still used as a "wastebin taxon", largely as an expedient because these enigmatic birds have long defied ornithologists as regards their systematic placement; they remain little-studied and their placement here is just as provisional as it was in the Muscicapidae but even if they do not really belong here, they are at least not very distant to the Prionopidae.

[[Consistency model]]

CATEGORIES: Consistency models, Transaction processing

In computer science, consistency models are used in distributed systems like distributed shared memory systems or distributed data stores (such as a filesystems, databases, optimistic replication systems or Web caching). The system supports a given model if operations on memory follow specific rules. The data consistency model specifies a contract between programmer and system, wherein the system guarantees that if the programmer follows the rules, memory will be consistent and the results of memory operations will be predictable.
High level languages, such as C, C++, and Java, partially maintain the contract by translating memory operations into low-level operations in a way that preserves memory semantics. To hold to the contract, compilers may reorder some memory instructions, and library calls such as pthread_mutex_lock() encapsulate required synchronization.
Verifying sequential consistency is undecidable in general, even for finite-state cache-coherence protocols.
Consistency models define rules for the apparent order and visibility of updates, and it is a continuum with tradeoffs.

[[Franco-Flemish School]]

CATEGORIES: Composition schools, Renaissance music, Dutch Renaissance, Walloon culture

In music, the Franco-Flemish School or more precisely the Netherlandish School refers, somewhat imprecisely, to the style of polyphonic vocal music composition in the Burgundian States (Burgundy, Picardy, Burgundian Flanders, ...) in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and to the composers who wrote it.
The composers of this time and place, and the music they produced, are also known as the "Franco Flemish School", more precisely the Netherlandish School. 
Most of these musicians were born in Hainaut, Flanders, Brabant or Picardy. During periods of political stability, such as the Burgundian Low Countries, this was a center of cultural activity, although the exact centers shifted location during this time, and by the end of the sixteenth century the focal point of the Western musical world shifted from this region to Italy.
While many of the composers were born in the region loosely known as the "Low Countries", they were famous for working elsewhere. Flemings moved to Italy where they were called "I fiamminghi" or Oltremontani ("those from over the Alps"), to Spain - notably in the Flemish chapel (capilla flamenca) of the Habsburgs, to towns in Germany and France and other parts of Europe - Poland, Czechia, Austria, Hungary, England, Sweden, Denmark, Saxony - carrying their styles with them.  The diffusion of their technique, especially after the revolutionary development of printing, produced the first true international style since the unification of Gregorian chant in the 9th century.
Following the history of the Burgundian States are three groups, or generations, that are sometimes distinguished in the Franco-Flemish school.  Development of this musical style was continuous, and these generations only provide useful reference points.

[[Martingale (probability theory)]]

CATEGORIES: Stochastic processes, Martingale theory, Game theory

In probability theory, a martingale is a model of a fair game where knowledge of past events never helps predict the mean of the future winnings. In particular, a martingale is a sequence of random variables (i.e., a stochastic process) for which, at a particular time in the realized sequence, the expectation of the next value in the sequence is equal to the present observed value even given knowledge of all prior observed values at a current time.
To contrast, in a process that is not a martingale, it may still be the case that the expected value of the process at one time is equal to the expected value of the process at the next time. However, knowledge of the prior outcomes (e.g., all prior cards drawn from a card deck) may be able to reduce the uncertainty of future outcomes. Thus, the expected value of the next outcome given knowledge of the present and all prior outcomes may be higher than the current outcome if a winning strategy is used. Martingales exclude the possibility of winning strategies based on game history, and thus they are a model of fair games.

Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy (July 6, 1888 – February 24, 1973)[tpl]Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= [/tpl]  was a historian and social philosopher, whose work spanned the disciplines of history, theology, sociology, linguistics and beyond. Born in Berlin, Germany into a non-observant Jewish family, the son of a prosperous banker, he converted to Christianity in his late teens, and thereafter the interpretation and reinterpretation of Christianity was a consistent theme in his writings. He met and married Margrit Hüssy in 1914. In 1925, the couple legally combined their names.In Germany, their family name became "Rosenstock-Hüssy." In the United States, it was adapted to English spelling as "Rosenstock-Huessy." Published references in this article use the latter spelling. They had a son, Hans, in 1921.
Rosenstock-Huessy served as an officer in the German army during World War I. His experience caused him to reexamine the foundations of liberal Western culture. He then pursued an academic career in Germany as a specialist in medieval law, which was disrupted by the rise of Nazism. In 1933, after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, he emigrated to the United States where he began a new academic career, initially at Harvard University and then at Dartmouth College, where he taught from 1935 to 1957.
Although never part of the mainstream of intellectual discussion during his lifetime, his work drew the attention of W. H. Auden, Harold Berman, Martin Marty, Lewis Mumford, Page Smith, and others. Rosenstock-Huessy may be best known as the close friend of and correspondent with Franz Rosenzweig. Their exchange of letters is considered by scholars of religion and theology to be indispensable in the study of the modern encounter of Jews with Christianity. In his work, Rosenstock-Huessy discussed speech and language as the dominant shaper of human character and abilities in every social context. He is viewed as belonging to a group of thinkers who revived post-Nietzschean religious thought.[tpl]Harvnb|Cristaudo|2008|p= [/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Christian liturgies, Christmas traditions

The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols is a service of Christian worship celebrating the birth of Jesus that is traditionally followed at Christmas. The story of the fall of humanity, the promise of the Messiah, and the birth of Jesus is told in nine short Bible readings from Genesis, the prophetic books and the Gospels, interspersed with the singing of Christmas carols, hymns and choir music.
The format was based on an Order drawn up by Edward Benson, later Archbishop of Canterbury but at that time Bishop of Truro, in Cornwall, for use on Christmas Eve (24 December) 1880. Tradition says that he organized a 10:00 p.m. service on Christmas Eve in a temporary wooden structure serving as his cathedral[tpl]cite news|title=Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/articles/2005/12/16/faith_nine_lessons_feature.shtml|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=16 December 2005[/tpl] and that the purpose of the service was to keep men out of the pubs.[tpl]citation|author=Alex Webb|title=Choir that sings to the world|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=24 December 2001[/tpl].
The original liturgy has since been adapted and used by other churches all over the world. Lessons and Carols most often occur in Anglican churches. However, numerous Christian denominations have adopted this service, or a variation on this service, as part of their Christmas celebrations. In the UK, the service has become the standard format for schools' Christmas carol services.
The best-known version is broadcast annually from King's College, Cambridge, on Christmas Eve. It features carols sung by the famous Choir of King's College. Groton School of Groton, Massachusetts, has performed the festival longer than any institution other than King's, holding its first Lessons and Carols in 1928.

Nikolai Semenovich Kardashev (Никола́й Семёнович Кардашёв) (born April 25, 1932 in Moscow) is a Soviet astrophysicist, and is the deputy director of the Russian Space Research Institute (sometimes translated as The Institute for Cosmic Research) of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.
Kardashev graduated from Moscow State University in 1955, following up at Sternberg Astronomical Institute.  He studied under Shklovskii and finished his PhD in 1962.
In 1963 Kardashev examined quasar CTA-102, the first Soviet effort in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).  In this work he came up with the idea that some galactic civilizations would be perhaps millions or billions of years ahead of us, and created the Kardashev classification scheme to rank such civilizations.  Serious Russian efforts in SETI predate similar programs in the US by some years.  Other notable experts in the USSR were Vsevolod Troitskii and Iosif Samuilovich Shklovskii (Kardashev's former professor).
Kardashev became a corresponding (associate) member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Division of General Physics and Astronomy on December 12, 1976. He became a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences on March 21, 1994.

Anil Radhakrishna Kumble  ([tpl]audio|Anil_Kumble.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl] ; ಕನ್ನಡ : ಅನಿಲ್ ಕುಂಬ್ಳೆ; born 17 October 1970) is a former international cricketer and captain of the Indian cricket team. A right-arm leg spin (leg break googly) bowler, he took 619 wickets in Test cricket and remains the third-highest wicket taker—only behind Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne—as of 2012. Unlike his contemporaries, Kumble was not a big turner of the ball, rather relied much on pace and accuracy. His ability to make the ball bounce with subtle variations in pace made him a tough bowler to face for the batsmen; thus earning him the sobriquet "Jumbo". Kumble was selected as the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year in 1993 and one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year three years later.
Born in Bangalore, Karnataka, Kumble developed an early interest in cricket as he grew up watching players like B. S. Chandrasekhar before becoming a full-fledged cricketer. He made his First-class debut at the age of 19 while representing Karnataka. Soon he was picked up for the Austral-Asia Cup in 1990 before making his Test debut against England later that year. Since then he has represented the Indian Test team on more than 132 Test matches and was responsible for many of India's victories. Kumble became a part of the regular ODI team during the early 1990s and held some of the best performances during this time; which included his six for 12 (six wickets for 12 runs) against the West Indies. The year 1996 proved to very successful for him as he was selected for the World Cup and emerged out as the most successful bowler of the tournament; he played seven matches and captured 15 wickets at an average of 18.73. In 1999 while playing against Pakistan, Kumble dismissed all the ten batsmen in a Test match innings.[tpl]cite news|last=Lal|first=Kuldip|title=Kumble takes all 10 wickets as India rout Pakistan|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998-99/PAK_IN_IND/SCORECARDS/PAK_IND_T2_04-08FEB1999_AFP_MR/PAK_IND_T2_07FEB1999_AFP_MR.html|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=ESPN Cricinfo|date=7 February 1999[/tpl] In the event he became the second player to achieve this feat after Jim Laker of England.[tpl]cite news|author=Ayanjit Sen|title= Kumble reaps reward for commitment|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/4061169.stm|publisher=BBC|date=2 December 2004|accessdate=9 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book| last = Garg| first = Chitra| title = Indian Champions Profiles Of Famous Indian Sportspersons| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Fq1wdzqhu6kC&pg=PA128| accessdate = 14 May 2012| year = 2010| publisher = Rajpal & Sons| isbn = 978-81-7028-852-7| pages = 128– [/tpl]
Kumble was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour in 2005. After having played for 18 years, he announced his retirement from international cricket in November 2008.

Pro-ana organizations differ widely in their stances.

Others deny anorexia nervosa is a mental illness and claim instead that it is a "lifestyle choice" that should be respected by doctors and family.
The scientific community recognises anorexia nervosa as a serious illness.

Mountain Province ([tpl]lang-fil|Lalawigang Bulubundukin[/tpl]), is a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. Its capital is Bontoc. 
Mountain Province is sometimes incorrectly named Mountain in some foreign references. The name is also incorrectly shortened by locals to Mt. Province, which in turn is read by native Anglophones as "Mount Province". The province was named so for being in the Cordillera Central mountain range found in the upper realms of Luzon island.
Mountain Province was also the name of the historical province that included most of the current Cordillera provinces. This old province was established by the Americans in 1908 and was later split in 1966 into Mountain Province, Benguet, Kalinga, Apayao and Ifugao.
Mountain province is known for its mummy caves which contain naturally mummified bodies which probably became so due to the humid atmosphere.

[[Services marketing]]
CATEGORIES: Services management and marketing, Marketing

Services marketing is a sub field of marketing which covers the marketing of both goods and services. Goods marketing includes the marketing of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and durables.  Services marketing typically refers to the marketing of both business to consumer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) services. Common examples of service marketing are found in telecommunications, air travel, health care, financial services, all types of hospitality services, car rental services, and professional services.
A service, according to Vargo and Lusch (2004), is ‘the application of specialized competences (knowledge and skills) through deeds, processes, and performances for the benefit of another entity or the entity itself. Services are economic activities, rather than tangible products, offered by one party to another. Rendering a service to recipients, objects, or other assets depends on a time-sensitive performance to bring about the desired result. In exchange for money, time, and effort, service customers expect value from access to goods, labor, professional skills, facilities, networks, and systems; but they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved.Christopher Lovelock and Jochen Wirtz (2011), Services Marketing – People, Technology, Strategy. 7th ed., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall

The Human Torch, also known as Jim Hammond, is a fictional character, a Marvel Comics-owned superhero. Created by writer-artist Carl Burgos, he first appeared in Marvel Comics #1 (Oct.1939), published by Marvel's predecessor, Timely Comics.
The "Human" Torch was actually an android created by scientist Phineas Horton. He possessed the ability to surround himself with fire and control flames. In his earliest appearances, he was portrayed as a science fiction monstrosity, but quickly became a hero.
The Human Torch was one of Timely Comics' three signature characters, along with Captain America and Namor the Sub-Mariner. Like many superheroes, the Human Torch fell into obscurity by the 1950s. In 1961, Marvel recycled his name and powers into a new, unrelated Human Torch, a member of the Fantastic Four (who actually was human). Unlike Captain America and the Sub-Mariner, the original Human Torch has had only a small presence in the post-1950s Marvel comic books and is closely associated with the Golden Age.

[[Maillard reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Food science, Name reactions

The Maillard reaction ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ˈ|j|ɑr[/tpl] [tpl]respell|my|YAR|'[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-fr|majaʁ[/tpl]) is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned foods their desirable flavor. Seared steaks, pan-fried dumplings, breads, and many other foods make use of the effect. It is named after French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard, who first described it in 1912 while attempting to reproduce biological protein synthesis.[tpl]cite book |author=Chichester, C. O. |title=Advances in Food Research (Advances in Food and Nutrition Research) |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-12-016430-2[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=79[/tpl]
The reaction is a form of nonenzymatic browning which typically proceeds rapidly from around [tpl]convert|140|to|165|C[/tpl]. At higher temperatures, caramelization and subsequently pyrolysis become more pronounced.
The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the nucleophilic amino group of the amino acid, and forms a complex mixture of poorly characterized molecules responsible for a range of odors and flavors. This process is accelerated in an alkaline environment (e.g., lye applied to darken pretzels), as the amino groups (RNH3+) are deprotonated and, hence, have an increased nucleophilicity. The type of the amino acid determines the resulting flavor. This reaction is the basis of the flavoring industry. At high temperatures, acrylamide can be formed.[tpl]cite journal|author = Tareke E|title = Analysis of acrylamide, a carcinogen formed in heated foodstuffs|journal = J. Agric. Food. Chem.|volume = 50|issue = 17|pages = 4998–5006|year = 2002|pmid = 12166997|doi = 10.1021/jf020302f|author2 = Rydberg P.|display-authors = 2|last3 = Karlsson|first3 = Patrik|last4 = Eriksson|first4 = Sune|last5 = Törnqvist|first5 = Margareta[/tpl]
In the process, hundreds of different flavor compounds are created. These compounds, in turn, break down to form yet more new flavor compounds, and so on. Each type of food has a very distinctive set of flavor compounds that are formed during the Maillard reaction. It is these same compounds flavor scientists have used over the years to make reaction flavors.

Dayna Curry (born November 4, 1971) is an American citizen, who was held a prisoner by Taliban government of Afghanistan in 2001.http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/curry.mercer/profile.html
Curry was raised in Tennessee. In 1989, she graduated from Brentwood High School in Brentwood, Tennessee and went to Baylor University in Waco, Texas. A social work major, Dayna volunteered at the Waco Center for Youth (a residential facility treats teenagers with emotional and behavioral problems) while she was attending Baylor. After graduation, Curry took a job as a social worker at a high school for troubled teens in Waco.
Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer got to know each other in Waco when they both joined the Antioch Community Church, an evangelical, non-denominational church.
In 2001, Curry and Heather Mercer, along with four German and two Australian aid workers were arrested with them. The aid workers, who were employed by the German based Shelter Now International, were arrested in Kabul, Afghanistan on August 3, 2001 by the ruling Taliban regime. They were charged with preaching Christianity in the strict Islamic state.  The two were visiting a private home in Kabul when they were arrested. The Taliban, which forbid foreigners from visiting local homes, allege that the two women went beyond their activities with helping the needy and began spreading the Christian gospel, a crime under Taliban law. The women had been showing the Jesus film.
A joint trial for the imprisoned aid workers began September 1 in Kabul. At first, it appeared that their punishment might be minor, a short time in prison followed by expulsion from the country. Then came the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Their trial was suspended, and their relatives were ordered out of Kabul. After more than three months of confinement in Taliban prisons they were freed from their cells November 15, 2001, by the U.S. military.

[[Invertebrate paleontology]]

CATEGORIES: Fossils, Subfields of paleontology, Prehistoric invertebrates, Paleozoology, Prehistoric animals, Zoology

Invertebrate paleontology (also spelled Invertebrate palaeontology) is sometimes described as Invertebrate paleozoology or Invertebrate paleobiology.
Whether it is considered to be a subfield of paleontology, paleozoology, or paleobiology, this discipline is the scientific study of prehistoric invertebrates by analyzing invertebrate fossils in the geologic record.
By invertebrates are meant the non-vertebrate creatures of the kingdom Animalia (or Metazoa) in the biotic domain of Eukaryota.  By phyletic definition, these many-celled, sub-vertebrate animals lack a vertebral column, spinal column, vertebrae, backbone, or long, full-length notochord -- in contrast, of course, to the vertebrates in the one phylum of Chordata.
Relatedly, invertebrates have never had a cartilaginous or boney internal skeleton, with its skeletal supports, gill slits, ribs and jaws.  Finally, throughout geologic time, invertebrates have remained non-craniate creatures; that is, they never developed a cranium, nerve-chord brain, skull, or hard protective braincase (unlike many vertebrates).

[[Chinese character encoding]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese-language computing, Encodings of Asian Languages, Korean language

In computing, Chinese character encodings can be used to represent text written in the CJK languages — Chinese, Japanese, Korean — and (rarely) obsolete Vietnamese, all of which use Chinese characters. Several general-purpose character encodings accommodate Chinese characters, and some of them were developed specifically for Chinese.
The following are common Chinese character encoding systems:
Other encoding scheme, such as HZ were also used in early days.
Guobiao is usually displayed using simplified characters and Big5 is usually displayed using traditional characters. There is however no mandated connection between the encoding system and the font used to display the characters; font and encoding are usually tied together for practical reasons.
The conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese is usually problematic, because the simplification of some traditional forms merged two or more different characters into one simplified form.  The traditional to simplified (many-to-one) conversion is technically simple.  The opposite conversion often results in a data loss when converting to early forms of the GB character set (namely GB2312 80): in mapping one-to-many when assigning traditional glyphs to the simplified glyphs, some characters will inevitably be the wrong choices in some of the usages.  Thus simplified to traditional conversion often requires usage context or common phrases to resolve conflicts.  This issue is less of a problem with newer standards such as GB18030 and Unicode which have separate code points for both simplified and traditional characters.
One other issue is that many of the encoding systems are missing characters.  While the missing characters are often literary and not commonly used in ordinary text, this does become a problem because people's names often contain these characters.  An example of the problem is the Taiwanese politician Wang Jian-Hsuan whose second given name is not in some character systems, and PRC Premier Zhu Rongji whose Rong character is not in GB2312. But the newest GB standard, GB18030 has the complete character repertoire of Unicode 4.0, including the Unihan extensions in the Supplementary Ideographic Plane.  
The issue of which encoding to use can also have political implications, as GB is the official standard of the People's Republic of China and Big5 is a de facto standard of Taiwan.  
In contrast to the situation with Japanese, there has been relatively little overt opposition to Unicode, which solves many of the issues involved with GB and Big5.  Unicode is widely regarded as politically neutral, has good support for both simplified and traditional characters, and can be easily converted to and from the GB and Big5.  Furthermore Unicode has the advantage of not being limited only to Chinese, since it can also display many other character sets.

Gordon Giltrap (born 6 April 1948, Brenchley, Kent) is an English acoustic and electric guitarist and composer, whose musical styles cross several genres, including folk, blues, folk rock, pop, classical and rock.
Giltrap started to learn the guitar at the age of twelve. Never receiving any formal tuition on the instrument, he gradually developed his own style and technique.
His musical career started to take off in the 1960s, when he played the folk scene in London alongside contemporaries such as Bert Jansch, John Renbourn and Mike Oldfield. Giltrap cites Jansch as a great influence.
At the age of eighteen Giltrap signed to Transatlantic Records and between 1968-1971 released a folk album (guitar and vocals) every year. While popular on the folk and university circuit, Giltrap reached a turning point and received much greater recognition during the 1970s. During this time Giltrap started to concentrate on more purely instrumental pieces, and in 1976 released the album Visionary, based on the art and poetry of William Blake.
The success of this album prompted Giltrap to move on from the singer-songwriter approach and to form the Gordon Giltrap Band, which toured extensively in the UK at that time. A follow-up album, Perilous Journey, consolidated his success, being named one of the best albums of 1977 by The Sunday Times. It peaked in the UK Albums Chart at #29. A single taken from the album, "Heartsong" received extensive airplay and reached #21 in the UK Singles Chart. The track was later used as the signature tune of the BBC TV series Holiday. Giltrap's next album, Fear of the Dark, was released in 1978.
By the end of the 1970s he had been commissioned to write a number of notable pieces, such as the classically inspired The Brotherhood, based on the art of the Pre-Raphaelites, and The Eye of the Wind Rhapsody,"Gordon Giltrap and Friends at the Symphony Hall", Live Recording (2006), La Cooka Ratcha, Cat. No. LCVP160CD an orchestral work celebrating the exploration of the New World by British sailing ships. In the 1990s, Giltrap played a key role in Cliff Richard's Heathcliff musical, playing the musical narrator. He also composed a number of pieces for the show.
In late 2009, Giltrap started "Three Parts Guitar", a four date world tour with the classical guitarist Raymond Burley and the jazz guitarist John Etheridge.
For two years[tpl]when|date=January 2011[/tpl] Giltrap wrote a regular acoustic column for Total Guitar magazine. An anthology of 26 articles is published in Total Giltrap,Giltrap, Gordon (2002).

James McKeen Cattell (May 25, 1860 – January 20, 1944), American psychologist, was the first professor of psychology in the United States at the University of Pennsylvania and long-time editor and publisher of scientific journals and publications, most notably the journal Science. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public (or SSP), from 1921–1944.
At the beginning of his career, many scientists regarded psychology at best a minor field of study, or at worst a pseudoscience such as phrenology.  Perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, Cattell helped establish psychology as a legitimate science, worthy of study at the highest levels of the academy.  At the time of his death, The New York Times hailed him as "the dean of American science."  Yet Cattell may be best remembered for his uncompromising opposition to American involvement in World War I.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]  His public opposition to the draft led to his dismissal from his position at Columbia University, a move that later led many American universities to establish tenure as a means of protecting unpopular beliefs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

Statler and Waldorf are a pair of Muppet characters. They are two disagreeable old men who first appeared in the television series The Muppet Show and heckled the rest of the cast from their balcony seats. They appeared in all but one episode of the show. In one episode, Waldorf appeared alone at the beginning, explaining that Statler was sick, and that Waldorf's wife would substitute. Her name turned out to be Astoria and she looked remarkably like Statler wearing a dress.
In The Muppet Show, the two were always trashing Fozzie Bear's humor, except for one occasion where Fozzie, with help from Bruce Forsyth, heckled them back. In contrast, they found themselves vastly entertaining and inevitably burst into mutual laughter at their own witticisms (though, they would, on several occasions, heckle each other, too). It is later revealed in the A Muppet Family Christmas special that the two hecklers were friends with Fozzie's mother, Emily Bear. Despite constantly complaining about the show and how terrible some acts were, they would always be back the following week in the best seats in the house. As to why, the original version of The Muppet Show theme song had Statler admitting, "I guess we'll never know."
They also had a penchant for breaking the fourth wall. At the end of one episode, they looked at the camera and asked "Why do you watch it?", and in another one, Statler stated that he didn't care for puppets much, not finding them believable.Statler and Waldorf compilation. youtube.com Waldorf responded with "I don't believe you!"

CATEGORIES: Time and fate goddesses, Norse goddesses

In Norse mythology, a dís ("lady", plural dísir) is a ghost, spirit or deity associated with fate who can be both benevolent and antagonistic towards mortal people. Dísir may act as protective spirits of Norse clans. Their original function was possibly that of fertility goddesses who were the object of both private and official worship called dísablót,The article Diser in Nationalencyklopedin (1991). and their veneration may derive from the worship of the spirits of the dead. The dísir, like the valkyries, norns, and vættir, are almost always referred to collectively.Else Mundal, "The Position of the Individual Gods and Goddesses in Various Types of Sources - With Special Reference to the Female Divinities," (1990) Bergen Open Research Archive, pp. 310-11 (pdf). The North Germanic dísir and West Germanic Idisi are believed by some scholars to be related due to linguistic and mythological similarities,Gods and Myths of Northern Europe by H. Davidson, Penguin Books, 1990, pp. 62-64, ISBN 0-14-013627-4 but the direct evidence of Anglo-Saxon and Continental German mythology is limited. The dísir play roles in Norse texts that resemble those of fylgjur, valkyries, and norns, so that some have suggested dísir is a broad term including the other beings.The article Dis in Nordisk familjebok (1907).

Cypripedium (Greek for the shoe of Venus)[tpl]cite book|last=Schmahl|first=Julius|title=The Legislative Manual of the State of Minnesota|year=1909|publisher=Harrison & Smith Co.|location=Minnesota|page=5[/tpl] is a genus of 47 species of hardy, lady's-slipper orchids native to temperate and colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.
Some grow in the tundra in Alaska and Siberia, which is an unusually cold habitat for orchids. They can withstand extreme cold, growing under the snow and blooming when the snow melts. But, in the wild, most have become rare and close to extinction, due to an ever shrinking natural habitat and overcollection. In the late 20th century, only a single plant of Cypripedium calceolus survived in Britain.
Common names include slipper orchid, lady's slipper, mocassin flower, camel's foot, squirrel foot, steeple cap, Venus' shoes and whippoorwill shoe. 
An abbreviation used in trade journals is 'Cyp'.
The genus has a long history of use, dating back 2,500 years to the Far East, where they were used medicinally.  Several orchid species thought to be extinct in the United Kingdom including one native species in this genus have been found in habitat and are currently the subject of aggressive conservation efforts to protect and restore these showy plants to their native ranges.Juliette Jowit: Ghost orchid comes back from extinction.

The Bernese Mountain Dog, called in German the Berner Sennenhund, is a large breed of dog, one of the four breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps. The name Sennenhund is derived from the German Senne (“alpine pasture”) and Hund (“dog”), as they accompanied the alpine herders and dairymen called Senn. Berner (or Bernese in English) refers to the area of the breed’s origin, in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. This mountain dog was originally kept as a general farm dog.  Large Sennenhunds in the past were also used as draft animals, pulling carts.

[[Narrowband]]

CATEGORIES: Radio terminology

In radio, narrowband describes a channel in which the bandwidth of the message does not significantly exceed the channel's coherence bandwidth.
In the study of wired channels, narrowband implies that the channel over consideration is sufficiently narrow that its frequency response can be considered flat. The message bandwidth will therefore be less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. That is, no channel has perfectly flat fading, but the analysis of many aspects of wireless systems is greatly simplified if flat fading can be assumed.
Narrowband can also be used with the audio spectrum to describe sounds which occupy a narrow range of frequencies. 
In telephony, narrowband is usually considered to cover frequencies 300–3400 Hz.

[[Culhwch and Olwen]]

CATEGORIES: Arthurian literature in Welsh, Mabinogion, Medieval Welsh literature, Welsh mythology, Welsh-language literature

Culhwch and Olwen ([tpl]lang-cy|Culhwch ac Olwen[/tpl]) is a Welsh tale about a hero connected with Arthur and his warriors that survives in only two manuscripts: a complete version in the Red Book of Hergest, ca. 1400, and a fragmented version in the White Book of Rhydderch, ca. 1325. It is the longest of the surviving Welsh prose tales. Certain linguistic evidence indicates it took its present form by the 11th century,The Romance of Arthur: An Anthology of Medieval Texts in Translation, ed. James J. Wilhelm. 1994. 25. making it perhaps the earliest Arthurian tale and one of Wales' earliest extant prose texts.ibid. The title is a later invention and does not occur in early manuscripts.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Lady Charlotte Guest included this tale among those she collected under the title The Mabinogion. Besides the quality of its storytelling it contains several remarkable passages: the description of Culhwch riding on his horse is frequently mentioned for its vividness (a passage reused to similar effect in the 16th century prose "parody" Araith Wgon, as well as in 17th century poetic adaptations of that work),  the fight against the terrible boar Twrch Trwyth certainly has antecedents in Celtic tradition, and the list of King Arthur's retainers recited by the hero is a rhetorical flourish that preserves snippets of Welsh tradition that otherwise would be lost.

In Irish and Scottish folklore, the Sluagh ([tpl]IPA-ga|sɫuə[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-gd|slˠ̪uaɣ|lang[/tpl], modern Irish spelling Slua, English 'horde', 'crowd'.) were the spirits of the restless dead.  Sometimes they were seen as sinners, or generally evil people who were welcome in neither heaven nor hell, nor in the Otherworld, who had also been rejected by the Celtic deities and by the earth itself.  Whichever the underlying belief, they are almost always depicted as troublesome and destructive.  They were seen to fly in groups like flocks of birds, coming from the west, and were known to try to enter the house of a dying person in an effort to carry the soul away with them.  West-facing windows were sometimes kept closed to keep them out.  Some consider the Sluagh to also carry with them the souls of innocent people who were kidnapped by these destructive spirits.
Lewis Spence writes in 'The Magic Arts in Celtic Britain':Spence, Lewis (1945) The Magic Arts in Celtic Britain p. 88 ISBN 0-09-474300-2
In the Western Isles of Scotland the Sluagh, or fairy host, was regarded as composed of the souls of the dead flying through the air, and the feast of the dead at Hallowe'en was likewise the festival of the fairies.

A scientific instrument can be any type of equipment, apparatus or device as is specifically designed, constructed and often, through trial and error, ingeniously refined to apply utmost efficiency in the utilization of  well proven physical principle, relationship or technology to facilitate or enable the pursuit, acquisition, transduction and storage of repeatable, verifiable data, usually consisting of sets numerical measurements made upon otherwise unknown, unproven quantities, properties, phenomena, materials, forces or etc., preferably as those characterized over time by an increasing degree of accuracy and precision and, typically, those initially derived as isolated or dependent variable results from, or empirical observations made during, the course of such experimental procedures as are firmly based upon the scientific method and long accepted tenants of experimental design.
Scientific instruments are part of laboratory equipment, but are considered more sophisticated and more specialized than other measuring instruments as scales, meter sticks, chronometers, thermometers or even power or waveform generators. They are increasingly based upon the integration of computers to improve and simplify control, enhance and extend instrumental functions, conditions, parameter adjustments and data sampling, collection, resolution, analysis (both during and post-process), storage and retrieval. Individual instruments can also be connected as a local area network (LAN) and can be further integrated as part of a laboratory information management system (LIMS), that in addition to having Internet access to databases of such physical properties as compound spectra libraries through the World Wide Web for results comparisons and advanced data analysis as well as the obvious usefulness of now ubiquitous email for rapid exchange of informational text and images, consultation and peer review. Recently, the development have utilized open source principles borrowed from the software industry to rapidly improve low-cost open-source hardware for scientific measurements and to create open source labs.Pearce, Joshua M. 2012. “Building Research Equipment with Free, Open-Source Hardware.” Science 337 (6100): 1303–1304.open access
Some scientific instruments can be quite large in size, like particle colliders that can be several miles in circumference or radio-telescope antennas and antenna arrays used in astrophysics. As you might expect, the converse or nanoscale also has been added to the list of the realm of scientific instrument applications and research, with much of the activity centered around the use of miniaturization in the field of medicine, particularly as non-invasive imaging has exploded on the diagnostic arts and minimally invasive tools and robotics have extended the reach of surgeons of every stripe. In fact, instruments on the scale of a single molecule may soon interact with our bodies at the cellular and biochemical level to collect diagnostic information and provide highly precise medication delivery mechanisms.
Scientific instruments can be found on board sounding rockets, satellites or planetary rovers and controlled by radio telecommunication.

[[Instant camera]]
CATEGORIES: American inventions, Cameras by type, Instant photography

The instant camera is a type of camera that generates a developed film image.  The most popular types to use self-developing film were formerly made by Polaroid Corporation.
The invention of modern instant cameras is generally credited to American scientist Edwin Land, who unveiled the first commercial instant camera, the Land Camera, in 1948, a year after unveiling instant film in New York City.  The earliest instant camera, which consisted of a camera and portable darkroom in a single compartment, was invented in 1923 by Samuel Shlafrock.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=PIpIAAAAEBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=samuel+shlafrock&source=bl&ots=8VAKkxvPMf&sig=AcLlW0XaNxrCYv_MTXx0PT2-m2Y&hl=en&ei=AyZTTLmkEISclgfqu-Ru&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Patent number #1559795; Camera |first=Samuel |last=Shlafrock |publisher=United States Patent Office |date=November 3, 1925[/tpl]

[[Pin-up girl]]

CATEGORIES: Celebrity fandom, Modeling, Pin-up art, Sex- or gender-related stereotypes, Fashion, Clothing

A pin-up girl, also known as a pin-up model, is a model whose mass-produced pictures see wide appeal as popular culture. Pin-ups are intended for informal display, e.g. meant to be "pinned-up" on a wall. Pin-up girls may be glamour models, fashion models, or actresses.
These pictures are also known as cheesecake photos.[tpl]efn|Merriam-Webster Online defines a "cheesecake" as "a photographic display of shapely and scantily clothed female figure".[/tpl]
The term pin-up may also refer to drawings, paintings, and other illustrations done in emulation of these photos (see the list of pin-up artists). The term was first attested to in English in 1941;[tpl]sfnp|Ayto|2006|p=126[/tpl] however, the practice is documented back at least to the 1890s.
The pin-up images could be cut out of magazines or newspapers, or be from postcard or chromo-lithographs, and so on. Such photos often appear on calendars, which are meant to be pinned up anyway. Later, posters of pin-up girls were mass-produced and became an instant hit.  As social standards changed, male subjects also began to be featured in pin-ups.

[[Visual Component Library]]
CATEGORIES: Borland, Component-based software engineering, Pascal libraries, Computer libraries

The Visual Component Library (abbreviated VCL) is a visual component-based object-oriented framework for developing Microsoft Windows applications. It was developed by Borland for use in, and tightly integrated with, its Delphi and C++Builder RAD tools (now owned by CodeGear, division of Embarcadero Technologies). It is written in Object Pascal.
A cross-platform equivalent of the VCL, called CLX (Component Library for Cross Platform), was later developed for use in Delphi, C++Builder and Kylix. However, it was abandoned.
VCL forms a class hierarchy with a common ancestor, the TComponent class (which inherits from TObject, the root class in Delphi Object Pascal). This is a common approach shared by the Java programming language, Smalltalk, C# and many other object-oriented programming languages.
VCL components cover Windows controls like windows (TForm class), controls (e.g., TButton, TCheckBox, TLabel classes) as well as database access (e.g., ADO or IBX components) or Internet connections (Indy components). The component approach allows programmers to extend the VCL with many visual and non-visual additional components. There is a large number of free and commercial component packages. Among them are JEDI, TMS, Developer Express, Mitov Software, Raize Software, TurboPower, IOComp, SDL, DA-SOFT Technologies and many others. 
While not all VCL components are thread-safe, VCL supports multi-threading too. One example is the built in multi-threading support of the OpenWire VCL library.
VCL provides native support for PME (Properties, Methods and Events) model at the .NET level.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
.NET is modeled after VCL, since one of the main architects of the first Delphi versions, Anders Hejlsberg, went to Microsoft and was one of the main architects of .NET there.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
OpenOffice.org and thus LibreOffice contains an unrelated graphic library also called VCL.

[[Homeland for the Jewish people]]

CATEGORIES: History of Israel, Zionism, Jewish history, Palestine, Jewish nationalism

A homeland for the Jewish people was an idea that rose to the fore in the 19th century in the wake of growing anti-Semitism and Jewish assimilation, with many competing proposals considered. Jewish emancipation in Europe paved the way for two ideological solutions to the Jewish Question: cultural assimilation, as envisaged by Moses Mendelssohn, and Zionism, promoted by Theodore Herzl.William Bridgwater, editor-in-chief. The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia Jews, p.906. Second Edition, Dell Publishing Co. York 1964. In the late 19th century, Herzl set out his vision of a Jewish state and homeland for the Jewish people in his book Der Judenstaat. Herzl was later hailed as the founding father of the State of Israel.The Avalon Project : Declaration of Israel's Independence 1948Rights and obligations – Israel Opinion, Ynetnews[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/28/wmid128.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Tim | last=Butcher | title=Hamas U-turn on Israel's right to exist | date=28 June 2006[/tpl] In the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the United Kingdom became the first world power to endorse the establishment in Palestine of a "national home for the Jewish people."

[[Component Library for Cross Platform]]

CATEGORIES: Borland, Component-based software engineering, Pascal libraries, Computer libraries

Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX) (pronounced clicks), is a cross-platform visual component-based framework for developing Microsoft Windows and Linux applications. It is developed by Borland for use in its Kylix, Delphi, and C++ Builder software development environment.
Its aim was to replace the popular Microsoft Foundation Classes with Visual Component Library. CLX was based on Qt by Nokia. The API of CLX almost completely followed VCL. It was envisioned that existing applications using VCL would be recompiled with CLX.
However, due to lacklustre performance on Windows, subtle differences from VCL, and bugs, it didn't become the expected successor to VCL. Commercial failure of Kylix stopped further development of CLX.
In terms of object-oriented approach, CLX forms an object hierarchy where the TObject class serves as the base class. All other classes inherit or indirectly inherit the TObject class.
Today, many concepts that were defined with CLX have been implemented with the Lazarus Component Library (LCL) for the Lazarus IDE. By docking to different widgetsets, the LCL is able to support an even larger spectrum of platforms including Mac OS X and Android.

Mark David Chapman (born May 10, 1955) is an American prison inmate who was convicted for murdering John Lennon on December 8, 1980. Chapman shot Lennon outside The Dakota apartment building in New York City. Chapman fired at Lennon five times, hitting him four times in his back. Chapman remained at the scene reading J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye until the police arrived and arrested him. Chapman repeatedly said that the novel was his statement.
Chapman's legal team put forward an insanity defense based on expert testimony that he was in a delusional and possibly psychotic state at the time, but nearing the trial, Chapman instructed his lawyer that he wanted to plead guilty based on what he had decided was the will of God. Judge Edwards allowed the plea change without further psychiatric assessment after Chapman denied hearing voices, and sentenced Chapman to a prison term of twenty years to life with a stipulation that mental health treatment be provided. Chapman was imprisoned in 1981 and has been denied parole seven times amidst campaigns against his release.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/08/12/chapman.no.parole/index.html | work=CNN | title=Lennon's killer denied parole again | date=August 12, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2010-09-07-chapman-parole_N.htm | title =  John Lennon Killer Chapman Denied Parole In NY | work = USA Today | date = September 7, 2010 | accessdate = December 23, 2011 | first=Carolyn | last=Thompson[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last = Gryta | first = Matt | url = http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/erie-county/article858049.ece | title = Lennon's killer transferred to Wende facility | newspaper = The Buffalo News | date = May 15, 2012 | accessdate = May 15, 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1891 births, 1963 deaths, American screenwriters

Jack Wagner (May 20, 1891Jack Wagner filmography from NYTimes.com – July 13, 1963) was a U.S. screenwriter. Born in Los Angeles, California, USA, he spent many years living in Mexico before returning to Los Angeles to work for D. W. Griffith on his early films.1
Between the years 1909 and 1912, Wagner worked mostly as a furniture painter or set designer and second unit cameraman. He then turned his attention to gag writing and found a job with Mack Sennett writing gags for Keystone Kops shorts. His specialty was comedy construction, especially the famed car chase scenes. When the United States entered World War I, he joined the Army's first motion picture unit with the Signal Corps. He was assigned to filming Air Corps footage. He also filmed battles involving American forces at the Marne, St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne. He was discharged in 1919. He continued working through the teens and 1920s as a gag writer. He also worked as an assistant director and second unit man for such directors as Allan Dwan and Lewis Milestone. 
In the mid-1920s he wrote gags for Harry Langdon and Will Rogers. When talkies arrived, Wagner found himself making the difficult transition from silents. He never achieved the success he found in silents. Yet he found steady work as a gag man, adding bits of dialogue to comedy and dramatic films. During the early years of talkies, he directed and produced Spanish-language films for Fox Studios. In 1934, he helped script The Little Minister with Katharine Hepburn. He also co-write the short film La Cucaracha, which garnered RKO an Academy Award. 
Even after this success, he struggled with writer's block. When he came up with the story idea for A Medal for Benny he again was troubled with putting the story to paper. He had known John Steinbeck for many years. Steinbeck had considered Jack's mother, Edith Wagner, as his first writing coach while growing up in Salinas, California. Jack and his brothers - Max, Blake and Bob - had been steady friends and drinking buddies with Steinbeck since the 1920s. After much work Steinbeck and Jack wrote the script for Benny and it earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Story. He went on to help Steinbeck with another script on The Pearl. He closed out his career as a producer of Mexican films featuring such actresses as Dolores del Río, among others. He died in Los Angeles.

Gwinnett County Transit or GCT is the bus public transit system in Gwinnett County, Georgia, USA, one of metro Atlanta's three most populous suburban counties. (The others are Cobb County, which operates Cobb Community Transit, and Clayton County, which formerly operated Clayton County C-TRAN.)
It was formed in 2000, with express buses starting in November 2001 and local buses in November 2002, and has had greater-than-expected ridership since then. Routes connect to the most populated areas of the county, including Norcross and Lawrenceville. With the assistance of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA), express services are available to Atlanta, connecting with MARTA at the Doraville (NE10), Lindbergh Center (N6), Arts Center (N5), Midtown (N4), North Avenue (N3), Civic Center (N2), Peachtree Center (N1), and Five Points stations. Transfers are free between MARTA and GCT. On December 10, 2008, GCT began the official Breeze Card Pilot Launch on routes 10, 102, and 103A. The pilot is expected to last approximately two months according to a memorandum. On February 2, 2009, the pilot program began on the GRTA Xpress routes (410, 412, and 418) operated by GCT.
Along with Cobb, Gwinnett voted against MARTA in the 1970s and thus was left out of a system.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] The lack of sales tax revenue from the two counties stunted the growth of MARTA; however, GRTA, created by former Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, has been seeking to create other solutions, such as transit for the entire Atlanta and surrounding areas. The Gwinnett Place Community Improvement District (GPCID) along with MARTA are seeking alternatives such as  light rail to Gwinnett through the Gwinnett Place area.
Gwinnett County Transit has 5 local bus routes. The Gwinnett Place Mall Transit Center Hub houses the transfer point for local routes; 10, 30, and 40. Gwinnett County Transit has 6 express bus routes, 3 of which belong to GRTA Xpress. The express routes are 101, 102, 103, 408, 410, 412, and 418. There are also routes 101A and 103A, which are used by reverse commuters on the AM and PM trips.

[[Bushshrike]]

CATEGORIES: Malaconotidae, Bird families

The bushshrikes are smallish passerine bird species. They were formerly classed with the true shrikes in the family Laniidae, but are now considered sufficiently distinctive to be separated from that group as the family Malaconotidae.
This is an African group of species which are found in scrub or open woodland. They are similar in habits to shrikes, hunting insects and other small prey from a perch on a bush. Although similar in build to the shrikes, these tend to be either colourful species or largely black; some species are quite secretive. 
Some bushshrikes have flamboyant displays. The male puffbacks puff out the loose feathers on their rump and lower back, to look almost ball-like.
These are mainly insectivorous forest or scrub birds. Up to four eggs are laid in a cup nest in a tree.

[[Clave (rhythm)]]
CATEGORIES: Cuban music, Rhythm and meter

The clave rhythmic pattern is used as a tool for temporal organization in Afro-Cuban music, such as abakúa, rumba, conga de comparsa, son, son montuno, mambo, salsa, Latin jazz, songo and timba. The five-stroke clave pattern represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms.Gerhard Kubik cited by Agawu, Kofi (2006: 1-46). “Structural Analysis or Cultural Analysis? Comparing Perspectives on the ‘Standard Pattern’ of West African Rhythm” Journal of the American Musicological Society v. 59, n. 1. 
The clave pattern originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions, where it serves essentially the same function as it does in Cuba.

[[History of the United States Navy]]
CATEGORIES: History of the United States Navy

The history of the United States Navy divides into two major periods: the "Old Navy", a small but respected force of sailing ships that was also notable for innovation in the use of ironclads during the American Civil War, and the "New Navy", the result of a modernization effort that began in the 1880s and made it the largest in the world by the 1920s.
The United States Navy recognizes 13 October 1775 as the date of its official establishment, when the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution creating the Continental Navy. With the end of the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Navy was disbanded. Under President George Washington threats to American merchant shipping by pirates in the Mediterranean led to the Naval Act of 1794, which created a permanent standing U.S. Navy. The original six frigates were authorized as part of the Act. Over the next 20 years, the Navy fought the French Navy in the Quasi-War (1798–99), Barbary states in the First and Second Barbary Wars, and the British in the War of 1812. After the War of 1812, the Navy was at peace until the Mexican-American war in 1846, and served to combat piracy in the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas, as well fighting the slave trade. In 1845, the Naval Academy was founded. In 1861, the American Civil War began and the U.S. Navy fought the small Confederate Navy with both sailing ships and ironclad ships while forming a blockade that shut down the Confederacy's civilian shipping. After the Civil war, most of the its ships were laid up in reserve, and by 1878, the Navy was just 6,000 men.
In 1882, the U.S. Navy consisted of many outdated ship designs. Over the next decade, Congress approved building multiple modern armored cruisers and battleships, and by around the start of the 20th century had moved from twelfth place in 1870 to fifth place in terms of numbers of ships. After winning two major battles during the 1898 Spanish-American War, the Navy continued to build more ships, and by the end of World War I had more men and women in uniform than the Royal Navy. The Washington Naval Conference recognized the Navy as equal in capital ship size to the Royal Navy, and during the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy built several aircraft carriers and battleships. The Navy was drawn into World War II after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and over the next four years fought many historic battles including the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, multiple naval battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Much of the Navy's activity concerned the support of landings, not only with the "island-hopping" campaign in the Pacific, but also with the European landings. When the Japanese surrendered, a large flotilla entered Tokyo Bay to witness the formal ceremony conducted on the battleship [tpl]USS|Missouri|BB-63|2[/tpl], on which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. By the end of the war, the Navy had over 1,600 warships.
After World War II ended, the US Navy entered the Cold War and participated in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the Iraq War. Nuclear power and ballistic missile technology led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which were used in the [tpl]sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier[/tpl]s and [tpl]sclass-|Ohio|submarine[/tpl]s. By 1978, the number of ships had dwindled to less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy. Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.

[[Mesoproterozoic]]

CATEGORIES: Geologic time scale, Proterozoic

The Mesoproterozoic Era is a geologic era that occurred from [tpl]Ma|Mesoproterozoic|Neoproterozoic[/tpl]. The Mesoproterozoic was the first period of Earth's history of which a respectable geological record survives. Continents existed in the Paleoproterozoic, but we know little about them. The continental masses of the Mesoproterozoic are more or less the same ones that are with us today.
The major events of this era are the breakup of the Columbia supercontinent, the formation of the Rodinia supercontinent, and the evolution of sexual reproduction.
This era is marked by the further development of continental plates and plate tectonics.
The first large-scale mountain building episode, the Grenville Orogeny, for which extensive evidence still survives, happened in this period.
This era was the high point of the Stromatolites before they declined in the Neoproterozoic.
The era saw the development of sexual reproduction, which greatly increased the complexity of life to come. It was the start of development of communal living among organisms, the multicellular organisms.
It was an Era of apparently critical, but still poorly understood, changes in the chemistry of the sea, the sediments of the earth, and the composition of the air. Oxygen levels had risen to perhaps 1% of today's levels at the beginning of the era and continued rising throughout the Era.
Clearly the era did see large quantities of organisms in at least some areas at some periods: The EIA/ARI Technically Recoverable Shale Oil and Shale Gas Resources: An Assessment of 137 Shale Formations in 41 Countries Outside the United States of June 2013 estimated around 194 trillion cubic feet of gas in place (ca. 44 trillion recoverable) and around 93 billion barrels of oil in place (ca. 4.7 billion recoverable) in the Lower Kyalla and Middle Velkerri formations alone of the Beetaloo Basin in Australia's Northern Territory.U.

The Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) is a species of passerine bird of uncertain relation. It is tentatively placed in the tanager family, but classified as incertae sedis by other authorities such as the American Ornithologists' Union. Its classification is debated, and it is often placed in its own family: Coerebidae. It has recently been suggested the Bananaquit should be split into three species, but this has yet to receive widespread recognition. This small, active nectarivore is found in warmer parts of the Americas, and is generally common.

Marc Lépine (born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi) (October 26, 1964 – December 6, 1989) was a 25-year-old from Montreal, Canada who murdered fourteen women and wounded ten women and four menNote: Many sources state 13 were wounded, but the Coroner's report and the police officer responsible for the investigation state that 14 were wounded at the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, in the École Polytechnique massacre, also known as the "Montreal Massacre".[ref]
</ref><ref name =L43>[tpl]Harvnb|Lépine & Gagné|2008|p=187[/tpl]</ref>
Lépine was born in Montreal, the son of a Canadian nurse and an Algerian businessman.  His father was abusive and contemptuous of women.   After his parents separated when he was seven, his mother returned to nursing to support her children. Lépine and his younger sister lived with other families, seeing their mother on weekends. Lépine was considered bright but withdrawn and having difficulties with peer and family relationships. He changed his name to Marc Lépine at the age of 14 giving as the reason his hatred of his father. Lépine's application to the Canadian Forces was rejected, and in 1982 he began a science program at a college, switching to a more technical program after one year. In 1986, he dropped out of the course in his final term, and was subsequently fired from his job at a hospital due to his poor attitude. He began a computer programming course in 1988, and again abandoned it before completion. Lépine twice applied for admission to the École Polytechnique, but lacked two required compulsory courses.
After several months of planning, Lépine entered the École Polytechnique de Montréal, on the afternoon of December 6, 1989.  He had long complained about women working in non-traditional jobs, and after separating men and women in a classroom, he shot the women, claiming that he was fighting feminism.  He then moved into other parts of the building, targeting women as he went, before killing himself. His suicide note blamed feminists for ruining his life.
Lépine's actions have been variously ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, or societal factors such as poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media. The massacre is regarded by criminologists as an example of a hate crime against women, and by feminists and government officials as misogynist attack and an example of the larger issue of violence against women.

Sinepuxent or Sinepuxent Town was a village in Worcester County, Maryland, located on Sinepuxent Neck across Sinepuxent Bay from the barrier island of Assateague.  The village was destroyed by a hurricane in 1818Stewart, Donald F., "When the Ships' Cannon Roared off Old Worcester Coast", Maryland Beachcomber (August 24, 1979). and never rebuilt.  Its location arose in large part from its convenience to ocean-going ships: an inlet—Sinepuxent Inlet—allowed access through Assateague Island from the Atlantic Ocean to Sinepuxent Bay, until it was closed by the same hurricane that destroyed the village.
Sinepuxent was the birthplace of U.S. Navy officer Stephen Decatur in 1779.

[[Decametre]]

CATEGORIES: Units of length, Orders of magnitude (length)

A decametre or dekametre (American spelling: dekameter, earlier decameter; symbol dam, sometimes Dm or dkm) is a very rarely used unit of length in the metric system, equal to ten metres, the SI base unit of length. It can be written in scientific notation as [tpl]Nowrap|1 E+1 m[/tpl] (exponential notation), meaning [tpl]Nowrap|10 × 1 m[/tpl].
This measure is included in the SI mostly for completeness: in principle, any combination of prefix and unit is permissible, but many are rarely used in practice. One practical use of the decameter is for altitude of geopotential heights in meteorology. Meteorologists also use another seldom encountered SI prefix: hecto- in hectopascal (hPa).  The volumetric form (see below) cubic decametre is convenient for describing large volumes of water such as in rivers and lakes.

C-QUAM is the method of AM stereo broadcasting used in Canada, the United States and most other countries. It was invented in 1977 by Norman Parker, Francis Hilbert, and Yoshio Sakaie, and published in an IEEE journal.
Using circuitry developed by Motorola, C-QUAM uses quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) to encode the stereo separation signal.  This extra signal is then stripped down in such a way that it is compatible with the envelope detector of older receivers (hence the name C-QUAM, i.e. Compatible QUadrature Amplitude Modulation).  A 25 Hz pilot tone is added to trigger receivers; it is not necessary for the reconstruction of the original audio sources.

The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company.
On 10 October 2008, Geike Arnaert, the lead singer of the band, announced she would leave the group by the end of the year to pursue her solo career.

Gertrude Margaret Lowthian Bell, CBE (14 July 1868 – 12 July 1926) was an English writer, traveller, political officer, administrator, archaeologist and spy who explored, mapped, and became highly influential to British imperial policy-making due to her skill and contacts, built up through extensive travels in Greater Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and Arabia. Along with T. E. Lawrence, Bell helped establish the Hashemite dynasties in what is today Jordan as well as in Iraq.
She played a major role in establishing and helping administer the modern state of Iraq, utilising her unique perspective from her travels and relations with tribal leaders throughout the Middle East. During her lifetime she was highly esteemed and trusted by British officials and given an immense amount of power for a woman at the time. She has been described as "one of the few representatives of His Majesty's Government remembered by the Arabs with anything resembling affection".[tpl]citation |last1=Meyer |first1=Karl E. |first2=Shareen B. |last2=Brysac |title=Kingmakers: The Invention of the Modern Middle East |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

[[Autocannon]]
CATEGORIES: Automatic cannons, Close-in weapon systems

An autocannon or automatic cannon is a rapid-fire projectile weapon that fires armour piercing or explosive shells, as opposed to the bullet fired by a machine gun. Autocannons often have a larger calibre than a machine gun (e.g., 20 mm or greater). Usually, autocannons are smaller than a field gun or other artillery, and are mechanically loaded for a faster rate of fire. They can use a variety of ammunition: common shells include high-explosive dual-purpose types (HEDP), any variety of armour-piercing (AP) types, such as composite rigid (APCR) or discarding sabot types (APDS).
Although capable of generating a high rate of fire, autocannons overheat if used for sustained fire, and are limited by the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. Both the US 25 mm Bushmaster and the British 30 mm Rarden have relatively slow rates of fire so as not to use ammunition too fast. The rate of fire of a modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute (in the case of the British Rarden), to 2,500 rounds per minute with the GIAT 30. Systems with multiple barrels can have rates of fire of over 10,000 rounds per minute, (the Russian GSh-6-23 for example).The GSh-6-30K, a six-barreled Russian rotary cannon, has a ROF of 6,000 rounds per minute. Williams, p. 241. Such extremely high rates of fire are effectively employed by aircraft in air-to-air combat, where the target dwell time is short and weapons are typically operated in brief bursts.

[[Culture of the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: British culture

The culture of the United Kingdom is the pattern of human activity and symbolism associated with the United Kingdom and its people. It is influenced by the UK's history as a developed island country, a liberal democracy and a major power, its predominantly Christian religious life, and its composition of four countries—England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales—each of which has distinct customs, cultures and symbolism. The wider culture of Europe has also influenced British culture, and Humanism, Protestantism and representative democracy developed from broader Western culture.
British literature, music, cinema, art, theatre, media, television, philosophy and architecture are influential and respected across the world. The United Kingdom is also prominent in science and technology. Sport is an important part of British culture; numerous sports originated in the country, including football.

In mathematics, a building (also Tits building, Bruhat–Tits building, named after François Bruhat and Jacques Tits) is a combinatorial and geometric structure which simultaneously  generalizes certain aspects of flag manifolds, finite projective planes, and Riemannian symmetric spaces. Initially introduced by Jacques Tits as a means to understand the structure of exceptional groups of Lie type, the theory has also been used to study the geometry and topology of homogeneous spaces of p-adic Lie groups and their discrete subgroups of symmetries, in the same way that trees have been used to study free groups.

[[Coherentism]]

CATEGORIES: Epistemological theories, Justification, Coherentism

Coherentism is the name given to certain philosophical theories in modern epistemology, the study of knowledge. There are two distinct types of coherentism. One is the coherence theory of truth; the other, the coherence theory of justification. The coherentist theory of justification characterizes epistemic justification as a property of a belief only if that belief is a member of a coherent set. What distinguishes coherentism from other theories of justification is that the set is the primary bearer of justification.Klein, P. D. (2007). Human Knowledge and the Infinite Progress of Reasoning. Philosophical Studies , 134 (1), 1-17.  As an epistemological theory, coherentism opposes foundationalism and infinitism and attempts to offer a solution to the regress argument. In this epistemological capacity, it is a theory about how belief can be justified.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]
Coherentism is a view about the structure of justification or knowledge. The coherentist's thesis is normally formulated in terms of a denial of its contrary foundationalism. Coherentism thus claims, minimally, that not all knowledge and justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of noninferential knowledge or justified belief.
This negative construal of coherentism occurs because of the prominence of the regress problem in the history of epistemology, and the long-held assumption that only foundationalism provides an adequate, non-skeptical solution to that problem. After responding to the regress problem by denying foundationalism, coherentists normally characterize their view positively by replacing the foundationalism metaphor of a building as a model for the structure of knowledge with different metaphors, such as the metaphor which models our knowledge on a ship at sea whose seaworthiness must be ensured by repairs to any part in need of it. Coherentists typically hold that justification is solely a function of some relationship between beliefs, none of which are privileged beliefs in the way maintained by foundationalists, with different varieties of coherentism individuated by the specific relationship among beliefs identified as coherence.

The collapse of Iceland's banking system led to vocal demands for his resignation both by members of the Icelandic public and by the new Icelandic Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, which resulted in him being replaced as head of the Central Bank in March 2009. In September 2009 he was hired as the editor of Morgunblaðið, one of Iceland's largest newspapers, a decision that caused nationwide controversy and was followed by resignations and widespread terminated subscriptions.

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 ([tpl]lang-ru|Русско-турецкая война (1877–1878 гг.)[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ota|۹۳ حربی[/tpl], Doksan Üç Harbi ('93 Harbi, "93 War"); [tpl]lang-tr|93 Harbi[/tpl] or 1877–78 Osmanlı-Rus Savaşı; [tpl]lang-bg|Руско-турска освободителна война (1877–1878 г.)[/tpl]) was a conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the Eastern Orthodox coalition led by the Russian Empire and composed of several Balkan countries. Fought in the Balkans and in the Caucasus, it originated in emerging 19th-century Balkan nationalism. Additional factors include the Russian hopes of recovering territorial losses suffered during the Crimean War, re-establishing itself in the Black Sea and supporting the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire.
As a result of the war, Russia succeeded in claiming several provinces in the Caucasus, namely Kars and Batumi. The principalities of Romania (which was also forced by Russia to cede the Budjak region of the Danube Delta, in spite of an existing treaty of alliance between the two countries), Serbia and Montenegro, each of which had had de facto sovereignty for some time, formally proclaimed independence from the Ottoman Empire. After almost five centuries of Ottoman domination (1396–1878), the Bulgarian state was re-established as the Principality of Bulgaria, covering the land between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains (except Northern Dobrudja which was given to Romania) as well as the region of Sofia, which became the new state's capital. The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria-Hungary to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Kingdom to take over Cyprus.

The Oxford Movement was a movement of High Church Anglicans, eventually developing into Anglo-Catholicism. The movement, whose members were often associated with the University of Oxford, argued for the reinstatement of lost Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology. They conceived of the Anglican Church as one of three branches of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.
It was also known as the Tractarian Movement after its series of publications Tracts for the Times, published between 1833 and 1841. The group was also disparagingly called Newmanites (pre-1845) and Puseyites (post-1845) after two prominent Tractarians, John Henry Newman and Edward Bouverie Pusey. Other well-known Tractarians included John Keble, Charles Marriott, Richard Hurrell Froude, Robert Wilberforce, Isaac Williams and William Palmer.

Harmony is a small unincorporated community in Caroline County, Maryland, United States.[tpl]gnis|584869[/tpl] It is little more than an intersection of state Routes 16 and 578 on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Its original name was Fowling Creek named after a stream nearby that is a tributary of the Choptank River.
There is a small country store with one gas pump, a church, a local produce stand, and lots of farmland.  While many of the farmers in the area are of German descent as can be seen in last names such as Kraus, Steenken, and Worm; they settled later after the civil war filling the void of the men lost in the war. The older families of Towers, Todd, and Wyddel were the original settlers that came from England in the early eighteenth century as can be confirmed from the original patents granted to them one of which is Wyddels Venture, the oldest century farm in the county.
The soil is sandy and requires irrigation, unlike many farms in nearby Talbot County.  There are many cash crops grown such as sweet corn, cantaloupes, tomatoes, squash, etc...  There are quite a few migrant camps for Mexican workers who help with the crops in the summer.  Most farms also have chicken houses as a second means of income.

[[Tektite]]

CATEGORIES: Glass in nature, Impact event minerals, Amorphous solids

Tektites (from Greek τηκτός "tēktos", molten) are gravel-size bodies that are composed of black, green, brown or gray, natural glass that are formed from terrestrial debris ejected during extraterrestrial impacts. They are characterized by 1. a fairly homogeneous composition; 2. an extremely low content of water and other volatiles; 3. an abundant lechatelierite; 4. a general lack of microscopic crystals known as microlites and chemical relation to the local bedrock or local sediments; and 5. their distribution within geographically extensive strewnfields. Tektites generally range in size from centimeters to millimeters. Millimeters-size tektites are known as microtektites.French, B. M. (1998) Traces of Catastrophe: A Handbook of Shock-Metamorphic Effects in Terrestrial Meteorite Impact Structures. LPI Contribution No. 954. Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, Texas. 120 pp.McCall, G. J. H. (2001) Tektites in the Geological Record: Showers of Glass from the Sky.

Although tektites are superficially similar to some terrestrial volcanic glasses (obsidians), they have unusual distinctive physical characteristics that distinguish them from such glasses. First, they are completely glassy and lack any microlites or phenocrysts unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Second, although high in silica (>65 wt%), the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of tektites is closer to those of shales and similar sedimentary rocks and quite different from the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of terrestrial volcanic glasses. Third, tektites contain virtually no water (The difference in water content can be used to distinguish tektites from terrestrial volcanic glasses. When heated to their melting point, terrestrial volcanic glasses will turn into a foamy glass because of their content of water and other volatiles. Unlike terrestrial volcanic glass, a tektite will produce only a few bubbles at most when heated to its melting point because of its much lower water and other volatiles content.O'Keefe, J. A., (1978) Tektites and Their Origin. Developments in petrology vol. 4. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, New York, New York. 254 pp. ISBN 9780444413505
On the basis of morphology and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on the basis of their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10 cm in size and 24 kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite and coesite.
Microtektites, the fourth group of tektites, are tektites that are less than 1 mm in size. They exhibit a variety of shapes ranging from spherical to dumbbell, disc, oval, and teardrop. The color of microtektites ranges from colorless and transparent to yellowish and pale brown. They frequently contain bubbles and lechatelierite inclusions. Microtektites are typically found in deep-sea sediments that are of the same age as one of the four known strewn fields. Microtektites, which are part of the Australasian strewn field, have also been found on land within Chinese loess deposits and sediment-filled joints and decimeter-sized weathering pits developed within glacially eroded granite outcrops of the Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica.Chunlai, L., O.

[[Modernist poetry in English]]

CATEGORIES: Modernism, Modernist poetry in English

Modernist poetry in English started in the early years of the 20th century with the appearance of the Imagists. In common with many other modernists, these poets wrote in reaction to the perceived excesses of Victorian poetry, with its emphasis on traditional formalism and ornate diction. In many respects, their criticism echoes what William Wordsworth wrote in Preface to Lyrical Ballads to instigate the Romantic movement in British poetry over a century earlier, criticising the gauche and pompous school which then pervaded, and seeking to bring poetry to the layman.
Modernists saw themselves as looking back to the best practices of poets in earlier periods and other cultures. Their models included ancient Greek literature, Chinese and Japanese poetry, the troubadours, Dante and the medieval Italian philosophical poets (such as Guido Cavalcanti), and the English Metaphysical poets.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Much of early modernist poetry took the form of short, compact lyrics. As it developed, however, longer poems came to the foreground. These represent the of the modernist movement to the 20th-century English poetic canon.

Middletown is a city located in Middlesex County, Connecticut, along the Connecticut River, in the central part of the state, 16 miles (26 km) south of Hartford. In 1650, it was incorporated as a town under its original Indian name, Mattabeseck. It received its present name in 1653. Middletown was included within Hartford County upon its creation on May 10, 1666. In 1784, the central settlement was incorporated as a city distinct from the town. Both were included within newly formed Middlesex County in May of 1785. In 1923, the City of Middletown was consolidated with the Town, making the city limits of the city quite extensive. Originally a busy sailing port and then an industrial center, it is now largely residential with its downtown serving as a college town for Wesleyan University. Middletown was the county seat of Middlesex County from its creation in 1785 until the elimination of county government in 1960. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 47,648. Middletown, Connecticut is considered the southernmost city in the Hartford-Springfield Knowledge Corridor Metropolitan Region, which features a combined metro population of 1.9 million.

[[Dereliction of duty]]

CATEGORIES: Military law

Dereliction of duty is a specific offense under United States Code Title 10,892. Article 92 and applies to all branches of the US military. A service member who is derelict has willfully refused to perform his duties (or follow a given order) or has incapacitated himself in such a way that he cannot perform his duties. Such incapacitation includes the person falling asleep while on duty requiring wakefulness, his getting drunk or otherwise intoxicated and consequently being unable to perform his duties, shooting himself and thus being unable to perform any duty, or his vacating his post contrary to regulations. Article 92 also applies to service members whose acts or omissions rise to the level of criminally negligent behavior. The first such case charged occurred during World War II, when Army Air Force Lieutenants William Sincock and Theodore Balides were court-martialed for dereliction of duty when they mistakenly dropped bombs on Zürich, a city of Switzerland, which was a neutral country during that war. Both men were later acquitted.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj00/sum00/helmreich.html | title = The Diplomacy of Apology: U.S. Bombings of Switzerland during World War II | accessdate = 2010-12-09 | last = Helmreich | first = Jonathan | date = Summer 2000 | work = Aerospace Power Journal | publisher = Air University[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Saddle Creek Records, Conor Oberst, Record labels established in 1993, American independent record labels, Companies based in Omaha, Nebraska, Music of Omaha, Nebraska, Indie rock record labels

Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska. Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 (as Lumberjack Records). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel. The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst (then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia, currently of Cursive and The Good Life), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the "Creekers". Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to "Spend an evening with Saddle Creek" (later to be the title of the label's DVD.)Spend an Evening With Saddle Creek. Dir. Jason Kulbel and Rob Walters. DVD. Plexifilm, 2005. Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship. Distribution is handled by the Alternative Distribution Alliance, which is under the Warner Music Group umbrella.
Saddle Creek Records continues to be the flagship label of a style of music called "The Omaha Sound", characterized by a slight country twang.  This is increasingly inaccurate, though, with the rise of more electronic sounds such as those favored by The Faint and Broken Spindles.  The eclectic sounds of Saddle Creek's disparate member bands is somewhat explained by their history; a number of the original members of the label attended grade school together.Justin Oberst was 13 years old at the time of the first Lumberjack release, Conor Oberst's "Water" A "sister label", of sorts, to Saddle Creek is Team Love, started by Conor Oberst in 2004.

CATEGORIES: History of the United Kingdom, Capital punishment in the United Kingdom, English criminal law

Capital punishment in the United Kingdom was used from the creation of the state in 1707 until the practice was abolished in the 20th century. The last executions in the United Kingdom were by hanging, and took place in 1964, prior to capital punishment being abolished for murder (in 1965 in Great Britain and in 1973 in Northern Ireland). Although not applied since, the death penalty was abolished in all circumstances in 1998. In 2004 the 13th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights became binding on the United Kingdom, prohibiting the restoration of the death penalty for as long as the UK is a party to the Convention.[tpl]Harvnb|Hoffman|Rowe|2010|p=148[/tpl]

[[Zygophyllales]]

CATEGORIES: Zygophyllales, Angiosperm orders

The Zygophyllales are an order of dicotyledon plants, comprising the following two families:
According to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG II) both families are unplaced to order, but nevertheless included in the Eurosids I. The APG III system of 2009, however, recognized this order. Even if the monogeneric family Krameriaceae shares little common traits with the family Zygophyllaceae, researchers see little advantage in keeping it as a separate family (e.g. Sheahan and Chase). The name Zygophyllales can be used if one finds it appropriate to place both families into an order.
Under the Cronquist system, the Zygophyllaceae were included within the Sapindales, and the Krameriaceae within the Polygalales.

[[Blackmore Vale]]
CATEGORIES: Valleys of England, Geography of Somerset, Natural regions of Dorset

The Blackmore Vale ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|l|æ|k|m|ɔər[/tpl]; less commonly spelt Blackmoor) is a vale, or wide valley, in north Dorset, and to a lesser extent south Somerset and southwest Wiltshire in southern England.  The vale is part of the Stour valley,  part of the Dorset AONB and part of the natural region known as the Blackmoor Vale and Vale of Wardour.  The vale is delimited by the Dorset Downs, a chalk ridge to the south; Cranborne Chase, chalk hills to the east; and the watershed between the Stour and Yeo valleys to the northwest (which generally follows close to the borders between north Dorset, south Somerset and west Dorset).  The River Stour flows out of the vale at Blandford Forum in the southeast, a town sandwiched between the Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase.  The river flows into the vale north of Gillingham.
When viewed from above (e.g. from the chalk escarpments) the vale appears quite uniform - a large expanse of green, lush, low-lying land - but in geological terms it comprises alternating belts of different clay and limestone soils (and greensand at the foot of the chalk), which give rise to subtle variations in topography and appearance, and which have an impact on land use. The majority of human settlements are built on the drier strips of limestone, whereas the more poorly draining clays (which comprise the greater bulk of the area) are more sparsely populated,Wightman, R.,"Portrait Of Dorset", Hale, 1983, pp16-18 supporting mostly small farms, dotted across the vale. Due to the clay soils, land use is predominantly dairy farming. Until it was closed in 1998, Sturminster Newton livestock market was the busiest weekly livestock market in Britain. 
The vale, in particular the village of Marnhull ("Marlott"), is the opening backdrop for Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles; he also lived and wrote in Sturminster Newton for a time.  Poet William Barnes also lived in Sturminster Newton.  Douglas Adams and Robert Boyle lived in Stalbridge for part of their lives.
Settlements in the vale include:

The Oxalidales is an order of flowering plants, included within the rosid subgroup of eudicots. Compound leaves are common in Oxalidales and the majority of the species in this order have five or six sepals and petals. The following families are typically placed here:Stephens, P.F. (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 9, June 2008. http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/
The Cephalotaceae family contains a single species, a pitcher plant found in Southwest Australia.
Under the Cronquist system, most of the above families were placed in the Rosales. The Oxalidaceae were placed in the Geraniales, and the Elaeocarpaceae split between the Malvales and Polygalales, in the latter case being treated as the Tremandraceae.

Medical social work is a sub-discipline of social work, also known as hospital social work. Medical social workers typically work in a hospital, skilled nursing facility or hospice, have a graduate degree in the field, and work with patients and their families in need of psychosocial help.  Medical social workers assess the psychosocial functioning of patients and families and intervene as necessary.  Interventions may include connecting patients and families to necessary resources and supports in the community; providing psychotherapy, supportive counseling, or grief counseling; or helping a patient to expand and strengthen their network of social supports.
Medical social workers typically work on an interdisciplinary team with professionals of other disciplines (such as medicine, nursing, physical, occupational, speech and recreational therapy, etc.)

CATEGORIES: Gunnerales, Angiosperm orders

The Gunnerales are an order of flowering plants. In the APG III system (2009) it contains two genera: Gunnera (in family Gunneraceae) and Myrothamnus (in family Myrothamnaceae). In the Cronquist system (1981), the Gunneraceae were in the Haloragales and Myrothamnaceae in the Hamamelidales.
DNA analysis was definitive, but the grouping of both families was a surprise, given their very dissimilar morphologies. In Cronquist's old system (1981, 1988), and Takhtajan's (1997), the Gunneraceae were in the Rosidae, and the Myrothamnaceae were in the Hamamelids.
In modern classification systems such as APGIII, this order was the first to derive from the core eudicots.

[[Searing]]
CATEGORIES: Cooking techniques

Searing (or pan searing) is a technique used in grilling, baking, braising, roasting, sautéing, etc., in which the surface of the food (usually meat, poultry or fish) is cooked at high temperature so a caramelized crust forms. Similar techniques, browning and blackening, are typically used to sear all sides of a particular piece of meat, fish, poultry, etc. before finishing it in the oven. To obtain the desired brown or black crust, the meat surface must exceed 150 °C (300 °F), so searing requires the meat surface be free of water, which boils at around 100 °C (212 °F).
Although often said to "lock in the moisture" or "seal in the juices", searing has been demonstrated[tpl]cite book | author=McGee, Harold | title=On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | isbn=0-684-80001-2[/tpl] Page 161, "The Searing Question". to result in a greater net loss of moisture versus cooking to the same internal temperature without first searing. Nonetheless, it remains an essential technique in cooking meat for several reasons:
Typically in grilling, the food will be seared over very high heat and then moved to a lower-temperature area of the grill to finish cooking. In braising, the seared surface acts to flavor, color and otherwise enrich the liquid in which the food is being cooked.

The Buggery Act 1533, formally An Acte for the punysshement of the vice of Buggerie (25 Hen. 8 c. 6), was an Act of the Parliament of England that was passed during the reign of Henry VIII. It was the country's first civil sodomy law, such offences having previously been dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts.
The Act defined buggery as an unnatural sexual act against the will of God and man. This was later defined by the courts to include only anal penetration and bestiality.R v Jacobs (1817) Russ & Ry 331 confirmed that buggery related only to intercourse per anum by a man with a man or woman, or intercourse per anum or per vaginam by either a man or a woman with an animal. Other forms of "unnatural intercourse" may amount to indecent assault or gross indecency, but do not constitute buggery (see generally: Smith & Hogan, Criminal Law (10th ed.) ISBN 0-406-94801-1) The Act remained in force until it was repealed and replaced by the Offences against the Person Act 1828, and buggery would remain a capital offence until 1861.

Vaginismus, sometimes anglicized vaginism, is the condition that affects a woman's ability to engage in any form of vaginal penetration, including sexual intercourse, insertion of tampons and/or menstrual cups, and the penetration involved in gynecological examinations. This is presumed to be the result of an involuntary vaginal muscle spasm, which makes any kind of vaginal penetration—including sexual intercourse—painful or impossible. While there is a lack of evidence to definitively identify which muscle is responsible for the spasm, the pubococcygeus muscle, sometimes referred to as the "PC muscle", is most often suggested. Other muscles such as the levator ani, bulbocavernosus, circumvaginal, and perivaginal muscles have also been suggested.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lahaie|first=MA|coauthors=Boyer, SC; Amsel, R; Khalifé, S; Binik, YM|title=Vaginismus: a review of the literature on the classification/diagnosis, etiology and treatment.|journal=Women's health (London, England)|date=Sep 2010|volume=6|issue=5|pages=705–19|pmid=20887170|accessdate=8 April 2014[/tpl]
A woman suffering from vaginismus does not consciously control the spasm. The vaginismic reflex can be compared to the response of the eye shutting when an object comes towards it.

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Pernambuco

Camaragibe (population 143.210) is a city in northeastern Brazil, in the State of Pernambuco. It lies near Recife at 8.00° South, 35.04° West.
Currently, Camaragibe is run by Jorge Alexandre (from the political party PSDB, the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy) and Reginaldo Albuquerque (The Vice-mayor).
The lands now belonging to the city were used as a reserve of wood, and then for sugar planting. It was populated by natives, until the arrival of Portuguese with Duarte Coelho Pereira, around 1500. After the Portuguese arrival, however, the natives where not completely driven from the area. Instead, they lived "peacefully" with the invaders. 
In the 16th century the city (then just an engenho) was considered one of richest in the region until the Dutch invasion in 1645. At that time, the farm was burned to the ground by the natives.
In 13 May 1982, Camaragibe, which was then part of the bigger city São Lourenço da Mata, was elevated to the category of city.
The small city is considered among the most densely populated urban areas in the world because of the very accelerated growth that the city experienced from the emancipation until now.

Islamic traditional use of the name goes back to Ali ibn Abu Talib, the Islamic leader and cousin of Muhammad, but the name is identical in form and meaning to the [tpl]lang-he | עֵלִי [/tpl], Eli, which goes back to the Eli in the Books of Samuel.
The name Ali can arise away from Islam; among English-speakers as short for male and female names starting with "Al-", or the Old Norse man's name Áli. It can also be a girl's name, as a shortened form of Alexandra or Alison.
Ali is also a Finnish male given name, derived from Aleksanteri.Kustaa Vilkuna, Marketta Huitu and Pirjo Mikkonen. Etunimet, published in Joka kodin suuri nimikirja. Suuri Suomalainen Kirjakerho, 1990. Also, households by a river are often named Ali- "downstream" and Yli- "upstream", thus the component Ali- occurs in surnames derived from these, e.g. Ali-Yrkkö "the house downstream of Yrkkö".  Finnish people whose names start "Ali..." are sometimes suspected abroad of being terror suspects and thus are excessively targeted for security checks at U.S and German airports. http://yle.fi/uutiset/ali-nimisia_suomalaisia_epaillaan_muslimeiksi_yhdysvaltain_rajalla/6312781 (in Finnish)

[[Telephone keypad]]

CATEGORIES: Telephony equipment, Telephone numbers

A telephone keypad is a keypad that appears on a "Touch Tone" telephone. It was standardised when the dual-tone multi-frequency system in the new push-button telephone was introduced in the 1960s, which gradually replaced the rotary dial.Engineering Pathway – Bell Telephone introduces push button telephone – by Alice Agogino – November 18th, 2009 The invention of the keypad is attributed to John E. Karlin, an industrial psychologist at Bell Labs. The contemporary keypad is laid out in a 4×3 grid, although the original DTMF system in the new keypad had an additional column for four now-defunct menu selector keys. Most keypads have a star key or asterisk key on the bottom left and a hash key on the bottom right.

Freediving (also free diving,free-diving) is a form of underwater diving that relies on a diver's ability to hold his or her breath until resurfacing rather than on the use of a breathing apparatus such as scuba gear. Examples include breath-hold spear fishing, freedive photography, recreational breath-hold diving, apnea competitions, freediving short sections of underwater passages when caving, and to some degree, snorkeling. The activity that garners the most public attention is the extreme sport of competitive apnea in which competitors attempt to attain great depths, times, or distances on a single breath.

Tipton is a town in the Sandwell borough of the West Midlands, England, with a population of around 38,777 as of the 2011 census. Tipton is located about halfway between Birmingham and Wolverhampton. It is a part of the West Midlands conurbation and is a part of the Black Country.
Historically within Staffordshire, Tipton was an urban district until 1938, when it became a municipal borough. The vast majority of the Borough of Tipton was transferred into West Bromwich County Borough in 1966, although the Tividale part of the town became part of Warley and a small section of the west of the town was incorporated into Dudley. Along with the rest of West Bromwich and Warley, Tipton became part of the Sandwell Metropolitan Borough in 1974 and remains within this local authority to this day.
Tipton was once one of the most heavily industrialised towns in the Black Country.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] But most of its factories closed during the 1980s and new housing estates have been built on the site of many former factories, the new private homes have seen an upturn in Tipton's fortunes by rising house prices.

[[Plinth]]
CATEGORIES: Architectural elements, Structural engineering

In architecture, a plinth is the base or platform upon which a column, pedestal, statue, monument or structure rests. Gottfried Semper's The Four Elements of Architecture (1851) posited that the plinth, the hearth, the roof, and the wall make up all of architectural theory. The plinth usually rests directly on the ground, or "stylobate".  According to Semper, the plinth exists to negotiate between a structure and the ground. Semper's theory has been influential in the development of architecture.Mallgrave, Harry Francis. Modern Architectural Theory: A Historical Survey, 1673-1968 (Cambridge, 2005). ISBN 0-521-79306-8

The First Succession Act of Henry VIII's reign was passed by the Parliament of England in March 1534. The Act was formally titled the Succession to the Crown Act 1533 (citation 25 Hen 8 c 22), or the Act of Succession 1533; it is often dated as 1534, as it was passed in that calendar year. However, the legal calendar in use at that time dated the beginning of the year as March 25, and so considered the Act as being in 1533.
The Act made then yet unborn Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Henry VIII by Anne Boleyn, the true successor to the Crown by declaring Princess Mary, daughter of the King by Catherine of Aragon, a bastard. The Act also required all subjects, if commanded, to swear an oath to recognize this Act as well as the King's supremacy. Under the Treasons Act 1534 anyone who refused to take the oath was subject to a charge of treason.
The Act was later altered by the Second Succession Act, which made Elizabeth illegitimate, and the Third Succession Act, which returned both sisters to the line of succession.
The currently applicable legislation is the Act of Settlement 1701.

Charles Brockden Brown (January 17, 1771 – February 22, 1810), an American novelist, historian, and editor of the Early National period, is generally regarded by scholars as the most important American novelist before James Fenimore Cooper.  He is the most frequently studied and republished practitioner of the "early American novel," or the US novel between 1789 and roughly 1820.  Although Brown was by no means the first American novelist, as some early criticism claimed, the breadth and complexity of his achievement as a writer in multiple genres (novels, short stories, essays and periodical writings of every sort, poetry, historiography, reviews) makes him a crucial figure in US literature and culture of the 1790s and first decade of the 19th century, and a significant public intellectual in the wider Atlantic print culture and public sphere of the era of the French Revolution.

Christopher Anstey (31 October 1724 – 3 August 1805) was an English writer and poet.
Anstey was the son of Dr. Anstey, a wealthy clergyman, the rector of Brinkley (Cambridgeshire) where he was born.  He was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge,[tpl]acad|id=ANSY742C|name=Anstey, Christopher[/tpl] where he distinguished himself for his Latin verses. He became a fellow of his college (1745); but the degree of M.A. was withheld from him, owing to the offence caused by a speech made by him beginning: "[tpl]lang|la|Doctores sine doctrina, magistri artium sine artibus, et baccalaurei baculo potius quam lauro digni[/tpl]" (Doctors without doctrine, artless Masters of Arts, and Bachelors more worthy of the rod than the laurel).
In 1754 he succeeded to the family estates, including Anstey Hall, Trumpington and left Cambridge; and two years later he married Ann, the daughter of Felix Calvert of Albury Hall, Herts. For some time Anstey lived the life of a country squire, bringing up thirteen children, and published nothing of any note, though he cultivated letters as well as his estates. He served as High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for 1770-71.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.brlsi.org/events-proceedings/proceedings/25151| title= Christopher Anstey:A life in 18th Century Bath|publisher = Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution|accessdate = 26 June 2013[/tpl]
Some visits were made to Bath, however, where from 1770 until his death in 1805, he made No. 4 Royal Crescent his permanent home, (albeit the plaque recording this is actually displayed outside No. 5) [tpl]cite book|last=Lowndes|first=William|title=The Royal Crescent in Bath|publisher=Redcliffe Press|year=1981|isbn=978-0-905459-34-9[/tpl] where in 1766 he penned his famous rhymed letters, The New Bath Guide or Memoirs of the Blunderhead Family..., a satirical poem of considerable sparkle, about the adventures of the "Blunderhead" family in Bath, from which Tobias Smollett is said to have drawn largely in his The Expedition of Humphry Clinker.  The work had immediate success, and was enthusiastically praised for its original kind of humour by Walpole and Gray. The Election Ball, in Poetical Letters from Mr Inkle at Bath to his Wife at Gloucester (1776) sustained the reputation won by the Guide. He made many other excursions into literature which are hardly remembered, and ended his days as a country squire at the age of eighty.  His Poetical Works were collected in 1808 (2 vols.) by the author's son John Anstey (d. 1819), himself author of The Pleader's Guide (1796), in the same vein with the New Bath Guide.
Anstey was buried at St. Swithin's Church in Bath but has a white marble memorial tablet in Poets' Corner (the South Transept) of Westminster Abbey.

He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and went to London in 1723 to work as a private tutor. There he became friendly with Alexander Pope, James Thomson, and other literary figures including Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke.
His best-known work was written in the same year: William and Margaret, adapted from a traditional ballad.  In 1740, he collaborated with Thomson on a masque, Alfred, which was the vehicle for "Rule, Britannia!". His other plays and poetry (e.g. Amyntor and Theodora), popular at the time, are largely forgotten, but Bolingbroke's writings were edited and published by Mallet in 1754.

The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is a medium-sized cat native to European and Siberian forests, Central Asia and East Asia. It is also known as the European lynx, common lynx, the northern lynx, and the Siberian or Russian lynx. While its conservation status has been classified as "Least Concern", populations of Eurasian lynx have been reduced or extirpated from  western Europe, where it is now being reintroduced.

Baron Baltimore, of Baltimore Manor in County Longford, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1624 for George Calvert and became extinct on the death of the sixth Baron in 1771. The title was held by several members of the Calvert family who were proprietors of the palatinates Avalon in Newfoundland and Maryland (later the U.S. state of Maryland). In the context of United States history, the name Lord Baltimore usually refers to Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore after whom the city of Baltimore, Maryland, is named. His younger brother Leonard Calvert was the first Governor of Maryland.
As members of the Irish peerage, the Lords Baltimore were able to sit in the British House of Commons. Irish peerages were often used as a way of creating peerages which did not grant a seat in the British House of Lords and so allowed the grantee to sit in the House of Commons in London. As a consequence, many Irish peers had little or no connection to Ireland.

Poles ([tpl]lang-pl|Polacy[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pl|pɔˈlat͡sɨ|pron[/tpl]; singular masculine: Polak, singular feminine: Polka) are a nation of predominantly West Slavic ethnic origin, who are native to East-Central Europe, inhabiting mainly Poland. The present population of Poles living in Poland is estimated at 36,522,000 out of the overall Poland population of 38,512,000 (based on the census of 2011).
The preamble to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland defines the Polish nation as comprising all the citizens of Poland. Poland's inhabitants live in the following historic regions of the country: Wielkopolska, Małopolska, Mazovia ([tpl]lang-pl|Mazowsze[/tpl]), Silesia ([tpl]lang-pl|Śląsk[/tpl]), Pomerania ([tpl]lang-pl|Pomorze[/tpl]), Kujawy, Warmia, Mazury, and Podlasie. A wide-ranging Polish diaspora exists throughout Europe (Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine), the Americas (the United States, Brazil and Argentina) and Australia. In 1960, Chicago in the United States, had the world's largest urban Polish population after Warsaw."Sections of North Milwaukee Avenue are Main Street for Chicago's huge Polish population (the second-largest urban concentration after Warsaw's)" in: Chicago for Dummies by Laura Tibert 2007. p. 125; "DID YOU KNOW?

Lugo, Gerald L. Hershey, 1979 Today, the largest urban concentration of Poles is the Katowice urban agglomeration known as the Silesian Metropolis of 2.7 million inhabitants. There is a festival in Milwaukee, Wisconsin called Polish Fest and festival in Chicago, Illinois called "Polish Fest Chicago" that celebrates the Polish people.

A sharp drop in the population of its main food source, a result of two diseases, contributed to the feline's decline. The lynx was also affected by the loss of scrubland, its main habitat, to human development, including changes in land use and the construction of roads and dams.[tpl]Cite journal |journal = Animal Conservation | title = Looking for the Iberian lynx in central Spain: a needle in a hay stack? | author1 = Alda, F. et al. | year = 2008 | pages = 297–305 | volume = 11 | doi =10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00185.x | issue = 4[/tpl] 
According to the conservation group SOS Lynx, if the Iberian lynx died out, it would be the first feline species to become extinct since prehistoric times. Captive breeding and reintroduction programs have boosted their numbers. As of 2013, Andalusia has a population of 309 living in the wild. As an attempt to save this species from extinction, an EU LIFE Nature project is underway that includes habitat preservation, lynx population monitoring, and rabbit population management.[tpl]Cite journal |journal = PLOS ONE | title = Gene sets for utilization of Primary and Secondary Nutrition supplies in the Distal gut of Endangered Iberian Lynx | author1 = Alcaide, M. et al. | year = 2012 | volume = 3 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0051521 | issue = 12[/tpl]
Formerly considered a subspecies of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), the Iberian lynx is now classified as a separate species. Both species occurred together in central Europe in the Pleistocene epoch, being separated by habitat choice. The Iberian lynx is believed to have evolved from Lynx issiodorensis.

[[Ethical calculus]]

CATEGORIES: Ethics

The term ethical calculus, when used generally, refers to any method of determining a course of action in a circumstance that is not explicitly evaluated in one's ethical code.
A formal philosophy of ethical calculus is a recent development in the study of ethics, combining elements of natural selection, self-organizing systems, emergence, and algorithm theory.  Ethical calculus is based on the premise that moral and ethical codes are emergent algorithms, epiphenomena of large groups of sentient beings, and that a given moral code or ethical code behaves in organic ways, seeking to prolong itself.
According to ethical calculus, the most ethical course of action in a situation is an absolute, but rather than being based on a static ethical code, the ethical code itself is a function of circumstances.  The ideal Ethic is the course of action taken in a given situation by an omnipotent, omniscient being.  The optimal ethic is the best possible course of action taken by an individual with the given limitations.  The standard of judgment is the continuation of situations in which ethics are relevant.
While ethical calculus is, in some ways, similar to moral relativism, the former finds its grounds in the circumstance while the latter depends on social and cultural context for moral judgment.
Ethical calculus would most accurately be regarded as a form of dynamic moral absolutism.

The Common Open Policy Service (COPS) Protocol is part of the internet protocol suite as defined by the IETF's RFC 2748. COPS specifies a simple client/server model for supporting policy control over Quality of Service (QoS) signaling protocols (e.g. RSVP). Policies are stored on servers, and acted upon by Policy Decision Points (PDP), and are enforced on clients, also known as Policy Enforcement Points (PEP). There are two models of COPS: The Outsourcing Model and the Provisioning Model, considered from the view of the client or PEP.
The Outsourcing Model is the simplest COPS implementation. In this model, all policies are stored at the PDP. Whenever the PEP needs to make a decision, it sends all relevant information to the PDP. The PDP analyzes the information, makes the decision, and relays it to the PEP. The PEP then simply enforces the decision.
In the Provisioning Model, see RFC 3084 COPS Usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR), the PEP reports its decision-making capabilities to the PDP. The PDP then downloads relevant policies on to the PEP. The PEP can then make its own decisions based on these policies. The Provisioning Model uses the Policy Information Base as a repository of the policies.

[[Strata (novel)]]

Strata is a comic science fiction novel by Terry Pratchett. Published in 1981, it is one of Pratchett's first novels and one of only two purely science fiction novels he has written, the other being The Dark Side of the Sun.
Although it takes place in a different fictional universe and is more science fiction than fantasy, it could be said to be a kind of precursor to the Discworld novels, as it also features a flat Earth similar to the Discworld. It has been called a "preconsideration" of Discworld, though the plot and characters are modelled on (or parodies of) the novel Ringworld by Larry Niven.The Annotated Pratchett File v9.0 - Strata

[[Socialism in One Country]]
CATEGORIES: Communism, Marxist theory, Stalinism, Socialism

Socialism in One Country was a theory put forth by Joseph Stalin in 1924, elaborated by Nikolai Bukharin in 1925 and finally adopted by the Soviet Union as state policy. The theory held that given the defeat of all the communist revolutions in Europe in 1917–1921 except Russia's, the Soviet Union should begin to strengthen itself internally. That was a shift from the previously held Marxist position that socialism must be established globally, and was in opposition to Leon Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution.
Though promoted at the time as an ideology of necessity, not core belief, the theory came to define the course of political construction within the Soviet Union throughout its history. The theory holds that socialism can exist within a single country despite a capitalist global market operating under the law of value. 
Today the expression is typically used pejoratively by supporters of Classical Marxism, Orthodox Marxism, Left communism and Trotskyism who believe their ideology to be inherently internationalist.

[[Intent scale translation]]

CATEGORIES: Market research, Product management, Marketing, Consumer behaviour

Intent scale translation  is a mathematical technique used by marketers to convert stated purchase intentions into purchase probabilities, that is, into an estimate of actual buying behaviour.  It takes survey data on consumers purchase intentions and converts it into actual purchase probabilities.
A survey might ask a question using a five-point scale such as :

Which is most true about product X?

A marketing researcher will first assign numerical values to these intention categories. If the numbers range from zero to one, they can be thought of as intent probabilities. This is a typical example:
Next, the researcher uses a predefined functional relationship to convert the stated intentions into estimates of actual purchase probabilities. The diagram that follows illustrates one such translation function. If a survey respondent were to choose a response of “definitely” and an intent probability of .99 was assigned to that category, then the actual probability of purchase could be read off the vertical axis. The translation function gives a value of about .8, indicating the specifiers of the function feel that not all people that claim they definitely intend to purchase will actually purchase.
 alt text Intent Translation 
If a survey respondent were to choose a response of “probably not” and an intent probability of .25 was assigned to that category, then the actual probability of purchase could be read off the vertical axis as .35, indicating the specifiers of the function feel that some people that claim they probably will not purchase will actually purchase.
Other purchase intention/rating translations include logit analysis and the preference-rank translation.

The Lok Sabha ([tpl]lang-hi|लोक सभा[/tpl]) or House of the People is the lower house of the Parliament of India. Parliament of India consists of two houses: The Lok Sabha (Hindi: लोक सभा) or House of the People and the Rajya Sabha ([tpl]lang-hi|राज्य सभा[/tpl]) or Council of States. Lok means "people" and Sabha means "assembly" in Sanskrit. The Lok Sabha meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers, Sansad Bhavan, Sansad Marg, New Delhi.
Lok Sabha is composed of representatives of the people from 543 constituencies, chosen by direct election on the basis of adult suffrage. A total of 131 seats (18.42%) are reserved for representatives of Scheduled Castes(84) and  Scheduled Tribes(47) only. The maximum strength of the House envisaged by the Constitution of India is 552, which is made up by election of up to 530 members to represent the States, up to 20 members to represent the Union Territories and not more than two members of the Anglo-Indian Community to be nominated by the President of India, if, in his/her opinion, that community is not adequately represented in the House. The total elective membership is distributed among the States in such a way that the ratio between the number of seats allotted to each State and the population of the State is, so far as practicable, the same for all States.Parliament of India: Lok SabhaPart V—The Union. Article 81. p39
Lok Sabha, unless sooner dissolved, continues for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and the expiration of the period of five years operates as dissolution of the House.

[[Tape loop]]
CATEGORIES: Electronic music

In music, tape loops are loops of prerecorded magnetic tape used to create repetitive, rhythmic musical patterns or dense layers of sound. Contemporary composers such as Halim El-Dabh, Steve Reich, and Karlheinz Stockhausen used tape loops to create phase patterns and rhythms. Terry Riley originally employed the technique of tape looping in the 1950s; later producing such pieces as "Music For the Gift" (1963) and "Bird of Paradise" (1964) and culminating in his use of two tape recorders (collectively described by Riley as the "Time Lag Accumulator") in live solo performances to create long delays, during which he would play both saxophone and organ, as heard on the album Reed Streams (1966) and the piece "Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band" (on the 1969 album A Rainbow in Curved Air). In 1973, musicians Brian Eno and Robert Fripp used an entirely similar idea to make the album No Pussyfooting; Robert Fripp later coining the term "Frippertronics" to describe this process pioneered by Terry Riley. In the mid-1980s, digital sampling overtook much tape loop use. In the 1990s and 2000s, digital looping pedals became more affordable. One-man bands use looping pedals to record a groove or riff, and then they solo over the riff as it repeats.

Binghamton University, or Binghamton University, State University of New York, commonly referred to as BU, is a public research university in the U.S. state of New York. The university is one of the four university centers in the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Since its establishment in 1946, the university has grown from a small liberal arts college, Harpur College, to a large doctoral-granting institution, presently consisting of six colleges and schools, and is now home to more than 16,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The legal and official name of the university is the State University of New York at Binghamton.[tpl]cite  web|url=http://bingdev.binghamton.edu/administration/procedures/500series/502.htm|title=BU Administration Procedures|publisher=SUNY Binghamton|accessdate=2010-10-17[/tpl]
Binghamton University is currently ranked 97th among the 281 national universities ranked in the 2014 U.S. News America's Best Colleges and Universities ranking and has been called a "Public Ivy".

[[Culture of Guyana]]

CATEGORIES: Guyanese culture

Guyanese culture reflects the influence of African, Indian, Amerindian, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch and British cultures.Ali, Arif (ed). Guyana. London: Hansib, 2008Smock, Kirk. Guyana: the Bradt Travel Guide. 2007.
Guyana is one of a few mainland territories of South America that is considered to be a part of the Caribbean region. Guyanese culture shares many commonalities with the cultures of islands in the West Indies, particularly in the coastal regions of the country (where the majority of the population is concentrated).  In the last few decades with the opening of the interior and a highway into Brazil there have been a movement of people and the influence of Brazilian culture, in the south of the country. Because Guyana was once a British colony, there are many cultural influences that live on, particularly in the use of language, where British terms are used, some dating back to the 17th century. The country is also still riddled with Dutch place names from when the country was various separate Dutch colonies.

[[Palliative care]]

CATEGORIES: Palliative medicine, Palliative care, Hospice

Palliative care (also called palliative medicine) is an area of healthcare that focuses on relieving and preventing the suffering of patients. Unlike hospice care, palliative care is appropriate for patients in all disease stages, including those undergoing treatment for curable illnesses and those living with chronic diseases, as well as patients who are nearing the end of life. Palliative medicine utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, relying on input from physicians, pharmacists, nurses, chaplains, social workers, psychologists and other allied health professionals in formulating a plan of care to relieve suffering in all areas of a patient's life. This multidisciplinary approach allows the palliative care team to address physical, emotional, spiritual and social concerns that arise with advanced illness.
Medications and treatments are said to have a palliative effect if they relieve symptoms without having a curative effect on the underlying disease or cause. This can include treating nausea related to chemotherapy or something as simple as morphine to treat the pain of broken leg or ibuprofen to treat aching related to an influenza (flu) infection.
Although the concept of palliative care is not new, most physicians have traditionally concentrated on trying to cure patients. Treatments for the alleviation of symptoms were viewed as hazardous and seen as inviting addiction and other unwanted side effects.[tpl]cite journal |first= J. E |last= Seymour |coauthors= D.

Beer pong, also known as Beirut, is a drinking game in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of beer on the other end.

Mont Saint-Michel ([tpl]IPA-fr|mɔ̃ sɛ̃ mi.ʃɛl|pron[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-en|link=no|Saint Michael's Mount[/tpl]) is an island commune in Normandy, France. It is located approximately one kilometre ([tpl]convert|1|km|1|abbr=off|disp=output only[/tpl]) off the country's northwestern coast, at the mouth of the Couesnon River near Avranches. [tpl]convert|100|ha|0[/tpl] in size, the island has a population of 44 (2009).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/recensement/populations-legales/commune.asp?annee=2009&depcom=50353 |title=Insee – Populations légales 2009 – 50353-Le Mont-Saint-Michel |first= |last=|work=insee.fr |year=2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl]
The island has held strategic fortifications since ancient times, and since the eighth century AD has been the seat of the monastery from which it draws its name. The structural composition of the town exemplifies the feudal society that constructed it. On top God, the abbey and monastery, below this the Great halls, then stores and housing, and at the bottom, outside the walls, fishermen and farmers' housing.
Its unique position of being an island only 600 metres from land made it readily accessible on low tide to the many pilgrims to its abbey. Equally, this position made it readily defensible as an incoming tide stranded, or drowned, would-be assailants. By capitalising on this natural defence, the Mont remained unconquered during the Hundred Years' War with a small garrison successfully defending it against a full attack by the English in 1433.http://xenophongroup.com/montjoie/st-mont.htm The reverse benefits of its natural defence was not lost on Louis XI who turned The Mont into a state prison and thereafter the abbey started to be used more regularly as a jail during the Ancien Régime from the sixteenth century.

The Matterhorn (German), Monte Cervino (Italian) or Mont Cervin (French), is a mountain in the Pennine Alps on the border between Switzerland and Italy. Its summit is [tpl]convert|4478|m|ft|0[/tpl] high, making it one of the highest peaks in the Alps.Considering summits with at least 300 metres prominence, it is the 6th highest in the Alps. The four steep faces, rising above the surrounding glaciers, face the four compass points. The mountain overlooks the town of Zermatt in the canton of Valais to the north-east and Breuil-Cervinia in the Aosta Valley to the south.  Theodul Pass, located at the eastern base of the peak, is the lowest passage between its north and south side.
The Matterhorn was one of the last great Alpine peaks to be climbed and its first ascent marked the end of the golden age of alpinism.[tpl]cite book|last=Messner|first=Reinhold|title=The big walls: from the North Face of the Eiger to the South Face of Dhaulagiri|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zAsmC9vn6oIC|accessdate=13 July 2011|date=September 2001|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|isbn=978-0-89886-844-9|page=46[/tpl] It was made in 1865 by a party led by Edward Whymper and ended disastrously when four of its members fell to their deaths on the descent. The north face was not climbed until 1931, and is amongst the six great north faces of the Alps. It is estimated that over 500 alpinists have died on the Matterhorn since the first climb in 1865, making it one of the deadliest peaks in the Alps.Journal de Genève, 10-28-1995, p. 23
The Matterhorn has become an iconic emblem of the Swiss Alps and the Alps in general. Since the end of the 19th century, when railways were built, it attracted more and more visitors and climbers. Each summer a large number of mountaineers try to climb the Matterhorn via the northeast Hörnli ridge, the most popular route to the summit.

[[Preference-rank translation]]
CATEGORIES: Choice modelling, Consumer behaviour, Market research, Product management, Marketing

Preference-rank translation  is a mathematical technique used by marketers to convert stated preferences into purchase probabilities, that is, into an estimate of actual buying behaviour.  It takes survey data on consumers’ preferences and converts it into actual purchase probabilities.
A survey might ask a question using a ranking scale such as :
Please rate the following products from 1 (most preferred) to 5 (least preferred).
A marketing researcher will re-specify the numerical values during codification. 1 will become 5, 2 will become 4,  4 will become 2, 5 will become 1, and 3 will remain the same. In this way greater values will correspond with greater preference. 
Next, the researcher uses a data reduction technique like factor analysis to obtain aggregate  scores. To convert these aggregate rankings into purchase probabilities, each category (in this case, each product) will be weighted with a translation coefficient. These weights are predefined. 
A typical weighting scheme is:

first choice = 75% 
second choice = 17% 
third choice = 6% 
fourth choice = 2% 
fifth choice = 0%
The weighting schemes vary depending on the variables being measured.
The following chart illustrates the procedure:
Other purchase intention/rating translations include logit analysis and the intent scale translation.

[[Independent sideband]]
CATEGORIES: Radio modulation modes

Independent sideband (ISB) is an AM single sideband mode which is used with some AM radio transmissions.  Normally each sideband carries identical information, but ISB modulates two different input signals — one on the upper sideband, the other on the lower sideband.  This is used in some kinds of AM stereo (sometimes known as the Kahn system), but is generally otherwise prohibited in the U.S. by the FCC.
ISB is a compromise between double sideband (DSB) and single sideband (SSB) — the other is vestigial sideband (VSB).  If the sidebands are out of phase with each other, then phase modulation (PM) of the carrier occurs.  AM and PM together then create quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).  ISB may or may not have the carrier suppressed.
Suppressed-carrier ISB was employed in point-to-point (usually overseas) radiotelephony and radioteletype by shortwave (HF). In military use, ISB usually referred to a close pair of FSK radioteletype channels which could be demodulated by a single receiver, and employed in fleet broadcast, point-to-point, and between larger vessels and shore stations on HF and UHF.

Rebecca Clarke (27 August 1886 – 13 October 1979) was an English classical composer and violist best known for her chamber music featuring the viola. She was born in Harrow and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Music in London, later becoming one of the first female professional orchestral players. Stranded in the United States at the outbreak of World War II, she settled permanently in New York City and married composer and pianist James Friskin in 1944. Clarke died at her home in New York at the age of 93.
Although Clarke wrote little, due in part to her ideas about the role of a female composer, her work was recognised for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.

Its aim is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the following freedom rights: users are free to run the software, share it (copy, distribute), study it and modify it. GNU software guarantees these freedom-rights legally (via its license), and is therefore free software; the use of the word "free" always being taken to refer to freedom.
In order to ensure that the entire software of a computer grants its users all freedom rights (use, share, study, modify), even the most fundamental and important part, the operating system (including all its numerous utility programs), needed to be written. The founding goal of the project was, in the words of its initial announcement, to develop "a sufficient body of free software ... to get along without any software that is not free."[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html |title=The GNU Manifesto |date=21 July 2007 |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2007-11-10[/tpl]  Stallman decided to call this operating system GNU (a recursive acronym meaning "GNU's not Unix"), basing its design on that of Unix; however, in contrast to Unix which was proprietary software, GNU was to be freedom-respecting software (free software) that users can use, share, study and modify. Development was initiated in January, 1984. The goal of making a completely free software operating system was achieved in 1992 when the third-party Linux kernel was released as free software, under version 2 of the GNU General Public License, to be used with the GNU software stack.
The project's current work includes software development, awareness building, political campaigning and sharing of the new material.

The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), also known as the dama wallaby or darma wallaby, is a small macropod native to South and Western Australia. Though its geographical range has been severely reduced since European colonisation, the tammar remains common within its reduced range and it is listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It has been introduced to New Zealand and reintroduced to some areas of Australia where it had been previously eradicated. Skull differences distinguish tammars from Western Australia, Kangaroo Island and mainland South Australia, making them distinct populations groups or possibly different subspecies.
Around the size of a rabbit, the tammar is among the smallest of the wallabies. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrub. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.

CATEGORIES: 1927 births, Living people, American magicians, American comedy writers

Robert Orben (born March 4, 1927) is best known as an American professional comedy writer, though he also worked as a speechwriter for Gerald R. Ford and as a magician. He has written multiple books on comedy, mostly collections of gags and "one-liners" originally written for his newsletter, Orben's Current Comedy, and he has also written books for magicians.
Robert Orben published his first gag book at the age of 18 in 1946, when he was working in Stuart Robson Jr.'s (stage manager for Florenz Ziegfeld) conjuror's shop in New York.  Professional magicians would use his gags to add humor to their acts; comedians also came into magic stores, for props and books, as there were no comedy stores or resources as such at that time.
When Robert Orben wrote his first gag book, Encyclopedia of Patter, it proved very popular, and he started publishing more books of gags, complete with sketches, ad libs, bits of business and routines. Titles included Patter Parade, Laugh Package, Sight Bits, and Screamline Comedy.
By the 1950s, Orben gag books were ubiquitous in the comedy profession and were probably overused by stand-up comedians.  Orben has said he nearly sued Lenny Bruce once, as Bruce advertised his show with the tag line, "No Joe Miller, no corn, no Orben".  However, Orben never sued, and only saw Bruce perform once, shortly before Bruce's death.
In addition to his gag and humor books, he started publishing a regular newsletter of topical humor, Orben's Current Comedy, which he wrote for nearly 30 years, stopping in 1989.  Other comedy writers, including Gary Apple and Daniel R. White, attempted to keep the newsletter going, under the name Current Comedy, but none were able to halt the decline of subscriptions, and eventually the rights to it were sold.
As Orben's books began to attract attention, he started writing custom-made gags for comedian Dick Gregory for six years.  Gregory had contacted him in 1955, when Gregory was starting out in Chicago.  Orben told him to get in touch when he'd found his own comedic voice.  In 1962, Gregory telegrammed Orben, saying there would be a two-page article in Time about him.  Orben bought the magazine and saw the article, and shortly after, the two signed a contract to work together.  Orben also wrote for Jack Paar on The Tonight Show in New York (1962–63), and the Red Skelton Show in Hollywood (1964–70).
Later, Orben moved into politics, and in 1973 he became head speechwriter to Vice President Gerald R. Ford.[tpl]cite book |last=Wickberg |first=Daniel |authorlink= |title=The Senses of Humor: Self and Laughter in Modern America |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1998 |pages=197 |isbn=0-8014-3078-X[/tpl]  When Ford succeeded to the Presidency in August, 1974, Orben became his speechwriter.  In January 1976 he was appointed Special Assistant to President Ford and Director of the White House Speechwriting Department.
As of 2007, Orben works as a speaker for corporate events.  His most recent book is Speaker's Handbook of Humor.

Khachaturian's original Gayane was the story of a young Armenian woman whose patriotic convictions conflict with her personal feelings on discovering her husband's treason. In later years, the plot was modified several times, the resultant story emphasizing romance over nationalistic zeal.

Borlaug received his B.Sc. Biology 1937 and  Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties.
During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations.Borlaug, father of ‘Green Revolution’, dead These collective increases in yield have been labeled the Green Revolution, and Borlaug is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.The phrase "over a billion lives saved" is often cited by others in reference to Norman Borlaug's work (e.g., http://agriculture.senate.gov/Hearings/hearings.cfm?hearingid=1523&witnessId=4333). According to Jan Douglas here, Executive Assistant to the World Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article "Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity", the article states that the "form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths."

The Jungfrau (German: "maiden/virgin") is one of the main summits in the Bernese Alps, situated between the cantons of Valais and Bern in Switzerland. Together with the Eiger and Mönch, the Jungfrau forms a massive wall overlooking the Bernese Oberland and is considered one of the most emblematic sights of the Swiss Alps.
The summit was first reached on August 3, 1811 by the Meyer brothers of Aarau and two chamois hunters from Valais. The ascent followed a long expedition over the glaciers and high passes of the Bernese Alps. It was not until 1865 that a more direct route on the northern side was opened.
The construction of the Jungfraujoch railway east of the summit in the early 20th century made the area one of the most-visited places in the Alps. Along with the Aletsch Glacier to the south, the Jungfrau is part of the Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area, which was declared a World Heritage Site in  2001.

[[Tornado warning]]

CATEGORIES: Tornado, Weather warnings and advisories

A tornado warning (SAME code: TOR) is an alert issued by weather services to warn that severe thunderstorms with tornadoes may be imminent. It can be issued after a tornado or funnel cloud has been spotted by the public, storm chasers, emergency management or law enforcement, or more commonly if there are radar indications of tornado formation. When this happens, the tornado sirens may sound in that area if any sirens are present, informing people that a tornado has been sighted or is forming nearby. The issuance of a tornado warning indicates that residents should take immediate safety precautions. It is a higher level of alert than a tornado watch, but (in the United States) it can be surpassed by an even higher alert known as a tornado emergency.

[[Tornado watch]]
CATEGORIES: Weather warnings and advisories, Tornado

A tornado watch (code: WT; sometimes referred to as a "red box" by meteorologists and storm chasers) is issued when weather conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms that are capable of producing tornadoes. A tornado watch therefore implies that it is also a severe thunderstorm watch. A tornado watch must not be confused with a tornado warning. In most cases, the potential exists for large hail and/or damaging winds in addition to tornadoes.
A watch does not mean that the severe weather is actually occurring, only that atmospheric conditions have created a significant risk for it. If severe weather actually does occur, a tornado warning or severe thunderstorm warning would then be issued. Note that a watch is not required for a warning to be issued; tornado warnings are occasionally issued when a tornado watch is not active (i.e. when a severe thunderstorm watch is active, or when no watches are in effect), if a severe thunderstorm develops and has a confirmed tornado or strong rotation.
In the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (a national guidance center of the National Weather Service) issues watches for areas likely to produce tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. The watch boxes (or weather watches, WWs) are usually issued in the format of x miles north and south, or east and west, or either side of a line from y miles direction of city, state, to z miles another direction of another city, state. For example: "50 miles either side of a line from 10 miles northeast of Columbia, South Carolina to 15 miles south-southwest of Montgomery, Alabama" ("Either side" means perpendicular to the center line). In addition, a list of all counties included in its area of responsibility is now issued by each NWS forecast office for each watch.
In the event that a tornado watch is likely to lead to a major tornado outbreak along with possible destructive winds and hail, enhanced wording with the words Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) can be added to the watch; this is occasionally issued. Occasionally, a tornado watch may replace a severe thunderstorm watch (or a portion of one) should conditions that were originally forecast to be conducive for non-tornadic severe thunderstorms change to allow possible tornado formation.
In Canada, the criteria used to issue a tornado watch is the same and watches are issued by regional offices of the Meteorological Service of Canada of Environment Canada in Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax, on a county or regional basis.
The term "red box" refers to the assigned coloring used for watch box outlines used in Storm Prediction Center and National Weather Service products; television stations typically assign other colors (usually green) to highlight tornado watches in severe weather advisory displays.

[tpl]col-end[/tpl]]]
A severe thunderstorm watch (SAME code: SVA; sometimes referred to as "blue box" or "yellow box" by meteorologists and storm chasers) is issued when weather conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms. If thunderstorms are expected to be of sufficient strength such that there is a significant risk that they may produce tornadoes, then a tornado watch (which also automatically implies that severe thunderstorms are possible) is issued. A severe thunderstorm watch can also be upgraded to a tornado watch if conditions originally forecasted for limited to no tornadic development change to allow possible tornado formation (in which case the existing severe thunderstorm watch, or a portion of it, would be replaced). A watch must not be confused with a severe thunderstorm warning.
A watch does not necessarily mean that severe weather is actually occurring, only that atmospheric conditions have created a significant risk for severe weather to occur. If severe weather actually does occur, a severe thunderstorm warning or tornado warning will be issued, and urgent action should be taken immediately. While a severe thunderstorm watch does not imply in its name the risk for tornadoes, the risk for tornadoes in such a scenario is not necessarily zero as severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do spawn tornadoes even after only a severe thunderstorm watch has been issued.
In the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (a national guidance center of the National Weather Service (NWS)) issues watches for areas of the lower 48 states that are likely to produce tornadoes and/or severe thunderstorms. The local NWS forecast offices in Hawaii and Alaska issue their own Severe Thunderstorm and Tornado Watches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp3.pdf|title=3.2.1.1 Geographical responsibilities|accessdate=3 January 2013[/tpl] 
The terms "blue box" and "yellow box" refer to the assigned coloring used for watch box outlines used in Storm Prediction Center and National Weather Service products as well as by television broadcast media (in the case of the latter, blue is typically assigned to highlight severe thunderstorm watches whereas yellow is often assigned to severe thunderstorm warnings).
The watch boxes (or weather watches, WWs) are usually issued in the format of x miles north and south, or east and west, or either side of a line from y miles direction of city, state, to z miles another direction of another city, state. For example: "50 miles either side of a line from 10 miles northeast of Columbia, South Carolina to 15 miles south-southwest of Montgomery, Alabama". ("Either side" means perpendicular to the center line.) When displayed on a map, they are usually shown as either a blue or yellow outline, depending on the source. In addition, a list of all counties included in its area of responsibility is now issued by each local NWS forecast office for each watch.
In the event that a Severe Thunderstorm Watch is likely to lead to very destructive winds or hail (usually from a major derecho event), enhanced wording with the words Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) can be added to the watch. This is rare with Severe Thunderstorm Watches, since the tornado threat has to remain low enough to only warrant a Severe Thunderstorm Watch and a higher tornado threat would warrant a normal Tornado Watch despite the extreme wind or hail threat. It is far more common with Tornado Watches.
Similar watches and warnings are issued by Environment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=B8CD636F-1&def=show01F2C0E3E#1F2C0E3E|title=Severe Thunderstorm Watch|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=D9553AB5-1#severethunderstorm|title=Severe Thunderstorm|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl] from their offices in Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

[[Openlab]]

CATEGORIES: Image processing software

Openlab is a software package for performing 2D microscope image processing and integrating and controlling a diverse array of instrumentation in a laboratory environment. It consists of a core application which can manage large arrays of image data, and a series of separate plug-in modules which implement a variety of tasks according to the needs of the end user. The customer is able to tailor the system to exactly their own requirements, but use a coherent GUI to operate the entire system.
The software suite has four basic areas of operation – acquisition, image presentation, and storage, analysis, and automation. Most types of microscope and camera are supported for acquiring images, which are then available to the rest of the system in a common format. A number of deconvolution algorithms are available to dramatically improve image quality. Analysis involves extracting data into the package's own spreadsheet-like interface, or exporting raw measurements to external software.
Openlab can control a large number of devices found in the typical laboratory, as well as the microscope itself – focus drives, XY Stages, optical filters, drug-delivery systems, etc. The package provides for manual control of all of these items through its GUI, or using its automator, a built in graphical programming language.

[[Deconvolution]]

CATEGORIES: Signal processing, Image processing

In mathematics, deconvolution is an algorithm-based process used to reverse the effects of convolution on recorded data.[tpl]cite web | author = O'Haver T | title = Intro to Signal Processing - Deconvolution | url = http://www.wam.umd.edu/~toh/spectrum/Deconvolution.html | publisher = University of Maryland at College Park | accessdate = 2007-08-15[/tpl] The concept of deconvolution is widely used in the techniques of signal processing and image processing.  Because these techniques are in turn widely used in many scientific and engineering disciplines, deconvolution finds many applications.
In general, the object of deconvolution is to find the solution of a convolution equation of the form:
Usually, h is some recorded signal, and ƒ is some signal that we wish to recover, but has been convolved with some other signal g before we recorded it.  The function g might represent the transfer function of an instrument or a driving force that was applied to a physical system.  If we know g, or at least know the form of g, then we can perform deterministic deconvolution.  However, if we do not know g in advance, then we need to estimate it.  This is most often done using methods of statistical estimation.
In physical measurements, the situation is usually closer to
In this case ε is noise that has entered our recorded signal.  If we assume that a noisy signal or image is noiseless when we try to make a statistical estimate of g, our estimate will be incorrect.  In turn, our estimate of ƒ will also be incorrect.  The lower the signal-to-noise ratio, the worse our estimate of the deconvolved signal will be. That is the reason why inverse filtering the signal is usually not a good solution. However, if we have at least some knowledge of the type of noise in the data (for example, white noise), we may be able to improve the estimate of ƒ through techniques such as Wiener deconvolution.
The foundations for deconvolution and time-series analysis were largely laid by Norbert Wiener of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his book Extrapolation, Interpolation, and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series (1949).[tpl]cite book |author=Wiener N |title=Extrapolation, Interpolation, and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1964 |isbn=0-262-73005-7[/tpl]  The book was based on work Wiener had done during World War II but that had been classified at the time.  Some of the early attempts to apply these theories were in the fields of weather forecasting and economics.

[[Shared nothing architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Data partitioning, Distributed computing architecture, Software architecture

A shared nothing architecture (SN) is a distributed computing architecture in which each node is independent and self-sufficient, and there is no single point of contention across the system. More specifically, none of the nodes share memory or disk storage.
People typically contrast SN with systems that keep a large amount of centrally-stored state information, whether in a database, an application server, or any other similar single point of contention. While SN is best known in the context of web development, the concept predates the web: Michael Stonebraker at the University of California, Berkeley used the term in a 1986 database paper.The Case for Shared Nothing Architecture by Michael Stonebraker. published in Database Engineering, Volume 9, Number 1 (1986).(PDF) In it he mentions existing commercial implementations of the architecture (although none are named explicitly).   Teradata,  which delivered its first system in 1983, was probably one of those commercial implementations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teradata.com/t/history/ |title=Teradata History |publisher=Teradata.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl] Tandem Computers officially released NonStop SQL, a shared nothing database, in 1984.NonStop SQL, A Distributed, High-Performance, High-Availability Implementation of SQL, Tandem Technical Report TR-87.4, http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/tandem/TR-87.4.pdf
Shared nothing is popular for web development because of its scalability. As Google has demonstrated, a pure SN system can scale almost infinitely simply by adding nodes in the form of inexpensive computers, since there is no single bottleneck to slow the system down.[ref]
</ref> Google calls this ''[[sharding]]''. A SN system typically partitions its data among many nodes on different databases (assigning different computers to deal with different users or queries), or may require every node to maintain its own copy of the application's data, using some kind of coordination protocol. This is often referred to as ''database sharding''.
There is some doubt about whether a web application with many independent web nodes but a single, shared database (clustered or otherwise) should be counted as SN. One of the approaches to achieve SN architecture for stateful applications (which typically maintain state in a centralized database) is the use of a data grid, also known as distributed caching. This still leaves the centralized database as a single point of failure.
Shared nothing architectures have become prevalent in the data warehousing space. There is much debate as to whether the shared nothing approach is superior to shared DiskIndependent article comparing Shared Nothing and Shared Disk with sound arguments presented by both camps. Shared nothing architectures certainly take longer to respond to queries that involve joins over large data sets from different partitions (machines). However the potential for scaling is huge.Article on Shared Nothing from the point of view of a Shared Nothing Vendor(PDF)

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Federal waterways in Germany

The Peene ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈpeːnə[/tpl]) is a river in Germany. The Westpeene, Kleine Peene and Ostpeene flow into the Kummerower See, and from there as Peene proper to Anklam and into the Oder Lagoon.
The Peene Valley is the largest contiguous fen region in Europe.Peenetal / Peene-Haff-Moor at www.bfn.de. Thanks to its wilderness and intact nature, the river Peene and its valley is often referred to as "the Amazon of the North".Peene: Paddeln auf dem Amazonas des Nordens (Spiegel Online)
The western branch of the Oder River, which separates the island of Usedom from the German mainland, is often also called Peene, but actually is considered a part of the Baltic Sea called Peenestrom. It is one of three channels connecting the Oder Lagoon with the Bay of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea (the other channels being the Świna and the Dziwna).
Major towns at the Peene river are Wolgast, Teterow, Demmin and Anklam.

[[List of electronic music genres]]
CATEGORIES: Electronic music genres, Lists of music genres

This is a list of electronic music genres, consisting of genres of electronic music, primarily created with electronic musical instruments or electronic music technology. A distinction has been made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology.T. B. Holmes, Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition (London: Routledge, 2nd ed., 2002), ISBN 0-415-93643-8, p. 6. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the Theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.T. B. Holmes, Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition (London: Routledge, 2nd ed., 2002), ISBN 0-415-93643-8, p. 8.
In its early development electronic music was associated almost exclusively with Western art music, but from the late 1960s on the availability of affordable music technology, particularly of synthesisers, meant that music produced using electronic means became increasingly common in the popular domain of rock and pop music, resulting in major electronically based sub-genres.T. B. Holmes, Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition (London: Routledge, 2nd ed., 2002), ISBN 0-415-93643-8, p. 1. After the definition of MIDI in 1982 and the development of digital audio, the creation of purely electronic sounds and their manipulation became much simpler.[tpl]Citation |author=M.

In the new millennium, as computer technology became even more accessible and music software advanced, interacting with music production technology made it possible to create music that has no relationship to traditional musical performance practices, leading to further developments and rapidly evolving sub-genres.S.

CATEGORIES: 2002 novels, Novels by Nick Hornby, Viking Press books

How to Be Good is a 2001 novel by the English writer Nick Hornby.  It centers on characters Katie Carr, a doctor, and her husband, David Grant.  The story begins when David stops being "The Angriest Man In Holloway" and begins to be "good" with the help of his spiritual healer, DJ GoodNews (who also shows up briefly in Hornby's A Long Way Down). The pair go about this by nominally convincing people to give their spare bedrooms to the homeless, but as their next scheme comes around, "reversal" (being good to people one has been not good to in the past), this proves to be fruitless and thus David gives up his strivings and his plans for a book on how to be good, appropriately named "How to be Good."
The protagonist, Katie, briefly encounters a minor character named Dick whose description and attitude towards music are reminiscent of the character of the same name from Hornby's second novel, High Fidelity.

Caveat emptor [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|v|iː|ɑː|t|_|ˈ|ɛ|m|p|t|ɔr[/tpl] is Latin for "Let the buyer beware"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Caveat%20emptor |title=Caveat emptor - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2008-03-30 |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated [/tpl] 
(from caveat, "may he beware", the subjunctive of cavere, "to beware" + emptor, "buyer").
Generally, caveat emptor is the contract law principle that controls the sale of real property after the date of closing, but may also apply to sales of other goods.
The phrase caveat emptor arises from the fact that buyers often have less information about the good or service they are purchasing, while the seller has more information. Defects in the good or service may be hidden from the buyer, and only known to the seller. Thus, the buyer should beware. This is called information asymmetry.

Marsaxlokk is a traditional fishing village located in the south-eastern part of Malta, with a population of 3,277 people (NSO Report, Dec 2008). The village’s name comes from marsa, which means "port" and xlokk, which is the local name for south east. The word is related to the name for the dry sirocco wind that blows from the Sahara, comparable to the equivalent Catalan word, "xaloc". During the week days Marsaxlokk is full of souvenirs hawkers selling traditional souvenirs to the tourists. The Marsaxlokk Market has a long history. The market took place even before the sea side restaurants who sell delicious food especially the fish.On a Sunday, a very big market takes place around the whole village with many selling vegetables, clothes, and spectacular fish. The inhabitants of the village are namely called as the Xlukkajri and many of them are fishermen, although today their children are heading and succeeding at school. Interesting is also the fact that the Xlukkajri have their very own dialect which is practiced by many.

[[Digital Radio Mondiale]]

CATEGORIES: Digital radio, International broadcasting, Open standards, Radio hobbies

Digital Radio Mondiale (abbreviated DRM; mondiale being Italian and French for "worldwide") is a set of digital audio broadcasting technologies designed to work over the bands currently used for AM broadcasting, particularly shortwave. DRM can fit more channels than AM, at higher quality, into a given amount of bandwidth, using various MPEG-4 codecs.
Digital Radio Mondiale is also the name of the international non-profit consortium designing and implementing the platform. Radio France Internationale, TéléDiffusion de France, BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle, Voice of America, Telefunken (now Transradio) and Thomcast (now Technicolor SA) took part at the formation of the DRM consortium.
The principle of DRM is that bandwidth is the limited element, and computer processing power is cheap; modern CPU-intensive audio compression techniques enable more efficient use of available bandwidth, at the expense of processing resources.

[[Resolution (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Consonance and dissonance

Resolution in western tonal music theory is the move of a note or chord from dissonance (an unstable sound) to a consonance (a more final or stable sounding one). 
Dissonance, resolution, and suspense can be used to create musical interest. Where a melody or chordal pattern is expected to resolve to a certain note or chord, a different but similarly suitable note can be resolved to instead, creating an interesting and unexpected sound. For example, the deceptive cadence.

Digital radio has several related meanings:
1. Today the most common meaning is digital radio broadcasting technologies. In these systems, the analog audio signal is digitized, compressed using formats such as mp2, and transmitted using a digital modulation scheme. The aim is to increase the number of radio programs in a given spectrum, to improve the audio quality, to eliminate fading problems in mobile environments, to allow additional datacasting services, and to decrease the transmission power or the number of transmitters required to cover a region. However, analog radio (AM and FM) is still more popular and listening to radio over IP is growing in popularity.
In 2012 there are four digital wireless radio systems recognized by the International Telecommunications Union: the two European systems Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), the Japanese ISDB-T and the U.S. or Arab World HD-Radio (IBOC).
2. An older definition, still used in communication engineering literature, is wireless digital transmission technologies, i.e. microwave  and radio frequency communication standards where analog information signals as well as digital data are carried by a digital signal, by means of a digital modulation method. This definition includes broadcasting systems such at digital TV and digital radio broadcasting, but also two-way digital radio standards such as the second generation (2G) cell-phones and later, short-range communication such as digital cordless phones, wireless computer networks, digital micro-wave radio links, deep space communication systems such as communications to and from the two Voyager space probes, etcetera.
3. A less common definition is radio receiver and transmitter implementations that are based on digital signal processing, but may transmit or receive analog radio transmission standards, for example FM radio. This may reduce noise and distortion induced in the electronics.  It also allows software radio implementations, where the transmission technology is changed just by selecting another piece of software.  In most cases, this would however increase the energy consumption of the receiver equipment[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl].

CATEGORIES: Sailing rigs and rigging, Fasteners

A shackle, also known as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with a clevis pin or bolt across the opening, or a hinged metal loop secured with a quick-release locking pin mechanism. The term also applies to handcuffs and other similarly conceived restraint devices that function in a similar manner. Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks.
A carabiner is a variety of shackle used in mountaineering.

[[Megavoltage X-rays]]
CATEGORIES: Radiation therapy, X-rays

Megavoltage X-rays are produced by linear accelerators ("linacs") operating at voltages in excess of 1000 kV (1 MV) range, and therefore have an energy in the MeV range (see external beam radiotherapy for an explanation of the maximum and mean energies as a function of voltage). Beams with the voltage range of 4-25 MV are used to treat patients because radiation oncologists find that they penetrate well to deep sites within the body.Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. "Principles of Radiation Therapy" in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach. 11 ed. 2008.
For instance, in one particular technique of prostate radiotherapy, a patient will be treated with 5 radiation beams of 15 MV X-rays. While the beams will point into the patient from different angles, all the beams will be pointed towards one point or centre in the prostate (so called an isocentric technique). In this way the linac can rotate around the patient who does not need to move. In fact, patient motion is a source of positioning error which a radiation therapist tries to eliminate.
By crossing multiple beams, the radiation dose delivered internally in the prostate is much higher (~70-78 Gy) than the radiation dose delivered on the entry and exit tracks of each individual beam (~40 Gy). This lower dose outside the prostate rarely leads to side effects or any detectable change.
By convention, the voltage is used to characterize X- and gamma-ray beams (in volts), whilst electron beams are characterized by their energies (in electronvolts).

[[Radiation therapist]]

CATEGORIES: Healthcare occupations

The Radiation Therapist (or Therapeutic Radiographer (esp. UK), or Radiotherapist) is an allied health professional who works in the field of radiation oncology. Radiation therapists plan and administer radiation treatments to cancer patients in most Western countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, most European countries, and Canada where the minimum education requirement is often a baccalaureate degree or postgraduate degrees in Radiation Therapy.  Radiation therapists (with Master's and Doctoral degrees) can also prescribe medications and radiation, interpret tests results, perform follow ups, reviews, and provide consultations to cancer patients in the United Kingdom and Ontario, Canada (possibly in Australia in the future as well).
In the United States, radiation therapists have a lower educational requirement (minimum an associate degree of arts even though many graduate with bachelor's degrees) and often require postgraduate education and certification (CMD, Certified Medical Dosimetrist) in order to plan treatments.

The Treaty of Paris, signed on January 6, 1810, ended the war between France and Sweden after Sweden's defeat by Russia, an ally of France, in the Finnish War of 1808-1809.  Russia had previously been an ally of Sweden in the Third and Fourth Coalitions against France, but after Russia's defeat at Friedland, she joined France and attacked Sweden so as to compel her to join Napoleon's Continental System.  Indeed, the primary result of the treaty was Sweden's agreement to join the Continental System, so that Sweden would not trade with the UK.Durant, Will. The Age of Napoleon. New York: MJF Books, 1975. pg. 236.  Shortly after the treaty was signed, on August 21, 1810, one of Napoleon's marshals, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, was elected crown prince of Sweden, and he went on to found the House of Bernadotte, which remains the Royal House of Sweden.  The peace resulting from the treaty lasted until Napoleon's refusal to permit Sweden to annex Norway, which was then under the sovereignty of Denmark, an ally of France.Durant, pg. 663.  This was followed in January 1812 by French occupation of Swedish Pomerania for violation of the Continental System, since Sweden was still trading with the UK, and, in April, Sweden's conclusion of the Treaty of Petersburg with Russia against France.

The Dendermonde–Puurs Steam Railway (Stoomspoorlijn Dendermonde-Puurs) is a heritage railway situated in the Belgian provinces of East Flanders (Oost-Vlaanderen) and Antwerp (Antwerpen). 
It runs from the town of Dendermonde to the town of Puurs over about 14 km of [tpl]RailGauge|sg[/tpl] (standard gauge) track. The railway is maintained by BVS, a non-profit historical railway society. BVS, which stands for Belgische Vrienden van de Stoomlocomotief, or Belgian Friends of the Steam Locomotive, has a depot at the railway station in Baasrode-Noord. The trains are pulled by both steam and diesel locomotives.
The railway has been used occasionally by various film and television production companies to shoot movie scenes that are too elaborate to be filmed on the Belgian national railway network because of the potential disruption to traffic. The best known example of a movie that includes several scenes shot on the railway is Toto le Héros.

[[Counting]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary mathematics, Numeral systems, Mathematical logic

Counting is the action of finding the number of elements of a finite set of objects. The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. The related term enumeration refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element.
Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting money, counting out change, "counting by twos" (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...), or "counting by fives" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).
There is archeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for at least 50,000 years.An Introduction to the History of Mathematics (6th Edition) by Howard Eves (1990) p.9 Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as number of group members, prey animals, property, or debts  (i.e., accountancy). The development of counting led to the development of mathematical notation, numeral systems, and writing.

[[Common whipping]]

CATEGORIES: Whipping knots

The common whipping is the simplest type of whipping knot, a series of knots intended to stop a rope from unravelling. As it can slip off the rope easily, the common whipping should not be used for rope ends that will be handled. This whipping knot is also called 'wolf' whipping in some parts of the world. The 'Hangman's knot' is a variation of this whipping knot.
The benefit of a common whipping is that no tools are necessary and the rope does not need to be unlayed.  The problem is that it will slide off the end of the rope with little provocation.  Other whippings avoid this by interleaving the whipping with the strands of the rope and creating friction with the strands to avoid slipping.
Normally a natural fibre rope is whipped with twine. The size of the rope dictates the size of the twine. Any twine can be used, but tarred two strand hemp (marline) is preferred. Artificial-fibre ropes should have their ends fused by heat rather than whipped to prevent unravelling.

King Cole or Coel is a figure, or multiple figures with similar names, prominent in British literature and legend since the Middle Ages. Early Welsh tradition knew of a Coel Hen (Coel the Old), a leader in Roman or Sub-Roman Britain and the progenitor of several kingly lines in the Hen Ogledd ("the Old North"), the Brittonic-speaking part of northern England and southern Scotland. Later medieval legend told of a Coel, apparently derived from Coel Hen, who was the father of Saint Helena and the grandfather of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. Other similarly named characters may be confused or conflated with the Welsh Coel. The traditional "King Coel" may be the historical basis for the popular nursery rhyme "Old King Cole".Opie and Opie, pp. 134–135.

Oliver Otis Howard (November 8, 1830 – October 26, 1909) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War. As a brigade commander in the Army of the Potomac, Howard lost his right arm while leading his men against Confederate forces at Fair Oaks in June 1862, an action which later earned him the Medal of Honor. As a corps commander, he suffered two humiliating defeats at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg in May and July 1863, but recovered from the setbacks as a successful corps and later army commander in the Western Theater.
Known as the "Christian general" because he tried to base his policy decisions on his deep religious piety,David Thomson, "Oliver Otis Howard: Reassessing the Legacy of the 'Christian General'," American Nineteenth Century History 10 (September 2009), 273–98. he was given charge of the Freedmen's Bureau in mid-1865, with the mission of integrating the freed slaves into Southern society and politics during the second phase of the Reconstruction Era. Howard took charge of labor policy, setting up a system that required free slaves to work on former plantation land under pay scales fixed by the Bureau, on terms negotiated by the Bureau with white land owners.  Howard's Bureau was primarily responsible for the legal affairs of the freedmen.  He attempted to protect the Negros from hostile conditions, but lacked adequate power, and was repeatedly frustrated by President Andrew Johnson. Howard's allies, the Radical Republicans, won control of Congress in the 1866 elections and imposed Radical Reconstruction, with the result that freedmen were given the vote. With the help and advice of the Bureau, they joined Republican coalitions along with "carpetbaggers" and "scalawags" to take political control of most of the southern states.  Howard was also a leader in promoting higher education for freedmen, most notably in founding of Howard University in Washington and serving as its president 1867–73.
After 1874, Howard commanded troops in the West, conducting a famous campaign against the Nez Perce tribe. Utley (1987) concludes that his leadership against the Apaches in 1872, against the Nez Perce in 1877, the Bannocks and Paiutes in 1878, and against the Sheepeaters in 1879 all add up to an lengthy record, although he did not fight as much as George Custer and Nelson Miles.Robert M.

Anders Fogh Rasmussen ([tpl]IPA-da|ˈɑnɐs ˈfɔʊ̯ˀ ˈʁɑsmusn̩|-|Andersfogh_pronunciation.ogg[/tpl]; born 26 January 1953) is a Danish politician who serves as the 12th Secretary General of NATO. Rasmussen served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 27 November 2001 to 5 April 2009.
Rasmussen was the leader of the Liberal Party (Venstre), and headed a center right-wing coalition with the Conservative People's Party which took office in November 2001 and won its second and third terms in February 2005 and in November 2007. Rasmussen's government relied on the Danish People's Party for support, keeping with the Danish tradition of minority government.
In his early career, Rasmussen was a strident critic of the welfare state,[tpl]cite book |title=Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders |last=East |first=Roger |author2=Thomas, Richard |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-85743-126-1 |page=139 [/tpl] writing the classical liberal book From Social State to Minimal State in 1993. However, through the 1990s, his views moved towards the political centre.[tpl]cite book |title=Nordic, Central, and Southeastern Europe |last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry |isbn=978-1-887985-95-6 |page=72 [/tpl] His government introduced tougher limits on non-EEA immigration and a freeze on tax rates (skattestoppet in Danish). Certain taxes were lowered, but the Conservative coalition partners repeatedly argued for more tax cuts and a flat tax rate at no higher than 50%. Rasmussen's government implemented an administrative reform reducing the number of municipalities (kommuner) and replacing the thirteen counties (amter) with five regions, which he referred to as "the biggest reform in thirty years". He authored several books about taxation and government structure.
He is of no relation to either his predecessor Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, nor his successor Lars Løkke Rasmussen as Prime Minister of Denmark.
His term as Secretary General of NATO was to end in the summer of 2014. However, on 11 December 2013 the North Atlantic Council extended his term until 30 September 2014, in order to ensure the organisation of the 2014 NATO summit in Newport, Wales.

CATEGORIES: Angiosperm orders, Eudicots

Buxales is a botanical name at the rank of order.  

Buxales is an order of eudicot flowering plants which includes two families, Buxaceae and Haptanthaceae, recognized by the APG III system of 2009. APG III, unlike previous classifications, does not recognize Didymelaceae but includes the genus Didymeles in Buxaceae.[tpl]Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105–121 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122630309/abstract |accessdate=2010-12-10 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x [/tpl]
Under the APG II system, Buxaceae is a family unplaced as to order in the eudicots. This family may optionally include the genus Didymeles, which in Cronquist system was given its own family and order, placed in subclass Hamamelidae. APG II allows the option of continuing treating Didymeles as a family of its own. In addition, APG II mentioned the possibility that in a future version of the system the family Buxaceae might be elevated to ordinal status. In that case Buxales Takht. ex Reveal (1996) could become an order of one to two families. This name is so used by the AP-Website. This was later confirmed by the APG III system of 2009.

CATEGORIES: American football, Fantasy sports

Fantasy football is an interactive competition in which users compete against each other as general managers of virtual teams built from real players. The players that an individual is able to manage are professional American football players in the National Football League. The different actions people are able to make are drafting, trading, adding or dropping players, and changing rosters. Due to the growth of the Internet, fantasy football has vastly increased in popularity, particularly because fantasy football providers such as ESPN, Yahoo, CBS, and the NFL itself are able to keep track of statistics entirely online, eliminating the need to check box scores in newspapers regularly to keep track of players. Most leagues have a single week championship in week 16 of the NFL season.

[[Horse's Neck]]

CATEGORIES: Cocktails with whisky, Cocktails with bitters

[tpl]Other uses|Horseneck (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Horseneck[/tpl]

A Horse's Neck is an American cocktail recognised by the IBA. It is made with brandy (or sometimes bourbon) and ginger ale, with a long spiral of lemon peel (zest) draped over the edge of an 'old-fashioned' or highball glass. When made with Ale-8-One and Maker's Mark this drink is commonly referred to as a Kentucky Gentleman. A similar Canadian drink, the Rye & Ginger, is made with Canadian whisky and ginger ale.
Dating back to the 1890s, it was a non-alcoholic mixture of ginger ale, ice and lemon peel. By the 1910s, brandy, or bourbon would be added for a 'Horse's Neck with a Kick'  or ~ Stiff. The non-alcoholic version was still served in upstate New York in the late fifties or early sixties, but eventually it was phased out.
The drink is mentioned in Caught in a Cabaret, a 1914 silent film starring Charlie Chaplin.
In the 1935 Fred Astaire movie Top Hat, Helen Broderick orders "un altro Horse’s Neck" in a stylized Venetian canal cocktail lounge.
Horse's Neck is mentioned in the 1934 Lloyd Corrigan movie "By Your Leave", and also in the 1942 ZaSu Pitts' comedy, "So's Your Aunt Emma!"
The non-alcoholic version of the drink is referenced in the 1950 Humphrey Bogart film noir In A Lonely Place, in which Martha Stewart—playing the hat-check girl—states that adding bitters to ginger ale is called a “Horse’s Neck”.
Horse's Neck became popular in the wardrooms of the Royal Navy in the 1960s, displacing Pink Gin as the officers' signature drink. An early reference to this is made in the 1957 film Yangtse Incident, in which a Naval Officer is shown drinking a 'Horse's Neck' in 1949.  At naval cocktail parties (CTPs), it used to be served by the Mess Stewards ready-mixed in glass jugs, alongside similar jugs of mixed gin and tonic, with the request "H-N or G&T, Sir?"  
Ian Fleming, in the 1966 book Octopussy, describes the Horse's Neck as "the drunkard's drink"; he was also quite partial to them himself.

[[Wood carving]]

CATEGORIES: Woodcarving, Woodworking

Wood carving is a form of working wood by means of a cutting tool (knife) in one hand or a chisel by two hands or with one hand on a chisel and one hand on a mallet, resulting in a wooden figure or figurine, or in the sculptural ornamentation of a wooden object. The phrase may also refer to the finished product, from individual sculptures to hand-worked mouldings composing part of a tracery.
The making of sculpture in wood has been extremely widely practiced but survives much less well than the other main materials such as stone and bronze, as it is vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire.  It therefore forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures.See for example Martin Robertson, A shorter history of Greek art, p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1981, ISBN 0-521-28084-2, ISBN 978-0-521-28084-6 Google books   Outdoor wood sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the totem pole tradition developed.  Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and the great majority of African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions.  Wood is light and can take very fine detail so it is highly suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be worn or carried.  It is also much easier to work than stone.
Some of the finest extant examples of early European wood carving are from the Middle Ages in Germany, Russia, Italy and France, where the typical themes of that era were Christian iconography. In England, many complete examples remain from the 16th and 17th century, where oak was the preferred medium.

[tpl]Italic title[/tpl]

Amborella is a monotypic genus of rare understory shrubs or small trees endemic to the main island, Grande Terre, of New Caledonia. The genus is the only member of the family Amborellaceae and contains a single species, Amborella trichopoda Baill. Wood of Amborella lacks the vessels characteristic of most flowering plants. Amborella is of great interest to plant systematists because molecular phylogenetic analyses consistently place it at or near the base of the flowering plant lineage. That is, the Amborellaceae represent a line of flowering plants that diverged very early on (about 130 million years ago) from all the other extant species of flowering plants, and, among extant flowering plants, is the sister group to the other flowering plants. Comparing characteristics of this basal angiosperm, other flowering plants and fossils may provide clues about how flowers first appeared—what Darwin called the "abominable mystery".

[[New Jersey Route 208]]
CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Bergen County, New Jersey, Transportation in Passaic County, New Jersey, Ramapos, Limited-access roads in New Jersey, Freeways in the United States

Route 208 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States. It runs [tpl]convert|10.07|mi|km|2|adj=j[/tpl] from an interchange with Route 4 and County Route 79 (Saddle River Road) in Fair Lawn northwest to an interchange with Interstate 287 in Oakland. The route runs through suburban areas of Bergen and Passaic counties as four- to six-lane divided highway. It is constructed like a freeway, as intersections with cross roads are controlled by interchanges, but is not a controlled access road as several driveways exist. The route runs through the communities of Fair Lawn, Glen Rock, Hawthorne, Wyckoff, and Franklin Lakes along the way, interchanging with County Route 507 in Fair Lawn and County Route 502 in Franklin Lakes.
What is now Route 208 was initially planned as Route S4B in 1929, a spur of Route 4 that was to run from Fair Lawn northwest to the New York border in Greenwood Lake, where it would eventually connect to New York State Route 208. This route replaced what was planned as a part of Route 3 in 1927 between Paterson and Greenwood Lake. By the time the route was renumbered to Route 208 in 1953 to match NY 208, only a portion of the route in Fair Lawn from Route 4 to Maple Avenue had been built. Route 208 was completed west to U.S. Route 202 in Oakland by 1960 as a two-lane undivided road; it would be built into its present configuration in later years. A Route 208 freeway was planned across the Ramapo Mountains from Oakland to connect to a proposed NY 208 freeway at Greenwood Lake; however, it was never built. After Interstate 287 was extended from Montville to the New York border in 1993, it took over the alignment of Route 208 between U.S. Route 202 and the route’s current northern terminus. The last traffic signal along Route 208 at McBride Avenue was removed in 1997 and the interchange with Route 4 and Saddle River Road was reconstructed in 2002.

[[Signal (electrical engineering)]]

CATEGORIES: Engineering concepts, Digital signal processing, Signal processing, Telecommunication theory

[tpl]About|Signal in Electrical Engineering||Signal (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Signal[/tpl]
A signal as referred to in communication systems, signal processing, and electrical engineering  "is a function that conveys information about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon".  In the physical world,  any quantity exhibiting variation in time or variation in space (such as an image) is potentially a signal that might provide information on the status of a physical system, or convey a message between observers, among other possibilities. The IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing elaborates upon the term "signal" as follows:
Other examples of signals are the output of a thermocouple, which conveys temperature information, and the output of a pH meter which conveys acidity information. Typically, signals are often provided by a sensor, and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a transducer. For example, a microphone converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a speaker does the reverse.
The formal study of the information content of signals is the field of information theory. The information in a signal is usually accompanied by noise. The term noise usually means an undesirable random disturbance, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with the desired signal (such as crosstalk). The prevention of noise is covered in part under the heading of signal integrity. The separation of desired signals from a background is the field of signal recovery, one branch of which is estimation theory, a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances.
Engineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have led the way in the design, study, and implementation of systems involving transmission, storage, and manipulation of information. In the latter half of the 20th century, electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines, specialising in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals; electronic engineering and computer engineering as examples; while design engineering developed to deal with functional design of man–machine interfaces.

[[Ring modulation]]

CATEGORIES: Audio effects, Electronic musical instruments, Frequency mixers

Ring modulation is a signal-processing function in electronics, an implementation of amplitude modulation or frequency mixing, performed by multiplying two signals, where one is typically a sine-wave or another simple waveform. It is referred to as "ring" modulation because the analog circuit of diodes originally used to implement this technique took the shape of a ring.Richard Orton, "Ring Modulator", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001): "the ring modulator takes its name from the characteristic ring formation of four diodes in its analog circuit." This circuit is similar to a bridge rectifier, except that instead of the diodes facing "left" or "right", they go "clockwise" or "anti-clockwise". A ring modulator is an effects unit working on this principle.
The carrier, which is AC, at a given time, makes one pair of diodes conduct, and reverse-biases the other pair. The conducting pair carry the signal from the left transformer secondary to the primary of the transformer at the right.
If the left carrier terminal is positive, the top and bottom diodes conduct. If that terminal is negative, then the "side" diodes conduct, but create a polarity inversion between the transformers. This action is much like that of a DPDT switch wired for reversing connections.

[[Railway signal]]

CATEGORIES: Railway signalling

A signal is a mechanical or electrical device erected beside a railway line to pass information relating to the state of the line ahead to train/engine drivers (engineers in the US and New Zealand). The driver interprets the signal's indication and acts accordingly. Typically, a signal might inform the driver of the speed at which the train may safely proceed or it may instruct the driver to stop.

[[Signalling control]]

CATEGORIES: Railway signalling control

On a rail transport system, signalling control is the process by which control is exercised over train movements by way of railway signals and block systems to ensure that trains operate safely, over the correct route and to the proper timetable. Signalling control was originally exercised via a decentralised network of control points that were known by a variety of names including signal box (International and British), interlocking tower (North America), signal poste (France) and signal cabin (some railways e.g., GCR). Currently these decentralised systems are being consolidated into wide scale signalling centres or dispatch offices. Whatever the form, signalling control provides an interface between the human signal operator and the lineside signalling equipment. The technical apparatus used to control switches (points), signals and block systems is called interlocking.

The Moog company pioneered the commercial manufacture of modular voltage-controlled analog synthesizer systems in the mid 1960s.  The  technological development that led to the creation of the Moog synthesizer was the invention of the transistor, which enabled researchers like Moog to build electronic music systems that were considerably smaller, cheaper and far more reliable than earlier vacuum tube-based systems.
The Moog synthesizer gained wider attention in the music industry after it was demonstrated at the Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967. The commercial breakthrough of a Moog recording was made by Wendy Carlos in the 1968 record Switched-On Bach, which became one of the highest-selling classical music recordings of its era.Holmes (2002), p. 178. The success of Switched-On Bach sparked a slew of other synthesizer records in the late 1960s to mid-1970s.
Later Moog modular systems featured various improvements, such as a scaled-down, simplified, self-contained musical instrument designed for use in live performance.

[[Symyx Technologies]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical companies of the United States, Companies established in 1994, Companies based in Santa Clara, California

Symyx Technologies was a company specializing in the area of combinatorial chemistry. Symyx had a portion of its business that focused on software solution like Enterprise Laboratory Notebooks. This software business is now part of Accelrys. Symyx also offered laboratory robotics systems for performing automated chemical research. In 2010, this business was spun out as Freeslate, Inc.
Symyx offered high-speed combinatorial technologies for the discovery of new materials. Using proprietary technologies - including instruments, software and methods - Symyx was able to generate hundreds to thousands of unique materials at a time and screen those materials rapidly and automatically for desired properties. This approach can deliver results hundreds to thousands of times faster than traditional research methods, at a fraction of the cost.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.healthtech.com/news/strategic_briefings/2007/Symyx.asp |title= Symyx Technologies & Pharmaceutical R&D: A Synergistic Combo |date=July 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl]
Symyx is applied this technology to revolutionize materials discovery in the life sciences, chemical, and electronics industries. Founded in 1994 by Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni and Dr. Peter G. Schultz, Symyx' conceptual basis draws from Affymax, Inc. and Affymetrix, Inc., which commercialized the use of high-speed combinatorial methods for pharmaceutical and genetic research, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sma-digital.com/sma/200703/?pg=14 |title=Automated Research: Not just for pharma |date=April 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl]  Symyx screens about a million materials a year and has produced a product pipeline with several materials that have the potential to be commercialized in the next few years. Examples of their discovery efforts include X-ray storage phosphors for radiography, polymers to speed DNA research and catalysts for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and plastics.
In 2007 Symyx Technologies acquired  MDL Information Systems (originally Molecular Design Limited, Inc.), a provider of R&D informatics in the chemistry and life sciences industries, which had been launched as a computer-aided drug design firm in January 1978 in Hayward, California.  With this purchase came the purveyorship of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-NIOSH Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS, www.cdc.gov/niosh/rtecs), a database of basic toxicity information on household chemical substances, food additives, drugs, solvents, biocides, and chemical waste components which as of first quarter of 2012 contained ≈170,000 entries. In 2008, Symyx sold non-RTECS portions of the occupational health and safety (OHS) component of the MDL business to ChemAdvisor, Inc., of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Subsequent innovations derived from these business components included an enterprise electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) capable of supporting multiple scientific disciplines.Symyx Notebook, 2008 [tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl]
In 2010 Symyx spun off their laboratory robotics business as Freeslate, Inc. Freeslate now focuses on the delivery of high throughput systems for automating chemical research. Freeslate leverages its scientific expertise through its team of Ph.D. scientists, engineers, and software developers with directly relevant experience in the industries it serves to continue to deliver game changing high throughput solutions.

The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) or Canadian lynx is a North American mammal of the cat family, Felidae. It is a close relative of the Eurasian Lynx (Lynx lynx). However, in some characteristics the Canada lynx is more like the bobcat (Lynx rufus) than the Eurasian Lynx. With the recognised subspecies, it ranges across Canada and into Alaska as well as some parts of the northern United States.
With a dense silvery-brown coat, ruffed face and tufted ears, the Canada lynx resembles the other species of the mid-sized Lynx genus. It is larger than the bobcat, with which it shares parts of its range, and over twice the size of the domestic cat.

Black box theories are things defined only in terms of their function.Definition from Answers.comdefinition from highbeam The term black box theory is applied to any field, philosophy and science or otherwise where some inquiry or definition is made into the relations between the appearance of something (exterior/outside), i.e. here specifically the things black box state, related to its  characteristics and behaviour within (interior/inner).Black box theory applied briefly to Isaac NewtonUsage of term Specifically, the inquiry is focused upon a thing that has no immediately apparent characteristics and therefore has only factors for consideration held within itself hidden from immediate observation. The observer is assumed ignorant in the first instance as the majority of available data is held in an inner situation away from facile investigations. The black box element of the definition is shown as being characterised by a system where observable elements enter a perhaps imaginary box with a set of different outputs emerging which are also observable.Physics dept, Temple University, Philadelphia

[[Black box (phreaking)]]

CATEGORIES: Phreaking boxes

The black box (as distinguished from blue boxes and red boxes), was a small electronic circuit added to a telephone which provided the caller with a free call. A call originating from a telephone fitted with a black box would still be charged for by the telephone company unless the called telephone was also fitted with a black box, or some other method to circumvent the call charging was deployed. Black boxes were commonly built by phone phreaks during the 1960s to 1980s in order to provide callers with free telephone calls. Sometimes several friends would incorporate a black box into each of their telephones to enable them to hold long conversations with each other without having to pay for them. Another use of black boxes were in the incoming modems of computers running bulletin board systems that were popular back in the 1980s and early 90s.

Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application (e.g. what the software does) without peering into its internal structures or workings (see white-box testing).  This method of test can be applied to virtually every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It typically comprises most if not all higher level testing, but can also dominate unit testing as well. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

[[English National Opera]]
CATEGORIES: British opera companies, Gilbert and Sullivan, Opera in London, Organisations based in London

English National Opera (ENO) is an opera company based in London, resident at the London Coliseum in St. Martin's Lane. It is one of the two principal opera companies in London, along with The Royal Opera, Covent Garden. ENO's productions are sung in English.
The company's origins were in the late 19th century, when the philanthropist Emma Cons, later assisted by her niece Lilian Baylis, presented theatrical and operatic performances at the Old Vic in a rough area of London for the benefit of local people. From those beginnings, Baylis built up both the opera and the theatre companies, and later added a ballet company; these evolved into the ENO, the Royal National Theatre and The Royal Ballet.
Baylis acquired and rebuilt Sadler's Wells theatre in north London, a larger house, better suited to opera than the Old Vic. The opera company grew there into a permanent ensemble in the 1930s. During the Second World War, the theatre was closed and the company toured British towns and cities. After the war, the company returned to its home, but it continued to expand and improve, and by the 1960s a larger theatre was needed. In 1968, the company moved to the London Coliseum in the heart of London and adopted its present name in 1974. The company has survived several proposals to merge it with The Royal Opera.
Among the conductors associated with the company have been Colin Davis, Reginald Goodall, Charles Mackerras, Mark Elder and Edward Gardner. ENO is known for its emphasis on the dramatic aspect of opera, with productions, sometimes controversial, by directors including David Pountney, Jonathan Miller, Nicholas Hytner, Phyllida Lloyd and Calixto Bieito. In addition to the core operatic repertoire, ENO has presented a wide range of works, from early operas by Monteverdi to new commissions, operetta and Broadway shows.

Theodor Wulf (July 28, 1868 - June 19, 1946) was a German physicist and Jesuit priest who was one of the first experimenters to detect excess atmospheric radiation.
Theodor Wulf became a Jesuit priest at the age of 20, before studying physics with Walther Nernst at the University of Göttingen. He taught physics at Valkenburg, a Jesuit University from 1904 to 1914 and 1918-1935. He designed and built an electrometer which could detect the presence of energetic charged particles (or electromagnetic waves). Since natural radiation sources on the ground were detected by his electrometer, he predicted that if he moved far enough away from those sources he would detect less radiation.
To test his hypothesis, in 1910 he compared the radiation at the bottom and the top of the Eiffel Tower.  He found that the ionisation fell from 6 ions cm−3 to 3.5 ions cm−3 as he ascended the Eiffel Tower (330m).  If the ionisation had been due to γ-rays originating at the surface of the Earth, the intensity of ions should have halved in 80m.[tpl]cite book|last=Longair|first=M.S.|title=High energy astrophysics|year=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-23513-8|pages=11[/tpl]  Energy was coming from outside the Earth's atmosphere and being detected by his device; this radiation was from cosmic rays. He published a paper in Physikalische Zeitschrift detailing the results of his four days of observation on the Eiffel Tower. His results were not initially accepted.

The Phimai historical park ([tpl]lang-th|ปราสาทหินพิมาย[/tpl]) protects one of the most important  Khmer temples of Thailand. It is located in the town of Phimai, Nakhon Ratchasima province.
The temple marks one end of the Ancient Khmer Highway from Angkor. As the enclosed area of 1020x580m is comparable with that of Angkor Wat, Phimai must have been an important city in the Khmer empire. Most buildings are from the late 11th to the late 12th century, built in the Baphuon, Bayon and Angkor Wat style. However, even though the Khmer at that time were Hindu, the temple was built as a Buddhist temple,http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1919/ as Buddhism in the Khorat area dated back to the 7th century. Inscriptions name the site Vimayapura (which means city of Vimaya), which developed into the Thai name Phimai.
The first inventory of the ruins was done in 1901 by the French geographer Etienne Aymonier. They were put under governmental protection by announcement in the Government Gazette, Volume 53, section 34, from September 27, 1936. Most of the restorations were done from 1964 to 1969 as a joint Thai-French project. The historical park, now managed by the Fine Arts Department, was officially opened by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on April 12, 1989.
In the aftermath of the fall of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767, attempts were made to set up five separate states, with  Prince Teppipit, a son of king Boromakot, attempting to establish Phimai as one, holding sway over eastern provinces including Nakhon Ratchasima. The weakest of the five, Prince Teppipit was the first defeated and was executed in 1768. Phimai had also been an important town at the time of the Khmer. The temple Prasat Hin Phimai, located in the center of the town, was one of the major Khmer temples in ancient Thailand, connected with Angkor by an ancient Khmer Highway, and oriented so as to face Angkor as its cardinal direction. The site is now protected as the Phimai historical park.
Phimai has recently been the base of operations for the excavation of Ban Non Wat.

Dutch National Opera, DNO (formerly De Nederlandse Opera, now De Nationale Opera in Dutch) is a Dutch opera company based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Its present home base is the Dutch National Opera & Ballet, a modern building designed by Cees Dam and Wilhelm Holzbauer which opened in 1986.
DNO was established shortly after the end of World War II as a repertory company with a permanent ensemble. In the postwar period, it toured extensively in the Netherlands from its home base in the Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam, a fin de siècle theatre on the Leidseplein in Amsterdam.  In 1964, it was renamed De Nederlandse Operastichting. (The Dutch Opera Foundation), and the company adopted a stagione orientation, inviting different soloists and artistic teams for each new production.  In 1986, the company moved to the new Stopera building, which it shares with the Dutch National Ballet, and thereafter became known as De Nederlandse Opera (DNO). In 2014 its name was changed to Dutch National Opera.Pierre Audio, Director of the DNO, "On our way to a 50 years celebration": Announcement of 2014-15 season on company's website with wrong years included in first paragraph.
DNO has its own choir of sixty singers and a technical staff of 260.  DNO does not have its own resident orchestra, and so various orchestras of the Netherlands, including the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra (NPO), the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra (NKO), the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and the Asko[tpl]![/tpl]Schönberg ensemble have provided the orchestral forces for DNO productions.  
DNO produces on average eleven productions per year, with nearly all performances sold out.  While most performances are in the Dutch National Opera & Ballet building, the company has also performed in the Stadsschouwburg, at the Koninklijk Theater Carré, and on the Westergasfabriek industrial site in Amsterdam. For many years, the June production has been organized as part of the Holland Festival and includes the participation of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.  DNO has lent its productions to foreign companies, such as the Metropolitan Opera, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and the Lincoln Center Festival in New York, as well as the Adelaide Festival in Australia.
Since 1988, the French-Lebanese theatre director Pierre Audi has been artistic director of DNO.  Hartmut Haenchen was chief conductor from 1986 to 1999, in parallel with holding the title of chief conductor of the NPO.  He now holds the title of principal guest conductor with DNO.  Subsequent chief conductors have been Edo de Waart (1999-2004) and Ingo Metzmacher (2005-2008).  In March 2009, DNO announced the appointment of Marc Albrecht as the orchestra's next chief conductor, with the 2011-2012 season, for an initial contract of four years.[tpl]cite news | author=Merlijn Schooneboom | url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2676/Cultuur/article/detail/322107/2009/03/26/Albrecht-nieuwe-dirigent-opera-en-NedPhO.dhtml | title=Albrecht nieuwe dirigent opera en NedPhO | work=de Volksrant | date=2009-03-26 | accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news | author=Charlotte Smith | url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/newsMainTemplate.asp?storyID=3182&newssectionID=1 | title=Marc Albrecht named chief conductor of Netherlands Phil and De Nederlandse Opera | work=Gramophone | date=2009-03-31 | accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  This return to a single chief conductor at both DNO and the NPO/NKO allows for the NPO to become the principal opera orchestra for DNO.[tpl]cite news | author=Peter van der Lint | url=http://www.trouw.nl/opinie/columnisten/article2065470.ece/Richard_Strauss_levert_opnieuw_een_dubbele_chef_op_.html | title=Richard Strauss levert opnieuw een dubbele chef op | work=Trouw | date=2009-03-28 | accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl]

Unlike a synchronous condenser which is a rotating electrical machine, a static VAR compensator has no significant moving parts (other than internal switchgear).  Prior to the invention of the SVC, power factor compensation was the preserve of large rotating machines such as synchronous condensers or switched capacitor banks.[tpl]cite book|last=Ryan|first=H.M.|title=High Voltage Engineering and Testing|publisher=IEE|year=2001|pages=160–161|isbn=978-0-85296-775-1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jg1xA65n56oC&pg=PA160[/tpl]
The SVC is an automated impedance matching device, designed to bring the system closer to unity power factor. SVCs are used in two main situations:
In transmission applications, the SVC is used to regulate the grid voltage.  If the power system's reactive load is capacitive (leading), the SVC will use thyristor controlled reactors to consume VARs from the system, lowering the system voltage. Under inductive (lagging) conditions, the capacitor banks are automatically switched in, thus providing a higher system voltage. By connecting the thyristor-controlled reactor, which is continuously variable, along with a capacitor bank step, the net result is continuously-variable leading or lagging power. 
In industrial applications, SVCs are typically placed near high and rapidly varying loads, such as arc furnaces, where they can smooth flicker voltage.[tpl]cite book|last=Arrillaga,|first=J.|coauthors=Watson, N.

[[Massif]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms, Mountains

In geology, a massif is a section of a planet's crust that is demarcated by faults or flexures. In the movement of the crust, a massif tends to retain its internal structure while being displaced as a whole. The term is also used to refer to a group of mountains formed by such a structure.
In mountaineering and climbing literature, a massif is frequently used to denote the main mass of an individual mountain. The massif is a smaller structural unit of the crust than a tectonic plate and is considered the fourth largest driving force in geomorphology.Allen, 2008, Time scales of tectonic landscapes and their sediment routing systems, Geol. Soc. Lon. Sp. Pub., v. 296, p. 7–28.
The word is taken from French (in which the word also means "massive"), where it is used to refer to a large mountain mass or compact group of connected mountains forming an independent portion of a range. One of the most notable European examples of a massif is the Massif Central of the Auvergne region of France.
The Face on Mars is an example of an extraterrestrial massif.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060921_mars_images.html|title=Mars Face Makeover: Controversial Formation Observed from New Angles |last=Britt|first=Robert Roy|date=2006-09-21|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=2009-05-04[/tpl]

[[Sticker art]]
CATEGORIES: Art media, Graffiti and unauthorised signage, Stickers

Sticker art (also known as sticker bombing, sticker slapping, slap tagging, and sticker tagging) is a form of street art in which an image or message is publicly displayed using stickers. These stickers may promote a political agenda, comment on a policy or issue, or comprise a subcategory of Graffiti.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
Stickers can be placed anywhere accessible, with a much lower risk of apprehension by officials enforcing anti–vandalism laws.
Sticker artists use a variety of label types, including inexpensively purchased and free stickers, such as the United States Postal Service's Label 228 or name tags. Label 228's are often used with hand-drawn art, and are quite hard to remove, leaving a white, sticky residue.
Sticker artists can design and print thousands of stickers at low cost using a commercial printing service or at home with a computer printer and self-adhesive labels.
Sticker artists also print their designs onto adhesive vinyl, which has a strong, permanent adhesive, is waterproof, and generally fade resistant. A variant type of adhesive vinyl, called "destructible", is used by some artists. Destructible vinyl decals are primarily used as tamper indicators on equipment and shipping containers. The difficult–to–remove nature of this material is attractive to sticker artists, including B.N.E. and Obey Giant.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/article2199875.ece |title=Poster boy with a difference|last=Blackburn|first=Virginia|date=20 October 2007|publisher=The Times|accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]paywall[/tpl]

Camphor [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|f|ər[/tpl] is a waxy, flammable, white or transparent solid with a strong aromatic odor.[tpl]Cite book|author=Mann JC, Hobbs JB, Banthorpe DV, Harborne JB |title=Natural products: their chemistry and biological significance |publisher=Longman Scientific & Technical |location=Harlow, Essex, England |year=1994 |pages=309–11 |isbn=0-582-06009-5 [/tpl] It is a terpenoid with the chemical formula C10H16O.  It is found in wood of the camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), a large evergreen tree found in Asia (particularly in Sumatra, Borneo and Taiwan) and also of Dryobalanops aromatica, a giant of the Bornean forests. It also occurs in some other related trees in the laurel family, notably Ocotea usambarensis. Dried rosemary leaves (Rosmarinus officinalis), in the mint family, contain up to 20% camphor.  It can also be synthetically produced from oil of turpentine. It is used for its scent, as an ingredient in cooking (mainly in India), as an embalming fluid, for medicinal purposes, and in religious ceremonies. A major source of camphor in Asia is camphor basil.
Norcamphor is a camphor derivative with the three methyl groups replaced by hydrogen.

Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville (December 5, 1827 - February, 1910), was a French historian and philologist.
He was born at Nancy.  In 1851 he left the École des Chartes with the degree of palaeographic archivist. He was placed in control of the departmental archives of Aube, and remained in that position until 1880, when he retired on a pension.
He published several volumes of inventorial abstracts, a Répertoire archéologique du département in 1861; a valuable Histoire des ducs et comtes de Champagne depuis le VIe siècle jusqu'à la fin du XIe, which was published between 1859 and 1869 (8 volumes), and in 1880 an instructive monograph, Les Intendants de Champagne. Already he had become attracted to the study of the ancient inhabitants of Gaul; in 1870 he brought out an Étude sur la déclinaison des noms propres dans la langue franque à l'époque mérovingienne; and in 1877 a learned work on Les Premiers habitants de l'Europe (2nd edition in 2 vols. 1889 and 1894).
Next he concentrated his efforts on the field of Celtic languages, literature and law, in which he soon became an authority. Appointed in 1882 to the newly founded professorial chair of Celtic at the Collège de France, he began the Cours de littérature celtique in 1908 extended to twelve volumes. For this he himself edited the following works: Introduction à l'étude de la littérature celtique (1883); L'Épopée celtique en Irlande (1892); Études de droit celtique (1895); and Les Principaux auteurs de l'Antiquité à consulter sur l'histoire des Celtes (1902).
He was among the first in France to study the most ancient monuments of Irish literature with a solid philological preparation and without prejudice.

The caracal [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ær|ə|k|æ|l[/tpl] (Caracal caracal), also known as the desert lynx, is a wild cat widely distributed across Africa, central Asia, and southwest Asia into India. In 2002, the IUCN listed the caracal as Least Concern, as it is widespread and relatively common. The felid is considered threatened in North Africa, and rare in the central Asian republics and India.[tpl]IUCN |assessors= Breitenmoser, C., Henschel, P. and Sogbohossou, E.|year=2008 |id=3847 |title= Caracal caracal |version=2012.2[/tpl]

[[In a Station of the Metro]]

CATEGORIES: American poems, 1913 poems, Works by Ezra Pound, Works originally published in Poetry (magazine)

"In A Station of the Metro" is an Imagist poem by Ezra Pound published in 1913 in the literary magazine Poetry.Axelrod, Steven Gould and Camille Roman, Thomas J. Travisano.The New Anthology of American Poetry: Traditions and Revolutions, Beginnings to 1900.Rutgers University Press (2003) p.663 In the poem, Pound describes a moment in the underground metro station in Paris in 1912;  Pound suggested that the faces of the individuals in the metro were best put into a poem not with a description but with an "equation". Because of the  treatment of the subject's appearance by way of the poem's own visuality, it is considered a quintessential Imagist text.
The poem was reprinted in Pound's collection Lustra in 1917, and again in the 1926 anthology Personae: The Collected Poems of Ezra Pound, which compiled his early pre-Hugh Selwyn Mauberley works.

[[ISO/IEC 8859-11]]

CATEGORIES: Thai language, ISO/IEC 8859

ISO/IEC 8859-11:2001, Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 11: Latin/Thai alphabet, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 2001. It is informally referred to as Latin/Thai. It is nearly identical to the national Thai standard TIS-620 (1990). The sole difference is that ISO/IEC 8859-11 allocates non-breaking space to code 0xA0, while TIS-620 leaves it undefined. (In practice, this small distinction is usually ignored.)
ISO-8859-11 is not a registered IANA charset name despite following the normal pattern for IANA charsets based on the ISO 8859 series. However, the close equivalent TIS-620 (which lacks the non-breaking space) is registered with IANA, and can without problems be used for ISO/IEC 8859-11, since the no-break space has a code which was unallocated in TIS-620.
As with all varieties of ISO/IEC 8859, the lower 128 codes are equivalent to ASCII. The additional characters, apart from no-break space, are found in Unicode in the same order, only shifted from 0xA1 to U+0E01 and so forth.
The Microsoft Windows code page 874 as well as the code page used in the Thai version of the Apple Macintosh, MacThai, are extensions of TIS-620 — incompatible with each other, however.

Lake Simcoe is a lake in Southern Ontario, Canada, the fourth-largest lake wholly in the province, after Lake Nipigon, Lac Seul, and Lake Nipissing. At the time of the first European contact in the 17th century the lake was called Ouentironk ("Beautiful Water") by the Huron natives. It was also known as Lake Toronto until it was renamed by John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, in memory of his father.
The lake is bordered by Simcoe County, Durham Region, and York Region. The city of Barrie is located on Kempenfelt Bay, and Orillia is located at the entrance to Lake Couchiching. The watershed draining into the lake contains a population of roughly half a million people, including the northern portion of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
The town of Georgina lies along the entire south shore of Lake Simcoe and consists of smaller residential towns and communities, including Keswick on Cook's Bay, Sutton, Jackson's Point, Pefferlaw, and Udora.
The town of Innisfil occupies the western shore south of Barrie and north of Bradford.
