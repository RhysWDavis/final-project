[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]

CATEGORIES: Mahayana sutras, Mahayana texts

The Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra (Sanskrit: विमलकीर्ति निर्देश सूत्र), or Vimalakīrti Sūtra, is a Mahāyāna Buddhist sūtra. Sometimes used in the title, the word nirdeśa means "instruction/advice". The sutra teaches, among other subjects, the meaning of nonduality. It contains a report of a teaching addressed to both arhats and bodhisattvas by the layman Vimalakīrti ("Undefiled Reputation"), who expounds the doctrine of śūnyatā, or emptiness, to them. This culminates with the wordless teaching of silence.
The sutra has been influential in East Asian Buddhism for its "brash humor" and flexibility. It has also been influential in Mahāyāna for its inclusiveness and respect of non-clergy, as well as stating the equal role of Buddhist women, who are considered to have as much spiritual potential as ordained male monks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

[[The Mangy Parrot]]

CATEGORIES: 1816 novels, 1831 novels, Mexican novels, 1831 in Mexico, Fictional parrots, Picaresque novels, Novels set in Mexico

The Mangy Parrot: The Life and Times of Periquillo Sarniento Written by himself for his Children ([tpl]lang-es|El Periquillo Sarniento[/tpl]) by Mexican author José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, is generally considered the first novel written and published in Latin America. El Periquillo was written in 1816, though due to government censorship the last of four volumes were not published until 1831. The novel has been continuously in print in more than twenty editions since then.
El Periquillo Sarniento can be read as a nation-building novel, written at a critical moment in the transition of Mexico (and Latin America) from colony to independence. Jean Franco has characterized the novel as "a ferocious indictment of Spanish administration in Mexico: ignorance, superstition and corruption are seen to be its most notable characteristics" Franco, An Introduction to Spanish-American Literature (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 34; cited in Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, revised edition (London: Verso, 1991), p. 29.
Given Lizardi's career as a pioneering Mexican journalist, his novel can also be read as a journal of opinion in the guise of a picaresque novel. It follows the adventures of Pedro Sarmiento (nicknamed "Periquillo Sarniento" or "Mangy Parrot" by his disreputable friends), who, like Lizardi himself, is the son of a Criollo family from Mexico City with more pretensions to "good birth" than means of support. The story begins with Periquillo’s birth and miseducation and continues through his endless attempts to make an unearned living, as a student, a friar, a gambler, a notary, a barber, a pharmacist, a doctor, a beggar, a soldier, a count, and a thief, until late in life he sees the light and begins to lead an honest life.
At every point along the way, Lizardi uses the deathbed voice of the elderly and repentant Periquillo to lambast the social conditions that led to his wasted life. In this, the novelist mimics the role of the early nineteenth-century journalist more interested in arguing opinions than relating mundane incidents. The marriage of slapstick humor with moralizing social commentary, established in El Periquillo, remained a constant in the Mexican novels that followed on its heels throughout the nineteenth century (Antonio Benitez-Rojo, "José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi and the Emergence of the Spanish American Novel as National Project," Modern Language Quarterly 57 (2): pp. 334–35). Agustín Yáñez justifies this often criticized "moralizing" tendency in Lizardi as "a constant in the artistic production of Mexico… and moreover, it is a constant in Mexican life" ("El Pensador Mexicano," in Cedomil Goic, ed., Historia y crítica de la literatura hispanoamericana, t. I, Época colonial, Barcelona: Grijalbo, 1988, pp. 428–29).
At the same time, as critics have noted, Lizardi's interest in depicting the realities and reproducing the speech of Mexicans from all social classes make his novel a bridge between the inherited picaresque mold that forms its overt structure and the costumbrista novels of the nineteenth century.

[[Antoninianus]]

CATEGORIES: Coins of ancient Rome, Severan dynasty

The Antoninianus was a coin used during the Roman Empire thought to have been valued at 2 denarii. It was initially silver, but was slowly debased to bronze. The coin was introduced by Caracalla in early 215 and was a silver coin similar to the denarius except that it was slightly larger and featured the emperor wearing a radiate crown, indicating that it was valued at twice as much. Antoniniani depicting females (usually the emperor's wife), featured the bust resting upon a crescent moon.http://www.24carat.co.uk/antoninianiframe.html Antoninianus from 24carat.co Accessed 2008-05-02 
But even at its introduction the silver content was only equal to 1.5 denarii. This helped create inflation - people rapidly hoarded the denarii, while both buyers and sellers recognised the new coin had a lower intrinsic value and elevated their prices to compensate. Silver bullion supplies were running short since the Roman Empire was no longer conquering new territory, the Iberian silver mines were exhausted and a series of soldier emperors and usurpers needed coin to pay their troops and buy their loyalty. So each new issue of the antoninianus had less silver in it than the last, and each contributed to ever increasing inflation. 
In 271 Aurelian increased the average weight of the Antoninianus. This was carried out for a short time. This was also when the enigmatic 'XXI' was first marked on the reverse of the antoninianus. The true meaning of this series of numbers is still a topic of debate, but it is thought to represent a 20:1 silver ratio (4.76% silver).
By the late 3rd century the coins were almost entirely made of bronze from melted down old issues like the sestertius. Vast quantities were being minted, with a large proportion of the stocks being contemporary forgeries, often with blundered legends and designs. Individual coins were by then practically worthless and were lost or discarded by the millions. 
Today most of these coins are extremely common finds, with a few more scarce examples (Aemilianus, Marcus Aurelius Marius, Quietus, Regalianus to name a few). The situation was not unlike the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in 1920s Germany when paper money was printed in reckless abundance. The coin ceased to be used by the end of the 3rd century when a series of coinage reforms attempted to arrest the decline by issuing new types.
Modern numismatists use this name for the coin because it is not known what it was called in antiquity. The name was given to it because an ancient Roman document called the Historia Augusta (of generally low reliability) refers to silver coins named after an Antoninus on several occasions (several Roman emperors in the late 2nd  and early 3rd centuries bore this name among others). Because Caracalla's silver coin was a new issue, and he had taken Antoninus as part of his imperial name, an association was made with it, and although the association is certainly false, the name has stuck.

[[Brownian tree]]

CATEGORIES: Computer art, Stochastic processes

A Brownian tree, whose name is derived from Robert Brown via Brownian motion, is a form of computer art that was briefly popular in the 1990s, when home computers started to have sufficient power to simulate Brownian motion. Brownian trees are mathematical models of dendritic structures associated with the physical process known as diffusion-limited aggregation.
A Brownian tree is built with these steps: first, a "seed" is placed somewhere on the screen. Then, a particle is placed in a random position of the screen, and moved randomly until it bumps against the seed. The particle is left there, and another particle is placed in a random position and moved until it bumps against the seed or any previous particle, and so on.
The resulting tree can have many different shapes, depending on principally three factors:
Particle color can change between iterations, giving interesting effects.
At the time of their popularity (helped by a Scientific American article in the Computer Recreations section, December 1988), a common computer took hours, and even days, to generate a small tree. Today's computers can generate trees with tens of thousands of particles in minutes or seconds.
These trees can also be grown easily in an electrodeposition cell, and are the direct result of diffusion-limited aggregation.

[[Riblet Tramway Company]]

The Riblet Tramway Company of Spokane, Washington[tpl]citation|url=http://www.riblet.com/|title=Riblet website|accessdate=2012-10-18[/tpl] was once the largest ski chairlift manufacturer in the world.
The Riblet Tramway Company was founded by Byron Christian Riblet. Riblet was born in Osage, Iowa, in 1865 and earned a
degree in Civil Engineering. Arriving in Spokane in 1885, his first work was laying out railway and streetcar lines. He also built dams and irrigation projects.
In 1896, Riblet was contracted to erect a Finlayson ore[tpl]Clarify|date=December 2011[/tpl] tramway at the Noble Five silver mine in Sandon, British Columbia, to assist in moving ore down Reco Mountain to the mill at Cody. Apparently Riblet thought he was coming to build a streetcar line. Even so, Riblet decided he could improve the mining tram performance. Over time, Riblet raised more tramways in the booming mining district, building thirty aerial tramways in the next ten years. Riblet returned to Spokane in 1908, after working in the Kootenays, to found the Riblet Tramway Company. This company specialised in mining tramways building them in Alaska, Canada, the Western United States and South America.
Riblet built its first chairlift in 1938 at Mount Hood, Oregon. Byron Riblet died in 1952, but the company boomed with the new, postwar ski resorts. Skiing gained in popularity, and soon ski lifts became the major part of the Riblet Tramway Company's business. They built numerous lifts, particularly in Washington, Oregon and California, and even as far away as Australia.  The company installed over 400 chairlifts. They have the most double chair lifts operating in the U.S. 
The company only built fixed-grip lifts, where the chair grip is woven into the haul rope rather than clamped onto it; because of the limited market for such lifts, it announced in early 2003 that the firm was no longer viable and was going out of business.[ref]

The Paasikivi-Kekkonen line refers to the doctrine  President Urho Kekkonen’s (1956–1981) realization and development of his predecessor Paasikivi’s doctrine, aimed at Finland’s survival as an independent sovereign democratic and capitalist country in the immediate proximity of the Soviet Union.
The principal architect of Finland's postwar foreign policy of neutrality was Juho Kusti Paasikivi, who was president from 1946 to 1956. Urho Kekkonen, president from 1956 until 1981, further developed this policy, stressing that Finland should be an active rather than a passive neutral.

[[Ria]]
CATEGORIES: Coastal and oceanic landforms

A ria is a coastal inlet formed by the partial submergence of an unglaciated river valley. It is a drowned river valley that remains open to the sea. Typically, rias have a dendritic, treelike outline although they can be straight and without significant branches. This pattern is inherited from the dendritic drainage pattern of the flooded river valley. The drowning of river valleys along a stretch of coast and formation of rias results in an extremely irregular and indented coastline. Often, there are islands, which are summits of partly submerged, pre-existing hill peaks. A ria coast is a coastline having several parallel rias separated by prominent ridges, extending a distance inland.Bird, E.C.F., 2008, Coastal Geomorphology: An Introduction, 2nd ed. John Wiley and Sons Ltd. West Sussex, England.Cotton, C. (1956) Rias sensu stricto and sensu lato. Geographical Journal. 122(3):360–364.Goudie, A. (2004) Encyclopedia of Geomorphology. Routledge. London, England. The sea level change that caused the submergence of a river valley may be either eustatic (where global sea levels rise), or isostatic (where the local land sinks). The result is often a very large estuary at the mouth of a relatively insignificant river (or else sediments would quickly fill the ria). The Kingsbridge Estuary in Devon, England, is an extreme example of a ria forming an estuary disproportionate to the size of its river; no significant river flows into it at all, only a number of small streams.

The Eurasian Curlew (Numenius arquata) is a wader in the large family Scolopacidae. It is one of the most widespread of the curlews, breeding across temperate Europe and Asia. In Europe, this species is often referred to just as the "Curlew", and in Scotland known as the "whaup" in Scots.
This is the largest wader in its range, at [tpl]convert|50|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, with a [tpl]convert|89|-|106|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] wingspan and a body weight of [tpl]convert|410|-|1360|g|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), ISBN 978-0-8493-4258-5. It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back, and a very long curved bill. Males and females look identical, but the bill is longest in the adult female. It is generally not possible to recognize the sex of a single Eurasian Curlew, or even several ones as there is much variation; telling male and female of a mated pair apart is usually possible however.
The familiar call, from which this bird gets it name, is a loud curloo-oo.
The only similar species over most of the Curlew's range is the Whimbrel (N. phaeopus). The Whimbrel is smaller and has a shorter bill with a kink rather than a smooth curve. Flying Curlews may also resemble, albeit not existing in the same area, Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) in their winter plumages; however, the latter have a smaller body, a slightly upturned beak, and legs that do not reach far beyond their tail tips. The Eurasian Curlew's feet are longer, forming a conspicuous "point".
The Curlew exists as a migratory species over most of its range, wintering in Africa, southern Europe and south Asia. Occasionally a vagrant individual reaches places far from its normal range, such as Nova ScotiaNHMNS (1998) and the Marianas.Wiles et al. (2000, 2004) It is present all year in the milder climates of the United Kingdom and its adjacent European coasts.
It is generally wary. Highly gregarious outside the breeding season, the Eurasian Curlew feeds by probing soft mud for small invertebrates, but will also pick small crabs and earthworms off the surface if the opportunity arises.
The nest is a bare scrape on taiga, meadow, and similar habitats. Each Curlew lays between 3 and 6 eggs in April or May and incubates them for about a month until they begin to hatch.
The Curlew is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.
Formerly classified as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN, it was suspected to be rarer than generally assumed. Following the evaluation of its population size, this was found to be incorrect, and it was consequently promoted to Near Threatened status in 2008. Though it is a common bird, its numbers are noticeably declining.BLI (2008) In Ireland, for example, the breeding population is estimated to have declined by 86% in the last 30 years.Maguire, Stephen "Endangered Curlew- Conservation drive started to save species"  Irish Times 28/02/2014

It continued to be used during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines up until the late 19th Century.

Modern scripts in the Philippines, descended from Baybayin, are Hanunó'o, Buhid, Tagbanwa and Kapampangan script.
Baybayin is one of a number individual writing systems used in Southeast Asia, nearly all of which are abugidas where any consonant is pronounced with the inherent vowel a following it— diacritical marks being used to express other vowels (this vowel occurs with greatest frequency in Sanskrit, and also probably in all Philippine languages). Many of these writing systems descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although the baybayin does share some, there is no evidence that it is this old.

A barrage balloon, sometimes called a "blimp,"Wragg, D.; Historical Dictionary of Aviation, History Press (2008), Page 27: "During the Second World War, the main combatants used barrage balloons, or blimps..." is a large balloon tethered with metal cables, used to defend against aircraft attack by damaging the aircraft on collision with the cables, or at least making the attacker's approach more difficult.  Commonly the designs were kite balloons, having a shape and cable bridling which stabilise the balloon in windy conditions, allowing operation in higher winds than a spherical balloon. Some examples carried small explosive charges that would be pulled up against the aircraft to ensure its destruction.  Barrage balloons are not practical against very high-flying aircraft, due to the weight of a very long cable.

The Hyderābād State [tpl]audio|Hyderabad.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl] was located in the south-central region of the Indian subcontinent, and was ruled, from 1724 until 1948, by a hereditary Nizam. The capital city was Hyderabad.
The Asaf Jahi was a dynasty of Turkic origin from the region around Samarkand in modern-day Uzbekistan, who came to India in the late 17th century, and became employees of the Mughal Empire. The region became part of the Mughal Empire in the 1680s. When the empire began to weaken in the 18th century, Asif Jah defeated a rival Mughal governor's attempt to seize control of the empire's southern provinces, declaring himself Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad in 1724. The Mughal emperor, under renewed attack from the Marathas, was unable to prevent it.
Following the decline of the Mughal power, India saw the rise of Maratha Empire, Nizam himself saw many invasions by the Marathas. Some of the major battles fought between Marathas and Nizam include Battle of Rakshasbhuvan and Battle of Palkhed.
Dictionary of Battles and Sieges - Google BooksThe State At War In South Asia - Pradeep Barua - Google Books
In 1798 Hyderabad became a princely states under British East India Company's suzerainty. By a subsidiary alliance it had ceded to the British East India company the control of its external affairs.
In 1903 the Berar region of the state was separated and merged into the Central Provinces of British India, to form the Central Provinces and Berar.
In 1947, at the time of the partition of India, British offered the various princely states in the sub-continent the option of acceding to either India or Pakistan, or staying on as an independent state.
At the time of the partition of India, the State of Hyderabad was the largest and most prosperous of all princely states in India. It covered [tpl]convert|82698|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of fairly homogenous territory and comprised a population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census) of which a majority (85%) was Hindu. Hyderabad State had its own army, airline, telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and radio broadcasting service.
Nizam decided to keep Hyderabad independent. The leaders of the new Union of India however, were wary of having an independent - and possibly hostile - state in the heart of their new country. Most of the other 565 princely states had already acceded to India or to Pakistan voluntarily. The Indian government was therefore determined to annex Hyderabad into the Indian Union, by force if necessary.
In September 1948, India launched a military operation named Operation Polo, led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, then Minister of Home Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister of India. The Indian Armed Forces invaded the State of Hyderabad and overthrew Nizam.http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=K/KtVO4bQNg=&ParentID=a2GSpnDbruI=http://www.hyderabad.co.uk/policeaction.htm
Seven Nizams had ruled Hyderabad State for two centuries until the Indian conquest of Hyderabad in 1948 brought about the end of the dynasty. The Asaf Jahi rulers were great patrons of literature, art, architecture, culture, jewellery, and rich food. The Nizams patronized Persian art, Persian Architecture, and Persian culture, which became central to the Hyderabadi Muslim identity. They also introduced electricity, developed the railways and the roads, air communications, irrigation and reservoirs. The last Nizam was well known for his huge wealth and jewelry collection; he had been the richest man in the world until the end of his reign.Top ten richest men of all time at instash.com  Indeed, all major public buildings in Hyderabad City were built during his reign, while the British Raj was supreme. He pushed education, science, and the establishment of Osmania University.

[[Joe Btfsplk]]

CATEGORIES: Comics characters, Luck, Li'l Abner

Joe Btfsplk was a character in the satirical comic strip Li'l Abner by cartoonist Al Capp (1909–1979). He is well-meaning, but is the world's worst jinx, bringing disastrous misfortune to everyone around him. A small, dark rain cloud perpetually hovers over his head to symbolize his bad luck. Hapless Btfsplk and his ever-present cloud became one of the most iconic images in Li'l Abner.
One storyline in the early 1970s features him trapping his cloud in a special anti-pollutant jar. Joe becomes romantically involved with a gal for the first time—until her crazed ex-boyfriend shows up to kill him. Joe reluctantly opens the jar and releases his cloud in order to take care of the boyfriend, and wistfully realizes that he wasn't meant for any other kind of life. As he returns to his normal, loner existence, his cloud once again in tow, he is for the moment satisfied to be who he really is.
In addition to the obvious comic effect, Capp often used Joe Btfsplk as a deus ex machina to produce miraculous rescues or to effect plot twists. Joe was later licensed for use in a series of animated TV commercials for Head & Shoulders, a dandruff shampoo.

The ridged band is a an band of highly innervated wrinkly skin toward the end of the foreskin. The term ridged is used to describe the area instead of the more commonly used term "wrinkled". It has, especially in regards to phimosis (and preputioplasty), been called a preputial ring or phimotic ring. Ring being analogous to 'band', referring to the shape, and preputial meaning pertaining to the prepuce.
More particularly it refers to the "transitional area from the external to the internal surface of
the prepuce," or foreskin.[tpl]cite journal | last = Sorrells | first = M.L. | coauthors = J.L. Snyder, M.D. Reiss, C. Eden, M.F. Milos, N. Wilcox and R.S.

The mean age was 37 years, range 22-58. The prepuces were studied grossly and histologically.
The term "ridged band" was subsequently used by Taylor in an anatomical and histological study of the foreskin published in the British Journal of Urology in 1996.[ref]

The title was inspired by a crayon-made story book written by guitarist Larry LaLonde's son,Blame It on the Fish and the cover depicts a sculpture made by long-time Primus collaborator Lance "Link" Montoya. The DVD features all of the band's music videos to date, plus short films and live footage from as far back as 1986, whereas the bonus EP features five new songs written and recorded specifically for this release. When promoting the release, bassist Les Claypool remarked that "It seems of late that bands are adding supplemental DVD material to their album releases to promote record sales. We've done the opposite. We've added a supplemental audio recording of brand new music to an extremely comprehensive DVD of classic visuals."Press release at Primusville.com
Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People shows the return of drummer Tim Alexander to the lineup, who had previously left the band in 1996. He joins Claypool and LaLonde in performing on the EP, as well as providing commentary for the DVD. Claypool has claimed that two of the five new songs on the EP were written within the first 45 minutes of the lineup working together again, and "Pilcher's Squad" was said to have been written and recorded within a single afternoon.

He took power after the death of Fedlimid Rechtmar.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gabála Érenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 331 He is said to have had thirty sons, but only ten of them had children; several medieval dynasties of Leinster traced their ancestors to them.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar Éirinn 1.40The Testament of Cathair Mór, translated by Miles Dillon His daughter Cochrann was said to have been the mother of the fenian hero Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.James MacKillop, Dictionary of Celtic Mythology, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 72

Cathair's daughter Eithne Tháebfhota is fostered by a hospitable Leinsterman named Buchet who has many herds of cattle, but Cathair's sons so exploit Buchet's hospitality that he is left with only one bull and seven cows, and the king, now old and enfeebled, is unable to restrain them.

CompactFlash (CF) is a mass storage device format used in portable electronic devices. The format was first specified and produced by SanDisk in 1994.Digiprint Uk It is now used for a variety of devices; most contain flash memory but some, such as the Microdrive, contain a hard disk.
CompactFlash became the most successful of the early memory card formats, surpassing  Miniature Card, SmartMedia, and PC Card Type I in popularity. Subsequent formats, such as MMC/SD, various Memory Stick formats, and xD-Picture Card offered stiff competition. Most of these cards are smaller than CompactFlash while offering comparable capacity and speed. Proprietary memory card formats for use in professional audio and video, such as P2 and SxS, are physically larger, faster, and costlier.
CompactFlash remains popular and is supported not only in many high end consumer devices, but in some professional applications as well.

"Billie Jean" is a song by the American recording artist Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer's sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written and composed by Michael Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. Originally disliked by Jones, the track was almost removed from the album after he and Jackson had disagreements regarding it. There are contradictory claims to what the song's lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson had fathered one of her twins. Jackson himself, however, stated that "Billie Jean" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline and Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.
"Billie Jean" became a worldwide commercial and critical success; "Billie Jean" was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, "Billie Jean" topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. "Billie Jean" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed "Billie Jean" in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
Awarded numerous honors — including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame — the song and corresponding music video propelled Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV's racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation.  Also, Jackson's Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his "moonwalk" also helped to popularize the song. The song was also promoted through Jackson's Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson's scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, "Billie Jean" sealed Jackson's status as an international pop icon.

[[Intense pulsed light]]

CATEGORIES: Depilation

Intense pulsed light, commonly abbreviated as IPL, is a technology used by beauty studios and medical practitioners to perform various skin treatments including hair removal and photorejuvenation. The technology utilises a broad spectrum lightsource, with a general spectral range of 515 to 1200 nm.  Various cutoff filters are commonly used to filter out lower frequencies and narrow this spectrum to target specific structures and chromophores.  Because of the broad spectrum of the IPL light source they are unique, as opposed to lasers, in the ability to filter the light spectrum to target various chromophores in the skin.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gold|first=Michael H.|title=Lasers and light sources for the removal of unwanted hair|journal=Clinics in Dermatology|date=September–October 2007|volume=25|issue=5|pages=443–453|doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2007.05.017[/tpl]

[[Immunity (medical)]]

CATEGORIES: Immunology

In biology, immunity is the state of having sufficient biological defences to avoid infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion. It is the capability of the body to resist harmful microbes from entering it. Immunity involves both specific and non-specific components. The non-specific components act either as barriers or as eliminators of wide range of pathogens irrespective of antigenic specificity. Other components of the immune system adapt themselves to each new disease encountered and are able to generate pathogen-specific immunity.
Innate immunity, or nonspecific immunity is the natural resistances with which a person is born. It provides resistances through several physical, chemical and cellular approaches. Microbes first encounter the epithelial layers, physical barriers that line skin and mucous membranes. Subsequent general defences include secreted chemical signals (cytokines), antimicrobial substances, fever, and phagocytic activity associated with the inflammatory responses. The phagocytes express cell surface receptors that can bind and respond to common molecular patterns expressed on the surface of invading microbes. Through these approaches, innate immunity can prevent the colonization, entry and spread of microbes.
Adaptive immunity is often sub-divided into two major types depending on how the immunity was introduced. Naturally acquired immunity occurs through contact with a disease causing agent, when the contact was not deliberate, whereas artificially acquired immunity develops only through deliberate actions such as vaccination. Both naturally and artificially acquired immunity can be further subdivided depending on whether immunity is induced in the host or passively transferred from an immune host. Passive immunity is acquired through transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells from an immune host, and is short lived—usually lasting only a few months—whereas active immunity is induced in the host itself by antigen and lasts much longer, sometimes lifelong. The diagram below summarizes these divisions of immunity.
A further subdivision of adaptive immunity is characterized by the cells involved; humoral immunity is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by secreted antibodies, whereas the protection provided by cell mediated immunity involves T-lymphocytes alone. Humoral immunity is active when the organism generates its own antibodies, and passive when antibodies are transferred between individuals. Similarly, cell mediated immunity is active when the organisms’ own T-cells are stimulated and passive when T cells come from another organism.

[[Rapid eye movement behavior disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Sleep disorders, Psychiatric diagnosis

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder (more specifically a parasomnia) that involves abnormal behaviour during the sleep phase with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It was first described in 1986.
The major and arguably only abnormal feature of RBD is loss of muscle atonia (paralysis) during otherwise intact REM sleep. This is the stage of sleep in which most vivid dreaming occurs. The loss of motor inhibition leads to a wide spectrum of behavioural release during sleep. This extends from simple limb twitches to more complex integrated movement, in which sufferers appear to be unconsciously acting out their dreams. These behaviours can be violent in nature and in some cases will result in injury to either the patient or their bed partner.

[tpl]nihongo|Boogiepop Phantom|ブギーポップは笑わない Boogiepop Phantom|Bugīpoppu wa Warawanai Boogiepop Phantom|literally "Boogiepop Never Laughs: Boogiepop Phantom"[/tpl] is a twelve-episode anime television series produced by Madhouse Studios, based on the Boogiepop light novel series by Kouhei Kadono, particularly that of Boogiepop and Others and Boogiepop At Dawn. The series is directed by Takashi Watanabe, from a screenplay by Sadayuki Murai, with original character designs by novel illustrator Kouji Ogata, and sound direction by Yota Tsuruoka.
The story takes place in an unnamed Japanese city, a month after a pillar of light appeared in the night sky and five years after a string of serial killings. Boogiepop Phantom follows an ensemble cast of characters, mostly high school students, who are witnesses to the incident and its consequences. At the time of the series, high school students have started to disappear again and the blame is placed on Boogiepop, an urban legend who is said to be the personification of Death.
Each episode centers on different characters who sometimes have just a short involvement in the major events of the series. For this reason, many scenes are seen twice, from different perspectives, and some episodes are out of sequence, although there is a slow general time progression. An unusual visual style is employed wherein, for all but the last episode, a much reduced color palette is used in conjunction with a vignette effect. The sound design consists of synthesized avant-garde music carried by a leitmotif in the form of an active sonar pulse.[tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=Lesley|title=Boogiepop: The Ultimate Guide (Part 2 of 4)|publisher=Seven Seas Entertainment|date=2006-02-14|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/boogiepop_02.php|accessdate=2007-06-13[/tpl] Through the non-linear style of the series, the characters are used to develop the central themes of the series: Change, Escapism, Memory, and Relationships.
Boogiepop Phantom aired from January 5, 2000, to March 22, 2000, on TV Tokyo. The series is licensed in North America and Europe by Right Stuf International and distributed by ADV Films on DVD and VHS.

[[Greater Antilles]]

CATEGORIES: Greater Antilles

The Greater Antilles are one of the island groups in the Caribbean Sea. Comprising the islands of Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Hispaniola (containing the Dominican Republic and Haiti), Puerto Rico, and Jamaica, the Greater Antilles constitute over 94% of the land mass of the entire West Indies,Encyclopædia Britannica as well as over 90% of its population. The other island group in the archipelago is the Lesser Antilles, a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America).  
The word Antilles originated in the period before the European conquest of the New World - Europeans used the term Antilia as one of the mysterious lands featured on medieval charts, sometimes as an archipelago, sometimes as continuous land of greater or lesser extent, its location fluctuating in mid-ocean between the Canary Islands and India.

Although the best voiceband modems are called 56 kbit/s modems, downstream speeds can be limited to a few tens of kilobits per second with even lower upstream speeds. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and cable modems, two popular Internet access technologies, greatly improved downstream speeds reaching several Mbit/s. Mobile broadband and satellite Internet access providers also often have lower upstream speeds than downstream.
One process sending data primarily in the downstream direction is "downloading". However, the overall download speed depends on the downstream speed of the user, the upstream speed of the server, and the network between them.
In the client–server model, downstream can refer to the direction from the server to the client.

In software development, upstream  refers to a direction toward the original authors or maintainers of software that is distributed as source code, and is a qualification of either a bug or a patch. For example, a patch sent upstream is offered to the original authors or maintainers of the software. If accepted, the authors or maintainers will include the patch in their software, either immediately or in a future release. If rejected, the person who submitted the patch will have to maintain his or her own distribution of the author's software.

Robert Thurston ("Bob") Dart (3 September 1921 – 6 March 1971), was a British musicologist, conductor and keyboard player. From 1964 he was Professor of Music at King's College London.
He studied keyboard instruments at the Royal College of Music in London from 1938 to 1939, and also studied mathematics at University College, Exeter (B.Sc. 1942). In 1947 he was appointed assistant lecturer in music at the University of Cambridge, subsequently lecturer (1952), and professor (1962). During this time at Cambridge, Dart was the most effective British supporter of the modern early music revival, in part through his influence on those who ultimately formed such groups as the Early Music Consort of London. In 1964 he was appointed King Edward Professor of Music in the University of London (King's College).
As a continuo player he made numerous appearances on the harpsichord, and made many harpsichord, clavichord and organ recordings, especially for the L'Oiseau-Lyre label; he was also a conductor. He served as editor of the Galpin Society Journal from 1947 to 1954 and secretary of Musica Britannica from 1950 to 1965. His book, The Interpretation of Music (London, 1954), was highly influential; he also wrote numerous seminal articles on aspects of musical sources, performance and interpretation.
In the 1950s he participated in annual concerts featuring four harpsichordists, the three others being George Malcolm, Denis Vaughan and Eileen Joyce. In 1957 this group also recorded two of Vivaldi's Concertos for Four Harpsichords, one in a Bach arrangement, with the Pro Arte Orchestra under Boris Ord.  They also recorded Malcolm's Variations on a Theme of Mozart.Eileen Joyce (1908-1991) Timeline
Dart's distinguished students included the composer Michael Nyman, conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner and conductor/musicologist Christopher Hogwood.
He made one of the first historically informed recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos with the Philomusica of London. He later worked with Neville Marriner on a recording of both the Brandenburg Concerti and the four Orchestral suites though Dart died before this was complete.

Henri Frenay Sandoval (1905-1988) was a French military officer and French resistance member.
Henri Frenay was born in Lyon, France on 11 November 1905, into a Catholic family with a military tradition. He studied the Germanic languages at the University of Strasbourg.  Afterwards he became a soldier like his father and studied in Saint Cyr and l'Ecole Superieure de Guerre and reached the rank of captain in 1934.  At the outbreak of World War II, he rejoined the French army. German forces captured him in Vosges. He escaped from a POW camp in Alsace on 27 June 1940 and made his way to Marseille.
At first Frenay supported the Vichy Regime but was soon disillusioned by the Nazi tendency of the Pétain regime, and he subsequently formed the French Resistance group Mouvement de Liberation Nationale in 1940.  He became an editor of underground newspapers like Verités ([tpl]Lang-en|Truths[/tpl]) and had a hand in the formation of the Combat group in November, 1941.  In 1943 his group participated in the forming of the Conseil National de la Résistance of Jean Moulin but Frenay refused a seat due to a disagreement over the admission of political parties to the Counseil. 
When the Gestapo captured Jean Moulin, Frenay fled to Algiers. In November 1943 he met De Gaulle who appointed him as a minister of prisoners, refugees and deportees. 
After the war, Frenay served in De Gaulle's first provisional government.  Afterwards he retired from the political life and became a businessman.  He published his autobiography, The Night Will End: Memoirs of a Revolutionary in 1976. 
Henri Frenay died at Porto Vecchio, Corsica on August 8, 1988.

Blackburn Rovers Football Club [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|l|æ|k|b|ɜr|n|_|ˈ|r|oʊ|v|ər|z[/tpl] is an English professional association football club based in the town of Blackburn, Lancashire. The team competes in the Football League Championship from the 2012–13 season. They were relegated from the Premier League, the top tier of English football, at the end of the 2011–12 season. The club are currently managed by Gary Bowyer after previous manager Michael Appleton was dismissed on 19 March 2013. Appleton was the third manager to have lost his job in 6 months after Steve Kean and Henning Berg.
The club was established in 1875, becoming a founding member of The Football League in 1888. It is one of only three clubs to have been both a founder member of the Football League and the Premier League (the others being Aston Villa and Everton). In 1890 Rovers moved to its permanent home at Ewood Park. Prior to the formation of the Premier League in 1992, most of the club's successes were before 1930, when it had gained league and FA Cup trophies on several occasions. Relegation in 1965–66 was followed by 26 successive seasons of football outside the top flight.
In 1992, Blackburn gained promotion to the new Premier League a year after being taken over by local steel baron Jack Walker, who installed Kenny Dalglish as manager. In 1995, Blackburn became Premier League champions, having spent millions of pounds on players like Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton. However, the title-winning team was quickly split up and, in the 1998–99 season, the club was relegated. It was promoted back to the Premier League two years later, in the 2000–01 season, just after Walker's death. During this time it has qualified for the UEFA Cup four times: once as League Cup winners, twice as the Premier League's sixth-placed team and once via the Intertoto Cup. The 2009–10 season marked the club's 72nd non-consecutive year in the top flight. Blackburn are currently one of only five clubs to have won the Premier League, along with Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, and Manchester City.
The club's motto is "Arte et Labore", which the club translates as "By Skill and Hard Work" in Latin.

John Henry "Doc" Holliday (August 14, 1851 – November 8, 1887) was an American gambler, gunfighter, and dentist of the American Old West who is usually remembered for his friendship with Wyatt Earp and his involvement in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.
As a young man, Holliday earned a D.D.S. degree from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery and set up a dental practice in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1873 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15. He moved to the American Southwest in hopes that the climate would prolong his life. Taking up gambling as a profession, he subsequently acquired a reputation as a deadly gunman. During his travels, he met and became a good friend of Wyatt Earp and his brothers. In 1880, he moved to Tombstone, Arizona, and participated alongside the Earps in the famous gunfight at the OK Corral.
The gunfight did not occur at the OK Corral, but in a vacant lot owned by CS Fly, located between the CS Fly photography Studio and the Harwood house along Fremont Street. This did not settle matters between the two sides, and Holliday was embroiled in ensuing shootouts and killings. He successfully fought being extradited for murder and died in bed at a Colorado hotel at the age of 36.
The legend and mystique of his life is so great that he has been mentioned in countless books and portrayed by various actors in numerous movies and television series. For the 125-plus years since his death, debate has continued about the exact crimes he may have committed. It is believed that Holliday had killed between three to seven men in his lifetime, and has been to nine shootouts.Roberts (2006) p.415Walter Noble Burns in Tombstone : An Illiad of the Southwest, placed the fatalities as three

Highway 407 (pronounced "four-oh-seven"), officially known as the 407 Express Toll Route (ETR), is a privately operated 400-series highway and tollway in the Canadian province of Ontario.  Despite being included as part of the 400-series network, Highway 407 is not part of the provincial highway network.http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_98h28_e.htm#BK14 Highway 407 Act, 1998, Sections 12(1) and 12(2) It begins at the junction of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) and Highway 403 in Burlington, and travels [tpl]convert|107.2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] northeast and east to its present terminus at Highway 7 and Brock Road (Durham Regional Road 1) in Pickering. Plans are underway to extend the highway further east through Durham Region to Highway 35/115 near Orono as a provincially maintained highway.
Leased to a private consortium in 1999, Highway 407 was formerly planned as a 400-series freeway to bypass the Toronto segment of Highway 401, the busiest highway in North America.[ref]
</ref>
Major freeway junctions with Highway 407 are located at (from west to east) the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), Highways 403, 401, 410, 427, 400, and 404. Other major street junctions include Bronte Road (Halton Regional Road 25, formerly Highway 25), Hurontario Street (formerly Highway 10), Highway 27, Yonge Street (formerly Highway 11) and Markham Road (formerly Highway 48). In all, there are 40 different junctions on Highway 407 connecting the toll road with the main transportation network in the Greater Toronto Area.
Highway 407 is the first electronically operated toll highway opened in the world; there are no toll booths along the length of the highway. Transponders or licence plates are read at entrance and exit points and distances calculated electronically. Drivers are mailed their bill several days later. The tolls on the highway have generated considerable controversy since the highway opened, as well as a lawsuit brought on by the province.
The 407 is operated privately under a 99-year lease agreement with the provincial government. The lease was sold to a consortium of Canadian, Spanish and Australian interests operating under the name 407 International Inc. for approximately $3.1 billion in 1999. The company is owned by Cintras Infraestructuras S.A., a subsidiary of Ferrovial S.A, and partially owned by subsidiaries of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Montreal-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

[[State of emergency]]

CATEGORIES: Constitutional law, Emergency laws, Emergency management, Government, Inclement weather management, Law enforcement

A state of emergency is a governmental declaration that announces that the country is in a state of emergency. This means that the government can suspend and/or change some functions of the executive, the legislative and or the judiciary during this period of time.  It alerts citizens to change their normal behaviour and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. A government can declare a state of emergency during a time of natural or man-made disaster, during a period of civil unrest, or following a declaration of war or situation of international/internal armed conflict. Justitium is its equivalent in Roman law.
It can also be used as a rationale for suspending rights and freedoms, even if those rights and freedoms are guaranteed under the Constitution. Some countries do not have an embedded Constitution such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Israel. Legislation covers a state of emergency in these countries. Under the protocol of the ICCPR, rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency, for example, a government can detain citizens and hold them without trial. All rights that can be derogated from are listed in the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. Some sources argue that non-derogable rights cannot be suspended.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl]D.

Emergency law does and can override non-derogatory rights during a state of emergency.Judson, A.-M. (2012). Where is R2P grounded in International law? (Thesis, Master of Arts). University of Otago. Retrieved from http://hdl.handle.net/10523/2279
Some countries have made it illegal to modify emergency law or the constitution during the emergency, other countries have the freedom to change any legislation or rights based constitutional frameworks, at any time that the legislative chooses to do so. Constitutions are contracts between the individual government and the citizens of that Country. The International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is an international law document signed by states.  Therefore the Covenant only applies to states not citizens. However signatories to the Covenant are expected to integrate it into national legislation. The state of emergency (within the ICCPR framework) must be publicly declared and the Secretary-General of the United Nations must be contacted immediately, to declare the reason for the emergency, the date on which the emergency is to start, the derogations that may take place, with the timeframe of the emergency and the date in which the emergency is expected to finish. Although this is common protocol stipulated by the ICCPR often this is not strictly followed.

In electrocardiography, the ventricular myocyte membrane potential is about −90 mV at rest, which is close to the potassium reversal potential. When an action potential is generated, the membrane potential rises above this level in four distinct phases.
The beginning of the action potential, phase 0, specialized membrane proteins (voltage-gated sodium channels) in the cell membrane selectively allow sodium ions to enter the cell. This causes the membrane potential to rise at a rate of about 300 V/s. As the membrane voltage rises (to about 40 mV) sodium channels close due to a process called inactivation.
The Na+ channel opening is followed by inactivation. Na+ inactivation comes with slowly activating Ca2+ channels at the same time as a few fast K+ channels open. There is a balance between the outward flow of K+ and the inward flow of Ca2+ causing a plateau of length in variables. The delayed opening of more Ca2+-activated K+ channels, which are activated by build-up of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm, while the Ca2+ channels close, ends the plateau. This leads to repolarisation.
The depolarization of the membrane allows calcium channels to open as well. As sodium channels close calcium provides current to maintain the potential around 20 mV. The plateau lasts on the order of 100 ms. At the time that calcium channels are getting activated, channels that mediate the transient outward potassium current open as well. This outward potassium current causes a small dip in membrane potential shortly after depolarization. This current is observed in human and dog action potentials, but not in guinea pig action potentials.
Repolarization is accomplished by channels that open slowly and are mostly activated at the end of the action potential (slow delayed-rectifier channels), and channels that open quickly but are inactivated until the end of the action potential (rapid delayed rectifier channels). Fast delayed rectifier channels open quickly but are shut by inactivation at high membrane potentials. As the membrane voltage begins to drop the channels recover from inactivation and carry current.

San Gimignano is a small walled medieval hill town in the province of Siena, Tuscany, north-central Italy. Known as the Town of Fine Towers, San Gimignano is famous for its medieval architecture, unique in the preservation of about a dozen of its tower houses,The exact number is not a matter of agreement because many towers have been levelled to the same height as adjacent buildings. The number is given as "a dozen" (Strasser), 13 (Vantaggi) and 14 (UNESCO). which, with its hilltop setting and encircling walls form "an unforgettable skyline".   Within the walls, the well-preserved buildings include notable examples of both Romanesque and Gothic architecture, with outstanding examples of secular buildings as well as churches. The Palazzo Comunale, the Collegiate Church and Church of Sant' Agostino contain frescos, including cycles dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. The "Historic Centre of San Gimignano", is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.UNESCO: Historic Centre of San Gimignano, (accessed 05-09-2012)
The town also is known for the white wine, Vernaccia di San Gimignano, produced from the ancient variety of Vernaccia grape which is grown on the sandstone hillsides of the area.Tuscany Wine, (accessed 11-09-2012)Vernaccia di San Gimignano, (accessed 11-09-2012)

Gorizia [tpl]audio|It-Gorizia.ogg|listen[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-de|Görz[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sl|Gorica[/tpl]) is a town and comune in northeastern Italy, in the autonomous region of Friuli Venezia Giulia. It is located at the foot of the Julian Alps, bordering Slovenia. It is the capital of the Province of Gorizia and a local center of tourism, industry, and commerce. Since 1947, a twin town of Nova Gorica has developed on the other side of the modern-day Italian-Slovenian border: the entire region was subject to territorial dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia during the period of early development, by the time the boundaries were marked and agreed by both parties, Nova Gorica came to stand on the Yugoslav side. Taken together the towns constitute a conurbation, which also includes the Slovenian municipality of Šempeter-Vrtojba. Since May 2011, these three towns are joined in a common trans-border metropolitan zone, administered by a joint administration board.[tpl]cite web|author=di Francesco Fain |url=http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/cronaca/2011/05/12/news/patto-gorizia-nova-gorica-c-e-la-firma-1.56599 |title=Patto Gorizia-Nova Gorica c-e la firma - Cronaca|publisher= Il Piccolo|language=Italian|date= |accessdate=2012-08-25[/tpl]
Gorizia is located at the confluence of the Isonzo and Vipava Valleys. It lies on a plain overlooked by the Collio hills, which are renowned for the production of outstanding wines. Sheltered from the north by a mountain ridge, Gorizia is protected from the cold Bora wind that affects most of the neighbouring areas. The town thus enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate throughout the year, making it a popular resort.
The name of the town comes from the Slovene word [tpl]lang|sl|gorica[/tpl] meaning "little hill", which is a very common toponym in Slovene-inhabited areas.

It was formed by the union of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA), often referred to (inaccurately[tpl]According to whom|date=January 2012[/tpl]) as the "Northern" Presbyterian Church, with the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA), a smaller church of Covenanter-Seceder tradition at a conference in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in May 1958. Vigorous ecumenical activity on the part of PCUSA leaders led to this merger, something of a reunion of two long-separated branches of the larger Presbyterian family deriving from the British Isles.

Although born in Austria, and brought up in Italy and Germany, he enrolled in the United Kingdom's Royal Navy at the age of fourteen. Queen Victoria and her son King Edward VII, when Prince of Wales, occasionally intervened in his career: the Queen thought that there was "a belief that the Admiralty are afraid of promoting Officers who are Princes on account of the radical attacks of low papers and scurrilous ones".Queen Victoria to First Lord of the Admiralty Lord George Hamilton, 5 September 1891, Royal Archives E5 6/45 However, Louis welcomed battle assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that he was serious about his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours arranged by the Queen and Edward actually impeded his progress, as his promotions were perceived as royal favours rather than deserved.[tpl]citation|first=Richard|last=Hough|authorlink=Richard Hough|title=Louis and Victoria: The Family History of the Mountbattens.

After a naval career lasting more than forty years, in 1912 he was appointed First Sea Lord, the professional head of the British naval service. With World War I looming, he took steps to ready the British fleet for combat, but his background as a German prince forced his retirement once the war began, when anti-German sentiment was running high. He changed his name and relinquished his German titles, at the behest of King George V, in 1917.
He married a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, and was the father of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, who also served as First Sea Lord from 1954 to 1959. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Queen Elizabeth II, is his grandson.

The Witwatersrand is a 56 km long north facing scarp in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. It consists of a hard, erosion resistant quartzite sedimentary rock, over which several north-flowing rivers form waterfalls, which account for the name “Witwatersrand” meaning the “ridge of white waters” in Afrikaans.Truswell, J.F. (1977). ‘’The Geological Evolution of South Africa’’. p. 21, 27-28, 33-36, . Purnell, Cape Town.  This east-west running scarp can be traced with only one short gap from Bedfordview (about 10 km west of O.R. Tambo International Airport) in the east, through Johannesburg and Roodepoort, to Krugersdorp in the west (see the diagram bottom-left below).Norman, N., Whitfield, G. (2006) ‘’Geological Journeys’’. p. 38-49, 60-61. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.
The scarp forms the northern edge of a 7–10 km wide plateau (or ridge) which rises about 200 m above the surrounding plains of the Highveld. The entire plateau-like structure is also often called the “Witwatersrand”. The plateau’s elevation above sea-level is between 1700–1800 m.
The Witwatersrand plateau forms a continental divide with the run-off to the north draining into the Indian Ocean via the  Crocodile and Limpopo Rivers, while the run-off to the south drains via the Vaal into the Orange River and ultimately into the Atlantic Ocean.’’Encyclopaedia Britannica’’ (1975).  Micropaedia Vol. X. p. 720. Helen Hemingway Benton, Chicago.
The Witwatersrand lies within the province of Gauteng, formerly called the “PWV”, an acronym for Pretoria, "Witwatersrand" and Vereeniging. When used in this latter context, the term Witwatersrand refers to the entire Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area. This conurbation is oblong in shape and runs from Springs in the east to Randfontein and Carletonville in the west, as well as Soweto to the south. This area is also often colloquially referred to as “the Rand” or “Wits”.
Because of the extraordinary quantities of gold that have been extracted from the Witwatersrand rocks, the South African currency was named the “Rand” in 1961.

[[Gondola lift]]

CATEGORIES: Aerial lifts, Ski lift types, Vertical transport devices, Gondola lifts

A gondola lift, also called a cable car, is a type of aerial lift which is supported and propelled by cables from above. It consists of a loop of steel cable that is strung between two stations, sometimes over intermediate supporting towers. The cable is driven by a bullwheel in a terminal, which is typically connected to an engine or electric motor. They are often considered continuous systems since they feature a haul rope which continuously moves and circulates around two terminal stations.Cable Propelled Systems in Urban Environments Edward S. Neumann - Retrieved on 2010-08-05 Depending on the combination of cables used for support and/or haulage and the type of grip (detachable grip vs. fixed grip), the capacity, cost, and functionality of a gondola lift will differ dramatically. Because of the proliferation of such systems in the Alpine regions of Europe, the French language name of Télécabine is also used in an English language context. 
Gondola lifts should not be confused with aerial tramways as the latter solely operates with fixed grips and simply shuttles back and forth between two end terminals.

[[Body integrity identity disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Abnormal psychology, Amputations, Identity disorders, Sexology

Body integrity identity disorder (BIID, also referred to as amputee identity disorder[tpl]cite doi | 10.1383/psyt.3.8.27.43394 [/tpl]) is a psychological disorder wherein sufferers feel they would be happier living as an amputee. It is related to xenomelia, "the oppressive feeling that one or more limbs of one's body do not belong to oneself".[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/brain/aws316[/tpl]
BIID is typically accompanied by the desire to amputate one or more healthy limbs to achieve that end.  BIID can be associated with apotemnophilia, sexual arousal based on the image of one's self as an amputee. The cause of BIID is unknown.  One theory states that the cause of BIID is a neurological failing of the brain's inner body mapping function (located in the right parietal lobe).  According to this theory, the brain mapping does not incorporate the affected limb in its understanding of the body's physical form.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

[[Ionian Revolt]]

CATEGORIES: 5th-century BC conflicts, Ionian Revolt, Revolts in Greek Antiquity, Battles involving the Achaemenid Empire, Wars involving ancient Greece, Wars involving Athens, Wars involving Cyprus, Ionia

The Ionian Revolt, and associated revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus and Caria, were military rebellions by several regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 BC to 493 BC. At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, Histiaeus and Aristagoras. The cities of Ionia had been conquered by Persia around 540 BC, and thereafter were ruled by native tyrants, nominated by the Persian satrap in Sardis. In 499 BC, the then tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.
In 498 BC, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they were followed by Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion, but the spread of the revolt to Caria meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there. While initially campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC.
By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and they made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but were decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade, after the defection of the Samians. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was brought under Persian rule. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was generally considered to be both just and fair.
The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, according to Herodotus, Darius decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, would begin as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.

[[Clapham Park]]
CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Lambeth

Clapham Park is an area in the Borough of Lambeth in London, to the south of central Clapham and west of Brixton. The original Clapham Park Estate was a speculative development by Thomas Cubitt, who bought [tpl]convert|229|acre|km2[/tpl] of Bleak Hall Farm in 1825, and marked out plots for building around the new, broad, tree-lined streets of Kings Avenue, Clarence Avenue, Poynders Road and Atkins Road.   The estate was planned to consist of large detached houses in Cubitt's characteristic Italianate villa style, with each house set in extensive grounds. However, Cubitt's ambitions were never fulfilled, and some plots remained undeveloped at the outbreak of World War I.  Cubitt's own residence, Lincoln House, was demolished in 1905, and Rodenhurst Road, a street of large, double-fronted, semi-detached Edwardian houses, was laid out on the site.  British statesman Arthur Henderson once lived at number 13 and there is a Blue Plaque on the house indicating this. With the adoption of Poynders Road as the arterial "South Circular" road, this area is now severed from the area further south by traffic, and the streets south of Poynders Road are not generally referred to as being part of Clapham Park.

The Cerro Maravilla murders, also known as the Cerro Maravilla massacre,Artistas buscan emular a Campeche. Ely Acevedo Denis. Noticel. 4 February 2011. Retrieved 3 July 2012. is the name given by the Puerto Rican public and media to describe the events that occurred on July 25, 1978, at Cerro Maravilla, a mountain in Puerto Rico, wherein two young Puerto Rican pro-independence activists were murdered in a Puerto Rico Police ambush. The event sparked a series of political controversies where, in the end, the police officers were found guilty of murder and several high-ranking local government officials were accused of planning and/or covering-up the incident.
Originally declared a police intervention against terrorists, the local media quickly questioned the officers' testimonies as well as the only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Although reluctant, Carlos Romero Barceló, then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Justice Department to aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officer's part. However, after the local opposing political party launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.
The incident and subsequent events have become one of the most controversial events in Puerto Rico's political history, frequently called "the worst political cover-up in the history of the island."Shining Star Pedro Alberto Vera.  2007. Page 77. Retrieved 3 July 2012. The event is often used by Puerto Rican independence activists as an example of political oppression against the Puerto Rican independence movement.

[[Spitting spider]]

CATEGORIES: Scytodidae

Spitting spiders are members of the family Scytodidae. There are several genera, of which Scytodes is the best-known. Over 150 species of scytodids have been described worldwide. This means that the Scytodes is somewhat related to the family Sicariidae commonly known as Recluse spiders being that they are part of the same superfamily.
Scytodidae catch their prey by spitting a fluid that congeals on contact into a venomous and sticky mass.  Remarkably, though it is produced in venom glands in the chelicerae, the fluid contains both venom and spider silk in liquid form. The venom-impregnated silk not only immobilizes prey such as Silverfish by tying it down, but has a venomous effect as well. In high-speed moving pictures, the spiders can be observed swaying from side to side as they "spit", catching the prey in a crisscrossed "Z" pattern; it is criss-crossed because each of the chelicerae emits half of the pattern. The spider usually strikes from a distance of 10–20 mm and the whole attack sequence is over in a little under 1/700th of a second.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. After making the capture, the spider will typically bite the prey with venomous effect, and wrap it in the normal spider fashion with silk from the spinnerets.Gilbert, C. and L. S . Rayor . 1985 . Predatory behavior of spitting spiders (Araneae, Scytodidae) and the evolution of prey wrapping. J . Arachnol., 13 :231-241
Like the Sicariidae and Diguetidae these spiders are haplogyne (lack hardened female genitalia) and have six eyes, which are arranged as three pairs.  The Scytodidae differ from the Sicariidae and Diguetidae in having a dome-shaped carapace and in their characteristic flecked pattern of spots.
When two scytodes happen to fight each other, the larger one generally is strong enough to break free from the web of the smaller, and thereby to win.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqb30-YjYoY&feature=related However, at least some species exhibit presocial behaviour, in which mature spiders live together and assist the young with food.Miller, Jeremy. 2010.

CATEGORIES: Entertainment, Visual music, Laser image generation, Laser art

A laser lighting display or laser light show involves the use of  laser light to entertain an audience.  A laser light show may consist only of projected laser beams set to music, or may accompany another form of entertainment, typically musical performances.
Laser light is useful in entertainment because the coherent nature of laser light allows a narrow beam to be produced, which allows the use of optical scanning to draw patterns or images on walls, ceilings or other surfaces including theatrical smoke and fog without refocusing for the differences in distance, as is common with video projection. This inherently more focused beam is also extremely visible, and is often used as an effect.  Sometimes the beams are "bounced" to different positions with mirrors to create laser sculptures.

Ancient is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen, formed in 1992. The band released six full-length albums released by Metal Blade Records to date and a variety of mini-albums, EPs and special releases. Ancient used to have the classic raw black metal sound, similar to Darkthrone's works. Beginning with The Cainian Chronicle, they moved towards a more Nordic/atmospheric black metal sound, akin to Emperor and a cleaner production. After a period of turmoil concerning their line-up, they went on to add gothic-style instruments such as violins, a female vocalist, and synthesizers to their music.
To this day Ancient can be considered as one of the original Norwegian black metal bands that were part of the now famous scene of the early nineties. They were one of the very first Norwegian black metal bands to sign for a semi-major label (Metal Blade Records). There is no evidence of any involvement of Ancient with the infamous occurrences of the Norwegian black metal scene, although they were part of the same scene. Ancient can be considered as a historical black metal act by all standards, whose path took a different course upon their relocation around the world and subsequent exit from the local Norwegian scene.

Gifted in languages, he spoke six and was the first Puerto Rican to graduate from Harvard Law School; graduating with the highest grade point average in his law class, an achievement that earned him the right to give the valedictorian speech at his graduation ceremony. However, animus towards his mixed racial heritage would lead to his professors delaying two of his final exams in order to keep Albizu Campos from graduating on time."Juramentación de Pedro Albizu Campos como Abogado: Regreso de Harvard a Puerto Rico", La Voz de la Playa de Ponce, Edición 132, November 2010.

He was imprisoned twenty-six years for attempting to overthrow the United States government in Puerto Rico.
In 1950, he planned and called for armed uprisings in several cities in Puerto Rico on behalf of independence. Afterward he was convicted and imprisoned again. He died in 1965 shortly after his pardon and release from federal prison, some time after suffering a stroke. There is controversy over his medical treatment in prison.

[[Complete contract]]

CATEGORIES: Contract law

A  complete contract is an important concept from contract theory.  
If the parties to an agreement could specify their respective rights and duties for every possible future state of the world, their contract would be complete.  There would be no gaps in the terms of the contract. 
However, because it would be prohibitively expensive to write a complete contract, contracts in the real world are usually incomplete. When a dispute arises and the case falls into a gap in the contract, either the parties must engage in bargaining or the courts must step in and fill in the gap. The idea of a complete contract is closely related to the notion of default rules, e.g. legal rules that will fill the gap in a contract in the absence of an agreed upon provision.

[[Stored-value card]]

A stored-value card refers to monetary value on a card not in an externally recorded account and differs from prepaid cards where money is on deposit with the issuer similar to a debit card.[tpl]cite book |title= Intro to Business|last1= Dlabay|first1= Les R. |last2=Burrow |first2=James L. |last3=Brad |first3= Brad |year= 2009|publisher= South-Western Cengage Learning|location= Mason, Ohio|isbn=978-0-538-44561-0 |page=433[/tpl]  One major difference between stored value cards and prepaid debit cards is that prepaid debit cards are usually issued in the name of individual account holders, while stored value cards are usually anonymous.
The term stored-value card means the funds and or data are metaphorically 'physically' stored on the card, in the form of binary-coded data. With prepaid cards the data is maintained on computers affiliated with the card issuer. The value associated with the card can be accessed using a magnetic stripe embedded in the card, on which the card number is encoded; using radio-frequency identification (RFID); or by entering a code number, printed on the card, into a telephone or other numeric keypad.

[[Joe's Garage]]

CATEGORIES: 1979 albums, Concept albums, Dystopian fiction, English-language albums, German-language albums, Frank Zappa albums, Rock operas, Zappa Records albums

Joe's Garage is a 1979 rock opera by Frank Zappa.  Zappa self-deprecatingly describes the album as a "stupid little story about how the government is going to do away with music."  Originally released as two separate studio albums on Zappa Records, the project was later remastered and reissued as a triple album box set, Joe's Garage, Acts I, II & III, in 1987.   The story is told by a character identified as the "Central Scrutinizer" narrating the story of Joe, an average adolescent male, who forms a garage rock band, has unsatisfying relationships with women, gives all of his money to a government assisted and insincere religion, explores sexual activities with appliances, and is imprisoned. After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized, he lapses into insanity.
The album encompasses a large spectrum of musical styles, while its lyrics often feature satirical or humorous commentary on American society and politics. It addresses themes of individualism, free will, censorship, the music industry and human sexuality, while criticizing government and religion, and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology. Joe's Garage is noted for its use of xenochrony, a recording technique that takes guitar solos from older live recordings and overdubs them onto new studio recordings.  All of the guitar solos on the album are xenochronous except for "Crew Slut" and "Watermelon in Easter Hay", a signature song that Zappa has described as the best song on the album, and according to his son Dweezil, the best guitar solo his father ever played.
The album initially received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising its innovative and original music, but criticizing the scatological, sexual and profane nature of the lyrics.  Since its original release, Joe's Garage has been reappraised as one of Zappa's best works.

CATEGORIES: Starting systems, Automobile maintenance

[tpl]About|a method of starting a vehicle with a discharged battery|other uses|Jump start (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Jump start[/tpl]
A jump start, also called a boost, is a method of starting a vehicle that is unable to be self-started due to insufficient power to the starter motor from a discharged starter battery (also known as an SLI battery). A temporary connection is made between the discharged battery's terminals and those of another running vehicle, or to some other external power source. When the connection is made, the external supply of current effectively bypasses the battery cells, passing directly into the vehicle's electrical system through the terminal connections and providing the current needed to operate the starter motor. Once the vehicle has been started (and barring any other malfunction in the electrical system), the vehicle's alternator will naturally recharge the battery over a running period ranging from 30 minutes to 3 hours.
The most common cause of accidentally discharged SLI batteries is leaving headlights or other electricity-consuming accessories in operation for too long while the engine is shut off, which eventually drains the charge below the level necessary to run the starter motor. Jump starts usually require a set of specialized heavy-gauge two-wire cables, known as jumper cables, with connectors designed to clip securely to both sets of battery terminals.

[[Effects of the automobile on societies]]

Over the course of the 20th century, the automobile rapidly developed from an expensive toy for the rich into the de facto standard for passenger transport in most developed countries.The ‘System’ of Automobility by John Urrey. Theory, Culture & Society, Vol. 21, No. 4-5, 25-39 (2004)  In developing countries, the effects of the automobile have lagged, but are emulating the impacts of developed nations.  The development of the automobile built upon the transport revolution started by railways, and like the railways, introduced sweeping changes in employment patterns, social interactions, infrastructure and goods distribution.
The effects of the automobile on everyday life have been a subject of controversy.  While the introduction of the mass-produced automobile represented a revolution in mobility and convenience, the modern consequences of heavy automotive use contribute to the use of non-renewable fuels, a dramatic increase in the rate of accidental death, social isolation, the disconnection of community, the rise in obesity, the generation of air and noise pollution,  urban sprawl, and urban decay.[ref]Asphalt Nation: how the automobile took over America, and how we can take it back By Jane Holtz Kay

[[Affine space]]
CATEGORIES: Affine geometry, Linear algebra

In mathematics, an affine space is a geometric structure that generalizes the affine properties of Euclidean space. In an affine space, there is no distinguished point that serves as an origin. Hence, no vector has a fixed origin and no vector can be uniquely associated to a point. One can subtract two points to get a vector, or add a vector to a point to get another point, but one cannot add points. 
The solution set of an inhomogeneous linear equation is either empty or an affine subspace. In particular, a point is a zero-dimensional affine subspace.

The act of taking an affine combination commutes with any affine transformation T in the sense that

[[Ghost mark]]

CATEGORIES: Trademark law

Ghost marks are trade marks which closely simulate ordinary words or phrases used in the course of trade, and which are not intended to be used as genuine trade marks.
In the case of Imperial Group v. Philip Morris 1982 FSR 72, the plaintiff endeavored to register the trade mark "MERIT" for cigarette products, but was unable to do so on the grounds that the trade mark was too descriptive. Instead, it registered the mark "NERIT", without any intention of using the mark, but in order to prevent other traders from using the mark "MERIT" because it would be considered too similar to the registered mark "NERIT". The intention was the obtain a de facto monopoly over the unregisterable mark "MERIT". 
The defendant began using the mark "MERIT" for cigarettes and was sued by the plaintiff for infringing its mark "NERIT".
The court struck down the registration for "NERIT" on the basis that the plaintiff had no genuine intention to use the mark (despite some "trivial and insubstantial" efforts at launching a NERIT-branded product).
Prior to the decision in Imperial Group, ghost marks were a commonplace tactical procedure for trade mark owners. Ghost marks are now rarely filed following this decision. A somewhat similar protection to that offered by ghost marks are available through the use of defensive trade marks.

The Canadian Government has said that the mission was completed on July 2005, although only 50,000 soldiers have been captured and integrated into civilian life. There are still an estimated 40,000 soldiers who are loyal to General Muhamod Fahim.
The first phase of the operation began July 1, 2003 and focused on Kunduz Province, Bamyan Province, and Khost Province.
The deputy chairman of the commission responsible for the disarmament program is Afghan Urban Development Minister Yousuf Pushtun. 
The senior DDR advisor from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is Sultan Aziz.
The total budget for the DDR process is estimated at US$200 million, of which only $41 million had been secured by phase one, including $35 million from the Japanese government.

[[IBM RS64]]

CATEGORIES: PowerPC microprocessors, IBM microprocessors

The IBM RS64 is a family of microprocessors that were used in the late 1990s in IBM's RS/6000 and AS/400 servers. 
These microprocessors implement the "Amazon", or "PowerPC-AS", instruction set architecture (ISA). Amazon is a subset of the PowerPC instruction set, with the addition of special features not in the PowerPC specification, mainly derived from POWER2 and the original AS/400 processor, and has been 64-bit from the start. The processors in this family are optimized for commercial workloads (integer performance, large caches, branches) and do not feature the strong floating point performance of the processors in the IBM POWER microprocessors family, its sibling. 
The RS64 family was phased out soon after the introduction of the POWER4, which was developed to unite the RS64 and POWER families.

He was the longest-serving and longest-lived Premier of Queensland,"Sir Joh celebrates 93rd birthday", Australian Broadcasting Corporation 13 January 2004. holding office from 1968 to 1987, during which time the state enjoyed considerable economic development."Sir Joh, our home-grown banana republican", The Age, 25 April 2005. His uncompromising conservatism (including his role in the downfall of the Whitlam federal government), his political longevity, and his leadership of a government that, in its later years, was revealed to be institutionally corrupt, made him one of the best-known and most controversial political figures of 20th century Australia.
Bjelke-Petersen's Country (later National) Party controlled Queensland despite consistently receiving the smallest number of votes out of the state's leading three parties, achieving the result through a notorious system of electoral malapportionment that resulted in rural votes having a greater value than those cast in city electorates.[tpl]cite book | last = Lunn | first =Hugh | authorlink =Hugh Lunn |  title = Joh: The Life and Political Adventures of Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen | publisher = University of Queensland Press|  edition =2nd  | year = 1987 | location =Brisbane | pages =119–123| isbn =0-7022-2087-6[/tpl]Peter Charlton, "Law and order the making of unlikely leader," The Courier-Mail, 25 April 2005, pg 25. Yet Bjelke-Petersen was a highly popular figure among conservative voters and over the course of his 19 years as premier he trebled the number of people who voted for his party and doubled the party's percentage vote, reducing his Liberal coalition partners to a mere six seats in the 1983 election. In 1985 Bjelke-Petersen launched a campaign to move into federal politics to become prime minister, though the campaign was eventually aborted.
Bjelke-Petersen was a divisive premier and earned himself a reputation as a "law and order" politician with his repeated use of police force against street demonstrators and strongarm tactics with trade unions, leading to frequent descriptions of Queensland under his leadership as a police state. From 1987 his administration came under the scrutiny of a royal commission into police corruption and its links with state government ministers; Bjelke-Petersen was unable to recover from the series of damaging findings and after initially resisting a party vote that replaced him as leader, resigned from politics on 1 December 1987. Two of his state ministers, as well as the police commissioner Bjelke-Petersen had appointed and later knighted, were jailed for corruption offences and in 1991 Bjelke-Petersen, too, was tried for perjury over his evidence to the royal commission; the jury failed to reach a verdict and Bjelke-Petersen was deemed too old to face a second trial.

CATEGORIES: Film production companies of the United Kingdom, Merchant Ivory Productions films, Companies established in 1961

Merchant Ivory Productions is a film company founded in 1961 by  producer Ismail Merchant (d. 2005) and director James Ivory. Their films were for the most part produced by Merchant, directed by Ivory, and 23 (of the 44 total films) were scripted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (d. 2013). The films were often based upon novels or short stories, particularly the work of Henry James, E. M. Forster, and two novels by Jhabvala herself.
The initial goal of the company was "to make English-language films in India aimed at the international market," but the company ended up making many films set in England and America. 
Some actors and producers associated with Merchant Ivory include Leela Naidu, Madhur Jaffrey, Aparna Sen, Shashi Kapoor, Jennifer Kendal, Hugh Grant, James Wilby, Rupert Graves, Simon Callow, Anthony Hopkins, Glenn Close, Uma Thurman, Emma Thompson, Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson, Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter.
Of this collaboration, Merchant once commented: "It is a strange marriage we have at Merchant Ivory... I am an Indian Muslim, Ruth is a German Jew, and Jim is a Protestant American. Someone once described us as a three-headed god. Maybe they should have called us a three-headed monster!""Ismail Merchant", The Times, 26 May 2005. 
The expression "Merchant-Ivory film" has made its way into common parlance, to denote a particular genre of film rather than the actual production company.  While 1965's Shakespeare Wallah put this genre on the international map,Kaur, Harmanpreet. "The Wandering Company: Merchant-Ivory Productions and Post-Colonial Cinema", Projectorhead Film Magazine, 10 Jan 2013. its heyday was the 1980s and 1990s with such films as A Room with a View and Howards End.  A typical "Merchant-Ivory film" would be a period piece set in the early 20th century, usually in Edwardian England, featuring lavish sets and top British actors portraying genteel characters who suffer from disillusionment and tragic entanglements.LaSalle, Mick.

CATEGORIES: Cat breeds, Cat breeds originating in Thailand, Rare cat breeds

Korats ([tpl]lang-th|โคราช, มาเลศ, สีสวาด[/tpl], [tpl]RTGS|Khorat, Malet, Sisawat[/tpl]) are a slate blue-grey short-haired breed of domestic cat with a small to medium build and a low percentage of body fat. Their bodies are semi-cobby, and surprisingly heavy for their size. They are intelligent, playful, active cats and form strong bonds with people. Among Korats' distinguishing characteristics are their heart-shaped heads and large green eyes. They are one of a few breeds where individuals have only one color.
The Korat is a natural breed, and one of the oldest stable cat breeds. Originating in Thailand, it is named after the Nakhon Ratchasima province (typically called "Korat" by the Thai people). In Thailand the breed is known as Si-Sawat, meaning "color of the sawat seed".  They are known colloquially as the "good luck cat" and are given in pairs to newlyweds or to people who are highly esteemed, for good luck. Until recently, Korats were not sold, but only given as gifts.
The modern Korats now exist due to the diligent efforts of a few breeders inside and outside of Thailand.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
The probable first allusion to the breed is in the Thai Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems), authored between 1350 and 1767 AD and now in the national library in Bangkok. However, the illustration of the Korat in this book is not detailed enough to be definitive as to the breed portrayed. In recent years the Korat was on postage stamp in Thailand. An example hangs in the city of Korat's post office.
Korats first appeared in Britain under the name "Blue Siamese" in 1889 and 1896, but as these solid blue cats did not conform to the cat show judges' perception of a Siamese cat they disappeared by 1901.  One early import, "Dwina", owned by Russian Blue breeder Mrs Constance Carew-Cox and mentioned in Frances Simpson's The Book of the Cat (1903), reputedly produced a large number of "Siamese" kittens; the other, Mrs B. Spearman's Blue Siamese male, "Nam Noi", was disqualified as a Siamese, but accepted in the Russian or Any Other Blue class in which he placed first (WR Hawkins, "Around the Pens" July 1896). Spearman tried unsuccessfully to import more of these "Blue Siamese".[tpl]cite web|last=Lacey|first=Jen|title=Was this the first Korat to be shown?|url=http://www.koratworld.com/namnoi.html|publisher=KoratWorld|accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl]
Korats first appeared in America in the 1950s. In 1959, Cedar Glen cattery was the first to import a pair of Korats to the US for breeding: a male named Nara and a female named Darra.[tpl]cite web|last=Coleman|first=Cheryl|title=The Korat|url=http://www.cfa.org/client/korat.aspx|publisher=The Cat Fanciers' Association, Inc.|accessdate=4 January 2013[/tpl]  The Korat was introduced to the UK by Betty Munford of the High Street, Hungerford.[tpl]inconsistent[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Although it is rare, Korats occasionally have striking or faint white markings or spots or even very faint gray stripes. Sometimes these spots increase in size with age. These are seen as flaws, and the cats are not allowed to be displayed in cat shows, although, of course, it has no effect on their personality or health.

Nurmijärvi ([tpl]IPA-fi|ˈnurmiˌjærʋi[/tpl]) is the most populated rural municipality of Finland, located [tpl]convert|37|km[/tpl] north of the capital Helsinki.
The close proximity to Helsinki has led to a considerable growth of the major villages such as Klaukkala and Rajamäki, which nowadays are considered dormitory towns of Helsinki. Klaukkala is the biggest built-up area of Nurmijärvi.
Nurmijärvi literally means "lawn lake" although the lake that gave the municipality its name was drained in the early 20th century and is now nothing more than some flat fields near the village centre.
Nurmijärvi is best known as the birthplace of Finland's national author, Aleksis Kivi (1834–1872). His play Nummisuutarit (The Cobblers of the Heath) – with colourful scenes of rural life in the 19th century Nurmijärvi parish – are performed in summer at an outdoor theatre in Palojoki, the village where Kivi was born.

The Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913 (also known as the "Cat and Mouse Act") was an Act of Parliament passed in Britain under Herbert Henry Asquith's Liberal government in 1913. Suffragettes who were undertaking hunger strikes at the time would now be released from prison as soon as they became ill. The strikes themselves were now technically legal. However, the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges. The nickname of the Act came about because of a cat’s habit of playing with its prey (a mouse) before finishing it off.

CATEGORIES: Peptide hormone secreting cells, Stomach

Delta cells (δ-cells or D cells) are somatostatin-producing cells. 
They can be found in the stomach, intestine and the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.  
In rodents, delta-cells are located in the periphery of the islets; in humans the islet architecture is generally less organized and delta-cells are frequently observed inside the islets as well. 
In the electron microscope, delta-cells can be identified as cells with smaller and slightly more compact granules than beta cells.
D cells contain CCKBR (which respond to gastrin) and M3 receptors (which respond to Ach). Respectively, these receptors will increase somatostatin output and decrease somatostatin output from the D cells.
VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide, acts positively on D cells resulting in more somatostatin being released.

The Battle of Wimpfen was a battle in the Bohemian Revolt period of the Thirty Years' War on 6 May 1622 near Wimpfen. The forces of the Holy Roman Empire and Catholic League under Marshal Tilly and Gonzalo de Córdoba defeated the Protestant forces of General Ernst von Mansfeld and Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden-Durlach.
After the fall of the Bohemian capital of Prague following the Battle of White Mountain, Georg Friedrich decided to continue the battle and oppose Tilly and Cordoba at Wimpfen. 
By early May, the forces of Christian of Brunswick had arrived to the north of the Neckar River and were prepared to assist the Protestant forces. This came as good news to the combined forces of Mansfeld and Georg Friedrich, who hoped to combine their armies before risking a major battle.
To gain time and to attempt to split the combined Catholic army, Mansfeld crossed the Neckar near Heidelberg while Georg Friedrich marched east up the river to cross at Wimpfen. The plan failed as the troops under Tilly and Córdoba did not split and instead pursued the 14,000 strong army of Georg Friedrich and cut him off near Wimpfen. Outnumbered, the margrave deployed his troops into a defensive position on a low hill outside of the village. Here the Protestants made an effective stand, rallied by a strong artillery position until a random Spanish countershot exploded the Protestant magazine, costing the Badeners their position. The Catholics drove the hill and shattered the Protestant army. Georg then fled to Stuttgart with but a few remaining men under his command.
Meanwhile, Mansfeld was hurriedly trying to meet up with Christian who was positioned at the Main; Córdoba and Tilly were in hot pursuit to keep this junction from occurring.
The story of the 400 citizens of Pforzheim who sacrificed themselves for their prince after the battle has been shown by modern research to be a myth.

The U.S. Chess Championship is an invitational tournament held to determine the national chess champion of the United States. Begun as a challenge match in 1845, the U.S. Championship has been decided by tournament play for most of its long history (Soltis, 2012).  Since 1936, it has been held under the auspices of the U.S. Chess Federation. Until 1999, the event consisted of a round-robin tournament of varying size. From 1999 to 2006, the Championship was sponsored and organized by the Seattle Chess Foundation (later renamed America's Foundation for Chess AF4C) as a large Swiss system tournament. AF4C withdrew its sponsorship in 2007. The 2007 and 2008 events were held (again under the Swiss system) in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis in St Louis has hosted the annual event since 2009.
America's national chess championship is not only the world's oldest; it has been the richest, the most experimental and, appropriately, the most democratic.[tpl]cite book|last=Soltis|first=Andy|title=The United States Chess Championship, 1845-2011|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-6528-6|pages=1|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6528-6[/tpl]

Solar variation is the change in the amount of radiation emitted by the Sun (see Solar radiation) and in its spectral distribution over years to millennia.

The changes also have aperiodic fluctuations.Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) total solar irradiance monitoring 1978 to present  (Satellite observations of total solar irradiance); access date 2012-02-03  In recent decades, solar activity has been measured by satellites, while before it was estimated using 'proxy' variables. Scientists studying climate change are interested in understanding the effects of variations in the total and spectral solar irradiance on Earth and its climate.

The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch ([tpl]zh|c=六祖壇經|p=Liùzǔ Tánjīng[/tpl] or simply: [tpl]lang|zh|壇經[/tpl] Tánjīng) is a Chan Buddhist scripture that was composed in China during the 8th to 13th century.[tpl]sfn|Schlütter|2007|p=385[/tpl] The "platform" (施法壇) refers to the podium on which a Buddhist teacher speaks.
Its key theme are the direct perception of one's true nature, and the unity in essence of śīla (conduct), dhyāna (meditation) and prajñā (wisdom).
The text centers around teachings and stories ascribed to the sixth Chan patriarch Huineng. It contains the well-known story of the contest for the succession of Hongren (enlightenment by the non-abiding), and discourses and dialogues attributed to Huineng.
The text attributes its recollection to Fa-hai, but was probably written within the so-called Oxhead School, which existed along with the East Mountain School and Shenhui's Southern School. The text attempts to reconcile the so-called Northern School with its alleged gradual enlightenment teachings, and the so-called Southern School with its alleged sudden enlightenment teachings. In effect, the text incorporates the "rhetorical purity" which originated with Shenhui's attack on Shenxiu, while effectively "writing him out of the story".[tpl]sfn|McRae|2003|p=60-69[/tpl]

The liger is a hybrid cross between a male lion (Panthera leo) and a tigress (Panthera tigris). Thus, it has parents with the same genus but of different species. It is distinct from the similar hybrid tigon. It is the largest of all known extant felines.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13520472 |title=Liger cubs nursed by dog in China's Xixiakou Zoo |publisher=BBC News Asia-Pacific |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ligerfacts.org/ |title=The Liger - Liger Facts: Meet The World's Biggest Cat |publisher=Liger Facts |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]
Ligers enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Ligers exist only in captivity because the habitats of the parental species do not overlap in the wild. Historically, when the Asiatic Lion was prolific, the territories of lions and tigers did overlap and there are legends of ligers existing in the wild. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons which tend to be about as large as a female tiger and is the cross between a male tiger and a lioness.

The Rich List is not limited to British citizens and it includes individuals and families born overseas but who predominantly work and/or live in Britain. This excludes some individuals with prominent financial assets in Britain. 
The editors estimate subjects' wealth from a range of public information, based on values at January each year. They typically explain their actions by stating: "We measure identifiable wealth, whether land, property, racehorses, art or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. We exclude bank accounts—to which we have no access... We try to give due consideration to liabilities."

[[Ballade (forme fixe)]]
CATEGORIES: Western medieval lyric forms, Renaissance music, French poetry

The ballade ([tpl]IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|d[/tpl]; not to be confused with the ballad) is a form of medieval and Renaissance French poetry as well as the corresponding musical chanson form. It was one of the three formes fixes (the other two were the rondeau and the virelai) and one of the verse forms in France most commonly set to music between the late 13th and the 15th centuries.
The ballade as a verse form typically consists of three eight-line stanzas, each with a consistent metre and a particular rhyme scheme. The last line in the stanza is a refrain. The stanzas are often followed by a four-line concluding stanza (an envoi) usually addressed to a prince. The rhyme scheme is therefore usually 'ababbcbC ababbcbC ababbcbC bcbC', where the capital 'C' is a refrain.
The many different rhyming words that are needed (the 'b' rhyme needs at least fourteen words) makes the form more difficult for English than for French poets. Geoffrey Chaucer wrote in the form. It was revived in the 19th century by English-language poets including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. Other notable English-language ballade writers are Andrew Lang and G. K. Chesterton (below). A humorous example is Wendy Cope's 'Proverbial Ballade'.

Airwolf is an American television series that ran from 1984 until 1987.  The program centers on a high-tech military helicopter, code named Airwolf, and its crew as they undertake various missions, many involving espionage, with a Cold War theme.
The show was created by Donald P. Bellisario. The first three seasons star Jan-Michael Vincent, Ernest Borgnine, Alex Cord, and (from the second season onwards) Jean Bruce Scott. After the original series was cancelled, a fourth season, with an entirely new cast and on a much smaller budget, was filmed in Canada for the USA Network.
The show's distinctive musical score, which was originally orchestral but shifted to more synthesizer-based arrangements early in the second season, was composed and mainly conducted by Sylvester Levay. Udi Harpaz conducted the scores for many later second and third season episodes.

She is an archetype of literature and art. Her ability to entrance and hypnotise her victim with a spell was in the earliest stories seen as being literally supernatural; hence, the femme fatale today is still often described as having a power akin to an enchantress, seductress, vampire, witch, or demon, having power over men.
The phrase is French for "fatal woman". A femme fatale tries to achieve her hidden purpose by using feminine wiles such as beauty, charm, and sexual allure. In some situations, she uses lies or coercion rather than charm. She may also make use of some subduing weapon such as sleeping gas, a modern analog of magical powers in older tales. She may also be (or imply that she is) a victim, caught in a situation from which she cannot escape; The Lady from Shanghai (a 1947 film noir) is one such example. 
Although typically villainous, if not morally ambiguous, and always associated with a sense of mystification and unease,Mary Ann Doane, Femme Fatales (1991) pp. 1–2 femmes fatales have also appeared as antiheroines in some stories, and some even repent and become true heroines by the end of the tale. Some stories even feature benevolent and heroic femmes fatales who use their wiles to snare the villain for the greater good.

The African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain) is a political party in Burkina Faso. It was originally known as the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) and was formed in 1957 as the Voltaic section of the African Democratic Rally (RDA).
Soon after Independence in 1960, UDV-RDA became the only legal political party in Upper Volta and a civilian dictatorship was set up. In 1966, there was a military coup to overthrow the government, and the UDV-RDA didn't exist in the new government. Under the rule of Sangoulé Lamizana UDV-RDA was reconstructed and developed good relations with the government. The relation to Lamizana did however cause internal dissent. The pro-Lamizana faction was led by Prime Minister Joseph Conombo and the anti-Lamizana faction was led by Joseph Ouédrago.
At the time of the presidential and legislative elections 1978 UDV-RDA had one list for legislative but the different factions supported different presidential candidates. The party officially supported Lamizana's candidature. The dissidents, grouped as the 'Rejectors Front-RDA' (Front du Réfus-RDA) supported the candidature of Joseph Ouédrago. After the elections this faction split away and joined the Voltaic Progressive Front of Joseph Ki-Zerbo.
After the elections Lamizana joined the party. The party was also joined by the National Union of Independents (UNI) and the African Regroupment Party (PRA), which lost their status as political parties following the elections (the 1977 Constitution limited the number of political parties to three, and PRA and UNI were the parties that came 4th and 5th thus losing their legal status).
When Lamizana was overthrown in 1980, military rule was reinstituted, and the RDA never returned to power.
Nowadays it is part of the Alliance for Democracy and Federation-African Democratic Rally (Alliance pour la Démocratie et la Fédération-Rassemblement Démocratique Africain), the largest of the many opposition parties in Burkina Faso.

[[Chairlift]]
CATEGORIES: Vertical transport devices, Aerial lifts, Ski lift types, Amusement rides

An elevated passenger ropeway, or chairlift, is a type of aerial lift, which consists of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas (in such cases referred to as 'skilifts'), but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly in urban transport.
Depending on carrier size and loading efficiency, a passenger ropeway can move up to 4000 people per hour, and the fastest lifts achieve operating speeds of up to [tpl]convert|12|m/s|ft/s|1|abbr=on[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|43.2|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. The two-person double chair, which for many years was the workhorse of the ski industry, can move roughly 1200 people per hour at rope speeds of up to [tpl]convert|2.5|m/s|ft/s|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. The four person detachable chairlift ("high-speed quad") can transport 2400 people per hour with an average rope speed of [tpl]convert|5|m/s|ft/s|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Some bi and tri cable elevated ropeways and reversible tramways achieve much greater operating speeds.

Malcolm in the Middle is an American television sitcom created by Linwood Boomer for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series was first broadcast on January 9, 2000 and ended its six-year run on May 14, 2006, after seven seasons and 151 episodes. The series received critical acclaim, and won a Peabody Award, seven Emmy Awards, one Grammy Award, and seven Golden Globe nominations.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212671/awards |title = Awards list |accessdate =April 24, 2006 |publisher=Internet Movie Database[/tpl]
The series follows a family of six (later seven), and stars Frankie Muniz in the lead role of Malcolm, a more-or-less normal boy who tests at genius level. He enjoys being smart, but he despises having to take classes for gifted children, who are mocked by the other students who call them "Krelboynes", a reference to the nerdy Seymour Krelboyne from The Little Shop of Horrors. Jane Kaczmarek is Malcolm's overbearing, authoritarian mother, Lois, and Bryan Cranston plays his disengaged but loving father, Hal. Christopher Masterson plays eldest brother Francis, a former rebel who, in earlier episodes, was in military school, but eventually marries and settles into a steady job. Justin Berfield is Malcolm's dimwitted older brother Reese, a schoolyard bully who tortures Malcolm at home even while he defends him at school. Younger brother Dewey, a genius musician, is portrayed by Erik Per Sullivan. For the first several seasons, the show's focus was on Malcolm. As the series progressed, however, it began to explore all six members of the family equally. A fifth son—Jamie—was introduced as a baby towards the middle of the series.
Malcolm in the Middle was produced by Satin City and Regency Television in association with Fox Television Studios (syndicated by Fox corporate sibling 20th Television). The show has proven popular worldwide and has been syndicated in 57 countries. In the United States, it had been syndicated during the day on FX and at night on Nickelodeon's sister channel TeenNick, as well as local stations. In the United Kingdom, it originally aired on Sky1 then eventually began on BBC Two, its HD counterpart and Sky2, however after Sky stopped airing repeats of the show, the rights were bought by Channel 5 and are now shown on 5*. In Ireland it aired on TV3's sister channel 3e. It was also syndicated on Network Ten in Australia (originally airing on the Nine Network) and on Comedy Central in India. In Canada, episodes were shown on the Global Television Network.
The show placed No. 88 on Entertainment Weekly[tpl]'s[/tpl] "New TV Classics" list,[tpl]cite web|title=The New Classics: TV|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 5, 2012|date=June 18, 2007[/tpl] and was named by Alan Sepinwall of HitFix as one of the 10 best shows in Fox network history.[tpl]cite web|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=The 10 best shows in FOX network history|url=http://www.hitfix.com/galleries/the-10-best-shows-in-fox-network-history#3|work=HitFix|publisher=HitFix, Inc.|accessdate=February 3, 2014|date=April 18, 2012[/tpl]

Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics was the first appearance of the sport as an official medal event.  The tournament was played between 7 August and 14 August 1936 in Berlin, Germany.  23 nations entered the competition, making basketball the largest tournament of the team sports. 
The International Basketball Federation, which is the governing body of international basketball, used the 1936 tournament to experiment with outdoor basketball.  Lawn tennis courts were used for the competition.  This caused problems when the weather was adverse, especially during the final game.
The medals were awarded by James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.  All went to North American teams.

[[Salami slicing]]
CATEGORIES: Fraud, Data security

Salami slicing refers to a series of many small actions, often performed by clandestine means, that as an accumulated whole produces a much larger action or result that would be difficult or unlawful to perform all at once.  The term is typically used pejoratively.  Although salami slicing is often used to carry out illegal activities, it is only a strategy for gaining an advantage over time by accumulating it in small increments, so it can be used in perfectly legal ways as well.
An example of salami slicing, also known as penny shaving, is the fraudulent practice of stealing money repeatedly in extremely small quantities, usually by taking advantage of rounding to the nearest cent (or other monetary unit) in financial transactions.  It would be done by always rounding down, and putting the fractions of a cent into another account. The idea is to make the change small enough that any single transaction will go undetected.[tpl]cite web|url=http://all.net/CID/Attack/papers/Salami2.html|title=Salami Attacks[/tpl]
In information security, a salami attack is a series of minor attacks that together results in a larger attack. Computers are ideally suited to automating this type of attack.
In politics, the term salami tactics has been used since the 1940s to refer to a divide and conquer process of threats and alliances used to overcome opposition.
In academia, salami slicing refers to the practice of creating several short publications out of material that could have, perhaps more validly, been published as a single article in a journal or review. (See also least publishable unit).

[[Current liability]]
CATEGORIES: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Liability

In accounting, current liabilities are often understood as all liabilities of the business that are to be settled in cash within the fiscal year or the operating cycle of a given firm, whichever period is longer.  A more complete definition is that current liabilities are obligations that will be settled by current assets or by the creation of new current liabilities.  Accounts payable are due within 30 days, and are paid within 30 days, but do often run past 30 days or 60 days in some situations.  The laws regarding late payment and claims for unpaid accounts payable is related to the issue of accounts payable. An operating cycle for a firm is the average time that is required to go from cash to cash in producing revenues.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] For example, accounts payable for goods, services or supplies that were purchased for use in the operation of the business and payable within a normal period would be current liabilities.  Amounts listed on a balance sheet as accounts payable represent all
bills payable to vendors of a company, whether or not the bills are less than 31 days old or more than 30 days old. Therefore late payments are not disclosed on the balance sheet for accounts payable.  There may be footnotes in audited financial statements regarding age of accounts payable but this is not common accounting practice.  Lawsuits regarding accounts payable are required to be shown on audited financial statements but this is not necessarily common accounting practice.
Bonds, mortgages and loans that are payable over a term exceeding one year would be fixed liabilities or long-term liabilities.  However, the payments due on the long-term loans in the current fiscal year could be considered current liabilities if the amounts were material. Amounts due to lenders/ bankers are never shown as accounts payable/ trade accounts payable, but will show up on the balance sheet of a company under the major heading of current liabilites, and often under the sub-heading of other current liabilites, instead of accounts payable, which are due to vendors.  Other current liabilites are due for payment according to the terms of the loan agreements, but when lender liabilites are shown as current vs. long term, they are due within the current fiscal year or earlier. Therefore late payments from a previous fiscal year will carry over into the same position on the balance sheet as current liabilities which are not late in payment.  There may be footnotes in audited financial statements regarding past due payments to lenders, but this is not common practice.  Lawsuits regarding loans payable are required to be shown on audited financial statements, but this is not necessarily common accounting practice.
The proper classification of liabilities provides useful information to investors and other users of the financial statements.  It may be regarded as essential for allowing outsiders to consider a true picture of an organization's fiscal health.
One application is in the current ratio, defined as the firm's current assets divided by its current liabilities.  A ratio higher than one means that current assets, if they can all be converted to cash, are more than sufficient to pay off current obligations.  All other things equal, higher values of this ratio imply that a firm is more easily able to meet its obligations in the coming year.

Deepak Chopra ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|p|ɑː|k|_|ˈ|tʃ|oʊ|p|r|ə[/tpl]; born October 22, 1947) is an Indian-American author and alternative medicine/New Age guru. A licensed physician, he began a medical career in hospitals and universities in the Northeastern United States, becoming Chief of Staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH). In 1985, Chopra met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who invited him to study Ayurveda. Chopra left his position at the NEMH and became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, and was later named medical director of the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center. In 1996, Chopra and fellow physician-turned-alternative-medicine-advocate David Simon founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing, advertising it as having a "holistic view of life".
Chopra has enjoyed business success from the sale of a range of books, courses and alternative and complementary health products. He has written more than 50 books which have been translated into 35 languages. Chopra is a controversial figure. According to a 2008 article in Time magazine, he is "a magnet for criticism", primarily from those involved in science and medicine. Critics have taken issue with his "nonsensical" references to quantum theory, criticized his descriptions of AIDS and cancer, and said the claims he makes for ineffective alternative medicine may bring "false hope" to people who are sick.

[[Intangible asset]]

Intangible assets have been argued to be one possible contributor to the disparity between company value as per their accounting records, and company value as per their market capitalization.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lev|first=Baruch|coauthors=Daum, Juergen|title=The dominance of intangible assets: consequences for enterprise management and corporate reporting|journal=Measuring Business Excellence|year=2004|volume=8|issue=1|pages=6–17|doi=10.1108/13683040410524694|url=http://iioe.de/fileadmin/files/publications/Lev_Daum_Dominanance_of_IA_MBE_2004.pdf[/tpl] Considering this argument, it is important to understand what an intangible asset truly is in the eyes of an accountant. A number of attempts have been made to define intangible assets:
The lack of physical substance would therefore seem to be a defining characteristic of an intangible asset. Both the IASB and FASB definitions specifically preclude monetary assets in their definition of an intangible asset. This is necessary in order to avoid the classification of items such as accounts receivable, derivatives and cash in the bank as an intangible asset. IAS 38 contains examples of intangible assets, including: computer software, copyright and patents.

The Churches of Chiloé in Chile's Chiloé Archipelago are a unique architectural phenomenon in the Americas, and one of the most prominent styles of Chilota architecture. Unlike classical Spanish colonial architecture, the churches of Chiloé are made entirely in native timber with extensive use of wood shingles. The churches were built from materials to resist Chiloé Archipelago's humid and rainy oceanic climate.
Built in the 18th and 19th centuries when Chiloé Archipelago was still a part of the Spanish Crown possessions, the churches represent the fusion of European Jesuit culture and local native peoples' skill and traditions: an excellent example of mestizo culture.
The Churches of Chiloé were designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2000. The University of Chile, Fundación Cultural Iglesias de Chiloé and other institutions have led efforts to preserve these historic structures and to publicize them for their unique qualities.Berg Costa, Lorenzo (2005), Restauración Iglesias de Chiloé Conservando lo Infinito, Editorial Universitaria, p. 3, ISBN 956-11-1778-9

As a legal fiction, the "reasonable person" is not an average person or a typical person.  Instead, the "reasonable person" is a composite of a relevant community's judgment as to how a typical member of said community should behave in situations that might pose a threat of harm (through action or inaction) to the public.[tpl]cite court|litigants=R v Camplin |vol= |reporter=A.C. |opinion=705 |pinpoint= |court= |year=1978 |url= |quote=reasonable man "means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of self control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today [/tpl]
The standard also holds that each person owes a duty to behave as a reasonable person would under the same or similar circumstances.[tpl]cite court|litigants=Brown v. Kendall |vol=60 |reporter=Mass. |opinion=292 |pinpoint= |court= |year=1850 |url= |quote= [/tpl]Franklin, at 54 While the specific circumstances of each case will require varying kinds of conduct and degrees of care, the reasonable person standard undergoes no variation itself.[tpl]cite court|litigants=Triestram v. Way |vol=281 |reporter=N.W. |opinion=420 |pinpoint= |court=Mich. |year=1938 |url= |quote= [/tpl]Franklin, at 55
The "reasonable person" construct can be found applied in many areas of the law.  The standard performs a crucial role in determining negligence in both criminal law—that is, criminal negligence—and tort law.
The standard also has a presence in contract law, though its use there is substantially different.For the use in transnational contract law: Trans-Lex.org It is used to determine contractual intent, or if a breach of the standard of care has occurred, provided a duty of care can be proven. The intent of a party can be determined by examining the understanding of a reasonable person, after consideration is given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties.Determining the Contractual Intent of Parties under the CISG and Common Law -- A Comparative Analysis, European Journal of Law Reform (Kluwer) Vol. 4, No. 4 (2002) 629-643, by Bruno Zeller, 2002, last updated, June 30, 2006
The standard does not exist independently of other circumstances within a case that could affect an individual's judgment.

[[Médard des Groseilliers]]

Médard Chouart des Groseilliers (1618–1696) was a French explorer and fur trader in Canada. He is often paired with his brother-in-law Pierre-Esprit Radisson who was about 20 years younger. Their decision to enter the English service led to the foundation of the Hudson's Bay Company which in turn was a major factor in making western Canada English.
He was born at Charly-sur-Marne in France and later called himself Sieur des Groseilliers after a farm his parents managed in Bassevelle. Some English documents call him Mr. Gooseberry which is the translation of his name. He came to Quebec about 1641 and became a donné or lay helper at the Jesuit missions in the Huron country. Here he learned the skills of a coureur des bois. In 1647 he married Helène, the daughter of Abraham Martin whose land later became famous as the Plains of Abraham. In 1653 he married his second wife, the widowed step-sister of Pierre-Esprit Radisson, Marguerite Hayet. After the Iroquois destroyed the Huron missions he worked to re-establish trade, especially in the Lake Superior region. He and Radisson went to Lake Superior in 1658/60 where they were among the first Europeans to contact the Sioux who then lived near the lake. From Cree traders they came to understand that the main source of furs lay northwest of the lake. In 1661/63 they journeyed to an uncertain location (guesses range from Lake Winnipeg to Rupert House). On their return they were fined most of their profits because they had left Quebec without a license. (The French in Canada had to choose between two policies. They could either build up a dense European settlement on the  Saint Lawrence and let Indians bring furs to them, or spread out into a wilderness too large to administer or protect. Groseilliers was caught when the first policy was in effect).
Groseilliers went to France to appeal, without success. From France he seems to have tried to organize an expedition into Hudson Bay. Disgusted with the French authorities, he and Radisson went to Boston where they organized another expedition into the bay which was turned back by the ice. At Boston in 1665 they met George Cartwright who had been involved in the 1664 British conquest of New York. Cartwright passed them to Sir George Carteret in England. Captured by Dutch privateers, they were put ashore in Spain. Reaching England, they were presented to King Charles and entered the circle of the Duke of York and Prince Rupert and General Monck. This combination of wilderness knowledge and political backing led to the formation of the Hudson's Bay Company. Plans were made, but nothing could be done because of the Dutch war. On June 3, 1668 two ships left England for Hudson Bay: the Nonsuch with Groseilliers and the Eaglet with Radisson. The Eaglet was caught in a storm and had to return. On 25 September the Nonsuch reached the mouth of the Rupert River where they built a fort for the winter. They left the following June and reached England in October 1669 with a rich cargo of furs. The Hudson's Bay Company was founded in May 1670. In 1670 Radisson and Groseilliers returned to the bay, claiming Port Nelson and trading at Rupert House They seem to have made several more trips. In 1674 he was at Rupert House when Father Charles Albanel arrived from Quebec to interfere with the English. The priest was taken into custody and sent to England on the same ship as Radisson and Grosseilliers. Father Albanel, and an offer of money, induced them to return to the French service.
Having twice betrayed their masters, they hoped for favorable treatment in France but did not find it. They were shipped back to Canada where Frontenac was also suspicious. Groseilliers returned home to Trois-Rivieres and Radisson went to France. Without occupation, Radisson became a midshipman under Jean II d'Estrées and was nearly drowned at Las Aves. He went to England in an attempt to retrieve his wife, but her father would not allow her to go to France. He made feelers to rejoin the HBC, but these were rejected. In 1681 in Paris Radisson was approached by Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye and the following year they formed the Compaignie du Nord or Compaignie de la Baie D'Hudson to compete with the Hudson's Bay Company by tapping the richer furs northwest of the English posts on James Bay. The English had the same idea. In 1682 the brothers-in-law arrived at the mouth of the Hayes River and settled in. Six days earlier an unofficial expedition had arrived from Boston at the mouth of the Nelson River (Benjamin Guillam in the Bachelor's Delight). The French became aware of the Bostonians when they fired a cannon for a funeral. France and England not being at war, the Radisson and Gillam made a truce.  Returning from his meeting with Guillam, Radisson saw two more ships. These were the official Hudson's Bay Company ships (Prince Rupert and Albemarle under Zachariah Gillam). Lighting a signal fire to keep the two English groups from meeting, Radisson made a second truce.  On 21 October the Prince Rupert was lost in a storm. Later the two French ships were crushed by the ice and one had to be repaired by cannibalizing the other. The following February the Boston party was captured by the French. The HBC men were captured, probably in early summer when the Albemarle left for James Bay. On 27 July 1683 the French left for Quebec in the Bachelor's Delight with 2000 pelts. Most of the English were sent to the English posts in the repaired French ship. Groseilliers' son Jean-Baptiste Chuart and seven men were left at Port Nelson. In August the Albemarle returned from James Bay. It is not clear what happened, but both sides were able to trade for furs. of this story do not make sense. Most of it comes from Radisson's account which is known to be inaccurate in places.
When the brothers-in-law reached Quebec the authorities had a problem. England and France were at peace. Further the Catholic Duke of York was now governor of Hudson's Bay Company and was expected to become king and rule in the French interest. The Bachelor's Delight was either confiscated Newman,page 102 or sent back to Boston with Benjamin Guillam.Morton, page 93 The brothers-in-law were made to pay the regular Quebec tax which was questionable since it was not certain that Hudson Bay was in Quebec. In 1684, for diplomatic reasons, France compensated the Hudson's Bay Company for its losses. Radisson went to France to straighten out the legal problems. Newman says that Groseilliers, now 65, retired in disgust to a small seigneury at Trois-Rivières and died in 1696. Morton says that he went to France with Radisson and separated from his brother-in-law when the latter rejoined the English. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography says that his fate is uncertain.

[[Papelucho]]

CATEGORIES: Children's fiction books, Chilean literature, Series of children's books

Papelucho is the main character in a series of children books created by Chilean writer Marcela Paz. Twelve books were published between 1947 and 1974. They became a classic among books for children in Chile.
The books are written in the form of diaries by the title character, a middle class, 8-year old Chilean boy in Santiago. This makes it different from many other children's books, which are set in unreal surroundings. Papelucho is able to find interest and humour in everyday life, and does this by means of an exuberant fantasy, a strong sense of observation and ridicule, and highly developed originality and creativity. In this respect it shows similarity with other widely read works of the European children's literature, which also depict the adventures of children's everyday life, such as Goscinny y Sempé's "Le petit Nicolas", Richmal Crompton's "William" series, and Elena Fortún's "Celia" books in Spanish.
The first book of the series, "Papelucho", was published in 1947, after it won an award in a contest of a young Chilean publishing house, Rapa Nui. The illustrations belong to Yolanda Huneeus, a sister of the author. The book very quickly became a bestseller in Chile and one edition followed another. Eleven books followed; the last one appeared in 1974: "Am I Dix-lazy?".
The sales of the series, in all editions starting from 1947, summed in 2007 up to more than five million copies sold. It is listed as 'recommended reading' at Chilean schools and is currently (2011) edited by Random House in Santiago, Chile.

Ali Kelmendi (born 1900 in İpek, now Peć, Ottoman Empire – died 11 February 1939 in France), Hero of Albania under the communist government, was a Kosovar Albanian communist, an organizer of the communist movement in Albania.
Ali Kelmendi was born in 1900 in a poor peasant family in the town of İpek in the Kosovo province of the Ottoman Empire (in present-day Kosovo[tpl]ref label|status|a|[/tpl]). In 1920 he fled to Albania after all communist activities were banned in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. There he joined the left-wing political movement "Bashkimi" (English:Unity) of Avni Rustemi, Llazar Fundo, and Fuat Asllani.[tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq=ali+kelmendi&source=bl&ots=-SAp0IxwWF&sig=hV3fkJK4c7XHNx-vL8_eYp4JAuI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eNzaUt2FAuvisATBzIHYDA&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=ali%20kelmendi&f=false| pages=235–236| author=Robert Elsie| title=A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History| isbn=978-1780764313| publisher=I.

In June 1924, he participated in the resurgence led by Fan Noli in Albania as a fighter. After the fall of Noli's regime (December 1924) he emigrated to Brindisi, Italy, thereafter to Austria. Kelmendi joined the anti-Zogist group KONARE ([tpl]lang-en|Revolutionary National Committee[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sq|Komiteti Nacional Revolucionar[/tpl]) founded by Noli.
 On 8 October 1925 Kelmendi went then to the Soviet Union together with other 13 Albanians based on an study-related invitation from COMINTERN. He passed one year in the Dzerzhinsky Academy in Leningrad (today's "Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich"), and after that he moved to Odessa to work as customs official. There he joined the Albanian communist group affiliated to the Balkan Confederation of Communist Parties belonging to the Communist International.
In 1930, the Communist International sent Kelmendi to Albania as an organizer of the communist movement. He also made some organizational work in Kosovo. However, his work bore no considerable fruit since Marxism hadn't found any favorable soil in Albania and the clandestine work was very difficult because of the activity of the security police. Kelmendi was arrested several times and in 1936 he was exiled. He went shortly back to Russia in March 1932, and after the exile from Albania to Greece and then Moscow. He later server as an intermediary between COMINTERN and Albanian communist groups. Kelmendi participated in the Spanish Civil War.[tpl]cite book| author=Miranda Vickers| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC&pg=PA145&dq=ali+kelmendi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d-DaUvnBIJTRsAS7xIDoBg&ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=ali%20kelmendi&f=false| page=145|title=The Albanians: A Modern History| isbn=978-1860645419| date=June 1, 2001| publisher=I.

Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (11 May 1827 – 12 October 1875) was a French sculptor and painter during the Second Empire under Napoleon III
Born in Valenciennes, Nord, son of a mason, his early studies were under François Rude. Carpeaux entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1844 and won the Prix de Rome in 1854, and moving to Rome to find inspiration, he there studied the works of Michelangelo, Donatello and Verrocchio. Staying in Rome from 1854 to 1861, he obtained a taste for movement and spontaneity, which he joined with the great principles of baroque art.  Carpeaux sought real life subjects in the streets and broke with the classical tradition. 
While a student in Rome, Carpeaux submitted a plaster version of Pêcheur napolitain à la coquille, the Neapolitan Fisherboy, to the French Academy.  He carved the marble version several years later, showing it in the Salon exhibition of 1863. It was purchased for Napoleon III's empress, Eugènie. The statue of the young smiling boy was very popular, and Carpeaux created a number of reproductions and variations in marble and bronze. There is a copy, for instance, in the Samuel H. Kress Collection in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C..  Some years later, he carved the Girl with a Shell, a very similar study.
In 1861 he made a bust of Princess Mathilde, and this later brought him several commissions from Napoleon III. 
Among his students were Jules Dalou, Jean-Louis Forain and the American sculptor Olin Levi Warner.  Carpeaux died at age 48 in Courbevoie.

[[Earl of Castlehaven]]
CATEGORIES: Earldoms in the Peerage of Ireland, Extinct earldoms in the Peerage of Ireland, County Co-Mayo

Earl of Castlehaven was a peerage title in the Peerage of Ireland, created on September 6, 1616. It was held in conjunction with the Barony of Audley (created 1312 in the Peerage of England), the Barony of Audley of Orier (created with the earldom in the Peerage of Ireland), and the Barony of Audley of Hely (created for the third Earl in 1633, in the Peerage of England).
Upon the attainder and execution of the second earl for sodomy, under the Buggery Act 1533 in 1631, he forfeited his English peerage, but not his Irish titles; this was because his English barony of Audley had been created for heirs general, but his Irish earldom and barony was an entailed honour protected by statute De Donis. His son, the third earl, was created Baron Audley of Hely on June 3, 1633 by letters patent, with the precedence of his grandfather, in an attempt to restore to him the original Barony of Audley. However, this was deemed insufficient to do so; a bill was passed in Parliament in 1678 which allowed him to inherit the original Barony despite the attainder. Ironically, within months he was barred from the House of Lords as a Roman Catholic under the Second Test Act.
With the death of the eighth earl, the Earldom of Castlehaven and the Baronies of Audley of Hely and Audley of Orier became extinct. The Barony of Audley created by writ of 1312 devolved upon his nephew, George Thicknesse, 19th Baron Audley.

The Battle of Kleidion (or Clidium, after the medieval name of the village of Klyuch, "(the) key"; also known as the Battle of Belasitsa) took place on July 29, 1014 between the Bulgarian Empire and the Byzantine Empire.  It was the culmination of the nearly half-century struggle between the Bulgarian Emperor Samuel and the Byzantine Emperor Basil II in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. The result was a decisive Byzantine victory.
The battle took place in the valley between the mountains of Belasitsa and Ograzhden near the modern Bulgarian village of Klyuch. The decisive encounter occurred on July 29 with an attack in the rear by a force under the Byzantine general Nikephoros Xiphias, who had infiltrated the Bulgarian positions. The ensuing battle was a major defeat for the Bulgarians. Bulgarian soldiers were captured and reputedly blinded by order of Basil II, who would subsequently be known as the "Bulgar-Slayer". Samuel survived the battle, but died two months later from a heart attack, reportedly brought on by the sight of his blind soldiers.
Although the engagement did not end the First Bulgarian Empire, the Battle of Kleidion reduced its ability to resist Byzantine advances and can be considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium. The heirs of Samuel could not subsequently hold off the Byzantine advance, and in 1018 the Bulgarian Empire was finally destroyed by Basil II.

Roman currency for most of Roman history consisted of gold, silver, brass, and copper coinage. From its introduction to the Republic, during the third century BC, well into Imperial times, Roman currency saw many changes in form, denomination, and composition. A persistent feature was the inflationary debasement and replacement of coins over the centuries. Notable examples of this followed the reforms of Diocletian. This trend continued into Byzantine times.

Sir Edward Herbert (c. 1591–1658) was Welsh lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1641. He was Attorney-General under Charles I. 
Herbert was the son of Charles Herbert of Aston, Montgomeryshire. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1609 and was called to the bar in 1618. In 1621 he was elected  Member of Parliament for Montgomery. He was elected MP for Downton, Wiltshire in 1624 for the Happy Parliament and was re-elected in 1626 and 1629.  
In April 1640 Herbert was elected MP for Reading  and  for Old Sarum and chose to sit for Old Sarum in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Old Sarum in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. He had become Attorney-General and he was instructed by Charles I to take proceedings against some members of Parliament who had been concerned in the passing of the Grand Remonstrance. The only result, however, was Herbert's own impeachment by the House of Commons in 1641 and his imprisonment. 
Herbert lived at Aston in Montgomeryshire. Later in life, he lived in exile with the royal family in Holland and in France, becoming Lord Keeper of the Great Seal to Charles II in April 1653, an office which he had refused in 1645. He resigned that office the next year.  He died in Paris.
Herbert married Margaret Carey, widow of Thomas Carey of Sunninghill Park, Berkshire and daughter of Thomas Smith of Abingdon-on-Thames and Parson's Green, Middlesex.  One of Herbert's sons was Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington, and another was Sir Edward Herbert (c. 1648-1698). He was the cousin of Edward Herbert, Baron Herbert of Cherbury.

Like the Mongols, the Manchus were simply called by given name but they had their own clan names (hala in Manchu). Hala consisted of several mukūn, the unit of exogamy. Unlike hala, mukūn did not have corresponding names.
The Comprehensive Book of the Eight Manchurian Banners' Surname-Clans (八旗滿洲氏族通譜 Baqi Manzhou Zhizu Tongpu), compiled in the middle 18th century, records many Manchu clan names. Among more than a thousand names, about 600 names are the Manchus'.
Gioro, one of major names, is the only name that has various suffix such as Irgen, Silin and Šušu, possibly to distinguish from the imperial family name Aisin-Gioro.  Since the mid-to-late Qing Dynasty, Manchus have increasingly adopted Chinese surnames, and today, very few Manchus bear traditional Manchu family name.

The Buffalo River, located in northern Arkansas, was the first National River to be designated in the United States. The Buffalo River is slightly more than [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] long. The lower [tpl]convert|135|mi|km[/tpl] flow within the boundaries of an area managed by the National Park Service, where the stream is designated the Buffalo National River.[tpl]cite web|title=Buffalo National River|url=http://www.nps.gov/buff/index.htm|publisher=National Park Service|date=January 16, 2013|accessdate=February 9, 2013[/tpl] The river flows through Newton, Searcy, Marion, and Baxter Counties, from west to east. The river originates in the highest part of Boston Mountains of the Ozarks, flows out onto the Springfield Plateau near the historic community of Erbie, and finally crosses the Salem Plateau just before joining the White River. The Park is home to the state's only elk herd. The upper section of the river in the Ozark National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service and is designated as a National Scenic River and a National Wild River; that section is not part of the area managed as a park by the Park Service, but is managed as a part of the Ozark National Forest.
The Buffalo National River was established by an Act of Congress on March 1, 1972, ending the recurring plans of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct one or more dams on the river. The National River designation protects natural rivers from industrial uses, impoundments and other obstructions that may change the natural character of the river or disrupt the natural habitat for the flora and fauna that live in or near the river.
At a point about [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] above the Park boundary in Newton County, Arkansas, the Buffalo River begins as the Main Prong of Big Buffalo Creek. On 1:24,000 scale United States Geological Survey topographic maps, the Buffalo River is shown to form at the confluence of Reeves Fork and Big Buffalo Creek north of Fallsville, Arkansas.  The river flows north through Boxley to Ponca, where it then begins an eastward trek across northern Arkansas to its confluence with the White River on the Marion-Baxter County line. Advanced canoeists and kayakers often refer to the [tpl]convert|15|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] section upriver from Boxley, Arkansas as the Hailstone River. This extremely challenging section of the river is floatable only during periods of high water and should be attempted only by those with solid whitewater skills.
Along the upper river, the gradient is steep and the water is fast, leveling and slowing as the river runs its course. The upper section has most of the whitewater rapids to be found along the river, and features dramatic topography including sink holes and caves, springs, and waterfalls, over [tpl]convert|500|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] tall sandstone and limestone bluffs, and many rock formations. At one point, a [tpl]convert|0.65|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] hike from the river up a narrow, boxed canyon leads to a [tpl]convert|209|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] waterfall,Ernst, Tim (Nov. 2002). Arkansas Waterfalls Guidebook, Cloudland.net, 224 pp. ISBN 1-882906-48-9. Hemmed-In-Hollow Falls, the highest of its kind between the Southern Appalachians and the Rockies. The river's ancient current also gives life to well over 300 species of fish, insects, freshwater mussels, and aquatic plants.
The Buffalo National River is a popular camping, canoeing, and fishing destination. Visitors may bring their own canoes or rent from several independent concessioners. Camping is generally allowed throughout the park with the following exceptions:  the Hemmed-in-Hollow area, on Big Bluff, in historical structures, on private property within the park, or within [tpl]convert|100|ft|m[/tpl] of any trail or watercourse. Camping is, however, permitted on gravel bars and sand bars along the river.  In addition, the National Park Service has a number of "developed" campgrounds along the river.
The National Park Service headquarters for the Buffalo National River is located in Harrison, Arkansas.

Lurgan ([tpl]Irish derived place name|an Lorgain|the shin-shaped hill[/tpl]) is a town in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. The town is near the southern shore of Lough Neagh and in the north-eastern corner of the county. Part of the Craigavon Borough Council area, Lurgan is about 18 miles (29 km) south-west of Belfast and is linked to the city by both the M1 motorway and the Belfast–Dublin railway line. It had a population of about 23,000 at the 2001 Census.
Lurgan is characteristic of many Plantation of Ulster settlements, with its straight, wide planned streets and rows of cottages. It is the site of a number of historic listed buildings including Brownlow House and the former town hall.
Historically the town was known as a major centre for the production of textiles (mainly linen) after the industrial revolution and it continued to be a major producer of textiles until that industry steadily declined in the 1990s and 2000s. The development of the 'new city' of Craigavon had a major impact on Lurgan in the 1960s when much industry was attracted to the area. The expansion of Craigavon's Rushmere Retail Park in the 2000s has affected the town's retail trade further.

[[Theatrical constraints]]

CATEGORIES: Theatre, Censorship in the arts

Theatrical constraints are various rules, either of taste or of law, that govern the production, staging, and content of stage plays in the theater.   Whether imposed externally, by virtue of monopoly franchises or censorship laws, or whether imposed voluntarily by actors, directors, or producers, these restraints have taxed the creative minds of the theatre to  tackle the challenges of working with and around them. 
The Classical unities, requiring "unity" of "time, place, and subject", is the most well-known of all theatrical constraints.  It was first employed by the Ancient Greeks and later became more fully embraced in France. Another example is the Japanese prohibition of female acting in 1625, then the prohibition of young male actors in 1657, that create "Onnagata" which is the ground of Japanese theatrical tradition.  In the Elizabethan theatre of Shakespeare, a similar ban forbade all actresses from appearing on stage, at all; the parts of women were generally played by boys.  The plot of Shakespeare in Love turns on this fact.
In cinema, the Dogme 95 films form a body of work produced under voluntary constraints that severely limit both the choice of subjects and the choice of techniques used to bring them to the screen.  
Another culturally significant constraint occurred in France.  In the late seventeenth century (1697 to be exact) Italian companies were prohibited from appearing in France, so native actors - strolling players going from fairground to fairground, market place to market place - took over the Italian plays and made the roles their own with great success.
But this aroused the jealousy of the Comédie-Française which decided to outlaw all spoken dialogue except in its own theatre. To overcome this, the travelling players divided their plays into soliloquies and performed nothing but monologues - which brought them even greater success than previously.   One actor would say his lines, run off into the wings, while another appeared in order to reply. He would then go off in his turn, allowing the first one to come back and reply, and so on and so forth.
After this, the Comédie-Française declared that they alone had the right to use speech on stage. Consequently the public theatre found its way round this by using song instead of speech - and this is how French Operetta came into being. But then the Academy of Music proclaimed that they alone should be given the right to sing!
So in the markets and fairgrounds the itinerant actors created a new theatrical form by holding up cue-cards (like sub-titles or karaoke) containing the words of the plays or songs, which the audience then acted or sang for them. This became even more successful, with crowds coming from all around to see how the actors had overcome such rigid censorship. 
Some of the restrictions, or traditions born of them, may have still been in place in the nineteenth century, at least if Marcel Carné's Les Enfants du Paradis is a reliable guide.  This also explains why France has given the world so many mimes.

[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 novels, American alternate history novels, Novels by Kim Stanley Robinson, HarperCollins books, Akbar

The Years of Rice and Salt is an alternate history novel written by science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson and published in 2002. The novel explores how subsequent world history may have been different if the Black Death plague had killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Divided into ten parts, the story spans hundreds of years, from the army of the Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re-populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67 year long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the ten parts take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified to the reader by the first letter of their name being consistent in each life.
The novel explores themes of history, religion, and social movements. The historical narrative is guided more by social history than political or military history. Critics found the book to be rich in detail, realistic, and thoughtful. Robinson had previously published several other science fiction novels and short stories which had won him several Nebula, Hugo and Locus Awards. The Years of Rice and Salt won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2003. In the same year it was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, a Hugo Award, and a British Science Fiction Award.

[[Stochastic context-free grammar]]

CATEGORIES: Bioinformatics, Formal languages, Language modeling, Natural language parsing, Statistical natural language processing, Probabilistic models

Grammar theory to model symbol strings originated from work in computational linguistics aiming at understanding the structure of natural languages. Through controlled grammar exploring and scoring the correctness of a sentence construct in a language by computation is achievable. Grammars are said to be generative grammars/transformational grammars if their rules are used to predict/emit words forming grammatical sentences. Probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) have been applied in probabilistic modeling of RNA structures almost 40 years post their introduction in computational linguistics.
PCFGs extend context-free grammars similar to how hidden Markov models extend regular grammars. Each production is assigned a probability. The probability of a derivation (parse) is the product of the probabilities of the productions used in that derivation. These probabilities are typically computed by machine learning programs operating on large databases. A probabilistic grammar's validity is constrained by context of its training dataset.
PCFGs have application in areas as diverse as natural language processing to the study the structure of RNA molecules and design of programming languages. Designing efficient PCFG grammars has to weigh factors of scalability and generality. Issues such as grammar ambiguity need to be resolved. The grammar design influences results accuracy. Grammar parsing algorithms have various time and memory requirements.

[[Oil sands]]
CATEGORIES: Bituminous sands, Petroleum geology, Petroleum industry, Unconventional oil

Oil sands, tar sands or, more technically, bituminous sands, are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit.
The oil sands are loose sand or partially consolidated sandstone containing naturally occurring mixtures of sand, clay, and water, saturated with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen (or colloquially tar due to its similar appearance, odour and colour). Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries, but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in Canada.  Other large reserves are located in Kazakhstan and Russia. The estimated worldwide deposits of oil are more than [tpl]convert|2|Toilbbl|abbr=off[/tpl];[tpl]cite web|title=About Tar Sands|url=http://ostseis.anl.gov/guide/tarsands/index.cfm[/tpl] the estimates include deposits that have not yet been discovered.  Proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels,[tpl]cite journal|title=Bitumen and heavy crudes: The energy security problem solved? |year=2006 |journal=Oil and Energy Trends |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=3–5 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-7992.2006.310603.x [/tpl]  and total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at [tpl]convert|249.67|Goilbbl|abbr=on[/tpl] globally, of which [tpl]convert|176.8|Goilbbl|abbr=on[/tpl], or 70.8%, are in Canada.
Oil sands reserves have only recently[tpl]when|date=March 2014[/tpl] been considered to be part of the world's oil reserves, as higher oil prices and new technology enable profitable extraction and processing. Oil produced from bitumen sands is often referred to as unconventional oil or crude bitumen, to distinguish it from liquid hydrocarbons produced from traditional oil wells.
The crude bitumen contained in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as "a highly viscous mixture of hydrocarbons heavier than pentanes which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow."  Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) that it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses.[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]
[/ref]  The World Energy Council (WEC) defines natural bitumen as "oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10° API".  The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dusseault|first=M. B.|title=Comparing Venezuelan and Canadian heavy oil and tar sands|journal=Proceedings of Petroleum Society's Canadian International Conference|date=12–14 June 2001|volume=2001-061|pages=20p[/tpl]  Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria. According to the WEC, extra-heavy oil has "a gravity of less than 10° API and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000 centipoise".
Making liquid fuels from oil sands requires energy for steam injection and refining. This process generates 12 percent more greenhouse gases per barrel of final product than extraction of conventional oil.[tpl]Cite news |author=Barbara Lewis, David Ljunggren and Jeffrey Jones |title= Canada's Tar Sands Battle With Europe |agency=Reuters |date=10 May 2012 |publisher=huffington post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/10/canada-tar-sands-battle-europe_n_1505658.html[/tpl]

The title was also given occasionally to another woman of the same generation, while a woman from the previous generation was sometimes given the title of Grand empress dowager.  Numerous empress dowagers held regency during the reign of an underage emperor.  Many of the most prominent empress dowagers also extended their control for long periods after the emperor was old enough to govern.  This was a source of political turmoil according to the traditional view of Chinese history.
The title Dowager Empress was given to the wife of a deceased Emperor of Russia, or of the Holy Roman Emperor.

De Sousa Santos et al. (2007) Another Knowledge Is Possible: Beyond Northern Epistemologies (Reinventing Social Emancipation: Toward New Manifestos), London: Verso 
The opening up of political sociology does not mean that old topics have been discarded.  Traditionally there were four main areas of research:
In other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies.Nachtigal M. Paul."Political Trends Affecting Nonmetropolitan America." Journal of Research in Rural Education Vol.10 (1994):161–166. Print. From:  From this perspective we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory and class analysis (which overlaps with  Marxist analysis).Bentley, Peter, Arnold Rose, Talcott Parsons, and Neil Smelser. "Political Sociological Theories:Theories of the State and Power." 16 Jan. 2003. Web. 28 Sept 2009 from:  Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol.  Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites.Lewis A. Coser. Masters of sociological Thought.Class Theory 1977: 48–50. Web. Retrieved 29 Sept 2009 from  It can be split into two parts.  One is the 'power structure' or 'instrumentalist' approach, another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on 'Who Rules?' and its most well-known representative is G. William Domhoff. The structuralist approach emphasizes on the way a capitalist economy operates; only allowing and encouraging the state to do some things but not others (Nicos Poulantzas, Bob Jessop).
Contemporary political sociology takes these questions seriously, but it is concerned with the play of power and politics across societies, which includes, but is not restricted to, relations between the state and society.  In part, this is a product of the growing complexity of social relations, the impact of social movement organising, and the relative weakening of the state as a result of globalization.  In large part, however, it is due to the radical rethinking of social theory. This is as much focused now on micro questions (such as the formation of identity through social interaction, the politics of knowledge, and the effects of the contestation of meaning on structures), as it is on macro questions (such as how to capture and use state power).  Chief influences here include cultural studies (Stuart Hall), post-structuralism (Michel Foucault, Judith Butler), pragmatism (Luc Boltanski), structuration theory (Anthony Giddens), and cultural sociology (Jeffrey C. Alexander).
Political sociology attempts to explore the dynamics between the two institutional systems introduced by the advent of Western capitalist system that are the democratic constitutional liberal state and the capitalist economy. While democracy promises impartiality and legal equality before all citizens, the capitalist system results in unequal economic power and thus possible political inequality as well.
For pluralists,Dahl, R. (1989). Democracy and its Critics, New Haven the distribution of political power is not determined by economic interests but by multiple social divisions and political agendas. The diverse political interests and beliefs of different factions work together through collective organizations to create a flexible and fair representation that in turn influences political parties which make the decisions. The distribution of power is then achieved through the interplay of contending interest groups. The government in this model functions just as a mediating broker and is free from control by any economic power. This pluralistic democracy however requires the existence of an underlying framework that would offer mechanisms for citizenship and expression and the opportunity to organize representations through social and industrial organizations, such as trade unions. Ultimately, decisions are reached through the complex process of bargaining and compromise between various groups pushing for their interests. Many factors, pluralists believe, have ended the domination of the political sphere by an economic elite. The power of organized labor and the increasingly interventionist state have placed restrictions on the power of capital to manipulate and control the state. Additionally, capital is no longer owned by a dominant class, but by an expanding managerial sector and diversified shareholders, none of whom can exert their will upon another.
The pluralist emphasis on fair representation however overshadows the constraints imposed on the extent of choice offered. Bachrauch and BaratzBachrach, P. and M. Baratz (1963). Decision and non-decisions. American Political Science Review, Vol 57 (1963) examined the deliberate withdrawal of certain policies from the political arena. For example, organized movements that express what might seem as radical change in a society can often by portrayed as illegitimate.
Additionally, neo-pluralists critics have observed the unfair capacity of different interest groups to mobilize economic resources as to participate in lobbying for their goals. A truly pluralist society is consequently not compatible with the patterns of socioeconomic inequalities that prevail.

The Battle of Pea Ridge (also known as the Battle of Elkhorn Tavern) was a land battle of the American Civil War, fought on March 6–8, 1862, at Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas, near Garfield. Union forces led by Brig. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis moved south from central Missouri, driving Confederate forces into northwestern Arkansas. Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn reorganized the Confederate army and launched a counter-offensive, hoping that a victory would enable the Confederates to recapture northern Arkansas and Missouri. In a two–day battle, Curtis held off the Confederate attack on the first day and drove Van Dorn's force off the field on the second day. The outcome of the battle essentially cemented Union control of Missouri and northern Arkansas. The battle was one of the few during the war in which a Confederate army outnumbered its Union opponent.

[[Echo chamber]]
CATEGORIES: Sound recording technology

An echo chamber, actually a misnomer, is a hollow enclosure used to produce reverberated sounds, usually for recording purposes.  For example, the producers of a television or radio program might wish to produce the aural illusion that a conversation is taking place in a large room or a cave; these effects might be accomplished by playing the recording of the conversation inside an echo chamber, with an accompanying microphone to catch the reverberation.
In music, the use of acoustic echo and reverberation effects has taken many forms and dates back many hundreds of years. Medieval and Renaissance sacred music relied heavily on the composers' extensive understanding and use of the complex natural reverberation and echoes inside churches and cathedrals. This early acoustical knowledge informed the design of opera houses and concert halls in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries; these were deliberately built to create internal reflections in order to enhance and project sound from the stage in the days before electrical amplification. Sometimes echo effects were the unintentional side effect of the architectural or engineering design, such as for the Hamilton Mausoleum in Scotland, reportedly having the longest reverberation of any building.

In Portugal, it was adapted and became pimba music. Typical schlager tracks are either sweet, highly sentimental ballads with a simple, catchy melody or light pop tunes. Lyrics typically center on love, relationships and feelings. The northern variant of schlager (notably in Finland) has taken elements from Nordic and Slavic folk songs, with lyrics tending towards melancholic and elegiac themes. Musically, schlager bears similarities to styles such as easy listening music.
The word schlager is also a loanword in some languages (Hungarian, Russian,БСЭ Hebrew,:he:שלאגר Romanian,Definitie Dex for example), where it retained its meaning of a "(musical) hit". The style has been frequently represented at the Eurovision Song Contest and has been popular since it originated in 1956, although it is gradually being replaced by other pop music styles.

During Franco's dictatorship, there were many attempts to create stable institutions that did not (at least directly) emanate from the dictator as they did in the post-war period. The Fundamental Laws of the Realm (Spanish: Leyes Fundamentales del Reino) were a constitution in parts enacted through nearly 20 years starting in the 1950s. They established the very institutions that would later, under Juan Carlos I and Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez, commit "constitutional suicide" and pass the Political Reform Act, starting the Spanish transition to democracy. Most of those Laws theoretically provided for a quite free state, much in the fashion the Soviet constitutions granted many freedoms, but ultimately the power of the Caudillo was supreme.

The first release under the Neutral Milk Hotel moniker was the 1994 EP Everything Is, a short collection of tracks featuring Mangum.

[[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]]

CATEGORIES: Remotely operated underwater vehicles, Robotic submarines

A remotely operated underwater vehicle, commonly referred to as an ROV, is a tethered underwater vehicle. They are common in deep water industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction. While the traditional abbreviation "ROV" stands for remotely operated vehicle, one must distinguish it from remote control vehicles operating on land or in the air. ROVs are unoccupied, highly maneuverable, and operated by a crew aboard a vessel. They are linked to the ship by either a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough conditions or in deeper water, a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-class ROVs, a separate assembly which sits on top of the ROV. The purpose of the TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an armored cable that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electrical power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable. Once at the ROV, the electrical power is distributed between the components of the ROV. However, in high-power applications, most of the electrical power drives a high-power electrical motor which drives a hydraulic pump. The hydraulic pump is then used for propulsion and to power equipment such as torque tools and manipulator arms where electrical motors would be too difficult to implement subsea. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle’s capabilities. These may include sonars, magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound velocity, light penetration, and temperature.

Tax deduction is a reduction of the income subject to tax, for various items, especially expenses incurred to produce income.
Often these deductions are subject to limitations or conditions. Tax deductions generally are allowed only for expenses incurred that produce current benefits, and capitalization of items producing future benefit is required, sometimes with exceptions. Most systems allow recovery in some manner over a period of time of capitalized business and investment items, such as through allowances for depreciation, obsolescence, or decline in value.  
Many systems reduce taxable income for personal allowances or provide a range of income subject to zero tax.  In addition, some systems allow deductions from the tax base for items the tax levying government desires to encourage.

The heavily fictionalized version of d'Artagnan featured in Dumas' works and their subsequent screen adaptations is now far more widely known than the real historical figure.

Irréversible ([tpl]IPA-fr|iʁevɛʁˈsiblə[/tpl]) is a 2002 French mystery thriller film written and directed by Gaspar Noé, starring Monica Bellucci, Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel. The film employs a non-linear narrative and follows two men as they try to avenge a brutally raped girlfriend. The soundtrack was composed by the electronic musician Thomas Bangalter, who is best known as half of the duo Daft Punk.
American film critic Roger Ebert called it "a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable.""Irreversible" rogerebert.com 14 March 2003 Retrieved 30 March 2012 Irréversible competed at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and won the Stockholm International Film Festival's award for best film.
Irreversible has been associated with a series of films defined as the cinéma du corps ("cinema of the body"), which according to Tim Palmer share affinities with certain avant-garde productions: an attenuated use of narrative, assaulting and often illegible cinematography, confrontational subject material, a pervasive sense of social nihilism or despair.Palmer, Tim (2011). Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema, Wesleyan University Press, Middleton CT. ISBN 0-8195-6827-9. Irreversible has also been associated with the New French Extremity movement.

The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded in 1949 and was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990. Its original constitution was promulgated on 7 October 1949. It was heavily based on the "Weimarer Reichsverfassung",http://web.wm.edu/law/publications/lawreview/documents/Vol49-4_Markovits.pdf?svr=law such that the GDR would be a federal and democratic republic. Because the original version did not accurately reflect the actual political climate of the GDR, it was decided in 1968 to replace the old constitution with a new version.

[[Oromëan]]
CATEGORIES: Middle-earth languages

In an older version of J.R.R. Tolkien's conception of the languages of Middle-earth as expounded in the Lhammas, Oromëan is the language family to which all Elvish languages, such as Quenya and Sindarin, belong. It is there contrasted with Aulëan, the language phylum of Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves; and with the Melkian languages of Orcs, Balrogs and other monsters.
The Oromëan languages are so named because their ancestral language supposedly derives from the speech of Oromë, the Vala of the Forest, who was the first of the Valar to meet the Elves at Cuiviénen in Middle-earth.
This concept was later dropped.

According to official Albanian government sources, he  committed suicide on December 17, 1981, after which the entire Shehu clan (his wife, Fiqirete Shehu Sanxhaktari, sons and other of his relatives) were arrested and imprisoned while Mehmet Shehu himself was denounced as "one of the most dangerous traitors and enemies of his country".Albania as dictatorship and democracy: from isolation to the Kosovo War, 1946-1998 Volume 3 of Albania in the Twentieth Century: A History, Owen Pearson Volume 3 of Albania and King Zog, Owen Pearson Author Owen Pearson Edition illustrated Publisher I.B.Tauris, 2006 ISBN 1-84511-105-2, ISBN 978-1-84511-105-2 Persistent rumors remain, however, that the murder of Shehu was ordered by Hoxha.

Chile is divided into 15 regions (in Spanish, regiones; singular región), which are the country's first-level administrative division. Each region is headed by an intendant (intendente), appointed by the President, and an indirectly-elected body known as regional board (consejo regional).
Regions are divided into provinces (second-level administrative division), each headed by a governor (gobernador), appointed by the President. There are 54 provinces, in total. Provinces are further divided into communes (third and lowest level administrative division), which are governed by municipalities.

[[Itemized deduction]]
CATEGORIES: Taxation in the United States

An itemized deduction is an eligible expense that individual taxpayers in the United States can report on their federal income tax returns in order to decrease their taxable income.
Most taxpayers are allowed a choice between the itemized deductions and the standard deduction. After computing their adjusted gross income (AGI), taxpayers can itemize their deductions (from a list of allowable items) and subtract those itemized deductions (and any applicable personal exemption deductions) from their AGI amount to arrive at their taxable income amount. Alternatively, they can elect to subtract the standard deduction for their filing status (and any applicable personal exemption deduction) to arrive at their taxable income. In other words, the taxpayer may generally deduct the total itemized deduction amount, or the standard deduction amount, whichever is greater.
The choice between the standard deduction and itemizing involves a number of factors:
Deductions are reported in the tax year in which the eligible expenses were paid. For example, an annual membership fee for a professional association paid in December 2009 for year 2010 is deductible in year 2009.

[[Optical disc drive]]

CATEGORIES: Audio storage, Optical computer storage, Optoelectronics, Video storage

In computing, an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from discs, but recent drives are commonly both readers and recorders, also called burners or writers.  Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical drive is the generic name; drives are usually described as "CD" "DVD", or "Blu-ray", followed by "drive", "writer", etc.
Optical disk drives are an integral part of stand-alone consumer appliances such as CD players, DVD players and DVD recorders.  They are also very commonly used in computers to read software and consumer media distributed on disc, and to record discs for archival and data exchange purposes. Floppy disk drives, with capacity of 1.44 MB, have been made obsolete: optical media are cheap and have vastly higher capacity to handle the large files used since the days of floppy discs, and the vast majority of computers and much consumer entertainment hardware have optical writers. USB flash drives, high-capacity, small, and inexpensive, are suitable where read/write capability is required.
Disc recording is restricted to storing files playable on consumer appliances (films, music, etc.), relatively small volumes of data (e.g., a standard DVD holds 4.7 gigabytes) for local use, and data for distribution, but only on a small-scale; mass-producing large numbers of identical discs is cheaper and faster than individual recording.
Optical discs are used to back up relatively small volumes of data, but backing up of entire hard drives, [tpl]As of|2011|lc=on[/tpl] typically containing many hundreds of gigabytes, is less practical than with the smaller capacities available previously. Large backups are often made on external hard drives, as their price has dropped to a level making this viable; in professional environments magnetic tape drives are also used.

[[Strobe light]]

CATEGORIES: Lighting, Gas discharge lamps, History of animation, 1938 introductions, Devices to alter consciousness

A strobe light or stroboscopic lamp, commonly called a strobe, is a device used to produce regular flashes of light. It is one of a number of devices that can be used as a stroboscope. The word originated from the Greek strobos, meaning "act of whirling."
A typical commercial strobe light has a flash energy in the region of 10 to 150 joules, and discharge times as short as a few milliseconds, often resulting in a flash power of several kilowatts. Larger strobe lights can be used in “continuous” mode, producing extremely intense illumination.
The light source is commonly a xenon flash lamp, or flashtube, which has a complex spectrum and a color temperature of approximately 5,600 kelvins. To obtain colored light, colored gels may be used.

The Black Rock Desert is a semi-arid region (in the Great Basin shrub steppe eco-region),  of lava beds and playa, or alkali flats, situated in the Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area, a silt playa 100 miles north of Reno that encompasses more than 300,000 acres of land and contains more than 120 miles of historic trails. It is in the northern Nevada section of the Great Basin with a lakebed that is a dry remnant of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. The average annual precipitation (years 1971-2000) at Gerlach (extreme south-west of the desert) is 7.90 inches (approx. 200 mm).http://ggweather.com/normals/NV71.htm The Great Basin, named for the geography in which water is unable to flow out and remains in the basin, is a rugged land serrated by hundreds of mountain ranges, dried by wind and sun, with spectacular skies and scenic landscapes.http://blackrockdesert.org/friends/general-information The region is notable for its paleogeologic features, as an area of 19th-century Emigrant Trails to California, as a venue for rocketry, and as an alternative to the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwestern Utah, for setting land speed records (Mach 1.02 in 1997).  It is also the location for the annual Burning Man festival.
The Black Rock Desert is part of the National Conservation Area (NCA), a unit of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS). The NCA is located in northwest Nevada, and was established by legislation in 2000. It is a unique combination of desert playa, narrow canyons, and mountainous areas.
Humans have been in Black Rock Desert since approximately 11,000 BC. In 1300 BC the area was settled by the Paiute people. The large black rock formation was used as a landmark by the Paiute and later emigrants crossing the area. The landmark is a conical outcrop composed of interbedded Permian marine limestone and volcanic rocks.Gianella, V. P., and Larson, E. R., 1960, Marine Permian at Black Rock, Nevada: Geol. Soc. Amer, Abstract of meetings, Vancouver  At its base is a large hot spring and grassy meadow, which was an important place for those crossing the desert headed for California and Oregon. In 1843, John Fremont and his party were the first white men to cross the desert, and his trail was used by over half the 22,000 gold seekers headed to California after 1849. In 1867, Hardin City, a short-lived silver mill town was established (now a ghost town).

[[Due diligence]]

CATEGORIES: Finance, American legal terms, Criminal law, Contract law

"Due diligence" is a term used for a number of concepts, involving either an investigation of a business or person prior to signing a contract, or an act with a certain standard of care.
It can be a legal obligation, but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary investigations. A common example of due diligence in various industries is the process through which a potential acquirer evaluates a target company or its assets for an acquisition.[tpl]cite book |last=Hoskisson |first=Robert E. |last2=Hitt |first2=Michael A. |last3=Ireland |first3=R. Duane |year=2004 |title=Competing for Advantage |location=Mason, OH |publisher=South-Western/Thomson Learning |page=251 |isbn=0-324-27158-1 [/tpl] The theory behind due diligence holds that performing this type of investigation contributes significantly to informed decision making by enhancing the amount and quality of information available to decision makers and by ensuring that this information is systematically used to deliberate in a reflexive manner on the decision at hand and all its costs, benefits, and risks.

[[National Assembly (France)]]

CATEGORIES: National lower houses, Government of France, National Assembly of France

The National Assembly ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Assemblée nationale[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-fr|a.sɑ̃.ble.na.sjɔˈnal|pron[/tpl]) is the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of France under the Fifth Republic. The upper house is the Senate ("Sénat"). The National Assembly's members are known as députés ([tpl]IPA-fr|depyˈte[/tpl]; "delegate" or "envoy" in English; the word is an etymological cognate of the English word "deputy", usually "adjoint" in French).
There are 577 députés, each elected by a single-member constituency through a two-rounds system. 289 seats are therefore required for a majority. The assembly is presided over by a president (currently Claude Bartolone), normally from the largest party represented, assisted by vice-presidents from across the represented political spectrum. The term of the National Assembly is five years; however, the President of the Republic may dissolve the Assembly (thereby calling for new elections) unless he has dissolved it in the preceding twelve months. This measure is becoming rarer since the 2000 referendum reduced the President's term from seven to five years: a President usually has a majority elected in the Assembly two months after him, and it would be useless for him to dissolve it for those reasons.
Following a tradition started by the first National Assembly during the French Revolution, the "left-wing" parties sit to the left as seen from the president's seat, and the "right-wing" parties sit to the right, and the seating arrangement thus directly indicates the political spectrum as represented in the Assembly. The official seat of the National Assembly is the Palais Bourbon on the banks of the river Seine ([tpl]coord|48.861899|2.318605[/tpl]); the Assembly also uses other neighbouring buildings, including the Immeuble Chaban-Delmas on the rue de l'Université ([tpl]coord|48.860799|2.315902[/tpl]). It is guarded by Republican Guards.

Historically, the Mac OS used a form of memory management that has fallen out of favour in modern systems. Criticism of this approach was one of the key areas addressed by the change to [tpl]nowrap|OS X[/tpl].
The original problem for the engineers of the Macintosh was how to make optimum use of the 128 KB of RAM that the machine was equipped with. Since at that time the machine could only run one application program at a time, and there was no fixed secondary storage, the engineers implemented a simple scheme which worked well with those particular constraints. However, that design choice did not scale well with the development of the machine, creating various difficulties for both programmers and users.

[[Standard deduction]]

CATEGORIES: United States federal income tax

The standard deduction, as defined under United States tax law, is a dollar amount that non-itemizers may subtract from their income and is based upon filing status.  It is available to US citizens and resident aliens (for tax purposes) who are individuals, married persons, and heads of household and increases every year.  It is not available to nonresident aliens residing in the United States (with few exceptions, for example, students from India on F1 visa status can use the standard deduction). Additional amounts are available for persons who are blind and/or are at least 65 years of age.I.R.C. §§ 63(c)(3), 63(f)(1)(A), 63(f)(2) (2007).   The standard deduction is distinct from personal exemptions, which also are available to all taxpayers and dependents.See I.R.C. § 151 (2007)  As one may not take both itemized deductions and a standard deduction, taxpayers generally choose the deduction that results in the lesser amount of tax owed.Samuel A.

The  Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus) is a large gull that breeds on the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is migratory, wintering from the British Isles south to West Africa. It is a regular winter visitor to the east coast of North America, probably from the breeding population in Iceland.
This species breeds colonially on coasts and lakes, making a lined nest on the ground or a cliff. Normally, three eggs are laid. In some cities the species nests within the urban environment, often in association with Herring Gulls.The Urban Gull – a new phenomenon(retrieved 15 September 2009)]
They are smaller than the Herring Gull. The taxonomy of the Herring Gull / Lesser Black-backed Gull complex is very complicated; different authorities recognise between two and eight species. This group has a ring distribution around the northern hemisphere. Differences between adjacent forms in this ring are fairly small, but by the time the circuit is completed, the end members, Herring Gull and Lesser Black-backed Gull, are clearly different species. The Lesser Black-backed Gull measures [tpl]convert|51|-|64|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], [tpl]convert|124|-|150|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] across the wings and weighs [tpl]convert|452|-|1100|g|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], with the nominate race averaging slightly smaller than the other two subspecies.Lesser Black-backed Gull, Cornell Lab of Ornithology Males, at average weight of [tpl]convert|824|g|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], are slightly larger than females, at an average of [tpl]convert|708|g|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is [tpl]convert|38.3|to|45|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], the bill is [tpl]convert|4.2|to|5.8|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and the tarsus is [tpl]convert|5.2|to|6.9|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].Gulls: Of North America, Europe, and Asia by Klaus Malling Olsen & Hans Larsson.

A confusable species in Europe is Great Black-backed Gull. The Lesser is a much smaller bird, with slimmer build, yellow rather than pinkish legs, and smaller white "mirrors" at the wing tips. The adults have black or dark grey wings (depending on race) and back. The bill is yellow with a red spot which young peck at, inducing feeding (see fixed action pattern). The head is greyer in winter, unlike Great Black-backed.
Young birds have scaly black-brown upperparts and a neat wing pattern. They take four years to reach maturity. Identification from juvenile Herring Gulls is most readily done by the more solidly dark (unbarred) tertial feathers.
The call is a "laughing" cry like that of the Herring Gull (to which this species is closely related), but with a markedly deeper pitch.
They are omnivores like most Larus gulls, and they will eat fish, insects, crustaceans, worms, starfish, molluscs, seeds, berries, small mammals, eggs, small birds, chicks, scraps, offal, and carrion.
There are three races:

[[Compound document]]
CATEGORIES: Electronic documents, Multimedia

In computing, a compound document is a document type typically produced using word processing software, and is a regular text document intermingled with non-text elements such as spreadsheets, pictures, digital videos, digital audio, and other multimedia features. It can also be used to collect several documents into one.
Compound document technologies are commonly utilized on top of a software componentry framework, but the idea of software componentry includes several other concepts apart from compound documents, and software components alone do not enable compound documents. Well-known technologies for compound documents include:
Since many documents contain non-text elements such as spreadsheets, pictures, digital videos, digital audio, and other multimedia features is of critical importance to mitigate the risks of undetected and unapproved changes.
Software-based compound document comparison compares the entire document granularly, including the native format, in addition to embedded objects like spreadsheets and images, and creates a third document highlighting modifications through a coded system. Normally this coded system takes the form of color-coding or highlighting the changes granularly. Compound document comparison can be used on any document format including Word, WordPerfect, spreadsheets, PDFs, and PowerPoint.
The first public implementation was on the Xerox Star workstation, released in 1981.http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox-8010/index.html

The Al-Shifa (الشفاء, Arabic for "healing") pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North, Sudan, was constructed between 1992 and 1996 with components imported from the United States, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, India, and Thailand. It was officially opened on July 12, 1997.http://www.freearabvoice.org/exclusiveFavInterviewWBuilderOfSudaneseFactory.htmhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990216/text/90216w42.htm
The industrial complex was composed of around four buildings. It was the largest pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum and employed over 300 workers, producing medicine both for human and veterinary use.
The factory was destroyed in 1998 by a missile attack launched by the United States government, killing one employee and wounding eleven. Critics of the attack have estimated that up to tens of thousands of Sudanese civilians died throughout Sudan as the supply of necessary drugs was cut off.Chomsky, Noam.

[[La Pandilla]]

CATEGORIES: Spanish musical groups, Menudo (band)

La Pandilla was a teen music group of the 1970s. La Pandilla, founded in 1970 by Pepa Aguirre. The group had members of both sexes, unlike most pop music bands.
Aguirre's son and daughter, and her niece, formed the band, and later, two other boys were added to the group. La Pandilla released their first album, Villancicos, late in 1970. 
La Pandilla had initially a big impact in Spain, their home country. After a personnel change (due to some of the original members growing up), they experienced some backlash in the country for recording their song "El Alacrán" ("The Scorpion"), an innocent pop tune that made a coincidental reference to a clandestine group that was one of Francisco Franco's staunchest opponents. Franco's censors objected to the group, and as a consequence, they started touring Latin America more frequently.
Their appeal to youth in some Latin American countries bordered in collective hysteria, a reaction that evoked that of Beatlemania in the mid-1960s. During the 1970s, it was common to see La Pandilla related items such as notebooks, posters, magazines, notebook covers, rulers, dolls and others at department stores all over the Spanish speaking countries.
La Pandilla was chiefly instrumental in the later success and development of one of history's most legendary boy bands: Menudo. In 1973, the future founder of Menudo, Edgardo Diaz, who was a medical student in Spain and lived next door to the Aguirreses, joined the band's entourage as a sound expert. Diaz turned out to be the bridge between La Pandilla and Puerto Rico, the country where La Pandilla's success was longest-lived. Thanks in part to him, Alfred D. Herger (who became known as the biggest pandillero in Puerto Rico) and Felix Santiesteban, the group became a teen favorite in the Caribbean island.  Diaz became manager in 1974. In 1975, the band was received by a huge crowd of Puerto Rican fans at the Iberia Airlines terminal at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport at San Juan. Similar receptions took place in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela and other countries.
The definitive lineup of La Pandilla, which was a close-knit group, literally grew up together, along with their fans. This eventually became a liability, as the youngest members' voices matured and, by doing so, made their original sound difficult to produce. Another liability, at least in Diaz's view, was that of having a female singer, Mari Blanca, for whom separate lodging, security and chaperone arrangements had always had to be made due to her gender. This prompted Díaz to leave the management of the group and set up yet another, this time in his native Puerto Rico, in which only young males before the age of fifteen would be used and replaced when they aged. After Diaz left and formed Menudo, La Pandilla's popularity slowly declined.

[[Point-to-point protocol over Ethernet]]
CATEGORIES: Tunneling protocols, Logical link control

The Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a network protocol for encapsulating PPP frames inside Ethernet frames. It appeared at the turn of the century, in the context of the boom of the DSL as the solution for tunneling packets over the DSL connection to the ISP's IP network, and from there to the rest of the Internet. A 2005 networking book noted that "Most DSL providers use PPPoE, which provides authentication, encryption, and compression."[tpl]cite book|author=James Boney|title=Cisco IOS in a Nutshell|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zxq78zNHH7YC&pg=PA88|year=2005|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-0-596-55311-1|pages=88[/tpl] Typical use of  PPPoE involves leveraging the PPP facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password, predominately via the PAP protocol and less often via CHAP.
On the customer-premises equipment, PPPoE may be implemented either in a unified residential gateway device that handles both DSL modem and IP routing functions or in the case of a simple DSL modem (without routing support), PPPoE may be handled behind it on a separate Ethernet-only router or even directly on a user's computer. (Support for PPPoE is present in most operating systems, ranging from Windows XP,http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283070 Linuxhttp://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DSL-HOWTO/configure.html to Mac OS X.http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2301) More recently, some GPON-based (instead of DSL-based) residential gateways also use PPPoE, although the status of PPPoE in the GPON standards is marginal.
PPPoE was developed by UUNET, Redback Networks and RouterWare (now Wind River Systems) Wind River Systems Acquires RouterWare, Inc.. Findarticles.com (1999-07-05). Retrieved on 2011-09-27.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] and is available as an informational RFC 2516.
In the world of DSL, PPPoE was commonly understood to be running on top of ATM (of DSL) as the underlying transport, although no such limitation exists in the PPPoE protocol itself. Other usage scenarios are sometimes distinguished by tacking as a suffix another underlying transport. For example PPPoEoE, when the transport is Ethernet itself, as in the case of Metro Ethernet networks. (In this notation, the original use of PPPoE would be labeled PPPoEoA, although it should not be confused with PPPoA, which is a different encapsulation protocol.)
PPPoE has been described in some books as a "layer 2.5" protocol,[tpl]cite book|author1=Philip Golden|author2=Hervé Dedieu|author3=Krista S. Jacobsen|title=Implementation and Applications of DSL Technology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jjkd74jY47oC&pg=PA479|year=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-4200-1307-8|page=479[/tpl] in some rudimentary sense similar to MPLS because it can be used to distinguish different IP flows sharing an Ethernet infrastructure, although the lack of PPPoE switches making routing decision based on PPPoE headers limits applicability in that respect.[tpl]cite book|author=Michael Beck|title=Ethernet in the First Mile : The IEEE 802.3ah EFM Standard|year=2005|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-146991-3|page=27[/tpl]

[[Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM]]

CATEGORIES: Tunneling protocols

The Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) is a network protocol for encapsulating PPP frames in AAL5. It is used mainly with DOCSIS and DSL carriers.
It offers standard PPP features such as authentication, encryption, and compression. If it is used as the connection encapsulation method on an ATM based network it can reduce overhead slightly (around 0.58%) in comparison to PPPoE. It also avoids the issues that PPPoE suffers from, related to having a MTU lower than that of standard Ethernet transmission protocols. It also supports (as does PPPoE) the encapsulation types: VC-MUX and LLC based.
Point-to-Point Protocol over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (PPPoA) is specified by The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 2364.[tpl]cite journal|title=RFC 2364, PPP over AAL5|year=1998|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2364|accessdate=2013-04-15|publisher=IETF|ref=rfc:2364[/tpl]
The use of PPPoA over PPPoE is not geographically significant; rather, it varies by the provider's preference.

Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovsky ([tpl]lang-ru|Михаи́л Бори́сович Ходорко́вский[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ru|mʲɪxɐˈil xədɐˈrkofskʲɪj|IPA[/tpl]; born 26 June 1963) is a Russian businessman and former oligarch,Khodorkovsky: an oligarch undone, BBC News, 31 May 2005. as well as philanthropist, public figure and author.
In 2003 Khodorkovsky and Roman Abramovich were jointly named as Person of the Year by Expert. In 2004, Khodorkovsky was the wealthiest man in Russia (with a fortune of over $15 billion) and one of the richest people in the world, ranked 16th on Forbes list of billionaires. He had worked his way up the Communist apparatus during the Soviet years, and began several businesses during the era of glasnost and perestroika. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he accumulated wealth through the development of Siberian oil fields as the head of Yukos, one of the largest Russian companies to emerge from the privatization of state assets during the 1990s. [tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
He was arrested on 25 October 2003, to appear before investigators as a witness, but within hours of being taken into custody he was charged with fraud. The government under Vladimir Putin then froze shares of Yukos shortly thereafter on tax charges. The state took further actions against Yukos, leading to a collapse of the company's share price and the evaporation of much of Khodorkovsky's wealth. He was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison in May 2005. While still serving his sentence, Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were further charged and found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering in December 2010, extending his prison sentence to 2014. After Hans-Dietrich Genscher's impassioned lobbying for his release, President Vladimir Putin pardoned him, releasing him from jail on 20 December 2013.Erklärung von Chodorkowski: "Mein besonderer Dank gilt Hans-Dietrich Genscher", Der Spiegel.
There is widespread concern internationally that the trials and sentencing were politically motivated.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/27/wikileaks-russia-mikhail-khodorkovsky-trial|title=WikiLeaks: rule of law in Mikhail Khodorkovsky trial merely 'gloss'|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=28 December 2010|first=Tom|last=Parfitt|date=27 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Russian businessmen declared prisoners of conscience after convictions are upheld|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/russian-businessmen-declared-prisoners-conscience-after-convictions-are-uph|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate= 29 September 2011[/tpl] The trial process has received criticism from abroad for its lack of due process. Khodorkovsky lodged several applications to the European Court of Human Rights, seeking redress for alleged violations by Russia of his human rights.

[[ISDN digital subscriber line]]

CATEGORIES: Digital subscriber line, Integrated Services Digital Network

ISDN Digital Subscriber Line (IDSL)  uses ISDN-based digital subscriber line technology to provide a data communication channel across existing copper telephone lines at a rate of 144 kbit/s, slightly higher than a bonded dual channel ISDN connection at 128kbit/s. The digital transmission bypasses the telephone company's central office equipment that handles analogue signals.  IDSL uses the ISDN grade loop without Basic Rate Interface in ISDN transmission mode.  The benefits of IDSL over ISDN are that IDSL provides always-on connections and transmits data via a data network rather than the carrier's voice network.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk175/tk349/technologies_q_and_a_item09186a00800946d3.shtml|title=IDSL Frequently Asked Questions|date=February 26, 2008|publisher=Cisco[/tpl]
IDSL also avoids per-call fees by being generally billed at a flat-rate.
IDSL is not available in all countries.
ISDN digital subscriber line (IDSL) is a cross between ISDN and xDSL. It is like ISDN in that it uses a single-wire pair to transmit full-duplex data at 128 kbit/s and at distances of up to RRD range. Like ISDN, IDSL uses a 2B1Q line code to enable transparent operation through the ISDN U interface. Finally, the user continues to use existing CPE (ISDN BRI terminal adapters, bridges, and routers) to make the CO connections. 
The big difference is from the carrier's point-of-view. Unlike ISDN, IDSL does not connect through the voice switch. A new piece of data communications equipment terminates the IDSL connection and shunts it off to a router or data switch. This is a key feature because the overloading of central office voice switches by data users is a growing problem for telcos. 
The limitation of IDSL is that the customer no longer has access to ISDN signaling or voice services. But for Internet service providers, who do not provide a public voice service, IDSL is an alternative way of using POTS dial service to offer higher-speed Internet access, targeting the embedded base of more than five million ISDN users as an initial market.

[[Copa Libertadores]]
CATEGORIES: Copa Libertadores, CONMEBOL club competitions

The Copa Libertadores de América (Portuguese: Copa Libertadores da América) is an annual international club football competition organized by CONMEBOL since 1960. It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in South American football. The tournament is named in honor of the Libertadores (Portuguese and Spanish for liberators), the main leaders of the South American wars of independence, so a literal translation of its name into English would be the "Liberators of America Cup".
It is currently sponsored by Bridgestone and thus currently known as the Copa Bridgestone Libertadores for sponsorship reasons. The competition has had several different formats over its lifetime. Initially, only the champions of the South American leagues participated. In 1966, the runners-up of the South American leagues began to join. In 1998, Mexican teams were invited to compete, contesting regularly since the 2000 edition, when the tournament was expanded from 20 to 32 teams. Today at least three clubs per country compete in the tournament, while Argentina and Brazil each have five clubs participating. Traditionally, a group stage has always been used but the number of teams per group has varied several times.
In the present format, the tournament consists of six stages, with the first stage taking place in early February. The six surviving teams from the first stage join 26 teams in the second stage, in which there are eight groups consisting of four teams each. The eight group winners and eight runners-up enter the final four stages, better known as the knockout stages, which ends with the finals anywhere between June and August. The winner of the Copa Libertadores becomes eligible to play in two extra tournaments: the FIFA Club World Cup and the Recopa Sudamericana.
Argentine club Independiente is the most successful club in the cup history, having won the tournament 7 times. Argentine clubs have accumulated the most victories with 22 wins while Brazil has the largest number of different winning teams, with a total of 10 clubs having won the title. The cup has been won by 24 different clubs, 12 of which have won the title more than once, and won consecutively by six clubs, most recently by Boca Juniors in 2001. The reigning champion of the competition were Brazilian side Atlético Mineiro, who won their first title after beating Olimpia of Paraguay.

In 1815, the  German geologist Leopold von Buch visited the Canary Islands. It was as a result of his visit to Tenerife where he visited the Las Cañadas caldera and then La Palma where he visited the Taburiente caldera, that the Spanish word for cauldron - "caldera" - was introduced into the English language geological vocabulary.  La Palma has "sister city" status with El Dorado Hills, California, United States.

[[Structural engineer]]
CATEGORIES: Structural engineers, Building engineering, Engineering occupations

Structural engineers analyze, design, plan, and research structural components and structural systems to achieve design goals and ensure the safety and comfort of users or occupants. Their work takes account mainly of safety, technical, economic and environmental concerns, but they may also consider aesthetic and social factors.
Structural engineering is usually considered a specialty discipline within civil engineering, but it can also be studied in its own right. In the US, most practicing structural engineers are currently licensed as civil engineers, but the situation varies from state to state. In the UK, most structural engineers in the building industry are members of the Institution of Structural Engineers rather than the Institution of Civil Engineers.
Typical structures designed by a structural engineer include buildings, towers, stadia and bridges. Other structures such as oil rigs, space satellites, aircraft and ships may also be designed by a structural engineer.Institution of Structural Engineer, What do they do?, viewed on 22 May 2007 Most structural engineers are employed in the construction industry, however there are also structural engineers in the aerospace, automobile and shipbuilding industries. In the construction industry, they work closely with architects, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, quantity surveyors, and construction managers.
Structural engineers ensure that buildings and bridges are built to be strong enough and stable enough to resist all appropriate structural loads (e.g., gravity, wind, snow, rain, seismic (earthquake), earth pressure, temperature, and traffic) in order to prevent or reduce loss of life or injury. They also design structures to be stiff enough to not deflect or vibrate beyond acceptable limits.  Human comfort is an issue that is regularly considered in the limits.  Fatigue is also an important consideration for bridges and for aircraft design or for other structures which experience a large number of stress cycles over their lifetimes.  Consideration is also given to durability of materials against possible deterioration which may impair performance over the design lifetime.

Cambuskenneth Abbey is a ruined Augustinian monastery located on an area of land enclosed by a meander of the River Forth near Stirling in Scotland.  The abbey is largely reduced to its foundations.  The neighbouring modern village of Cambuskenneth is named after it.
Cambuskenneth Abbey was founded by order of David I around the year 1140.  Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it was initially known as the Abbey of St Mary of Stirling and sometimes simply as Stirling Abbey.  The major street leading down the castle hill from the royal residences in Stirling Castle to the abbey was called St. Mary's Wynd, a name it retains.
Cambuskenneth was one of the more important abbeys in Scotland, due in part to its proximity to the Royal Burgh of Stirling, a leading urban centre of the country and sometime capital. Its status as a royal abbey in the neighbourhood of a major national stronghold may be compared to that of Holyrood Abbey vis à vis Edinburgh.  Royalty, including Edward Longshanks (King of England) and later Robert the Bruce (King of Scots), prayed regularly at the abbey. Bruce held his parliament there in 1326 to confirm the succession of his son David II.
In 1486 Margaret of Denmark died at Stirling Castle and was buried at the abbey. In 1488 her husband James III was murdered at the Battle of Sauchieburn and his body was brought to Cambuskenneth Abbey for burial. The elaborate marker of his grave, which was funded by Queen Victoria, is still visible at one end of the church.
The abbey fell into disuse during the Scottish Reformation.  By 1559 there were few monks remaining there, and the abbey was closed and most of the buildings looted and burned. The abbey was placed under the jurisdiction of the military governor of Stirling Castle, who had much of the stonework removed and used in construction projects in the castle.
Of the once wealthy abbey, mostly only knee-high ruins and exposed foundations remain.  Only the 13th century campanile is intact, following an extensive renovation in 1859.  The abbey was acquired by the crown in 1908, and it is presently managed by Historic Scotland.  The abbey is open to visitors during the summer months. Visitors can enter the base room of the campanile; the stairs to the upper floors are locked, but are opened for visitors on occasion.

Kerry Lee Wood (born June 16, 1977) is a retired American Major League Baseball pitcher. During his career he played for the Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, and New York Yankees. Wood first came to prominence as a twenty-year old rookie when he recorded twenty strikeouts in a one-hit shutout against the Houston Astros, which some have argued may be the greatest single-game pitching performance in Major League Baseball history.http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/eye-on-baseball/22206628/happy-15th-anniversary-kerry-woods-20-strikeout-gamehttp://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/24585/kerry-wood-and-the-greatest-game-pitched The game also made Wood the co-holder of the MLB record for strikeouts in a single game (20), and earned Wood the nickname Kid K. He was later named the 1998 National League Rookie of the Year. Wood would go on to record over 200 strikeouts in four out of his first five seasons, with a high of 266 in 2003, and holds several MLB strikeout records.

Acoustical engineering (also known as Acoustic Engineering) is the branch of engineering dealing with sound and vibration.  It is the application of acoustics, the science of sound and vibration, in technology. Acoustical engineers are typically concerned with the design, analysis and control of sound.
One goal of acoustical engineering can be the reduction of unwanted noise, which is referred to as noise control.

[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth books, Middle-earth poetry, 1962 books, Poetry by J. R. R. Tolkien, English poetry collections, Allen & Unwin books

The Adventures of Tom Bombadil is a collection of poetry written by J. R. R. Tolkien and published in 1962. The book contains 16 poems, three of which deal with Tom Bombadil (two specifically about Tom, and he also appears in the poem; The Stone Troll), a character who is most famous for his encounter with Frodo Baggins in The Fellowship of the Ring (the first volume in Tolkien's best-selling The Lord of the Rings).  The rest of the poems are an assortment of bestiary verse and fairy tale rhyme. Three of the poems appear in The Lord of the Rings as well. The book is part of Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium and the Middle-earth canon.
The volume includes what W. H. Auden considered Tolkien's best poem, The Sea-Bell, subtitled Frodos Dreme. It is a piece of great metrical and rhythmical complexity that recounts a journey to a strange land beyond the sea. Drawing on medieval 'dream vision' poetry and Irish 'immram'[tpl]Citation needed|reason=were did Tolkien say this? This runs contrary to his view that Irish folklore and poetry contains no beauty|date=February 2009[/tpl] poems the piece is markedly melancholic and the final note is one of alienation and disillusion.
The book was originally illustrated by Pauline Baynes and later by Roger Garland.
The book, like the first edition of The Fellowship of the Ring, is presented as if it is an actual translation from the Red Book of Westmarch, and contains some background information on the world of Middle-earth which is not found elsewhere: e.g. the name of the tower at Dol Amroth and the names of the Seven Rivers of Gondor. There is also some fictional 'background' information of those poems, linking them to the Hobbit folklore and literature as well as their actual writers (some of them were written by Samwise Gamgee).
The book is also notable because it uses the letter "K" instead of "C" for the /k/ sound in Sindarin, a spelling variant Tolkien alternated many times in his writings.

Shāh 'Abbās the Great (or Shāh 'Abbās I) ([tpl]lang-fa|شاه عَباس بُزُرگ[/tpl]) 
(27 January 1571 – 19 January 1629) was the 5th Safavid Shah (king) of Iran, and generally considered the greatest ruler of the Safavid dynasty. He was the third son of Shah Mohammad.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 1
Although Abbas would preside over the apex of the Safavid Empire's military, political and economic power, he came to the throne during a troubled time for Iran. Under his weak-willed father, the country was riven with discord between the different factions of the Qizilbash army, who killed Abbas' mother and elder brother. Meanwhile, Iran's enemies, the Ottoman Empire and the Uzbeks, exploited this political chaos to seize territory for themselves. In 1588, one of the Qizilbash leaders, Murshid Qoli Khan, overthrew Shah Mohammed in a coup and placed the 16-year-old Abbas on the throne. But Abbas was no puppet and soon seized power for himself. 
With his leadership and the help of the newly created layers in his Persian society, started and created by his predecessors but significantly expanded under Abbas and composed of hundreds of thousands of Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians he managed to completely crush the power of the Qizilbash in the civil administration, royal house, and the military. By this and his reformings of the army, it enabled him to fight the Ottomans and Uzbeks and reconquer Iran's lost provinces. He also took back land from the Portuguese and the Mughals, and expanded Iranian rule and influence in the North Caucasus. Abbas was a great builder and moved his kingdom's capital from Qazvin to Isfahan, making the city the pinnacle of Safavid architecture. In his later years, the shah became suspicious of his own sons and had them killed or blinded.

[[Detachable chairlift]]

CATEGORIES: Vertical transport devices, Aerial lifts, Ski lift types

A detachable chairlift or high-speed chairlift is a type of passenger aerial lift, which, like a fixed-grip chairlift, consists of numerous chairs attached to a constantly moving wire rope (called a haul rope) that is strung between two (or more) terminals over intermediate towers. They are now commonplace at all but the smallest of ski resorts. Some are installed at tourist attractions as well as for urban transportation.
The significance of detachable chairlift technology is primarily the speed and capacity.  Detachable chairlifts move far faster than their fixed-grip brethren, averaging 1,200 feet per minute (14 mph, 22 km/h, 6 m/s) versus a typical fixed-grip speed of 500 ft/min (6 mph, 9 km/h, 2.5 m/s). Because the cable moves faster than most passengers could safely disembark and load, each chair is connected to the cable by a powerful spring-loaded cable grip which detaches at terminals, allowing the chair to slow considerably for convenient loading and unloading at a typical speed of 200 ft/min (2 mph, 4 km/h, 1 m/s), a speed slower even than fixed-grip bunny chairlifts.
Another advantage of detaching chairs is the ability to remove chairs during severe weather in order to reduce stress on the rope and towers. Furthermore, operating the unladen rope during extreme weather is effective at preventing—or greatly reducing—ice and snow accumulation on the sheaves and rope. This saves considerable time, expense and hazard when opening the chair for operation, which would otherwise require workers to climb each tower and chip away ice and shovel snow.
Chairlifts are made in a variety of sizes, carrying from 2 to 8 passengers. All chairs on a given chairlift usually have the same capacity. Slang terms for the different sizes include "doubles", "triples", "quads", and "six packs". Detachable chairlifts may also be described as "high speed" or "express", which results in terms such as "high speed quad" and "express quad".
Some detachable chairlifts have so-called bubble chairs, which add a retractable acrylic glass dome to protect passengers from weather.
An alternative system for reconciling slow boarding speeds with fast rope speeds is the carpet lift:  the chairs move at full speed even through the terminal.  Boarding passengers are progressively accelerated on a system of conveyor belts of carpet-like material until nearly matching the chair speed.
On Sunday, 26 December 2004, Lech am Arlberg and Schröcken in the Bregenzerwald, became the first chairlifts to have heated seats when five Doppelmayr detachable chairlifts offer skiers the added luxury of a warm seat on the uphill trip.

[[Structural information theory]]
CATEGORIES: Perception, Information theory, Cognitive neuroscience

Structural information theory (SIT) is a theory about human perception and in particular about perceptual organization. which is the neuro-cognitive process that enables us to perceive scenes as structured wholes consisting of objects arranged in space.. SIT was initiated, in the 1960s, by Emanuel LeeuwenbergLeeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1968). Structural information of visual patterns: an efficient coding system in perception. The Hague: Mouton.Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1969). Quantitative specification of information in sequential patterns. Psychological Review, 76, 216-220.Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1971). A perceptual coding language for visual and auditory patterns. American Journal of Psychology, 84, 307-349. and has been developed further by Hans Buffart, Peter A. van der Helm, and Rob van Lier. It has been applied to a wide range of research topics,Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. & van der Helm, P. A. (2013). Structural information theory: The simplicity of visual form. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. mostly in visual form perception but also in, for instance, visual ergonomics, data visualization, and music perception.
SIT began as a quantitative model of visual pattern classification. Nowadays, it includes quantitative models of symmetry perception and amodal completion, and is theoretically sustained by a perceptually adequate formalization of visual regularity, a quantitative account of viewpoint dependencies, and a powerful form of neurocomputation. van der Helm, P. A. (2014). Simplicity in vision: A multidisciplinary account of perceptual organization. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. SIT has been argued to be the best defined and most successful extension of Gestalt ideas.Palmer, S. E. (1999).  Vision science: Photons to phenomenology. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. It is the only Gestalt approach providing a formal calculus that generates plausible perceptual interpretations.

CATEGORIES: Types of country subdivisions, Local government in the United States, County government in the United States, Consolidated city-counties in the United States

In United States local government, a consolidated city-county is a city and county that have been merged into one unified jurisdiction. As such it is simultaneously a city, which is a municipal corporation, and a county, which is an administrative division of a state. It has the powers and responsibilities of both types of entities.
A consolidated city-county is different from an independent city, although the latter may result from consolidation of a city and a county and may also have the same powers as a consolidated city-county. An independent city is a city not deemed by its state to be located within the boundary of any county, and recognized by its state as a legal territorial entity separate from surrounding or adjoining counties. Not considering Hawaii, which has no independent cities, the Midwest and Upper South have the highest concentration of large consolidated city-county governments in the United States, including Indianapolis, Indiana; Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Louisville, Kentucky; Kansas City, Kansas; and Lexington, Kentucky. Currently, the largest consolidated city-county in the United States by population is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, while the largest by land-area is Sitka, Alaska.

Bharata ([tpl]lang-sa|भरत[/tpl]) was an ancient Indian theatrologist and musicologist who authored the  Natya Shastra, a theoretical treatise on ancient Indian dramaturgy and histrionics, especially Sanskrit theatre. It is dated to between 1st-century BC to 3rd-century CE.[tpl]cite web |title=Natyashastra (Indian drama treatise) |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64008/Bharata |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=[/tpl]
Indian dance and music find their root in the Natyashastra. Besides propounding the theory of three types of acting Bharata has discussed in detail classical Indian vocal/instrumental music and dance since they are integral to Sanskrit drama. Bharata classified Sanskrit theatrical forms (Natya/Rupaka) into ten types; what is known to the west as drama is but one among these, namely, Nataka.
Bharata also outlines a set of rasas or moods/emotions which were to be influential in defining the nature of Indian dance, music, and theater.
The Natyashastra comprises 36 chapters and it is possible that it was a creation of more than one scholar. Bharata is considered as the father of Indian theatrical art forms.

[[Manuel A. Odría]]

Manuel Arturo Odría Amoretti (November 26, 1896 – February 18, 1974) was the President of Peru from 1948 to 1956.
Manuel Odría was born in 1896 in Tarma, a city in the central Andes just east of Lima.  He graduated first in his class from the Chorillos Military Academy in 1915.  He joined the army and as a Lieutenant Colonel was a war hero in the 1941 Ecuadorian-Peruvian war.  He soon achieved the rank of Major General.
In 1945, José Bustamante had attained the presidency with the help of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA). Soon, major disagreements arose between Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the founder of APRA, and President Bustamante. The President disbanded his Aprista cabinet and replaced it with a mostly military one. Odría, a fierce opponent of APRA, was appointed Minister of Government and Police. In 1948, Odría and other right-wing elements urged Bustamante to ban APRA. When the President refused, Odría resigned his post. On October 27, 1948, he led a successful military coup against the government and took over as president.  After two years, he resigned and had one of his colleagues, Zenón Noriega, take office as a puppet president so he could run for president as a civilian. He was duly elected a month later as the only candidate.
Odría came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but like Juan Perón, he followed a populist course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes.  A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies.  At the same time, however, civil rights were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his régime.  It was feared that his dictatorship would run indefinitely so it came as a surprise when Odría legalized opposition parties in 1956 and called fresh elections—in which he would not be a candidate.  He was succeeded by a former president, Manuel Prado.
National elections were again held in 1962 and Odría ran as a right-wing candidate for the Unión Nacional Odriista party. The initial election found none of the three major candidates - Odría, Haya de la Torre and Fernando Belaúnde - receiving the required one third of the vote.  It appeared that Odría would win the Presidency in Congress, after having made a deal with Haya de la Torre, but a military coup removed President Prado from office only a few days before his term ended. Elections were again held in 1963 with the same three major candidates. This time Belaúnde won with 39% of the vote.Peru, Revolution Within the Law, TIME Magazine: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940508,00.html
During the Belaúnde Administration, Odría made an alliance with Haya de la Torre to create a single opposition block in Parliament, which became known as the APRA-UNO Coalition. As a political force, they managed to create a strong parliamentary force against President Belaúnde, who was forced to make important concessions to the Coalition in order to get most of his party-sponsored legislation enacted. The Coalition suffered a setback after losing the elections for mayor in the capital, Lima.
After the military coup that overthrew Belaúnde, Odría kept a low profile in Peruvian politics until his death in 1974.

[[Bachelor of Laws]]

CATEGORIES: Bachelor's degrees, Law degrees

The Bachelor of Laws ([tpl]lang-la|Legum Baccalaureus[/tpl]) or LL.B. is an undergraduate, or bachelor, degree in law (or a first professional degree in law, depending on jurisdiction) originating in England and offered in most common law Jurisdictions.  Professional Objectives in Legal Education: American Trends and English Comparisons,” Pressing Problems in the Law, Volume 2: What are Law Schools For?, Oxford University Press, 1996. In English-speaking Canada it is sometimes referred to as a post-graduate degree because previous university education is usually required for admission. The "LL." of the abbreviation for the degree is from the genitive plural legum (of lex, law).  Creating an abbreviation for a plural, especially from Latin, is often done by doubling the first letter (e.g. "pp" for "pages"), thus "LL.B." stands for Legum Baccalaureus in Latin. It is sometimes erroneously called "Bachelor of Legal Letters" to account for the double "L".
The United States is the only common law country that no longer offers the LL.B. While the LL.B. was conferred until 1971 at Yale University, since that time, all universities in the United States have awarded the professional doctorate J.D.,Association of American Universities Data Exchange.

Yale graduates who received LL.B. degrees prior to 1971 were similarly permitted to change their degree to a J.D., although many did not take the option, retaining their LL.B. degrees.
Historically, in Canada, Bachelor of Laws was the name of the first degree in common law, but is also the name of the first degree in Quebec civil law awarded by a number of Quebec universities. Canadian common-law LL.B. programs were, in practice, second-entry professional degrees, meaning that the vast majority of those admitted to an LL.B. programme were already holders of one or more degrees, or, at a minimum (with very few exceptions), have completed two years of study in a first-entry, undergraduate degree in another discipline.  Today in Canada the predominant first degree in common law is the Juris Doctor degree having replaced the LL.B.
Bachelor of Laws is also the name of the first degree in Scots law and South African law (both being pluralistic legal systems that are based partly on common law and partly on civil law) awarded by a number of universities in Scotland and South Africa, respectively.

Legal formalism is a legal positivist view in philosophy of law and jurisprudence. While Jeremy Bentham's legal positivism can be seen as appertaining to the legislature, legal formalism appertains to the Judge; that is, formalism does not (as positivists do) suggest that the substantive justice of a law is irrelevant, but rather, that in a democracy, that is a question for the legislature to address, not the Judge.

[[University-preparatory school]]

CATEGORIES: School types, University-preparatory schools, High schools and secondary schools

A university-preparatory school or college-preparatory school (also known as tertiary preparation and usually abbreviated to preparatory school, college prep school, tertiary prep, or prep school) is a secondary school, either public or private depending on the area, designed to prepare students for a college or university education. Some schools will also include a junior, or elementary school. 
In North America, college prep schools are usually private (independent and fee-paying) schools that focus on providing a rigorous academic education, athletic involvement, and varied extracurricular activities and leadership opportunities, on the secondary school (9th-12th-grade) level. Only 1% of U.S. and Canadian students attend college prep schools.  However, in many US cities, there are competitive, state-funded secondary schools, to which admission is gained by examination and/or academic performance, and that offer college/university preparatory educations regarded as equal to those at the best-known independent schools.
In most parts of Europe, such as Germany, the countries of former Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Scandinavia, there are state-funded secondary schools specializing in university-preparatory education.  These go by many names depending on the country but may be called gymnasia, athenaea, a lycee or a liceo, depending on the nation.

[[Sedative]]

CATEGORIES: Sedatives

A sedative or tranquilizer (or tranquilliser, see American and British English spelling differences)  is a substance that induces sedation by reducing irritability[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hopkinscoloncancercenter.org/index.cfm?cID=194&CFID=1128737&CFTOKEN=20842936 |title=Johns Hopkins Colon Cancer Center - Glossary S |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] or excitement.[tpl]DorlandsDict|seven/000095557|sedative[/tpl]
At higher doses it may result in slurred speech, staggering gait, poor judgment, and slow, uncertain reflexes. Doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepines, when used as a hypnotic to induce sleep, tend to be higher than amounts used to relieve anxiety, whereas only low doses are needed to provide a peaceful effect.[tpl]cite journal |author=Montenegro M, Veiga H, Deslandes A, et al. |title=effects of caffeine and bromazepam on visual event-related potential (P300): a comparative study. |journal=Arq Neuropsiquiatr |volume=63 |issue=2B |pages=410–5 |date=June 2005 |pmid=16059590 |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2005000300009  |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-282X2005000300009&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en [/tpl]
Sedatives can be misused to produce an overly-calming effect (alcohol being the classic and most common sedating drug). In the event of an overdose or if combined with another sedative, many of these drugs can cause unconsciousness (see hypnotic) and even death.

[[Lebensborn]]

CATEGORIES: Children in war, Natalism, Nazi eugenics, Nazi Germany, Nazi Party organizations, Heinrich Himmler

Lebensborn e.V. (literally: Fount of Life) was an SS-borne, state-supported, registered association in Nazi Germany with the intention of raising the birth rate of "Aryan" children from extramarital relations of "racially pure and healthy" parents on the basis of Nazi racial hygiene and health ideology. Lebensborn aimed to do this by encouraging anonymous births and mediating adoption to likewise "racially pure and healthy" parents, particularly families of SS-members.
Initially set up in Germany in 1935, Lebensborn expanded into several occupied European countries with Germanic populations during the Second World War. It included the selection of "racially worthy" orphans for adoption and the birth of children from Aryan love interests of SS-members. It was not intended for children between common soldiers and foreign women, because there was no proof of racial purity on both sides.
At the Nuremberg Trials no evidence was found of direct involvement by the 'Lebensborn' organization in the kidnapping of Polish children. However, Heinrich Himmler himself directed a programme with other segments of the Nazi bureaucracy, where thousands of Polish children were kidnapped and subjected to 'Germanisation.' Germanisation involved a period at one of the 're-education camps,' followed by being fostered out to German families.

The Cloisters  is a museum located in Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, New York City. It is a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, used to exhibit the museum's extensive collection of art, architecture and artifacts from Medieval Europe. 
The Cloisters is situated on a hill overlooking the Hudson River, and incorporates parts from five European abbeys which were disassembled and shipped to New York City, where, between 1934 and 1939, they were reconstructed and integrated together with new buildings in the medieval style designed by Charles Collens. The area around the buildings was landscaped with gardens planted according to horticultural information obtained from medieval manuscripts and artifacts, and the structure includes multiple medieval-style cloistered herb gardens.
The Cloisters was designated a New York City landmark in 1974, [tpl]cite nycland[/tpl], p.213 and Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters were listed together as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The Peacock Throne (Hindustani: تخت طاؤس, मयूरासन: Mayūrāsana, [tpl]lang-fa|تخت طاووس[/tpl], Takht-i Tāvūs) was a famous jewelled throne that was the seat of the Mughal emperors of India. It was commissioned in the early 17th century by emperor Shah Jahan and was located in the Red Fort of Delhi. The original throne was subsequently captured and taken as a war trophy in 1739 by the Persian ruler Nader Shah, and has been lost ever since. A 2000 report by The Tribune, estimated the value of the Peakcock Throne at $810 million USD (Rs 4.5 billion).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000130/spectrum/main7.htm|title=As priceless as the Peacock Throne|author=K.R.N.

[[Brighton, Ontario]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places on the Great Lakes, Municipalities in Northumberland County, Ontario, Towns in Ontario

Brighton is a town in Northumberland County, Ontario, Canada, approximately [tpl]convert|150|km|mi|0[/tpl] east of Toronto and [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] west of Kingston. It is traversed by both Highway 401 and the former Highway 2.  The west end of the Murray Canal that leads east to the Bay of Quinte is at the east end of the town.
Brighton was primarily an agricultural community, specializing in the farming of apples and production of new apple types. However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as: wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, Brighton is host to Applefest, its largest yearly festival.
The Municipality of Brighton (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of Brighton and Brighton Township) is home to nearly 11,000 inhabitants, with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near lake Ontario tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living. Many small hamlets surround the town, including Codrington, Carman, Hilton, Spring Valley and Smithfield.
Presqu'ile Provincial Park, just south of the town centre, is one of Brighton's most popular attractions. The park is noted for birdwatching and other nature-oriented activities.

[[Amherstview, Ontario]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places on the Great Lakes, Communities in Lennox and Addington County

Amherstview is a community in Loyalist Township, Ontario.
It is located on the north shore of Lake Ontario and has a population of approximately 10,000. It is adjacent to the city of Kingston, and considered part of the greater Kingston area. Amherstview is named for Amherst Island, located directly to the south in Lake Ontario. When the community was first established in the 1950s, the spelling was generally "Amherst View".
The community is the eastern end of the Loyalist Parkway, a stretch of Highway 33 that travels along Lake Ontario, in an area in which many United Empire Loyalists settled.  Amherstview is home to Fairfield House which is itself situated in Fairfield Park on the shore of Lake Ontario.  Fairfield House was constructed in 1793 by the Fairfield family who were among the first Loyalists to settle the area.  It served as the family home and a portion of the building was also used as a tavern for some time.  The impressive limestone building is now a museum exhibiting period artifacts and furniture and offering guided tours.
Public transportation between Amherstview and Kingston is provided by Kingston Transit.
Since Amherstview is part of Loyalist Township, it has no legal boundaries. General boundaries are Lake Ontario to the south, the Canadian National rail line to the north, Coronation Boulevard to the east (the City of Kingston boundary), and Lennox and Addington County Road 6 to the west.
Amherstview is also home to the educational institution Amherstview Public School, and elementary and middle school composed of students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.

In software and systems engineering, a use case is a list of steps, typically defining interactions between a role (known in Unified Modeling Language (UML) as an "actor") and a system, to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or an external system.
In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in Systems Modeling Language (SysML) or as contractual statements.
As an important requirement technique, use cases have been widely used in modern software engineering over the last two decades. Use case driven development is a key characteristic of process models and frameworks like Unified Process (UP), Rational Unified Process (RUP), Oracle Unified Method (OUM), etc. With its iterative and evolutionary nature, use case is also a good fit for agile development.

Giulio de' Medici (between 1533 to 1537 http://www.worldroots.com/cgi-bin/gasteldb?@I25485@ - 1600) was the illegitimate son of Alessandro de' Medici, the Duke of Florence, and probably of Taddea Malaspina.
Aged no more than four at the time of his father's assassination, he was passed over as a choice for the succession in favour of Cosimo I de' Medici, the first of the "junior" branch of the Medici to rule Florence. He was placed under the guardianship of Cosimo I and raised at his court. In 1562 he was appointed the first knight of the Order of Saint Stephen, an order founded to combat pirates and Turks in the Mediterranean Sea. As Admiral of the Order, from 1563 to 1566, he was sent to help the Knights Hospitallers during the Siege of Malta in 1565. He also acted as an ambassador, to Mantua in 1565; to Rome in 1571 and again in 1573.
Giulio was married to Lucrezia Gaetani. They had a daughter, Caterina, who became a Benedictine nun and died in 1634. He also had two illegitimate sons, Cosimo, who followed him as a knight of the Order of Saint Stephen, and Giuliano.

[[Stream bed]]
CATEGORIES: Water streams, Rivers, Fluvial landforms, Limnology, Riparian zone, Freshwater ecology, Geomorphology, Geology

A stream bed is the channel bottom of a stream, river or creek; the physical confine of the normal water flow.  The lateral confines or channel margins, during all but flood stage, are known as the stream banks or river banks. In fact, a flood occurs when a stream overflows its banks and flows onto its flood plain. As a general rule, the bed is that part of the channel, just at the "normal" water line and the banks are that part above the water line. However, because water flow varies, this differentiation is subject to local interpretation. Usually, the bed is kept clear of terrestrial vegetation, whereas the banks are subjected to water flow only during unusual or perhaps infrequent high water stages and therefore, might support vegetation some or much of the time.
The descriptive terms "right bank" and "left bank" are relative to an observer looking downstream, in which the right bank is to the observer's right, and vice versa. A famous example of this is the naming of the two sides of the river Seine in Paris.
The nature of any stream bed is always a function of the flow dynamics and the local geologic materials, influenced by that flow. With small streams in mesophytic regions, the nature of the stream bed is strongly responsive to conditions of precipitation runoff. Where natural conditions of either grassland or forest ameliorate peak flows, stream beds are stable, possibly rich, with organic matter and exhibit minimal scour. These streams support a rich biota. Where conditions produce unnatural levels of runoff, such as occurs below roads, the stream beds will exhibit a greater amount of scour, often down to bedrock and banks may be undercut. This process greatly increases watershed erosion and results in thinner soils, upslope from the stream bed, as the channel adjusts to the increase in flow.
Beds are usually what would be left once a stream is no longer in existence; the beds are usually well preserved even if they get buried, because the walls and canyons made by the stream usually have hard walls, usually soft sand and debris fill the bed. Dry stream beds are also subject to becoming underground water pockets (buried stream beds only) and flooding by heavy rains and water rising from the ground and may sometimes be part of the rejuvenation of the stream.

Charles Pierre Péguy ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʃaʁl peɡi|lang[/tpl]; January 7, 1873 – September 4, 1914) was a noted French poet, essayist, and editor born in Orléans. His two main philosophies were socialism and nationalism, but by 1908 at the latest, after years of uneasy agnosticism, he had become a devout but non-practicing Roman Catholic."Peguy' s Catholicism was closely allied with his love of France. Of him, as also of Psichari, it might almost be said that they were Catholics because they were Frenchmen. A non-Catholic Frenchman seemed a monstrosity, something cut off from the true life of his country. Some Catholicism is international or indifferent to country, with almost the motto, 'What matters country so long as the Church survives?' But that is not the Catholicism of these young Frenchmen, nor the Catholicism of the recent religious revival." —  Rawlinson, Gerald Christopher (1917). "Charles Péguy," in Recent French Tendencies from Renan to Claudel. London: Robert Scott, p. 121."In France the classic type of the fervent but non-practising Catholic was probably best represented by Charles Péguy". — Kuehnelt-Leddihn, Erik von (1952).

Tyrone Williams "Ty" Conn (January 18, 1967 – May 20, 1999) was a Canadian bank robber. He was the only person in the last half century to escape over the wall from the Kingston Penitentiary, one of Canada's most secure prisons. 
Conn was transferred to Kingston Penitentiary for acting as an informant at the Millhaven Institution. He advised security staff at Millhaven that fellow inmates were planning an escape and was therefore placed in protective custody.
Conn's escape on May 6, 1999 from inside the compound was the 26th in the history of facility.  More than 50 escapees were involved in those 26 incidents. Conn employed a ladder and homemade grappling hook to scale the wall and used cayenne pepper to prevent dogs from following his scent. 
Conn had already escaped from several lower-security institutions.  He was found in a Toronto apartment building two weeks later and surrounded by police, only to commit suicide rather than be captured. Other theories assert that Conn accidentally discharged the stolen shotgun in his possession during the standoff while he was speaking on the telephone to Theresa Burke, a CBC producer.

The common minke whale or northern minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is a species of minke whale within the suborder of baleen whales. It is the smallest member of the rorquals and the second smallest species of baleen whale. Although first ignored by whalers due to its small size and low oil yield, it began to be exploited by various countries beginning in the early 20th century. As other species declined larger numbers of common minke whales were caught, largely for their meat. It is now one of the primary targets of the whaling industry. There is a dwarf form in the Southern Hemisphere.

[[Anechoic chamber]]
CATEGORIES: Acoustics, Laboratories, Electromagnetic radiation, Silence, Radiation, Rooms

An anechoic chamber  (an-echoic meaning non-reflective, non-echoing or echo-free) is a room designed to completely absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves. 
They are also insulated from exterior sources of noise. The combination of both aspects means they simulate a quiet open-space of infinite dimension, which is useful when exterior influences would otherwise give false results.
Anechoic chambers, a term coined by American acoustics expert Leo Beranek, were originally used in the context of acoustics (sound waves) to minimize the reflections of a room. More recently, rooms designed to reduce reflection and external noise in radio frequencies have been used to test antennae, radars, or electromagnetic interference. 
Anechoic chambers range from small compartments the size of household microwave ovens to ones as large as aircraft hangars. The size of the chamber depends on the size of the objects to be tested and the frequency range of the signals used, although scale models can sometimes be used by testing at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies).

The Roman Bridge at Chaves, also known as Trajano bridge as a reference to Trajan, is an ancient bridge located in the north of Portugal in the town of the same name. The bridge which is in relatively good shape unites the two most important parishes in the town. The bridge is 140 meters long, high and has 12 visible arches. Although the bridge spanning the Minho in Ourense is longer and higher, this example of Roman architecture is even today a masterpiece of construction. 
Two of the columns of the original bridge, built by the Emperor Trajan, still stand. They are stout cylindrical columns with details of the honors bestowed by the emperor on local governors or generals clearly legible on them. They were also milestones indicating distances to the important settlements of Astorga in Spanish León and Bracara Augusta, Braga, in Portugal.

[[Stem (skiing)]]

CATEGORIES: Skiing techniques

The stem technique in skiing is a method for turning the skier.  It is usually credited to the Austrian Mathias Zdarsky who developed it in the 1890s.  Its variations gradually replaced the telemark technique in Alpine skiing.
The technique involves stemming the uphill ski.  Stemming is pushing the tail of the ski outward—skidding it across snow—from a parallel position with the downhill ski to form a V shape where the tips of the skis are close together and the tails far apart.  Initially the stemming ski has relatively little pressure applied—much less than half the skier's weight.  After the ski is stemmed, most of the skiers weight is then transferred to initiate a change in direction.

[[American Golden Plover]]

The American Golden Plover (Pluvialis dominica) is a medium-sized plover.
Adults are spotted gold and black on the crown, back and wings. Their face and neck are black with a white border; they have a black breast and a dark rump. The legs are black.
It is similar to two other golden plovers, Eurasian and Pacific. The American Golden Plover is smaller, slimmer and relatively longer-legged than European Golden Plover (Pluvialis apricaria) which also has white axillary (armpit) feathers. It is more similar to Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva) with which it was once considered conspecific under the name "Lesser Golden Plover".Reviewed in Sangster et al. (2002). The Pacific Golden Plover is slimmer than the American species, has a shorter primary projection, and longer legs, and is usually yellower on the back.
These birds forage for food on tundra, fields, beaches and tidal flats, usually by sight. They eat insects and crustaceans, also berries.
The breeding habitat of American Golden Plover is Arctic tundra from northern Canada and Alaska. They nest on the ground in a dry open area. They are migratory and winter in southern South America. They follow an elliptical migration path; northbound birds pass through Central America about January–AprilStrewe & Navarro (2004), Herrera et al. (2006) and stage in great numbers in places like Illinois before their final push north. In fall, they take a more easterly route, flying mostly over the western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea to the wintering grounds in Patagonia. The bird has one of the longest known migratory routes of over [tpl]convert|25000|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. Of this, [tpl]convert|2400|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] is over open ocean where it cannot stop to feed or drink. It does this from body fat stores that it stocks up on prior to the flight. It is a regular vagrant to western Europe.
A comparison of dates and migratory patterns leads to the conclusion that Eskimo Curlews and American Golden Plovers were the most likely shore birds to have attracted the attention of Christopher Columbus to nearby America in early October 1492, after 65 days at sea out of sight of land.[tpl]cite web|title=Eskimo Curlew - A vanishing species? : The Eskimo Curlew's Year - Introduction to Oceanic Migration|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/curlew/oceanint.htm|author=J.B.

The snowplough turn (or snowplow turn) (or pizza), also known as a wedge turn, is a ski braking and turning technique taught to beginners. The front tips of the skis are brought together and the tails pushed wide apart, with the knees rolled inwards slightly. By applying pressure against the snow with the inside edges of the skis speed is reduced, making turning in such a configuration and stopping completely possible.
However, it is much less effective on steep runs, and much less efficient than the parallel turn used by advanced skiers.

The year 2038 problem may cause some computer software to fail at some point near the year 2038. The problem affects all software and systems that both store system time as a signed 32-bit integer, and interpret this number as the number of seconds since

Times beyond this moment will "wrap around" and be stored internally as a negative number, which these systems will interpret as a date in December 13, 1901 rather than January 19, 2038. This is caused by integer overflow. The counter "runs out" of usable bits, "increments" the sign bit instead, and reports a maximally negative number (continuing to count up, toward zero). This is likely to cause problems for users of these systems due to erroneous calculations.
Further, while most programs will only be affected in or very close to 2038, programs that work with future dates will begin to run into problems much sooner.  For example, a program that works with dates 23 years in the future will have to be fixed no later than 2015.
Because most 32-bit Unix-like systems store and manipulate time in this format, it is usually called Unix time, and so the year 2038 problem is often referred to as the Unix Millennium Bug.

[[Stem Christie]]
CATEGORIES: Skiing techniques

The stem Christie is a technique in skiing for turning.  It is a refinement of the basic stem technique where, prior to the turn, the uphill ski is stemmed (tail skidded outward) from being parallel with the downhill ski to form a V shape.
The turn was named after Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway, where the name Kristianiasving was used for the parallel turn, differentiating it from the Telemark turn.
The technique was introduced to central Europe in 1910 by the Austrian ski guide Hannes Schneider.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]  Along with the other two stem techniques, it formed the basis of his Arlberg technique and instruction method.
The technique was popular and widely used up until the late 1960s, when its use diminished in favor of the parallel turn, inspired mostly by ski racers.  Radical side-cut skis, developed in the late 1990s, have accelerated the obsolescence of the stem Christie.
It is still occasionally taught to intermediate and advanced skiers to demonstrate the difference in efficient movements with less efficient movements.

[[Parallel turn]]

CATEGORIES: Skiing techniques

The parallel turn in alpine skiing is a method for turning which rolls the ski onto one edge, allowing it to bend into an arc. Thus bent, the ski follows the turn without sliding. It contrasts with earlier techniques such as the stem Christie, which slides the ski outward from the body ("stemming") to generate sideways force. Parallel turns generate much less friction and are more efficient both in maintaining speed and minimizing skier effort.
Parallel turns require solid contact from the skier's lower leg to the ski to rotate it on-edge. This was difficult to achieve with early ski equipment, limiting the technique to the high performance realm of racing. The introduction of composite skis, metal edges, releasable clamping bindings, and stiff plastic boots combined to allow parallel turns even on beginner equipment. By the late 1960s it rapidly replaced stemming for all but very short-radius turns. The evolution of shaped skis in the 1990s advanced the carving turn to preeminence. 
Today parallel turns are taught to teach novice skiers the effect of weighting and unweighting their skis.

[[Alhamdulillah]]
CATEGORIES: Arabic words and phrases, Islamic terms, God

Al-ḥamdu lillāh ([tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]large|الحمد لله[/tpl][/tpl]) is an Arabic phrase meaning "Praise to God". It is commonly used by Arabic speakers of all religions, including Christianity and Judaism, and frequently by Muslims due to the centrality of this specific phrase within the texts of the Qur'an and the words of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It is similar to the Hebrew word Hallelujah הַלְלוּיָהּ ('God be praised').
The meaning and in-depth explanation of Alhamdulillah have been the subject of much exegesis.
The phrase has three basic parts:
Note:
''(1) The word "Allah" is the fusion of the article al (the) and the word ilah (a god, deity).
Very much like in English, "The" article is used here to single out the noun as being the only one of its kind, "The god" (the one and only) or "God" with a capital G (the concept of capital letters does not exist in Arabic).
Therefore, "Allah" is the Arabic word for "God".
(2) "ilāh" is the Arabic cognate of the ancient Semitic name for God, El
It also means that anything in existence to which is ascribed praise, thanks, glorification, or gratitude, is only able to achieve it due to God's infinite mercy and grace.
Alhamdulillah: in theory, it is to be said with a profound sense of love, adoration, and awe of the power, glory, and mercy of God. In practice, however, its use is so widespread in Arabic-speaking countries that it might better be understood as meaning "thankfully," "thank goodness," or "thank God" as used in American English. Which is to say that not all Arabic speakers who use the phrase are consciously praising God when they say it.
It not only praises God in general for the above-mentioned qualities, but also seeks to praise Him specifically for those attributes of God's names in Islam, which God did not necessarily have as omnipotent (such as all-seeing, all-hearing), but rather chose to have out of His mercy (the Loving (Al-Wadud), the Beneficent (Ar-Rahman)) and showering Grace upon His servants.
Some of the 99 Names of God in Islam, referred to by this idea are:
The phrase is first found in the second verse of the first sura of the Qur'an (Al-Fatiha). So frequently do Muslims and Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians invoke this phrase that the quadriliteral verb Hamdala حمدل, "to say al-Hamdu li-'llah" was coined, and the derived noun Hamdalah حمدلة is used as a name for this phrase.
On any occasion and in any situation when Muslims desire to praise God, they may say: Alhamdulillah (الحمد لله).
The triconsonantal root Ḥ-M-D (ح م د), meaning "praise," can also be found in the names Muhammad, Mahmud, Hamid and Ahmad.

[[Tomsrtbt]]

CATEGORIES: Mini Linux distributions, Floppy disk-based operating systems, Lua-scripted software

tomsrtbt (pronounced: Tom's Root Boot) is a very small Linux distribution. It is short for "Tom's floppy which has a root filesystem and is also bootable." Its author, Tom Oehser, touts it as "The most GNU/Linux on one floppy disk", containing many common Linux command-line tools useful for system recovery (Linux and other operating systems.) It also features drivers for many types of hardware, and network connectivity.
It could be created from within Linux or earlier versions of Windows running in MS-DOS mode, either by formatting a standard 1.44MB floppy disk as a higher density 1.722MB disk and writing the tomsrtbt image to the disk, or by burning it as a bootable CD. It is capable of reading and writing the filesystems of many operating systems of its era, including ext2/ext3 (used in Linux), FAT (used by DOS and Windows), NTFS (used in Windows NT, 2000, and XP) and Minix (used by the Minix operating system).
Windows NT and most later versions of Windows, including 2000, XP, and Vista, cannot create a tomsrtbt floppy as their floppy driver does not allow the extended format.
A few of the utilities on tomsrtbt are written in the Lua programming language, and many more use BusyBox.  Space saving compiler options were used throughout, the kernel was patched to support loading an image compressed with Bzip2, and in many cases older or alternate versions of programs were selected due to their smaller size.
As of 2012 the tomsrtbt home page, though still faithful, has not been updated for years and is largely of historic interest. It comprises mostly broken links. tomsrtbt persists in mirror sites and is still useful for computers of its era.

Sagas are stories about ancient Scandinavian and Germanic history, about early Viking voyages, the battles that took place during the voyages, about migration to Iceland and of feuds between Icelandic families. They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland. "Saga" is a word originating from Old Norse or Icelandic language ("Saga" is also the modern Icelandic word for "story"). Saga is a cognate of the English word say: its various meanings in Icelandic are approximately equivalent to "something said" or "a narrative in prose", somewhat along the lines of a "story", a "tale", or a "history".Kellogg, xx
The texts are tales in prose which share some similarities with the epic, often with stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text, of heroic deeds of days long gone, "tales of worthy men," who were often Vikings, sometimes pagan, sometimes Christian. The tales are usually realistic, except legendary sagas, sagas of saints, sagas of bishops and translated or recomposed romances. They are sometimes romanticised and fantastic, but always dealing with human beings one can understand.

Exley was also a pioneer of extreme deep scuba diving.  
For purposes of rescue during cave diving, Exley helped standardize the usage of the "octopus," a redundant second stage diving regulator that can be used as a backup in the event that the diver's primary second stage fails, or alternatively to allow the diver and his buddy to have simultaneous access to his gas if the buddy has an out-of-gas emergency. The octopus is now considered an essential piece of equipment among virtually all scuba divers, whether caving or in open water.
To finance this passion, Exley worked as a mathematics teacher at Suwannee High School in Live Oak, Florida.[tpl]cite book|last=Burgess|first=Robert F.|title=The Cave Divers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LbwrLGZDMHMC&pg=PA317|chapter=The Cave Tiger|pages=317-333[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Menduno|first=Michael|title=Exley On Mix|url=http://web.mac.com/cobber/Trimix/AQUAcorps/mix/ExleyOnMix.htm|accessdate=2012-04-22[/tpl]

[[Pseudoarchaeology]]
CATEGORIES: Pseudoscience, Pseudoarchaeology, Fringe theory

Pseudoarchaeology — also known as alternative archaeology, fringe archaeology, fantastic archaeology, or cult archaeology — refers to interpretations of the past from outside of the academic archaeological community, which typically also reject the accepted scientific and analytical methods of the discipline.Holtorf 2005. p. 544.Fagan and Feder 2006. p. 720.Williams 1987. These pseudoscientific interpretations involve the use of archaeological data to construct theories about the past that differ radically from those of mainstream academic archaeology in order to supplement new historic claims with evidence. Claims like these exaggerate evidence, draw dramatic, romanticized conclusions, and more.Pseudoarchaeology - Atlantis to Aliens.
There is no one singular pseudoarchaeological theory, but many different interpretations of the past that are at odds from those developed by academics. Some of these revolve around the idea that prehistoric and ancient human societies were aided in their development by intelligent extraterrestrial life, an idea propagated by those such as Swiss author Erich von Däniken in books such as Chariots of the Gods? (1968) and Italian author Peter Kolosimo. Others instead hold that there were human societies in the ancient period that were significantly technologically advanced, such as Atlantis, and this idea has been propagated by figures like Graham Hancock in his Fingerprints of the Gods (1995).
Many alternative archaeologies have been adopted by religious groups. Fringe archaeological ideas such as archaeocryptography and pyramidology have been embraced by religions ranging from the British Israelites to the theosophists. Other alternative archaeologies include those that have been adopted by members of New Age and contemporary pagan belief systems. These include the Great Goddess hypothesis, propagated by Marija Gimbutas, according to which prehistoric Europeans worshipped a single female monotheistic deity—and various theories associated with the Earth mysteries movement, such as the concept of ley lines.
Academic archaeologists have heavily criticised pseudoarchaeology, with one of the most vocal critics, John R. Cole, characterising it as relying on "sensationalism, misuse of logic and evidence, misunderstanding of scientific method, and internal contradictions in their arguments."Cole 1980. p. 02. The relationship between alternative and academic archaeologies has been compared to the relationship between intelligent design theories and evolutionary biology by some archaeologists.Fagan and Feder 2006. p. 721.

[[Opium of the people]]
CATEGORIES: Criticism of religion, Marxism, Political slogans, Quotations

"Religion is the opium of the people" is one of the most frequently paraphrased statements of German economist Karl Marx. It was translated from the German original, "Die Religion ... ist das Opium des Volkes" and is often referred to as "the religion... is the opiate of the masses." The quotation originates from the introduction of his proposed work A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right; this work was never written, but the introduction (written in 1843) was published in 1844 in Marx's own journal Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher, a collaboration with Arnold Ruge. The phrase "This opium you feed your people" appeared in 1797 in Marquis de Sade's text L'Histoire de Juliette and Novalis's "Religion acts merely as an opiate" around the same time. The full quote from Karl Marx is: "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people".

Paoluccio or Paolo Lucio Anafesto (Latin Anafestus Paulucius or Paulicius) was the reputed first doge of Venice. A noble of Eraclea, then the primary city of the region, he was elected in 697 as an official over the entire lagoon that surrounded Venice, both to put an end to the conflicts between the various tribunes who until then had governed the various parts, and to coordinate the defense against the Lombards and the Slavs who were encroaching on the settlements. However, his existence is uncorroborated by any source before the 11th century though he was probably not entirely legendary.
According to John Julius Norwich, Paolo Lucio Anafesto was actually Exarch Paul.  Moreover, Paul's magister militum had the same first name as Paoluccio's reputed successor, Marcellus Tegallianus, casting doubt on the authenticity of that doge as well.Norwich, p.13

Between 1992 and 1998, the GIA conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation (see List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s; notably the Bentalha massacre and Rais massacre, among others.) Since announcing its campaign against foreigners living in Algeria in 1993, the GIA has killed more than 100 expatriate men and women in the country. The group uses assassinations and bombings, including car bombs, and it is known to favor kidnapping victims. The GIA is considered a terrorist organisation by the governments of Algeria and France.  Outside Algeria, the GIA established a presence in France, Belgium, Britain, Italy and the United States.

The Napier Deltic engine is a British opposed-piston valveless, two-stroke Diesel engine used in marine and locomotive applications, designed and produced by Napier & Son. The cylinders were divided in three blocks in a triangular arrangement, the blocks forming sides with crankshafts located in each apex of the triangle.
The term Deltic (meaning in the form of the Greek letter Delta) is used to refer to both the Deltic E.130 opposed-piston high-speed Diesel engine and the locomotives produced by English Electric using these engines, including its demonstrator locomotive named DELTIC and the production version for British Railways, which designated these as (TOPS) Class 55.
A single half-sized, turbocharged Deltic power unit also featured in the English Electric-built Type 2 locomotive, designated as the Class 23. Both locomotive and engine became better known as the "Baby Deltic".

[[Thesis]]

CATEGORIES: Academia, Rhetoric, Scientific documents, Educational assessment and evaluation, Theses

A thesis or dissertationOriginally, the word compounds "dissertation" and "thesis" (plural, "theses") were not interchangeable. When, at ancient universities, the lector had completed his lecture, there would traditionally follow a disputation, during which students could take up certain points and argue them. The position that one took during a disputation was the thesis, while the dissertation was the line of reasoning with which one buttressed it. Olga Weijers: The medieval disputatio. In: Hora est! (On dissertations), p.23-27. Leiden University Library, 2005 is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings.International Standard ISO 7144: Documentation—Presentation of theses and similar documents, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, 1986. In some contexts, the word "thesis" or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, while "dissertation" is normally applied to a doctorate, while in others, the reverse is true.Douwe Breimer, Jos Damen et al.: Hora est! (On dissertations). Leiden University Library, 2005 Dissertations and theses may be considered as grey literature.
The required complexity and/or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university and/or program, therefore, the required minimum study period may vary highly significant in duration.
The word dissertation can at times be used to describe a treatise without relation to obtaining an academic degree. The term thesis is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.

Not all lumps on the testicles are tumors, and not all tumors are malignant (cancerous). There are many other conditions, such as testicular microlithiasis, epididymal cysts, and appendix testis (hydatid of Morgagni), which may be painful but are non-cancerous.

[[Moriori people]]
CATEGORIES: Moriori, New Zealand society, New Zealand pacifists, Ethnic groups in New Zealand

Moriori are the indigenous people of the Chatham Islands (Rēkohu in Moriori, Wharekauri in Māori), east of the New Zealand archipelago in the Pacific Ocean.  These people lived by a code of non-violence and passive resistance (see Nunuku-whenua), which made it easier for Taranaki Māori invaders to nearly exterminate them in the 1830s.
During the early 20th century it was commonly, but erroneously, believed that the Moriori were pre-Māori settlers of New Zealand, linguistically and genetically different from the Māori, and possibly Melanesian. This story, incorporated into Stephenson Percy Smith's "Great Fleet" hypothesis, was widely believed during the early 20th century. However the hypothesis was not always accepted., see 1904 paper by A. Shand on The Early History of the Morioris
By the late 20th century the hypothesis that the Moriori were different from the Māori had fallen out of favour amongst archeologists, who believed that the Moriori were Māori who settled on the Chatham Islands in the 16th century. The earlier hypothesis was discredited in the 1960s and 1970s.As Kerry Howe put it, 'Scholarship over the past 40 years has radically revised the model offered a century earlier by Smith: the Moriori as a pre-Polynesian people have gone (the term Moriori is now a technical term referring to those ancestral Māori who settled the Chatham Islands)' (Howe 2003:182).

United States lawful permanent residency is the immigration status of a person authorized to live and work in the United States of America permanently.
A United States Permanent Resident Card (USCIS Form I-551), formerly Alien Registration Card or Alien Registration Receipt Card (INS Form I-151), is an identification card attesting to the permanent resident status of an alien in the United States. It is known informally as a green card because it had been green from 1946 until 1964, and it has reverted to that color since May 11, 2010.[tpl]cite web | url=http://blog.uscis.gov/2010/05/new-design-green-card-goes-green.html | title=New Design: The Green Card Goes Green | date=2010-05-11 | publisher=USCIS official blog[/tpl]USCIS To Issue Redesigned Green Card American Immigration Lawyers Association Website, retrieved April 23, 2014 Green card also refers to an immigration process of becoming a permanent resident. The green card serves as proof that its holder, a lawful permanent resident (LPR), has been officially granted immigration benefits, which include permission to reside and take employment in the United States. The holder must maintain permanent resident status, and can be removed from the United States if certain conditions of this status are not met.
Green cards were formerly issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2135) dismantled INS and separated the former agency into three components within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The first, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) handles applications for immigration benefits. Two other agencies were created to oversee the INS' former functions of immigration enforcement: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=e00c0b89284a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&vgnextchannel=e00c0b89284a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD |title=USCIS - Our History |publisher=Uscis.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30[/tpl]
Permanent residents of the United States eighteen years of age or older must carry their valid physical green card itself at all times. Failing to do so is a violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, carrying the possibility of a fine up to $100 and/or imprisonment for up to 30 days for each offense.INA §264(e), 8 U.S.C. § 1304(e) Only the federal government can impose these penalties.[ref]8 U.S.C. § 1304 : US Code - Section 1304: Forms for registration and fingerprinting

Among the most famous are the claims that the Papal Tiara bears the number of the beast inscriptions, that a woman was once elected pope, or that the current pope will be the last Pope. The two former claims have been independently determined to be false.  The latter claim has been shown to be false for every known pope barring the incumbent; but it remains theoretically possible.

First released in North America, Europe, and Australia on June 23, 1991, the game is the first installment in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, chronicling the adventures of the titular character in his quest to defeat the series' antagonist Dr. Robotnik. The game's story focuses on Sonic's efforts to stop Dr. Robotnik's plans for world domination, release the animals Dr. Robotnik has trapped, and collect six magical emeralds known as the Chaos Emeralds.
Development of Sonic the Hedgehog began in 1990, when Sega ordered its AM8 development team to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company. After a hedgehog was decided on as the main character, the development group was renamed Sonic Team.
Sonic the Hedgehog received positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's visuals and its sense of speed. It was commercially successful, increasing the popularity of the Mega Drive/Genesis and establishing Sonic the Hedgehog as the company's mascot. Its success led to the development of subsequent games in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, as well as the creation of a media franchise of spin-off products featuring the character.

The region is a repository for natural gas, and consists of the Chunxiao, Tianwaitian, Canxue, Duanqiao, and Pinghue fields. The entire trough is approximately 500 kilometres long, and runs parallel to the Chinese coast.
On August 19, 2003 it was announced that Sinopec, CNOOC, Royal Dutch/Shell and Unocal had entered into a joint venture to exploit the gas reserves in the trough, beginning in mid-2005. Gas production was expected to reach 2.5 km³ a year by 2007. However, on September 29, 2004, the two foreign partners in the joint venture, Royal Dutch/Shell and Unocal Corporation, announced their withdrawal citing doubts over the commercial viability of the resources in the area and the territorial dispute.

The Ilocos Region, containing four provinces, is named after Ilocos. 28% of the inhabitants of the region are Pangasinan people, who belong to a different ethnolinguistic group from the Ilocanos.
In the 330 pages “The Ilocos Heritage” (the 27th book written by Visitacion de la Torre), the Ilocano legacy and the life of the Ilocano – are described as - "the browbeaten, industrious, cheerful, simple soul who has shown a remarkable strain of bravery and a bit of wanderlust." The Ilocano history reveals his struggles and victories – in battles for colonial independence from Spain and America, to Philippine leadership. The new Ilocano searched for greener pastures towards new lands local and foreign - Palawan, Mindanao, Hawaii, the United States and Greece. The Ilocano material culture and spirituality can be seen in the past - images of Spanish santo (saints), antique but intricate wooden furniture and quality local fiber. The native Ilocano is a weaver, wood carver and pottery expert. The Ilocano cuisine – ranges from the exotic "abu-os" (ant eggs) to vegetable broth "dinengdeng," the sticky "tinubong" to the "poqui-poqui" (eggplant salad). Ilocandia is filled with colonial churches, the legacy of Spanish Catholicism.newsinfo.inquirer.net, The rich treasures of Ilocandia

Their descendants remained unconverted to Islam, but did however adopt elements of Arabic language and culture. They were mostly Roman Catholics of the Visigothic or Mozarabic Rite.
Most of the Mozarabs were descendants of Hispano–Gothic Christians and were primarily speakers of the Mozarabic language (late Latin of Iberia) under Islamic rule. Many were also what the arabist Mikel de Epalza calls "Neo-Mozarabs", that is Northern Europeans who had come to the Iberian Peninsula and picked up Arabic, thereby entering the Mozarabic community.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
A few were Arab and Berber Christians coupled with Muslim converts to Christianity who, as Arabic speakers, naturally were at home among the original Mozarabs. A prominent example of Muslims who became Mozarabs by embracing Christianity is the Andalusian rebel and Anti-Umayyad military leader, Umar ibn Hafsun. The Mozarabs of Muslim origin were descendants of those Muslims who converted to Christianity, following the conquest of Toledo and perhaps also, following the expeditions of king Alfonso I of Aragon. These Mozarabs of Muslim origin, who converted en masse at the end of the 11th century, many of them Muladi (ethnic Iberians previously converted to Islam), are totally distinct from the Mudéjars and Moriscos who converted gradually to Christianity between the 12th and 17th centuries.
Separate Mozarab enclaves were located in the large Muslim cities, especially Toledo, Córdoba, Zaragoza, and Seville.

Chloromethane, also called methyl chloride, R-40 or HCC 40, is a chemical compound of the group of organic compounds called haloalkanes. It was once widely used as a refrigerant.  It is a colorless extremely flammable gas with a mildly sweet odor, which is, however, detected at possibly toxic levels.  Due to concerns about its toxicity, it is no longer present in consumer products.
Chloromethane was first synthesized by the French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot in 1835 by boiling a mixture of methanol, sulfuric acid, and sodium chloride.  This method is similar to that used today.

Tōshūsai Sharaku ([tpl]lang-ja|東洲斎 写楽[/tpl]; active 1794–1795) was a Japanese ukiyo-e print artist, known for his portraits of kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers.  Little is known of him besides the prints he designed; neither his true name nor the dates of his birth or death are known.  His active career as a woodblock artist spanned ten months; his prolific work met disapproval, and his output came to an end as suddenly and mysteriously as it had begun.  His work has since been recognized as some of the greatest in the ukiyo-e genre.
Primarily portraits of kabuki actors, Sharaku's compositions emphasize poses of dynamism and energy, and display a realism unusual for prints of the time—conptemporaries such as Utamaro represented their subjects with an idealized beauty, while Sharaku did not shy from showing unflattering details.  This was not to the tastes of the public, and the enigmatic artist's production ceased in the first month of 1795.  His mastery of the medium with no apparent apprenticeship has drawn much speculation, and researchers have long attempted to discover his true identity—some suggesting he was an obscure poet, others a Noh actor, or even the ukiyo-e master Hokusai.

Tsukioka Yoshitoshi ([tpl]lang-ja|月岡 芳年[/tpl]; also named Taiso Yoshitoshi [tpl]lang|ja|大蘇 芳年[/tpl]; 30 April 1839 – 9 June 1892) was a Japanese artist.Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric. (2005). "Tsukoka Kōgyō" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 1000.
He is widely recognized as the last great master of the ukiyo-e genre of woodblock printing and painting. He is also regarded as one of the form's greatest innovators. His career spanned two eras – the last years of Edo period Japan, and the first years of modern Japan following the Meiji Restoration. Like many Japanese, Yoshitoshi was interested in new things from the rest of the world, but over time he became increasingly concerned with the loss of many aspects of traditional Japanese culture, among them traditional woodblock printing.
By the end of his career, Yoshitoshi was in an almost single-handed struggle against time and technology. As he worked on in the old manner, Japan was adopting Western mass reproduction methods like photography and lithography. Nonetheless, in a Japan that was turning away from its own past, he almost singlehandedly managed to push the traditional Japanese woodblock print to a new level, before it effectively died with him.
His life is perhaps best summed up by John Stevenson:
His reputation has only continued to grow, both in the West, and among younger Japanese, and he is now almost universally recognized as the greatest Japanese artist of his era.

[[Smooth muscle tissue]]

CATEGORIES: Muscular system, Muscle tissue

Smooth muscle is an involuntary non-striated muscle. It is divided into two sub-groups; the single-unit (unitary) and multiunit smooth muscle. Within single-unit smooth muscle tissues, the autonomic nervous system innervates a single cell within a sheet or bundle and the action potential is propagated by gap junctions to neighboring cells such that the whole bundle or sheet contracts as a syncytium (i.e., a multinucleate mass of cytoplasm that is not separated into cells). Multiunit smooth muscle tissues innervate individual cells; as such, they allow for fine control and gradual responses, much like motor unit recruitment in skeletal muscle.
Smooth muscle is found within the walls of blood vessels (such smooth muscle specifically being termed vascular smooth muscle) such as in the tunica media layer of large (aorta) and small arteries, arterioles and veins. Smooth muscle is also found in lymphatic vessels, the urinary bladder, uterus (termed uterine smooth muscle), male and female reproductive tracts, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, erector pili of skin, the ciliary muscle, and iris of the eye. The structure and function is basically the same in smooth muscle cells in different organs, but the inducing stimuli differ substantially, in order to perform individual effects in the body at individual times. In addition, the glomeruli of the kidneys contain smooth muscle-like cells called mesangial cells.

Together they had eight children: Phillip, Richard, Christopher, Betsey, Margaret, Susan, Mary and Christine. His wife died on September 10, 1863 at the age of one hundred and five years.
Records have shown that in 1825 the Bakemans settled in Arcade, New York, in a home on the north side of the County Line Road. In 1845 he moved to Freedom, remaining there until his death.

Haptic technology, or haptics, is a tactile feedback technology which takes advantage of the sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user.[tpl]cite web|author=Gabriel Robles-De-La-Torre |url=http://www.isfh.org/ch.html |title=International Society for Haptics: Haptic technology, an animated explanation |publisher=Isfh.org |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] This mechanical stimulation can be used to assist in the creation of virtual objects in a computer simulation, to control such virtual objects, and to enhance the remote control of machines and devices (telerobotics). It has been described as "doing for the sense of touch what computer graphics does for vision".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.isfh.org/GR-Virtual_Reality_TouchHaptics2009.pdf |title=Robles-De-La-Torre G. Virtual Reality: Touch / Haptics. In Goldstein B (Ed.), "Sage Encyclopedia of Perception". Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks CA (2009). |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] Haptic devices may incorporate tactile sensors that measure forces exerted by the user on the interface.
Haptic technology has made it possible to investigate how the human sense of touch works by allowing the creation of carefully controlled haptic virtual objects. These objects are used to systematically probe human haptic capabilities, which would otherwise be difficult to achieve. These research tools contribute to the understanding of how touch and its underlying brain functions work.
The word haptic, from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἅπτικός[/tpl] (haptikos), means pertaining to the sense of touch and comes from the Greek verb [tpl]lang|grc|ἅπτεσθαι[/tpl] haptesthai, meaning to contact or to touch.

Die Tageszeitung (English: “The daily newspaper”, often displayed as die tageszeitung and commonly referred to as taz), was founded in 1978 in Berlin. It is a cooperative-owned German daily newspaper which is administrated by a workers' self-management. Rising out of the midst of a progressive and politically left-leaning movement in the '70s, its main focus has been on current politics and societal issues such as inequality and ecological crises both at the local and global scale and not covered by the more traditional and conservative newspapers at the time. It has often supported the German Green Party, but the taz has also been critical of the SPD/Greens coalition government (1998–2005).

A mesophile is an organism that grows best in moderate temperature, neither too hot nor too cold, typically between 20 and 45 °C (68 and 113 °F).Willey, Joanne M., Linda Sherwood, Christopher J. Woolverton, and Lansing M. Prescott. Prescott, Harley, and Klein's Microbiology. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print. The term is mainly applied to microorganisms.
The habitats of these organisms include especially cheese, yogurt, and mesophile organisms are often included in the process of beer and wine making.
Organisms that prefer cold environments are termed  psychrophilic, those preferring warmer temperatures are termed thermophilic and those thriving in extremely hot environments are hyperthermophilic.
All bacteria have their own optimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive the most. 
A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to classify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic.

[[Housing estate]]
CATEGORIES: Human habitats, Real estate, Housing estates

A housing estate is a group of homes and other buildings built together as a single development. The exact form may vary from country to country. Accordingly, a housing estate is usually built by a single contractor, with only a few styles of house or building design, so they tend to be uniform in appearance. Generally housing estates are monotenure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
In Asian cities such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul, an estate may range from detached houses to high density tower blocks with or without commercial facilities; in Europe and America, these may take the form of town housing, or the older-style rows of terraced houses associated with the industrial revolution,  detached or semi-detached houses with small plots of land around them forming gardens, and are frequently without commercial facilities.
Housing estates are the usual form of residential design used in new towns, where estates are designed as an autonomous suburb,  centred on a small commercial centre. Such estates are usually designed to minimise through-traffic flows, and to provide recreational space in the form of parks and greens.

[[Dirk Struan]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters introduced in 1966, Asian Saga characters, Fictional businesspeople, Fictional Scottish people, Characters in British novels

Dirk Lochlin Struan is the fictional main character of James Clavell's 1966 novel Tai-Pan. The title comes from a Cantonese term that Clavell loosely translates as "supreme leader", and Struan is the taipan or head of his own trading company in China, Struan's. In Clavell's literary universe, moreover, Struan is presented as the Tai-Pan, and his company as the Noble House, the greatest private trading company in nineteenth-century Asia. A Scotsman, "the devil Struan" is portrayed as a tough and resourceful rogue, endowed with vision and determination. A man of extremity, he is capable of tremendous love and terrible hate. He will stop at nothing to protect his home, his family, and the Noble House.
In the back-story as revealed in the novel, Struan begins his nautical adventures as a powder monkey on a King's ship at the battle of Trafalgar, and he remains bound to the sea for life. At the age of fourteen he finds service on an East India Company merchant ship to China, under the command of his future nemesis Tyler Brock. He suffers ruthless punishment from Brock and makes a holy oath to someday destroy him. On a fateful night the ship runs aground on a reef and sinks. Struan swims ashore and finds his way back to the local Portuguese trading settlement of Macao.
Thereafter Struan works only for himself; he starts by practising piracy on Chinese junks and uses them to make dangerous opium runs up the China coast. He expands his smuggling business and eventually masses a fleet of clipper ships and a large fortune. But Tyler Brock also survives the shipwreck to found his own company, Brock and Sons. The two rivals rise to dominate the China trade. But Struan is almost always a little stronger, a little smarter, and a little richer than his nemesis.
The enmity between Struan and Brock is a prominent theme in Clavell's Asian Saga. Struan dies in a typhoon before he can fulfil his oath to destroy Brock. Both men leave many children, legitimate and illegitimate, who take up their fathers' mantles and continue the battle. Thus begins a vicious cycle which lasts many years. It is passed down through the generations. The last descendant of Tyler Brock, Quillan Gornt, dies in a boating accident over 120 years later. After this accident there is no one from the Brock line left to threaten the Noble House.
Struan has a Chinese mistress, May-may, and their romance is developed within the conventions of the genre as the basis for the novel's optimistic theme of cross-cultural fusion.Gina Macdonald, James Clavell: A Critical Companion (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood, 1996), pp. 64-69. The character also has several children who feature in the story, including Culum Struan, Winifred Dunross and Gordon Chen.
Clavell's hero was inspired by the historical William Jardine,John Makinson, "Books: Jardine story – The Thistle and the Jade: A Celebration of Jardine, Matheson & Co. edited by Maggie Keswick", Financial Times (16 October 1982), p. 12."Book (1966): Tai-Pan, James Clavell", South China Morning Post (29 March 2009), p. 7. and the Noble House of Struan's is modelled on the real-life "Princely House" of Jardine, Matheson & Co of Hong Kong.Robyn Meredith, "Sailing From Old to New Asia; Jardine Matheson is ever more a play on its traditional region", Forbes Asia, Volume 4, Issue 15 (15 September 2008), p. 88.

[[Art name]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese culture, Japanese artists

A pseudonym or pen name, also known by its native names hao (in China) and gō (in Japan) and ho (in Korea), is a professional name used by East Asian artists. The word and the concept originated in China, then became popular in other East Asian countries (especially Japan and Korea).
In some cases, artists adopted different pseudonyms at different stages of their career, usually to mark significant changes in their life. Extreme practitioners of this tendency were Tang Yin of the Ming Dynasty, who had more than ten hao and Hokusai of Japan, who in the period 1798 to 1806 alone used no fewer than six.

Sandra Zaiter (born 21 November 1943) is an actress, television children's show host, singer, composer and former athlete in Puerto Rico.
Zaiter was born in the Dominican Republic, of Lebanese Maronite Christian ancestry. Early in her life she participated in church groups, and established her residence in Puerto Rico. Zaiter participated in the Puerto Rican production of Arriba la Gente. She soon started her television career formally by hosting the Puerto Rican version of Romper Room on WRIK-TV channel 7, then called Rikavisión.
Zaiter was also a professional diver and swimmer, until she suffered a life threatening accident in the 1970s, when she hit her head against a rock during a dive at a beach in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. The accident left her paralyzed and since then she has used a wheelchair. In 1976, she won the local OTI Festival as a composer.
Despite her life–changing accident, she continued hosting her children's shows with more energy than ever. During the late 1970s, Zaiter's fame grew as she started recording many well–known children's albums as a singer and hosted a daily television show on WRIK Rikalandia/WLUZ. It ran until channel 7 closed its doors temporarily.
Zaiter later moved on to WKAQ-TV, Telemundo, where she starred, produced, wrote, and hosted, alongside Lou Briel and Dagmar, a children's show called Teatrimundo, and later Telecómicas. She is the spokesperson for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) in Puerto Rico, and an important sponsor of the association's telethon. She is acknowledged by most Puerto Ricans as a hero.
In the 1990s Puerto Rican actress and producer Angela Meyer wrote and produced a drama mini–series titled Gaviota de la Esperanza (The Hope Seagull), based on Zaiter's life. It was broadcast by Telemundo.
Zaiter hosts a weekly show called Contra Viento y Marea (Against Wind and Tide), broadcast by WIPR-TV. Its purpose is to give guidance and assistance to the handicapped. Zaiter does public appearances, especially for the yearly presentation of the Sandra Zaiter Award to those who have distinguished themselves helping the handicapped.
As a surprise to Zaiter, one of Telemundo's studios in Puerto Rico was named after her at the launch of the mid-day show Día a Día con Raymond y Dagmar in 2007. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

Founder Toyoharu adopted Western-style deep perspective, an innovation in Japanese art. His immediate followers, Utagawa Toyohiro and Utagawa Toyokuni adopted bolder, more sensuous styles than Toyoharu and specialized in different genres — Toyohiro in landscapes and Toyokuni in kabuki actor prints. Later artists in the school specialized in other genres, such as warrior prints and mythic parodies.Johnson, Ken, "Fleeting Pleasures of Life In Vibrant Woodcut Prints", art review in The New York Times, March 22, 2008.

The League allied with the Grey League and the League of the Ten Jurisdictions in 1471 to form the Three Leagues. The League of God's House, together with the two other Leagues, was allied with the Old Swiss Confederacy throughout the 15th and 16th centuries.

Aelia Pulcheria (January 19, 398 or 399 – 453)  was the second child of Eastern Roman Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. Her older sister was Flaccilla, born in 397 but assumed to have died young. Her younger siblings were Arcadia, born in 400, Theodosius II, the future emperor, and Marina, both born in 401.Jones, A.H.M, J.R. Martindale, and J. Morris. The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971. When her father died in 408, Theodosius II was made Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, at seven years old. On July 4, 414 a fifteen-year-old Pulcheria proclaimed herself regent over him, then thirteen years of age, and made herself Augusta and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. According to the historian Sozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, Pulcheria took a vow of virginity when she became Augusta, and her sisters followed suit. Theodosius II died on July 26, 450, and Pulcheria soon married Marcian on November 25, 450. Marcian and Pulcheria were proclaimed Emperor and Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Three years later, in July 453, Pulcheria died and was later made a saint by the Church.Women in World History: A biographical encyclopedia. Edited by Anne Commire and Deborah Klezmer. Waterford, Connecticut: Yorkin Publications. 1999-2002. Pulcheria is known to have held a significant amount of power in her brother's reign as emperor. Pulcheria was also of great influence over the church and theological practices of this time, including over anti-pagan policies, church building projects, and the debate over the Marian title Theotokos ("Birth-giver to God").

Zhang Binglin (December 25, 1868 – June 14, 1936), also known as Zhang Taiyan, was a Chinese philologist, textual critic, philosopher, and revolutionary. 
His philological works include Wen Shi (文始 "The Origin of Writing"), the first systematic work of Chinese etymology. He also made contributions to historical Chinese phonology, proposing that "the niang (娘) and ri (日) initials Middle Chinese come from the ni (泥) initial Old Chinese" (known as niang ri gui ni 娘日歸泥). He developed a system of shorthands based on the seal script, called jiyin zimu (記音字母), later adopted as the basis of zhuyin. Though innovative in many ways, he was skeptical of new archaeological findings, regarding the oracle bones as forgery.
An activist as well as a scholar, he produced many political works. Because of his outspoken character, he was jailed for three years by the Qing Empire and put under house arrest for another three by Yuan Shikai.

[[Marooning]]
CATEGORIES: Execution methods, Piracy, Mutinies

Marooning used to be the intentional leaving of someone in a remote area such as an uninhabited island. The word first appears in writing in approximately 1709,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maroon | title=Maroon | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=12 March 2014[/tpl] and is derived from the term maroon, a word for a fugitive slave, which could be a corruption of Spanish cimarrón, meaning a household animal (or slave) who has run "wild".
In earlier centuries it was a penalty for crewmen or for captains at the hands of a crew in cases of mutiny. Then, marooning meant setting a man on a deserted island, often no more than a sand bar at low tide.[tpl]Cite book|author=Kraske, Robert|date=2005|title=Marooned: The Strange But True Adventures of Alexander Selkirk|publisher= Clarion Books|isbn=0-618-56843-3[/tpl] He would be given some food, a container of water, and a loaded pistol so he could commit suicide if he desired.[tpl]Cite book|author=Hickox, Rex|title=All you wanted to know about 18th century Royal Navy|pages= 121 |publisher=Lulu.com|date=2007|isbn=978-1-4116-3057-4[/tpl] The outcome of marooning was usually fatal, but William Greenaway and some men loyal to him survived being marooned, as did pirate captain Edward England.
The chief practitioners of marooning were 17th and 18th century pirates, to such a degree that they were frequently referred to as "marooners." The pirate articles of captains Bartholomew Roberts and John Phillips specify marooning as a punishment for cheating one's fellow pirates or other offenses. In this context, to be marooned is euphemistically to be "made governor of an island".
During the late 18th century in the American South, "marooning" took on a humorous additional meaning describing an extended camping-out picnic over a period of several days (Oxford English Dictionary).
As a result of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714, Sombrero island passed into the hands of the British. Captain Warwick Lake of Recruit marooned an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807. As it turned out, Jeffrey survived. A passing American vessel, the schooner Adams from Marblehead, Massachusetts, had rescued him. Still, a court-martial dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.

The Pimería Alta (upper land of the Pimas), an area of the 18th century Sonora y Sinaloa Province in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, encompassed parts of what are today southern Arizona in the United States and northern Sonora in Mexico.
The area took its name from the Pima and closely related O'odham (Papago) indigenous peoples residing in the Sonoran Desert. Pimería Alta was the site of the Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert established by the Jesuit missionary Eusebio Kino in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. A significant Pima rebellion against Spanish rule occurred in 1751.

[[Scaramouche]]

CATEGORIES: Stock characters, Clever Zanni class characters

Scaramuccia, also known as Scaramouche or Scaramouch, is a roguish clown character of the Italian commedia dell'arte who wears a black mask and, sometimes, glasses. He entertains the audience by his "grimaces and affected language". Salvator Rosa says that Coviello (like Scaramouche) is "sly, adroit, supple, and conceited". In Molière's The Bourgeois Gentleman, Coviello disguises his master as a Turk and pretends to speak Turkish. Both Scaramouche and Coviello can be clever or stupid—as the actor sees fit to portray him.
The name was that of a stock character in 17th-century Italian farce, Scaramuccia (literally "skirmish"), who, attired usually in a black Spanish dress, burlesquing a don, was beaten by Harlequin for his boasting and cowardice.
Scaramouche is one of the iconic characters in the Punch and Judy puppet shows (a performative art with roots in commedia dell'arte). In some scenarios, he is the owner of The Dog, another stock character. During performances, Punch frequently strikes Scaramouche, causing his head to come off his shoulders. Because of this, the term scaramouche has become associated with a class of puppets with extendable necks.

[[Pacific Golden Plover]]
CATEGORIES: Pluvialis, Birds of South Australia, Birds of Tasmania, Birds of Western Australia, Birds of Hawaii, Birds of Ukraine

The Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva) is a medium-sized plover.
The 23–26 cm long breeding adult is  spotted gold and black on the crown, back and wings. Its face and neck are black with a white border and it has a black breast and a dark rump. The legs are black. In winter, the black is lost and the plover then has a yellowish face and breast, and white underparts.
It is similar to two other golden plovers, Eurasian and American. Pacific Golden Plover is smaller, slimmer and relatively longer-legged than European Golden Plover, Pluvialis apricaria, which also has white axillary (armpit) feathers. It is more similar to American Golden Plover, Pluvialis dominica, with which it was once considered conspecific (as "Lesser Golden Plover", see Sangster et al., 2002). The Pacific Golden Plover is slimmer than the American species, has a shorter primary projection, and longer legs, and is usually yellower on the back.
The breeding habitat of Pacific Golden Plover is Arctic tundra from northernmost Asia into western Alaska. It nests on the ground in a dry open area.
This wader is migratory and winters in south Asia and Australasia. A few winter in California and Hawaii, USA.  In Hawaii, the bird is known as the kolea. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.
This bird forages for food on tundra, fields, beaches and tidal flats, usually by sight. It eats insects and crustaceans and some berries.

Varicella zoster virus or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is one of eight herpesviruses known to infect humans and  vertebrates. VZV only affects humans, and commonly causes chickenpox in children, teens and young adults and herpes zoster (shingles) in adults and rarely in children. VZV is known by many names, including chickenpox virus, varicella virus, zoster virus, and human herpesvirus type 3 (HHV-3).
VZV infects the nerves, and causes a wide variety of symptoms.  After the primary infection (chickenpox), the virus goes dormant in the nerves, including the cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and autonomic ganglia.  Many years after the patient has recovered from chickenpox, VZV can reactivate to cause a number of neurologic conditions.

The Knowledge Gap Hypothesis explains that knowledge, like other forms of wealth, is often differentially distributed throughout a social system.

Thousands of years ago, urbanisation and mercantile activity along the western and eastern coast of what is today Kerala and Tamil Nadu led to the development of four large Tamil political states (Chera, Chola, Pandya and Pallavas) and a number of smaller states warring amongst themselves for dominance. Between the 3rd century BC and the 3rd century AD, Tamil people also produced native literature that came to be called Sangam literature.
Tamils were noted for their martial, religious and mercantile activities beyond their native borders. Pandyas and Cholas were historically active in Sri Lanka. Pallava traders and religious leaders travelled to South East Asia and played an important role in the cultural Indianisation of the region. Locally developed scripts such as Grantha and Pallava script induced the development of many native scripts such as Khmer, Javanese and Thai.
Tamil visual art is dominated by stylised Temple architecture in major centres and the productions of images of deities in stone and bronze. Chola bronzes, especially the Nataraja sculpture of the Chola period, have become notable as a symbol of Hinduism. Tamil performing arts are divided into popular and classical. Classical form is Bharatanatyam whereas the popular forms are known as Kuthus and performed in village temples and on street corners. Tamil cinema known as Kollywood is an important part of the Indian cinema industry. Music too is divided into classical Carnatic form and many popular genres. Although most Tamils are Hindus, most practice what is considered to be folk Hinduism, venerating a plethora of village deities. A sizeable number are Christians and Muslims. A small Jain community survives from the classical period as well. Tamil cuisine is informed by varied vegetarian and non-vegetarian items usually spiced with locally available spices. The music, the temple architecture and the stylised sculptures favoured by the Tamil people as in their ancient nation are still being learnt and practised. English historian and broadcaster Michael Wood called the Tamils the last surviving classical civilisation on Earth, because the Tamil mainstream preserved substantial elements of their past regarding belief, culture, music and literature despite of the modern globalised world.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/india/gal_india_south_03.shtml |title=Michael Wood, BBC |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Wood|first=Michael|title=A South Indian Journey: The Smile of Murugan|publisher=Penguin UK|url=http://books.google.at/books?id=sK4hIRAdIJ8C&dq=tamil+last+classical+civilization&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl]

Philip Parris "Phil" Lynott ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|n|ə|t[/tpl]; 20 August 1949 – 4 January 1986) was an Irish singer and musician. His most commercially successful group was Thin Lizzy, in which he was the founding member, principal songwriter, lead vocalist and bassist. He later also found success as a solo artist.
Growing up in Dublin in the 1960s, Lynott fronted several bands as a lead vocalist, most notably Skid Row alongside Gary Moore, before learning the bass guitar and forming Thin Lizzy in 1969. After initial success with Whiskey in the Jar, the band found strong commercial success in the mid-1970s with hits such as "The Boys Are Back in Town", "Jailbreak" and "Waiting for an Alibi", and became a popular live attraction due to the combination of Lynott's vocal and songwriting skills and the use of dual lead guitars. Towards the end of the 1970s, Lynott also embarked upon a solo career, published two books of poetry,Philip Lynott, "Songs for While I'm Away", Boxtree, 1997. and after Thin Lizzy disbanded, he assembled and fronted the band Grand Slam, of which he was the leader until it folded in 1985.
He subsequently had major UK success with Moore with the song "Out in the Fields", followed by a minor hit "Nineteen", before his death on 4 January 1986. He remains a popular figure in the rock world, and in 2005, a statue was erected in his memory.

[[Hidden camera]]

CATEGORIES: Cameras, Recording, Television genres, Hidden camera television series

A hidden camera is a still or video camera used to film people without their knowledge. The camera is "hidden" because it is either not visible to the subject being filmed, or is disguised as another object. Hidden cameras have become popular for household surveillance, and can be built into common household objects such as smoke detectors, clock radios, motion detectors, ball caps, plants, and mobile phones. Hidden cameras may also be used commercially or industrially as security cameras.

[[Liskov substitution principle]]

CATEGORIES: Object-oriented programming, Type theory, Programming principles, Formal methods, Programming language semantics

Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming. It states that, in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.).  More formally, the Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called (strong) behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote address entitled Data abstraction and hierarchy. It is a semantic rather than merely syntactic relation because it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability of types in a hierarchy, object types in particular. Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing formulated the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:
In the same paper, Liskov and Wing detailed their notion of behavioral subtyping in an extension of Hoare logic, which bears a certain resemblance with Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract in that it considers the interaction of subtyping with pre- and postconditions.

[[End-of-life (product)]]

CATEGORIES: Consumer theory, Products, Software release

"End-of-life" (EOL) is a term used with respect to a product supplied to customers, indicating that the product is in the end of its useful life (from the vendor's point-of-view), and a vendor intends to stop marketing, selling, or sustaining it. (The vendor may simply intend to limit or end support for the product.) In the specific case of product sales, a vendor may employ the more specific term "end-of-sale" (EOS).  The time-frame after the last production date depends on the product and relates to the expected product lifetime from a customer's point-of-view.  Different lifetime examples include toys from fast food chains (weeks or months), cars (10 years), and mobile phones (3 years).

CATEGORIES: 1998 television episodes, South Park (season 2) episodes, Underwear

"Gnomes" is the seventeenth episode of the second season of the animated television series South Park, and the 30th episode of the series overall. It originally aired in the United States on December 16, 1998 on Comedy Central. The episode was written by series co-founders Trey Parker and Matt Stone, as well as Pam Brady. It was directed by Parker, and was rated TV-MA in the United States. This episode marks the first appearance of Tweek Tweak and his parents.
In the episode, Harbucks (a reference to Starbucks), plans to enter the South Park coffee market, posing a threat to the local coffee business owners, the Tweak Parents. Mr. Tweak, scheming to use the boys’ school report as a platform to fight Harbucks, convinces the boys to deliver their school report on the supposed threat corporatism poses to small businesses, moving the South Park community to take action against Harbucks.
"Gnomes" satirizes the common complaint that large corporations lack consciences and drive seemingly wholesome smaller independent companies out of business. Paul Cantor described the episode as "the most fully developed defense of capitalism" ever produced by the show, due to various themes in the episode. In the episode smaller businesses are portrayed as being at least as greedy as their corporate counterparts, while their products are of lower quality compared to the products offered by large corporations.

[[Whale watching]]

CATEGORIES: Types of tourism, Whales

Whale watching is the practice of observing whales and dolphins (cetaceans) in their natural habitat. Whales are watched most commonly for recreation (cf. bird watching) but the activity can also serve scientific or educational purposes.Hoyt, E. 2009. Whale watching. In Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, 2nd Edition (Perrin, W.F., B. Würsig and J.G.M. Thewissen, eds.) Academic Press, San Diego, CA., pp1219-1223. A 2009 study, prepared for IFAW, estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generated $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.O’Connor, S., Campbell, R., Cortez, H., & Knowles, T., 2009, Whale Watching Worldwide: tourism numbers, expenditures and expanding economic benefits, a special report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Yarmouth MA, USA, prepared by Economists at Large. http://www.ifaw.org/whalewatchingworldwide The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.

[[Datasheet]]

CATEGORIES: Documents, Personal computers, Components, Technical communication

A datasheet, data sheet, or spec sheet is a document summarizing the performance and other technical characteristics of a product, machine, component (e.g. an electronic component), material, a subsystem (e.g. a power supply) or software in sufficient detail to be used by a design engineer to integrate the component into a system. Typically, a datasheet is created by the component/subsystem/software manufacturer and begins with an introductory page describing the rest of the document, followed by listings of specific characteristics, with further information on the connectivity of the devices. In cases where there is relevant source code to include, it is usually attached near the end of the document or separated into another file.
Depending on the specific purpose, a data sheet may offer an average value, a typical value, a typical range, engineering tolerances,or a nominal value. The type and source of data are usually stated on the data sheet.
A data sheet is usually used for technical communication to describe technical characteristics of an item or product. It can be published by the manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products.   By contrast, a technical specification is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service.
An electronic datasheet specifies characteristics in a formal structure that allows the information to be processed by a machine.  Such machine readable descriptions can facilitate information retrieval, display, design, testing, interfacing, verification, and system discovery.  Examples include transducer electronic data sheets for describing sensor characteristics, and Electronic device descriptions in CANopen or descriptions in markup languages, such as SensorML.

Oskar Benjamin Klein (September 15, 1894 – February 5, 1977) was a Swedish theoretical physicist.[tpl]cite journal|author=Deser, Stanley|authorlink=Stanley Deser|title=Oskar Klein|journal=Physics Today|date=June 1977|volume=30|issue=6|pages=67–68|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v30/i6/p67_s2?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3037609[/tpl]
Klein was born in Danderyd outside Stockholm, son of the chief rabbi of Stockholm, Gottlieb Klein from Humenné in Hungary and Antonie (Toni) Levy. He became a student of Svante Arrhenius at the Nobel Institute at a young age and was on the way to Jean-Baptiste Perrin in France when World War I broke out and he was drafted into the military.
From 1917, he worked a few years with Niels Bohr in the University of Copenhagen and received his doctoral degree at the University College of Stockholm (now Stockholm University) in 1921. In 1923, he received a professorship at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and moved there with his recently wedded wife, Gerda Koch from Denmark. Klein returned to Copenhagen in 1925, spent some time with Paul Ehrenfest in Leiden, then became docent at Lund University in 1926 and in 1930 accepted the offer of the professorial chair in physics at the Stockholm University College, which had previously been held by Erik Ivar Fredholm until his death in 1927. Klein was awarded the Max Planck Medal in 1959. He retired as professor emeritus in 1962.
Klein is credited for inventing the idea, part of Kaluza–Klein theory, that extra dimensions may be physically real but curled up and very small, an idea essential to string theory / M-theory.
In 1938, he proposed a boson-exchange model for charge-charging weak interactions (radioactive decay), a few years after a similar proposal by Hideki Yukawa.  His model was based on a local isotropic gauge symmetry and anticipated the later successful theory of Yang-Mills.
The Oskar Klein Memorial Lecture, held annually at the University of Stockholm, has been named after him. The Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics in Stockholm, Sweden is also in his honor.
Oskar Klein is the grandfather of Helle Klein.

[[Midnight sun]]

CATEGORIES: Earth phenomena, Arctic geography terminology

The midnight sun is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. Around the summer solstice (approximately June 21 in the north and December 22 in the south) the sun is visible for the full 24 hours, given fair weather. The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the farther towards either pole one goes. Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 90 km outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year.
There are no permanent human settlements south of the Antarctic Circle, so the countries and territories whose populations experience it are limited to those crossed by the Arctic Circle, i.e. Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut), Greenland, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States (Alaska). A quarter of Finland's territory lies north of the Arctic Circle and at the country's northernmost point the sun does not set at all for 60 days during summer. In Svalbard, Norway, the northernmost inhabited region of Europe, there is no sunset from approximately 19 April to 23 August. The extreme sites are the poles where the sun can be continuously visible for a half year.
The opposite phenomenon, polar night, occurs in winter when the sun stays below the horizon throughout the day.
Since the axial tilt of the Earth is considerable (approximately 23 degrees 27 minutes) the sun does not set at high latitudes in (local) summer. The duration of sunlight increases from one day during the summer solstice at the polar circle to several weeks only 100 km closer to the pole, to six months at the poles. At extreme latitudes, it is usually referred to as polar day. 
At the poles themselves, the sun only rises once and sets once each year. During the six months when the sun is above the horizon it spends the days continuously moving in circles around the observer, gradually spiralling higher and reaching its highest circuit of the sky at the summer solstice.
Due to atmospheric refraction and also because the sun is a disk rather than a point, the midnight sun may be experienced at latitudes slightly below the polar circle, though not exceeding one degree (depending on local conditions). For example, Iceland is known for its midnight sun, even though most of it (Grímsey is the exception) is slightly south of the Arctic Circle. For the same reasons, the period of sunlight at the poles is slightly more than six months. Even the northern extremities of Scotland (and those places on similar latitudes such as St. Petersburg) experience twilight in the northern sky at around the summer solstice.
Observers at heights appreciably above sea level can experience extended periods of midnight sun as a result of the 'dip' of the horizon viewed from altitude.

Dinosaurs belonging to the suborder Theropoda were primarily carnivorous, although a number of theropod groups evolved herbivory, omnivory, and insectivory. Theropods first appeared during the Carnian age of the late Triassic period about 230 million years ago (Ma) and included the sole large terrestrial carnivores from the Early Jurassic until at least the close of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma. In the Jurassic, birds evolved from small specialized coelurosaurian theropods, and are today represented by 10,000 living species.
Among the features linking theropod dinosaurs to birds are a furcula (wishbone), air-filled bones, brooding of the eggs, and (in coelurosaurs, at least) feathers.

As part of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, she attempted to intercept a German force that bombarded the North Sea coast of England in December 1914, but was unsuccessful. She was refitting in early 1915 and missed the Battle of Dogger Bank in January, but participated in the largest fleet action of the war, the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916. She was hit twice by the German battlecruiser [tpl]SMS|Derfflinger||2[/tpl] during the early part of the battle and her magazines exploded shortly afterwards, sinking the ship.
Her wreck was discovered in 1991 and rests in pieces, some of which are upside down, on the floor of the North Sea. Queen Mary is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 as it is the grave of 1,266 officers and men.

SMS ''Lützow[tpl]efn|name=SMS[/tpl] was the second [tpl]sclass-|Derfflinger|battlecruiser[/tpl] built by the German Kaiserliche Marine ([tpl]lang-en|Imperial Navy[/tpl]) before World War I. Ordered as a replacement for the old protected cruiser [tpl]SMS|Kaiserin Augusta||2[/tpl], Lützow was launched on 29 November 1913, but not completed until 1916. Lützow'' was a sister ship to [tpl]SMS|Derfflinger||2[/tpl] from which she differed slightly in that she was armed with an additional pair of 15 cm (5.9 inch) secondary guns and had an additional watertight compartment in her hull. She was named in honor of the Prussian general Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow who fought in the Napoleonic Wars.
Lützow was commissioned on 8 August 1915, but did not join the I Scouting Group until 20 March due to engine damage during trials. This was after most of the major actions conducted by the German battlecruiser force had taken place. As a result, Lützow saw very little action during the war. She took part in only one bombardment operation: the Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April 1916, after which she became Admiral Franz von Hipper's flagship. One month later, the ship was heavily engaged during the Battle of Jutland, on 31 May–1 June. During the battle, Lützow sank the British battlecruiser [tpl]HMS|Invincible|1907|6[/tpl] and is sometimes given credit for the armored cruiser [tpl]HMS|Defence|1907|6[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=154[/tpl] However, she was heavily damaged by an estimated 24 heavy-caliber shell hits. With her bow thoroughly flooded, the ship was unable to make the return voyage to German ports; her crew was evacuated and she was sunk by torpedoes fired by one of her escorts, the torpedo boat [tpl]SMS|G38||2[/tpl].

[[Compis]]

CATEGORIES: Personal computers, Goods manufactured in Sweden

Compis (Swedish name), Scandis (Norwegian name) was a computer system designed and sold to schools beginning 1984. Since it was intended for educational use, it received the name Compis, which is short for COMPuter In School. The name can also be interpreted as a pun on the Scandinavian word kompis, meaning friend or pal. The development was started by Svenska Datorer in 1982 and was overtaken by TeleNova when the former went bankrupt. The computer was distributed by Esselte and mostly marketed towards, and sold to, Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish gymnasium-level schools.
The computer was based on the Intel 80186 CPU and with CP/M-86 as the operating system in ROM (although it could also run MS-DOS from disk). The computer had a wide selection of ports, including one for a light pen. The Compis project was criticized from the start, and as the move to IBM PC compatibility came it was left behind and finally cancelled in 1988 although it was in use well into the 1990s.
Notable applications being run on the Compis in an educational environment was:
Some schools had simple local area networks of Compis/Scandis computers, where 10-20 machines shared one hard disk of typically 10MB capacity.

Norman Lewis Corwin (May 3, 1910 – October 18, 2011) was an American writer, screenwriter, producer, essayist and teacher of journalism and writing. His earliest and biggest successes were in the writing and directing of radio drama during the 1930s and 1940s.
Corwin was among the first producers to regularly use entertainment—even light entertainment—to tackle serious social issues. In this area he was a peer of Orson Welles and William N. Robson, and an inspiration to other later radio/TV writers such as Rod Serling, Gene Roddenberry, Norman Lear, J. Michael Straczynski and Yuri Rasovsky.
He was the son of Samuel and Rose Corwin and was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Corwin was a major figure during the Golden Age of Radio. During the 1930s and 1940s he was a writer and producer of many radio programs in many genres: history, biography, fantasy, fiction, poetry and drama. He was the writer and creator of series such as The Columbia Workshop, 13 By Corwin, 26 By Corwin and others. He recently was a lecturer at the University of Southern California.
Corwin won a One World Award, two Peabody Medals, an Emmy, a Golden Globe, a duPont-Columbia Award; he was nominated for an Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay for Lust for Life (1956). On May 12, 1990, he received an Honorary Doctorate from Lincoln College. In 1996 he received the Doctor of Humane Letters honoris causa from California Lutheran University. Corwin was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1993. 
A documentary film on Corwin's life, A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin, won an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Feature) in 2006.  Les Guthman's feature documentary on Mr. Corwin's career, Corwin aired on PBS in the 1990s.

The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the dissolved sugar, which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups, and the water. Syrups can be made by dissolving sugar in water or by reducing naturally sweet juices such as cane juice, sorghum juice, or maple sap. Corn syrup is made from corn starch using an enzymatic process that converts it to sugars. Technically and scientifically, the term syrup is also employed to denote viscous, generally residual, liquids, containing substances other than sugars in solution.

Although considered a winter squash, acorn squash belongs to the same species as all summer squashes (including zucchini and yellow crookneck squash).
The most common variety is dark green in color, often with a single splotch of orange on the side or top. However, newer varieties have arisen, including Golden Acorn, so named for its glowing yellow colour, as well as varieties that are white. Acorn squashes can also be variegated (multi-colored).[tpl]Cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | authorlink = Leah A. Zeldes | title = Eat this!

Acorn squashes typically weigh one to two pounds and are between four and seven inches long.[tpl]cite book|last=Mariani|first=John F|title=Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink|year=1999|publisher=Lebhar-Friedman Books|isbn=0-86730-784-6|page=2[/tpl]  Acorn squash is good and hardy to save throughout the winter in storage, keeping several months in a cool dry location such as a cold cellar.
Acorn squash is very easily grown. Seeds are started after all danger of frost is past and the soil is warm or within 3–4 weeks before the predicted last frost date in the area.  Seeds directly sown are placed one inch deep, 5-6 to a hill; hills are 6 feet in all direction from other hills. As with other squash varieties, the acorn squash produces yellow trumpet flowers which are also edible. Tops (about three inches) from the end are also edible. They are one of the common vegetable (as greens) in the Philippines. The stem has a prickly feel. Roughly 85 days after germinating, acorn squash are ready to be harvested. Curing takes a week to ten days in a sheltered area outside, or a warm dry place like a dry storage space, protected from frost.
Acorn squash is most commonly baked, but can also be microwaved, sauteed or steamed. It may be stuffed with rice, meat or vegetable mixtures. The seeds of the squash are also eaten, usually after being toasted. This squash is not as rich in beta-carotene as other winter squashes, but is a good source of dietary fiber and potassium, as well as smaller amounts of vitamins C and B, magnesium, and manganese.
Indigenous to North and Central America, the squash was introduced to early European settlers by Native Americans.

[[Mel-frequency cepstrum]]
CATEGORIES: Signal processing

In sound processing, the mel-frequency cepstrum (MFC) is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a  linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency.
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are coefficients that collectively make up an MFC. They are derived from a type of cepstral representation of the audio clip (a nonlinear "spectrum-of-a-spectrum"). The difference between the cepstrum and the mel-frequency cepstrum is that in the MFC, the frequency bands are equally spaced on the mel scale, which approximates the human auditory system's response more closely than the linearly-spaced frequency bands used in the normal cepstrum. This frequency warping can allow for better representation of sound, for example, in audio compression.
MFCCs are commonly derived as follows:[tpl]cite book | chapter = HMM-based audio keyword generation | author = Min Xu et al. | title = Advances in Multimedia Information Processing - PCM 2004: 5th Pacific Rim Conference on Multimedia | editor = Kiyoharu Aizawa, Yuichi Nakamura, Shin'ichi Satoh | publisher = Springer | year = 2004 | isbn = 3-540-23985-5 | url = http://cemnet.ntu.edu.sg/home/asltchia/publication/AudioAnalysisUnderstanding/Conference/HMM-Based%20Audio%20Keyword%20Generation.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Sahidullah|first=Md.|coauthors=Saha, Goutam|title=Design, analysis and experimental evaluation of block based transformation in MFCC computation for speaker recognition|journal=Speech Communication|date=May 2012|volume=54|issue=4|pages=543–565|doi=10.1016/j.specom.2011.11.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639311001622[/tpl]
There can be variations on this process, for example: differences in the shape or spacing of the windows used to map the scale,Fang Zheng, Guoliang Zhang and Zhanjiang Song (2001), "Comparison of Different Implementations of MFCC," J.

[[Single (baseball)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball terminology, Batting statistics

[tpl]Other uses|Single (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Single[/tpl]
In baseball, a single is the most common type of base hit, accomplished through the act of a batter safely reaching first base by hitting a fair ball (thus becoming a runner) and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out.  As an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play; this is one type of a fielder's choice.  Also, a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder's error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out (as a fielder's choice) is not credited with a single.
On a single hit to the outfield, any runners on second base or third base normally score, and sometimes the runner from first base is able to advance to third base.  Depending on the location of the hit, a quick recovery by the outfielder can prevent such an advance or create a play on the advancing runner.
Hitters who focus on hitting singles rather than doubles or home runs are often called "contact hitters".  Contact hitters who rely on positioning their hits well and having fast running speed to achieve singles are often called "slap hitters".  Ty Cobb, Pete Rose, Tony Gwynn, and Ichiro Suzuki are examples of contact hitters; of these, Rose and Suzuki might be called slap hitters.

[[Fielder's choice]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball terminology

In baseball, fielder's choice (abbreviated FC) is a term used to refer to a variety of plays involving an offensive player reaching a base due to the defense's attempt to put out another baserunner, or the defensive team's indifference to his advance. Fielder's choice is not called by the umpires on the field of play; rather, it is recorded by the official scorer to account for the offensive player's advance without crediting him with an offensive statistic such as a hit or stolen base.
Though there are several definitions of fielder's choice, the most common (and the only one commonly referred to as FC) involves a fielder fielding a fair ball and choosing to try to put out another baserunner, thereby allowing the batter-runner to safely reach first base. The defensive player may or may not have an opportunity to retire the batter runner. If a preceding runner is retired on a force out, the batter will not be rewarded with a hit and will be scored a Fielders Choice (FC).  Other plays that fall under the definition of FC are usually referred to using other terms such as "defensive indifference" or "on the throw."

[[Double (baseball)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball terminology, Batting statistics

In baseball, a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire, without the benefit of a fielder's misplay (see error) or another runner being put out on a fielder's choice.

[[Triple (baseball)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball terminology, Batting statistics

In baseball, a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball, with neither the benefit of a fielder's misplay (see error) nor another runner being put out on a fielder's choice.
Because a hit only counts as a triple without a fielding error or a fielder's choice, triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball. It often requires a hit to an unoccupied part of the ballpark (as in an opposite-field hit) or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield. It also requires that the batter be able to hit the ball solidly but also that he be able to run quickly. This combination of power and speed is rare, and combined with the trend for modern ballparks to have smaller outfields (to increase the number of home runs hit), it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of players who played earlier in the sport's history.
Because the hit is so rare, a triple is considered one of the most exciting plays in baseball.  It is also an essential element in the achievement of hitting for the cycle.
Triples were much more common in the dead-ball era of baseball.

[[Caught stealing]]
CATEGORIES: Baserunning statistics, Catching statistics

In baseball, a runner is charged, and the fielders involved are credited, with a time caught stealing when the runner attempts to advance or lead off from one base to another without the ball being batted and then is tagged out by a fielder while making the attempt. A time caught stealing cannot be charged to a batter-runner, a runner who is still advancing as the direct result of reaching base. In baseball statistics, caught stealing is denoted by CS.[tpl]cite web|title=Baseball Basics: Abbreviations|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/baseball_basics/abbreviations.jsp|work=MLB.com|accessdate=April 20, 2014[/tpl]

[[Run (baseball)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball rules, Baserunning statistics, Baseball terminology, Scoring

In baseball, a run is scored when a player advances around first, second and third base and returns safely to home plate, touching the bases in that order, before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured. A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely "on base" (that is, on first, second, or third) as a runner and subsequently brings him home. The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent.
With two outs at the start of play, the batter must reach first base and any base runners obligated to run to the next base must reach the next base on a batted ball if a run is to be counted. Thus if a baserunner running from third base crosses home plate with two out before a batter is put out on a ground out or before a fly ball is caught after two outs, then the run that would otherwise score is null; likewise, if a conventional double play is made with one out on a ground ball involving forces at other bases, the run that would otherwise score before the third out is registered is void. But if the play involves no batted ball, the baserunner who scores before the third out is made scores a run. Example: with runners at first and third, the runner at first base attempts to steal second base. The runner on third takes off for home plate while the runner from first base is in a rundown. Should the runner from third score before the baserunner originally at first base be put out, then a run scores.
In baseball statistics, a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run (R), sometimes referred to as a "run scored".  While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic, it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in (RBIs). Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent; for a more sophisticated assessment of a player's contribution toward producing runs for his team, see runs created.
A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics, which differentiate between standard earned runs (for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility) and so-called unearned runs scored due to fielding errors. If a pitching substitution occurs while a runner is on base, and that runner eventually scores a run, the pitcher who allowed the player to get on base is charged with the run even though he was no longer pitching when the run scored.

The Hutton Inquiry was a 2003 judicial inquiry in the UK chaired by Lord Hutton, who was appointed by the Labour government to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of David Kelly, a biological warfare expert and former UN weapons inspector in Iraq. 
On 18 July 2003, Kelly, an employee of the Ministry of Defence, was found dead after he had been named as the source of quotations used by BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan. These quotations had formed the basis of media reports claiming that Tony Blair's Labour government had knowingly "sexed up" the "September Dossier", a report into Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.

[[Sacrifice bunt]]

CATEGORIES: Batting (baseball), Baseball plays

In baseball, a sacrifice bunt (also called a sacrifice hit) is a batter's act of deliberately  bunting the ball, before there are two outs, in a manner that allows a runner on base to advance to another base. The batter is almost always sacrificed (and to a certain degree that is the intent of the batter) but sometimes reaches base due to an error or fielder's choice. Sometimes the batter may safely reach base by simply outrunning the throw to first; this is not scored as a sacrifice bunt but rather a single.
The most opportune situations for sacrifice bunts occur when a runner is on first base, or runners are on both first and second base. The runners try to advance as soon as they see the ball bunted. A properly executed sacrifice bunt in this scenario would put the ball up the first base line with a runner on first, or down the third base line with runners at first and second. This avoids a double play and results in the runner(s) advancing to second (and third) base, "in scoring position".
A successful sacrifice bunt does not count as an at bat, does not impact a player's batting average, and counts as a plate appearance.  However, unlike a sacrifice fly, a sacrifice bunt does not count against a player in determining on-base percentage. If the official scorer believes that the batter was attempting to bunt for a base hit, and not solely to advance the runners, the batter is charged an at bat and is not credited with a sacrifice bunt.
In leagues without a designated hitter, sacrifice bunts are most commonly attempted by pitchers, who are typically not productive hitters. Managers consider that if a pitcher's at bat will probably result in an out, they might as well go out in a way most likely to advance the runners. Some leadoff hitters also bunt frequently in similar situations and may be credited with a sacrifice, but as they are often highly skilled bunters and faster runners, they are often trying to get on base as well as advance runners.
A sacrifice bunt attempted while a runner is on third is called a squeeze play.
A sacrifice bunt attempted while a runner on third is attempting to steal home is called a suicide squeeze.
Although a sacrifice bunt is not the same as a sacrifice fly, both fell under the same statistical category until 1954.
In scoring, a sacrifice bunt may be denoted by SH, S, or occasionally, SAC.

[[Complete game]]

CATEGORIES: Pitching statistics

In baseball, a complete game (denoted by CG) is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher.[tpl]cite book|last=Dickson |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Dickson | title=The new Dickson baseball dictionary |page=130 |year=1999 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | isbn=978-0-15-600580-7| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=afQVWhAm1TEC&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20new%20dickson%20baseball%20dictionary&pg=PA130#v=onepage&q&f=false| accessdate=August 27, 2011[/tpl] The frequency of complete games has evolved since the early days of baseball. The complete game was essentially an expectation in the early 20th century and pitchers completed almost of all of their games started. In modern baseball, the feat is much more rare and no pitcher has reached 30 complete games in a season since 1975.

[[Innings pitched]]

CATEGORIES: Pitching statistics

In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game.  Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched.  One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning.  Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1,  72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent [tpl]frac|34|1|3[/tpl] innings, [tpl]frac|72|2|3[/tpl] innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively.
Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched. It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game, give up several hits and possibly even several runs, and be removed before achieving any outs, thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched.

[[Double play]]

CATEGORIES: Fielding statistics, Baseball terminology, Baseball plays

In baseball, a double play (denoted on statistics sheets by DP) for a team or a fielder is the act of making two outs during the same continuous playing action. In baseball slang, making a double play is referred to as "turning two".
Double plays are also known as "the pitcher's best friend" because they disrupt offense more than any other play, except for the rare triple play. Pitchers often select pitches that make a double play more likely (typically a pitch easily hit as a ground ball to a middle infielder) and teams on defense alter infield positions to make a ground ball more likely to be turned into a double play. Because a double play ends an inning in a one-out situation, it often makes the scoring of a run impossible in that inning. In a no-out situation with runners at first base and third base, the double play may be so desirable that the defensive team allows a runner to score from third base so that two outs are made and further scoring by the batting team is more difficult.

[[Triple play]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball terminology, Baseball plays, Fielding statistics

In baseball, a triple play (denoted by TP) is the rare act of making three outs during the same continuous play.
There are many ways a triple play can be performed; most of them are done with runners on first and second base.  Typically, a ball hit to the shortstop or third baseman is fielded, the runner heading to third is forced out or tagged out, the ball is thrown to second base for a force play, and then finally to first to throw out the batter.  Another likely sequence is a line drive to the shortstop or second baseman that is caught without the runners noticing or after they have taken large leads (as in the case of a hit and run), the runners then being forced or tagged out when they fail to tag up.

[[Error (baseball)]]
CATEGORIES: Fielding statistics, Baseball terminology

In baseball statistics, an error is the act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases, when such an advance would have been prevented given ordinary effort by the fielder.
The term  error can also refer to the play in which an error was committed.
An error does not count as a hit but still counts as an at bat for the batter unless, in the scorer's judgment, the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base(s) reached was the result of the fielder's mistake. In that case, the play will be scored both as a hit (for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to) and an error. However, if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder's mistake, it is scored as a "hit on error," and treated the same as if a batter was put out, hence lowering his batting average.
Similarly, a batter does not receive credit for an RBI when runs score on an error, unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake. For example, if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a sacrifice fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in.
If a play should have resulted in a fielder's choice with a runner being put out and the batter reaching base safely but the runner is safe due to an error, the play will be scored as a fielder's choice, with no hit being awarded to the batter and an error charged against the fielder.
Passed balls and wild pitches are separate statistical categories and are not scored as errors.
If a batted ball were hit on the fly into foul territory, with the batting team having no runner(s) on base, and a fielder misplayed such ball for an error, it is possible for a team on the winning side of a perfect game to commit at least one error, yet still qualify as a perfect game.
There is a curious loophole in the rules on errors for catchers. If a catcher makes a "wild throw" in an attempt to prevent a stolen base and the runner is safe, the catcher is not charged with an error even if it could be argued that the runner would have been put out with "ordinary effort."  There is therefore a "no fault" condition for the catcher attempting to prevent a steal. However, when considering that the majority of stolen base attempts are successful (around 2 successes per failure), this "no fault rule" is understandable due to the extreme difficulty of throwing out runners. If the runner takes an additional base due to the wild throw, an error is charged for that advance. However, if the catcher's glove is hit by the bat, it is counted as a catcher's interference and the catcher is given an error unless the batter gets a hit off the play.

[[Vagbhata]]
CATEGORIES: Kashmiri people, Kashmiri writers, Ancient Indian physicians, Ayurvedacharyas

Vāgbhaṭa (वाग्भट) is one of the most influential classical writers of ayurveda.  Several works are associated with his name as author, principally the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha (अष्टाङ्गसंग्रह) and the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā (अष्टाङ्गहृदयसंहिता). The best current research, however, argues in detail that these two works cannot be the product of a single author.  Indeed the whole question of the relationship of these two works, and their authorship, is very difficult and still far from solution.[tpl]cite book|last=Meulenbeld|first=G. Jan|title=History of Indian Medical Literature|date=1999–2002|publisher=Egbert Forsten|location=Groningen[/tpl], vol.IA, p.645  Both works make frequent reference to the earlier classical works, the Carakasaṃhitā and the Suśrutasaṃhitā.Ibid., vol. IA, pp.391-593  Vāgbhaṭa is said, in the closing verses of the  Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha, to have lived in Sind (today in Pakistan), and to have been the son of Siṃhagupta and pupil of Avalokita.  He was a Buddhist, as is shown by his explicit praise for the Buddha by name at the start of the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha, and his praise of the Buddha under the title "Unprecedented Teacher" in the opening verse of the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā.  His work contains syncretic elements.
As per modern scholarship he was an ethnic Kashmiri,Anna Akasoy & co., Islam and Tibet: Interactions Along the Musk Routes, Ashgate Publishing Limited (2011), p.76 and for instance the German Indologist Claus Vogel said "...judging by the fact that he expressly defines Andhra and Dravida as the names of two southern peoples or kingdoms and repeatedly mentions Kashmirian terms for particular plants, he is likely to have been a Northerner and a native of Kashmir..."Claus Vogel, Vāgbhaṭa Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā. The First Five Chapters of Its Tibetan Version, Franz Steiner (1965), p.13
Vagbhata was a disciple of Charaka. Both of his books were originally written in Sanskrit with 3000 sutra. According to Vagbhata, 85% of diseases can be cured without a doctor; only 15% of diseases require a doctor.
The ancient Science of Life, Ayurveda, encompasses the sum total of the experience and knowledge of great sages and physicians, going back almost 5000 years. When speaking of the main proponents of Ayurveda during ancient times, three names instantly spring to the mind. They are Sushruta, one the earliest surgeons, Charaka, a medical genius, and Vagbhata. Together they are considered to be ‘The Trinity” of Ayurvedic knowledge, with Vagbhata coming after the other two. According to some scholars, Vagbhata lived in Sindh around the sixth century. Not much is known about him personally, except that he was most likely to have been a Buddhist, as he makes a reference to Lord Buddha in his writings, and his sons, grandsons, and disciples were all Buddhists. It is also believed that he was taught Ayurvedic medicine by his father and a Buddhist monk, named Avalokita.

The book is a look at the state of business and industry in the United States and the power they hold over the U.S. government.  In particular the book criticizes corporations who care more for shareholders than the safety and wellbeing of the communities who work for them.  The book is part of Moore's ongoing campaign for increased corporate accountability.
The book was first published in hardback in 1996 and then later published in paperback in 1997.
Moore refers to corporations receiving government tax breaks as "corporate welfare mothers".  There is also a chapter about Hillary Clinton as well as two on OJ Simpson - one where Moore claims OJ was innocent of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, another where Moore claims OJ was guilty. And yet another chapter where Moore details his unsuccessful endeavors to have State Representative from the 46th District of California, Bob Dornan, involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation.

[[Win–loss record (pitching)]]

CATEGORIES: Pitching statistics

In baseball and softball, a pitcher's win–loss record (also referred to simply as their record) indicates the amount of wins (denoted "W") and losses (denoted "L") they have been credited with. For example, a 20–10 win–loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses.
In each game, one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win (the "winning pitcher") and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss (the "losing pitcher") in their respective statistics. These pitchers are collectively known as the pitchers of record. The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known as a decision, and only one pitcher for each game receives each type of decision. A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have a no decision. In certain situations, another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save, and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides, but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who receives the win.
The decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance with the league's rules. The official scorer does not assign a winning or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited, such as those that are tied at the time of forfeiture. If the game is tied (a rare event), no pitchers are awarded any decision. A pitcher's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions (wins plus losses), and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places.

[[Coffee percolator]]
CATEGORIES: Coffee preparation, Cooking appliances

A coffee percolator is a type of pot used to brew coffee by continually cycling the boiling or nearly-boiling brew through the grounds using gravity until the required strength is reached.[tpl]cite web|title=About Coffee: Coffee percolator|url=http://www.araazzurro.ca/about_coffee.aspx#Coffee_percolator|year=2007|publisher=Ara Azzurro|accessdate=2008-01-09[/tpl]
Coffee percolators once enjoyed great popularity but were supplanted in the early 1970s by automatic drip coffee makers. Percolators often expose the grounds to higher temperatures than other brewing methods, and may recirculate already brewed coffee through the beans. As a result, coffee brewed with a percolator is susceptible to over-extraction. Percolation may remove some of the volatile compounds in the beans, resulting in a pleasant aroma during brewing, but a less flavoursome cup. However, percolator enthusiasts praise the percolator's hotter, more 'robust' coffee, and maintain that the potential pitfalls of this brewing method can be eliminated by careful control of the brewing process.

Bury is surrounded by several smaller settlements, which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, with Bury as the largest settlement and administrative centre.
Historically a part of Lancashire, Bury emerged during the Industrial Revolution as a mill town centred on textile manufacture.
Bury is regionally notable for its open-air market - Bury Market - and its popularity has been increased since the introduction of the Manchester Metrolink tram system, which terminates in the town. The market is known for its supply of a local traditional dish - black pudding, served hot or cold and can be eaten either as a takeaway snack, or more commonly as an accompaniment or main ingredient of a meal starter or main course.
One of Bury's most notable residents was Sir Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, founder of the Metropolitan Police Service and the Conservative Party. A monument to Peel is outside Bury parish church and another, the austere Peel Monument, stands on a hill overlooking the locality.

The term Negrito refers to several ethnic groups of the Australoid race who inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia.Snow, Philip. The Star Raft: China's Encounter With Africa. Cornell Univ. Press, 1989 (ISBN 0801495830) Their current populations include 12 Andamanese peoples of the Andaman Islands, six Semang peoples of Malaysia, the Mani of Thailand, and the Aeta, Agta, Ati, and 30 other peoples of the Philippines.
Genetically, Negritos are the most distant human population from Africans at most loci studied thus far (except for MC1R, which codes for dark skin).
They have also been shown to have separated early from other Asians, suggesting that they are either surviving descendants of settlers from an early migration out of Africa, commonly referred to as the Proto-Australoids or Negroids, or that they are descendants of one of the founder populations of modern humans.[tpl]Citation | last1 = Kashyap | first1 = VK | last2 = Sitalaximi | first2 = T | last3 = Sarkar | first3 = BN | last4 = Trivedi | first4 = R | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2003 | title = Molecular relatedness of the aboriginal groups of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with similar ethnic populations | url = http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/IJHG/IJHG-03-0-000-000-2003-Web/IJHG-03-1-001-067-2003-Abst-PDF/IJHG-03-1-005-011-2003-Kashyap/IJHG-03-1-005-011-2003-Kashyap.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The International Journals of Human Genetics | volume = 3 | pages = 5–11 | postscript = .

The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as a merger of the municipal boroughs of Altrincham, Sale, and Stretford, the urban districts of Bowdon, Hale, and Urmston and part of Bucklow Rural District. All were previously in Cheshire, apart from Stretford and Urmston which were in Lancashire. The River Mersey flows through the borough, separating North Trafford from South Trafford. Historically the Mersey also acted as the boundary between the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.
The Trafford area has a long heritage, with evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Roman activity. Amongst the relics of the past are two castles – one of them a Scheduled Ancient Monument – and over 200 listed buildings. The area underwent change in the late 19th century and the population rapidly expanded with the arrival of the railway. Trafford is the home of Manchester United F.C. and Lancashire County Cricket Club and since 2002 the Imperial War Museum North.
Trafford has a strong economy with low levels of unemployment and contains both Trafford Park industrial estate and the Trafford Centre, a large out-of-town shopping centre. Apart from the City of Manchester, Trafford is the only borough in Greater Manchester to be above the national average for weekly income. Socially, the area includes both working class areas like Old Trafford and Stretford and middle class ones such as Bowdon and Hale. Altrincham and Sale West is one of the two parliamentary constituencies in Greater Manchester to be held by the Conservative Party, the other being Bury North.

[[Funitel]]

CATEGORIES: Aerial lifts, Ski lift types

A funitel is a type of aerial lift, generally used to transport skiers.  The name funitel is a portmanteau between the French words funiculaire and telepherique.  Funitels have not only been used as a means to transport skiers; there is one used to transport finished cars between different areas of a factory.  Recently, more and more funitels have been added to ski areas.
When used to transport skiers, funitels are a fast way to get to a higher altitude. However, because skis or snowboard have to be taken off and held during the trip, and because of the (usual) absence of seats, funitels can sometimes be uncomfortable for long trips, in the same way other large gondolas can be. Funitels combine a short time between successive cabins with a high capacity (20-30 peopleLift-World :: Lift-Database - Funitels) per cabin. Funitels are able to tolerate higher wind speeds than classic gondola lifts because they are clamped to two steel cables instead of one.

It lies on elevated ground [tpl]convert|7|mi|km|0[/tpl] southeast of Manchester city centre, at the point where the rivers Goyt and Tame merge to create the River Mersey. Stockport is the largest settlement in the metropolitan borough of the same name. As of the 2001 Census the town had a population of 136,082 and the wider borough 284,528.
Historically, most of the town was in Cheshire, but the area to the north of the Mersey was in Lancashire.  Stockport in the 16th century was a small town entirely on the south bank of the Mersey, and known for the cultivation of hemp and rope manufacture. In the 18th century the town had one of the first mechanised silk factories in the British Isles. However, Stockport's predominant industries of the 19th century were the cotton and allied industries. Stockport was also at the centre of the country's hatting industry, which by 1884 was exporting more than six million hats a year; the last hat works in Stockport closed in 1997.
Dominating the western approaches to the town is the Stockport Viaduct. Built in 1840, the viaduct's 27 brick arches carry the mainline railways from Manchester to Birmingham and London over the River Mersey. This structure featured as the background in many paintings by L. S. Lowry.

[tpl]About|the local government district||Sefton (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Sefton[/tpl]

The Borough of Sefton is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, England and its local authority is Sefton Council. Sefton was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, by the amalgamation of the former county boroughs of Bootle and Southport, and, from the administrative county of Lancashire, the municipal borough of Crosby, the urban districts of Formby and Litherland, and part of the Rural District of West Lancashire. It also formed part of the new county of Merseyside. The borough consists of a coastal strip of land on the Irish Sea, and extends from Bootle in the south, to Southport in the north. In the south-east, it extends inland to Maghull. The district is bounded by Liverpool to the south, Knowsley to the south-east, and West Lancashire to the east.
It is named after the village and parish of Sefton, near Maghull, that had formerly served as the seat of the Molyneux family and the watermill located there served as inspiration for Sefton Council's Crest. When the borough was created in the Local Government Act 1972 a name was sought that would not unduly identify the borough with any of its constituent parts, particularly the former county boroughs of Bootle and Southport. The locality had strong links with both the Earl of Sefton and the Earl of Derby, resident of Knowsley Hall, and given the fact that the immediately adjacent borough was subsequently named Knowsley it seems equally likely that the choice of name was derived from the names of the local nobility. A Sefton Rural District covering some of the villages in the district had existed from 1894 to 1932.

The British Chess Championship is organised by the English Chess Federation. There are separate championships for men and women. Since 1923 there have been sections for juniors, and since 1982 there has been an over-sixty championship. The championship venue usually changes every year and has been held in different locations in England, Scotland, Wales and once on the Isle of Man. However, although the current series of the Championship has run since 1904, it has never been held in Northern Ireland.British Chess Championship Venues at chess.about.com[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl]
The championship was originally open to citizens of any Commonwealth country and has previously been won by Mir Sultan Khan (India) and Abe Yanofsky (Canada). However in 2002 when the Indian R. B. Ramesh finished first and several other Indians took top prizes it led to many top Britons not competing in the 2003 championship and accompanied criticism that the British Championship was not serving the interests of British players. This, combined with the victory of Indian Abhijit Kunte in 2003, led to an announcement from the organisers that from 2004 only British and Irish players would be eligible to take part.

[tpl]Other uses|Not guilty (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Not guilty[/tpl]

In the common law tradition, an acquittal formally certifies that the accused is free from the charge of an offense, as far as the criminal law is concerned. This is so even where the prosecution is abandoned nolle prosequi. The finality of an acquittal is dependent on the jurisdiction. In some countries, such as the United States, under the rules of double jeopardy and autrefois acquit, an acquittal operates to bar the retrial of the accused for the same offense, even if new evidence surfaces that further implicates the accused. The effect of an acquittal on criminal proceedings is the same whether it results from a jury verdict, or whether it results from the operation of some other rule that discharges the accused. In other countries, the prosecuting authority may appeal an acquittal similar to how a defendant may appeal a conviction.

Scallops are a cosmopolitan family, found in all of the world's oceans.
Many scallops are highly prized as a food source; the name "scallop" is also applied to the meat of these animals when it is used as seafood. The brightly colored, fan-shaped shells of some scallops, with their radiating, fluted patterns, are valued by shell collectors, and have been used  since ancient times as motifs in art and design.

[[Concept and object]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy of language, Philosophy of mind

In the philosophy of language, the distinction between concept and object is attributable to the German philosopher Gottlob Frege.
According to Frege, any sentence that expresses a singular thought consists of an expression (a proper name or a general term plus the definite article) that signifies an Object together with a  predicate (the copula "is", plus a general term accompanied by the indefinite article or an adjective) that signifies (bedeutet) a Concept.  Thus "Socrates is a philosopher" consists of "Socrates", which signifies the Object Socrates, and "is a philosopher", which signifies the Concept of being a philosopher.
This was a considerable departure from the traditional term logic, in which every proposition (i.e. sentence) consisted of two general terms joined by the copula "is".
The distinction was of fundamental importance to the development of logic and mathematics.  Frege's distinction helped to clarify the notions of a set, of the membership relation between element and set, and of empty and infinite sets.  However, Frege's conception of a class (in his terminology an extension of a concept) differs from the current iterative conception of a set.
Frege's distinction leads to the famous difficulty or "awkwardness of language" that some expressions which purport to signify a concept - Frege's example is "the concept horse" - are grammatically expressions that by his criterion signify an Object.  Thus "the concept horse is not a concept, whereas the city of Berlin is a city".
Anthony Kenny sought to justify the distinction, other philosophers such as Hartley Slater and Crispin Wright have argued that the distinguished category of entity cannot be associated with predication in the way that individual objects are associated with the use of singular terms.

[[Parish ale]]
CATEGORIES: English folklore, Fairs in England, Beer festivals in the United Kingdom, Beer culture, Charity events in the United Kingdom, History of Christianity in England, Norman and Medieval England, Tudor England

The Parish ale was a festival in an English parish at which ale made and donated for the event was the chief drink.  The word "ale" was generally used as part of a compound term.  Thus there was the leet-ale (held on "leet", the manorial court day); the lamb-ale (held at lamb-shearing); the Whitsun-ale (held at Whitsun), the clerk-ale, the church-ale etc.  The word "bridal" originally derives from bride-ale, the wedding feast.  The bid-ale, once very common throughout England, was a "benefit" feast to which a general invitation was given, and all those attending were expected to make some contribution to help the object of the "benefit", usually a poor person or family.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.websters-dictionary-online.net/LA/SC/Bi/Bid-ale.html|title=Bid-ale|last=Anon|work=Websters online dictionary|publisher=Philip M. Parker, INSEAD|accessdate=16 April 2010[/tpl]  These parish festivals were of much ecclesiastical and social importance in medieval England.  The chief purpose of the church-ale (which was originally instituted to honour the church saint)  and the clerk-ale, was to facilitate the collection of parish dues and to make a profit for the church from the sale of ale by the church wardens.[tpl]cite book|last= Thiselton Dyer |first=Thomas Firminger |title=Church-lore gleanings|publisher=BiblioLife, LLC |date=20 May 2009|pages=322|chapter=XXIX|isbn=1-110-16573-0|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f_35RvPeibsC&pg=PA322&lpg=PA322&dq=church-ale&ct=result#v=onepage&q=church-ale&f=false|accessdate=16 April 2010[/tpl]  These profits kept the parish church in repair, or were distributed as alms to the poor.
In the gallery of the tower arch of St Agnes, Cawston in Norfolk   is inscribed:

On the beam of a screen in the church of Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex, is the following inscription in raised blackletter on a scroll held by two angels: "This cost is the bachelers made by ales thesn be ther med."  The date is about 1480.
The feast was usually held in a barn near the church or in the churchyard.  In Tudor times church-ales were held on Sundays; gradually the parish-ales were limited to the Whitsun season, and these still have local survivals.  The colleges of the universities used to brew their own ales and hold festivals known as college-ales; some of these ales are still brewed and famous, like "chancellor" at Queen's College, and "archdeacon" at Merton College, Oxford, and "audit ale" at Trinity, Cambridge.
A short piece printed in the Manchester Times in 1870 quoted from Jefferson's Book about the Clergy:
 
 Of the Church-ale, often called the Whitsun-ale, from being generally held at Whitsuntide, it is necessary to speak at greater length, for it is a far more important institution than the bid-ale or clerk-ale. The ordinary official givers of the church-ale were two wardens who, after collecting subscriptions in money or kind from every one of their fairly well-to-do parishioners, provided a revel that not infrequently passed the wake in costliness and diversity of amusements. The board, at which everyone received a welcome who could pay for his entertainment, was loaded with good cheer; and after the feasters had eaten and drunk to contentment, if not to excess, they took part in sport on the turf of the churchyard, or on the sward of the village green. The athletes of the parish distinguished themselves in wrestling, boxing, quoit throwing; the children cheered the mummers and the morris dancers; and round a maypole decorated with ribbons, the lads and lasses plied their nimble feet to the music of the fifes, bagpipes, drums and fiddles. When they had wearied themselves by exercise, the revellers returned to the replenished board; and not seldom the feast, designed to begin and end in a day, was protracted into a demoralising debauch of a week's or even a month's duration.

Bernard Quaritch, full name Bernard Alexander Christian Quaritch, (April 23, 1819 – December 17, 1899) was a German-born British bookseller and collector.Arthur Freeman, ‘Quaritch, Bernard Alexander Christian (1819–1899)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009
He was born at Worbis, Germany. After being apprenticed to a bookseller, he went to London in 1842, and was employed by Henry Bohn, the publisher. In 1847 he started a bookseller's business off Leicester Square,[tpl]cite book |title=Hodson's Booksellers, Publishers and Stationers' Directory |year=1855 |location=London |publisher=W.H. Hodson |chapter=London |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=yiIOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA67 [/tpl] becoming naturalized as a British subject. In 1848 he started to issue a monthly Catalogue of Foreign and English Books. About 1858 he began to purchase rare books, one of the earliest of such purchases being a copy of the Mazarin Bible, and within a period of forty years he possessed six separate copies of this rare and valuable edition.
In 1860 he moved to Piccadilly. In 1873 he published the Bibliotheca Xylographica, Typographica et Palaeographica, a remarkable catalogue of early productions of the printing press of all countries. He became a regular buyer at all the principal book-sales of Europe and America, and from time to time published a variety of other catalogues of old books. Amongst these may be mentioned the Supplemental Catalogue (1877), and in 1880 an immense catalogue of considerably over 2,000 pages. The last complete catalogue of his stock was published in 1887-88 under the title General Catalogue of Old Books and Manuscripts, in seven volumes, increased with subsequent supplements to twelve. All these catalogues are of considerable bibliographical value. By this time Quaritch had developed the largest trade in old books in the world.
Among the books that he published was Edward Fitzgerald's translation of Omar Khayyám. He was also the agent for the publications of the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries. He died at Hampstead, London, leaving his business to his son. The business survives to this day.

A bier is a stand on which a corpse, coffin, or casket containing a corpse, is placed to lie in state or to be carried to the grave.The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (American Heritage Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1973), s.v., "bier"
In Christian burial, the bier is often placed in the centre of the nave with candles surrounding it, and remains in place during the funeral.
The bier is a flat frame, traditionally wooden but sometimes of other materials.  In antiquity it was often a wooden board on which the dead were placed, covered with a shroud. In modern times, the corpse is rarely carried on the bier without being first placed in a coffin or casket, though the coffin or casket is sometimes kept open.
A bier is often draped with cloth to lend dignity to the funeral service. The modern funeral industry uses a collapsible aluminium bier on wheels, known as a "church truck" to move the coffin to and from the church or funeral home for services.
Biers are generally smaller than the coffin or casket they support for reasons of appearance. As a result, they are not particularly stable, and can tip over unless well centered and undisturbed.
The Carmelite Priory at Mdina, Malta, has a colorful bier on display that was used to carry the monks or friars before they were buried without a coffin.

Malcolm X is a 1992 American biographical drama film about the African-American activist Malcolm X. Directed and co-written by Spike Lee, the film stars Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, Al Freeman, Jr., and Delroy Lindo. Lee has a supporting role as Shorty, a character based partially on real-life acquaintance Malcolm "Shorty" Jarvis, a fellow criminal and jazz trumpeter. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and future South Africa president Nelson Mandela have cameo appearances.
The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his incarceration, his conversion to Islam, his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites, and his assassination on February 21, 1965.  Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks.
Malcolm X's screenplay, co-credited to Lee and Arnold Perl, is based largely on Alex Haley's 1965 book, The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Haley collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X's death.
Malcolm X was distributed by Warner Bros. and released on November 18, 1992. Denzel Washington won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

[[Sea kayak]]
CATEGORIES: Kayaks, Water sports

A sea kayak or touring kayak is a kayak developed for the sport of paddling on open waters of lakes, bays, and the ocean. Sea kayaks are seaworthy small boats with a covered deck and the ability to incorporate a spray deck. They trade off the maneuverability of whitewater kayaks for higher cruising speed, cargo capacity, ease of straight-line paddling, and comfort for long journeys.
Sea kayaks are used around the world for marine (sea) journeys from a few hours to many weeks, as they can accommodate one to three paddlers together with room for camping gear, food, water, and other supplies. A sea kayak usually ranges anywhere from 10–18 feet (3–5½ meters) for solo craft, and up to 26 feet (8 meters) for tandem craft. Width may be as little as 21" (50 cm), and may be up to 36" (90 cm).

[[Marcionism]]

Marcionism was an Early Christian dualist belief system that originated in the teachings of Marcion of Sinope at Rome around the year 144(115 years and 6 months from the Crucifixion, according to Tertullian's reckoning in Adversus Marcionem, xv) (see also Christianity in the 2nd century).
Marcion believed Jesus Christ was the savior sent by God, and Paul of Tarsus was his chief apostle, but he rejected the Hebrew Bible and the God of Israel. Marcionists believed that the wrathful Hebrew God was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament. This belief was in some ways similar to Gnostic Christian theology; notably, both are dualistic, that is, they posit opposing gods, forces, or principles: one higher, spiritual, and "good", and the other lower, material, and "evil" (compare Manichaeism), in contrast to the orthodox Christian view that "evil" has no independent existence, but is a privation or lack of "good",St Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae Prima Pars, Q. 14 A. 10; Q. 49 A. 3.; Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, On the Divine Names, 4; iv. 31 a view shared by the Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides.Guide for the Perplexed 3,10
Marcionism, similar to Gnosticism, depicted the God of the Old Testament as a tyrant or demiurge (see also God as the Devil). Marcion was labeled a gnostic by Philip Schaff,"Marcion was the most earnest, the most practical, and the most dangerous among the Gnostics, full of energy and zeal for reforming, but restless rough and eccentric. He has a remote connection with modern questions of biblical criticism and the canon. He anticipated a rationalistic opposition to the Old Testament and to the Pastoral Epistles, but in a very arbitrary and unscrupulous way. He could see only superficial differences in the Bible, not the deeper harmony. He rejected the heathen mythology of the other Gnostics, and adhered to Christianity as the only true religion; he was less speculative, and gave a higher place to faith. But he was utterly destitute of historical sense, and put Christianity into a radical conflict with all previous revelations of God; as if God had neglected the world for thousands of years until he suddenly appeared in Christ. He represents an extreme anti-Jewish and pseudo-Pauline tendency, and a magical supranaturalism, which, in fanatical zeal for a pure primitive Christianity, nullifies all history, and turns the gospel into an abrupt, unnatural, phantomlike appearance. Marcion was the son of a bishop of Sinope in Pontus, and gave in his first fervor his property to the church, but was excommunicated by his own father, probably on account of his heretical opinions and contempt of authority..86 He betook himself, about the middle of the second century, to Rome (140–155), which originated none of the Gnostic systems, but attracted them all. There he joined the Syrian Gnostic, Cerdo." History of the Christian Church, Volume II: Ante-Nicene Christianity. A.D. 100-325. Marcion and his School by PHILIP SCHAFF http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc2.v.xiii.xvi.html while other scholars have rejected that categorization. Marcion's canon consisted of eleven books: A gospel consisting of ten sections that also appear later in the Gospel of Luke; and ten Pauline epistles. All other epistles and gospels of the 27 book New Testament canon are not yet present in Marcion's canon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc2.v.xiii.xvi.html |title=Eusebius' Church History |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl] Paul's epistles enjoy a prominent position in the Marcionite canon, since Paul is credited with correctly transmitting the universality of Jesus' message. 
Marcionism was denounced by its opponents as heresy, and written against, notably by Tertullian, in a five-book treatise Adversus Marcionem, written about 208. Marcion's writings are lost, though they were widely read and numerous manuscripts must have existed.  Even so, many scholars (including Henry Wace) claim it is possible to reconstruct and deduce a large part of ancient Marcionism through what later critics, especially Tertullian, said concerning Marcion.

[[Gunwale]]

CATEGORIES: Watercraft components

The gunwale ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ə|n|ə|l[/tpl]) is the top edge of the side of a boat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gunwale|title=gunwale|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster Incorporated|accessdate=16 July 2013[/tpl]
Originally the gunwale was the "gun ridge" on a sailing warship. This represented the strengthening wale or structural band added to the design of the ship, at and above the level of a gun deck.  It was designed to accommodate the stresses imposed by the use of artillery.
In wooden boats, the gunwale remained, mounted inboard of the sheer strake, regardless of the use of gunnery. In modern boats, it is the top edge of the side where there is usually some form of stiffening.
On a canoe, the gunwale is typically the widened edge at the top of the side of the boat, where the edge is reinforced with wood, plastic or aluminum and to which the thwarts are attached.  Modern cedar-strip canoes have gunwales which consist of an inner and outer parts called "inwales" and "outwales". These two parts of the gunwale give rigidity and strength to the hull. The inwale will often have "scuppers" or slots cut into the inwale to allow water to drain when the canoe hull is turned upside down for storing.
On a rowing boat (especially in sports), the gunwale is sometimes referred to as the saxboard.
On a narrowboat or canal boat, the gunwale is synonymous with the side deck - a narrow ledge running the full length of the sides of the boat allowing a person to (cautiously) walk along the side of the cabin, generally with the aid of a handrail mounted on the roof.

Stanley Tookie Williams III (December 29, 1953  – December 13, 2005) was a leader of the Crips, a violent American street gang which has its roots in South Central Los Angeles in 1969. Once incarcerated, he authored several books, including anti-gang and anti-violence literature and children's books.
Williams refused to help police investigate his gang, and was implicated in attacks on  guards and women, as well as multiple escape plots. In 1993, Williams began making changes in his behavior, and became an anti-gang activist while on Death Row in California. He renounced his gang affiliation and apologized for his role in founding the Crips, although he still refused to help police investigate the gang. He also co-wrote children's books and participated in efforts intended to prevent youths from joining gangs.Paul Van Slambrouck, "On Death Row, an Author and Nobel Nominee," Christian Science Monitor (28 November 2000) p. 1. A biographical TV-movie entitled Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story, featuring Jamie Foxx as Williams, was made in 2004.
On December 13, 2005, Williams was executed by lethal injection after clemency and a four-week stay of execution were both rejected by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, amid debate over the death penalty. Williams was the second inmate in California to be executed in 2005.

Washington is believed to have initially formed the Baby Avenues street gang, which became the Avenue Cribs before the name evolved into the Crips, because he wanted to form a gang that could protect their territory in South Central and prevent criminal and more violent gangs outside the territory.
He disliked firearms and knives, and believed that fist fighting and hand-to-hand combat was the most effective way to resolve differences. By the time of his death, however, his influence on the gang had diminished and firearms had become widely used. Washington was murdered in South Central Los Angeles on August 9, 1979, and the murder has remained unsolved.

Legio prima ''Parthica'' (Latin for "First Parthian legion") was a Roman legion levied in 197 by the emperor Septimius Severus. The legion presence in the Middle East is recorded until the early 5th century.
The legions I, II, and III Parthica were levied by Septimius Severus for his campaign against Parthian Empire. After the success this campaign, I and III Parthica remained in the region, in the camp of Singara (Sinjar, Iraq), in Mesopotamia, to avoid following rebellions and attacks from the Parthian Empire.
Legionaries from I Parthica were usually sent to other provinces, namely Lycia, Cilicia and Cyrenaica.
In 360, I Parthica unsuccessfully defended its camp against a Sassanid attack; after the defeat, the legion was moved to Nisibis (modern Turkey), where it remained until the city was surrendered to the Sassanid Persians in 363. After that, the legion was moved to Constantina, where it is last mentioned in the 5th century.
The legion emblem was the centaur.

[[Silphium]]

CATEGORIES: Abortifacients, Spices, Extinct plants, Holocene extinctions, Medicinal plants

Silphium (also known as silphion, laserwort, or laser) was a plant that was used in classical antiquity as a rich seasoning and as a medicine. It was the essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore a picture of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin (laser, laserpicium, or lasarpicium).
Silphium was an important species in prehistory, as evidenced by the Egyptians and Knossos Minoans developing a specific glyph to represent the silphium plant.[tpl]cite web |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes |title=Knossos fieldnotes |work=Modern Antiquarian |year=2007 |accessdate=13 Feb 2009[/tpl] It was used widely by most ancient Mediterranean cultures; the Romans considered it "worth its weight in denarii" (silver coins).  Legend said that it was a gift from the god Apollo.
The exact identity of silphium is unclear. It is commonly believed to be a now-extinct plant of the genus Ferula,J.L. Tatman, "Silphium, Silver and Strife: A History of Kyrenaika and Its Coinage" Celator 14.10 (October 2000:6–24). perhaps a variety of "giant fennel". The still-extant plant  Ferula tingitana has been suggested as another possibility.Did the ancient Romans use a natural herb for birth control?,  Straight Dope,  13 October 2006  Another plant, asafoetida, was used as a cheaper substitute for silphium, and had similar enough qualities that Romans, including the geographer Strabo, used the same word to describe both.Dalby, page 18.

[[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix]]

CATEGORIES: Roman legions, 105 establishments, Military units and formations established in the 2nd century

Legio trigesima ''Ulpia Victrix (Latin for "Thirtieth Victorious Ulpian legion") was a Roman legion levied by the Emperor Trajan in 100 for the Dacian Wars. The legion was active until disbandment of the Rhine frontier in the beginning of the 5th century. Their emblems were the gods Neptune and Jupiter and the Capricorn. Ulpia is Trajan's own gens (Ulpia), while the cognomen "Victrix''" means "victorious", and was awarded after the valliant behaviour in the Dacian wars.
The legion's first base camp was in the province of Dacia in the Danube fronier, although it's likely that at least some of its legionaries took part in the Parthian campaigns of Trajan. In 122 they were moved to Colonia Ulpia Traiana (modern Xanten) in Germania Inferior, where they remained for the following centuries. Their main tasks were public construction and police affairs.
In the 2nd century and the beginning of the 3rd century, units of the XXX Ulpia Victrix were allocated in Parthia, as well as Gaul, Mauretania and other Roman provinces, due to the peaceful situation in Germania Inferior.
In the civil war of 193, XXX Ulpia Victrix supported Septimius Severus, who granted them the title of Pia Fidelis ("faithful and loyal").

Bob Cowley Riley (September 18, 1924 – February 16, 1994) was an American educator and politician who served as  Governor of Arkansas for 11 days in 1975. He had previously been a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1946 to 1950, the mayor of Arkadelphia, Arkansas, in 1966 and 1967, and the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas from 1971 to 1975. Riley wore a black eyepatch because of an injury sustained in World War II.
Riley was born in Little Rock, the son of Columbus Allen Riley and the former Winnie Mae Craig. He attended public schools in Little Rock. He dropped out of high school after Pearl Harbor to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. On July 24, 1944, Riley, based in Guam, led a rifle squad assault against a Japanese machine gun emplacement. The attack nearly cost Riley his life. His severe wounds kept him hospitalized for more than a year. Not only was his vision impaired, his limbs were battered, and he was in pain thereafter. His left eye was removed, and although he had some perception of light in his right eye for a time, it quickly faded and he became completely blind.[tpl]cite news |title=First Legally Blind Governor?

After World War II service, Riley graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in 1950 and 1951, respectively. 
Riley served as a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from Pulaski County (Little Rock) from 1946 to 1950 even though he was in Washington County at the university for the majority of the time during his legislative tenure. In 1950, he failed in a bid for the Arkansas State Senate. For a while, he was an insurance salesman.
Riley taught at Little Rock University from 1951 to 1955, and received his doctorate in education from the University of Arkansas in 1957.
He then took a post at Ouachita Baptist University at Arkadelphia in Clark County. He became the longtime chairman of the political science department and also taught history and economics. His OBU colleagues were Jim McDougal and Jim Ranchino, both advocates of Bill Clinton's beginning political career. Riley served on the Arkadelphia City Council from 1960 to 1966 and as mayor in 1966 and 1967.
He served as Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas from 1971 to 1975.  In 1970, as the running mate of Dale Leon Bumpers, Riley defeated Republican candidate, Sterling R. Cockrill of Little Rock, the ticket-mate of Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, whom Bumpers crushed in the general election. Riley defeated Cockrill, 334,379 (56.5 percent) to Cockrill's 232,429 (39.3 percent). The remaining 4.2 percent went to Hubert Blanton of Hughes in St. Francis County in eastern Arkansas, nominee of the American Independent Party. Riley won sixty-six of the seventy-five counties.
In 1972, again on the Bumpers gubernatorial slate, Riley defeated the Republican Ken Coon, then of Fort Smith, the seat of Sebastian County. Riley topped Coon, 392,869 (62.8 percent) to 233,090 (37.2 percent) and won majorities in seventy-two counties.
In 1974, Riley was an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate. He and former Governor Orval Faubus were defeated in the Democratic primary by former U.S. Representative David Pryor of Camden. Pryor went on to defeat Coon, Riley's former opponent for lieutenant governor, in the 1974 general election.
Riley became  Governor of Arkansas in 1975 to serve the final days of the unexpired term of then Governor Dale Bumpers. Bumpers had been elected to the United State Senate and his Senate term began before his term as governor expired. Riley served as  Governor for eleven days. 
He taught at OBU until 1980, when health problems forced his premature retirement. He died of congestive heart failure. Riley and his wife, the former Claudia Zimmerman, were the parents of one daughter, Megan (born 1959).
Riley is interred in Rest Haven Memorial Gardens in Arkadelphia.

Joe Edward Purcell (July 29, 1923 – March 5, 1987) was the Governor of Arkansas for six days in 1979 as well as Arkansas Attorney General from 1967–1971 and the ninth Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas from 1975–1981.
Purcell was born in Warren, the seat of Bradley County, in southern Arkansas. He graduated from Little Rock Junior College and the  University of Arkansas School of Law at Fayetteville. From 1962 to 1967, he served as the municipal judge in Benton in Saline County. He also served as prosecuting attorney in Benton prior to having been elected judge.
In 1966, Purcell unseated Attorney Geneal Bruce Bennett, a strong segregationist from El Dorado in the Democratic primary election. He then defeated in the general election a stronger-than-usual opponent, Republican Jerry Thomasson, a former Democrat and a state representative from Arkadelphia in Clark County.
In 1974, Purcell was elected lieutenant governor; he handily defeated the Republican Leona Troxell of Rose Bud in White County,  a former associate of the late Governor Winthrop Rockefeller. He was reelected as lieutenant governor in 1976 and 1978 under Governors David Pryor and Bill Clinton. He served as  Governor for six days in 1979, having filled the unexpired term of then senator-elect David Hampton Pryor of Camden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theus50.com/arkansas/governors.php|title=State of Arkansas: Governors|publisher=theus50.com|accessdate=June 26, 2010|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Purcell was twice a candidate for governor. In 1970, he was considered the leading challenger to former Governor Orval Faubus and ran second to Faubus throughout the primary race, but was edged out of a runoff berth by less than 500 votes by Charleston attorney Dale Bumpers, who went on to defeat Faubus and then the Republican Governor Winthrop Rockefeller in the general election. Purcell was Bumpers' choice to chair the Arkansas Democratic Party, a position which he held from 1970 to 1973. His chief task as party chair was to purge followers of presidential candidate George Wallace of Alabama and former gubernatorial nominee James D. Johnson from the party ranks and to limit the influence of the Faubus-era "Old Guard" faction. He entered the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1982 and surpisingly edged out former Congressman Jim Guy Tucker for a runoff berth with former Governor Bill Clinton. Purcell lost the Democratic nomination in a runoff primary to Clinton, 46 to 54 percent.http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ekZlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rJMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1691,3593382&dq=joe+purcell+arkansas&hl=en

The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, usually called the AP Stylebook, is a style and usage guide used by newspapers and in the news industry in the United States. The book is updated annually by Associated Press editors, usually in June. 
Reporters, editors and others use the AP Stylebook as a guide for grammar, punctuation and principles and practices of reporting. Although some publications use a different style guide, the AP Stylebook is considered a newspaper industry standard and is also used by broadcasters, magazines and public relations firms, in part because its style guidelines offer short-form advantages over other  style manuals designed to save scarce print space, such as dropping the Oxford comma and using figures for all numbers above nine.Lamb, David. "Understanding 'Style'". Retrieved 2 September 2013. It includes an A-to-Z listing of guides to capitalization, abbreviation, spelling, numerals and usage.
Example: If the title of governor is used before a name, it should be capitalized and abbreviated e.g. Gov. Janet Napolitano, but when it's used generically by itself or after the name it should be lowercase and not abbreviated.

Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst Paulus (23 September 1890 – 1 February 1957) was an officer in the German military from 1910 to 1945. He attained the rank of Generalfeldmarschall (field marshal) during World War II, and is best known for commanding the Sixth Army in the Battle of Stalingrad, including the successful advance toward the city and the less successful attack in 1942 (Case Blue) stopped by the Soviet counter-offensives during the 1942-43 winter. The battle ended in disaster for Nazi Germany when about 265,000 personnel of the Wehrmacht, their Axis allies, and the anti-Soviet volunteers were encircled and defeated. Of the 107,000 captured, only 6,000 survived captivity and returned home by 1955.
Paulus surrendered to Soviet forces in Stalingrad on 31 January 1943, the day after he was promoted to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall by Adolf Hitler. Hitler expected Paulus to commit suicide, citing the fact that there was no record of a German field marshal ever being captured alive. While in Soviet captivity during the war, Paulus became a vocal critic of the Nazi regime and joined the Soviet-sponsored National Committee for a Free Germany. He moved to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1953.

Kumaragupta I (Mahendraditya)  was a ruler of the Gupta Empire in 415–455 CE. Like his father and predecessor, Chandragupta II, Kumaragupta was an able ruler. He retained, intact, the vast empire, which extended from Bengal to Kathiawar and from the Himalayas to the Narmada. He ruled efficiently for nearly forty years. However, the last days of his reign were not good. The Gupta Empire was threatened by the rebellion of Pushyamitras of central India and invasion of the White Huns. However, Kumaragupta was successful in defeating both threats and performed Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) to celebrate his victory. He issued new coins with images of Lord Kartikeya.

[[Taste bud]]

CATEGORIES: Gustatory system, Tongue

Taste buds contain the receptors for taste. They are located around the small structures on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus and epiglottis, which are called papillae.Discovery News, October 26, 2010 These structures are involved in detecting the five (known) elements of taste perception: salty, sour, bitter, sweet, and umami. A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves.
On average, the human tongue has 3,000–10,000 taste buds.Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.

Sidney Sanders McMath (June 14, 1912[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]October 4, 2003) was a decorated U.S. Marine, attorney and the 34th Governor of Arkansas (1949–1953) who, in defiance of his state's political establishment, championed rapid rural electrification, massive highway and school construction, the building of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, strict bank and utility regulation, repeal of the poll tax, open and honest elections and broad expansion of opportunity for black citizens in the decade following World War II.
McMath remained loyal to President Harry S Truman during the "Dixiecrat" rebellion of 1948, campaigning throughout the South for Truman's re-election. As a former governor, McMath led the opposition to segregationist Governor Orval Faubus following the 1957 Little Rock school crisis. He later became one of the nation's foremost trial lawyers, representing thousands of injured persons in precedent-setting cases and mentoring several generations of young attorneys.

Connie Douglas Reeves (September 26, 1901 – August 16, 2003) was the oldest member of the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, and one of the first women to study law at a Texas law school.
Reeves was born in Eagle Pass, Texas. She received her undergraduate degree in speech from Texas Woman's University. She enrolled in the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, but the economic conditions of the Great Depression forced her to withdraw and seek work to help her family. Reeves taught high school in San Antonio and worked part-time as a riding instructor at a local stable. She had always been around horses, and was quoted as saying that she sat on a horse before she could sit up by herself. In 1936, she joined the equestrian program at Camp Waldemar in Hunt. It is estimated that she taught 30,000 girls how to ride at the camp.Sullivan, Caitlin. "A Saddle Story," Texas Highways Nov. 2008 p11.
Reeves met her husband Jack at the camp and the couple married in 1942. They managed a [tpl]convert|10000|acre|km2|sigfig=2[/tpl] sheep and cattle ranch for more than forty years when camp was not in session. Jack Reeves died in 1985. 
She was elected to the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1997, and rode in the parade to honor the Hall when it moved to new headquarters in Fort Worth in 2002. She was over 100 years old at the time."Connie Douglas Reeves," National Cowgirl Museum & Hall of Fame. Retrieved Nov. 2, 2008
In 2003, Reeves died from injuries suffered when she was thrown from her horse. She had been injured several times in the last few years of her life, including having been kicked by the same horse, resulting in a fractured thigh.Duryea, Bill. "A cowgirl's final ride," St. Petersburg Times. Retrieved Nov. 2, 2008. 
Her autobiography, I Married a Cowboy: Half Century with Girls & Horses at Camp Waldemar, was published in 1995. Her motto was, "Always saddle your own horse."

The Pan-American Highway passes through many diverse climates and ecological types, from dense jungles, to arid deserts, are passable only during the dry season, and in many regions driving is occasionally hazardous.
Jake Silverstein, writing in 2006, described the Pan-American Highway as "a system so vast, so incomplete, and so incomprehensible it is not so much a road as it is the idea of Pan-Americanism itself".[tpl]cite journal|authorlink = Jake Silverstein|title = Highway Run|journal = Harper's|pages = 70–80|date = July 2006[/tpl]

The 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, a suspension bridge in the U.S. state of Washington that spanned the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. It opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically collapsed into Puget Sound on November 7 of the same year. At the time of its construction (and its destruction), the bridge was the third longest suspension bridge in the world in terms of main span length, behind the Golden Gate Bridge and the George Washington Bridge.
Construction on the bridge began in September 1938. From the time the deck was built, it began to move vertically in windy conditions, which led to construction workers giving the bridge the nickname Galloping Gertie. The motion was observed even when the bridge opened to the public. Several measures aimed at stopping the motion were ineffective, and the bridge's main span finally collapsed under [tpl]convert|40|mph|km/h|adj=on[/tpl] wind conditions the morning of November 7, 1940.
Following the collapse, the United States' involvement in World War II delayed plans to replace the bridge. The portions of the bridge still standing after the collapse, including the towers and cables, were dismantled and sold as scrap metal. Nearly 10 years after the bridge collapsed, a new Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened in the same location, using the original bridge's tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The portion of the bridge that fell into the water now serves as an artificial reef.
The bridge's collapse had a lasting effect on science and engineering.  In many physics textbooks, the event is presented as an example of elementary forced resonance with the wind providing an external periodic frequency that matched the bridge's natural structural frequency, though the actual cause of failure was aeroelastic flutter. Its failure also boosted research in the field of bridge aerodynamics-aeroelastics, the study of which has influenced the designs of all the world's great long-span bridges built since 1940.

Benjamin Travis Laney, Jr. (25 November 1896[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]21 January 1977), was the 33rd Governor of Arkansas, having served from 1945-1949.
Laney was born in Camden, where he attended Ouachita County public schools but never graduated from high school. He was, however, admitted in 1915 to Hendrix College, a liberal arts institution in Conway.
His studies were interrupted by World War I. Laney entered the United States Navy in 1918 and served until the end of the war.
In 1924, Laney earned a degree from the University of Central Arkansas (then known as Arkansas Teacher's College), also in Conway. He also took graduate courses from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Laney owned a drugstore in Conway, dealt in real estate, and had interests in cotton gins, feed, and banking. Oil was discovered on Laney's farm near Camden. He was hence called "Business Ben" because of his varied business interests.
Laney was elected mayor of Camden in 1935 and served until 1939.  In 1944, he successfully ran for governor. In the Democratic primary, Laney polled 70,965 votes (38.6 percent), compared to J. Bryan Sims's 63,454 (34.5 percent), and former U.S. Representative David D. Terry's 49,685 (27 percent). Sims declined to pursue a party runoff election, and Laney was declared the Democratic nominee. He then overwhelmed the Republican nominee, Harley C. Stump of Stuttgart, 186,401 (86 percent) to 30,422 (14 percent). Stump had also run unsuccessfully in 1940 against Carl E. Bailey.
During the Laney administration, the Public Utilities Commission was formed and funds were appropriated for a stadium to be built in Little Rock. Plans were also formed for the construction of an official Governor's Mansion. Laney successfully ran for reelection in 1946. He defeated J. M. Malone in the primary, having polled 125,444 votes, or 64.6 percent of the total. Laney then overwhelmed the Republican W. T. Mills, 128,029 (84.1 percent) to 24,133 (15.9 percent) in the gubernatorial general election. Three Republicans gained seats in the Arkansas House of Representatives, having represented Madison, Newton, and Seardcy counties.
Laney sat out a gubernatorial term and unsuccessfully attempted to regain office in 1950, but he failed to unseat the more liberal Democratic incumbent, Sidney Sanders McMath. McMath received 298,559 votes (64 percent) to Laney's 112,651 (34.4 percent). Despite having previously served two terms, Laney campaigned against McMath under the slogan, "Re-Elect Ben Laney Governor, For a Second Time." After defeating Laney, McMath then trounced the Republican nominee, the young planter Jefferson W. Speck of Frenchmans Bayou in Mississippi County.
In 1948, Laney was a top choice to serve as the Dixiecrat presidential nominee. At first, he balked and told reporters he would not attend the breakaway convention. However, he changed his mind and made the trip to Birmingham, Alabama. Then he hesitated again and remained in his hotel room. He did not attend the convention and formally withdrew his name from consideration before the nomination was made. The nomination ultimately fell to Strom Thurmond, then the governor of South Carolina.
Laney was a delegate to the 1969 Arkansas Constitutional Convention.
Laney died of a heart attack in Magnolia, the seat of Columbia County south of Camden. He is interred at Camden Memorial Cemetery in Camden,[tpl]cite web|title=Benjamin Travis Laney|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=19650|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl]  alongside his wife, the former Lucille Kirtley (1906–1992). Son Benjamin Laney, III (1928–1995), is entombed at Desert View Memorial Park in Victorville, California, as explained in a cenotaph at the Laney family plot in Camden. Another son, William David Laney (1931–1997), is interred in the family plot in Camden.

Homer Martin Adkins (October 15, 1890 – February 26, 1964) was the 32nd governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas. He was born near Jacksonville in Pulaski County. In 1908, he attended Draughon's Business College and graduated from the Little Rock College of Pharmacy in 1911 as a licensed pharmacist.
Adkins served in the United States Army during World War I as a captain in the Medical Corps. Adkins served one term as sheriff of Pulaski County and was the collector of internal revenue from 1933 to 1940, when he was first elected as governor. In the 1940 general election, Adkins defeated the Republican Harley C. Stump, the mayor of Stuttgart and a leader of the Arkansas Municipal League, 91.8 to 8.2 percent. In that campaign Stump claimed the employees of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration were underpaid. Adkins was unopposed in the 1942 general election for his second term.
Adkins sought to build a voting base based on his background as a Methodist Sunday school teacher and church employee. He campaigned on a platform of reform and ending the practice of bootlegging.
The Adkins administration presided over a doubling of the surplus in the state's treasury.  His administration focused on highway construction and financing, electrification, and worker's compensation. 
In his second term Adkins signed into law a bill that would prevent anyone of Japanese descent from owning land in Arkansas. Looking for a new challenge, he was defeated in 1944 in a bid for the U.S. Senate. He opposed Senator Hattie Caraway and the freshman U.S. Representative J. William Fulbright of Fayetteville.  Mrs. Caraway finished third, with Fulbright later winning the Democratic runoff against Adkins. Fulbright then claimned the Senate seat when he defeated the Republican Victor Wade of Batesville, 85.1 to 14.9 percent.
In 1948, Adkins was appointed administrator of the Arkansas Employment Security Division, the agency responsible for worker's unemployment insurance.
In 1954, Adkins strongly supported the Democrat Orval Faubus in the gubernatorial general election against Pratt C. Remmel, the Republican mayor of Little Rock.
In 1956, he established a public relations firm in Little Rock.
Adkins died in 1964 in Malvern, Arkansas. He is interred at the Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Little Rock.[tpl]cite web|title=Homer Martin Adkins|url=http://www.findagrave.com/php/famous.php?page=gSearch&page=gSearch&globalSearchCriteria=Homer+Martin+Adkins|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl] 
On the edge of his hometown of Jacksonville, a neighborhood elementary school today is named for Adkins.  The school is slated to convert to a pre-kindergarten format beginning in the 2006-2007 school year.

The Pan-American Highway route in North America is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000 km in length which travels through the mainland nations of the Americas.
No definitive length of the Pan American Highway exists because the Canadian government has never officially defined any specific route as being part of the Pan-American Highway, while in the U.S., the Federal Highway Administration(FHA) has designated the entire Interstate Highway System part of the Pan-American Highway System, although this has not yet been reinforced by any official highway signage.American Automobile Association, American Motorist, ca. 1974New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, State of New Mexico Memorial Designations and Dedications of Highways, Structures and Buildings, 2007, p. 14 Mexico officially has many branches connecting to various interstate highways at the U.S. border.

CATEGORIES: Cryptographic hardware, Encryption devices, World War II military equipment of Germany, Signals intelligence of World War II, Broken stream ciphers

The Lorenz SZ40, SZ42A and SZ42B were German rotor stream cipher machines used by the German Army during World War II. They were developed by C. Lorenz AG in Berlin and the model name SZ was derived from Schlüsselzusatz, meaning cipher attachment. The instruments implemented a Vernam stream cipher. 
British cryptographers, who referred to encrypted German teleprinter traffic as Fish, dubbed the machine and its traffic Tunny.[tpl]Harvnb|Hinsley|1993|p=141[/tpl]
The SZ machines were in-line attachments to standard Lorenz teleprinters. An experimental link using SZ40 machines was started in June 1941. The enhanced SZ42 machines were brought into substantial use from mid-1942 onwards for high-level communications between the German High Command in Berlin, and Army Commands throughout occupied Europe.[tpl]Harvnb|Hinsley|1993|p=142[/tpl] The more advanced SZ42A came into routine use in February 1943 and the SZ42B in June 1944.[tpl]Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=38, 39[/tpl]
Wireless telegraphy (WT) rather than land-line circuits was used for this traffic.[tpl]Harvnb|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|p=4[/tpl] of German Tunny These non-Morse (NoMo) messages were picked up by Britain's Y-stations at Knockholt and Denmark Hill and sent to Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (BP).

[[1941 in Afghanistan]]

Under its enlightened monarch Zahir Shah the country is advancing steadily in education and in the industries which are expected to exercise a civilizing influence on its turbulent people. But endeavours to stir up trouble are not lacking. The ex-emir Amanullah is hanging on to the other side of the frontier and is believed to be under Nazi orders to foment disaffection. The faqir of Ipi, an old campaigner among the tribes, is also intriguing. The king, however, is most correct in his neutrality, and his handling of the German colony in the country in the closing months of the year gives proof of his sincerity. German nationals organized themselves as a foreign branch of the Nazi party, and were developing active pro-Hitler propaganda on the approved fifth-column lines. Their position was one of some strength; they were employed as experts in economic development and in education, as engineers and as suppliers of machinery and plant for industrial enterprises. On British representations, however, the government orders the deportation of all German and Italian nationals; and a considerable danger to British India is thus averted. During the year, Sir Francis Verner Wylie succeeds Sir William Fraser-Tytler as British minister at Kabul.

[[VIC cipher]]
CATEGORIES: Classical ciphers, Science and technology in the Soviet Union

The VIC cipher was a pencil and paper cipher used by the  Soviet spy Reino Häyhänen, codenamed "VICTOR".
If the cipher were to be given a modern technical name, it would be known as a "straddling bipartite monoalphabetic substitution superenciphered by modified double transposition." However, by general classification it is part of the Nihilist family of ciphers.
It was arguably the most complex hand-operated cipher ever seen, when it was first discovered. The initial analysis done by the NSA in 1953 did not absolutely conclude that it was a hand cipher, but its placement in a hollowed out 5c coin implied it could be broken by pencil and paper. The VIC cipher remained unbroken until more information about its structure was available. 
Although certainly not as complex or secure as modern computer operated stream ciphers or block ciphers, in practice messages protected by it resisted all attempts at cryptanalysis by at least NSA from its discovery in 1953 until Häyhänen's defection in 1957.

The basic concept behind People's War is to maintain the support of the population and draw the enemy deep into the interior where the population will bleed them dry through a mix of Mobile Warfare and guerrilla warfare. It was used by the Communists against the Nationalist Government in the Chinese Civil War.
The term is used by Maoists for their strategy of long-term armed revolutionary struggle. After the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, Deng Xiaoping abandoned People's War for "People's War under Modern Conditions," which moved away from reliance on troops over technology. With the adoption of "socialism with Chinese characteristics", economic reforms fueled military and technological investment. Troop numbers were also reduced and professionalisation encouraged.
The strategy of people's war was used heavily by the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. However protracted war should not be confused with the "foco" theory employed by Che Guevara and Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution of 1959.

The region is located in the Central area of the country, bordered by Emilia-Romagna and the republic of San Marino to the north, Tuscany to the north-west, Umbria to the west, Abruzzo and Lazio to the south and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Except for river valleys and the often very narrow coastal strip, the land is hilly. A railway from Bologna to Brindisi, built in the 19th century, runs along the coast of the entire territory. Inland, the mountainous nature of the region, even today, allows relatively little travel north and south, except by twisting roads over the passes.

It is bordered by Rhône-Alpes, France to the west, Valais, Switzerland to the north and the region of Piedmont to the south and east.
With an area of [tpl]convert|3263|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] and a population of about 126,933, it is the smallest, least populous, and least densely populated region of Italy. It is the only Italian region which has no provinces (the province of Aosta was dissolved in 1945). Provincial administrative functions are provided by the regional government.http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg13/lavori/bollet/200007/0718/pdf/06.pdf The region is divided into 74 comuni (communes).
Italian and French are both official, though the native population speaks also Valdôtain, a form of Franco-Provençal (Arpitan), as home language.

[[Engine tuning]]
CATEGORIES: Engine technology

Engine tuning is the adjustment, modification of the internal combustion engine or modification to its control unit, otherwise known as its ECU (Engine Control Unit). It is performed to yield optimal performance, to increase an engine's power output, economy, or durability. These goals may be mutually exclusive, and an engine may be detuned with respect to output (work) in exchange for better economy or longer engine life due to lessened stress on engine components.
It has a long history, almost as long as the development of the automobile in general, originating with the development of early racing cars, and later, with the post-war hot-rod movement. Tuning can describe a wide variety of adjustments and modifications, from the routine adjustment of the carburetor and ignition system to significant engine overhauls. At the other end of the scale, performance tuning of an engine can involve revisiting some of the design decisions taken at quite an early stage in the development of the engine.
Setting the idle speed, fuel/air mixture, carburetor balance, spark plug and distributor point gaps, and ignition timing were regular maintenance items for all older engines and the final but essential steps in setting up a racing engine. On modern engines, equipped with electronic ignition and fuel injection, some or all of these tasks are automated, although they still require periodic calibration.

JET Programme participants are collectively called JETs.
Participants currently come from a total of 40 countries.

The majority of CIRs on the programme come from the United States (102), China (78), and Korea. Holders of Japanese passports may participate in the programme, but must renounce their Japanese citizenship to do so. The focus of the program is on English language learning and teaching, so about 90% of the participants on the programme are ALTs; the remaining 10% are divided between CIRs and SEAs. The number of alumni totals over 57,000 from 54 different countries.[tpl]cite web|title=JET Programme History|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/introduction/history.html|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl]

Kill Bill: Volume 1 is a 2003 American action/thrillercomedy-drama film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is the first of two films that were theatrically released several months apart, the second one titled Kill Bill Volume 2.
Kill Bill was originally scheduled for a single theatrical release,[tpl]cite journal |last=Snyder|first=Gabriel|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117889372|title=Double 'Kill' bill|journal=Variety|date=2003-07-15[/tpl] but with a running time of over four hours, it was separated into two volumes. Kill Bill: Volume 1 was released in late 2003, and Kill Bill: Volume 2 was released in early 2004. The two films are frequently referred to collectively as simply "Kill Bill."
They follow a character initially identified as "The Bride", a former member of an assassination team who seeks revenge on her ex-colleagues who massacred members of her wedding party and tried to kill her. The movie is often noted for its stylish direction and its homages to film genres such as Hong Kong martial arts films, Japanese chanbara films, anime, Italian spaghetti westerns, girls with guns, and rape and revenge.

The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is a nonfiction book by Tom Wolfe that was published in 1968.  The book is remembered today as an early – and arguably the most popular – example of the growing literary style called New Journalism. Wolfe presents an as-if-firsthand account of the experiences of Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters, who traveled across the country in a colorfully painted school bus named "Furthur".  Kesey and the Pranksters became famous for their use of LSD and other psychedelic drugs in hopes of achieving intersubjectivity. The book chronicles the Acid Tests (parties in which LSD-laced Kool-Aid was used to obtain a communal trip), the group's encounters with (in)famous figures of the time, including famous authors, Hells Angels, and The Grateful Dead, and it also describes Kesey's exile to Mexico and his arrests.

[[Assistant Language Teacher]]
CATEGORIES: Foreign educators in Japan, Education and training occupations, Language education, English-language education

An Assistant Language Teacher (ALT) is a foreign national serving as an assistant teacher (paraprofessional educator) in a Japanese classroom, particularly for English.
The term was created by the Japanese Ministry of Education at the time of the creation of the JET Programme as a translation of the term 外国語指導助手 (gaikokugo shidō joshu) or literally "foreign language instruction assistant". The terms AET (Assistant English Teacher), ELT (English Language Teacher) and NESA (Native English Speaking Assistant) are also in use. The term is used by the Ministry of Education, local Boards of Education (BOEs) and schools in Japan primarily to refer to English language speakers who assist with teaching of English in elementary, junior high and high schools. However, some ALTs help teach languages other than English.
ALTs are required to be college graduates, but they are usually not certified teachers like their Japanese colleagues.  Very few ALTs have taken advantage of policy changes made in 2001 that allow highly qualified ALTs to obtain Japanese teaching licenses.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]

The center may break open and form an ulcer. This initial skin lesion typically heals after three to six months. After weeks to years, joints and bones may become painful fatigue and new skin lesions may appear. The skin of the palms of the hands and bottom of the feet may become thick and break open. The bones (including the nose) may become misshapen. After more than five years large areas of skin death with subsequent scarring may occur.
Yaws is spread by direct contact with the fluid from a lesion of an infected person. The contact is usually of a non-sexual nature. The disease is most common among children where it is spread by playing together. Other related treponemal diseases are bejel (Treponema pallidum endemicum), pinta (Treponema pallidum carateum), and syphilis (Treponema pallidum pallidum). Yaws is often diagnosed by the appearance of the lesions. Blood antibody tests may be useful but cannot separate previous from current infections. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most accurate method of diagnosis.
Prevention is, in part, by curing those who have the disease thereby decreasing the risk of transmission. Where the disease is common, treating the entire community is effective. Improving cleanliness and sanitation will also decrease spread. Treatment is typically with antibiotics including: azithromycin by mouth or benzathine penicillin by injection. If there is no treatment physical deformities occurs in 10%.
Yaws is common in at least 14 tropical countries as of 2012. The disease only infects humans.[tpl]cite web|title=Yaws  Fact sheet N°316|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs316/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=27 February 2014|date=February 2014[/tpl] In the 1950s and 1960s the World Health Organization (WHO) nearly got rid of the disease. Since then the number of cases has increased and WHO is again trying get rid of the disease by 2020. The last estimate of the number of people infected was more than 500,000 in 1995. One of the first description of the disease was in 1679 by Willem Piso with some archaeological evidence finding the disease among humans as far back as 1.6 million years ago.

The Teen Titans, also known as the New Teen Titans and Titans, is a comic book superhero team who appear in comic books published by DC Comics, often in an eponymous monthly series. As the group's name suggests, its members are teenage superheroes. The theme of teenagers learning to take on adult roles and responsibilities was common throughout the series.
The team unofficially debuted in The Brave and the Bold #54 (1964) as a "junior Justice League" featuring Dick Grayson, Kid Flash (Wally West) and Aqualad, the sidekicks of Justice League members Batman, the Flash and Aquaman respectively. The group made its first official appearance under the name of "Teen Titans" in The Brave and the Bold #60, joined by Wonder Girl (Donna Troy), Wonder Woman's younger sister.Wonder Girl refers to Wonder Woman's mother, Queen Hippolyta, as "Mother" in her first two appearances, The Brave and the Bold #60 and Showcase #59. Later, Green Arrow's sidekick, Speedy (Roy Harper) replaced Aqualad.
After only modest initial success, the series became a hit in a 1980s revival[tpl]Cite journal | last=MacDonald | first=Heidi D. | title=DC's Titanic Success | journal=The Comics Journal | issue=76 | date=October 1982 | pages=46–51[/tpl][tpl]cite book|quote=Wolfman and George Pérez created a title that would be DC's sales leader throughout the 1980s.|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= Taschen America |year=2010| ISBN= 978-3-8365-1981-6|page= 454[/tpl] under writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez. In 1980, the team relaunched as The New Teen Titans, aging the characters to young adulthood. Original members Robin, Wonder Girl and Kid Flash were joined by new characters Cyborg, Starfire and Raven, as well as the former Doom Patrol member Beast Boy, as Changeling. The group had several encounters with the original Titans of Greek mythology, particularly Hyperion. The series was re-titled Tales of the Teen Titans with issue #41 (April 1984). A second volume was launched in August 1984. Pérez left in 1985 to headline the DC Comics 50th Anniversary limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. Tales of the Teen Titans was canceled in July 1988 after #91. The New Teen Titans Volume 2 was retitled The New Titans in December 1988 (issue #50) and was ultimately canceled in February 1996 after 130 issues.
The series was relaunched as Teen Titans in October 1996, with all-new members under Atom (Ray Palmer), who had been de-aged to a teenager. This series ended in September 1998 after 24 issues. A three-issue limited series titled JLA/The Titans: The Technis Imperative (December 1998 – February 1999) led to the March 1999 debut of The Titans, a series featuring select Titans from across the group's incarnations that produced 50 issues until April 2003. A new regular series titled Teen Titans began in September 2003, featuring Cyborg, Starfire, Beast Boy and Raven of the 1980s group joined by new teenaged versions of Robin (Tim Drake), Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark) and Kid Flash (Bart Allen), as well as the Superman clone Superboy (Kon-El). By 2006, the team included only the younger members and some new additions. A concurrent series titled Titans debuted in April 2008 featuring some of the original and 1980s members, such as Nightwing, Troia, Flash (Wally West), Tempest, Arsenal, Cyborg, Beast Boy and Raven.
In September 2011, the franchise rebooted again as part of DC's The New 52 event with a new team consisting of Red Robin (Tim Drake), Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark), Kid Flash (Bart Allen), Solstice, Superboy and two new members - Bunker and Skitter.
A Teen Titans animated television series ran on Cartoon Network from July 2003 to January 2006 based on the 1980s team, but differed from the original. The series spawned two comic book titles, Teen Titans Go! and Tiny Titans. The series returned as a series of mini-shorts on the DC Nation block on Cartoon Network.

PATH trains run 24 hours a day and is one of only five mass-transit rail lines in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, the Red and Blue Lines of the Chicago 'L', the Staten Island Railway, and the New York City Subway). The system has a route length of [tpl]convert|13.8|mi|km[/tpl], not including any route overlap.Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "PATH at a Glance – April 1995."

PATH trains only use tunnels in Manhattan, Hoboken and downtown Jersey City. The tracks cross the Hudson River through century-old cast iron tubes that rest on the river bottom under a thin layer of silt. PATH's route from Grove Street in Jersey City west to Newark runs in open cuts, at grade level, and on elevated track.
While some PATH stations are adjacent or connected to New York City Subway, Newark Light Rail, Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and New Jersey Transit stations, there are no free transfers between these different, independently run transit systems; however, PATH does accept the same pay-per-ride MetroCard used by the New York City Subway, with the exception of Unlimited Ride and EasyPay MetroCards.[tpl]cite web|title=PATH|url=http://www.panynj.gov/path/metrocard.html|work=Metrocard|publisher=The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|accessdate=February 2, 2013[/tpl]

For the first four seasons of the award (1957 to 1960), individual awards were presented to left fielders, center fielders, and right fielders.

The Boston Globe writer Peter Abraham said the Fielding Bible Awards "are far more accurate (and accountable)" than the Gold Glove awards since statistics are used along with the opinions of an expert panel.

[[Linear elasticity]]

CATEGORIES: Elasticity (physics), Solid mechanics

Linear elasticity is the mathematical study of how solid objects deform and become internally stressed due to prescribed loading conditions. Linear elasticity models materials as continua.  Linear elasticity is a simplification of the more general nonlinear theory of elasticity and is a branch of continuum mechanics.  The fundamental "linearizing" assumptions of linear elasticity are: infinitesimal strains or "small" deformations (or strains) and linear relationships between the components of stress and strain.  In addition linear elasticity is valid only for stress states that do not produce yielding.  These assumptions are reasonable for many engineering materials and engineering design scenarios.  Linear elasticity is therefore used extensively in structural analysis and engineering design, often with the aid of finite element analysis.

[[Happy ending]]
CATEGORIES: Narratology, Fiction, Plot (narrative), Recurrent elements in fairy tales

A happy ending is an ending of the plot of a work of fiction in which almost everything turns out for the best for the protagonists, their sidekicks, and almost everyone except the villains.
In storylines where the protagonists are in physical danger, a happy ending mainly consists in their surviving and successfully concluding their quest or mission. Where there is no physical danger, a happy ending is often defined as lovers consummating their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations.
A Times review of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold strongly criticized John le Carré for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as Jack must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story."The Times, September 13, 1968.
A happy ending is epitomized in the standard fairy tale ending phrase, "happily ever after" or "and they lived happily ever after." (One Thousand and One Nights has the more restrained formula they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness (i.e. Death)). Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, at the end of The Lion King, Simba defeats Scar, becomes king, marries and has a daughter, Kiara, thus giving way to The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.

Swami Chinmayananda (8 May 1916 – 3 August 1993) was a Hindu spiritual leader and teacher who inspired the formation of Chinmaya Mission, a worldwide nonprofit organization, to spread the knowledge of Advaita Vedanta, the nondual system of thought found in the Upanishads, which epitomize the philosophical teachings of the Vedas.
Swami Chinmayananda is renowned for teaching Bhagavad-gītā, the Upanishads, and other ancient Hindu scriptures in a logical and scientific manner.[ref]
</ref>
From 1951 onward, he spearheaded a global Hindu spiritual and cultural renaissance that popularized the religion’s esoteric scriptural texts, teaching them in English all across India and abroad.
His wit and erudition made him a dynamic orator, captivating crowds of up to several thousand in free discourses twice a day for nearly 40 years.
Swami Chinmayananda inspired the formation of Chinmaya Mission in 1953. Founded by his disciples and led by him, Chinmaya Mission is a spiritual, educational, and charitable nonprofit organization that encompasses more than 300 centers in India and internationally. Swami Chinmayananda set its mission statement as follows: "To provide to individuals, from any background, the wisdom of Vedanta and practical means for spiritual growth and happiness, enabling them to become positive contributors to society."
Chinmaya Mission is administered by the apex body of Central Chinmaya Mission Trust, in Mumbai, India, now under the leadership of Swami Chinmayananda’s successor, Swami Tejomayananda, the present head of Chinmaya Mission worldwide.
Swami Chinmayananda authored 95 publications in his lifetime, including commentaries on the major Upanishads and Bhagavad-gītā.[tpl]rp|176[/tpl]  He served several American and Asian universities as a visiting professor of Indian philosophy and conducted university lecture tours in many countries.[tpl]rp|13[/tpl]
Through his Vedantic teachings, publications, centers, ashrams, temples, and social service projects around the globe, his work continues to provide cultural and spiritual instruction to members of the Hindu diaspora. He died on August 3, 1993, which his followers mark as the occasion when he attained Mahasamadhi.

The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) was a United Kingdom government department between 2001 and 2007,  responsible for the education system and children's services in England. On 28 June 2007 Gordon Brown's government split it into the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In 2010, when the Conservative/Lib Dem Coalition Government took control, Michael Gove became Secretary of State for Education. His department is the Department for Education.
DfES worked under the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.  Its main remit could be summed up as schools and adult learning, with sections dealing with linked areas such as child welfare.
DfES had four main locations: London (Sanctuary Buildings and Caxton House, both close to Westminster Abbey), Sheffield (Moorfoot),  Darlington (Mowden Hall), and Runcorn (Castle View House), and also regional Government Offices.
Education is a devolved issue and therefore the responsibility of other government departments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Swami Tapovan Maharaj was born in 1889 on the auspicious Suklapaksha Ekadasi day of Margaseersha month. His mother, Kunchamma belonged to an ancient aristocratic Nair family in Palghat Taluk of Kerala. His father, Achutan Nair, belonged to Kotuvayur in Kerala. Even as a little boy, Swami Tapovan Maharaj exhibited a marked partiality for spiritual life. He delighted in worshipping idols fashioned with his own hands. He was admitted to the local English school, but not liking the thoroughly materialistic education, he decided to quit the school and continued his studies in English, Malayalam and Sanskrit with still greater vigor by himself. Under competent teachers he mastered poems, dramas, grammar and logic. He read all available religious literature in Malayalam, Tamil, English and Sanskrit. He also engaged in spiritual exercises.

Using this assessment, it is possible to estimate how much of the Earth (or how many planet Earths) it would take to support humanity if everybody followed a given lifestyle.

[[Functional derivative]]

CATEGORIES: Differential calculus, Topological vector spaces, Differential operators, Calculus of variations, Variational analysis

In the calculus of variations, a field of mathematical analysis, the functional derivative (or variational derivative)[tpl]harv|Giaquinta|Hildebrandt|1996|p=18[/tpl] relates a change in a functional to a change in a function that the functional depends on.
In the calculus of variations, functionals are usually expressed in terms of an integral of  functions, their arguments,  and their derivatives. In an integrand [tpl]math|L[/tpl] of a functional, if a function [tpl]math|f[/tpl]   is varied by adding to it another function [tpl]math|δf[/tpl] that is arbitrarily small, and the resulting [tpl]math|L[/tpl] is expanded in powers of [tpl]math|δf[/tpl], the coefficient of [tpl]math|δf[/tpl] in the first order term is called the functional derivative.
For example, consider the functional
where [tpl]math|f ′(x) ≡ df/dx[/tpl].

[[Fork (software development)]]
CATEGORIES: Software forks, Software project management

In software engineering, a project fork  happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but a split in the developer community, a form of schism."Schism", with its connotations, is a common usage, e.g. "the Lemacs/FSFmacs schism" (Jamie Zawinski, 2000), "Behind the KOffice split" (Joe Brockmeier, Linux Weekly News, 2010-12-14), "Copyright assignment - once bitten, twice shy" (Richard Hillesley, H-Online, 2010-08-06), "Forking is a feature" (Anil Dash, 2010-09-10), "The Great Software Schism" (Glyn Moody, Linux Journal, 2006-09-28), "To Fork Or Not To Fork: Lessons From Ubuntu and Debian" (Benjamin Mako Hill, 2005).
Free and open-source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission without violating any copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (e.g. Unix) also happen.

In computing, particularly in the context of the Unix operating system and its workalikes, fork is an operation whereby a process creates a copy of itself. It is usually a system call, implemented in the kernel. Fork is the primary (and historically, only) method of process creation on Unix-like operating systems.

[[Damsel in distress]]

CATEGORIES: Stock characters, Clichés, Sexual fetishism, Jungian archetypes

The subject of the damsel in distress, or persecuted maiden, is a classic theme in world literature, art, film and video games. She is usually a beautiful young woman placed in a dire predicament by a villain or monster and who requires a hero to achieve her rescue.  After rescuing her the hero can usually convince the woman to be his wife.  She has become a stock character of fiction, particularly of melodrama. Though she is usually human, she can also be of any other species, including fictional or folkloric species; and even divine figures such as an angel or deity.
The word "damsel" derives from the French demoiselle, meaning "young lady", and the term "damsel in distress" in turn is a translation of the French demoiselle en détresse. It is an archaic term not used in modern English except for effect or in expressions such as this, which can be traced back to the knight-errant of Medieval songs and tales, who regarded the saving of such women as an essential part of his purpose.

[[Copynorms]]

CATEGORIES: Copyright law, Intellectual property law

As used by copyright theorists, the term copynorm  (or more frequently copynorms) is used to refer to a normalized social standard regarding the ethical issue of duplicating copyrighted material.  
Questions about the ethics of copying came to public attention as a result of peer-to-peer file sharing systems, such as Napster, Gnutella, KaZaA, BitTorrent and Direct Connect.  Survey research indicates that most users of filesharing systems do not believe that it is wrong to download MP3 files of copyrighted music, even though such downloading may be unlawful.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] 
These questions are important to legal theory, because the ability of copyright law to control the copying of digital material may depend more on voluntary compliance than on hypothetical criminal or civil actions against individuals.

[[Functional integration]]
CATEGORIES: Integral calculus, Functional analysis, Mathematical physics, Quantum mechanics, Quantum field theory

Functional integration is a collection of results in mathematics and physics where the domain of an integral is no longer a region of space, but a space of functions. Functional integrals arise in probability, in the study of partial differential equations, and in the Feynman approach to the quantum mechanics of particles and fields.
In an ordinary integral there is a function to be integrated—the integrand—and a region of space over which to integrate the function—the domain of integration. The process of integration consists of adding up the values of the integrand for each point of the domain of integration.  Making this procedure rigorous requires a limiting procedure, where the domain of integration is divided into smaller and smaller regions.  For each small region the value of the integrand cannot vary much so it may be replaced by a single value. In a functional integral the domain of integration is a space of functions.  For each function the integrand returns a value to add up.  Making this procedure rigorous poses challenges that continue to be topics of current research.
Functional integration was developed by P. J. Daniell in a paper of 1919 and N. Wiener in a series of studies culminating in his papers of 1921 on Brownian motion.  They developed a rigorous method—now known as the Wiener measure—for assigning a probability to a particle's random path.   R. Feynman developed another functional integral, the path integral, useful for computing the quantum properties of systems.  In Feynman's path integral, the classical notion of a unique trajectory for a particle is replaced by an infinite sum of classical paths, each weighted differently according to its classical properties.
Functional integration is central to quantization techniques in theoretical physics.  The algebraic properties of functional integrals are used to develop series used to calculate properties in quantum electrodynamics and the standard model of particle physics.

The Little Mermaid is a 1989 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.  Based on the Danish fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, The Little Mermaid tells the story of a beautiful mermaid who dreams of becoming human.  Written, directed, and produced by Ron Clements and John Musker, with music by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who also served as a co-producer), the film features the voices of Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Pat Carroll, Samuel E. Wright, Jason Marin, Kenneth Mars, Buddy Hackett, and  Rene Auberjonois.
The 28th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, The Little Mermaid was released to theaters on November 17, 1989 to largely positive reviews, garnering $84 million at the box office during its initial release,[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=littlemermaid.htm | title=The Little Mermaid (1989) – Box Office Summary | work=Box Office Mojo |work=Internet Movie Database[/tpl] and $211 million in total lifetime gross.
After the success of the 1988 Disney/Amblin film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Little Mermaid is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after a string of critical or commercial failures produced by Disney that dated back to the early 1970s.

[[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport]]
CATEGORIES: Certified airports in Ontario, Transport in Toronto

Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport [tpl]Airport codes|YTZ|CYTZ[/tpl], commonly known as the Toronto Island Airport, is a small airport located on the Toronto Islands in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is named after Air Marshal Billy Bishop, a Canadian World War I flying ace. The airport is used by civil aviation, air ambulances, and regional airlines using turboprop planes. It is accessed by passenger ferry. In 2011, it was ranked Canada's 9th-busiest airport and Ontario's third-busiest airport by passenger numbers and the 14th-busiest Canadian airport in terms of aircraft movements.torontoport.com – About Us The airport was previously known as Toronto City Centre Airport and Port George VI Island Airport.
Conceived in the 1930s as the main airport for Toronto, the construction of the airport was completed in 1939 by the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC). At the same time, the THC built Malton Airport as an alternate, but Malton became Toronto's main passenger airline hub instead, leaving the island airport for general aviation and military purposes. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs. Malton was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport. After the expansion, civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s. Although regional airlines were introduced in the 1970s, the annual number of flights went into decline and closure was discussed. In 1983, a 50-year tripartite agreement between the governments of Canada, Toronto and the Harbour Commission, which limited noise and banned jet use for scheduled airlines, allowed airport operations to continue. In the 1990s, in an era of government cost-cutting, questions about the airport's future were raised again due to its annual deficit. At the same time, redevelopment was taking over north of the airport and several studies suggested that the airport was incompatible with development.
In 1999, the new Toronto Port Authority (TPA) replaced the THC. The TPA's mandate was to make the Port and Airport self-sufficient and it determined that the airport needed to expand to end the annual subsidy. Although expansion of the airport was and is politically controversial, the TPA has worked with new regional airline Porter Airlines since 2003 to increase scheduled carrier flights. Under the new financial model, carriers pay landing fees and departing passengers pay airport improvement fees to the TPA. Porter launched in 2006 and passenger volumes increased to the point that airport operations became self-sufficient by 2010. In 2011, Porter opened a new terminal. In 2012, the TPA began constructing a pedestrian tunnel to the airport, after a previous plan to build a bridge was cancelled. In 2013, Porter has proposed extending the airport runways and modifying the operating agreement to allow it to use Bombardier CS100 jets at the airport. The proposal is under study.

The Battle of Pavia, fought on the morning of 24 February 1525, was the decisive engagement of the Italian War of 1521–26.
A Spanish-Imperial army under the nominal command of Charles de Lannoy (and working in conjunction with the garrison of Pavia, commanded by Antonio de Leyva) attacked the French army under the personal command of Francis I of France in the great hunting preserve of Mirabello outside the city walls.  In the four-hour battle, the French army was split and defeated in detail.  The French suffered massive casualties, including many of the chief nobles of France; Francis himself, captured by the Spanish troops, was imprisoned by Charles V and forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Madrid, surrendering significant territory to his captor.  The outcome of the battle cemented Spanish Habsburg ascendancy in Italy.

Pages 28 and 29. The offer was made in a letter to Alan Ramsay Hawley, president of the Aero Club of America.
  Gentlemen: As a stimulus to the courageous aviators, I desire to offer, through the auspices and regulations of the Aero Club of America, a prize of $25,000 to the first aviator of any Allied Country crossing the Atlantic in one flight, from Paris to New York or New York to Paris, all other details in your care. 
  Yours very sincerely, 
 Raymond OrteigBak. Page 29. 
The Aero Club replied on May 26 with Orteig confirming his offer three days later. His offer was accepted by the Aero Club who set up a formal structure to administer the competition. On offer for five years, it attracted no competitors. After its original term had expired Orteig reissued the prize on June 1, 1925 by depositing $25,000 in negotiable securities at the Bryant Bank with the awarding put under the control of a seven member board of trustees.Bak. Page 41. By then the state of aviation technology had advanced to the point that numerous competitors vied for the prize.
Several famous aviators made unsuccessful attempts at the New York–Paris flight before relatively unknown American Charles Lindbergh won the prize in 1927 in his aircraft Spirit of St. Louis. Lindbergh chose to fly solo, although this was not a requirement of the prize and required him to be at the controls for more than 30 hours. Lindbergh was the first American ever to cross the Atlantic non-stop in a heavier-than air aircraft (rather than an airship), and he promptly became a national hero. His flight was followed by the "Lindbergh boom", as public interest in air travel bloomed and aviation stocks skyrocketed.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Lindbergh pursued a risky strategy for the competition; instead of the using a tri-motor, as favored by most other groups, he decided on a single engined aircraft. The decision allowed him to save weight and carry extra fuel as a reserve for detours or emergencies. He also decided to fly the aircraft solo, so avoiding the personality conflicts that helped delay at least one group. To save weight which had contributed to the crashes of other contributors, Lindbergh also dispensed with non-essential equipment like radios, sextant and  a parachute (although he did take an inflatable raft. The final factor in his success was his decision to fly into weather conditions that were clearing but not clear enough for others to consider safe. Lindbergh was quoted as saying "What kind of man would live where there is no danger? I don't believe in taking foolish chances. But nothing can be accomplished by not taking a chance at all."Lindbergh: Flight's Enigmatic Hero, Von Hardesty, 2002.
Although advancing public interest and aviation technology, the Prize occasioned expenses many times the value of the prize.  Moreover, lives were lost by men who were competing to win the prize. Six men died in three separate crashes. Another three men were injured in a fourth crash. During the spring and summer of 1927, 40 pilots would attempt various long-distance over-ocean flights, leading to 21 deaths during the attempts. For example, seven lives were lost in August 1927 in the Orteig Prize-inspired $25,000 Dole Air Race to fly from San Francisco to Hawaii.[tpl]cite web | last =Conant| first =Jane Eshelman| authorlink = | date =Oct 10, 1955 | url= http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/27dolerace.html|title = Pioneer Pacific Fliers wrote Tragic Chapter In Air History | work =San Francisco Call-Bulletin| publisher = Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco| accessdate= 2011-08-20[/tpl]
1927 saw a number of aviation first and new records. The record for longest time in the air, longest flight distance, and longest overwater flight would be set and all would exceed Lindbergh's effort. However, no flyer gained the fame that Lindbergh did for winning the Orteig Prize.
The Orteig Prize inspired the $10 million Ansari X Prize for repeated suborbital commercial spaceflights.

Erich Alfred Hartmann (19 April 1922 – 20 September 1993), nicknamed "Bubi" by his comrades and "The Black Devil" by his Soviet adversaries, was a German fighter pilot during World War II and is the most successful fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare. He flew 1,404 combat missions and participated in aerial combat on 825 separate occasions. He claimed, and was credited with, shooting down 352 Allied aircraft—the destruction of each termed an "aerial victory"—while serving with the Luftwaffe. During the course of his career, Hartmann was forced to crash-land his damaged fighter 14 times due to damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had just shot down or mechanical failure. Hartmann was never shot down or forced to land due to enemy fire.Toliver and Constable 1986, p. 12.
Hartmann, a pre-war glider pilot, joined the Luftwaffe in 1940 and completed his fighter pilot training in 1942. He was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52) on the Eastern front and was fortunate to be placed under the supervision of some of the Luftwaffe's most experienced fighter pilots. Under their guidance, Hartmann steadily developed his tactics, which earned him the coveted Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten (Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds) on 25 August 1944 for claiming 301 aerial victories. At the time of its presentation to Hartmann, this was Germany's highest military decoration.[tpl]#tag:ref|In 1944, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds was second only to the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross ([tpl]Lang|de|Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes[/tpl]), which was awarded only to senior commanders for winning a major battle or campaign, in the military order of the Third Reich. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds as the highest military order was surpassed on 29 December 1944 by the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds ([tpl]Lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten[/tpl]).|group="Note"[/tpl]
Hartmann scored his 352nd and last aerial victory on 8 May 1945. Along with the remainder of JG 52, he surrendered to United States Army forces and was turned over to the Red Army. In an attempt to pressure him into service with the Soviet-friendly East German Volksarmee, he was convicted of false war crimes, a conviction posthumously voided by a Russian court as a malicious prosecution. Hartmann was sentenced to 25 years of hard labour and spent 10 years in various Soviet prison camps and gulags until he was released in 1955.
In 1956, Hartmann joined the newly established West German Luftwaffe in the Bundeswehr, and became the first Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 71 "Richthofen". Hartmann resigned early from the Bundeswehr in 1970, largely due to his opposition to the F-104 Starfighter deployment in the Luftwaffe and the resulting clashes with his superiors over this issue. In his later years, after his military career had ended, he became a civilian flight instructor.Berger 1999, p. 107. He died of natural causes on 20 September 1993.

Grand Central Terminal (GCT) is a commuter (and former intercity) railroad terminal at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, United States.[tpl]#tag:ref|Grand Central Terminal is often incorrectly referred to as "Grand Central Station", the name of the adjacent block square U.S. Post Office station located immediately northeast of GCT at 450 Lexington Avenue. In railroading, a "terminal" such as GCT is a passenger and/or freight facility at the end of a rail line which trains enter from and depart in the same direction whereas a railroad "station" such as Pennsylvania Station is an intermediate facility along a rail line which trains enter, stop, and depart in opposite directions.A "Grand" Central Terminal Wilton Magazine (2004)|group=N[/tpl] Built by and named for the New York Central Railroad in the heyday of American long-distance passenger rail travel, it is the largest such facility in the world by number of platforms[tpl]cite web|first=George |last=Haikalis |url=http://www.auto-free.org/regiongc.html |title=Regional Rail Working Group: Streamlining Access to Grand Central Terminal |at=Section entitled "What are MTA's objections to this streamlined plan?" |publisher=Auto-free.org |date=November 11, 2006 |accessdate=2014-02-03[/tpl] with 44 serving 67 tracks along them.

The terminal serves commuters traveling on the Metro-North Railroad to Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess counties in New York State, and Fairfield and New Haven counties in Connecticut. Until 1991 the terminal served Amtrak, which moved to nearby Pennsylvania Station upon completion of the Empire Connection.
Although the terminal has been properly called “Grand Central Terminal” since 1913, many people continue to refer to it wrongly as “Grand Central Station,” the name of the previous rail station on the same site, and of the U.S. Post Office station next door, which is not part of the terminal.

Makapu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u is the extreme eastern end of the Island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu in the Hawaiian Islands, comprising the remnant of a ridge that rises 647 feet (197 m) above the sea. The cliff at Makapu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u Point forms the eastern tip and is the site of a prominent lighthouse.  The place name of this area, meaning "bulging eye" in Hawaiian, is thought to derive from the name of an image said to have been located in a cave here called Keanaokeakuapōloli. The entire area is quite scenic and a panoramic view is presented at the lookout on Kalanianaole Highway (State Rte. 72) where the roadway surmounts the cliff just before turning south towards leeward O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu and Honolulu.
The Makapu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u area is reached approximately [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] east of Waimānalo Beach on Kalanianaole Highway (State Rte. 72) or from the Honolulu side (south shore; Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Kai) travelling east along the same highway beyond Sandy Beach.

It is a common misconception among South Asians that hijras are "only men who have feminine gender identity, adopt feminine gender roles and wear women's clothing". In reality, the community is significantly more diverse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sahodari.org/FTM.html|title= When we say transgender rights, we strongly mean Female-to-male transgender people’s rights too|publisher=Sahoodari|accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl]
In Pakistan, the hijras identify themselves as either female, male, or third gender. The term more commonly advocated by social workers and transgender community members themselves is 'khwaaja sira' ([tpl]lang-ur|[tpl]Nastaliq|خواجه سرا[/tpl][/tpl]), and can identify the individual as a transsexual person, transgender person (khusras), cross-dresser (zenanas) or eunuch (narnbans).[tpl]cite journal |title=Awareness about sexually transmitted infections among Hijra sex workers of Rawalpindi/Islamabad |journal=Pakistan Journal of Public Health |year=2012 |url=http://test.hsa.edu.pk/journal/issue-march2012vol2no1/Abdullah%20MA.OA.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://positiveimpactmagazine.com/a-second-look-at-pakistans-third-gender/|title=A Second Look at Pakistan’s Third Gender|publisher=Positive Impact Magazine|accessdate=2014-02-02[/tpl]
Hijras have a recorded history in the Indian subcontinent, from antiquity, as suggested by the Kama Sutra period, onwards. This history features a number of well-known roles within subcontinental cultures, part gender-liminal, part spiritual, and part survival.
In South Asia, many hijras live in well-defined and organized all-hijra communities, led by a guru."The most significant relationship in the hijra community is that of the guru (master, teacher) and chela (disciple)." Serena Nanda, "The hijras of India: Cultural and Individual Dimensions of an Institutionalized Third Gender Role", Journal of Homosexuality 11 (1986): 35–54."Hijras are organized into households with a hijra guru as head, into territories delimiting where each household can dance and demand money from merchants". L Cohen, "The Pleasures of Castration: the postoperative status of hijras, jankhas and academics", in Paul R. Abramson, Steven D. Pinkerton (eds), Sexual Nature, Sexual Culture, (University of Chicago Press, 1995). These communities have sustained themselves over generations by "adopting" young boys who are rejected by, or flee their family of origin."None of the hijra narratives I recorded supports the widespread belief in India that hijras recruit their membership by making successful claims on intersex infants. Instead, it appears that most hijras join the community in their youth, either out of a desire to more fully express their feminine gender identity, under the pressure of poverty, because of ill treatment by parents and peers for feminine behaviour, after a period of homosexual prostitution, or for a combination of these reasons." RB Towle, and LM Morgan, "Romancing the Transgender Native: Rethinking the Use of the 'Third Gender' Concept", in S. Stryker and S. Whittle (eds), Transgender Studies Reader, (Routledge, 2006), p. 116. Many work as sex workers for survival.
The word "hijra" is a Urdu-Hindustani word derived from the Semitic Arabic root hjr in its sense of "leaving one's tribe,""hjr (main meanings): a) to break with, leave, forsake, renounce, emigrate, flee" Lahzar Zanned, "Root formation and polysemic organization", in Mohammad T. Alhawary and Elabbas Benmamoun (eds), Perspectives on Arabic linguistics XVII-XVIII: papers from the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Annual Symposia on Arabic Linguistics, (John Benjamins, 2005), p. 97. and has been borrowed into Hindi. The Indian usage has traditionally been translated into English as "eunuch" or "hermaphrodite," where "the irregularity of the male genitalia is central to the definition."Serena Nanda, Neither Man nor Woman: The Hijras of India, (1999). However, in general hijras are born with typically male physiology, only a few having been born with male intersex variations."Among thirty of my informants, only one appeared to have been born intersexed." Serena Nanda, "Deviant careers: the hijras of India", chapter 7 in Morris Freilich, Douglas Raybeck and Joel S. Savishinsky (eds), Deviance: anthropological perspectives, (Greenwood Publishing, 1991). Some Hijras undergo an initiation rite into the hijra community called nirwaan, which refers to the removal of penis, testicles and scrotum.
Since the late 20th century, some hijra activists and Western non-government organizations (NGOs) have lobbied for official recognition of the hijra as a kind of "third sex" or "third gender," as neither man nor woman.Anuja Agrawal, "Gendered Bodies: The Case of the 'Third Gender' in India", Contributions to Indian Sociology series 31 (1997): 273–97.

Barrier Islands, a coastal landform and a type of barrier system, are exceptionally flat and lumpy areas of sand, that are parallel to the mainland coast. They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few islands to more than a dozen. Excepting the tidal inlets that separate the islands, a barrier chain may extend uninterrupted for over a hundred kilometers, the longest and widest being Padre Island.Garrison, J.R., Jr., Williams, J., Potter Miller, S., Weber, E.T., II, McMechan, G., and Zeng, X., 2010, Ground-penetrating radar study of North Padre Island; Implications for barrier island interval architecture, model for growth of progradational microtidal barrier islands, and Gulf of Mexico sea-level cyclicity: Journal of Sedimentary Research, v. 80, p. 303–319. The length and width of barriers and overall morphology of barrier coasts are related to parameters including tidal range, wave energy, sediment supply, sea-level trends and basement controls.Davis Jr., p. 144.
Chains of barrier islands can be found along approximately thirteen percent of the world's coastlines,Smith, Q.H.T., Heap, A.D., and Nichol, S.L., 2010, Origin and formation of an estuarine barrier island, Tapora Island, New Zealand: Journal of Coastal Research, v. 26, p. 292–300. some displaying different settings, suggesting that they can form and be maintained in a variety of environmental settings.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in  ethics, first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967,Philippa Foot, The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect in Virtues and Vices (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978)(originally appeared in the Oxford Review, Number 5, 1967.) but also extensively analysed by Judith Jarvis Thomson,Judith Jarvis Thomson, Killing, Letting Die, and the Trolley Problem, 59 The Monist 204-17 (1976)Judith Jarvis Thomson, The Trolley Problem, 94 Yale Law Journal 1395-1415 (1985) Peter Unger,Peter Unger, Living High and Letting Die (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) and Frances Kamm as recently as 1996.Francis Myrna Kamm, Harming Some to Save Others, 57 Philosophical Studies 227-60 (1989)
Outside of the domain of traditional philosophical discussion, the trolley problem has been a significant feature in the fields of cognitive science and, more recently, of neuroethics. It has also been a topic on various TV shows dealing with human psychology.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
The general form of the problem is this: There is a runaway trolley barrelling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You do not have the ability to operate the lever in a way that would cause the trolley to derail without loss of life (for example, holding the lever in an intermediate position so that the trolley goes between the two sets of tracks, or pulling the lever after the front wheels pass the switch, but before the rear wheels do). You have two options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. Which is the correct choice?

[[Setting pole]]

CATEGORIES: Water transport

A setting pole is a pole, handled by a single individual, made to move watercraft by pushing the craft in the desired direction.  Because it is a pushing tool, it is generally used from the stern (back) of the craft.
A setting pole is usually made of ash, or a similar resilient wood, and is capped on one or both ends with metal to withstand the repeated pushing against the bottom and rocks, and to help the end of the pole sink to the bottom more quickly. It can range in length from eight feet (2.5 metres), to over fifteen feet (4.5 metres).
The best known form of setting pole is the single-ended punt pole used in Oxford and Cambridge.  A setting pole may also be used in river canoeing for navigating portions of river where the water is too shallow for a paddle to create thrust, or where the desired direction of travel is opposite a current moving fast enough to make paddling inefficient and the water is shallow enough to make poling possible.

[[De Sitter space]]

CATEGORIES: Exact solutions in general relativity, Riemannian geometry

De Sitter space was discovered by  Willem de Sitter, and, at the same time, independently by Tullio Levi-Civita.
More recently it has been considered as the setting for Special Relativity rather than using Minkowski space, since a group contraction reduces the isometry group of de Sitter space to the Poincaré group, allowing a unification of the spacetime translation subgroup and Lorentz transformation subgroup of the Poincaré group into a simple group rather than a semi-simple group. This alternate formulation of Special Relativity is called de Sitter relativity.

[[Anti-de Sitter space]]
CATEGORIES: Exact solutions in general relativity, Differential geometry

It is best known for its role in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The Anti-de Sitter space, as well as the de Sitter space is named after Willem de Sitter (1872-1934), professor of astronomy at Leiden University and director of the Leiden Observatory. Willem de Sitter and Albert Einstein worked in the 1920's in Leiden closely together on the space-time structure of our universe. 
In mathematics, anti-de Sitter space is sometimes defined more generally as a space of arbitrary signature (p,q). Generally in physics only the case of one timelike dimension is relevant. Because of differing sign conventions, this may correspond to a signature of either (n−1, 1) or (1, n−1).

Trotula is a name referring to a group of three texts on women's medicine, the Trotula, that were composed in the southern Italian port town of Salerno in the 12th century.  The name derives from a historic female figure, Trota of Salerno, a physician and medical writer who was associated with one of the three texts.  However, "Trotula" came to be understood as a real person in the Middle Ages and because the so-called Trotula texts circulated widely throughout medieval Europe, from Spain to Poland, and Sicily to Ireland, "Trotula" has historic importance in "her" own right.Monica H.

[[Filiation]]

CATEGORIES: Kinship and descent, Family law, Adoption law

Filiation is the legal termFiliation, Lawyers International Law Dictionary that refers to the recognized legal status of the relationship between family members, or more specifically the legal relationship between parent and child.  As described by the Government of Quebec:  
 Filiation is the relationship which exists between a child and the child’s parents, whether the parents are of the same or the opposite sex. The relationship can be established by blood, by law in certain cases, or by a judgment of adoption. Once filiation has been established, it creates rights and obligations for both the child and the parents, regardless of the circumstances of the child’s birth."Filiation," Ministère de la Justice du Québec 
Filiation differs from, but impacts, both parental rights and inheritance.  
An example of law regarding filiation is found in the Civil Code of Quebec, Book 2, Title 2 "Filiation",Quebec Civil Code, Gouvernement du Québec which details how filiation may be established, claimed, and transferred.

Simon Thomas Fraser (20 May 1776 – 18 August 1862) was a Scottish fur trader and an explorer who charted much of what is now the Canadian province of British Columbia. Fraser was employed by the Montreal-based North West Company. By 1805, he had been put in charge of all the company's operations west of the Rocky Mountains. He was responsible for building that area's first trading posts, and, in 1808, he explored what is now known as the Fraser River, which bears his name. Simon Fraser's exploratory efforts were partly responsible for Canada's boundary later being established at the 49th parallel (after the War of 1812), since he as a British subject was the first European to establish permanent settlements in the area. According to historian Alexander Begg, Fraser "was offered a knighthood but declined the title due to his limited wealth"History of British Columbia from its earliest discovery to the present time, p. 97, Alexander Begg, publ. William Briggs, Toronto, 1894. In 1965, a university was built and named Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia.

Xu Wei ([tpl]zh|c=徐渭|p=Xú Wèi|w=Hsü Wei[/tpl], 1521—1593) was a Ming Chinese painter, poet, writer and dramatist famed for his artistic expressiveness.Cihai: Page 802.  Revolutionary for its time, his painting style influenced and inspired countless subsequent painters, such as Bada Shanren, the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, and the modern masters Wu Changshuo and Qi Baishi.Barnhart: Page 232. Qi once exclaimed in a poem that "How I wish to be born 300 years earlier so I could grind ink and prepare paper for Green Vine ( A Xu Wei pen name)" (恨不生三百年前，為青藤磨墨理紙). Xu Wei can be considered as the founder of modern painting in China. His influence continues to exert itself. Despite his posthumous recognition, Xu was manifestly mentally ill and unsuccessful in life, ending his life in poverty after the murder of his third wife and several attempts at suicide. 
His courtesy names were Wenqing (文清)and then later Wenchang (文長). His pseudonyms were The Mountain-man of the Heavenly Pond (天池山人 Tiānchí Shānrén), Daoist of the Green Vine House (青藤道士 Qīngténg Dàoshì) and The Water and Moon of the Bureau's Farm (署田水月 Shǔtián Shuǐ Yuè). Born in Shanyin (山阴 - now Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province), Xu was raised by a single mother who died when he was 14. At 21, he married Pan-shi (潘氏), who died five years later.  Though he passed the county civil examination at age 20, Xu was never able to pass the provincial civil service examinations, even after attempting it eight times.Barnhart: Page 230. Nevertheless, Xu was employed by General Hu Zongxian (胡宗憲), Supreme Commander of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Fujian coastal defense against the wokou pirates. 
After General Hu was arrested and lost his position, Xu Wei also feared a negative fate for himself. Xu became mentally distraught at this juncture, attempting to commit suicide nine times, such as by axing himself in the skull and drilling both of his ears. His mental imbalance led to his killing of his second wife Zhang-shi (張氏) after becoming paranoid that she was having an affair. As a punishment for committing this murder, he was jailed for seven years until his friend Zhang Yuanbian (張元忭) from the Hanlin Imperial Academy managed to free him at age of 53. It is possible Xu Wei suffered from Bipolar Disorder, a condition actually recognized in China at this time. Xu spent the rest of his life painting, but with little financial success. However, his paintings have been highly sought after in modern times.

Saint Arnulf of Metz (c. 582[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]640) was a Frankish bishop of Metz and advisor to the Merovingian court of Austrasia, who retired to the Abbey of Remiremont.
Arnulf was born to an important Frankish family at an uncertain date around 582. His father was probably Bodegisel (d. 585/8), Palace Mayor and Duke of Sueve and his mother probably Saint Oda, Abbess of Amay. In his younger years he was called to the Merovingian court of king Theudebert II (595–612) of Austrasia and sent to serve as dux at the Schelde. Later he became bishop of Metz. During his career he was attracted to religious life, and he retired to become a monk. After his death he was canonized as a saint. In French he is also known as Arnoul or Arnoulf.  In English he is also known as Arnold.
Arnulf gave distinguished service at the Austrasian court under Theudebert II After the death of Theudebert in 612 he was made bishop of Metz. The rule of Austrasia came into the hands of Brunhilda, the grandmother of Theudebert, who ruled also in Burgundy in the name of her great-grandchildren. In 613 Arnulf joined his politics with Pippin of Landen and led the opposition of Frankish nobles against Queen Brunhilda. The revolt led to her overthrow, torture, and eventual execution, and the subsequent reunification of Frankish lands under Chlothachar II.
Chlothachar later made his son Dagobert I king of Austrasia and he ruled with the help of his adviser Arnulf. Not satisfied with his position as a bishop, he was involved in the 624 murder of Chrodoald, an important leader of the Frankish Agilolfings family and a protégé of Dagobert.
From 623 (with Pippin of Landen, then the Mayor of the Palace), Arnulf was an adviser to Dagobert I. He retired around 628 to a hermitage at a mountain site in the Vosges, to realize his lifelong resolution to become a monk and a hermit. His friend Romaric, whose parents were killed by Brunhilda, had preceded him to the mountains and together with Amatus had already established Remiremont Abbey there. Arnulf settled there, and remained there until his death twelve years later.
Arnulf was married ca 596 to a woman whom later sources give the name of Dode or Doda, (born ca 584), and had children. Chlodulf of Metz was his oldest son, but more important is his second son Ansegisel, who married Begga daughter of Pepin I, Pippin of Landen. Arnulf is thus the male-line grandfather of Pepin of Herstal, great-grandfather of Charles Martel and 3rd great grandfather of Charlemagne.
Arnulf was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. In iconography he is portrayed with a rake in his hand.

The float is filled with gasoline because this is readily available, buoyant, and for all practical purposes, incompressible. The incompressibility of the gasoline means the tanks can be very lightly constructed as the pressure inside and outside  the tanks equalises and they are not required to withstand any pressure differential at all.  By contrast the crew cabin must withstand a huge pressure differential and is massively built.  Buoyancy can be trimmed easily by replacing gasoline with water, which is denser.
Auguste Piccard, inventor of the first bathyscaphe, composed the name bathyscaphe using the Ancient Greek words βαθύς bathys ("deep") and σκάφος skaphos ("vessel"/"ship").

In Germany, the revolt is often called People's Uprising in East Germany (Volksaufstand in der DDR).http://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/Wissen/Publikationen/Publikationen/E_kowalczuk_17-juni-volksaufstand.html In remembrance of it, June 17 used to be the national holiday of West Germany until reunification.
The uprising in East Berlin was violently suppressed by tanks of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and the Volkspolizei. In spite of the intervention of Soviet troops, the wave of strikes and protests was not easily brought under control. Even after 17 June, there were demonstrations in more than 500 towns and villages.

[[Right whale]]

[tpl]About|three species of whale in the genus Eubalaena|a close relative that was recently excluded from the right whales|Bowhead whale[tpl]![/tpl]bowhead whale (Balaena)|other uses[/tpl]
[tpl]Use mdy dates|date=May 2012[/tpl][tpl]pp-move-indef[/tpl]

Right whales are three species of large baleen whales of the genus Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), the North Pacific right whale (E. japonica) and the southern right whale (E. australis). They are classified in the family Balaenidae with the bowhead whale. Right whales have rotund bodies with arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin. The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough patches of skin on its head which appear white due to parasitism by whale lice. Right whales can grow up to [tpl]convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weigh up to [tpl]convert|100|ST|t LT[/tpl], significantly larger than humpbacks or grays, but smaller than blues.
All three species are migratory, moving seasonally to feed or give birth. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that isolates the northern and southern species from one another. In the Northern Hemisphere, Right whales tend to avoid open waters and stay close to peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods. In the Southern Hemisphere, right whales feed far offshore in summer, but a large portion of the population occur in near shore waters in winter. Right whales feed mainly on copepods but also consume krill and pteropods. They may forage the surface, underwater or even on the ocean bottom. During courtship, males gather into large groups to compete for a single female, suggesting that sperm competition appears to be an important factor in mating behavior. Although the blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, the testes of the right whale are actually ten times larger than those of the blue whale – with each weighing up to [tpl]convert|525|kg|lb[/tpl], they are by far the largest of any animal on Earth. Gestation tends to last a year, and calves are born at [tpl]convert|1|ST|t LT[/tpl] in weight and [tpl]convert|4|-|6|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. Weaning occurs after eight months.
Because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produced high yields of whale oil), right whales were a preferred target for whalers. Today, the North Atlantic and North Pacific right whales are among the most endangered whales in the world, and both species are protected in the United States by the Endangered Species Act. The western populations of both are currently endangered, with their total populations numbering in the hundreds. The eastern North Pacific population, on the other hand, with less than 50 individuals remaining, is critically endangered[tpl]IUCN2012.1 |assessors=Reilly, S.B.; Bannister, J.L.; Best, P.B.; Brown, M.; Brownell Jr.; R.L., Butterworth, D.S.; Clapham, P.J.; Cooke, J.; Donovan, G.P.; Urbán, J.; Zerbini, A.N.|year=2008|id=133706|title=Eubalaena japonica (Northeast Pacific subpopulation)|downloaded=30 September 2012[/tpl] – further still, the eastern North Atlantic population, which numbers in the low teens at best, may already be functionally extinct.[tpl]cite web|title=North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) 5-year review: Summary and Evaluation  |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service |location=Gloucester, MA |date=August 2012 |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/species/narightwhale_5yearreview.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=9 December 2012 |quote=The western North Atlantic population numbered at least 361 individuals in 2005 and at least 396 in 2010 (Waring et al. 2012).[/tpl]  Although no longer facing a threat from whaling, mankind remains by far the greatest threat to these species: the two leading causes of death are from being struck by ships, and from entanglement in fishing gear.

[[Southern right whale]]
CATEGORIES: Balaenidae, Cetaceans of Australia, Megafauna, Fauna of the Atlantic Ocean, Fauna of the Pacific Ocean

The southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) is a baleen whale, one of three species classified as right whales belonging to the genus Eubalaena. Like other right whales, the southern right whale is readily distinguished from others by the callosities on its head, a broad back without a dorsal fin, and a long arching mouth that begins above the eye. Its skin is very dark grey or black, occasionally with some white patches on the belly. The right whale's callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids (whale lice). It is almost indistinguishable from the closely related North Atlantic and the North Pacific right whales, displaying only minor skull differences. It may have fewer callosities on its head and more on its lower lips than the two northern species. Approximately 10,000 southern right whales are spread throughout the southern part of the Southern Hemisphere.
The maximum size of an adult female is [tpl]convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]Branch, G.M., Branch, M.L, Griffiths, C.L. and Beckley, L.E. 2010.

The testicles of right whales are likely to be the largest of any animal, each weighing around [tpl]convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. This suggests that sperm competition is important in the mating process.[tpl]cite web | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Eubalaena_glacialis.html | author = Crane, J. and R.

Right whales cannot cross the warm equatorial waters to connect with the other (sub)species and (inter)breed: their thick layers of insulating blubber make it impossible for them to dissipate their internal body heat in tropical waters.
Proportion and number of molten colored individuals are considerably notable in this species that cannot be observed in the other species in Northern Hemisphere. Some whales remain white even after growing up.http://www.victorharbortimes.com.au/story/1671907/white-whale-in-middleton/?cs=1285

[[Magnus effect]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid dynamics

The Magnus effect is the commonly observed effect in which a spinning ball (or cylinder) curves away from its principal flight path. It is important in many ball sports. It affects spinning missiles, and has some engineering uses, for instance in the design of rotor ships and Flettner aeroplanes.
In terms of ball games, top spin is defined as spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the direction of travel, where the top surface of the ball is moving forward with the spin. Under the Magnus effect, top spin produces a downward swerve of a moving ball, greater than would be produced by gravity alone, and back spin has the opposite effect.http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/golf.html Likewise side-spin causes swerve to either side as seen during some baseball pitches.The Curveball, The Physics of Baseball.
The overall behaviour is similar to that around an airfoil (see lift force) with a circulation which is generated by the mechanical rotation, rather than by airfoil action.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Section 4.6
It is named for Gustav Magnus, the German physicist who investigated it.  The force on a rotating cylinder is known as Kutta-Joukowski lift, after Martin Wilhelm Kutta and Nikolai Zhukovsky (or Joukowski) who first analyzed the effect.

[[The Parliament of Bees]]

CATEGORIES: 1641 poems, English poems

The Parliament of Bees is the best-known of the works of the Elizabethan dramatist, John Day. It was probably written sometime between 1608 and 1616, but not published till 1641.
The poem was entered into the Stationers' Register on 23 March 1641 and printed later in the year by the bookseller William Lee. The quarto is titled "The Parliament of Bees, with their Proper Characters. Or a beehive furnished with twelve honeycombs, as pleasant as profitable. Being an allegorical description of the actions of good and bad men in these our days. By John Day, sometimes student of Caius College in Cambridge." (Spellings modernized.) The quarto is dedicated to George Butler.
The poem also exists in manuscript, identified as Lansdowne MS. 725. The manuscript's title is "An old manuscript containing the Parliament of Bees, found in a hollow tree in a garden in Hibla, in a strange language, and now faithfully translated into easy English verse by John Day, Cantabridg." (Spellings modernized.) The manuscript is prefaced with Epistles to The Reader and to William Augustine. The printed text and the manuscript show significant differences.
Some of the twelve characters had been published prior to 1641. Two, nos. 4 and 5, were printed in a volume titled The Noble Soldier (1634), attributed to "S. R." Five others, nos. 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9, appeared under different names in The Wonder of a Kingdom (1636), attributed to Thomas Dekker. 
The Parliament of Bees is a series of dialogues on the subject of "the doings, the births, the wars, the wooings" of bees. The bees hold a parliament under Prorex, the Master Bee, and various complaints are preferred against the humble-bee, the wasp, the drone and other offenders. This satirical allegory of affairs ends with a Royal Progress by Oberon, who distributes justice to all.

Mustafa Hamsho ([tpl]lang-ar|مصطفى حمشو[/tpl]; born in 10 October 1953) is a retired Assyrian/Syriac boxer who never won a world title, but fought some big names in his career. Though he was not a winner in all of those fights, he did some things to make every one of his fights interesting and controversial in some regard. The Syrian Slugger racked up a winning record in the late 1970s, defeated Wilford Scypion in 1979[tpl]cite journal|date=May 26, 1983|title= Boxing not game to Wilford Scypion |journal=Star-News  (Associated Press)|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HcgsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gRMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6223,2812184&dq=mustafa-hamsho+wilford-scypion&hl=en[/tpl] and former world middleweight champion Alan Minter in 1981http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/3245/tough-tough-guy-named-mustafa-hamsho/ to get a shot at then-champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler in October of that year, but showed no respect for the champion during their matchup - or at least for the time it lasted.  Hagler methodically used left jabs and right crosses to bust up Hamsho's face (which needed 55 stitches) until the fight was stopped on cuts in the 11th.  
Hamsho continued to fight, defeating Curtis Parker, future world champion Bobby Czyz, and former three-division world champion Wilfred Benítez during 1982 and 1983, then received a return visit to take on Hagler in a rematch in October 1984 in NYC's Madison Square Garden.  After Hamsho tried to play rough in the early going, Hagler ended things early this time by flooring Hamsho twice in the third round (the second knockdown produced by a Floyd Patterson-like hook), thus forcing Hamsho's trainer to jump in and stop the fight.  Hamsho would continue to fight, with the biggest name on his list being Donny Lalonde, who decisioned Hamsho in the spring of 1987 and would then go on to become light heavyweight champion later that year.  Hamsho's career would then peter out over the next few years.

Prumnopitys taxifolia (Mataī or Black pine) is an endemic New Zealand coniferous tree that grows on the North Island and South Island. It also occurs on Stewart Island/Rakiura (47 °S) but is uncommon there.   
It grows up to 40 m high, with a trunk up to 2 m diameter. The leaves are linear to sickle-shaped, 10–15 mm long and 1.5–2 mm broad. The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 3–4 cm long bearing 1-6 scales, each scale maturing berry-like, 10–15 mm long, violet-purple with a soft edible pulp covering the single seed. The seeds are dispersed by the Kererū (New Zealand Pigeon), which eats the 'berries' and passes the seeds in its droppings.

[[M-expression]]

CATEGORIES: Lisp programming language

In computer programming, M-expressions (or meta-expressions) were intended to be the expressions used to write functions in the Lisp programming language.  Data to be manipulated using M-expressions was to be written using S-expressions.  M-expressions were used for the original theoretical language in early papers about Lisp, but the first working implementation of Lisp interpreted encodings of M-expressions as S-expressions, and M-expressions were never actually implemented.
[tpl]cquote2|The project of defining M-expressions precisely and compiling them or at least translating them into S-expressions was neither finalized nor explicitly abandoned.

[[Alpha-Amanitin]]

CATEGORIES: Cyclic peptides, Amatoxins, Hepatology, Indoles

''alpha''-Amanitin or α-amanitin is a cyclic peptide of eight amino acids. It is possibly the most deadly of all the amatoxins, toxins found in several species of the Amanita genus of mushrooms, one being the death cap (Amanita phalloides) as well as the destroying angel, a complex of similar species, principally A. virosa and A. bisporigera.  It is also found in the mushrooms Galerina marginata and Conocybe filaris. The oral [tpl]LD50[/tpl] of amanitin is approximately 0.1 mg/kg.
The structure of the polypeptide is atypical of most polypeptides, due to the branching of the amino acid chain.  A cross bridge between 6-hydroxy-tryptophan and cysteine allows the formation of a second "inner loop," as seen in the diagram at right.  The "outer loop" is formed by the normal peptide bond of the carboxyl terminus to the amino terminus of the peptide chain.
Unlike other known fungal cyclic peptides, amatoxins (and phallotoxins such as phalloidin) are synthesized on ribosomes. Heather Hallen, working in the laboratory of Jonathan Walton at Michigan State University, first isolated the genes encoding the proproteins for alpha-amanitin and phallacidin[tpl]cite journal | author = H.

[[Universology]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy of science

Universology literally means "the science of the universe." Popularizing universologic science was a life's work for 19th century intellectual Stephen Pearl Andrews, a futurist utopian. The word can be used synonymously with consilience, a term Edward Osborne Wilson has popularized with his writings elucidating the apparent unity of all knowledge.
In recent years, Dr. Mamoru Mohri, Japan's first astronaut and Director of Japan's National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, has popularized and expanded on universology. For Mohri the universological worldview was an epiphany after seeing the planet from space on two missions in the 1990s, and he has become the chief proponent of universology today. "Everything in this universe is part of an uninterrupted sequence of events" Mohri has said.
Universology, with its relativist and human-centered perspective, has vast implications for religion, philosophy and the practice of natural and social sciences.
In 1872 Andrews published "The Basic Outline of Universology" which was subtitled "An introduction to the newly discovered science of the universe, its elementary principles, and the first stages of their development in the special sciences."
Ilya Romanovich Prigogine (born on January 25, 1917) was a Belgian and American physicist and chemist who was born in Russia and became a Nobel Prize laureate in chemistry. In the book "Order Out of Chaos: Man's New Dialogue With Nature", which he co-wrote with Isabelle Stengers, another professor at Prigogine's group in the University of Brussels, Prigogine states:
"Altogether, we tend to accept the idea propelled by Dialectical Materialism, regarding the necessity of overcoming the antithesis of humane, historical realm and the material world, perceived as atemporal. We do believe, that the setting rapprochement of these opposites will have to be enhanced, as there will be new approaches which will outline the internally evolving Universe, which we are part of." A central aspect of the ways of "outlining the internally evolving Universe", that is what Universology is all about.
Lately, Universology has been rapidly developing due to the contribution of V.A. Polyakov - the author of numerous books in the fields of causal systemology, universal management methodology, and business administration psychology.  He also pioneered in applying effective methods of systemic disease prevention, psychosystemology, a system of continuous education, group strategy, and the self-government of society.
V.A. Polyakov is the creator and the leader of the International Science School of Universology, consisting of hundreds of teams that develop and apply Universology as a philosophical school, and provide a methodology for a healthy lifestyle.

[[Death march]]
CATEGORIES: War crimes, Crimes against humanity, Forced marches

A death march is a forced march of prisoners of war or other captives or deportees with the intent to kill, brutalize, weaken and/or demoralize as many of the captives as possible along the way. It is distinguished in this way from simple prisoner transport via foot march. Death marches usually feature harsh physical labor and abuse, neglect of prisoner injury and illness, deliberate starvation and dehydration, humiliation and torture, and execution of those unable to keep up the marching pace. The march may end at a prisoner-of-war camp or internment camp, or it may continue until all the prisoners are dead (a form of "execution by labor", as seen in the Armenian genocide among other examples).

Sir Henry Parkes, GCMG (27 May 1815[tpl]cite Australasia|Parkes, Hon. Sir Henry[/tpl] – 27 April 1896) was a statesman and politician who is considered the Father of the Australian Federation. As the earliest advocate of a Federal Council of the colonies of Australia, a precursor to the Commonwealth of Australia, he was the most prominent of the Australian Founding Fathers.
Parkes was described during his lifetime by The Times as "the most commanding figure in Australian politics". Alfred Deakin described him as "though not rich or versatile, his personality was massive, durable and imposing, resting upon elementary qualities of human nature elevated by a strong mind. He was cast in the mould of a great man and though he suffered from numerous pettinesses, spites and failings, he was in himself a large-brained self-educated Titan whose natural field was found in Parliament and whose resources of character and intellect enabled him in his later years to overshadow all his contemporaries".[ref]
</ref>
Parkes was tall, with rugged facial features, a leonine mane of hair and a commanding personality. He was a persuasive orator, too, who eschewed flights of rhetoric and spoke as a plain man to plain men, with great effect, in spite of occasional difficulties in controlling his aspirates. He had no schooling worthy of the name but had read widely. It has been said of him that he lacked gracious manners and was too conscious of his intellectual superiority, but his kindly reception in the UK by the likes of Thomas Carlyle and Alfred, Lord Tennyson, suggests that he was not without charm. He was interested in early Australian literary men, having been a friend of both Harpur and Kendall. He was a bad manager of his own affairs; what he had he spent, and he died penniless. He is the father of Katherine Parkes.
Yet he evidently knew a good financier when he saw one, for he had able treasurers serving in each of his cabinets, and their financial administration was sound. He was vain and temperamental, and frequently resigned his parliamentary seat only to seek election again soon afterwards. He was not a socialist but he had strong views about the rights of the people and for most of his parliamentary life was a great leader of them. In his later years, however, he seems to have been worn down by the strong conservative opposition he encountered, and he was responsible for a smaller body of social-reform legislation than might have been expected. Early to recognise the need for Australian Federation, when he saw that it had really become possible to achieve, he fought strongly for it, at a time when many leading politicians in New South Wales were fearful of its effect on their colony. The indomitable character which had raised him from farm labourer to premier, and his recognition of the altruistic broader view that was required in a great movement such as Federation, had an immense effect when the cause's fate was in doubt, and weighted the scale in its favour.[ref]

W was originally developed at Stanford University by Paul Asente and Brian Reid for the V operating system. In 1983, Paul Asente and Chris Kent ported the system to UNIX on the VS100, giving a copy to those working at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science.
In 1984, Bob Scheifler of MIT replaced the synchronous protocol of W with an asynchronous alternative and named the result X.
Since this time the X window system has gone through many fundamental changes and no longer bears any significant resemblance to W.
