Maysalun ([tpl]lang-ar|ميسلون[/tpl]) is a mountainous region in southwestern Syrian located on the eastern slopes of the Anti-Lebanon mountains about 12 kilometers west of Damascus, in the Rif Dimashq Governorate and has an altitude of about 1090 meters. The area is situated on the ancient route between Damascus and Lebanon and has long been famous for its khans and rest-stops. The closest town in the area is al-Dimas.
Maysalun is enshrined in Syrian history as the site where the Syrian minister of war, Yusuf al-Azma refused to give in to the French and English Colonial designs by putting up a fight.William Cleveland, A history of the Modern Middle East, Third Edition, p. 166. King Faisal of Syria decided not to fight the French and withdrew, eventually gaining a kingdom in Iraq. Azma decided otherwise and went ahead to fight the French even with the knowledge that his forces would be outnumbered and outgunned. The French entered Syria to impose their colonial ambitions and the artificial borders agreed upon by the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1917.William Cleveland, A history of the Modern Middle East, Third Edition, p. 167. The battle was a decisive French victory, which enabled them to march to Damascus and start dividing and colonizing Syria.

[[David Henry (businessman)]]
CATEGORIES: 1888 births, 1963 deaths, Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire, New Zealand businesspeople, New Zealand knights, Scottish emigrants to New Zealand, People from Auckland, People from Midlothian

Sir David Henry, KBE (24 November 1888 - 20 August 1963) was a Scottish-born New Zealand industrialist, company director, and philanthropist.
Henry was born at Juniper Green, Midlothian, Scotland. His father, Robert Henry, was a sawmiller and on leaving school, David worked as a clerk in the Mossy Paper Mill at Colinton while attending night classes in Edinburgh, possibly at Heriot-Watt College. 
Indifferent health prompted him to emigrate to New Zealand in 1907. He worked for the Government Printer in Wellington for a brief time before moving to Christchurch, where he founded an engineering business. When the business failed he shifted to Auckland to start afresh.
He married Mary Castleton Osborne on 28 April 1915 and began working for another engineering and patents company owned by S. Oldfield and D. B. Hutton. By August of the same year, he had bought into the firm, and it was renamed Oldfield & Henry. Within four years he owned the organisation outright and it became known as D. Henry & Co. Henry expanded the business into a profitable small-scale plumbing manufacturer and supplier. 
Henry's New Zealand cousins (see Henry Family of New Zealand) had been involved in the fledgingly timbermilling industry since their arrival in New Zealand in the 1870s and in 1936 he was to play a pivotal role in the consolidation of the New Zealand timber industry through his involvement in the merger of his extended family's milling business with the afforestation company, New Zealand Perpetual Forests (a large bond selling company that had established [tpl]convert|150000|acre|ha[/tpl] of timber plantations, but had gone bankrupt). Henry struck a hard bargain in purchasing the New Zealand Perpetual Forests assets and was made the chairman and managing director of the new company for his efforts. This new company was New Zealand Forest Products, which remained New Zealand's largest industrial concern and largest company until the privatisation of Telecom New Zealand in the 1990s.
In assuming the role of New Zealand's pre-eminent industrialist, Henry was concerned with developing the future utilisation of the company’s forests. Sawmill technology for handling Pinus radiata, and the commercial manufacture of pulp and paper from this species, was reasonably undeveloped worldwide. He travelled extensively throughout the United States and Europe to find the newest processing technology and fought a protracted battle with the New Zealand Government to overcome bureaucracy. 
He was successful in convincing the government of the benefits of the company's industrialisation and in 1941 opened the first large-scale sawmill and insulating board plant at Penrose, Auckland. 
Henry also clashed with the government over its plans to nationalise the New Zealand timber industry to create an integrated state sector forest and timber manufacturing company. This battle continued until the election of a National Government in 1949.
In 1943 Sir David chose a mill site near Tokoroa, near the company’s forest plantations. He built Kinleith Mill (after a paper mill in Scotland), which was to become famous as New Zealand's largest industrial processing complex. Kinleith manufactured the first commercially produced kraft pulp in New Zealand in 1953. It was the culmination of 17 years of effort by Henry.
In 1954 he was made a KBE for his services to the New Zealand exotic timber industry. 
Henry was very involved in the community. He used his business success in Auckland to become increasingly involved with a wide range of organisations, including the Rotary Club of Auckland, the Boy Scouts’ Association, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the Auckland Manufacturers’ Association (eventually becoming national president), and he sat as an elected councillor on the Auckland City Council (from 1931–33). He was also well known for his philanthropy, endowing a forestry scholarship bearing his name in 1956 to provide overseas training for employees of New Zealand Forest Products. He also established a substantial trust for the Auckland Presbyterian Orphanages and Social Service Association (now known as Presbyterian Support). 
His wife died in 1954, but the next year, Sir David (aged 67) married Dorothy May Osborne, the younger sister of his first wife. 
Even at the age of 67, Sir David showed no interest in retiring as Chairman of New Zealand Forest Products. He continued to battle the government over industry licensing, but alarmingly also began to display increasingly erratic behaviour. This is evidenced by his conduct in 1958 when he encouraged the British pulp and paper giant Bowater Paper Corporation to make an unsuccessful takeover for New Zealand Forest Products, and he began to make uncharacteristically rash statements to the national press. Despite being ill with a heart condition, Henry continued to be active at the company, holding many meetings at his Remuera residence, during which he was known to lash out verbally.
In his history of New Zealand Forest Products, titled "A Hundred Million Trees", Brian Healy said "Sir David Henry lacked warmth and humour in his working relations and tended to be abrupt and demanding with his subordinates. Yet he was a fluent and persuasive speaker whose self-assurance, business acumen and tenacity were vital in enabling New Zealand Forest Products to overcome enormous barriers and to develop into one of the country’s largest industrial enterprises."

Duke University graduate students Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea in 1979 and it was established in 1980.From Usenet to CoWebs: interacting with social information spaces, Christopher Lueg, Danyel Fisher, Springer (2003), ISBN 1-85233-532-7, ISBN 978-1-85233-532-8 Users read and post messages (called articles or posts, and collectively termed news) to one or more categories, known as newsgroups. Usenet resembles a bulletin board system (BBS) in many respects, and is the precursor to Internet forums that are widely used today. Usenet can be superficially regarded as a hybrid between email and web forums. Discussions are threaded, as with web forums and BBSes, though posts are stored on the server sequentially.
One notable difference between a BBS or web forum and Usenet is the absence of a central server and dedicated administrator. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers that store and forward messages to one another in so-called news feeds. Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by a commercial usenet provider, their Internet service provider, university, employer, or their own server.

Elmer J. Fudd/Egghead is a fictional cartoon character and one of the most famous Looney Tunes characters, and the de facto archenemy of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself).Elmer Fudd at Toonopedia His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws, so "Watch the road, Rabbit," is replaced with "Watch the woad, wabbit!" Elmer's signature catchphrase is, "Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits", as well as his trademark laughter, "huh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh".
The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones' masterpiece What's Opera, Doc? (one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs, though he felt bad about it), the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville, and the "Hunting Trilogy" of "Rabbit Season/Duck Season" shorts (Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning, and Duck!

[[Particle accelerator]]
CATEGORIES: Particle accelerators

A particle accelerator is a device that uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles to high speeds and to contain them in well-defined beams.
Large accelerators are best known for their use in particle physics as colliders (e.g. the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, RHIC, and Tevatron). Other kinds of particle accelerators are used in a large variety of applications, including particle therapy for oncological purposes, and as synchrotron light sources for the study of condensed matter physics.  There are currently more than 30,000 accelerators in operation around the world.[tpl]cite web|last=Witman|first=Sarah|title=Ten things you might not know about particle accelerators|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2014/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-particle-accelerators|work=Symmetry Magazine|publisher=Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl]
There are two basic classes of accelerators: electrostatic and oscillating field accelerators. 
Electrostatic accelerators use static electric fields to accelerate particles. A small-scale example of this class is the cathode ray tube in an ordinary old television set. Other examples are the Cockcroft–Walton generator and the Van de Graaff generator. The achievable kinetic energy for particles in these devices is limited by electrical breakdown.  
Oscillating field accelerators, on the other hand, use radio frequency electromagnetic fields to accelerate particles, and circumvent the breakdown problem. This class, which was first developed in the 1920s, is the basis for all modern accelerator concepts and large-scale facilities.
Rolf Widerøe, Gustav Ising, Leó Szilárd, Donald Kerst, and Ernest Lawrence are considered pioneers of this field, conceiving and building the first operational linear particle accelerator,Pedro Waloschek (ed.): The Infancy of Particle Accelerators: Life and Work of Rolf Wideröe, Vieweg, 1994 the betatron, and the cyclotron.
Because colliders can give evidence of the structure of the subatomic world, accelerators were commonly referred to as atom smashers in the 20th century. Despite the fact that most accelerators (but not ion facilities) actually propel subatomic particles, the term persists in popular usage when referring to particle accelerators in general.

In 1998, the National Association of Athletic Development Directors named him Fundraiser of the Year.utsports.com - Mike Hamilton
On June 7, 2011, Mike Hamilton resigned from his position as the Athletic Director at the University of Tennessee following months of pressure stemming from numerous issues including sanctions levied against the Tennessee basketball program and numerous head coaching changes in the school's major sports. Hamilton's poor leadership is viewed by many as the main reason the Vols football program hit an all time low during his tenure. Hamilton's duties as an AD were tested when he decided to fire longtime Tennessee football coach Phillip Fulmer. Fulmer was one of Tennessee's winningest head coaches at the time of his dismissal and although many called for his firing after two losing seasons in four years there were also many in his support. Hamilton chose Lane Kiffin as Tennessee's next head coach in December 2008. Many did not believe Kiffin to be the best hire as there were other highly rated potential candidates at the time not to mention Kiffin's controversial history with past coaching jobs. Hamilton's decision would be disastrous as after only one season at Tennessee Kiffin resigned to take the same job at the University of Southern California. Hamilton controversially hired Derek Dooley following Kiffin's departure, despite his losing record at Louisiana Tech. The pressure would come to a boil in March 2011 when in the middle of the NCAA's investigation into sanctions against basketball coach Bruce Pearl and but one day before the team was scheduled to face the Michigan Wolverines in the second round of the 2011 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, Hamilton announced that Pearl's status as coach going into the game was not certain and at season's end he would be evaluated. Hamilton was scrutinized for making this statement before the team played in the tournament as the pressure it would put on the team may have been the deciding factor in their lopsided 30 point loss to the Wolverines the following day. On the Monday following the game Pearl was dismissed from Tennessee and not soon after Hamilton announced his resignation. Even though Mike Hamilton should not have received any "buyout" with a resignation, University of Tennessee Knoxville Chancellor Jimmy Cheek provided him over $1.3 million in severance, to the confusion and surprise of many.http://www.govolsxtra.com/news/2011/jun/07/john-adams-buyout-just-resigning-really/

Sebastian Hardie were Australia's first symphonic rock band. They formed in Sydney in 1967 as Sebastian Hardie Blues Band but dropped the 'Blues Band' reference when they became pop-oriented. By 1973 they developed a more progressive rock style, and later performed as Windchase, but disbanded in 1977. An early member of Sebastian Hardie was Jon English (vocals, rhythm guitar), who starred as Judas Iscariot in the Australian version of the stage musical Jesus Christ Superstar in 1972, he subsequently had a solo career as a singer, actor and playwright. A later member, Mario Millo (lead guitar, mandolin, vocals) became a multi-award winner for his television and movie music.
Sebastian Hardie's other early members included Graham Ford (lead guitar), Peter Plavsic (bass guitar) and his brother Alex Plavsic (drums). After English and Ford had left, the Plavsic brothers were joined by Millo and Toivo Pilt (keyboards). With their addition, Sebastian Hardie developed extended progressive rock tracks to become a symphonic rock group before they released their definitive album Four Moments in 1975, which peaked at No. 13 on the National albums chart. They followed with a second album Windchase in 1976, but it had less chart success. Millo and Pilt formed the band, Windchase, to release Symphinity in 1977, it was a heavier jazz-fusion album but didn't have chart success and they disbanded.

Ron Eglash (born December 25, 1958 in Chestertown, MD) is an American cyberneticist, professor of science and technology studies at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and author widely known for his work in the field of ethnomathematics, which aims to study the diverse relationships between mathematics and culture.  
His research includes the use of fractal patterns in African architecture, art, and religion, and the relationships between indigenous cultures and modern technology, such as that between Native American cultural and spiritual practices and cybernetics.  He holds a bachelor's degree in cybernetics and a master's in systems engineering both at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a Ph.D. in history of consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  A Fulbright fellowship enabled his postdoctoral field research on African ethnomathematics, which was later published in the book African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design.
Dr. Eglash has also conducted studies in teaching children math and computing through simulations of indigenous and vernacular cultural practices. He explains that the simulations do not impose math externally, but rather translate the mathematical ideas already present in the cultural practices to their equivalent form in school-taught math.  Examples include transformational geometry in cornrow braiding, spiral arcs in graffiti, least common multiples in percussion rhythms, and analytic geometry in Native American beadwork.   His approach is one of many attempts to draw the inspiration to learn out of students' own cultural backgrounds.  
He also studies social justice issues as they manifest in the practice of science and technology, ranging from the ethnic identity of “nerds” to the so-called appropriation of science and technology by groups disempowered on the bases of race, class, gender.  Another branch of this research explores how the “bottom-up” egalitarian principles found in many indigenous cultures could be applied to modern society in fields from economics to political science.
He has served as a senior lecturer in comparative studies at Ohio State University, and is currently a professor at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he has taught courses on science and social theory, the history of information technology, and a design studio for the Product Design and Innovation program.

[[Reverse osmosis]]
CATEGORIES: Water treatment, Water desalination, Filters, Water technology, Membrane technology

Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that uses a semipermeable membrane.  This membrane technology is not properly a filtration method.  In reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure, a colligative property, that is driven by chemical potential, a thermodynamic parameter.  Reverse osmosis can remove many types of molecules and ions from solutions, and is used in both industrial processes and the production of potable water.  The result is that the solute is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure solvent is allowed to pass to the other side. To be "selective", this membrane should not allow large molecules or ions through the pores (holes), but should allow smaller components of the solution (such as the solvent) to pass freely.
In the normal osmosis process, the solvent naturally moves from an area of low solute concentration (high water potential), through a membrane, to an area of high solute concentration (low water potential). The movement of a pure solvent is driven to reduce the free energy of the system by equalizing solute concentrations on each side of a membrane,  generating osmotic pressure. Applying an external pressure to reverse the natural flow of pure solvent, thus, is reverse osmosis. The process is similar to other membrane technology applications. However, key differences are found between reverse osmosis and filtration. The predominant removal mechanism in membrane filtration is straining, or size exclusion, so the process can theoretically achieve perfect exclusion of particles regardless of operational parameters such as influent pressure and concentration. Moreover, reverse osmosis involves a diffusive mechanism, so that separation efficiency is dependent on solute concentration, pressure, and water flux rate.Crittenden, John; Trussell, Rhodes; Hand, David; Howe, Kerry and Tchobanoglous, George. Water Treatment Principles and Design, Edition 2. John Wiley and Sons. New Jersey. 2005 ISBN 0-471-11018-3 Reverse osmosis is most commonly known for its use in drinking water purification from seawater, removing the salt and other effluent materials from the water molecules.

[[Terpstra]]

CATEGORIES: Surnames of Frisian origin

The surname “Terpstra” derives its origin from the North Eastern region of the Netherlands in an area called Friesland. Friesland is the largest of the Dutch provinces (if one includes areas of water;) but in terms of land area only, it is the third largest province. Most of Friesland is on the mainland, but it also includes a number of West Frisian islands, including Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog, which are connected to the mainland by ferry. The province's highest point is at 45 meters above sea level, on the island of Vlieland.
Terpstra is a toponymic, location, or habitation name.  These types of names derive from the inhabited location associated with the person given that name.  Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as: homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds or cottages.  One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement.  The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different time-periods, locations, or with being used with certain other elements.
In the Friesian dialects there are two different definitions of the word “terp.”  The first definition of a “terp” from the more modern Friesian dialect means: “an artificial dwelling hill” (plural “terpen”.)  The second definition is in the Old Frisian dialect and means: "village".  The latter half of the surname “stra” means “of the” or “from the” and is used in various other surnames as well. 
Historical Frisian settlements were built on artificial terpen which were up to 15 m in height to be safe from floods in periods of rising sea levels.  The first terp-building period began around 500 BC, and a second dated from 200 BC to 50 BC.  Then, in the mid-3rd century, the rise of sea level was so dramatic that many low lying areas were deserted, and settlers were only able to return around 400 AD.  A third and final terp-building period began around 700 AD (Old Frisian times).  This ended with the invention of the dike somewhere around 1200 AD.  During the 18th and 19th centuries, many terps were destroyed to use the fertile soil they contained to fertilize farm fields. 
The greater part of the villages built on terps have names ending in -um, -heem, or -hiem, meaning farm-yard, or grounds.  However, there are a few village names in Friesland ending with -terp as well (e.g. Ureterp), referring not to a dwelling mound but merely to the Old Frisian word for village. For these places, the first element of the toponym is quite often a person's name or is simply describing the environmental features of the settlement.
The Low Countries, such as the Netherlands, were great centers of heraldry in medieval times. Coats of arms in the Netherlands were not controlled by an official heraldic system like the two in the United Kingdom, nor were they used solely by noble families. Any person could develop and use a coat of arms if they wished to do so, provided they did not usurp someone else's arms, and historically, this right was enshrined in Roman Dutch law.  As a result, many merchant families had coats of arms even though they were not members of the nobility. These are sometimes referred to as “Burgher Arms,” and it is thought that most arms of this type were adopted while the Netherlands was a republic (1581–1806).  In some regions even peasants sometimes bore arms. In Switzerland 14th century arms of farmers are known, but they are rare and did not become numerous until the 17th century. This was the case as well as in Lower Saxony, Frisia (Friesland) and Tyrol, where farmers had more personal freedoms. This heraldic tradition was also exported to the erstwhile Dutch colonies.  Dutch heraldry is characterized by its simple and rather sober style, and in this sense, is closer to its medieval origins than the elaborate styles which developed in other heraldic traditions
The Terpstra Family coat of arms has various aspects that refer to its origins and regional history.  This coat of arms can be broken into two parts: the shield and the crest.
When describing the shield, one must first note the tincture, or background colors of royal blue and white. These colors are representative of the waters of the Northern Sea which were an ever-present threat in ancient days. They were both nurturing and destructive at the same time to the early Friesians.  As for the designs on the shield itself: in the lower right field there is an example of a terp; An artificial mound rising above the flood waters.  This field is then separated from the upper right of the escutcheon by a downward horizontal white field with three red “Crosslet crosses”.  This heraldic cross is made from four Latin Crosses arranged at right-angles to each other, with their tops pointing north, south, east and west. The Crosslet cross is a symbol for the world evangelism of the Gospels, which gives it an alternative name as well: the Mission Cross.  Another common interpretation of these types of crosses is that it represents the four evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  To this day, like the evangelists, the Terpstras seem to spread themselves few and far between.  It has become exceedingly rare to find more than one family with this surname in any given area outside the homeland.  The burning castle in the upper left of the shield is a nod to the fact that the geographical region of Friesland has been conquered by various overlords during the centuries past such as the Roman Empire, the Frankish tribes (which later became the Merovingian and the Carolingian Dynasties), the Holy Roman Empire, the Duchy of Burgundy, the Spanish Empire, and even the Nazis in World War II.  Throughout it all, the Friesians were able to maintain their own cultural dialects and identity unlike most other occupied regions who find themselves under the same situations.  The occupiers all have left; the Friesians have remained relatively unchanged.
Therefore, it also seems appropriate that the family motto is “Rising Above the Tides” as this makes reference to both literally rising above the waters of the encroaching North Sea, and the political sways of the European theater. 
On the top of the shield rests the second part of the family’s coat of arms.  This is broken into three separate parts: the helmet, the torse or wreath, and the crest.  First, the Terpstra family, coming from a commoner’s background, utilizes a tilting helmet or jousting helmet reserved for non-nobles. Historically, the helmet itself was not specifically granted as an achievement of arms, but was naturally assumed by appropriate rank as a matter of "inherent right" for those who have fought in regional conflict, so a helmet with torse and mantling would not be misplaced even above a shield which had no crest to place above it. Above the helmet is the torse with the family colors of blue and white interchanging.  This in turn is topped by a crest of wheat in recognition of the region’s history of farming as its primary means of livelihood.
Terpstra is a surname of Frisian origin, and may refer to:

The Utah Division of the former Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW) is a rail line that connects Grand Junction, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah (formerly Ogden) in the Western United States. It is now incorporated into the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) system as its Green River and Provo Subdivisions,Agreement Between Union Pacific Railroad Company and Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, effective February 1, 2000 (includes a list of subdivisions from the first post-merger timetable in 1998) forming a portion of the Denver-Nevada Central Corridor. Daily passenger service is provided by Amtrak's California Zephyr, and the BNSF Railway and Utah Railway have trackage rights over the line.
The line dates back to the early 1880s, when the predecessors of the D&RGW completed a [tpl]RailGauge|3ft|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gauge line through the Royal Gorge, over Marshall Pass, through the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, across the Utah desert, and over Soldier Summit. It was rebuilt to standard gauge in 1890, and has since remained a through line, often serving as parts of larger networks including the Gould transcontinental system, Southern Pacific, and now the Union Pacific.
The division also included a number of branch lines, the longest being the Marysvale Branch through the Sevier Valley.

The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), is a multinational treaty for the purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement. The agreement aims to establish an international legal framework for targeting counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet, and would create a new governing body outside existing forums, such as the World Trade Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or the United Nations.
The agreement was signed in October 2011 by Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States.[tpl]cite news |author=Jason Walsh |title=Europe's Internet revolt: Protesters see threats in antipiracy treaty |date=11 February 2012 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/0211/Europe-s-Internet-revolt-protesters-see-threats-in-antipiracy-treaty |work=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=9 April 2012[/tpl] In 2012, Mexico, the European Union and 22 countries which are member states of the European Union signed as well.[tpl]cite news |author=Olivia Solon |title=The EU signs up to Acta, but French MEP quits in protest |date=26 January 2012 |url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-01/26/eu-signs-up-to-acta |work=Wired UK |accessdate=9 April 2012 [/tpl] One signatory (Japan) has ratified (formally approved) the agreement, which would come into force in countries that ratified it after ratification by six countries.
Industrial groups with interests in copyright, trademarks and other types of intellectual property,   said that ACTA was a response to "the increase in global trade of counterfeit goods and pirated copyright protected works".  Organizations such as the Motion Picture Association of America and International Trademark Association are understood to have had a significant influence over the ACTA agenda.[tpl]citation  |author=Monica Horten |title= A Copyright Masquerade - How Corporate Lobbying Threatens Online Freedoms |pages= 41–65|url= http://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/a-copyright-masquerade[/tpl]
Organisations representing citizens and non-governmental interests argued that ACTA could infringe fundamental rights including freedom of expression and privacy. ACTA has also been criticised by Doctors Without Borders for endangering access to medicines in developing countries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/sites/default/files/MSF_assets/Access/Docs/Access_Briefing_ACTABlankCheque_ENG_2012.pdf |title=A Blank Cheque For Abuse — The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and its Impact on Access to Medicines |format=PDF |date=February 2012 |publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières |accessdate=3 July 2012 [/tpl] The secret nature of negotiations has excluded civil society groups, developing countries and the general public from the agreement's negotiation process and it has been described as policy laundering by critics including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Entertainment Consumers Association.
The signature of the EU and many of its member states resulted in widespread protests across Europe.  The  European Parliament's  rapporteur Kader Arif resigned. His replacement, British MEP David Martin, recommended that the Parliament should reject ACTA, stating: "The intended benefits of this international agreement are far outweighed by the potential threats to civil liberties". On 4 July 2012, the European Parliament declined its consent, effectively rejecting it,  478 votes to 39,  and 165 abstentions.[tpl]cite news |author= Monica Horten |title=Wow what a scorcher!

Sonoma Plaza is the central plaza in the former town of Sonoma (pueblo de Sonoma, in spanish), now known as Sonoma, California.  The town is centered around this plaza,  the largest plaza in California. This plaza is surrounded by many historical buildings, including the Mission San Francisco Solano, Captain Salvador Vallejo's Casa Grande, the Presidio of Sonoma, the Blue Wing Inn, and the Toscano Hotel.  In the middle of the plaza, Sonoma's early 20th-century city hall, at the plaza's center and still in use, was designed and built with four identical sides in order not to offend the merchants on any one side of the plaza. The plaza is a National Historic Landmark and still serves as the town's focal point, hosting many community festivals and drawing tourists all year round.  It provides a central tourist attraction.  It is also the location of the Farmer's Market, held every Tuesday in the summer. Sonoma City Hall was dedicated in 1908.
This location was where the Bear Flag Revolt took place in 1846, which led to the Mexican-American War.[tpl]Cite web | last =  Cox | first = Robert A. | title = Sonoma Plaza | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | publisher = National Park Service | date = August 1, 1973 | url = http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/75000489.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 25 May 2012[/tpl]
"For many years, the site in Sonoma Plaza where the bear flag originally had been raised went unmarked. Largely through the efforts of the Native Sons of the Golden West, the legislature appropriated $5,000 for a monument to be placed there.

Francis La Fontaine, or Topeah (Miami: "frost on leaves" [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=42524370 | title=Chief Francis Topeah Lafontaine | publisher=Find-A-Grave Memorial | date=Sep 29, 2009 | accessdate=December 5, 2012 | author=Patee, Annis Jean Hite[/tpl]) (1810 – 1847) was the last principal chief of the unified Miami tribe, and oversaw the split into the Western and Eastern Miami tribes. 
La Fontaine's grandfather, Peter LaFontaine, was a French trader from Fort Detroit who came to Kekionga in 1776.  He arrived with Charles Beaubien, and both men married Miami women and declared their loyalty to the Miami.Poinsatte, 14  In 1828, at age 18, La Fontaine became the chief of his Miami village.Federal Writers' Project, 315  The same year, he married Catherine, the daughter of Chief Jean Baptiste Richardville.Chief's House and Miami Interpretation, Historic Forks of the Wabash. Website accessed 11 July 2010.  Richardville and La Fontaine worked together on a treaty in 1840 which removed half of the Miami nation to an area west of the Mississippi River.
Chief Richardville died in 1841, and Chief La Fontaine became the new principal chief of the Miami.  He moved his family into Richardville's house at The Forks Of The Wabash, which doubled as the tribal headquarters.[tpl]cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080704121309/http://www.historicforks.org/today/newsletter/history_of_the_forks.html | title=The History of Historic Forks of the Wabash | work =  Historic Forks of the Wabash  | accessdate=December 5, 2012[/tpl]
In 1846, the Miami nation was forcibly split.  Although the terms of the treaty allowed La Fontaine to stay in Indiana with the Eastern tribe, he first travelled with the Western tribe to Kansas.  On his return trip, he died in Lafayette, Indiana.  Speculation exists that he may have been poisoned by a member of the Western Miami tribe who viewed La Fontaine with suspicion.Federal Writers' Project, 198  La Fontaine's body was returned to the Forks of the Wabash, and his remains lie in Mt. Calvary Cemetery near Huntington, Indiana.Allison, 293
Catherine La Fontaine died two years later.  Francis and Catherine had seven children: Esther (married John Zahn), Frances (married George Gawn), Archangel (married Chris Engleman), Louis, John, Joe, and Tom.  The youngest of the children were placed in the care of the Roman Catholic Church, and the sons were educated at the University of Notre Dame as payment for a mortgage Francis had granted the school to keep it financially stable.  The family maintained ownership of the house until 1941, and it is currently maintained by Historic Forks of the Wabash, Inc.

Backmasking is a recording technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through phonetic reversal may be unintentional.
Backmasking was popularised by the Beatles, who used backward instrumentation on their 1966 album Revolver.[tpl]cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |title='More Popular Than Jesus': The Beatles and the Religious Far Right |journal=Popular Music |date=October 1987 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=313–326 |doi=10.1017/S0261143000002348[/tpl] Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic and satiric effect, on both analogue and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of explicit songs.
Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations from Christian groups of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent rock musicians, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments.Billiter, Bill (April 28, 1982).

[[Abstinence]]

CATEGORIES: Asceticism, Human sexuality, Drug rehabilitation, Twelve-step programs

Abstinence is a self-enforced restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure. Most frequently, the term refers to sexual abstinence,  or abstinence from alcohol or food. The practice can arise from religious prohibitions and practical considerations.
Abstinence may also refer to drugs. For example you can abstain from smoking.
Abstinence has diverse forms. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in fasting. In the twelve-step program of Overeaters Anonymous abstinence is the term for refraining from compulsive eating, akin in meaning to sobriety for alcoholics. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of repression. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. Freud termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities, "sublimation".

[[Boston baked beans]]
CATEGORIES: Massachusetts culture

Boston baked beans are a variety of baked beans, typically sweetened with molasses or maple syrup and flavored with salt pork or bacon.
Native Americans had made corn bread and baked beans. The Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony learned these recipes in the early 1620s, and likely added barley to the corn meal to invent brown bread. The Triangular Trade of slaves in the 1700s helped to make Boston an exporter of rum, which is produced by the distillation of fermented molasses. At that time, molasses was added to local baked bean recipes, creating Boston Baked Beans. In colonial New England, baked beans were traditionally cooked on Saturdays and left in the brick ovens overnight. On Sundays, the beans were still hot, allowing people to indulge in a hot meal and still comply with Sabbath restrictions. Brown bread and baked beans were a popular meal on Saturdays and Sundays in Massachusetts until at least the 1930s.

[[Edward Knight (King's Men)]]

CATEGORIES: Theatre in England, British drama, People associated with Shakespeare, 17th-century English people, Year of birth unknown, Year of death unknown

Edward Knight (fl. 1613 – 1637) was the prompter (then called the "book-keeper" or "book-holder") of the King's Men, the acting company that performed the plays of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Fletcher, and other playwrights of Jacobean and Caroline drama.
In English Renaissance theatre, the prompter managed the company's performances, ensuring that they went according to plan; he also supervised and maintained the troupe's dramatic manuscripts, its "playbooks." It was in this sense that the prompter "held" and "kept" the "books" of the company. And when censorship problems arose, the prompter had to resolve them.
Nothing is known of Knight's personal history; he is known only through his professional activities. Prior to his service with the King's Men, he functioned as prompter for a competing company, Prince Charles's Men; he witnessed a contract between Philip Henslowe and the actors in March 1616.Grace Ioppolo, Dramatists and Their Manuscripts in the Age of Shakespeare, Jonson, Middleton, and Heywood, London, Routledge, 2004; p. 76. After some years with the King's Men, he was apparently regarded as a key member of the company's supporting staff: on 27 December 1624, Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, issued a roster of 21 "musicians and other necessary attendants" of the King's Men who could not be arrested or "pressed for soldiers" without the permission of either Herbert or the Lord Chamberlain, then William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Knight's name is first on the list. (The 16th name on the list is Anthony Knight, perhaps a relative.)F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 268, 391.
Knight prepared the company's play texts for production, adding stage directions, cues for offstage sounds, and other necessary information to turn an author's or scribe's manuscript into a promptbook. Several play manuscripts in Knight's hand survive — for Beggars' Bush, Bonduca, The Faithful Friends, and The Honest Man's Fortune. (Knight's manuscript for Bonduca is not a promptbook but a presentation MS. In the MSS. of both Bonduca and The Fautfhul Friends, Knight leaves gaps because he is transcribing the author's drafts, the "foul papers," and sometimes cannot read the defective texts.)Ioppolo, pp. 76, 135. Knight's job of annotating manuscripts for use as promptbooks throws light on practical aspects of the stagecraft of the era, and also the censorship problems that plagued the dramatists and actors. Philip Massinger's authorial MS. of his Believe as You List reveals official censorship in action, and bears notes and revisions in Knight's hand.
(In the Believe as You List MS., Knight marked the actors' entrances three of four lines prior to their first speaking; they needed the time to traverse the large stage of the Globe Theatre.)Andrew Gurr, The Shakespeare Company 1594–1642, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 122.
A second document from the hand of Sir Henry Herbert, addressed personally to Knight, is especially notable. On 21 October 1633, Herbert returned the MS. of The Woman's Prize to Knight, ordering him to do a better job of removing "oaths, prophaness, and publique ribaldrye", and threatening Knight with consequences if he doesn't do better: "you will answer it at your perill."
Shakespeare scholars have devoted a good measure of attention to the specifics of Knight's practice and his handwriting, looking for insight into the effect Knight may have had on the details of Shakespeare's texts.Paul Werstein, "Close Contrivers: Nameless Collaborators in Early Modern London Plays," in: The Elizabethan Theatre XV, C. E. McGee and A. L. Magnusson, eds., Toronto, P. D. Meany, 2002; pp. 3-20. "The 1634 Quarto of Two Noble Kinsmen, printed from a manuscript which apparently reflects a revival of 1625/6, contains stage directions probably penned by Knight."Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, John Jowett, William Montgomery, William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion, New York, W.W. Norton, 1997;  p. 22. At the extreme, it has been suggested that Knight was "the virtual editor of the First Folio on behalf of Heminge and Condell."John Dover Wilson, "A New Way with Shakespeare's Texts: An Introduction for Lay Readers, IV," in: Shakespeare Survey II, Allardyce Nicoll, ed., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1958; p. 82.
Two manuscripts in Knight's hand, of The Court Secret by James Shirley and The Country Captain by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, date from the 1638–40 period; they are the last signs of his activity.Gurr, p. 121.
(The censored manuscript of the Fletcher/Massinger collaboration Sir John van Olden Barnavelt contains prompter's notes, but they are not in Knight's hand. The King's Men had another prompter in Knight's era, a man named Thomas Vincent; even less is known about Vincent than about Knight.)

After a 1946 outbreak of a rickettsial-type disease at an apartment complex in Kew Gardens, Queens, an investigation was performed to identify the source of the infections. The incinerators in the buildings were not operated on a daily basis, leading to a buildup in food waste and attracting mice that were rampant throughout the building. The Mus musculus mice were found to be carrying mites, identified as the house mouse mite, Allodermanyssus sanguineus. Self-trained entomologist Charles Pomerantz asked permission to search the site and found the mites at various sites throughout the building, with blood-engorged mites found near chutes leading to the incinerator. The mites were collected and brought to a laboratory of the United States Public Health Service, which found in the mites an organism that had also been isolated from the mice, and from the blood of individuals infected with the disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Greenberg M, Pellitteri OJ, Jellison WL |title=Rickettsialpox-A Newly Recognized Rickettsial Disease : III.

Louis Ventenat (1765 - 1794) was a French Catholic priest and naturalist born in Limoges. He was the brother of botanist Étienne Pierre Ventenat (1757-1808).
Ventenat was a member of a mission led by Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux (1737-1793) in a search for explorer Jean-François de La Pérouse (1741-1788), of whom there was no news of for five years. Ventenat served as chaplain and naturalist on the expedition. In 1793 he and other members of the expedition were captured by Dutch authorities, and imprisoned in the Dutch East Indies. In captivity he became gravely ill, but was able to obtain leave to the Île-de-France, where he died soon afterwards.
Ventenat's botanical collections were preserved by Benjamin Delessert (1773-1784) at an herbarium in Geneva. Dutch botanist Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel (1811-1871) dedicated the botanical species Peperomia ventenatii in his honor.

The 10.4 cm Feldkanone M. 15 was a heavy field gun used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. Guns captured or turned over to Italy as reparations after World War I were taken into Italian service as the Cannone da 105/32 and were bored out to 105 mm to fit Italian ammunition. It was one of the principal Italian long-range guns in World War II and saw service in North Africa and Russia. Those few guns that were captured from the Italians by the Germans after the Italian surrender in 1943 were designated as 10.5 cm Kanone 320(i). It doesn't seem to have seen service with any of the Austro-Hungarian successor states after World War I.
For transport it broke down into the customary two loads. And it carried the customary two seats on the gun shield for crewmen. All data given herein is for the Italian version of the gun.

"Crying Time" is a song from 1964 written by country music artist Buck Owens.
Owens recorded the original version of his song and released it as the B side to the 45 single "I've Got a Tiger By the Tail" in 1964, Capitol 5336, but it failed to reach the music charts. A cover version of "Crying Time" was then recorded by R&B singer Ray Charles, and his version proved to be a hit. Featuring backing vocals by the Jack Halloran Singers and The Raelettes, the song reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in February 1966.Whitburn, Joel (1996). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition (Billboard Publications) Charles' version of the song also peaked at number five on the R&B chart and spent three weeks at number one on the easy listening chart.Hyatt, Wesley (1999). The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits (Billboard Publications) In the United Kingdom, the song reached number 50 on the British pop chart. Chart Stats - Ray Charles - Cryin' Time In addition, Charles' version of "Crying Time" won two Grammy Awards in 1967, in the categories Best R&B Recording and Best R&B Solo Performance.
Charles intended his version of Owens' song to be a tribute to the country music style he appreciated (Charles had successfully covered other country music songs in the past, such as "I Can't Stop Loving You"). He was quoted as saying that he didn't record "Crying Time" and other country songs written by Owens "out of disrespect sic for Buck. I'm crazy about Buck. But I heard something that fit my style. The key was keeping my style while watching my style work in different ways."

Ray Charles and Barbra Streisand performed the song as a duet on her 1973 album Barbra Streisand...And Other Musical Instruments. This cover was featured in the episode, "The Glass Is Always Cleaner", of the NBC drama series Las Vegas.  Streisand also included a solo version of the song on her 1974 album ButterFly.
Dutch singer Andre Hazes recorded it for his 1989 blues-album Dit Is Wat Ik Wil (This Is What I Want) as Jammer (It's a pity), a Jan Akkerman-assisted warning for earth-pollution. It was released as a single, backed with a non-translated version of Working in a Coal Mine.
Wanda Jackson and Elvis Costello recorded a version which appears on Jackson's 2003 album Heart Trouble.
 Connie Francis recorded the song during a 1989 Muscle Shoals session.
Victor Wood covered this song in the album Mr. Lonely.
Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen recorded a live version on the 1974 album Live from Deep in the Heart of Texas.

[[Luys d'Averçó]]

CATEGORIES: 1410s deaths, Catalan writers, Medieval Catalan-language writers, Catalan politicians, Year of birth unknown

Luys d'Averçó or Luis de Aversó (c.1350–1412x15) was a Catalan politician, naval financier, and man of letters. His magnum opus, the Torcimany, is one of the most important medieval Catalan-language grammars to modern historians.Its title means "Interpreter" or "Translator", from the Arabic turjiman, akin to Spanish truchimán, see John Forster, trans. (1878), The Chronicle of James I of Aragon, Glossary, 709. Its first modern edition was published in 1956 by Josep Maria Casas Homs for the Instituto Miguel de Cervantes. His name is spelled Lluís d'Averçó or d'Aversó in modern orthography. 
Averçó was born to a family of naval shipowners in Barcelona in the middle of the fourteenth century.For a biographical sketch of Averçó, see Martí de Riquer i Morera (1964), Història de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 1 (Barcelona: Edicions Ariel), 560. He continued in the family business and profited from it financially all his life. He appears to be well-trained in law, for he participated in the municipal government of Barcelona throughout his life, being a councillor (conseller) in 1395 and again in 1403. During the interregnum of 1410–12 he was charged by the Parliament of Catalonia with arbitrating some disputes amongst the citizens of Lleida. He later represented Barcelona on a diplomatic mission to Majorca. His diverse interests economic, literary, military, and political brought him favour with the monarchs John I ("the Lover of Elegance") and Martin ("the Humane"). 
No poems by Averçó survive, though his reputation in the poetic world of his time is undeniable.For Averçó's poetry, see Riquer, 560. He and Jaume March II persuaded John I to inaugurate the jocs florals at Barcelona and establish a Consistori de la Gaya Sciènça there. On 20 February 1393 John named Jaume and Averçó the first judges of the Consistori's contests (jocs). On 12 August 1399 their position was reaffirmed by king Martin. Averçó's poetic reputation is further established by his Torcimany, which contain a wealth of information for composing poetry in Catalan. 
Torcimany survives in a single autograph in the library of the Escorial.It has been described as "a manual to help Catalan poets fake a better usage of Provençal" by J. M. Sobré (1982), "Ausiàs March, the Myth of Language, and the Troubadour Tradition", Hispanic Review, 50:3 (Summer), 330. For a fuller treatment of its relationship to the "language of the troubadours", see Mark D. Johnston (1981), "The Translation of the Troubadour Tradition in the Torcimany of Lluis d'Averçó", Philological Quarterly, 60:2 (Spring), pp. 151–167, and José Romeu Figueras (1954), "El cantar paralelístico en Cataluña: sus relaciones con el de Galicia y Portugal y el de Castilla", Anuario musical, 9, 18–25, 35–36. Its diffusion was almost null, its influence equally so, and its citation nonexistent. Not even Jaume March's Libre de concordances, which served the same purpose—a dictionary of rhymes (diccionari de rimes)—as the appendix of Averçó's Torcimany, shows any evidence of cross-fertilisation or influence. The two poets, who knew each other personally, wrote two similar but independent works. Torcimany cannot be confidently dated beyond the final third of the century. It is divided into three sections, the first on the basic concepts of grammar, the second (del trobar, "on composition") on the genres (dictats) of poetry, and the third on more difficult aspects of grammar and rhetoric, such as compàs (rhythm).In part one, Averçó discusses letters, graphics, diphthongs, syllables, and accents, among other things. He lists eleven main genres in the second: the vers, canso, sirventes, dansa, descort, tenso, partimen, pastorela, retroencha, planh, and escondig. He also differentiates the bordó (line) from the cobla (stanza) and delineates the various vices (vicis) that poets can commit. In the third part he deals with consonance, rhyme, declension, nouns, tense, genre, and person. The third part itself is divided into sections (Riquer, 561). 
Torcimany is not too different from the Compendi of Joan de Castellnou or the Flors del gay saber of Guilhem Molinier.According to Robert Archer (1991), "Tradition, Genre, Ethics and Politics in Ausiàs March's maldit", Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, 68:3 (July), 376, the Torcimany is based on the Leys d'amors of the Consistori de Tolosa, of which the Flors is one redaction. The dictionary of rhymes with which it ends, however, is unique to it; and Averçó does not appear to have had access to the Donatz proensals of Uc Faidit. He appears to have compiled his dictionary from memory and probably for this reason he includes words that would be difficult to employ in the type of verse he seeks to enable. Generally his words have Catalan endings, but a good portion are clearly Occitan, the language of the troubadours. A few on top of that are Castilian or Aragonese, which he clarifies with their Catalan equivalents. These Castilianisms are also unnecessary for Catalan poetry, but Averçó was fixed upon extending his rhymary.Riquer, 562, explains the odd choices Averçó made for his dictionary. Among the Castilianisms he notes padre, madre, pulga, risa, esquina, perro, lomo, libra, rota, escutxa, serrà, lutxa, and etxà. Some of these are given Catalanised spellings (i.e. ch→tx).

[[Frank Smith (D.C. Council)]]
CATEGORIES: Washington, D.C. City Council members, Living people, 1942 births

Frank Smith, Jr. (born September 17, 1942), is a civil rights activist and politician in Washington, D.C. Born in Newnan, Georgia, he attended Morehouse College where he developed his appetite for activism.  In 1960, he participated in the Rich's Department Store boycotts in Atlanta; and almost at the same time he was working with other students to establish the Student NonViolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).  A founding member of SNCC, he is recognized by his SNCC peers as the first SNCC worker sent into Mississippi to register voters.  Based in Holly Springs, Mississippi, he worked in some of the most brutal and racist counties in Mississippi.  He was also one of the few SNCC workers  employed in the original HeadStart program.  Working with the Child Development Group of Mississippi (CGDM), his Headstart Program was based in Jacksonville, Mississippi, in the heart of the  Mississippi Delta.
Frank worked with native Mississippi sharecroppers who had been evicted from their homes when they requested a pay raise in the men’s salaries from a flat rate of $6 day to $1.25 an hour.  The sharecroppers, Frank and his first wife, Jean Smith, purchased land, lived in tents where they were regular and ongoing targets for the plantation owner and friends during the year when they built housing, and established one of the first (and only) black cooperative communities in Mississippi—Strike City.   
As part of Freedom Summer, Frank Smith and Frank Soracco, another SNCC worker, travelled the United States to raise funds  for travel and expenses for the Mississippi Freedom Party and his friend and colleague, Fannie Lou Hamer to attend the 1964 Democratic National Convention.  With the help of Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Party leader Walter Mondale, Johnson engineered a "compromise" in which the national Democratic Party offered the MFDP two at-large seats, which allowed them to watch the floor proceedings but not take part. The MFDP refused this "compromise," which permitted the undemocratic, white-only, regulars to keep their seats and denied votes to the MFDP. While they were unsuccessful at being seated, their presence and Ms. Hamer’s testimony led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  
After leaving Mississippi, Frank Smith relocated in Washington, DC, where he continued his service to community.  Frank was elected to the D.C. Board of Education in 1979; and subsequently to Council of the District of Columbia in 1982 where he served for sixteen years.  His work focused on housing and economic development.   While on the Council, he served as chair of the Housing and Economic Development Committee, the Metropolitan Washington Area Transportation Authority and the Baseball Commission. As a councilmember he shared his  passion for gardening by introducing legislation to maintain the original victory gardens and allow DC residents to garden on vacant, District-owned properties.  He has been in the vanguard of urban housing activities, setting up the original Neimiah project in the District of Columbia; and introducing legislation for urban homesteading.  He also served as Chair of the DC Housing Authority.  After his stint with the Council, he focused on his passion – African American history—and found funding to build the African American Civil War Memorial, establish a nonprofit which supports the African American Civil War Museum.  
Smith is the Founding Executive Director and Board member of the African American Civil War Memorial Freedom Foundation and Museum.

The Aztec Motel was razed in early June 2011.

The Seventy-fourth Oregon Legislative Assembly was the Oregon Legislative Assembly (OLA)'s period from 2007 to 2008. (The Legislative Assembly is the legislative body of the U.S. state of Oregon, composed of the Oregon State Senate and the Oregon House of Representatives.) There was a regular session in 2007, and a shorter special session in 2008.
The 74th was the first Oregon legislature since 1989 in which both its houses were controlled by the Democratic Party of Oregon,Capitol Insider article, Oregon State Bar which won a one seat majority in the House in the 2006 elections. (Democrats had previously taken control of the Senate in 2004, and retained it in the 2006 elections.)[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] Democrats took credit for addressing a number of issues, and for adjourning a day before a self-imposed deadline (and before Independence Day, for the first time since 1995). Republican legislators, however, noted that there were no tax reforms to accompany the $15.1 billion (21%) increases in spending over the prior two-year budget. Democratic Governor Ted Kulongoski did not veto any bills during the session, and expressed general approval of the session.photo caption from The Oregonian, June 30, 2007 In August, after the session's conclusion, he did veto one bill which would have allocated $4.6 million in Portland General Electric ratepayers' fees to pay off a loan on behalf of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.
The Statesman Journal praised Kulongoski for being more engaged with the legislative process than he had been in the past. The paper also criticized the legislature for failing to take action on two critical issues, instead referring them to popular vote.

Ontario Options was a short-lived political party in Ontario, Canada.
The party was registered on June 10, 1994 by Don Scott, who was its only member at the time.  According to a summary article in the Montreal Gazette, Scott called for Canada to be divided into five separate countries: Ontario, Quebec, an Atlantic provinces federation to be called "Atlantis", a Prairie federation to be called "Alsatoba", and a union of British Columbia, Yukon and the Northwest Territories to be called "Columbia"."New one-man party wants a 5-way split", Montreal Gazette, 11 June 1994, A9.
Ontario Options does not appear to have fielded any candidates for federal office, although Scott ran under its banner in the 1995 provincial election.  As the party was not registered provincially, he appeared on the ballot as an independent.Valerie Lawton, "Fringe parties fight for attention in campaign", Kingston Whig-Standard, 12 May 1995, 13.  He received 506 votes (1.67%), finishing fourth against Liberal candidate Rick Bartolucci in Sudbury.  It is not clear if the party ran any other candidates.
Scott, a former New Democrat, later affiliated with the Canadian Action Party at the federal level.Chris Polehoykie, "Federal election races beginning to take shape", Sudbury Star, 26 October 2000, A3.

Timothy Murphy (born 1951, Hibbing, Minnesota) is an American poet, farmer, and businessman. He has published two collections of poetry that have been widely reviewed. His work has been compared to that of Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson and Richard Wilbur, and Wilbur himself has described Murphy as "a mature and greatly accomplished poet." [tpl]cite web |title=Timothy Murphy, Very Far North  |url=http://www.waywiser-press.com/murphy.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070220044115/http://www.waywiser-press.com/murphy.html |archivedate=2007-02-20[/tpl] (collected reviews)[tpl]cite journal|last=Cambridge |first=Gerry |title=Rich Gleanings: The Deed of Gift, by Timothy Murphy |journal=The Dark Horse |date=Autumn 1999 |pages=68–71 |url=http://www.star.ac.uk/darkhorse/archive/CambridgeonMurphy.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060930052209/http://www.star.ac.uk/darkhorse/archive/CambridgeonMurphy.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-30[/tpl] Writing of Murphy's second collection, Very Far North, critic Stephen Burt notes, "When Murphy sounds bad, he sounds obviously bad, like bad late Frost—but his good poems are poems Frost, or Jonson, might have admired." [tpl]cite journal |last=Burt |first=Stephen |date=April–May 2003 |title=New Poets on the Block |journal=Boston Review |url=http://www.bostonreview.net/BR28.2/burt.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014214628/http://bostonreview.net/BR28.2/burt.html |archivedate=2007-10-14[/tpl]
Murphy studied at Yale University under Robert Penn Warren, graduating (B.A.) as Scholar of the House in Poetry in 1972. However, Warren advised Murphy against an academic career, urging him instead to return to the "rich soil" of his rural roots.[tpl]cite journal|last=Murphy |first=Timothy |title=Reminiscences of Robert Penn Warren |journal=The Dark Horse |date=Spring 1998 |page=8 |url=http://www.thedarkhorsemagazine.com/Resources/MurphyOnPennWarren.pdf [/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Haven |first=Cynthia |date=November 2001 |title=Interview:Timothy Murphy |work=Cortland Review |url=http://www.cortlandreview.com/issue/18/murphy18.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061024155315/www.cortlandreview.com/issue/18/murphy18.html |archivedate=2006-10-24[/tpl]  Murphy returned to Minnesota, and subsequently became involved in several farming and manufacturing enterprises in North Dakota, experiences which are reflected in his later writing.
Murphy published his first collection of poetry, The Deed Of Gift, in 1998; the collection represents all of Murphy's work as a poet through about 1996. In a contemporary review of the volume, Gerry Cambridge summarized Murphy's accomplishment: "There are outstanding poems here, including ‘Harvest of Sorrows’, ‘Sunset at the Getty’, and ‘The Quarrel’, as well as a great number of very likeable, individual, and tautly-made pieces. It would be hard to confuse Murphy with any other contemporary poet. No one else writing poetry in English sounds quite like him."  As poet Dick Davis has noted, this distinctive style owes much to Murphy's use of traditional meter and rhyme, unusual among poets today: "His poems are wholly his own, and yet the voice in them lives in and through his mastery of traditional metre, which is so thorough as to seem indivisible from the poems’ sensibility and meaning."   This focus on rhyme and meter is exemplified in the following excerpt from "Harvest of Sorrows":

Murphy's second collection, Very Far North, was published in 2002. Murphy has also published Set the Ploughshare Deep: A Prairie Memoir (2000), and a translation of Beowulf (2004) with his partner Alan Sullivan.
The Lewis and Clark Foundation's Dakota Institute Press will be publishing a double volume of Murphy's poems, Mortal Stakes and Faint Thunder, in the spring of 2011.  In autumn they will publish Hunter's Log, a collection of Murphy's hunting poems illustrated by Eldridge Hardie.[tpl]cite journal |last=Pates|first=Mikkel |date=November 2010 |title=Former ND governor's memoirs |journal=Agweek |url=http://www.agweek.com/event/article/id/17457/group/Life/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101215191632/http://www.agweek.com/event/article/id/17457/group/Life/ |archivedate=2010-12-15[/tpl]

It is similar to games like Tapatan, Achi, Nine Holes, Shisima, and Tant Fant.  However, what makes this game unique is that pieces can jump over each other (without capture) which adds an extra dimension in the maneuverability of the pieces.

[[Back on Track (DeBarge album)]]
CATEGORIES: 1991 albums, DeBarge albums

Back on Track is the title of a gospel-oriented 1991 album by the family soul music group DeBarge, released on Truth Ministries. The "DeBarge" name is a bit misleading, as the album consisted of contributions from various members of the DeBarge family as opposed to being an official release by the "band" DeBarge.
Because of limited promotion from the little label and no other attention brought into the El-less lineup, the album fizzled.

[[The Unnamables]]

CATEGORIES: 1972 debut albums

The Unnamables is the only album by Univeria Zekt. It was released in 1972.
A Magma album in disguise, The Unnamables was designed to ease listeners into the musical world of Magma. Recorded by essentially the same line-up as on 1001° Centigrades (1972), the album basically repeats the stylistic development shown through Magma's first two albums, while abandoning the science fiction concept of the Kobaïan story.
Three tracks from Lasry and one from Cahen on the first half of the album approximate the accessibility of the better-known jazz-rock of the time. Vander's pieces on the second half of the album, however, begin to explore similar musical ground to that found on 1001° Centigrades. Two of Vander's pieces can also be found on the 1970 soundtrack to 24 Heures Seulement and are available on the Archiw I CD in the Studio Zünd 12 disc box collection. The Unnamables was originally released on Thélème, and reissued on Cryonic in 1986 and on Musea in 1993.

Şen was interviewed in April 2006 by a Turkish newspaper Vakit. Şen reported that female interrogators sexually abused him and desecrated the Koran, and that guards beat him with iron bars, and allowed him to be mauled by dogs, when he was in the Kandahar detention facility.  He reported that camp authorities would amputate wounded limbs rather than trying to provide less radical medical care.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] Şen reported being left for days in what he called "the insanity room", where captives were subjected to loud noise. Şen also claimed that most GIs in Guantanamo were Jewish, and wore skullcaps, and that a Rabbi was present during each interrogation. A Turkish columnist, Aslı Aydintaşbaş, criticized Şen for the "crude antisemitism" he showed in his interview. Şen and several other former captives are suing several current and former US officials for the inhumane and illegal conditions of their detention.[tpl]cite news |url=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/celikgogus-v.-rumsfeld|title=Celikgogus v.

Like Sen, the two other Turkish captives were repatriated prior to the institution of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals, in August 2004. The Algerian and Uzbek were among the 38 captives who were freed after their CSR Tribunals determined they never should have been classified as "enemy combatants". According to the DIA, İbrahim Şen was transferred to Turkey in November 2003. In January 2008, Şen was arrested in Van, Turkey, and charged as the leader of an active al-Qaida cell.

[[Piat Sauvage]]
CATEGORIES: Belgian painters, 1744 births, 1818 deaths, Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) alumni

Piat Joseph Sauvage was a Belgian painter. (Tournai 19 January 1744 - 11 June 1818)
Piat's father, Antoine, was a glass cutter. Piat worked in his father's factory until the age of 17, when he completed his technical schooling in drawing. He went on to improve his artistic education at the Antwerp Academy under the direction of Martin Joseph Geeraerts, an expert in grisaille and historic paintings..
He worked for a time in Brussels under the rule of the Habsburgs. He then joined the Saint Luc Academy in Paris, and in 1774 made nine paintings including the grisaille bas-relief La Mort de Germanicus (Germanicus death).
Sauvage was accepted into the Acadèmie royal de Paris after he produced a well-known painting of a round table with an embroidered cloth on which stand a statue of a child, a helmet, books, a violin, and other items. This canvas is at the Palace of Fontainebleau which also has other dessus-de-porte decorative works by this artist.
As his fame grew, he was chosen as the official painter of the Prince de Condé, and then by Louis XVI and the Royal Family. During this period, he painted Marie-Antoinette and produced paintings for the chapel of Saint-Cloud among other works.
His appointment as Royal artist did not keep him from joining the popular side of the French Revolution. His painting surprisingly did not slow down during this period of political upheaval.
From 1804 to 1807, he painted porcelain figurines for the famous Sèvres porcelain factory.
In 1808 he returned to Tournai to became the director of the Academy of Drawing. Until 1817, he succeeded in this role while famous artists such as Antoine Payen studied there. He also painted the Sept Sacrements, or Seven Sacraments, in the choir of the Tournai cathedral in order to replace the superb tapestries stolen by the Jacobins during the revolution.

The album was produced by former band member Jon English.
Four Moments features dramatic arrangements, seamlessly flowing with its impeccable musicianship displaying influences of European progressive rock bands Genesis, King Crimson, Focus and Yes. Millo, in a 2002 interview, reflected on the creation of the album:
[tpl]quote|"I began conceiving the various melodic phrases over a period of time and became excited by the idea of writing and ultimately performing an orchestral style piece. I knew I was on to something special and I wanted the world hear it. Sebastian Hardie was the perfect band for this ... At rehearsals we then took the ideas and began to assemble them, it wasn't long before we were ready to perform what was to become the 'Four Moments' album."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.progressor.net/interview/mario_millo.html |publisher=ProgressoR |title=Mario Millo interview |date=2002-05-21 |accessdate=2008-07-25 [/tpl]|Mario Millo|2002-05-21[/tpl]
According to Millo: "Glories Shall Be Released" was partly inspired by a boyhood friend's drug experiences - his distorted sense of reality and subsequent suicide, "Rosanna" was named for Millo's older sister who was an emotional support, and "Openings" evolved from the band's jamming.

[[Bonguk geom]]

CATEGORIES: Traditional Korean weapons, Korean_swords

Bonguk geom (Korean 본국검 "national sword", also  singeom  신검 "Silla sword") in  Joseon era Korean martial arts (17th to 18th centuries) referred to a sword and style of swordsmanship.
The term is introduced in the Muyesinbo of 1759 and the system is supposedly due to Crown Prince Sado. It contrasts with Jedok geom or "admiral sword", a system supposedly introduced by the Chinese admiral Li Rusong during the 16th-century Imjin War (the "national sword" system is conspicuously absent from the older Muyejebo manual of 1610).
The Muyesinbo stresses the antiquity of this "national" Korean system by including the narrative of a Silla "Flower Boy" called Hwangchang, who killed Baekje's king while performing a sword dance, geommu, at the court. 
The historical swords of the Silla period would have been double-edged swords comparable to those of   Eastern Han (see also Hwandudaedo). But the Bonguk geom as presented in the 18th century manual is ahistorically  based n a single-edged sword of the type common during that era.
In contemporary schools of Korean swordsmanship such as Haidong Gumdo, the term bonguk geom is used to emphasize their "national" Korean character, without necessarily bearing a direct relation to the 18th-century system.

[[John Buckler]]
CATEGORIES: 1770 births, 1851 deaths, British draughtsmen, British architects

John Buckler, Snr (30 November 1770 – 6 December 1851) was a British artist and occasional architect who is best remembered for his many drawings of churches and other historic buildings, recording much that has since been altered or destroyed.Colvin, 1997
Buckler was born in Calbourne, Isle of Wight. At the age of 15 he became clerk to the steward of Magdalen College, Oxford and began a lifelong involvement in the management of the college's London estates. After several years working on plans for new buildings, around 1801 he became bailiff and collector of rents for Magdalen College in Freeman's Court, London, and in Southwark, and held this post until his retirement in 1849. The work for the college allowed him ample free time, and he also practised as an architect until 1830, designing buildings such as Halkyn Castle, Flint (1822–27) for Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Earl Grosvenor (later created Marquess of Westminster) the tower of the church in Theale, Berkshire (1827–28).Tyack, 2004 Glastonbury Priory, also called Abbey House, Somerset (1829–30) for J.F. Reeves, and Poll Park, Denbighshire (c. 1828), for William Bagot, 2nd Baron Bagot, "an early essay in the half-timbered style", according to Howard Colvin, who suggested that Buckler had a hand in the Gothic remodelling of Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire, for Lord Bagot, 1822–23.
Buckler's interest in art developed over time, and his first published works were two aquatints of Magdalen College in 1797. He followed these in 1799 with an engraving of Lincoln Cathedral; the first in a series which included all the cathedrals in England by 1814, as well as many of the collegiate and parish churches. Shortly after 1800 he was commissioned by Richard Colt Hoare of Stourhead to produce ten volumes of drawings of churches and other historic buildings in Wiltshire, and Buckler's grandson described this commission as "deciding his brains for antiquarian pursuits". It was followed by similar commissions from other antiquarians, such as William Salt of Staffordshire,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.views.staffspasttrack.org.uk/about.asp |title=About the collection |accessdate=26 July 2008 |work= |publisher=Staffordshire Views Collection |date= [/tpl] and by the end of his life, by his own account, Buckler had produced around 13,000 drawings of buildings. Many of the buildings Buckler drew had not been previously recorded, and many have since been demolished or substantially altered, so his work is now a valuable source of information on British architectural history. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy every year from 1798 until 1849, and he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1810.The Annual Register, Or, A View of the History and Politics of the Year 1851 (1852), London:George Woodfall & Son, p.361.
John Buckler died in Newington, London, in 1851, two years after his retirement. Forty-two volumes of his sketchesMixed with those of his son, J.C. Buckler, whose "pencil drawings of ancient buildings are almost indistinguishable in technique from those of his father" (Colvin). are now held by the British Library;Add. Mss. 36356-97 other places  holding collections of his work include the Devizes Museum in Wiltshire, Taunton Museum, the William Salt Library in Stafford and the Bodleian Library in Oxford.
His eldest son, John Chessell Buckler (1793–1894), also an architect and artist, wrote several illustrated books on the history of British architecture, and his youngest son, George Buckler (1811–1886), practised as an architect as well.

It opened in 2001 along with two other 'flat' rides, Vortex and Zodiac. It is around [tpl]convert|115|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and is not released via a computer. The ride operator at the bottom has a button which he/she can press to make the car go at any time once the car has reached the top. Once released, the car is fired downwards by pneumatics rather than simply falling under gravity,
the ride reaches a speed of 46 mph at the base of the drop, giving the impression of weightlessness for riders. For the 2011 season on ride photos were added.
The ride was originally planned to be placed where Zodiac currently sits but was moved after Wicked Witches Haunt burned down hence the lost city theming seen on other rides such as Vortex & Zodiac. When Nemesis Inferno opened, the queue line was altered.

The Steam Boat Association of Great Britain (SBA) is a waterway society  It was formed in 1971 to promote steamboats and represent steamboat owners' interests, and it has around 1100 members, a third of whom live outside the UK. 
The Association holds rallies all over the UK and other events including national and regional meetings, technical seminars, displays at model engineering exhibitions, and engages with a range of related engineering topics  It also publishes technical manuals.
The SBA recognises that steam boating is a fairly niche activity demanding a measure of engineering skills in those who build and maintain boats. Close attention is paid to safety issues  and particularly the integrity of boilers and steam fittings.  The trading arm of the SBA is the Steamboat Association Services  Ltd (SBAS) which provides boiler testing services for members alongside seminars and other information services for those wishing to build their own boats.
It is estimated that of the 400 or so small steam launches (most of which are between 5–10 metres in length) around 90 or so will be steam in any given summer season in the UK and the SBA's quarterly journal, 'The Funnel' is an 80pp colour production designed to bring together and inform steam boaters around the world.

Jkr. Alexander Frederik de Savornin Lohman (Groningen, May 29, 1837 – The Hague, June 11, 1924) was a Dutch politician and leader of the Christian Historical Union during the first quarter of the 20th century.
He was a member of the lower Dutch nobility and held the title of jonkheer. He was born into a family of Walloon Reformed extraction. During his studies he became a supporter of the anti-revolutionary cause of Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer and he was elected to the Dutch House of Representatives for the Anti Revolutionary Party (ARP) in 1879. He remained a member of parliament until 1921. Throughout his career he would serve as member of the House of Representatives, member of the Senate and, for a short while, minister. He was noted for his vehement attacks against his opponents, but was generally considered to be receptive of the arguments of his peers.
De Savornin Lohman got involved in politics whilst serving as a judge at the court of 's-Hertogenbosch. There he became party to a conflict over Christian schools. He soon met Abraham Kuyper, another anti-revolutionary politician who would dominate Dutch politics in the years to come. When Kuyper was suffering from burnout in 1876 and 1877 de Savornin Lohman replaced him as chief editor of the Standaard, the anti-revolutionary newspaper. De Savornin Lohman went on, at times reluctantly, to become Kuyper's most important collaborator in his many projects (the School Struggle, the foundation of the Anti Revolutionary Party in 1879, the Doleantie in 1886 and the creation of the Free University of Amsterdam in 1879).
De Savornin Lohman's entry in politics coincided with the introduction of party discipline into Dutch politics. As an aristocrat de Savornin Lohman was torn between the opinion of his fellow aristocrats, who considered politics to be a personal thing, and the opinion of his leader and friend Kuyper, who found party discipline and the democratic process of the utmost importance. Further conflict ensued when de Savornin Lohman became Minister of the Interior, replacing Æneas Mackay, who in turn replaced Keuchenius as Minister of Colonial Affairs. The Dutch parliament had refused supply to Keuchenius's budget and Mackay wanted to save the government. Kuyper wanted to have a general election and sought the fall of the government. De Savornin Lohman and most of the Anti Revolutionary Party supported the government. Two factions in the ARP now emerged, one led by Kuyper the other by De Savornin Lohman. When the liberal minister Tak van Poortvliet presented a proposal to introduce universal suffrage in 1893, this proved to be an especially divisive issue. The aristocrat De Savornin Lohman was against extension, while Kuyper saw an electoral advantage for the ARP. Universal suffrage would give the bote to orthodox Protestant farmers and small entrepreneurs (collectively referred to in Dutch political science as kleine luyden), who had hitherto been ineligible because of the minimum taxes requirement. When Kuyper managed to persuade ARP members to support his position, De Savornin Lohman's faction, the Free Anti Revolutionaries (VAR), became directly opposed to Kuyper's Anti Revolutionaries. The conflict led to a split in the ARP with De Savornin Lohman and his largely aristocratic colleagues forming the smaller splinter group. In 1908, after a series of mergers with like-minded political groups, De Savornin Lohman and his VAR  founded the Christian Historical Union (CHU).
Religiously, De Savornin Lohman, who was Reformed, was personally involved in the schism called the Doleantie, which was led by Kuyper. The schism was a reaction against the progressive practices of the Dutch Reformed Church and De Savornin Lohman went on to become a member of the newly founded Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. While Kuyper favoured cooperation with Roman Catholics in parliament, de Savornin Lohman and his fellow Anti Revolutionaries were sceptical towards Roman Catholicism.
Professionally, De Savornin Lohman was employed by the Free University of Amsterdam to teach law and a Reformed outlook on science. In 1895 the conflict with Kuyper forced him to resign his post. It was twenty years before the two gentlemen were on speaking terms again.
In 1902 he acted as one of five arbitrators at The Hague in the Pious Fund of the Californias dispute between the United States and Mexico, the first dispute between states arbitrated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.  He also sat on the panel for the Sarvarkar Case in 1911.
Alexander de Savornin Lohman died in The Hague aged 87. He was an important adviser to Queen Wilhelmina.

[[Doleantie]]
CATEGORIES: Christianity in the Netherlands, Dutch Reformed Church

The Doleantie (from Latin dolere, 'to feel sorrow') was the name of a prominent schism in the Dutch Reformed Church (Nederlands Hervormde Kerk) which took place in 1886 and was led by the renowned minister Abraham Kuyper. The Doleantie was not the first schism in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1834 another schism, the Secession of 1834 (Afscheiding van 1834), had led to the formation of the Christian Reformed Church in the Netherlands (Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk in Nederland). 
In 1885 the first moves towards schism were made when Kuyper and his supporters issued a formal complaint about the perceived excessive liberal and progressive practices in the Dutch Reformed Church. Their complaint never won broad support within the Dutch Reformed Church and in the winter of 1885-1886 the call for schism grew stronger amongst a large number of conservative congregations in the Dutch Reformed Church. Most of these congregations were located in what is today the Dutch Bible Belt and especially in the Veluwe area.
The first congregation to secede was Kootwijk, which appointed a minister trained at the Free University of Amsterdam without waiting for permission of the classis of the Dutch Reformed Church on February 7, 1886. The following day the congregation in Voorthuizen followed suit.
The seceded congregations united in the Low German Reformed Church (Dolerende) (Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (Dolerende)). Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk had been the official name of the Dutch Reformed Church until 1816 and with this name the seceded churches wanted to show that they thought of themselves as the legitimate continuation of this church, which was highly prominent in the Dutch Republic. The suffix (Dolerende), meaning 'those who feel sorrow', was added to show their disapproval with the Dutch Reformed Church. 
Later in 1886 Kuyper and his supporters occupied the New Church in Amsterdam, the seat of the governing body of the Reformed Church, to force a settlement in the conflict over church property that had followed the Doleantie. In July 1886 the dolerenden had to accept a verdict against them.
In 1892 the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerken (Dolerende) merged with the Christian Reformed Church in the Netherlands to form the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands.

Elinor Mavor (born c. 1936) was the editor of Amazing Stories and Fantastic from early 1979 until late 1982.  She had done illustrations and production work for several magazines, working for Arthur Bernhard.  She had also been an editor at Bill of Fare, a restaurant trade magazine.  When Ted White resigned from Bernhard's UPD in November 1978, Mavor became the editor of both Bernhard's science fiction magazines.  She had read a good deal of science fiction but knew nothing about the world of science fiction magazines.Ashley, Gateways, pp. 348–355.
For the first few issues Mavor used the pseudonym of "Omar Gohagen", as she was unsure whether a woman editor could be accepted by the readership.  Her tenure saw the magazines improve in the quality of the graphics, but she was unable to make the magazines successful.  In 1980, Fantastic was merged with Amazing; and in May 1982, TSR, Inc. acquired Amazing from Bernhard, who was retiring.  By this time the circulation had dropped to only about 11,000.  George H. Scithers took over as editor for TSR.

[[Israeli outpost]]

CATEGORIES: Arab–Israeli conflict, History of Israel, Israeli settlements, Israeli–Palestinian conflict

The term Israeli outpost ([tpl]lang-he|מאחז[/tpl], Ma'ahaz lit. "a handhold") usually refers to an unauthorized or illegal Israeli settlement within the West Bank, constructed without the required authorization from the Israeli government in contravention of Israeli statutes regulating planning and construction. In Israeli law, outposts are distinguished from settlements authorized by the Israeli government. This distinction between illegal outposts and "legal" settlements is not endorsed by international law, which considers both a violation of the norms, governing belligerent occupations, applicable to the West Bank.[tpl]cite book| author=Asʻad Ġānim| title=Palestinian Politics After Arafat: A Failed National Movement| publisher=Indiana University Press| year= 2010| page= 32|quote= all forms of settlement in the occupied territories are considered prohibited under international law, Israel considers only settlement 'outposts' illegal.[/tpl]
Outposts appeared after the 1993 Oslo I Accord, when the Israeli government made commitments to freeze the building of new settlements.[tpl]cite book| author=Eyal Benvenisti| title=The International Law of Occupation| publisher=Oxford University Press| year= 2012 | page=236| quote= outposts were settlements that sprouted without formal authorization by the military administration due to commitments given by the Israeli government during the Oslo process not to built new settlements.[/tpl] Although outposts were not officially supported by the government, Israeli public authorities and other government bodies played a major role in establishing and developing them, according to the 2005 Sasson Report, commissioned by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 
Outposts differ from neighborhoods in that they are built at a substantial distance from authorized settlements, while neighborhoods are attached to an existing settlement.
In July 2002, the Israeli government acknowledged that 69 outposts had been established since 1996.[tpl]cite web| author=Geoffrey Aronson | publisher=Foundation for Middle East Peace | title=New "Outposts" Lead Settlement Expansion.

In 2012, ten unauthorized outposts were retroactively legalised by the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, according to the Israeli NGO Peace Now, by redesignating them as a neighbourhood of nearby settlements.  
Outposts often are provided with security by the Israel Defense Forces.[tpl]cite web| author=Gili Cohen| url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-troops-provide-security-for-all-west-bank-outposts-regardless-of-legal-status.premium-1.513112 | title=IDF troops provide security for all West Bank outposts - regardless of legal status| work= Haaretz |date= 3 April 2013| accessdate= 16 April 2013[/tpl] The term "outpost" may also refer to a military outpost.

[[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Super heavyweight]]

CATEGORIES: Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics

The super heavyweight class in the boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics competition is the heaviest class.  Super heavyweights were limited to those boxers weighing over 91 kilograms (200.6 pounds).
Like all Olympic boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with one minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches by the end of the bout. 
16 boxers qualified for this category after the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships and 9 Continental Qualification Tournaments.

EA-3167 is a potent and long lasting anticholinergic deliriant drug, related to the chemical warfare agent 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). It was developed under contract to Edgewood Arsenal during the 1960s as part of the US military chemical weapons program, in an attempt to develop non-lethal incapacitating agents. EA-3167 has identical effects to QNB, but is even more potent and longer lasting, with an effective dose when administered by injection of as little as 2.5μg/kg (i.e. 0.2 milligrams for an 80kg person), and a duration of 120-240 hours (5-10 days).[tpl] cite book | url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=740&page=195 | author = Wills H | chapter = Appendix I: Digest Report -- Anticholinergic Chemicals | title = Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Chemical Agents | volume = 1 | year = 1982 | editor = National Research Council (U.S.).

The Turkish Armed Forces in Northern Cyprus officially the Cyprus Turkish Peace Force (Turkish: Kıbrıs Türk Barış Kuvvetleri or KTBK) is the Turkish military garrison on Cyprus. In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Cyprus following a Greek Cypriot coup (organized and supported by the Greek government, which was still in the hands of a military junta) which wanted to enforce union with Greece, occupying the northern third of the island. The invasion force, which consisted of about 40,000 soldiers and 200 tanks, subsequently was reduced to a garrison of 17,000 troops. It outnumbers the Greek military contingent on the island, which is supplemented by the Greek Cypriot National Guard of 12,000 active and 75,000 reserves. Air reinforcement of the Turkish troops can be effected, if necessary, within hours.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+tr0103%29 Nevertheless, the unresolved dispute over Cyprus complicates Turkish participation in NATO and remains an obstacle to NATO's effectiveness in the region.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+tr0103%29

Faced with a possible prison sentence if charged and convicted, police attempted to get her to identify other marijuana dealers to avoid the charges.  She refused.  The police then pressured her to act as a confidential informant in a drug sting operation instead, in exchange for not being charged with additional drug charges. The intended goal of the operation was to buy 1,500 ecstasy pills, 2 ounces of cocaine, and a handgun (which was contrary to department policy as it opened the opportunity for the suspected criminals to explain the presence of the gun[tpl]huh|date=March 2014[/tpl]), using $13,000 cash in a buy–bust operation and all three buys were very out of character for Rachel, her family stated.

According to police documents, a witness described seeing the BMW stuck in a ditch, with a 2005 Volvo belonging to Hoffman idling nearby, between 7 pm and 7:30 pm, about 30 minutes after the police lost track of Hoffman.  The witness claimed that the Volvo drove off when he stopped to help the BMW driver try to get the car out of the ditch, but the Volvo later returned as the witness was leaving.  The witness claimed he became suspicious and decided to leave when the driver of the BMW opened the trunk and revealed a camouflage blanket and neat stacks of female clothing.  
Deneilo R. Bradshaw, 23, and Andrea Jabbar Green, 25, who were fired from their jobs at a window tint and car detailing shop just days before the incident, were charged with armed robbery in connection with the events leading up to Hoffman's death.[tpl]cite news |first=Nic |last=Corbett |title=Hoffman's parents want clarity on judge's order |url=http://www.tallahassee.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080726/NEWS01/807260331/1010 |work=tallahassee.com |publisher=Tallahassee Democrat |date=2008-07-26 |accessdate=2008-07-26 [/tpl]  
The Tallahassee Police Department admitted that Hoffman had no training to work undercover, she did not know the two men targeted in the sting, and she had no experience with cocaine or firearms and very little with MDMA.

[[Moresque]]
CATEGORIES: Visual motifs, Mannerism, Decorative arts

Moresque is an obsolete alternative term to "Moorish" in English, and in the arts has some specific meanings.  By itself the word is used of forms found in ornament and decoration in the applied arts in Europe.  Often it is a synonym for arabesque or interlace patterns in the Mannerist and Northern Mannerist styles of the 16th century, derived from Islamic ornament.  It was defined in 1611 by Randle Cotgrave's A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues as: "a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &c." OED, "Moresque"  The word is also used for such a figure, starting off as a human or animal, but terminating as part of a decorative scheme of foliage or geometric strapwork.
In fact the origin of figures like those described by Cotgrave comes not from the Islamic world, but from the Renaissance version, influenced by the Ancient Roman grotesque decorative style, of medieval ornament, especially that found in illuminated manuscripts. Here men and beasts whose forms disappear into geometric or foliage decoration go back almost a thousand years to the interlace of Insular art seen in the Book of Kells and other manuscripts.  These themselves derive from the Animal style of barbarian Europe.  However the term "moresque" is not used of these medieval versions.

The Mr. Hong Kong Contest ([tpl]zh|t=香港先生選舉[/tpl]), or Mr.HK (港男) for short, is a beauty contest for young men, organized by leading Hong Kong television station TVB. The contest has been an annual event since 2005, and winners will have the opportunity to represent Hong Kong for the Mister World contest.
Like the Miss Hong Kong Pageant, top Mr. Hong Kong contestants are awarded to a contract with TVB, and many of them become promoted television actors. A contestant and runner-up in 2005, Byron Pang, even went on to become a film star (in the 2009 Hong Kong movie Amphetamine).
The contest also has other consolation prizes that vary slightly from year to year. Unlike their female counterpart, Mr. Hong Kong does not have specific first and second runner-up positions. Contestants are divided into two groups, the Stylish Youth Division (瀟灑少年) and the Maturity Division (健力盛年), and a winner is chosen from both groups. The final winner (the Mr. Hong Kong) will then be determined by the top contestants of both groups.
Judges for the contest are all women, and winners of the contest are also determined by a public vote of 600 to 800 female viewers. The first ever winner of the contest was Matthew Ko.
The modern Mr. Hong Kong Contest is completely unrelated to the original Mr. Hong Kong bodybuilding contest from the 1970s.

[[At Her Majesty's pleasure]]
CATEGORIES: Monarchy in Canada, Canadian law, English legal terms, Law in the United Kingdom

At Her Majesty's pleasure (sometimes abbreviated to Queen's pleasure or, when appropriate, at His Majesty's pleasure or King's pleasure) is a legal term of art referring to the indeterminate length of service of certain appointed officials or the indeterminate sentences of some prisoners. It is based on the concept that all legitimate authority for government comes from the Crown. Originating in the United Kingdom, it is now used throughout the Commonwealth realms. In realms where the monarch is represented by a Governor-General, the phrase may be modified to be at the Governor's pleasure, since the governor-general, governor, or lieutenant governor is the Queen's personal representative in the country, state or province.

The grounds outside the science building and the library courtyard feature artworks created by the school's students, and from end 2010 to the start of 2011 school year the school was upgrading both Science and Year 8 Blocks, however due to many faults in the science block and having to close down again after it opened, it was not officially open until last term of 2011.

[[Crowds and Power]]
CATEGORIES: 1960 books, Books about crowd psychology, German non-fiction books, Victor Gollancz Ltd books

Crowds and Power (original German title Masse und Macht) is a 1960 book by Elias Canetti, dealing with the dynamics of crowds and "packs" and the question of how and why crowds obey rulers. Canetti draws a parallel between ruling and paranoia. Also, the memoirs of Daniel Paul Schreber are analyzed with an implicit critique of Sigmund Freud.
The book was translated from German into English by Carol Stewart in 1962 and published by Gollancz.
It is notable for its unusual tone; although wide ranging in its erudition, it is not scholarly or academic in a conventional way. Rather, it reads like a manual written by someone outside the human race explaining to another outsider in concise and highly metaphoric language how people form mobs and manipulate power. Unlike most non-fiction writing, it is highly poetic and seething with anger.
On asking questions:
"On the questioner the effect is a feeling of enhanced power. He enjoys this and consequentially asks more and more questions; every answer he receives is an act of submission. Personal freedom consists largely in having a defense against questions. The most blatant tyranny is the one which asks the most blatant questions."  Crowds and Power, p. 285 
This work remains important for the insights it provided into the Eastern European upheaval which can be understood within the framework Canetti puts forth.Kiss (2004), p.730  Showing the growth of crowds and their power against even the power of the state.
Canetti’s Crowds and Power remains an important work of our century, the insights
of which in recent years have once again been corroborated in a particularly spectacular
fashion. The Eastern European political and economic transition, which has proved to
be especially fruitful from a theoretical point of view, can be meaningfully interpreted
and hermeneutically “read” within the framework of Canetti’s mass psychology.

John Robertson Reid (1851–1926) was a Scottish painter who spent his early working life in Surrey, and then from the early 1880s in Cornwall in the wild south-west of England. He became the president of the Society of British Artists in 1886 and the Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in 1898. These posts gave him an entree into London society, and from the early 1900s he made his home in London.  In Reid's later years, the young Sir Winston Churchill used to paint outdoors in the company of Reid.
He trained under George Chalmers and William MacTaggart.  His mature style was influenced by the move in painting toward rural Naturalism (Sir George Clausen) and the French Realists (Jules Bastien-Lepage) and also owes a little to Impressionism.  He first found success with natural outdoor scenes of the Surrey countryside, and was notable at the time for painting his scenes entirely on location, with the use of hired local people posing in the scene. He also painted notable rural cricket match scenes, one of which now contain details of interest to cricketing historians.  This is A Country Cricket Match, painted in the grounds at the rear of The Well House, West Sussex.
His sisters, Lizzie Reid and Flora MacDonald Reid (1879-c.1929), were also exhibiting artists.  Reid was the great-uncle of Sir Norman Reid, Director of the Tate Gallery.

Bái Tử Long National Park ([tpl]lang-vi|Vườn quốc gia Bái Tử Long[/tpl]) is a protected area zone in northeastern Vietnam. It was established in 2001, succeeding from the former Ba Mun National Conservation Zone. It is one of seven Vietnamese amphibian national parks which has both terrestrial zone and aquatic zone.
It is located within Bái Tử Long Bay,  which with Hạ Long Bay forms an impressive scenery of sea and islands. Including thousands of islands and rocks, they create one of the most beautiful bays in the world.
According to legend, an immense dragon descended to Hạ Long Bay (meaning ‘’Descending Dragon’’) millions years ago, dropping numerous eggs. These eggs hatched forming thousands of  rocks and islands. The tail of the dragon extended far to the sea, forming Bạch Long Vĩ island (meaning "The Tail of the White Dragon"). As she returned to heaven, she said good bye to her offspring at the Bái Tử Long Bay (means "The dragon parts the offspring").
Now the Park is part of Vân Đồn District, 20 km distant from Cái Rồng town.

Three numbered highway systems are present in the U.S. state of Utah: the Interstate Highway System, the United States Numbered Highways system (more commonly known as "U.S. Routes") and the state route system. Both the Interstate and U.S. Highway system are nationwide systems with only a small portion of these routes entering Utah. The Utah Department of Transportation is responsible for maintaining all of the Interstate, U.S. Routes and state highways in the state. Originally, the State Road Commission of Utah, created on March 23, 1909 was responsible for maintenance, but these duties were rolled into the new Department of Transportation in 1975.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.state.ut.us/cgi-bin//cathtmljava2.cgi?RUN-WHAT=CATHTML&TEMPLATE=AGENCY&AGENCY=831|title=Utah State Archives Catalog|accessdate=2008-07-29[/tpl]

[[Bitto Albertini]]
CATEGORIES: Italian film directors, 1924 births, 1999 deaths, People from Turin

Adalberto "Bitto" Albertini (1924–1999) was an Italian film director. He began his film career as a cameraman, and in 1969 he directed War Devils. In 1974 Albertini directed Black Emanuelle starring the then unknown Laura Gemser. Her subsequent successful career meant that she was absent from Black Emanuelle No 2, and Albertini instead had to cast actress Sharon Leslie in the title role. The film without Gemser was unsuccessful, and Albertini was ruined.
In 1977 he released Yellow Emanuelle as a come back. The film, starring Chai Lee, was very successful. However the film never reached the popularity of Joe D'Amato's series. Albertini was by then an almost forgotten director, his last two films were "Mondo's" set in Asia, depicting socking rituals and savage violence. Bitto is perhaps best remembered for giving the world Laura Gemser.
He died in Rome in 1999 at age 74.

The etymology of Agariyashiki is considered to be the historical fact that its southern area, today officially known as Mejiro, Toshima and Shimo-Ochiai, Shinjuku, was a hunting zone owned by Tokugawa clan and its shoguns came to the present-day Agariyashiki area as a resting place.
Today, the term Agariyashiki is recognized by Toshima Ward Agariyashiki Park and the Agariyashiki town council. There used to be Agariyashiki Station, owned by Seibu Ikebukuro Line, but the station became defunct in 1953.

The Battle of the Spoiling Dyke (also known as the Battle of the Spoiled Dyke, Blar Milleadh a’ Ghàraidh, Millegearaidh) was a Scottish clan battle that took place in 1578, fought in the Scottish Highlands, between the MacDonalds of Uist and the Clan MacLeod.Clan MacLeod@Electric Scotland.com"The Massacre at Trumpan Church and the subsequent Battle of the Spoiled Dyke". The Hendry Family. Retrieved 25 May 2008.
The MacDonalds of Uist barred the doors of Trumpan Church, or Kilconan Church as it was once known, east of the shores of Ardmore Bay. They then set fire to the church full of worshipers. No one escaped alive except one girl who, although mortally wounded, managed to give the alarm. On hearing the news, the chief of Clan MacLeod and his men set off for Ardmore bay where a battle ensued. The MacDonalds were killed almost to a man. The corpses of the MacDonalds were dragged and then buried in a turf dyke, and the incident remembered as the "Battle of the Spoiling Dyke". The atrocity by the MacDonalds was to exact vengeance on the MacLeods for their atrocity of the massacre of MacDonalds in the Cave of Frances on the Isle of Eigg a couple of years earlier.Kieran, Ben.

According to the unofficial Chessmetrics ratings, the tournament was (as of March 2005) the strongest tournament in history, on the basis that nine of the ten top players in the world participated, including all of the top eight."Formulas", Chessmetrics website
The Vienna Chess Society was formed in October 1857, and this tournament played from 10 May to 24 June 1882 was held on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. The main sponsors were Ignác Kolisch and the club's president Albert Salomon von Rothschild, who together donated 7500 francs to be split over the top six. Franz Joseph I of Austria was the patron of the event, who also donated a special prize of 2000 Austrian Gulden (Kaiserpreis).

Lady Arundel's Manchet is a traditional version of a manchet, a traditional English yeast bread from Sussex.
The recipe for Lady Arundel's Manchet was first published in 1653 according to Elizabeth David.English Bread and Yeast Cookery Paperback: 624 pages Publisher: Penguin Books Ltd; Language English ISBN 0-14-046791-2 ISBN 978-0140467918 It was a luxurious bread eaten by the medieval aristocracy and remained popular into the Restoration period. A recipe appears in A True Gentlewoman's Delight (1653) printed for the Countess of Kent.Sca Cooking
Lady Arundel's Manchets crossed the Atlantic to Virginia with the early colonists according to Katherine E Harbury.Katherine E Harbury: Colonial Virginia's Cooking Dynasty (2004) Univ of South Carolina Press p. 98 ISBN 1-57003-513-X
Florence White also references Lady Arundel's Manchet's in her 1932 English Cookery book Good Things in England,Florence White: Good Things in England published by English Folk Cookery Association 1932 Jonathan Cape 1968 publishing a description of a 1676 recipe and updating it for a contemporary readership.
Manchets were often used as part of other dishes. For example, a recipe for a baked pudding that incorporates manchet is included in "Things Not Generally Known, Familiarly Explained," citing The Queene's Royal Cookbook of 1713. This is a rich pudding that includes double cream, the addition of beef suet and added aromatics such as nutmeg, cinnamon and rose water.John Timbs, W. Kent and Co, Robson: Things Not Generally Known, Familiarly Explained (1859) Publishers Kent & Co page 42
Lady Arundel's Manchets are rarely made today. Manchets generally ceased to appear in English cookery books after 1800. The closest similar yeast bread is probably a Bath bun or a Sally Lunn bun.

The Battle of Traigh Ghruinneart or in Scottish Gaelic Blàr Tràigh Ghruineart or sometimes called the Battle of Gruinart Strand was a Scottish clan battle fought on 5 August 1598, on the Isle of Islay, in the Scottish Highlands. It was fought between the Clan Donald and Clan Maclean.[tpl]cite book |author=Reverend Angus Macdonald and Reverend Archibald Macdonald |coauthors= |title=The Clan Donald, Volume 2 |year=1900 |publisher= |page= |quote=A fierce battle was fought at a place called Traigh Ghruinneart, at the head of Loch Gruinneart. The Macdonald leader is said to have displayed some strategy at the beginning of the day. By making a semi-retrograde movement, he secured the advantage of getting his men posted on a hill, and at the same time avoided the discomfort which his adversaries experienced of having the glare of the summer sun in his eyes. In the end, the Clan Donald, having repulsed the Maclean vanguard, and thrown them back upon the main body, threw the whole force into confusion, with the result that they were totally routed, and the brave Sir Lauchlan, with 80 of his kinsmen and 200 of his common soldiers, were left dead upon Traigh Ghruinneart. Lauchlan Barrach Maclean, who was severely wounded, escaped with the survivors to the galleys. Nor did the Clan Donald get off scatheless. About 30 of them were slain and 60 wounded, while Sir James, who was dangerously wounded by an arrow through the body, was during most of the following night left for dead among the slain.  | url=http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA573&lpg=PA573&dq=Traigh+Ghruinneart&sig=xjlLvoj98OmJaej28TUC-KpVCSk&ei=TVQVUN6ILoeJ6AHYtYHAAg&id=vBIXAAAAYAAJ&ots=-ycRDor-H7&output=text |isbn= [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=Conflicts of the Clans: The Death of Sir Lauchlan Maclean in 1598 |year=1764 |publisher=Foulis Press |page= |quote=Sir Lauchlan Maclean's ambition, together with his desire of revenge, thrust him on to claim the inheritance of the whole Isle of Islay, being always the possession and ancient inheritance of the Clan Donald, all which Maclean thought easily now to compass, Sir James Macdonald (the just inheritor thereof) being young, and his father, Angus Macdonald, aged. ...| url=http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/conflict/Lauchlan_MacLean_Death.html |isbn= [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=Murder Under Trust by Nicholas Maclean-Bristol |year=1999 |publisher=Tuckwell Press |page= |quote= | url= |isbn= [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=John Patterson MacLean |coauthors= |title=A History of the Clan MacLean from Its First Settlement at Duard Castle, in the Isle of Mull, to the Present Period: Including a Genealogical Account of Some of the Principal Families Together with Their Heraldry, Legends, Superstitions, etc. |year=1889 |publisher=R.

He fought A. J. "Bazooka" Banal of the Philippines for the WBA interim Super Flyweight Title on July 26, 2008 which he came out the victor. Though trailing in points, Concepcion sent Banal to the canvass in the 10th round. Due to exhaustion, his opponent refuse to rise back and continue. 
On his first defense of the crown, Concepcion took on former world title holder Jorge Arce on September 15 that same year. After a vicious exchange of punches, he conceded the match and the title at the end of the 9th round. 
He faced Nonito Donaire on August 15, 2009 in the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada to regain the same title he lost which has become vacant. On the weigh-in, however, Concepcion was more than 4 pounds overweight and could not go lower on time. Thus the title became only available for Donaire who successfully made the weight limit.[ref]

[[Politics and Vision]]
CATEGORIES: 1960 books, 2004 books

Politics and Vision: Continuity and Innovation in Western Political Thought is a work of political theory by Princeton Emeritus Professor Sheldon S. Wolin.   Part One, consisting of ten chapters and first published in 1960, distinguishes political philosophy from philosophy in general and traces political philosophy from its Platonic origins to modern day.  Part Two, consisting of seven chapters and published (along with Part One) in a 2004 expanded edition, traces the development of political thought from Marx, Nietzsche, and others up to the late 20th century.  Wolin left Part One unaltered in the expanded edition, confining the expressions of his changes in thought about political theory to those sections of Part Two that overlap with Part One.  
One sign of the significance of the work is the large number of graduate students and professors who for three decades used it as a primary source of guidance in the field of political theory.[tpl]cite book |author=Aryeh Botwinick and William E. Connolly |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Democracy and Vision: Sheldon Wolin and the Vicissitudes of the Political |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |pages=6–9, passim |quote= | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1DoZyQLlHv4C&pg=PA6 |isbn=978-0-691-07466-5 [/tpl]
In revising the work, Wolin cites three major changes in political theory and politics between 1960 and 2004: (1) the aftermath of Fascism's fall in Europe and Communism's fall generally, with an intervening constant "semi-mobilization" by liberal democracies, (2) an increase in the rights of citizens against the tendencies of regimentation by the state (e.g. anti-discrimination laws), and (3) an increase in the ability of nations to "control, punish, survey, direct, and influence citizens."  Wolin states that the first change necessitated the latter two changes, leading to an "inverted totalitarianism" where increased rights exist alongside a less participatory citizenry under more pervasive governmental control.Sheldon S. Wolin, Politics and Vision: Continuity and Innovation in Western Political Thought, xvi, (2004)
Wolin states that an inquiry is a process, a tool to find truths.  Philosophy is distinguished from other forms of inquiry in that "philosophy claims to deal with truths publicly arrived at and publicly demonstrable."Wolin, 2004, p. 4.  Contrasted with this are revealed truths dealing with sacred rites, religion, and private findings of conscience or feelings.  Political philosophy hews close to this characteristic of philosophy as a whole, with the public ("demos") at times in history demanding that laws be publicly demonstrated and accessible, even if their origin was supposedly revealed truth.  For Wolin, it is the nature of politics that common concerns are brought before the political process, because the political is best equipped both to confront those concerns and to do so in a public, demonstrable, and thus philosophical manner.
The discernment of what within philosophy exactly is political and what is not is confused by two factors: (1) the line can be blurred due to the interaction of political factors with other influences and (2) the language used to describe political ideas is often used in other contexts, and vocabulary from other areas is often applied to the political.

Aimed at aircraft owners and pilots, there is a strong focus on safety which is reflected by the training-dedicated articles, anecdotal accounts of in-flight emergencies and accident reports. The magazine is generally composed of news, columns, featured articles, market-place listings, fly-in or airshow reports and sometimes a supplement featuring a popular aerodrome in South Africa.
FlightCom is also a South African magazine released in association with SA Flyer. FlightCom has been used as a vehicle to cover all aspects of the Aviation Industry in Africa and the Middle East. Consequently, it has a much broader scope and is very often focused on larger aircraft and airline operations. As part of SA Flyer, FlightCom now offers a quality magazine to cover the aviation events occurring in Africa and the Middle East.

CATEGORIES: Foreign Ministers of the Republic of China, Presidents of the United Nations Security Council, Permanent Representatives of the Republic of China to the United Nations, People from Huanggang, Republic of China politicians from Hubei, 1889 births, 1952 deaths

Quo Tai-chi (Chinese: 郭泰祺, Wade–Giles: Kuo T'ai-ch'i) was a Chinese career diplomat during Republican Era of China and active member of the Kuomintang from the early years of the Republic of China until shortly after the fall of mainland China to the Communist Party of China.
Quo was born in Hupei (Hubei) province in 1888 and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1911, Phi Beta Kappa.
He was one of the technical delegates of China to the Paris Peace Conference, 1918–1919. At a time when the victors of the Great War were negotiating the spoils of war and punishment of the conquered, Quo controversially stated it would be better for the Germans to retain their concessions in Shantung (Shandong) than to allow the aggressive, militarist Japanese to take possession of them. The Chinese delegation's wishes were largely ignored by the European powers, and Quo's words proved prophetic as over the next three decades, Japan's appetite for conquest proved genocidal.
Quo published a book in English, entitled China's Fight for Democracy, in 1920, at a time when the Kuomintang was actively struggling against several regional warlords to reunify China as a democratic republic.
Quo Tai-chi held a variety of posts, including commissioner of foreign affairs of the "Canton government" in 1927 and Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  In 1929, he resigned the post of vice-minister of foreign affairs in protest of the placement of so many former imperial and warlord bureaucrats in the Kuomintang's Nanking (Nanjing) government, but was convinced to return. During one of his tenures as Vice-Minister, he was beaten by an angry, nationalist mob in Shanghai in May 1932 for his decision to sign an armistice with the Japanese, who were continuously pushing further into Chinese territory. He signed the armistice from the hospital, but resigned his post that year.
From 1932 to 1940, Quo served as the first Chinese representative to Britain elevated from minister/legate to ambassador. He worked tirelessly to make China's case against Japan's continued, aggressive expansion in northern China at a time when the British were far more concerned with fascist acts of war on the Continent. He also lobbied for an end to British arms sales to the Japanese, whose airplanes, armed with British guns, were killing countless civilians in China even before war was declared. While ambassador to Court of St. James, Quo also signed treaties of amity between China and the republics of Latvia and Estonia.
In April 1941, Quo was named to replace Wang Ch'ung-hui as foreign minister by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. During his time as foreign minister, he negotiated an end to the special, extraterritorial rights exercised by the United States and United Kingdom in China since the mid-19th century. It was also he who, on December 8, 1941, confirmed that the Republic of China was officially at war with not only Empire of Japan, but also Nazi Germany and Kingdom of Italy.
Quo represented China at the newly formed United Nations in San Francisco in 1946. He also presided over the first session of the U.N. Security Council held in March 1946 in New York. In November 1947, Y.P. Tsiang was named permanent Chief Chinese Delegate to the United Nations, replacing Quo. In December 1947, Quo was appointed Chinese ambassador to Brazil, replacing Cheng Tien-ku. He could remain the seat of China in the UN despite the communists' dominance in Mainland China and the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
Quo died on February 29, 1952 in Santa Barbara, California.  He was 63.

[[Prevalence of mental disorders]]

CATEGORIES: Epidemiology of psychiatric conditions

The prevalence of mental disorders has been studied around the world, providing estimates on how common mental disorders are. Different criteria or thresholds of severity have sometimes been used. 
National and international figures are typically estimated by large-scale surveys of self-reported symptoms up to the time of assessment; sometimes a figure is calculated for the occurrence of disorder in the week, month or year prior to assessment–a point or period prevalence; sometimes the figure is for a person's lifetime prior to assessment–the so-called lifetime prevalence.

The Cangarda is a [tpl]convert|126|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] long luxury steam yacht built in 1901, at the Pusey and Jones Shipyard in Wilmington, Delaware.
In the late 19th and early 20th century, huge fortunes were made prior to US income taxation.  Opulence in homes and yachting reached a peak; many small private steamships like Cangarda were produced in the US, Britain and Germany for the very wealthy.  However, Cangarda is the last surviving US-built steam yacht in the US, and one of only three left in the world.
After years of service in roles from opulence to indignity, the yacht sank in the Boston Harbor in 1999 in poor repair, but has since been completely restored at Richmond, California for use as a private yacht and periodic museum ship.  She will be a part-time feature of the maritime museum at Mystic, Connecticut.

Frederick Alfred Rhead (1856–1933) was a potter working in North Staffordshire, England.  He is not to be confused with his son Frederick Hurten Rhead (1880–1942) who was also a potter, and who worked mainly in the USA. His other children included the pottery designer Charlotte Rhead.
Rhead's father, G.W. Rhead, worked in the pottery industry, and young Frederick was apprenticed at Mintons Ltd. He was one of a number of apprentices who in the 1870s learnt the art of pâte-sur-pâte decoration from Marc-Louis Solon, a French émigré who was the leading exponent of this ceramic technique.  Rhead continued to work in pâte-sur-pâte after leaving Minton. He joined Wedgwood and went on to work at a number of potteries including a failed venture of his own.  His most famous piece of ceramics is the "Gladstone Vase" which was presented to William Ewart Gladstone by the Liberals of Burslem in 1888.  The vase is on public view, having been loaned to the Gladstone Pottery Museum in Longton, Staffordshire.
Besides working in three dimensions as a ceramic designer, Rhead worked in two dimensions as a graphic designer, although in the latter field he was somewhat overshadowed by his brother Louis Rhead who pursued a successful career in the USA. The three brothers Frederick, Louis and George Woolliscroft Rhead Jr collaborated on book illustration projects, for example an edition of The Pilgrim's Progress.

Betsy Gray (died 1798), was an Ulster-Scots Presbyterian peasant girl from outside Lisburn in Co. Antrim in what is today Northern Ireland who was killed as part of the 1798 Rebellion of the United Irishmen. She is the subject of many folk ballads and poems written since her time down to the present day. 
She fought in the Battle of Ballynahinch against the Yeomanry, and was killed in retreat along with her brother and lover, having her right hand cut off before being decapitated.
She is a folk hero to all Republicans in Ulster, with both loyalists and republicans claiming her as their own, as typified by the centenary celebrations in 1898 where locals broke a monument to her sooner than let Nationalists, who travelled from Belfast, have a ceremony in her honour.Bartlett/Dawson/Keough: Thomas Bartlett, Kevin Dawson, Daire Keogh, The 1798 Rebellion: An Illustrated History, Roberts Rinehart, 1998, p.172

[[Historiography of the Volyn tragedy]]
CATEGORIES: History of Ukraine, Historiography of specific subject matter, World War II crimes in Poland, Poland–Ukraine relations, Volhynia, Massacres of Poles in Volhynia

This article presents the historiography of the Volyn tragedy as presented by historians in Poland and Ukraine after World War II. The Massacres of Poles in Volhynia were part of the ethnic cleansing operation in the Polish province of Eastern Galicia and Volhynia (now in western Ukraine) that took place beginning in March 1943 and lasted until the end of 1944.  According to political scientist Nathaniel Copsey, research into this event is quite partisan (with some exceptions) and dominated by Polish researchers, some of whom lived there at the time or are descended from those who did. The most thorough is the work of Ewa and Władysław Siemaszko, the result of years of research conducted with the goal of demonstrating that the Poles were victims of genocide. Nonetheless, the 45 years of state censorship resulted in an excessive supply of works described as "heavy in narrative", "light in analysis" and "inherently - though perhaps unconsciously - biased against Ukrainians."Nathaniel Copsey. (2009). Public opinion and the making of foreign policy in the 'New Europe': a comparative study of Poland and Ukraine Ashgate Publishing, pp88-89 Copsey writes that "it is very hard to find a neutral account of this period"

[[Symphony No. 10 (Myaskovsky)]]
CATEGORIES: Symphonies by Nikolai Myaskovsky

The Symphony No. 10 in F minor, Op. 30 by Nikolai Myaskovsky is among the more remarkable of the Russian composer's large output of 27 symphonies.
Composed in Moscow in 1926–27, it was inspired by Alexander Pushkin's poem The Bronze Horseman, which tells of a young man whose fiancée is drowned by the disastrous flooding of Saint Petersburg by the River Neva in 1824 and who curses the prominent equestrian statue of Peter the Great, only to be pursued through the city by the statue until he too is drowned. 
The basic events of the poem may be discerned in Miaskovsky’s music, notably the flood in the opening passage (marked Tumultuoso), plus themes for the principal characters (the sole lyrical element, played Patetico on solo woodwind or violin, symbolizes the drowned fiancée) and the pursuit by the statue, a Presto Tempestoso fugue on a subject using ten of the twelve pitches of the chromatic scale. In fact Miaskovsky was not so much inspired by the poem as by Alexander Benois's illustrations to it.
In its form Miaskovsky's Tenth Symphony "collapses the elements of a four-movement symphony into a densely argued single-movement form lasting little more than quarter of an hour".Malcolm MacDonald, liner notes to Warner Classics 2564 63431-2. 
It requires a large orchestra, rich in brass instruments. Miaskovsky commented that the symphony was "filled with the deafening racket of four trumpets, eight horns and so on" and described it to Sergei Prokofiev as being "as massive as if it were made of iron". 
The premiere was given in Moscow on 2 April 1928 by the conductorless orchestra Persimfans, but the complexity of the music defeated them. In 1930 Prokofiev managed to persuade Leopold Stokowski to give a well-received U.S. premiere in Philadelphia.

[tpl]nihongo|Sōgen-ji|崇元寺|[/tpl] was a Buddhist temple and royal mausoleum of the Ryūkyū Kingdom, located in Naha, Okinawa. It was erected during the reign of King Shō Shin (r. 1477-1526), and destroyed in the 1945 battle of Okinawa.
In 1496, memorial tablets representing the kings of the Ryūkyū Kingdom were installed in the temple, establishing it as a royal mausoleum. Anyone entering the temple grounds, including the king himself, had to dismount and enter the temple on foot out of respect for the prior sovereigns. The temple grounds were expanded at this time as well, with the construction of the massive stone gates and walls which remain today.[tpl]cite book|last=Kerr|first=George|title=Okinawa|year=2000|publisher=Tuttle Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=0804820872|edition=Revised|authorlink=George H.

All the temple buildings were destroyed in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945; only the stone walls and gates, foundations and steps, and some tablets and steles survived. Of two stone tablets erected outside the gates warning visitors to dismount, one remains today. The site is today a public park.

[[Methanesulfonic acid]]

CATEGORIES: Sulfonic acids, Reagents for organic chemistry

Methanesulfonic acid is a colorless liquid with the chemical formula CH3SO3H. It is the simplest of the alkylsulfonic acids. Salts and esters of methanesulfonic acid are known as mesylates (or methanesulfonates, as in ethyl methanesulfonate). Methanesulfonic acid is used as an acid catalyst in organic reactions because it is a non-volatile, strong acid that is soluble in organic solvents. Methanesulfonic acid is convenient for industrial applications because it is liquid at ambient temperature, while the closely related p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) is solid. However, in a laboratory setting, solid PTSA is more convenient.
Methanesulfonic acid may be considered an intermediate compound between sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and methylsulfonylmethane ((CH3)2SO2), effectively replacing an -OH group with a -CH3 group at each step. This pattern can extend no further in either direction without breaking down the -SO2 group.
Methanesulfonic acid can be used in the generation of borane (BH3). By reacting methanesulfonic acid with NaBH4 in an aprotic solvent such as THF or DMS, the complex of BH3 and the solvent is formed.[tpl]cite journal | journal = Org. Proc. Res.

European Combined Geodetic Network (ECGN) is a research project aimed at high accuracy geoid determination. The purpose of ECGN is to connect the height systems obtained via geometric positioning by GNSS with gravity-referenced heights with a cm-level accuracy. The effects of the atmosphere, the oceans and time-dependent parameters of the solid Earth on the gravity field are investigated. ECGN uses the data of satellite gravity missions CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE to model the Earth's gravity field and is linked to other gravity-related projects (GMES, GEOSS, GGOS). The ECGN is considered as a European contribution to the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) project Global Geodetic Observation System (GGOS). ECGN is managed by EUREF.J. Ihde, T. Baker, C.

The campus of Belmont Middle School is one of only five sites in the United States of "The Spirit of the Fighting Yank," a sculpture by Ernest Moore Viquesney. Based on the original created in 1943, this cast-zinc statue portrays a determined-looking GI carrying a Thompson sub-machine gun by his left side (later lost in the case of this statue, now sporting a wooden block), about to lob a grenade with his right hand. While Viquesney produced many GI-themed pieces with the coming of World War II, most of them were miniatures and this was the only one produced as a life-size monument. It is believed to have been cast by the Raphael Groppi Studio of Chicago, Illinois. This particular statue was dedicated in 1946 after Viquesney's death.Spirit of the Fighting Yank - Belmont, NC, retrieved on 2009-05-10.WWII Monument in Belmont, NC, retrieved on 2008-07-26.

John Chavis Middle School was formerly John Chavis High School, a racially-segregated school for African-American students from western Gaston County.  The school graduated its first students in 1938.  It originally housed grades one through eleven in the one main building.  An addition was added in 1954.  After a fire destroyed the main building in 1964, classes were temporarily held in two black churches and the Rhyne Houser Recreational Building.  The class of 1964 held graduation exercises at Lincoln High School in Bessemer City.  Classes resumed at the new school in the fall of 1964. Only two classes graduated from the new John Chavis High School. During the summer of 1966, the Cherryville School System became fully integrated.History of John Chavis High School, Cherryville.com. Retrieved on 2008-07-26.
From 1966, John Chavis School became Cherryville South Elementary School, housing students in grades three and four. In 1973, grades five and six were added. With the start of the 1997 school year, the building was remodeled and became a middle school for grades 6 to 8 and reclaimed the name of John Chavis.

Konstantin Stepanovich Kuzakov (1911-1996) ([tpl]lang-ru|Константин Степанович Кузаков[/tpl]Kuzakov Konstantin Stepanovich [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]) was possibly the illegitimate second child of Joseph Stalin.  Konstantin's mother was Maria Kuzakova, who was Stalin's landlady during his 1911 exile in Solvychegodsk, with whom he had an affair.  His mother was still pregnant when Stalin left his exile.Simon Sebag-Montefiore: Young Stalin. Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN 978-1-4000-4465-8.
Konstantin was enrolled into Leningrad University, possibly with the discreet help of his father.  In 1932, the NKVD forced him to sign a statement promising never to reveal the truth of his parentage.
For a while, he taught philosophy at the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute.  Afterward, he got a job in the Central Committee's apparat in Moscow.  He served as a colonel during World War II.  In 1947, while working for Andrei Zhdanov, a very close ally of Stalin, he and his deputy were accused of being American spies.  While he was never officially introduced to his possible father, Konstantin claimed that on one occasion while working in the Kremlin he said, "Stalin stopped and looked at me and I felt he wanted to tell me something.  I wanted to rush to him, but something stopped me.  He waved his pipe and moved on." Although Stalin prevented his arrest, he was nonetheless dismissed from the Communist Party. 
After Stalin's death and the arrest of Lavrentiy Beria, he was restored in the Party and in Soviet "apparat", holding various positions associated with culture, a member of the collegium of Gosteleradio, chief of a department in the Ministry of Culture, etc. He died in 1996.

The Armenian Apostolic Church is officially recognised under Israel's confessional system, for the self-regulation of status issues, such as marriage and divorce. 
Archbishop Nourhan Manougian, Grand Sacristan and Patriarchal Vicar of the Patriarchate, was elected as the 97th Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem on January 24, 2013.http://uk.news.yahoo.com/jerusalem-armenian-patriarch-elected-120102588.html Manougian succeeds Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, who died on October 12, 2012 after serving 22 years as the 96th Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem. The Patriarch, along with a Synod of seven clergymen elected by the St. James Brotherhood, oversees the Patriarchate's operations. 
As a result of the persecution of Armenians by Turkey during World War I, the Armenian population of Jerusalem reached 25,000 people. But political and economic instability in the region have decimated the number. In 2001, there were about 2,500 Armenians living in Jerusalem, most of them living in and around the Patriarchate at the St. James Monastery, which occupies most of the Armenian Quarter of the Old City. A few thousand live in Jaffa, Haifa and Nazareth, and only a handful in the Palestinian Territories. Most Armenians living previously in the West Bank, have left the country.
In Jerusalem the Armenian community continues to follow the Julian calendar, unlike the rest of the Armenian Church and other Eastern Orthodox Churches which follow the Revised Julian calendar.Jerusalem Post, January 20, 2006 - Merry Christmas in Jerusalem again - and again

[[Nutritious Rice for the World]]
CATEGORIES: Rice

Nutritious Rice for the World is a World Community Grid research project in the field of agronomy led by the Samudrala Computational Biology Research Group at the University of Washington. It was launched on May 12, 2008.http://www.t4tcolorado.org/story/nutritious-rice-worldResearch Projects Page on World Community Grid The objective of this project is to predict the structure of proteins of major strains of rice. The intent is to help farmers breed better rice strains with higher crop yields, promote greater disease and pest resistance, and utilize a full range of bioavailable nutrients that can benefit people around the world, especially in regions where malnutrition is a critical concern.
Determining the structure of proteins is an extremely difficult and expensive process. Though it is possible to computationally predict a protein's structure from its corresponding DNA sequence, there are thousands of distinct proteins found in rice. This presents a computational challenge that a single computer cannot solve within a reasonable timeframe.Project Page on World Community Grid Website
Once that the entire rice genome had been sequenced, the effort shifted to identifying genes that are involved in increased yield, disease resistance and nutritional value. This problem is made more difficult because very few cereal plants have been sequenced, and therefore, many of the rice genes do not resemble any genes of known function. The Computational Biology Research Group at the University of Washington developed the Protinfo software, which can produce protein structures at a fraction of the cost and time.
Protinfo is being used to create three-dimensional models of the tens of thousands of rice proteins. These models are then used to predict the function of each protein and to understand the role of the gene that encodes it. The models, and any analysis resulting from examining them, will be housed at the Bioverse database and webserver, which is a comprehensive framework to relate molecules such as proteins and DNA to an organism's pathways and systems.
Volunteers' computers on World Community Grid will run the Protinfo software to create models of all proteins encoded by the rice genome whose structure can be predicted reliably. These models will be analyzed to choose the best ones. From the resulting structures, prediction tools will determine the function of each protein and the role of the gene that encodes it. Using the power of Protinfo, World Community Grid will initially examine over 10,000 genes, and produce 100,000 models per gene.
Eventually, the structures of 30,000 to 60,000 proteins will be studied.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=112441&org=NSF|title=Using Your Computer to Grow More Nutritious Rice for a Hungry World|publisher=NSF[/tpl]  Generating one billion models on the 320 CPU cluster at the Computational Biology Research Group was anticipated to take about 30 years to accomplish; however, using World Community Grid took only about two years working at 167 TFLOPS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/24202.wss|title=IBM World Community Grid "Supercomputer" to Tackle Rice Crisis[/tpl]  The distributed computing function was suspended in April 2010 while in-house analysis of results continues.  The DC function will resume when funding is secured for further phases.
The resulting knowledge base will hopefully lead to the development of improved hybrids of rice strains with higher yield, greater disease and pest resistance, and a full range of bioavailable nutrients. This knowledge can also be extended to other food crops such as wheat and maize.About The Project page on WCG

[[Mitzi Shore]]
CATEGORIES: Living people, 1930 births

A Wisconsin native born in 1930, Mitzi Shore (née Saidel) co-founded the Los Angeles comedy club, The Comedy Store in 1972 and took over operation of The Comedy Store in 1974. Through the club, she has had a huge influence on the careers of up-and-coming comedians for decades. Now-famous comedians like Robin Williams, Freddie Prinze, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Chevy Chase, Sam Kinison, and Jim Carrey have all worked at the Comedy Store for Mitzi Shore. Mitzi also founded Comedy Channel Inc in 1982.
Her former husband, Sammy Shore, is also a comedian. The couple have four children: Peter, Scott, actor Pauly and daughter Sandy.Pauly Shore harnesses his roots
Mitzi Shore's ownership of the Comedy Store has long been a source of contention between members of the Shore family. Sammy and Mitzi co-founded the Comedy Store in 1972. Mitzi is credited for coining the now-famous club's title. When Sammy and Mitzi divorced in 1974, Mitzi acquired complete ownership as part of their divorce settlement. Sammy Shore was later quoted in 2003 by the Los Angeles Times as explaining that he "relinquished control of the club to lower his alimony payments".
Mitzi's contribution to the club's ongoing survival and day to day management extended far beyond a lucky inheritance. Shortly after she took full control, Mitzi was able to obtain a significant cash loan from comedian Shecky Greene to help ensure continued operations (comedy clubs have never been viewed by sound investments by traditional creditors). Mitzi's bookings were as non-traditional as her financing. As early as 1978, Shore had converted the upstairs section of The Comedy Store into the "Belly Room": a 50 seat audience for which she exclusively booked female comedians. At the time, professional comedy was very much a "boy's club", and bookings for comediennes were rare; opportunities for women to perform their own stand-up material under the same roof as the most popular comics in the country was unheard of. Mitzi's liberal risk-taking with booking talent has continued for decades. In the 90's, once female comics had become more established, Shore continued to cross boundaries with her audience by creating specialty nights for Latino, and gay and lesbian performers.
In 1989, Mitzi Shore retained counsel James Blancarte and sued HBO for copyright infringement. Shore had owned ad operated Comedy Channel Inc since 1982 - a company established to create and sell video tapes of performances at The Comedy Store. 1989 was the year that HBO would launch their (ultimately ill-fated) premium cable service "The Comedy Channel". Shore's suit claimed HBO's service was an "indirect unauthorized use" of the name and trademark "Comedy Channel".
Later in her life, Mitzi Shore has sadly acquired Parkinson's disease. This would leave to more conflicts to determine who should operate the Comedy Store during times when she required treatment. Initially, responsibility for the club's operations went to brothers Pauly Shore suing his brother Peter Shore. However in December 2009, Pauly sued his brother Peter. The lawsuit alleged that Peter, a psychologist, had exerted "undue influence" on Mitzi during a period of convalescence and was "abusing his filial relationship" with their mother.
Tom Hanks' Playtone Company is in pre-production of a movie based on Mitzi Shore's life and impact on American Comedy.

The Honourable Anne Poulett (11 July 1711 – 5 July 1785), fourth son of John Poulett, 1st Earl Poulett, was a British Member of Parliament who represented the borough of Bridgwater in the House of Commons for sixteen years until his death in 1785. He received his unusual first name in honour of Queen Anne, who was his sponsor at his baptism.
He initially stood for election at Bridgwater in 1768, and although he was initially declared defeated the result was reversed on petition the following year. He was returned unopposed in 1774 and headed the poll at contested elections in 1780 and 1784. Throughout his career he was generally a supporter of Lord North, though occasionally voting against him.
In 1780 he presented to St Mary's Church in Bridgwater a magnificent 17th-century painting of The Descent from the Cross, apparently captured when a Spanish warship was taken a prize. The artist is unknown, although it has been controversially attributed to Murillo. The picture is now used as the altarpiece of the church.

Heatwave is the fifth album by Belgian RIO band Univers Zero. Released in 1986, the album is a continued exploration of the Middle Eastern influences, which first appeared on Uzed. The instrumentation here is more electronic than in their previous works. The album was recorded and mixed by Didier de Roos at Daylight Studio, Brussels.
The album is unusual among Univers Zero albums in that drummer/bandleader Daniel Denis did not write the majority of the material. Keyboardist Andy Kirk takes the compositional lead instead, penning both the title track and "The Funeral Plain." The latter is notable for being the second longest Univers Zero song (Only the track "La Faulx", off the Heresie album, is longer). "The Funeral Plain" is dedicated to "all living hardships that lead into self-awareness." The band would not release their next album, The Hard Quest, until 1999. Denis temporarily broke up the band after the release of Heatwave due to financial difficulties and tension within the group.[tpl]cite web|author=Daniel Denis, Renato Moraes, Michael Bohn, Philippe Senynaeve |url=http://univers-zero.com/history.htm |title=The official homepage |publisher=Univers Zero |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1974 births, Living people, Iranian poets, Persian-language poets, People from Tehran, Iranian women writers

Pegāh Ahmadi ([tpl]lang-fa|پگاه احمدی[/tpl]) (born 1974) is an Iranian poet, scholar, literary critic and translator of poetry.
Pegah Ahmadi was born in Tehran. She began writing poetry at the age of seven. At seventeen she made her début as a poet by the publication of a poem in the literary magazine Takāpu, edited by Mansur Kushān. Since then she has regularly contributed to literary magazines inside Iran.  She has studied Persian Literature at University of Tehran.
Pegah Ahamdi has published four books of poetry, On the Final Sol G (1999), Cadence (2001), Writing Footnotes on the Wall of the Family Home (200?), and My These Days Is Throat The actual title of this book is In Ruzhā'yam Galust (این روزهایم گلوست). The accuracy of the translation My These Days Is Throat is to be ascertained. (2004). Her fifth book of poems, To Find Faults The actual title of this book is Āhu Khāni (آهوخوانی). Since the writer of these lines is not familiar with this book, the translation To Find Faults is likely to be inaccurate. The following considerations have underlined this translation. According to Dehkhoda in Loghat'nāmeh-ye Dehkhoda (3rd Edition, Tehran University Press, 2006), Āhu (not to be confused with the same word in the meaning of Gazelle) consists of Ā and Huk, where Ā negates the meaning of Huk. Thus Āhu means Fault, Shortcoming, Error or Wrongdoing. The word Khāni refers to Khāndan, To Read. It is therefore very conceivable that Āhu Khāni refers to the disagreeable act or habit of reminding others of their shortcomings or mistakes. Whence the present translation To Find Faults. will be published in the course of this year (2008). She has further published two works of translation from English into Persian, one an anthology of the poems by Sylvia Plath, with the title The Love Song of the Insane Girl (2000), and the other, a translation of the book Haiku: Poetry Ancient and Modern, by Jakie Hardy, with the title Hundred and One Haikus, From Past to Present (2007). Ms Ahmadi's scholarly book Women's Poetry from the Beginning to the Present Day was published by Nashr-e Sāles (Sāles Publications) in 2005. The first volume of Ms Ahmadi's second scholarly book A Comprehensive Anthology of the Poetry by Iranian Women, will be published shorty by Cheshmeh Publications.
Ms Ahmadi has published over sixty articles on subject matters related to criticism of verse, theoretical issues pertaining to poetry and translation of poems in such monthly and quarterly arts and literary magazines as Dourān, Kārnāmeh, Kelk, Jahān-e Ketāb, Bokhārā, Bidār, Sabk-e Nou, Film, Zanān, Thursday Evening, Āzarang, Nāfeh, Shoukarān, Āzmā, Negāh-e Nou, Payām-e Shomāl and Pāprik.

As described by one insect-breeding hobbyist, this species:
 ...is one of the most impressive of all mimic species. It takes the form of a leaf one step further than any other species, and has the largest hood of all leaf species. They take the form of a flat stance, and spend most of their time low-lying, to help blend in with their background. This mantis species is rare in captivity, and only experienced breeders will have these available/have reared them successfully in the past.http://www.insectstore.com/choeradodis_stallii_tropical_shield_mantis.php Choeradodis Stallii - Tropical Shield Mantis 
Nymphs of this species are born with a bright red color distinguishing it from other Choeradodis. Even at early instars, it displays somewhat of a hood. Each time the mantis moults, it grows more greenish and the hood grows larger until it reaches adulthood.http://www.insectstore.com/choeradodis_stallii_tropical_shield_mantis.php Choeradodis Stallii - Tropical Shield Mantis

[[One Hot Minute Tour]]

The One Hot Minute Tour (also known as The Wild Tour) was a concert tour by the Red Hot Chili Peppers from 1995-1997 to support their album One Hot Minute. This was the first and only major tour guitarist Dave Navarro  performed on with the band. The One Hot Minute era got off to a rocky start with extensive delays in recording; once the tour was underway there was a variety of mishaps and upheavals that at one point caused Flea to rethink being part the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The U.S. leg of the tour was intended to start in 1995 however was postponed to the following year because drummer Chad Smith broke his arm in a baseball game. A total of 33 dates were canceled due various other problems including a broken arm suffered by singer Anthony Kiedis which eventually led to another drug relapse. Lack of chemistry with Navarro was also a major problem since he joined the band and continued to become a problem as the tour went on. Navarro played his final show with the band in July 1997 during a massive rain storm which cut the band's set short. After spending the entire year of 1997 doing nothing and making some minor attempts to record new music, Navarro was eventually let go in early 1998 and replaced not long after by a returning John Frusciante who quit the band in 1992.

The Godoberi are one of the Andi-Dido peoples of Dagestan.  They numbered 1,425 in 1926 and about 4,500 in 2007. They live mainly in the three villages of Godoberi (abt 2500), Ziberkhali (abt 60) and Beledi (abt 10) in the Botlikh district.  About 1800 Godoberis live on the plains of Dagestan in Terechnoye (close to the city of Khasavyurt).
Most Godoberi are followers of Sunni Islam.  They had their own feudal free community that had a loose relationship with the Avar Khanate prior to the annexation of the area to Russia in 1806.  
During the transition from Czarist to Communist rule many Godoberi became involved in nationalistic and pan-Islamic movements.  Among these were Firkatul-Vedzhan.  Large numbers of the supporters of such movements were killed by Soviet authorities around 1930.

Steamboats played a major role in the 19th-century development of the Mississippi River and its tributaries by allowing the practical large-scale transport of passengers and freight both up- and down-river.  Using steam power, riverboats were developed during that time which could navigate in shallow waters as well as upriver against strong currents.  After the development of railroads passenger traffic gradually switched to this faster form of transportation, but steamboats continued to serve Mississippi River commerce into the early 20th Century.

It was the first and one of the most famous election watch campaign.[tpl]cite book|last=Hedman|first=Eva-Lotta E.|title=In the name of civil society : from free election movements to people power in the Philippines|year=2006|publisher=Univ. of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=0824829212|accessdate=25 February 2013|chapter=1.

NAMREL was co-founded by Jose S. Concepcion, Jr., and was its first National Chairperson. NAMFREL was formally organized in October 1983 as an offshoot of the New Voters Registration Committee, which was formed in the 1960s. It currently has the support of more than 140 benefactors and 125 organizations. Its current national chairperson is Corazon Dela Paz-Bernardo.
NAMFREL's goal is to ensure "free, orderly and honest elections" in the Philippines. It is a non-partisan organization with over 250,000 member-volunteers from different religious, civic, business, professional, labor, youth, educational, and non-government organizations.
The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has accredited NAMFREL as its "citizens' arm" since 1986 to conduct manual parallel counts, which it called "Operation Quick Count." In 1986, NAMFREL mobilized 500,000 volunteers nationwide to guard the snap presidential elections. President Ferdinand Marcos declared himself the winner of the election; the NAMFREL count, however, showed that Corazon Aquino won. In the days that followed, the EDSA People Power revolt took place, sweeping Aquino to power.
For the May 2010 automated Philippine presidential elections NAMFREL was not accredited to conduct its own count. Instead, the organization conducted a nationwide election observation mission called "Bantay ng Bayan" ("sentinels of the people").
Presently, NAMFREL is also active internationally, its officers and volunteers having worked as trainers, observer team members, election administrators and resource persons in 35 countries, and have sent its volunteers as the official Philippine observer delegation to Cambodia during the 1998 parliamentary elections there, as well as in Indonesia in 1999 for the Presidential elections after the fall of Suharto.http://www.namfrel.com.ph/v2/aboutus/history.php
In 1998, NAMFREL representatives attended the International IDEA conference in Copenhagen.

Portuguese Australians are either Portuguese living in Australia or native Australians with Portuguese ancestry.
Despite their rather modest number compared to the Greek and Italian communities, Portuguese Australians form a very organised, self-conscious and active community in many fields of Australian life. With a population spread over many parts of the continent, sporting teams, social clubs,"List of numerous Portuguese Social Clubs and institutions based in Australia (Portuguese)" radio shows,"SBS Radio – Portuguese" newspapers,"Portuguese Consulate – New South Wales" outdoor cultural festivals,"Portuguese Festival at Petersham, Sydney – Youtube" culinary feasts, and even a traditional ethnic neighbourhood, the ever-growing Portuguese Australians form roughly 0.4 of Australia's population. The biggest Portuguese Australian community is in Petersham, Sydney: but there are other communities around Australia such as Melbourne,"Portuguese Association of Victoria" Wollongong, Newcastle and Perth."Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade – Australian Government""Portuguese Consulate – Western Australia" There are also communities present, to a lesser extent, in Brisbane,"The Brisbane Portuguese Family Center (Portuguese)""The Brisbane Portuguese Family Center (Portuguese)" Adelaide and Darwin."Department of the Chief Minister, Northern Territory – Australian Government" (PDF) There are approximately 56,000 Portuguese migrants and Australians with Portuguese heritage in Australia.
Portuguese cuisine has also made its way into mainstream Australian society, with the fast expansion and establishment of restaurant and fast food outlets such as "Nando's", "Oporto" and "Ogalo" to confirm its success. The Portuguese "pastel de nata" is a very popular delicacy in Australia and is commonly found throughout the country.
One of the most high-visibility moments for the Portuguese community was in 2005, when António Milhinhos, a shopkeeper from Darwin, was awarded the Senior Australian of the Year Award for his outstanding charity works and continuous catastrophe relief since 1983."Australian of the Year Awards"

[[Partial regression plot]]
CATEGORIES: Statistical charts and diagrams, Regression diagnostics

In applied statistics, a partial regression plot attempts to show the effect of adding an additional variable to the model (given that one or more independent variables are already in the model). Partial regression plots are also referred to as added variable plots, adjusted variable plots, and individual coefficient plots.
When performing a linear regression with a single independent variable, a scatter plot of the response variable against the independent variable provides a good indication of the nature of the relationship. If there is more than one independent variable, things become more complicated. Although it can still be useful to generate scatter plots of the response variable against each of the independent variables, this does not take into account the effect of the other independent variables in the model.
Partial regression plots are formed by:
Velleman and Welsch (see References below) express this mathematically as:
where
Velleman and Welsch list the following useful properties for this plot:
Partial regression plots are widely discussed in the regression diagnostics literature (e.g., see the References section below). Since the strengths and weaknesses of partial regression plots are widely discussed in the literature, we will not discuss that in any detail here.
Partial regression plots are related to, but distinct from, partial residual plots. Partial regression plots are most commonly used to identify data points with high leverage and influential data points that might not have high leverage. Partial residual plots are most commonly used to identify the nature of the relationship between Y and Xi (given the effect of the other independent variables in the model). Note that since the simple correlation between the two sets of residuals plotted is equal to the partial correlation between the response variable and Xi, partial regression plots will show the correct strength of the linear relationship between the response variable and Xi. This is not true for partial residual plots. On the other hand, for the partial regression plot, the x-axis is not Xi. This limits its usefulness in determining the need for a transformation (which is the primary purpose of the partial residual plot).

In computational complexity theory and analysis of algorithms, a number of metrics are defined describing the resources, such as time or space, that a machine needs to solve a particular problem.

This article describes a number of important pieces of context and how they affect metrics.

[[Chala Kazak]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups in Kyrgyzstan

The Chala Kazak are a group of Kazaks who live in Kyrgyzstan and now consider themselves to be Kyrgyz. However they do not belong to any of the three main Kirgiz tribes.
The word Shala Kazak has a second meaning in Kazakhstan. It means part of the Kazak society who don't know their native language well or don't know it at all - the Qazaq language.
The actual translation for "shala" or "chala" is half. Thus, the whole meaning is "half kazak", i.e. the person who does not know and does not like his/her native language. The word is considered to be derogatory/ demeaning, shameful term for Kazaks.
There is a main reason that there are so many Kazak people who don't know and, sometime, hate their own native language - due to the heavy mass russification of all non-Slavic nations and minorities in the Soviet Union, many Kazaks forgot their language. Shala Kazaks still constitute a big proportion of all Kazaks in the contemporary Kazakhstan Community.

CATEGORIES: Canadian commissions and inquiries, Canadian media regulation

The Royal Commission on Newspapers, popularly known as the Kent Commission, was a Canadian Royal Commission chaired by Tom Kent. It was created in 1980 in response to growing concerns over concentration of media ownership in Canada. The Commission's final report was delivered in 1981.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/PROGS/AC-CA/PROGS/ESM-MS/prob4_e.cfm |title=Concentration of Newspaper Ownership |accessdate=2008-07-26 |format= |work=Canadian Heritage website [/tpl]
Much of the impetus for the creation of the commission was the virtually simultaneous closure, on August 26–27, 1980, of two major daily newspapers: the Ottawa Journal (owned by the Thomson Corporation) and the Winnipeg Tribune (owned by Southam Inc.). These closures gave each chain a monopoly in the two markets, Southam with the Ottawa Citizen and Thomson with the Winnipeg Free Press. The resulting allegations of collusion prompted the Canadian government to launch the Kent Commission.

[[Partial leverage]]
CATEGORIES: Regression diagnostics

In statistics, high-leverage points are those that are outliers with respect to the independent variables. Leverage points are those that cause large changes in the parameter estimates when they are deleted. Although an influential point will typically have high leverage, a high leverage point is not necessarily an influential point.  The leverage is typically defined as the diagonal of the hat matrix
Partial leverage is used to measure the contribution of the individual independent variables to the leverage of each observation. That is, if hi is the ith row of the diagonal of the hat matrix, the partial leverage is a measure of how hi changes as a variable is added to the regression model.
The partial leverage is computed as:
where
Note that the partial leverage is the leverage of the ith point in the partial regression plot for the jth variable. Data points with large partial leverage for an independent variable can exert undue influence on the selection of that variable in automatic regression model building procedures.

Fland Dá Chongal or Flann Ua Congaile (flourished late 7th century) was a king of the Uí Failge, a Laigin people of County Offaly.
Fland is not mentioned in the annals of Ireland but appears in king lists and genealogies. The king lists in the Book of Leinster place his reign before Cillíne mac Forannáin (died 652), however the death obits of his sons would place his reign later. He was most likely a contemporary of Cellach Cualann (died 715), king of Leinster and the predecessor of Forbassach Ua Congaile (died 714).Mac Niocaill, pg.113 Forbasach ruled for three years according to the Book of Leinster and Fland for fourteen years which gives a possible reign of 697-711 for Fland.
Fland was the great great grandson of a brother of Áed Róin mac Cathail (died 604), a previous king.Mac Niocaill, pg.92 Fland had twelve children by at least three different wives:Rawlinson Genealogies, pg.58-59
Four of Fland's sons were slain at the Battle of Áth Senaig in 738 when the men of Leinster were crushed by the high king Áed Allán.Mac Niocaill. pg.125; Byrne, pg.147; Ó Cróinín, pg.200 fland's descendants were known as the Uí Flaind.

The East Anglian Waterways Association is a waterway society and an umbrella organisation in East Anglia, England, UK.
The association was founded on 18 April 1958, and  it campaigns for the preservation, restoration and good management of the tidal and inland waterways in East Anglia. One of its early projects was an investigation into the complex legal status of the staithes or landing stages on the Norfolk Broads, which was carried out in the 1960s. The research paved the way for many of the staithes to be adopted by the Broads Authority, and retained as public access points to the waterways.Inland Waterways of Great Britain, (2009), Jane Cumberlidge, 8th Edition, Imray Norie Laurie and Wilson, ISBN 978-1-84623-010-3

[[Slew (spacecraft)]]

CATEGORIES: Spaceflight concepts

[tpl]Other uses|Slew (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Slew[/tpl]

Slew and slewing are a terms which can refer to a spacecraft's orientation or movement in reference to a plane or fixed position such as Earth, the Sun, another celestial body or other point in space.[tpl]cite web|url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14805|title=PIA14805: A Sideways Glance|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/articles/tycho-central-peak-spectacular|title=Tycho Central Peak Spectacular!|publisher=NASA's Lunar Science Institute|accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/3590.gcn3|title=GCN GRB Observation Report|publisher=NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl]
During space flight, a craft's attitude must be controlled for reasons dependant upon the craft's mission. Keeping a  spacecraft slewed properly is vital toward ensuring that its high-gain antenna remains oriented toward Earth for sending and receiving data and commands. Additionally with many craft, keeping their solar arrays angled toward the Sun optimizes their power absorption and reduces the craft's reliance on internal power systems. Thermal heating and cooling of a craft and its subsystems can also be controlled by the craft's orientation. Cameras or other sensing equipment that are fixed into position upon the craft need to be aimed by slewing the craft.  A spacecraft can either be spin stabilized or 3-axis stabilized to maintain proper orientation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-2.php|title=Basics of Space Flight: Section II|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl]
For spin-stabilized spacecraft, slewing is accomplished by applying a (significant) torque to the spacecraft, in general by operating a thruster in synchronous or asynchronous direction to its spin to adjust its spin rate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/s.html#slewing|title=Dictionary of Technical Terms for Space|publisher=NASA's Software, Robotics and Simulation Division|accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl]  This results in a precession and slews for this kind of spacecraft are therefore also called "precession manoeuvre."
The slew of 3-axis stabilized spacecraft is typically in closed loop control with thrusters or electrically-powered reaction wheels maintaining or altering the craft's attitude based on sensor measurements.  A typical example is a space telescope that should be turned to observe a new celestial object. But also for 3-axis stabilized spacecraft for which the normal attitude is not inertially fixed the spacecraft is said to make a slew if the attitude is changed in another way and with another, mostly higher, rate then when in the basic attitude control mode. An example is the Magellan probe that once per orbit interrupted the scanning of the Venus surface making a large turn to direct its high gain antenna to the Earth for data transmission.

[tpl]nihongo|Metroid|メトロイド|Metoroido|lead=yes[/tpl] is an action-adventure video game, and the first entry in the Metroid series. It was co-developed by Nintendo's Research and Development 1 division and Intelligent Systems, and was released for the Famicom Disk System in Japan on August 6, 1986, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in August 1987, and in Europe in January 1988. The game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in October 2004, and for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe in July 2007, in North America in August 2007, and in Japan in March 2008. Metroid was produced by Gunpei Yokoi, directed by Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto, and had music composed by Hirokazu Tanaka.
Set on the planet Zebes, the story follows Samus Aran as she attempts to retrieve the parasitic Metroid organisms that were stolen by Space Pirates, who plan to replicate the Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then use them as biological weapons to destroy Samus and all who oppose them. The game's style, focusing on exploration and the search for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas, influenced other video games. Its varied endings for fast completion times made it a popular game for speedrunning. Metroid was lauded for being one of the first video games to feature a female protagonist, though the player must complete the game in under five hours for this to be revealed, with the game's instruction manual even using "he" to refer to the protagonist. Nintendo Power ranked Metroid 11th on their list of the best video games made on a Nintendo video game console. On Top 100 Games lists, Metroid was ranked 7th by Game Informer and 69th by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

[tpl]MedalCountry|[tpl]ENG[/tpl][/tpl]
Thomas "Tommy" Pardoe (April 14, 1911 – December 7, 1992) was an English boxer who competed for Great Britain in the 1932 Summer Olympics.
He was born in Birmingham.
In 1932 he finished fourth in the flyweight class after losing the bronze medal bout to Louis Salica.
At the 1930 Empire Games he won the silver medal in the flyweight class after losing the final to Jacob Smith.
Tommy Pardoe was born on April 14, 1911 and lived at 8 Church Walk, Ward End Birmingham, one of fifteen children.
He became Amateur Flyweight Champion of Great Brittan (ABAE) on 20 March 1929, also winning the title on a further five occasions. He fought in the 1932 summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles and was ranked forth, however his was awarded a Bronze medal.
In boxing, if one of the semi-final losers is knocked out, he can't box again for a certain time period as a safety precaution, and it wouldn’t be fair to take away his chance at a bronze medal just because his semi-final opponent was so much better than the others, in all other cases the losing semi-finalists both get a bronze in Olympics and other games because, there are no qualifying events before the main events.
Pardoe competed for England and finished second in the 1930 British Empire Games Flyweight class after losing the final to Jacob Smith.
He turned professional and on 11 December 1933 won his first fight with Bert Kirby, whom he again defeated on 12 March 1934 in the British (Southern Area) Flyweight Title. On 11 June 1934, he beat Joe Mendiola and then fought Benny Lynch 15 April 1935.
He put up a tremendous fight against Lynch in an eliminator for British Flyweight title, winning five of the last six rounds, but bearing in mind Lynch’s superior experience (82 professional fights), he was knocked out in the fourteenth round. This fight seemed to spell the end of Pardoe’s professional career; he had a further seven fights, but did not win another professional fight.
He died 7 December 1992.

Fried chicken (also referred to as Southern fried chicken) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.

Sir  Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE, FRAS  (Sri Lankabhimanya Arthur Charles Clarke) (16 December 1917 – 19 March 2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/725/000023656/ | title=Arthur C.

For many years he, along with Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov, were known as the "Big Three" of science fiction.[tpl]cite news |author=Lech Mintowt-Czyz and Steve Bird |title=Science fiction author Arthur C Clarke dies aged 90 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3579120.ece |quote=Science fiction writer Sir Arthur C Clarke has died aged 90 in his adopted home of Sri Lanka, it was confirmed tonight. |work=The Times |location=London |date=19 March 2008 |accessdate=19 March 2008 [/tpl]
Clarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934 while still a teenager, he joined the British Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system—an idea that, in 1963, won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal.The 1945 Proposal by Arthur C.

Clarke was also a science writer, who was both an avid populariser of space travel and a futurist of uncanny ability, who won a Kalinga Prize (award given by UNESCO for popularising science) in 1961. These all together eventually earned him the moniker "prophet of the space age".Reddy, John. "Arthur Clarke: Prophet of the Space Age" Reader's Digest 90.564 (April 1969).
Clarke emigrated to Sri Lanka in 1956, largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.natureseychelles.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=326&Itemid=106 | title = Remembering Arthur C.

Clarke augmented his fame later on in the 1980s, by being the host of several television shows such as Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World.

[[Gerhard Werner]]
CATEGORIES: Pharmacologists, University of Texas at Austin faculty, University of Vienna alumni, 1921 births, 2012 deaths

Gerhard Werner (1921–2012) was a medical doctor and scholar active in research covering areas of pharmacology, psychiatry, cognitive neuroscience, especially neurodynamics, artificial intelligence, and complexity theory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bme.utexas.edu/news/466-adjunct-professor-gerhard-werner-dies |title=Adjunct Professor Gerhard Werner Dies |publisher=Bme.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl]  During his career, and continuing after his retirement in 1989, he published just over a hundred scientific papers and held administrative posts in government, academic and corporate institutions.
Werner graduated from the University of Vienna Medical School in 1945, and continued studies in mathematics, theoretical physics, and later Psychoanalysis.  He joined the World Health Organization (WHO) and served in Calcutta, India and Sao Paulo, Brazil.  He worked at Cornell Medical College and Johns Hopkins University with Vernon Mountcastle.  He was instrumental in introducing the neuropharmacological use of Succinylcholine.  Werner became Chairman of the Pharmacology Department, and later Dean of the Medical School, at the University of Pittsburgh.
In 1984, Werner was awarded the "Alexander von Humboldt Price" to study temporal signal correlations in the brain in a collaboration with Heribert Reitboeck at Philipps University of Marburg / Germany.  
Werner, also, served in the Veterans Administration (VA) in Pittsburgh, and later was a consultant to Motorola. 
As a member of National Institute of Health (NIH), he was involved in the early development of the prototype for the personal computer during the LINC project.  At the University of Pittsburgh, he helped develop an early AI-driven medical expert system - the PROPHET system.  He has a long-standing interest in the theoretical grounding of brain-related dynamical systems.
After encountering the constructivist concepts of Humberto Maturana, Werner moved away from representationalism as a way to explain the nature of how brain and mind enable knowledge of reality. Like Walter Freeman and the late Francisco Varela, Werner espoused dynamical systems theory in place of representationalism.
Vision neuroscientist J. Anthony Movshon of New York University credited Werner and
Vernon Mountcastle for introducing Alan Turing's statistical approach to making decisions into neuroscience in the 1960s.
Dr. Werner was an Adjunct Professor with the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. 
Dr. Werner died on March 26, 2012 at the age of 90.
 
 The origin and current use of the concepts of computation, representation and information in Neuroscience are examined and conceptual flaws are identified which vitiate their usefulness for addressing the problem of the neural basis of Cognition and Consciousness. In contrast, a convergence of views is presented to support the characterization of the Nervous System as a complex dynamical system operating in a metastable regime, and capable of evolving to configurations and transitions in phase space with potential relevance for Cognition and Consciousness.
-Perspectives on the Neuroscience of Cognition and Consciousness,
Pages 82-95, BioSystems 87, 2007

After a career in medicine and brain science that lasted nearly 70 years,  Werner's final solo paper "From brain states to mental phenomena via phase space transitions and renormalization group transformation: proposal of a theory" was published in 2012 in the journal Cognitive Neurodynamics. In 2013, Werner and BJ Mitterauer published an article entitled "Neuromodulatory Systems" in the journal Frontiers in Neural Circuits.

[[Golden Shears]]

CATEGORIES: Masterton, Sheep wool, Sports competitions in New Zealand, Sport in the Wellington Region, Agriculture in New Zealand, Recurring sporting events established in 1961

The Golden Shears International Shearing and Woolhandling Championships is the World's most prestigious sheep shearing event.
It was founded in Masterton, New Zealand, and has been held in the town's War Memorial Stadium each March since 1961.
It initially comprised competition in three shearing classes, including the Open championship, which is the most revered of all single shearing titles worldwide. In the final, sometimes referred to as shearing's equivalent of the Wimbledon Open in tennis, six shearers each shear 20 second-shear sheep, for which the fastest time was 15min 27.4sec, shorn in 2003. 
But the competition is about more than just the fastest time, and the winner is decided on time and quality penalty points, the winner being thet shearer with the lowest score.
Other events have expanded the programme over the years, with competition now held in five shearing classes, four woolhandling classes and three woolpressing classes, along with other events.
The McSkimming Memorial Triple Crown final was added to the programme in 1973, and in various sponsorship guises has become the unofficial New Zealand multiwools national championship. Currently known as the PGG Wrightson National Circuit, it is shorn in five qualifying stages in which points are accrued for shearing finewooled merino sheep, fullwooled strongool sheep, coarse-wooled Corriedales, lambs and second-shear sheep. In the final, six competitors shear three of each type.
The Golden Shears in Masterton spawned Golden Shears championships in other countries, including the United Kingdom, where a Golden Shears of Great Britain was held at the Royal Bath and West Show, and Australia, which became involved in an annual home-and-away transtasman test series, staged alternately at Masterton, and at Euroa, Vic. Suspended for some years after industrial disturbances in Australia, the Australian legs of the series are now held at differing venues in conjunction with the Australisan national championships.
While machine shearing contests have been held at least since 1902, when an event was held at the Hawke's Bay A and P Show, Hastings, New Zealand, the Golden Shears is credited with the spread of shearing as a world-wide sport, including a Golden Shears World Championships, held first in England in 1977.
Despite the advent of a World Championships every 2–4 years, the Golden Shears in Masterton every year remains the mecca for sheep shearers worldwide, and entries in all classes have in peak years exceeded 600.

Genetic studies support the endosymbiotic theory that a subset of these organisms evolved to live inside mammalian cells as mitochondria to provide cellular energy to the cells in return for protection and sustenance.  ATP production in the rickettsia is biochemically identical to that in mammalian mitochondria.
Human monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by E. chaffeensis is known to spread through tick infection primarily in the southern, southcentral and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.Barker, R. W.

The Mark 27 torpedo was the first of the United States Navy 19-inch (48-cm) submarine-launched torpedoes.Kurak, September 1966, p.145  This electrically-propelled torpedo was 125 inches (3.175 m) long and weighed 1174 pounds (534 kg). The torpedo employed a passive acoustic guidance system and was intended for both submarine and surface targets.  Nicknamed "Cutie" http://www.maritime.org/wish-mk27.htm by submarine crews, the Mark 27 entered service in 1943.  The torpedo was classified as obsolete in the 1960s.
The Mark 27 was essentially a Mark 24 mine which had been modified for submarine launching in a 21-inch submerged torpedo tube by the addition of wood guides mounted on the torpedo's outer shell.

"The Last Farewell" is a song from 1971 by the British-Kenyan folk singer Roger Whittaker. Whittaker hosted a radio programme in Great Britain in 1971, backed by a full orchestra with arrangements by Zack Lawrence. Whittaker is quoted as saying that "one of the ideas I had was to invite listeners to send their poems or lyrics to me and I would make songs out of them. We got a million replies, and I did one each week for 26 weeks."Hyatt, Wesley (1999). The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits (Billboard Publications) Ron A. Webster, a silversmith from Birmingham, England, sent Whittaker his poem titled "The Last Farewell", and this became one of the selections to appear on the radio programme. It was subsequently recorded and featured on Whittaker's 1971 album New World in the Morning (A Special Kind of Man in the US and Canada). Although the song failed to reach the music charts then, it's one of the fewer than forty all-time singles to have sold 10 million (or more) physical copies worldwide.

[[Democratic journalism]]
CATEGORIES: Citizen journalism, Citizen media, Journalism genres

Democratic journalism is a term describing a relatively new phenomenon where news stories are ranked by a vote among the stories' readers.Baase, Sara. A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet. 3. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2007. Page 351. ISBN 0-13-600848-8. This phenomenon has been brought about largely due to the creation of social networking sites such as Digg and Newsvine.
The effect of democratic journalism is that it promotes news based on the popular opinion of the majority, or the "wisdom of the crowd". This differs from more traditional approaches, such as the one commonly used in the newspaper industry, where an editor would decide whether to print a particular news story. 
Some authors look at democratic journalism as taking in rights to free speech, assembly, human rights, the rule of law  and other mechanisms to check abuses. It also takes in civic conscionsness and social solidarity. Journalism then has a clear link with democracy, and is shaped accordingly. This would also have different meanings in First, Second and Third World nations. The democratic role of journalism should transcend excessive commercialism, sensationalism, and manipulation by media elites.[ref]Grave New World? Democratic Journalism Enters the Global Twenty-first Century

"The Pied Piper" is a pop song written by the duo of Steve Duboff and Artie Kornfeld, who first recorded the song in 1965 as The Changin' Times.  However, it was British pop singer Crispian St. Peters, who scored a major hit with the song during the summer of 1966, when his single went to #4 in the United States, #5 in the United Kingdom and #1 in Canada.Songs from the Year 1966Library and Archives Canada. RPM 100 Week of July 18, 1966 Retrieved March 13, 2012.
In the Netherlands, the beatgroup The Jets from Utrecht recorded their version a few months before St. Peters did.  Rumors had it that this version inspired the Crispian St. Peters version.
The song's title came from The Pied Piper of Hamelin.  In Italy, there was well-known a cover version, with the title "Bandiera gialla" ("Yellow flag"), sung by local artist Gianni Pettenati and theme of a popular radio program of that era targeted to the young people,L'almanacco di Radioscrigno Retrieved March 13, 2012. but there was also a version, sung in English, by Patty Pravo.  The song is noted for its use of the Penny Whistle to represent the pipes of the Pied Piper.
Del Shannon also did a cover of the song in the 60s and The Ventures released a version in 1966.  In 1966 in France, Pop sensation Sheila did a French cover of it with "Le pipeau".Jamaican reggae duo Bob and Marcia had a Top 20 hit with their version, taking the song to UK #11 in July 1971.
In 1967 Artie Kornfeld put together a studio band called the Bassetts consisting of Hugh McCracken, Steve Gadd, Tony Levin, and Tony Amato (formerly of the Chaperones) and they put out a 45 in that same year with "The Pied Piper" on the A side and "With a Little Love" on the B side.
Rita Marley, Bob Marley's wife, did a ska cover of the song in 1966.
In 1999, the song was used in an advertisement for the first-generation Toyota Echo in New Zealand.

West Credit Secondary School is a high school in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. It is a workplace destination for the Peel District School Board. Its cousin school, North Peel Secondary School is a high school in Brampton, Ontario, Canada that offers a similarity in trades courses. West Credit and North Peel are currently the only two vocational schools in the Peel District School Board that offer students more choices in trades courses than most other regular high schools. It is aimed for students who want to pursue a career in the trades, or sometimes it is recommended for those with learning developmental disabilities such as Attention-Deficit Disorder and other learning problems that are influenced in the students. The 'special' kind students are thought to learn more visually, and by learning more with hands-on training. Both high schools offer applied and academic courses that are usually more simple and easier to learn than most regular high schools. Students can right away earn apprenticeships and start working right away in their respected workplace destinations upon completing and graduating to earn their high school diplomas. 
West Credit School has been criticized for lack of action by school administrators with regard to bullying incidents. A Grade 10 student, Lindsay Hyde, was forced to transfer to another school after her bullying ordeal was reported on torontosun.com and canoe.ca."I am going through Hell", retrieved 27 February 2008

Thomas "Tom" Burke (born 1862 in Wrexham; died 1914) was a Welsh international footballer who played for Wrexham and Newton Heath, who would go on to become Manchester United. Burke won a total of eight caps for Wales, playing at half-back.
Burke began his career with Wrexham Grosvenor, but moved on to Wrexham and Wrexham Olympic before making a transfer to Liverpool Cambrians. From there, he was signed by Newton Heath in 1886. The club's parent company, the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Company, was able to employ Burke as a painter – as was his trade – at the nearby Carriage and Wagon Works, from which the club had been born. In his first season at Newton Heath, Burke played mostly at left-half, but switched to right-half by the following season, and even played at centre-half or inside-right on occasion.
When Burke's time at Newton Heath came to an end, after making 29 appearances for the Heathens, he moved back to Wrexham to play for Wrexham Victoria.

[[County of Stolberg]]
CATEGORIES: 1548 disestablishments, States and territories established in 1210, History of Saxony-Anhalt, Harz

The County of Stolberg ([tpl]lang-de|Grafschaft Stolberg[/tpl]) was a county of the Holy Roman Empire located in the Harz mountain range in present-day Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It was ruled by a branch of the House of Stolberg.
The town of Stolberg was probably founded in the 12th century as a mining settlement. The Counts of Stolberg (Grafen zu Stolberg) probably derived from a branch of the counts of Hohnstein castle near Nordhausen in Thuringia. The castle of Stolberg was first mentioned in 1210 as Stalberg, then the seat of one count Henry originally from nearby Voigtstedt. It remained a property of the comital family until its expropriation in 1945.
The Stolberg lands, which were located mostly east of the Harz, included Stolberg, Hayn, the lower County of Hohnstein (1417), as well as Kelbra and Heringen (1413/17), the two latter territories being ruled alongside the House of Schwarzburg.
The Counts of Stolberg could significantly enlarge their territory when they inherited the County of Wernigerode in 1429, the County of Königstein in 1535, and the County of Rochefort in 1544. The Protestant Reformation was introduced into their territory in 1539. On 19 March 1548 the line was split between a Harz line (Stolberg-Stolberg) and a Rhenish line with the possessions in Rochefort (Stolberg-Rochefort) and Königstein im Taunus (Stolberg-Königstein).

[[Harold Newton]]

CATEGORIES: 1934 births, 1994 deaths, Artists from Florida

Harold Newton (1934-1994) was a central and founding member of the loose-knit group of African American artists known as the Florida Highwaymen.  Although Newton and the other Highwaymen were not part of an organized school, all were influenced by the work of Florida landscape artist A.E. Backus and shared a commitment to capturing Florida’s scenic beauty in a quick, formulaic style.  Despite his lack of formal training, Newton had an exceptional ability to capture the subtlety and variety of Florida’s coastlines and wetlands, an ability that distances him from other, central figures in the group such as Alfred Hair. Indeed, Newton is generally regarded as the most talented of the HighwaymenBeaty, 2005, p. 42 and in recent years his work has been coveted by serious art collectors and Highwaymen enthusiasts both regionally and nationally. His oil paintings, once sold door-to-door for very modest sums, now can fetch in the tens of thousands, depending on the scene, composition, and quality.  
Gary Monroe, author of the book Harold Newton, The Original Highwayman,  captures Newton’s place in the Highwaymen movement and Florida history in the following remark: 
 
 Harold Newton stands alone, having created the images of modern Florida that symbolized the state as the place to really be alive, to raise a family in its fecund wilds, and to find solace as one looks back at life in retirement. Florida was the Promised Land. The artist possessed an unmatched ability to define the state’s meaning and natural beauty in iconic dimensions. This is his legacy.Monroe, 2007, p. 7
 
Arguably, much of the appeal of Newton’s work (as well as the other artists in his ilk) stems from the unlikely success of a black artist in a time of racial segregation and disenfranchisement. Newton was undeterred, and, pursuing his love for his art, secured a considerable following among the more privileged and affluent members of the Florida communities through which he traveled.  Newton was an outsider to the more pervasive depictions of American life in the 1950s and 1960s, but it is this fact that inspires a more enlightened America to look back on his work with admiration and respect. Somewhat ironically, Newton’s life and works represents– from the vantage point of the opening decade of the 21st Century – the very best of a nation that honors the fortitude and independence of its citizens. 
Harold Newton died in 1994, a year after suffering a debilitating stroke. He was 59 years old.

The 2008 congressional elections in Idaho were held on November 4, 2008 to determine who would represent the state of Idaho in the United States House of Representatives, coinciding with the presidential and senatorial elections. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; those elected will serve in the 111th Congress from January 3, 2009 until January 3, 2011.
Idaho has two seats in the House, apportioned according to the 2000 United States Census. Representatives are elected for two-year terms. Its 2007-2008 congressional delegation consisted of two Republicans.

The Mark 16 torpedo was a redesign of the United States Navy standard Mark 14 torpedo to incorporate war-tested improvements for use in unmodified United States fleet submarines.  The torpedo was considered the United States standard anti-shipping torpedo for twenty years;Kurak, September 1966, p.144 although significant numbers of Mark 14 wartime production remained in inventory.  This hydrogen peroxide propelled, 21 inch (53 cm) torpedo was 246 inches (6.25 m) long and weighed 2 tons (1800 kg). The Mod 0 warhead contained 1260 lb (572 kg) of TPX explosive and was the most powerful conventional submarine torpedo warhead ever used by any Navy. The United States used TPX explosive which was about 75 % more powerful (7405 J/g.) than the Type 97 explosive in the larger Japanese Type 93 Mod 3. (780 kg of Type 97, 4370 J/g.) The Mod 1 warhead contained 960 lb (435 kg) of TPX or HBX (7552 J/g.) explosive. The torpedo could be set for straight- or pattern-running.

CATEGORIES: 1989 singles, Howard Jones (musician) songs, Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles, Songs written by Howard Jones (musician), 1989 songs, Warner Music Group singles, Elektra Records singles

"Everlasting Love" is the title of a popular song originally written and recorded by the British singer-songwriter Howard Jones.
Released as the first single from Jones' 1989 album Cross That Line, "Everlasting Love" reached #12 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the late spring of that year, and also peaked at #19 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the first of only two singles to appear there. It also spent two weeks at #1 on the US adult contemporary chart, the singer's second chart-topper on this tally (following "No One Is to Blame" from 1986). In his native UK, where Jones had enjoyed numerous pop hits, "Everlasting Love" failed to have as much of an impact as earlier singles, and it stalled at #62 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was co-produced by ex-Tears for Fears band member Ian Stanley.
This was the first of Howard Jones' singles to be released on CD.

[[History of the National Hockey League (1967–1992)]]
CATEGORIES: History of ice hockey, National Hockey League history

The expansion era of the National Hockey League (NHL) began when six new teams were added for the 1967–68 season, ending the Original Six era. The six existing teams were grouped into the newly created East Division, and the expansion teams—the Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues—formed the West Division.
The NHL added another six teams by 1974 to bring the league to 18 teams. This continued expansion was partially brought about by the creation of the World Hockey Association (WHA), which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players. Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. When the WHA ceased operations in 1979, the NHL absorbed four of the league's teams—the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets. This brought the NHL to 21 teams (the Cleveland Barons had ceased operations in 1978), a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks joined as an expansion franchise in 1991.
The NHL became involved in international play, starting with the Summit Series in 1972, which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players of the Soviet Union. Canada won the eight-game series four wins to three with one tie. The success of the series led to the creation of the Canada Cup, held five times between 1976 and 1991. NHL teams also faced Soviet League teams that toured North America between 1975 and 1991 in what was known as the Super Series. The fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 saw many former Soviet-Bloc players stream into the NHL, joining several players who had defected in the 1980s.
This was one of the highest scoring periods in NHL history. It was led in the 1980s by the Edmonton Oilers and Wayne Gretzky, who scored 200 points or more four times, including a current league-record 215 in 1985–86. Gretzky's 92 goals in 1981–82 also remains a league record. No other player in NHL history has scored 200 points, although Mario Lemieux came close in 1988–89 with 199.

Gollum is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He was introduced in the 1937  children's fantasy novel The Hobbit, and became an important supporting character in its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit[tpl]ME-ref|UT|Part Three, IV. "The Hunt for the Ring", p 353, note 9[/tpl].

In the Appendix F to The Lord of the Rings, the name Sméagol is said to be a "translation" of the actual Middle-earth name Trahald (having to do with the idea of "burrowing", and rendered with a name based on Old English smygel of similar meaning).See definition: [tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bosworthtoller.com/028184 |title=smygel|work=An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary (Online) | author=Bosworth, Joseph | authorlink=Joseph Bosworth | coauthors=Toller, T.

The Ring, which Gollum referred to as "my precious" or "precious", extended his life far beyond natural limits. Under centuries of the Ring's influence, Gollum had "come to love and despise the Ring, just as he loved and hated himself." Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it. Bilbo Baggins found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life.

Guy-Crescent Fagon (May 11, 1638 – March 11, 1718) was a physician and botanist. He came from nobility and his great uncle, Guy de La Brosse, had founded the Royal Gardens. Fagon was director of the gardens too.Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Volume 23 by Johns Hopkins Hospital, pg 374 His significance in botany is reflected in the genus Fagonia being named after him. He also acted as the physician of Louis XIV of France.Jepson Manual Treatment In 1669 he was made an honorary member of the French Academy of Sciences. He wrote about the health of the royal family.Remarques sur la santé du roy: Journal de santé de Louis XIV : précédé de la lancette et le sceptre par Stanis Perez / écrit par Vallot, Daquin et Fagon ; édition établie par Stanis Perez ; précédé de La lancette et le sceptre par Stanis Perez.Grenoble : Millon, c2004. ISBN 978-2-84137-159-4 He lost his position as head physician after Louis XIV's death, which was somewhat customary after a king died, but he also received criticism for how he had dealt with the King's final illness. People thought his methods were proposterous, that he bled his patients to death. He was thought to have killed Young Duc de Bretagne and the beloved Marie Adelaide.Science and polity in France: the end of the old regime by Charles Coulston Gillispie, pg 205 Despite this he remained in charge of the Royal Garden until his death in 1718.Buffon: a life in natural history by Jacques Roger and Leslie Pearce Williams, pgs 49-50

[[Osmosis]]
CATEGORIES: Diffusion, Water technology, Membrane technology

Osmosis is the spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a partially permeable membrane into a region of higher solute concentration, in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides.[tpl]OED|Osmosis[/tpl]Osmosis, Encyclopædia Britannica on-line[tpl]Cite book |last=Haynie |first=Donald T. |title=Biological Thermodynamics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2001 |pages=130–136 |isbn=0-521-79549-4 [/tpl] It may also be used to describe a physical process in which any solvent moves across a semipermeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations.[tpl]cite book |last=Waugh |first=A. |coauthors=Grant, A. |title=Anatomy and Physiology in Health and Illness |publisher=Elsevier |year=2007 |location=Edinburgh |pages=25–26 |isbn=0-443-10101-9[/tpl]Osmosis.

The osmotic pressure is defined to be the pressure required to maintain an equilibrium, with no net movement of solvent. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity.
Osmosis is a vital process in biological systems, as biological membranes are semipermeable. In general, these membranes are impermeable to large and polar molecules, such as ions, proteins, and polysaccharides, while being permeable to non-polar and/or hydrophobic molecules like lipids as well as to small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and nitric oxide. Permeability depends on solubility, charge, or chemistry, as well as solute size. Water molecules travel through the plasma membrane, tonoplast membrane (vacuole) or protoplast by diffusing across the phospholipid bilayer via aquaporins (small transmembrane proteins similar to those responsible for facilitated diffusion and ion channels). Osmosis provides the primary means by which water is transported into and out of cells. The turgor pressure of a cell is largely maintained by osmosis across the cell membrane between the cell interior and its relatively hypotonic environment.
Jean-Antoine Nollet first documented observation of osmosis in 1748.L’Abbé Nollet (June 1748) “Recherches sur les causes du bouillonnement des liquides” (Researches on the causes of the boiling of liquids) Mémoires de Mathématique et de Physique, tirés des registres de l’Académie Royale des Sciences de l’année 1748, pp. 57–104; especially pp. 101–103. The Mémoires (1748) were printed in: Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences Année 1748, which was published in 1752 and which contains a condensed version of Nollet's article on pages 10–19.  Original text :  Avant que de finir ce Mémoire, je crois devoir rendre compte d'un fait que je dois au hasard, & qui me parut d'abord … singulier … j'en avois rempli une fiole cylindrique, longue de cinq pouces, & d'un pouce de diamètre ou environ ; & l'ayant couverte d'un morceau de vessie mouillée & ficelée au col du vaisseau, je l'avois plongée dans un grand vase plein d'eau, afin d'être sûr qu'il ne rentrât aucun air dans l'esprit de vin. Au bout de cinq ou six heures, je fus tout surpris de voir que la fiole étoit plus pleine qu'au moment de son immersion, quoiqu'elle le fût alors autant que ses bords pouvoient le permettre ; la vessie qui lui servoit de bouchon, étoit devenue convexe & si tendue, qu’en la piquant avec une épingle, il en sortit un jet de liqueur qui s'éleva à plus d'un pied de hauteur.   Translation :  Before finishing this memoir, I think I should report an event that I owe to chance and which at first seemed to me … strange … I filled alcohol a cylindrical vial, five inches long and about one inch in diameter; and after having covered it with piece of damp bladder was tied to the neck of the vial, I immersed it in a large bowl full of water, in order to be sure that no air re-entered the alcohol. At the end of 5 or 6 hours, I was very surprised to see that the vial was fuller than at the moment of its immersion, although it been filled as far as its sides would allow ; the bladder that served as its cap, bulged and had become so stretched that on pricking it with a needle, there came from it a jet of alcohol that rose more than a foot high.  The word "osmosis" descends from the words "endosmose" and "exosmose", which were coined by French physician René Joachim Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847) from the Greek words ένδον (endon : within), έξο (exo : outside), and ωσμος (osmos : push, impulsion).[ref]Etymology of "osmosis" :

CATEGORIES: Symptoms and signs: Respiratory system, Onomatopoeias

A hiccup  ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɪ|k|ə|p[/tpl] [tpl]respell|HIK|əp[/tpl]; also spelled hiccough) is an involuntary contraction (myoclonic jerk) of the diaphragm that may repeat several times per minute. In medicine, it is known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF), or singultus, Latin for the act of catching one's breath while sobbing.[tpl]cite web| url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/775746-overview | title = Hiccups | last = Wilkes | first = Garry | date = 2 August 2007 | work = eMedicine | publisher = Medscape | accessdate = 22 April 2009 [/tpl] The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc. Once triggered, the reflex causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm followed about 0.25 seconds later by closure of the vocal cords, which results in the classic "hic" sound. At the same time, the normal peristalsis of the esophagus is suppressed. [tpl]Citation needed|reason=Where can readers read about the suppression of peristalsis? date=November 2013|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Hiccups may occur individually, or they may occur in bouts. The rhythm of the hiccup, or the time between hiccups, tends to be relatively constant.
A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies are often used to attempt to shorten the duration.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.home-remedies-for-you.com/remedy/Hiccups.html | title =Hiccups | accessdate=5 November 2011 | publisher = Home Remedies [/tpl] Medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups.

The Battle of the Brothers is an American college football rivalry between the Utah Utes football team of the University of Utah and Utah State Aggies football team of Utah State University.
left|thumb|125px|An article from the Salt Lake Tribune reporting on the inaugural game The most notable feature of this rivalry is that Utah and Utah State have not competed in the same conference since 1961, meaning each meeting since then has been a voluntary non-conference game.
For much of its history, whenever the two teams played in Salt Lake City, it was held on Thanksgiving Day. However, this aspect of the rivalry ended in 1958. Since 1959, no meeting has been played on Thanksgiving Day; and more recently, the meeting has been held in September as one of the first games of the season for both teams.
In the 1970s, the University of Utah and its fans turned their sights towards Brigham Young University as their biggest rival, and the Holy War became the main rivalry in the state of Utah. But while Utah leads their series against Utah State 78–29–4,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/utah/opponents_records.php?teamid=3351|title=Utah vs Utah St.|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=2009-08-15[/tpl] this rivalry is expected to remain a staple of each teams' annual non-conference schedule.

Bosniaks are typically characterized by their historic tie to the Bosnian historical region, traditional majority adherence to Islam since the 15th and 16th centuries, common culture and Bosnian language. In the English-speaking world, Bosniaks are also frequently referred to as Bosnian MuslimsThis term is considered inaccurate since not all Bosniaks profess themselves to Islam or practice the religion. Partly because of this, since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Bosniak has replaced Muslim as an official ethnic term in part to avoid confusion with the religious term Muslim – an adherent of Islam.

CATEGORIES: Melons

The Sprite melon is a kind of melon, similar to honeydew, which originates from Japan. Since the late 1990s, it has been cultivated in North Carolina as a specialty crop and has increased in popularity in recent years.[ref]
</ref> 
A sprite melon has a round shape and is typically about the size of a grapefruit. It generally ranges in weight from 1.0 to 1.5 lbs. The flesh of a sprite melon is ivory in color and firm, while the peel ranges from ivory (unripe) to yellowish (ripe). As the melon reaches optimal ripeness, horizontal brown markings will appear near the stem. Sprite melon contains seeds. The firm, juicy, sweet flesh of the sprite melon is usually eaten for dessert and tends to resemble the flavor of both pears and honeydew, however it is much sweeter than either of these and can often consist of 18% sugar (25% to 30% more than other melons).[ref]

Moses Bruine Cotsworth (Willitoft, Yorks 3 December 1859 - Vancouver 4 June 1943) was a calendar reformer.
He started his career in a variety of companies where his analytical skills were valuable.  Based on his work at the North Eastern Railway Company, he published a book on railway rates. In 1907, he was chosen to chair a commission to reorganize the British Columbia civil service.
His interest in calendar reform began when he was working at a railroad company, and found that monthly accounting was greatly complicated by the fact that months did not divide evenly into weeks.
He devised what is now known as the International Fixed Calendar. In 1922, he founded the International Fixed Calendar League.
He was a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants[tpl]dn|date=January 2013[/tpl], of the Royal Statistical Society, and of the Geological Society.

The emotion her singing elicits is summarized by a beautiful quote from Nobel Prize-winning Portuguese author Jose Saramago:
"The first time I heard Tania Libertad sing, it was a revelation from on high - from a place where only a naked voice might go, alone in the world, unaccompanied by any instrument. Tania was singing the Rafael Alberti composition "La Paloma" a capella, and each note touched a string in my soul until I was completely dazzled." - José Saramago http://peruanista.blogspot.com/2008/10/tania-libertad-live-in-washington-dc.html#sthash.msmZ3Duj.dpuf

The case was an appeal of an Internal Revenue Service denial of the plaintiffs' claim of $106,058,228 in capital losses during the 1997 tax year, and associated penalties. After a bench trial, Judge Janet Bond Arterton ruled on August 27, 2004 that the transactions employed by Long-Term Capital Holdings did not have economic substance, and were disregarded for tax purposes.

The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of [tpl]convert|40|to|70|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and a body weight of [tpl]convert|3.5|to|9|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates against cold weather. Two of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask, which are themes in the mythology of several Native American tribes. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years.Hohmann, pp. 71–72 The diet of the omnivorous raccoon, which is usually nocturnal, consists of about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant foods, and 27% vertebrates.
The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them to be pests. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across the European mainland, the Caucasus region and Japan.
Though previously thought to be solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender-specific social behavior. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and other potential invaders. Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares (7 acres) for females in cities to 50 km2 (20 sq mi) for males in prairies. After a gestation period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as "kits", are born in spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersion in late fall. Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years. In many areas, hunting and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death.

Keannekeuk (c. 1790–1852), also known as the "Kickapoo Prophet", was a Kickapoo medicine man and spiritual leader of the Vermilion band of the Kickapoo nation. He lived in East Central Illinois much of his life along the Vermilion RiverHerring, Joseph B., Kenekuk: The Kickapoo Prophet. University of Kansas Press, 1988, pp. 47–48. and led a community of followers, whose beliefs centered on non-violence, passive resistance to resettlement, abstinence from alcohol, and meditation.Student Britannica He favored moderate, nonviolent accommodation and coexistence with American westward expansion, and a settled agricultural life. These views caused him and his followers to suffer derision and alienation from some of the other Kickapoo bands. His tribal community's religious outlook embodied a type of Christian evangelism in some respects and a group of Potawatomi converts joined his following over time. He died on the reservation in Kansas in 1852.
Reverend William H. Honnell, who visited a few years after Kennekuk's death, reported that Kennekuk went back and forth between Christian teachings and "heathenism."
Some Kickapoo descendants still follow the tenets of his preaching.Kickapoos: Lords of the Middle Border pgs 109–118

The project is the first community-owned wind farm in Australia. The initiative emerged because the community felt that the state and federal governments were not doing enough to address climate change. Hepburn Wind is the first project of the Hepburn Renewable Energy Association, now known as SHARE. 
Hepburn Wind Project formally launched their share offer on 25 July 2008, and as of June 2011 over 1700 members had subscribed a total of $9.0 million. The project has secured over $13.1 million in funding with the additional funds being bank debt and Government grants.Hepburn Wind Places Order for TurbinesGreen Light for Hepburn Wind Shares have been issued with priority to the local residents of Daylesford and Hepburn Springs.
As the project is under 30 MW, it was assessed under the local planning guidelines administered through the Hepburn Shire Council. The planning permit was issued by Hepburn Shire in February 2007.Hepburn Wind FAQs The council received 325 submissions in support of the proposal and 18 objections.Council votes yes on Leonards Hill wind farm, The Advocate, 27 Feb, 2007
The permit was subsequently challenged unsuccessfully at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) in June 2007.Perry v Hepburn SC 2007 VCAT 1309 (27 July 2007)
On 28 April 2010 the project signed a contract with REpower Systems for the turnkey construction of the wind farm. The official ground breaking ceremony was held on 8 October 2010 and was officiated by the Hon Gavin Jennings, the Victorian Minister for the Environment at the time.
Construction began in November 2010. The turbines left Germany on 5 December 2010 on the SE Panthea and arrived in Melbourne on 22 February 2011. 
A community picnic day was held to view and celebrate the erection of the first turbine on Saturday, 19 April 2011.
The wind farm began generating power into the local electricity network on Wednesday, 22 June 2011.Hepburn Wind generates first power into grid
Community-owned wind farms are common in Denmark and Germany, which have high levels of wind power use. Community wind projects are also emerging in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.

[[Undubbing]]

CATEGORIES: Video game mods, Hacking (hobbyist), Video game culture

Undubbing is a type of video game hacking, which involves modifying the contents of an officially localized video game to match the audio and voice acting to its country of origin while retaining the translated text of the country in which it has been localized.  
A typical candidate for an undub is a Japanese game which has been published in the U.S. with text translated, and voice acting re-dubbed in English by the localizing publisher, but without an in-game option to change the audio back to its original language due to lack of space on the media, licensing restrictions, marketing reasons or other publishing or development concerns.  The process of undubbing consists of reverse-engineering the contents of both the localized and the original versions of the game, locating the audio resources within a ROM or an optical media image in the localized game, and replacing them with the audio data from the original version.

[[Value noise]]

CATEGORIES: Noise, Computer graphic techniques

Value noise is a type of noise commonly used as a procedural texture primitive in computer graphics. It is conceptually different, and often confused with gradient noise examples of which are the Perlin noise and Simplex noise. This method consists of a creation of a lattice of points which are assigned random values. The noise function then returns the interpolated number based on the value of the neighboring lattice points.
To improve the quality of the generated noise, multiple octaves of this noise can be generated and then summed together. This technique produces results very similar to Perlin noise at the cost of lower quality while having a simpler algorithm.David Ebert, Kent Musgrave, Darwyn Peachey, Ken Perlin, and Worley.

The Heist is a quirky crime-drama about two first-time jewel thieves who stage a bizarre diamond heist with seemingly disastrous results, written and directed by short-film director Campbell Cooley and presented in 2008.
With The Heist Campbell Cooley wanted to tell a character-driven story without dialogue and, to add to the complexity of the challenge, he also underscored the entire story to a minuet by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, writing the story to the music. Consistent with his style, the film is full of twists and surprises. The action flows in harmony with Mozart’s Minuet movement from Divertimento in D Major.
The Leith Short Film Festival in Scotland called it a "Witty & engaging crime-drama".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leithshortfilmfestival.co.uk/festival-2008.html |title=Leith Short Film Festival, Leith, Edinburgh Scotland, UK |work= |accessdate=2011-02-13[/tpl] The Panorama International Film Festival of Patras, Greece are quoted as saying: "...(the) film is very beautiful!".

[[Gradient noise]]

CATEGORIES: Noise, Computer graphic techniques

Gradient noise is a type of noise commonly used as a procedural texture primitive in computer graphics. It is conceptually different, and often confused with value noise. This method consists of a creation of a lattice of random gradients, which are then interpolated to obtain values in between the lattices. An artifact of some implementations of this noise is that the returned value at the lattice points is 0. Unlike the value noise, gradient noise has more energy in the high frequencies.
The first implementation of a gradient noise function was Perlin noise, credited to Ken Perlin, who published the description of it in 1985.

[[Hare games]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract strategy games

Hare games are two-player abstract strategy board games that were popular in medieval northern Europe up until the 19th century.  In this game, a hare is trying to get past three dogs who are trying to surround it and trap it.  The three dogs are represented by three pieces which normally start on one end of the board, and the hare is represented by one piece that usually starts in the middle of the board or is dropped on any vacant point in the beginning of the game.  
Hare games are similar to Bear games and hunt games.  One side has more pieces than the other with the larger side attempting to hem in the smaller side.  The smaller side though is usually compensated with more powers.  Where Hare games differ is that the hares can only move forward or sideways, and not backwards.  The hunters in the Bear games can move in all directions.  Furthermore, the dog in the Hare games cannot capture any of the hares, unlike the tigers, leopards, jaguars, and foxes in the hunt games which can capture their respective prey counterparts.    
There are several different Hare game boards depending upon the country of origin.  Many preferred the narrow double-ended spearhead-like boards with orthogonal and diagonal lines running through them.  There were several variations on this design.  However, one in Denmark used a round board, and another design is found in Latvia.  
Hare games are referred to by different names.  In 19th century France, a hare game that was popular among the military was called The Soldiers' Game.  The dog is sometimes referred to as a hound, and hence the alternative title to this game as Hare and hounds.  Other names are French Military Game, Game of Dwarfs, The Devil among trailors, and Trevolpa or Volpalejden .  
As the rules of the game are simple to program, there are many electronic implementations of the game. Online versions are usually written in Java. The second link below allows you to play this game.  In this computer game, the hares and hounds are reversed.  Instead, it is the hounds attempting to surround and immobilize the hare.

Albertonykus (meaning "Alberta claw") is a genus of alvarezsaurid dinosaur from Maastrichtian-age (Upper Cretaceous) rocks of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.  It is known from forelimb and hindlimb remains from multiple individuals.  All but two of the specimens come from a bonebed dominated by Albertosaurus.

The Sofia Court House ([tpl]lang-bg|Съдебна палата[/tpl], Sadebna palata) is a building in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, accommodating several courts in the city. Stylistically a simplistic yet monumental structure, it is located on 2 Vitosha Boulevard, surrounded by Alabin Street, Laveleye Street and Positano Street.
The need for a common building to house all the courts in Sofia was raised in 1926 with the foundation of the Judicial Buildings fund. Construction began in 1929 and finished in 1940. While it was the first structure in this strict monumental style in the city, it was followed by the Bulgarian National Bank in the 1930s and the Largo in the 1950s. The initial architectural plan was the work of Nikola Lazarov, later redesigned by Pencho Koychev. The Court House has a syenite plinth, a facing of white limestone and a noticeable cornice below the top floor. The four-storey building (with two additional underground floors) spreads over a ground area of 8,500 square metres and has 430 premises, of which 24 courtrooms, a library and a bank hall, totalling 48,000 square metres of used area.
The facade features five large gates and 12 columns. In its style, the Court House is eclectic, uniting several Classical themes, with a fourth floor instead of a baluster, as well as Roman and Byzantine style decorations on the doors, windows and corbels.

The Ministry of Finance of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) ([tpl]lang-ru|Министерство финансов СССР[/tpl]), formed on 15 March 1946, was one of the most important government offices in the Soviet Union. Until 1946 it was known as the People's Commissariat for Finance ([tpl]lang-ru|Народный комиссариат финансов[/tpl] – Narodnyi komissariat finansov, or "Narkomfin"). Narkomfin, at the all-Union level, was established on 6 July 1923 after the signing of the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, and was based upon the People's Commissariat for Finance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) formed in 1917. The Ministry was led by the Minister of Finance, prior to 1946 a Commissar, who was nominated by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and then confirmed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The minister was a member of the Council of Ministers.
During the Russian Civil War, and immediately afterwards, the Commissariat usually confiscated property to support government operations. Following a short period of stability after the civil war the Commissariat introduced several governmental taxes on the population. The commissariat's structure differed little from its Tsarist predecessor, the only notable difference was that the Soviet ministry was very centralised while the Tsarist's finance ministry was a very decentralised one. The Commissariat, and later the Ministry, prepared the state budget in a joint process with its republican and local branches. The Ministry's structure went through few changes due to the Soviet government's conservative approaches to change. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced several reforms during his rule which had the unintended consequence of considerably hurting the ministry's prestige.

[[Plato's number]]
CATEGORIES: Integers, Plato, Greek mathematics

Plato’s number is a number enigmatically referred to by Plato in his dialogue the Republic (8.546b). The text is notoriously difficult to understand and its corresponding translations do not allow an unambiguous interpretation. There is no real agreement either about the meaning or the value of the number. It also has been called the "geometrical number" or the "nuptial number" (the "number of the bride"). The passage in which Plato introduced the number has been discussed ever since it was written, with no consensus in the debate. As for the number's actual value, 216 is the most frequently proposed value for it, but 3,600 or 12,960,000 are also commonly considered.  
An incomplete list for more names and references see Dupuis J., Le Nombre Geometrique de Platon, Paris: Hachette, 1885 of authors who mention or discourse about includes the names of Aristotle, Proclus for antiquity; Ficino and Cardano during the Renaissance; Zeller, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Paul Tannery and Friedrich Hultsch in the 19th century and further new names are currently added.McNamee K., and Jacovides M.,  Annotations to the Speech of the Muses (Plato "Republic" 546B-C), Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, Bd. 144, (2003), pp. 31-50
Further in the Republic (9.587b) another number is mentioned, known as the "Number of the Tyrant".

Predigerkirche ("Preacher's Church") is a Protestant church in Erfurt, Germany. It is a monastic church to the Dominican friary, Predigerkloster, adjacent to the church. Predigerkirche was originally built by the Dominican Order in the 13th century, when the mystic Meister Eckhart was prior here. The church only became a Protestant church after the Reformation. The original building was modified in 1340–50, and the bell tower was built between 1447 and 1488. Around 1806 Predigerkirche was used as a POW camp, which led to damage to the interior and the equipment. Repairs were made around 1826.
The first organ of Predigerkirche was installed in 1567, built by Heinrich Compenius der Ältere. His grandson Ludwig Compenius built a new, Baroque style organ by 1650; it was the largest and most expensive organ in the city. Today, Predigerkirche uses a Schuke organ built in 1978. Organists who worked at Predigerkirche include the following:

[[Usa River (Komi Republic)]]
CATEGORIES: Rivers of the Komi Republic

Usa ([tpl]lang-ru|Уса́[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-kv|Усва, Usva[/tpl]) is a river in the northeast corner of European Russia which drains the Polar Urals southwest into the Pechora River. The Polar Urals tend to the northeast and the Usa runs parallel to them. It is in the Komi Republic of Russia and the largest tributary of the Pechora River, which it joins from the right. It is 565 km long, with a drainage basin of 93 600 km². 
The Usa has an average discharge of 1310 m³/s, but this varies from a maximum of 21 500 m³/s in June to a minimum of 43.9 m³/s in April. It freezes over in October/November, and is icebound until the spring thaw begins in May or June. Its largest tributaries are, from the left: Yelets, Lemva, Bolshoy Kochmes and Kosyu, and from the right: Vorkuta, Seyda and Kolva.
The river has its sources in the northern Ural Mountains, and it flows towards the southwest, roughly parallel to the mountain range. The main river is formed by the confluence of the Bolshaya Usa (Large Usa) and the Malaya Usa (Little Usa) some 30 km east of Vorkuta. The two tributaries are steep, with many rapids and waterfalls. After the confluence the main river is calm, with only a few rapids in its upper sections. Its banks here are high and cliff-like, but further downriver they become lower, wooded and boggy, except for a section around the settlement of Adak (Russian: Адак), where the river cuts through the Chernyshov Hills.
Below the settlement of Sivomaskinsky (Russian: Сивомаскинский) the river gets much wider, and in its lower reaches it is from 700 meters to 2 kilometers wide. It also starts forming meanders and sand islands, and it keeps this appearance all the way to its mouth. Some 30 km from its mouth lies the town of Usinsk and the river port of Parma. The Usa flows into the Pechora River at the settlement of Ust-Usa.
The river is navigable 325 km from its mouth, and there are river ports at Abez, Petrun, Makarikha, Parma and Ust-Usa. Within the Usa basin is the large Pechora coalfield, and in its lower parts, by the town of Usinsk, there are several big petroleum- and natural gas fields.
The Usa valley has been inhabited for 40,000 years, as evidenced by the archaeological site Mamontovaya Kurya (Russian: Мамонтовой Курьи, "the mammoth curve").[tpl]cite journal |last=Pavlov |first=Pavel |authorlink= |coauthors=John Inge Svendsen & Svein Indrelid |date=6 Sep 2001 |title=Human presence in the European Arctic nearly 40,000 years ago |journal=Nature |volume=413 |pages=64–67 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v413/n6851/full/413064a0.html |doi=10.1038/35092552 |pmid=11544525 |issue=6851 [/tpl]
With the Russian conquest of Siberia it became one of the main routes into Siberia. The route ran from the Pechora, which connects to other rivers in northern Russia, up the Usa, across the low Kamen Portage and down the Sob River to Ob River where there were customhouses at the Sob barrier and Obdorsk. During the short summer season this route was preferred by west-bound travellers since most of the sailing was down-river. For other Ural crossings see Verkhoturye.

[[Push moraine]]
CATEGORIES: Moraines, Glaciology

A push moraine or pushed moraine is in geomorphology a moraine (a landform formed by glacial processes) that forms when the terminus advance of a lowland glacier pushes unstratified glacial sediment into a pile or linear ridge in front of it. A push moraine is identified by its ability to push sediment upwards from its original horizontal position.  Push moraines are limited in size by the advance of a glacier front and its tendency to shear over the top of any ridge large enough to resist the movement of ice. Pushed moraines generally occur in low, flat plains at higher latitudes and were formed during the glacial stages of the Quaternary ice age. They can be up to 100 km long and several hundreds of metres in height.
Pushed moraines can be found in the North American plains, in Siberia and in Northern Europe. They were formed during cool, glacial stages, when glaciers advanced and covered large parts of North America and Eurasia. In some regions pushed moraines of more than one glacial stage can be recognised, or different generations from a single glacial phase. Since new glacial advances tend to destroy older pushed moraines, most were formed during the last (110,000 to 10,000 years ago) or second-last (238,000 to 128,000 years ago) glacial advances. Today push moraines can be found anywhere an advancing glacier is pushing sediment into a ridge at the terminus. Examples can be found in Alaska.

It now forms part of the Cité de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine, and is open daily except Tuesday. An admission fee is charged.
The collection was a re-founding in plaster of a collection opened in 1795 as the Musée des monuments français of actual monuments of French Medieval and Renaissance art, removed from churches and chateaux after the French Revolution.  This remained open until the Bourbon Restoration of 1816, and was highly influential on French taste, making the medievalism of the Troubadour style popular, and providing inspiration to its artists.

CATEGORIES: Living people, New Zealand songwriters, New Zealand musicians

Red McKelvie is a New Zealand singer-songwriter-instrumentalist and session musician who has been described as "Australasia's greatest pop guitarist".Glen Moffatt, "A Half Century on Debut - Red McKelvie", New Zealand Musician Magazine, February/March 2008
He has appeared on albums by Richard Clapton (including the Australian hit "Girls On The Avenue") and The Flying Circus in Australia and Hello Sailor, Dave Dobbyn's DD Smash, Al Hunter and Glen Moffatt in New Zealand.
McKelvie's early forays in the music scene were as lead guitarist for such Auckland, New Zealand, bands as The Chelsea Beats, The Dark Ages and The Avengers, but it was upon his arrival in Sydney, Australia, in 1967 that he became a much in-demand sideman and session player.
Sydney bands in which McKelvie featured included The Starving Wild Dogs, alongside future Blackfeather pianist Paul Wyld, and Quill before he joined The Flying Circus and greatly influenced their flirtation with country music.
Despite the first single from The Flying Circus's Prepared In Peace LP being McKelvie's "Israel", McKelvie was sacked from the band for "confusing the band's direction".MILESAGO: Australasian Music & Popular Culture 1964-1975 "The Flying Circus"
McKelvie released singles as a solo artist and as leader of The Third Union Band and was lead guitarist on the first two Richard Clapton albums, including playing all the multilayered electric guitar on the Australian number two hit "Girls On The Avenue".
He returned to New Zealand in 1975 where he became a highly sought after session musician, performed on Television New Zealand's primetime That's Country show and produced recordings for the country's queen of country music Patsy Riggir.
Bands McKelvie played with in Auckland, New Zealand, in the 1970s to the 1990s included Cruise Lane, with New Zealand's jingles king Murray Grindlay and Dragon songwriter Paul Hewson, the Al Hunter Band, the Glen Moffatt Band and his own Cajun combo Mumbo Gumbo.
McKelvie returned to his home town of Christchurch in 1997, and in 2007 finally released his debut solo album, Ridin' On Trains - Songs of New Zealand and Australia. Eight of the songs from the album appeared on the 2009 release Troubadours - NZ Singer/Songwriter Series: Vol 1, which also featured Glen Moffatt and Al Hunter.

[[Weightlessness]]

CATEGORIES: Gravitation, Space medicine

Weightlessness, or an absence of 'weight', is in fact an absence of stress and strain resulting from externally applied forces, typically contact forces from floors, seats, beds, scales, and the like. Counterintuitively, a uniform gravitational field does not by itself cause stress or strain, and a body in free fall in such an environment experiences no g-force acceleration and feels weightless. This is also termed zero-g.
When bodies are acted upon by non-gravitational forces, as in a centrifuge, a rotating space station, or within a space ship with rockets firing, a sensation of weight is produced, as the forces overcome the body's inertia. In such cases, a sensation of weight, in the sense of a state of stress can occur, even if the gravitational field were zero. In such cases, g-forces are felt, and bodies are not weightless.
When the gravitational field is non-uniform, a body in free fall suffers tidal effects and is not stress-free. Near a black hole, such tidal effects can be very strong. In the case of the Earth, the effects are minor, especially on objects of relatively small dimension (such as the human body or a spacecraft) and the overall sensation of weightlessness in these cases is preserved. This condition is known as microgravity and it prevails in orbiting spacecraft.

[[Housing Commission of Victoria]]

CATEGORIES: Government agencies of Victoria (Australia), Public housing in Australia, Public policy in Australia

The Housing Commission of Victoria (colloquially known as the Housing Commission) was a State Government body responsible for public housing in Victoria, Australia. Responsible to the Victorian Minister for Housing, it was established in 1938 and existed until replaced by the Victorian Office of Housing.
Its most notable legacy was the tens of thousands of buildings either acquired or constructed to provide more affordable housing for residents of Melbourne and other Victorian towns, including the construction of 40–45 individual precast concrete high-rise apartments in inner Melbourne. Though the Commission arguably often operated with the best of intentions, few would agree that its influence was benign or that its original ideal of replacing slums with modern and functional housing (and communities) was met. The high-rise apartments are popularly considered as a scar on the Melbourne cityscape, and successive governments have actively worked towards their demolition or gentrification.

Because of the uncertainty,[tpl]harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=67[/tpl]: "Though almost nothing of it survives, except for names, the Illyrian language has figured prominently in several theories regarding the spread of Indo-European languages into Europe." most sources provisionally place the Illyrian language family on its own branch of Indo-European, though its relation to other languages, ancient and modern, continues to be studied.

Nevertheless, they differ from other oligochaetes in significant ways. For example, leeches do not have bristles and the external segmentation of their bodies does not correspond with the internal segmentation of their organs. Their bodies are much more solid as the spaces in their coelom are dense with connective tissues. They also have two suckers, one at each end.

Leonard Cohen is a Canadian singer-songwriter and poet active in music since 1967. Cohen has released 12 studio albums and 6 live albums during the course of a recording career lasting over 45 years, throughout which he has remained an active poet. His entire catalogue is available on Columbia Records. His 1967 debut Songs of Leonard Cohen earned an RIAA gold record; he followed up with three more highly acclaimed albums: Songs From A Room (1969), Songs Of Love And Hate (1971) and New Skin For The Old Ceremony (1974), before allowing Phil Spector to produce Death of a Ladies' Man for Warner Bros. Records in 1977. Cohen returned to Columbia in 1979 for Recent Songs, but the label declined to release his next album, Various Positions (1984) in the US, leaving it to American shops to import it from CBS Canada. In 1988, Columbia got behind Cohen again and gave full support to I'm Your Man, which brought his career to new heights, and Cohen followed it with 1992's The Future. Cohen then took a nine-year hiatus, and returned with Ten New Songs in (2001). His newest album, Old Ideas (2012), peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart, the highest ranking ever for a Leonard Cohen album. His five live albums include Live Songs (1973), Cohen Live: Leonard Cohen in Concert (1994), Live in London (2009) and Songs from the Road, (2010) from his 2008–2009 world tour, and Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 (2009).

Mostich ([tpl]lang-bg|Мостич[/tpl], Old Bulgarian: МОСТИЧЬ) was a high-ranking official in the 10th-century First Bulgarian Empire, during the rule of Simeon I and Peter I. He bore the title of Ichirgu-boil and was most likely the commander of the state capital Preslav's garrison.
Mostich is known from a 10th-century Old Bulgarian epigraph in a church (now known as "Mostich's Church") in the Selishte area of Preslav, then the inner city of the Bulgarian capital. The text was discovered in 1952 by Professor Stancho Vaklinov and is preserved in the National Archaeological Museum. The inscription is Mostich's epitaph, indicating that he was buried in the church: his remains were also found, revealing that he was relatively short (165–170 cm). The text is notable for being the earliest source mentioning the word "Tsar".
It reads as follows:

Mostich Hill on Rugged Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Mostich.

CATEGORIES: People of Elizabethan Ireland, 1599 deaths, People from Drogheda, Irish Roman Catholics, People executed under Elizabeth I of England by hanging, drawing and quartering, Year of birth unknown, 16th-century Irish people, Irish people executed by hanging, drawing and quartering

James Dowdall (date of birth unknown; executed at Exeter, England, 20 September 1600) was a Roman Catholic merchant of Drogheda, Ireland.Several authorities, including Challoner, describe him as a native of Wexford. Further confusion is added by reason of the fact that another contemporary, James Dowdall, died a confessor. According to Rothe, however, the Catholic martyr belonged to Drogheda, and traded with England and the Continent. The Dowdalls of Louth originated at Dovedale in Derbyshire and became prominent in Ireland in the late Middle Ages.Otway-Ruthven, A. J.  A History of Mediaeval Ireland  Barnes and Noble 1993 p.116James Dowdall, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, who died in 1584 was probably a cousin of the martyr.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.210
In the summer of 1598, when returning from France, his ship was driven by stress of weather onto the coast of Devonshire, and he was arrested by William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath, who had him under examination. Dowdall publicly avowed that he rejected the supremacy of Elizabeth I of England, and only recognized that of the Pope. 
The earl forwarded the examination to Sir Robert Cecil, and had Dowdall committed to Exeter jail. Whilst in prison he was tortured and put to the rack, but continued unchanged in his Catholicism. On 18 June 1599, the Earl of Bath wrote to Sir Robert Cecil for instructions in regard to James Dowdall, who had been detained in prison almost a year. Accordingly he was tried at the Exeter assizes, and was ordered to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. 
His name was included in the Apostolic Process of the Irish Martyrs before the Congregation of Sacred Rites. It stalled, apparently because of the uncertainty of identification of the James Dowdalls.

The B-trie is a trie-based data structure that can store and retrieve variable-length strings efficiently on disk.[tpl]Citation | title=B-tries for Disk-based String Management | first1=Nikolas | last1=Askitis | first2=Justin | last2=Zobel | year=2008 | issn=1066-8888 | pages=1–26 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x7545u2g85675u17/  | journal=VLDB Journal[/tpl]
The B-trie was compared against several high-performance variants of B-tree that were
designed for string keys. It was shown to offer superior performance, particularly under skew access (i.e., many repeated searches). It is currently a leading choice for maintaining a string dictionary on disk, along with other disk-based tasks, such as maintaining an index to a string database or for accumulating the vocabulary of a large text collection.

[[St Monica Choir]]

CATEGORIES: Choirs, Musical groups established in 1964

Founded in 1964 by Sr Beniamina Portelli, the St Monica Choir is one of Malta's leading polyphonic choirs. The choir’s repertoire varies from sacred to popular, early to contemporary. 
For over 20 years, it has been collaborating with other entities and exchanging visits with foreign choirs and travelling to European countries. The choir has, amongst others, presented concerts at the Liverpool Philharmonic Theatre, the Vatican City, St. Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna, Esztergom Cathedral in Hungary and St Mary’s Cathedral in Edinburgh, as well as televised and radio recordings for renowned media stations such as the BBC and the German ARD 1. Amongst the choir’s participation with foreign choirs, one cannot but mention the Knox Academy Choir from Scotland and the Beethoven Society of Australia. With the latter, the St Monica Choir presented a memorable production of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony with Orkestra Nazzjonali under the baton of Dr Steve Watson at the Teatru Manoel in May 1999. The St Monica Choir has been commissioned to premiere local compositions, such as Stabat Mater by prolific Maltese composer Carmelo Pace together with Orkestra Nazzjonali (the national orchestra) and Mro Michael Laus. Early 2007 saw yet another collaboration come to fruition, this time together with Vocalise, when, for the first time in Malta, Johann Sebastian Bach’s Christmas Oratorio Parts I, II & III were performed at St John's Co-Cathedral under the direction of international conductor and musicologist Hans Jürgen Nagel.
In November 1999, the St Monica Choir became the first and only Maltese choir to win the prestigious Malta International Choir Festival. Delegated to represent Malta during the first edition of the choral Olympics held in Linz, Austria, the following year, the choir was awarded bronze 1 from amongst over twenty participants in the mixed choirs’ category. September 2001 marked yet another milestone in the choir’s history when it launched its own compilation of varied musical compositions on CD entitled Expressions.
In 2002, the choir was invited to make a guest appearance during a choral festival at the Dorog House of Culture in Hungary. Two years later, the choir was once again invited to participate in the “XIII Festival de Musica en Navidad” organized by the Cultural Department of Madrid. The St Monica Choir, the only foreign choir invited to participate, held its concert at the Sagrada Familia church in Madrid. 
In 2004, to commemorate its 40th Anniversary since its foundation, the choir launched a comprehensive website and a documentary on DVD encompassing forty years of existence and achievements. The choir’s own productions of its Easter and Christmas concerts, helped raise further funds for the missions. In 2006, the St Monica Choir performed a concert in Haddington, Scotland to help raise funds for the local church there. 
The choir is an affiliated member of Förderverein Interkultur, organizers of the Choir Olympics and other Musica Mundi concerts worldwide.

Navigation is only possible for the first 100 metres from the downstream end, where a few temporary moorings are available, except for smaller boats.
Cookham lock opened in 1830, but no weir was built at this time. In 1832 Lord Boston of Hedsor House claimed compensation for loss of towpath rights along Hedsor Water which he was granted. In 1837 a weir was found necessary and built across Hedsor Water, leading to further litigation from Lord Boston for loss of trade to the wharf he owned there. Hedsor Wharf, on the upper reach of Hedsor Water had been an important trading post. The paper made at nearby Cookham Paper Mill was shipped from there and the stone used to build Shardeloes was brought from Oxford to Hedsor Wharf. This time the only compensation he received was the building of a flash lock in the weir. This was removed when the lock was rebuilt in 1869, as Lord Boston had built eel bucks in the stream in the meantime.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles
In 2003 Hedsor Water was the subject of a High Court judgement against Josie Rowland, the widow of Tiny Rowland and current owner of Hedsor Wharf Estate, who wanted to stop the Water being used as a public right of way.Rowland vs The Environment Agency

The square was named after a former rector of the Catholic University Leuven, Monseigneur Paulin Ladeuze.  The Ladeuzeplein is the largest square in Leuven.  Until World War II it was called the Volksplaats or People's Place.
Among the local population the square was known as the Jerkarlisse.  This name is derived from the Clarisse religious order who used to have a monastery at this location, when it still was a sandy hill (Jer refers in the local dialect to dirt, thus unpaved, as contrary to the adjacent Stiënkarlisse, the former paved Graanmarkt, now Herbert Hooverplein). In 1783 the monastery was abolished and the city of Leuven bought the estate from the Belgian authorities, who had inherited it, in order to establish a market dedicated to the sale of wood.  The hill was leveled off and the first house on the square was erected in 1812.  At this time the square was named Place Napoleon, later it was renamed the Volksplaats and eventually it became the Mgr. Ladeuzeplein.

[[Duke of Guarda]]

CATEGORIES: Dukes of Guarda, Dukedoms of Portugal, Portuguese nobility

The title of Duke of Guarda (in Portuguese, Duque da Guarda) was granted by a royal decree dated from October 5, 1530, by King John III of Portugal to his younger brother, Infante Ferdinand.
Some authors say the Infante was also made Duke of Trancoso (in Portuguese, Duque de Trancoso) in the same date (according to Arquivo do Conselho Nobiliárquico de Portugal, Vol I, 78).
However, the majority of historians defend that the Dukedom of Trancoso did not exist, and the confusion comes from the fact that Infante Ferdinand (Fernando, in Portuguese) was also Lord of Trancoso.
Finally, others say he was Duke of Guarda and Trancoso (a jointly Dukedom).
One thing is for sure: Infante Ferdinand was the sole to bear the title of Duke of Guarda.
According to his father's (King Manuel I) will, Infant Ferdinand should married the richest and prestigious heir Dona Guiomar Coutinho, 5th Countess of Marialva and 3rd Countess of Loulé.
But when the Infante marriage was announced, the 1st Marquis of Torres Novas (who later became the 1st Duke of Aveiro) declared he had secretly married the richest heir. The scandal in the Court ended when King John III ordered the Marquis imprisonment for several years, allowing the celebration of the Infante Ferdinand's marriage.
In spite of their short but happy marriage, they had two children (a boy and a girl), who died in very young age, before their parents.

The Battle of Morar was a Scottish clan battle fought in 1602, near Loch Morar, in the Scottish Highlands.’Conflicts of the Clans’ published in 1764 by the Foulis press, written from a manuscript wrote in the reign of James VI of Scotland. http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/conflict/  It was fought between the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry against the Clan Mackenzie who were supported by the Clan Ross."A History of the Clan Mackenzie by Alexander Mackenzie.
A feud took place between the Mackenzies, led by Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail and the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry. The Mackenzies wanted the MacDonell Laird of Glengarry to appear before the Justice court at Edinburgh for previous crimes against them. Meanwhile two MacDonells were killed. Glengarry MacDonell did not appear in court on the arranged date but went about his own hand to revenge the slaughter of his clansmen.  As he did not appear in court the Mackenzies wasted the MacDonell country of Morar. The two sides met and a battle took place with great slaughter on both sides. According to historian Alexander Mackenzie the Clan Mackenzie were supported by the Clan Ross at the battle of Morar. This was due to Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail being married to Ann Ross daughter of George Ross of Balnagowan, chief of Clan Ross. After this they came to an agreement to obtain peace where Glengarry MacDonald was glad to requite and renounce to the Lord MacKenzie of Kintail, and give him the inheritance of the lands of Strome.

[[Sufi Amba Prasad]]
CATEGORIES: Revolutionary movement for Indian independence, Hindu–German Conspiracy, Pan-Islamism, 1919 deaths, 1858 births

Amba Prasad, (1858–1919) also known as Sufi Amba Prasad, was an Indian nationalist and pan-Islamist leader notable for his involvement in the agrarian unrest in Punjab in 1900s and subsequently in the Revolutionary movement for Indian independence.[tpl]Harvnb|Ahluwalia|1965|p=353[/tpl] 
Prasad was born in 1858 in the north Indian city of Moradabad, then in the United Provinces (now in Uttar Pradesh). Prasad was born without his right hand. He later worked as a journalist in Moradabad when he became involved in the emerging nationalist movement. He was at this time the editor of the Peshwa. His editorials were noted for sarcastic and unsparing criticisms of the Punjab government policies. He was incarcerated twice in 1897.[tpl]Harvnb|Rai|1978|p=19[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Yadav|Singh|2006|p=25[/tpl]
In 1900, Prasad became involved in the agrarian movement that was emerging in Punjab in response to the much criticised Bari Doab Canal act and the Colonization act.His associates at the time included Sardar Ajit Singh (uncle of Bhagat Singh), Mahasha Ghaseeta Ram, Kartar Singh and Lala Lajpat Rai. In 1906, Prasad was one of the key founding members of the Bharat Mata Society.[tpl]Harvnb|Radhan|2002|p=351[/tpl]  A crackdown later forced him to flee India for Nepal in 1907, where he was granted asylum by Deva Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana.  Prasad later fled India for  Persia.[tpl]Harvnb|Gupta|1972|p=84[/tpl]
Around the 1910s, Indian nationalists groups, especially pan-Islamic ones, were growing in Turkey and Persia under the leadership of Sardar Ajit Singh and Sufi Amba Prasad who began their work there around 1909.[tpl]Harvnb|Yadav|1992|p=29[/tpl] The recruits to these groups included young radicals of the likes of Rhishikesh Letha, Zia-ul-Haq, and Thakur Das. By 1910, the activities of these groups and their publication, the Hayat, had come under the observation of British intelligence, while .[tpl]Harvnb|Yadav|1992|p=30[/tpl] However, Ajit Singh's departure in 1911 brought the Indian revolutionary activities to a grinding halt, while British representations to Persia successfully curbed whatever activity that remained in the country.
However, as World War I began, Prasad again became involved in the Indian revolutionary conspiracy. He was at this time associated with Indian revolutionaries of the likes of Har Dayal and Mahendra Pratap.[tpl]Harvnb|Punjab Government|1962|p=14[/tpl] Sufi worked with the revolutionaries of the Berlin Committee in Mesopotamia and Middle East, attempting to spread propaganda among Indian troops of the Indian expeditionary force. His attempts were directed at organising Indian troops into a nationalist force incursions from the western border of India from Persia, through Baluchistan, to Punjab. Amba Prasad was joined during the war by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry. These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman and the detention of the British consul there, and also successfully harassed Percy Sykes' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans.[tpl]Harvnb|Sykes|1921|p=101[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Herbert|2003|p=[/tpl] The Aga Khan's brother was killed while fighting the rebels.
The rebels also successfully harassed British Forces in Sistan in Afghanistan, confining them to Karamshir in Baluchistan, and later moving towards Karachi. Some reports indicate they took control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar. The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from British rule, also joined the Ghadarites. It was not before the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and Baghdad was captured by the British forces that the Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged. They retreated to regroup at Shiraz, where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of Shiraz. Amba Prasad Sufi was killed in this battle, but the Ghadarites carried on guerrilla warfare along with Iranian partisans until 1919. The works of Amba Prasad had a significant impact on Bhagat Singh.

A quark–gluon plasma (QGP) or quark soup[tpl]cite journal|bibcode=1977NuPhB.128..275B|author1=Bohr, Henrik|author2=Nielsen, H. B.|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(77)90032-3|year=1977|pages=275|issue=2|volume=128|journal=Nuclear Physics B |title=Hadron production from a boiling quark soup:  quark model predicting particle ratios in hadronic collisions[/tpl] is a  phase of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which is hypothesized to exist at extremely high temperature, density, or both temperature and density. This phase is thought to consist of asymptotically free quarks and gluons, which are several of the basic building blocks of matter.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]. It is believed that few milliseconds after the big bang the Universe was in a Quark-Gluon Plasma state.
The strength of the color force means that unlike the gas-like plasma, quark-gluon plasma behaves as a near-ideal Fermi liquid, although research on flow characteristics is ongoing.Quark-gluon plasma goes liquid - physicsworld.com In the quark matter phase diagram, QGP is placed in the high-temperature, high-density regime; whereas, ordinary matter is a cold and rarefied mixture of nuclei and vacuum, and the hypothetical quark stars would consist of relatively cold, but dense quark matter.
Experiments at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) first tried to create the QGP in the 1980s and 1990s: the results led CERN to announce indirect evidence for a "new state of matter"A New State of Matter - Experiments in 2000. Current experiments (2011) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) on Long Island (NY, USA) and at CERN's recent Large Hadron Collider near Geneva (Switzerland) are continuing this effort,Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC by colliding relativistically accelerated gold (at RHIC) or lead (at LHC) with each other or with protons. Although the results have yet to be independently verified as of February 2010, scientists at Brookhaven RHIC have tentatively claimed to have created a quark-gluon plasma with an approximate temperature of 4 trillion (4×1012) degrees Celsius.http://www.bnl.gov/rhic/news2/news.asp?a=1074&t=pr 'Perfect' Liquid Hot Enough to be Quark Soup
As already mentioned, three new experiments running on CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), on the spectrometers ALICE,Alice Experiment: Welcome to ALICE Portal ATLAS and CMS, will continue studying properties of QGP. Starting in November 2010, CERN temporarily ceased colliding protons, and began colliding lead Ions for the ALICE experiment. They were looking to create a QGP and were expected to stop December 6, colliding protons again in January.CERN Press Release November 4th 2010 A new record breaking temperature was set by ALICE: A Large Ion Collider Experiment at CERN on August, 2012 in the ranges of 5.5 trillion (5.5×1012) degrees Celsius as claimed in their Nature PR.Hot stuff: CERN physicists create record-breaking subatomic soup : Nature News Blog

Vicente Acosta (July 24 1867 - July 24 1908) was a Salvadoran poet. 
Born in Apopa, Acosta published various diaries and papers, notably Diario del Salvador, La juventud salvadoreña, La república de Centro América, and El Fígaro. He was active in the newspaper La Unión, in which he signed under the pseudonym Flirt. At the time of the coup d'état of the Antonio brothers and Carlos Ezeta in 1890, Acosta was forced to flee from the country and did not return until it ended in 1894. 
In 1904, he was founding director of La Quincena, an important cultural and scientific journal of the time. He participated with such people as Francisco Gavidia, Santiago I. Barberena and brother of the writer, Arthur Ambrogi. According to David Escobar Galindo, Acosta was "one with romantic impulse, but soon found it better to write in modernism. He was modernist in two slopes: cosmic-metaphysics and vernacular".David Escobar Galindo, Indice Antológico de la Poesía Salvadoreña, San Salvador: UCA Editores, 1982 Francisco Gavidia mentioned Acosta describing him as "a sweet poet, of great descriptive dowries".
He died in 1908 in Tegucigalpa and collections of his poems were published after his death. An anthology was released in 1924.

At this point,the road is a dual-carriageway as it heads south-east along Hall Street to the Public Library, then south-west along Church Street and past the town council, government buildings, then south-east again past the town hall and county council offices.  Here, the road turns into a single-carriageway as it becomes Station Road to the junction with the B4303 and Queen Victoria Road.  The road takes a 90-degree to the north-east along Murray Street towards the Asda Supermarket.
Following construction of the Asda Supermarket in the middle of the town centre, the road takes a detour around the car-park, first running south-east along Bres Road, then north-east along Upper Robinson Street then north-west along Stepney Place, before rejoining the original route.  The road then continues north-east until it reaches Swansea Castle Roundabout, with the junction of the A484.
Inside this ring-road is the main commerce area of Llanelli, including the shopping centre, supermarket, indoor and outdoor markets, bus-station, high street shops as well as multi-story, off-street and street parking.

[[Small Farmers Party]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct political parties in Finland, Political parties established in 1936

Party of Smallholders and Rural People ([tpl]lang-fi|Pienviljelijäin ja maalaiskansan puolue[/tpl], PMP), later renamed as the Small Farmers Party (Pienviljelijäin puolue), was a political party in Finland. The party was founded in Seinäjoki on December 20, 1936, through the unification of Smallholders' Party of Finland (SPP), People's Party and Central League of Recession Committees. Most members of the new party came from the SPP and the organization was mainly built on the basis of the SPP. Eino Yliruusi became chairman of the new party. 
The PMP had mainly a populist profile. However, because of the radical rhetoric of Yliruusi and the party's negative attitude to fascism and war, it was also seen as leftist. Some sections and members of the PMP had links to the underground Communist Party of Finland, who favoured cooperation with PMP as part of its popular front policy. The PMP leadership did however deny all forms of linkages with the communists.Lackman, Matti. Taistelu talonpojasta. Suomen Kommunistisen Puolueen suhde talonpoikaiskysymykseen ja talonpoikaisliikkeisiin 1918–1939 (Pohjoinen 1985), pp. 292–313.
The party published Suomen Pienviljelijä and Pohjanmaan Sana.
During the Winter War, the PMP criticized the pro-German policies of the government. As a result, the party organ Suomen Pienviljelijä was closed down in 1939. Yliruusi attempted to start a new publication, Suomen Sanomia, but it was rapidly closed down by the authorities. In 1941 both of the PMP MPs left the party and joined the Agrarian League. The party participated in elections until 1954 but it never returned to the parliament.

[[Girls under Pressure]]

CATEGORIES: 1998 novels, British children's novels, Novels by Jacqueline Wilson

Girls under Pressure is the second book in the Girls series, written by Dame Jacqueline Wilson, DBE, a noted English author who writes fiction for children. It was published in 1998, the sequel to Girls in Love and followed by Girls out Late. It is aimed at pre-teen and teenage readers.
Like the rest of the series, Girls under Pressure is told from the viewpoint of Eleanor "Ellie" Allard, a chubby thirteen-year-old girl who lives with her father, her stepmother, Anna, and her little half-brother, Eggs.
The story starts where Ellie and her two best friends, Magda and Nadine, are Christmas shopping at the Flowerfields Shopping Centre. While they shop, they notice a large buzz of an event going on upstairs. Nadine wonders if it is television. Magda replies, "Wow, I hope so" and steers the other two upstairs. 
It turns out to be a modelling competition for Spicy magazine, which Ellie discovers after seeing a lot of pretty and thin teenage girls getting their photos taken. Ellie stares in horror as she realises what she has been in the queue for. She witnesses Magda and Nadine being photographed, seeing how Nadine is "model-girl" thin. It is Ellie's turn to be photographed, but she runs away, pushing through the queue as she goes, with the result that one of the girls says, "She's far too fat!" (for modelling). Ellie, hurt and upset, leaves and goes home. This is where her obsessive dieting starts and she battles with a messy form of dieting, making herself sick once or twice, although it is not actually an eating disorder as she finds it very easy to recover as soon as she realises she must stop.
It worsens when Nadine gets through to the first round of the Spicy modelling competition. Ellie tries to be supportive but envies all of the models and their bodies. However, Nadine is not chosen to go through to the next round and the two quarrel, but make it up on the way home. Meanwhile, Magda has been on a date with Mick and is nearly a victim of date-rape.
Ellie once did an Art project with Zoe, a highly intelligent student who has been put up a year to take her GCSEs early. Ellie is motivated to lose weight by not eating as Zoe had a "biggish bum" and now she has "amazing cheekbones", due to her lack of food and lots of exercise. However, Ellie eventually stops after hearing that Zoe got so thin she collapsed and nearly died of heart failure. She goes to visit the hospital for girls with eating disorders that Zoe is in, and she is shocked by how sad and small Zoe looks. So, she promptly stops her diet, as she does not want to die.

In 1705 it was rebuilt by architect Pierre-Alexis Delamair (1676-1745) for François de Rohan-Soubise and Anne-de Rohan Chabot, with little remaining of the original structure but its turreted medieval gateway which is now the only surviving remnant of Parisian private architecture from the fourteenth century. The adjoining Hôtel de Rohan was built at the same time. In 1808 both buildings were acquired by the state, after which Napoleon designated the Hôtel de Soubise for the Imperial Archives and the Hôtel de Rohan as the National Printing House (which so remained until 1927). In 1867 Napoleon III created the Musée de l'Histoire de France in the Hôtel de Soubise.
Until 2001 the museum displayed rotating selections from its permanent collection in the Hôtel de Soubise, with temporary exhibits that sometimes expanded into the Hôtel de Rohan. The collection included documents that date from the Merovingian period before Charlemagne, documents and the only known sketch of Joan of Arc, Louis XVI's will and facsimiles of Marie Antoinette's farewell letter composed just before her execution, documents by Danton, Robespierre, and Napoleon, as well as jailers' keys from the Bastille.
The Hôtels de Soubise and de Rohan are also notable for their architecture and furnishings, with rooms that have changed very little since the 18th century, including the Chambre du prince, Salon ovale du prince, Chambre d'apparat de la princesse, an amusing Cabinet des singes (Monkey Cabinet), and the very fine Salon ovale de la princesse with featuring gilt and crystal decor and ceiling frescoes by François Boucher, Charles-Joseph Natoire, and Carle Van Loo.

Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, 64 MCC 769 (1955) is a landmark civil rights case in the United States in which the Interstate Commerce Commission, in response to a bus segregation complaint filed in 1953 by a Women's Army Corps (WAC) private named Sarah Louise Keys, broke with its historic adherence to the Plessy v. Ferguson separate but equal doctrine and interpreted the non-discrimination language of the Interstate Commerce Act as banning the segregation of black passengers in buses traveling across state lines.Barnes, Journey from Jim Crow, p. 99-100
The case was argued on the eve of the explosion of the civil rights protest movement by Washington D.C. lawyer Julius Winfield Robertson and his partner Dovey Johnson Roundtree, a former WAC whose experience with Jim Crow bus travel during her World War II Army recruiting days caused her to take on the Sarah Keys case as a personal mission.McCabe, Katie, Washingtonian, March 2002, pp. 124-125McCabe and Roundtree, Justice Older than the Law  Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, along with its companion train desegregation case, NAACP v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company, 298 ICC 355 (1955), represents a milestone in the legal battle for civil rights. The November 1955 ruling, publicly announced six days before Rosa Parks' historic defiance of state Jim Crow laws on Montgomery buses,Barnes, p. 108 applied the United States Supreme Court's logic in Brown v. Board of Education (347 US 483 (1954) for the first time to the field of interstate transportation, and closed the legal loophole that private bus companies had long exploited to impose their own Jim Crow regulations on black interstate travelers.Barnes, pp. 98-100 Keys v. Carolina Coach was the only explicit rejection ever made by either a court or a federal administrative body of the Plessy v. Ferguson doctrine (Plessy, 163 US 537 (1896)) in the field of bus travel across state lines.Barnes, pp. 86-107 The ruling made legal history both at the time of its issuance and again in 1961, when Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invoked it in his successful battle to end Jim Crow travel during the Freedom Riders' campaign.Petition for Rule Making to the ICC, Attorney General of the US, May 29, 1961

Hannah tells the story of Hannah and of her devotion to God which resulted in her being blessed with fertility by God. It was the first of two oratorio librettos written by Smart, the second being Abimelech.

Abimelech is an oratorio in three acts written by Christopher Smart and put to music by Samuel Arnold. It was first performed in Haymarket Theatre in 1768. A heavily revised version of the oratorio ran at the Covent Garden in 1772. Abimelech was the second of two oratorio librettos written by Smart, the first being Hannah written in 1764. Just like Hannah, Abimelech ran for only one night, each time. It was to be Smart's last work dedicated to an adult audience.
Abimelech retells the biblical story of Abraham and Sarah when they met the King of Gerar, Abimelech, and he tries to take Sarah as his wife. After God intervenes in a dream, Sarah, who was previously barren, is restored to Abraham and made fertile. The oratorio emphasizes the sexual jealousy and the sexual fidelity of spouses.

[[Will to live]]
CATEGORIES: Ego psychology, Motivation, Metaphysics

The will to live is a psychological force to fight for survival seen as an important and active process of conscious and unconscious reasoning. This occurs particularly when one’s own life is threatened by a serious injury or disease. The idea in which someone who is on the threshold of death may consciously or unconsciously try to stay alive through the belief that they have a reason or something to live for, along with giving up on the will to live. There are significant correlations between the will to live and existential, psychological, social, and physical sources of distress."Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death". The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine (2005) The concept of the will to live can be seen as directly impacted by hope.  Many, who overcome near-death experiences with no explanation, have described concepts such as the will to live as a direct component of their survival.No Author (2003). What is the Will to Live.

[[Symphony No. 11 (Mozart)]]
CATEGORIES: Symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Compositions in D major, 1770 compositions

Symphony No. 11 in D major, K. 84/73q, was at one time considered unquestionably to be the work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Its status has, however, been challenged, and (as of 2008) remains uncertain. It is believed to date from 1770, and may have been written in Milan or Bologna, if it is a genuine Mozart work. An early manuscript from Vienna attributes the work to Wolfgang, but nineteenth century copies of the score attribute it respectively to Leopold Mozart and to Carl Dittersdorf. Neal Zaslaw writes: "A comparison of the results of two stylistic analyses of the work's first movement with analyses of unquestionably genuine first movements of the period by the three composers suggests that Wolfgang is the most likely of the three to have been the composer of K73q".Zaslaw, pp. 175–77Dearling, p. 71
The symphony is in three movements, lacking a minuet and trio. Kenyon opines that there is "little special" about the work,Kenyon, p. 155 while Zaslaw finds a "Gluckish ambience", and some affinity with opera buffa in the repeated triplets found in the Finale.

CATEGORIES: Colombian writers, Colombian novelists, Year of death missing, Year of birth missing

Luis Castellanos Tapias  was a Colombian attorney (Universidad Externado de Colombia), historian, politician, publisher and writer.
Castellanos Tapias (who studied history with José Fulgencio Gutiérrez, prominent historian from Bucaramanga, Santander, and author of the historical study "Galán y los Comuneros"), published in 1962 a novel that has as its main historical reference the insurrection of the Comuneros (1781) in the Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada, "El Alzamiento" or 'The Uprising.'  Castellanos Tapias is also the author of at least two other unpublished novels, "El Amo", or 'The Master' and "La Muerte del Juez Barton" or "The Death of Judge Barton."   Records show him also as the author of a technical report and a census on the tobacco industry in Colombia for Instituto Nacional de Fomento Tabacalero (INTABACO)and at least one article on the economics of business cycles.
Castellanos was a member of the conservative party and occupied several prominent provincial and national positions, among them Secretary of Government (Departmental Interior Secretary)under Santander Governor Rafael Ortiz Gonzales during the period leading to the political crisis of April 1948. From his governmental positions Castellanos Tapias was instrumental, together with other Santander leaders, in promoting the founding of the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), one of the truly prestigious Colombian universities, of which he was the second president ("rector.")   After studying industrial statistics with an ONU scholarship in USA and Canada, he intervened in the founding and was the leading executive of the Departamento Nacional de Estadística (National Department of Statistics), the forerunner of today's DANE (Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadísticas).
Castellanos was also leading assistant to the minister of Agriculture and on occasion, acting minister of Agriculture. Later on he was the leading executive (Gerente General) of the Instituto Nacional de Fomento Tabacalero (INTABACO). Castellanos was founder and publisher of the short-lived "La Nación Agrícola" magazine. Towards the end of his life he was also a Notary, a Judge and the president of the Directorio Conservador in Barrancabermeja, Santander. While living in Barrancabermeja Castellanos Tapias was made a full member ("Miembro de Número") of the Academy of History of Santander and was chosen to preside over the founding of the Centro de Historia de Barrancabermeja, the local chapter of the Academy of History of Santander.

RSVP was a vertical version of Scrabble introduced by Selchow and Righter in 1958 and promoted as "3-D Scrabble". Two players spelled words using cubical tiles with letters on an upright grid board.
RSVP was sold in the UK under the Spear's Games label as item #1051 (Copyright 1966 by Production and Marketing Company, 1968 J. W. Spear & Sons Ltd) with the how to play/rules printed inside the box lid.
The playing space is a dark blue vertical frame, held upright by two detachable black feet, with 11 x 11 square holes with 75 wooden block lettered playing pieces available to place within that frame. The letter blocks are similar to regular Scrabble tiles showing a large letter and a small number for their scoring point value (identical on their opposing faces). There are no 'blank' blocks.
From the introduction inside the box lid:
"RSVP is played on both sides of an upright frame by two players. The object of the game is to form horizontal and vertical words by placing letter blocks in crossword fashion on your side of the frame while blocking the formation of words on the opposite side. It is to each player's advantage to place letter blocks so that they cannot be used by his opponent and, whenever possible, to use letters placed from the opposite side. A total to be played to is determined at the start of the game - usually 100 points."

Mercury was the name used by the New York Central Railroad for a family of daytime streamliner passenger trains operating between midwestern cities. The Mercury train sets were designed by the noted industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss, and are considered a prime example of Art Deco design. The success of the Mercury led to Dreyfuss  getting the commission for the 1938 redesign of the NYC's flagship, the 20th Century Limited, perhaps the most famous train in America.
The first Mercury, operating on a daily roundtrip between Cleveland and Detroit, was introduced on July 13, 1936.Cook, p. 2 The Chicago Mercury, between Chicago and Detroit, and the Cincinnati Mercury, between Cincinnati and Detroit, followed.Cook, pp. 7, 10 The Mercurys lasted until the 1950s, with the final survivor, the original Cleveland Mercury, making its last run on July 11, 1959.Cook, p. 11
A fourth train, the James Whitcomb Riley between Chicago and Cincinnati, used the same design for its train sets and is considered part of the Mercury family, although it did not bear the Mercury name. The Riley debuted in 1941 and lasted into the Amtrak era, though no longer a streamliner.Cook, p. 9James Whitcomb Riley (passenger train)

Nathaniel Wood, Sr., was the leader of a sect called the New Israelites, which was formed in Middletown, Rutland County, Vermont at the end of the 1790s. Wood emigrated from Newent Parish in Norwich, Connecticut to Bennington, Vermont. From Bennington he moved to Rutland County in 1761. Wood may have been influenced by the Newent Separates of Norwich, who believed in perfectionist immortalism and spiritual wifery, and the preaching of Rev. Joel Benedict, who taught that Hebrew was the angelic tongue.Brooke, 57-8. See divine language on angelic tongues. Wood was excommunicated from the local Congregationalist  church in 1789. Subsequently, he began to preach to small meetings whose attendees were mostly family and relatives.
Wood claimed literal descent from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel and to possess the powers of revelation. After coming into contact with a treasure seer by the name of Justus Winchell, the New Israelites commenced looking for buried treasure and embarked on the construction of a temple. The group employed the divining rod for both treasure hunting and other forms of revelation. It was suspected that these efforts masked a counterfeiting operation. Wood predicted the arrival of a "Destroying Angel" that would bring down plagues and earthquakes upon the "gentiles." For this reason one might arguably call the New Israelites a Millennarian group. The locals were so alarmed that on the night in question the militia was called out. When this apocalypse failed to occur, Wood and his family moved to Ellisburg, Lawrence County, New York. This event was subsequently known as the "Wood Scrape."

The Battle of Agounennda was an engagement of the Algerian War fought 23–25 May 1957 between the French 3rd Colonial Parachute Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Marcel Bigeard and FLN’s Commando 41 (‘Ali Khodja’) under Si Azzedine. Bigeard and his regiment were sent to hunt down the Commando after it had carried out several successful ambushes against French units. They met at Agounennda where the French paratroopers tried to ambush the FLN force, but the FLN discovered the French and instead concentrated their force against an outlying French company. 
Bigeard managed to redeploy and surround the FLN force; it withdrew successfully albeit with heavy casualties. However, the French were unable to recover large caches of weapons - the FLN having taken them off the field. The battle altered FLN tactics, reminding them that they were unable to meet the French in open battle. Conversely, it gave the French renewed confidence in a military victory. However, sceptics on both sides saw it as evidence that neither faction would ever gain ascendancy in the other's arena. The FLN avoided military combat with the French, relying on guerilla warfare.[tpl]harvnb|Horne|1977|pp=253–254[/tpl].

Crimethinc: In Love With Love Itself. Clamor. Retrieved 2008-01-14
Among their best-known publications are the books Days of War, Nights of Love, Evasion, Recipes for Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook and the pamphlet Fighting For Our Lives (of which, to date, they claim to have printed 600,000 copies), Inside Front and a decade of album releases by North American anarcho-punk artists. Several websites are maintained by individual cells of the collective, including Crimethinc.com, a clearing house for CrimethInc. activities operated by the Far East Cell which hosts excerpts from previously published works as well as a blog.
CrimethInc. is connected to publishing collectives/organizations with similar ideas, notably the Curious George Brigade which has produced a number of works, including Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs.

Work on the series started during Dürer's first trip to Italy (1494–95), and the set was published simultaneously in Latin and German at Nuremberg in 1498, at a time when much of Europe anticipated a possible Last Judgment at 1500. The most famous print in the series is The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (ca. 1497–98),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/durr/ho_19.73.209.htm|title= Albrecht Dürer: Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=2008-07-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080905022342/http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/durr/ho_19.73.209.htm| archivedate= 5 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] referring to [tpl]niv|Revelation|6:1–8|Revelation 6:1–8[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/a/albrecht_d%C3%BCrer_the_four_horsem.aspx|title= Albrecht Dürer The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, a woodcut|publisher=BritishMuseum.org |accessdate=2008-07-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080820012919/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/a/albrecht_d%c3%bcrer_the_four_horsem.aspx| archivedate= 20 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The layout of the cycle with the illustrations on the recto and the text on the verso suggests the privileging of the illustrations over the text. The series brought Dürer fame and wealth as well as some freedom from the patronage system, which, in turn, allowed him to choose his own subjects and to devote more time to engraving. In 1511, Dürer published the second edition of Apocalypse in a combined edition with his Life of the Virgin and Large Passion; single impressions were also produced and sold.Bartrum, 124

The PROPHET system was an early medical expert system.
The system was initiated in about 1965 by a young administrator at NIH, William Raub, who had the idea to set up a collaborative communication network modeled on Arpanet, for use among biomedical investigators to share data and procedures, with a wide range of computational tools, ranging from statistics to molecular orbit calculations.
A panel of NIH advisors planned the system over a couple of years, until Bolt, Beranek and Neman (BBN Technologies) received the contract for implementation.
The PROPHET system was operational for 15 to 20 years before being superseded by more current Internet tools.

This is a list of diplomatic missions of Burundi, excluding honorary consulates. Burundi's relations with its neighbours have often been affected by security concerns. Hundreds of thousands of Burundian refugees have at various times crossed to neighboring Rwanda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians are in neighboring countries as a result of the ongoing civil war. Most of them, more than 340,000 since 1993, are in Tanzania. Some Burundian rebel groups have used neighboring countries as bases for insurgent activities. The 1993 embargo placed on Burundi by regional states hurt diplomatic relations with its neighbors; relations have improved since the 1999 suspension of these sanctions.
Burundi is a member of various international and regional organizations, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the African Development Bank. Burundi is also a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the US-military (as covered under Article 98).

Attendance ranges from 40,000 - 60,000.  The show is five days long, running Wednesday through Sunday, and is typically held in March.  The show consists of three main components:  approximately 25 display gardens ranging from 500 to 1,500 sq. ft. in size, educational displays, vendors promoting and selling garden-related products, and free seminars.  Seminar speakers include garden and design experts from the U.S. West Coast and from Britain.http://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/san-francisco-flower-and-garden-show-full-bloom, San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco Flower and Garden Show in full bloom  Read more at the San Francisco Examiner: http://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/san-francisco-flower-and-garden-show-full-bloom, 03/11/10, Retrieved January 25, 2011.
Two large flower shows that preceded the San Francisco Flower & Garden Show in northern California were the Oakland Spring Flower Show which was produced by the California Association of Nurserymen from 1930 to 1978 (with a three-year hiatus from 1943 to 1945 because of World War II).  In the early 1980s the rock ‘n roll impresario Bill Graham produced two annual flower shows at the Cow Palace.
The show as it appears today was started in 1986 as the San Francisco Landscape Garden Show by volunteers for the Friends of Recreation and Parks in San Francisco as a fundraiser for that organization (in 2006 the organization’s name changed to San Francisco Parks Trust).  The first show featured a tribute garden to San Francisco landscape architect, Thomas Dolliver Church (1902-1978), designed by Pam-Anela Messenger. For its first eleven years (1986-1997) the show held at Ft. Mason in San Francisco. In 1997 Salmon Bay Events, the Seattle-based company owned by Duane and Alice Kelly that had started the Northwest Flower & Garden Show, acquired the San Francisco Landscape Garden Show, changed its name to the San Francisco Flower & Garden Show, and moved the show from Ft. Mason to the Cow Palace. For the next eleven years (1998-2008) it was held at the Cow Palace.
In 2009, Salmon Bay moves the show to the San Mateo Event Center and announced it was closing the show. At the final hour, Special Events, a bay area tent rental company in Livermore, CA owned by Weston Cook, and partner Steve Cannon stepped in and acquired the show.http://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/san-francisco-flower-and-garden-show-full-bloom, San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco Flower and Garden Show in full bloom  Read more at the San Francisco Examiner: http://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/san-francisco-flower-and-garden-show-full-bloom, 03/11/10, Retrieved January 25, 2011.
Still America’s third largest show if its kind,  the show was acquired by business partners Sherry Larsen of Larsen Enterprises, and Maryanne Lucas, Founder and Executive Director of Kids Growing Strong, on May 1, 2013. The show is scheduled to again be held at the San Mateo Event Center in 2014.

Selwo Marina is a small (1.67 hectares) marine park located in Benalmádena, Spain. It is the only park of its kind in Andalusia.
The park has 4 areas; 'Antillas', 'Las Hondonada', 'Amazonia' and 'Isla de Hielo'. 'Antillas' is where the dolphin and sea lion pools are located.  There are 4 large pools, three of which are home to their three bottlenose dolphins, and the last used for interactive programmes such as Swim With a Sea Lion. The main large pool (The 'Show Pool') is used by both the dolphins and sea lions during shows, however the sea lions do not have access to it otherwise.  'Las Hondonada' is the area in which the Bird and Snake Shows take place. There are also aviaries to view the parrots when they aren't performing.  'Amazonia' is a small indoor area containing tank of snakes, lizards, fish, caimans and a collection of others. 'Isla de Hielo' translates to 'Island of Ice' and is home to their collection of penguins. The penguin exhibit mimics that of their natural habitat; the amount of light they receive during the day is relative to what they would receive in the wild, so that during the summer the lights are at their dimmest, and in winter they are at their brightest.

The club's achievements in all major national and international competitions as well as the top scorers are listed. Top scorers in bold were also top scorers of Bundesliga. The list is separated into three parts, coinciding with the three major episodes of German football:
Bayern has won the national championship 22 times, once before the inception of the Bundesliga and twenty-one times since. The club also won the DFB-Pokal 15 times, making them the record holder in number of cups and national championships won. Bayern won six international titles, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967, the UEFA Cup in 1996, the European Cup consecutively three times from 1974 to 1976, and the Champions League in 2001. They are the last club to have won the European Cup three times in a row.
The club has been relegated just once in 1955, but was promoted back to 1st division football the following season. Bayern was not appointed a spot in the Bundesliga at its inception and thus played two additional seasons in the 2nd division from 1963 to 1965.

CATEGORIES: CBS network shows, American television sitcoms, 1992 American television series debuts, 1995 American television series endings, Television shows set in Chicago, Illinois, 1990s American comedy television series

Love & War is an American television sitcom, which aired on CBS from September 21, 1992 to February 1, 1995.
Created by Diane English, the series originally starred Susan Dey as Wally Porter, a Chicago restaurateur, and Jay Thomas as Jack Stein, a sportswriter with whom she had an on-again, off-again romance.
After the first season, however, the show was retooled and Dey was fired by the producers of the show, claiming that she and Thomas had "no chemistry" together.  She was replaced by Annie Potts as Dana Palladino, who bought Porter's restaurant and also became a love interest for Jack.
The first season also featured moments when Jack or Wally would break the fourth wall and address the camera directly, generally using it as an opportunity to discuss an emotional crisis. This mechanic was dropped in later seasons.
One episode featured a guest appearance from Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David as themselves, they did this as a "thank you" to creator Diane English for allowing a brief scene on Murphy Brown in an episode of Seinfeld where Kramer is cast as the titular character's secretary.
The show's supporting cast included Suzie Plakson, Joanna Gleason, Joel Murray, Charles Robinson and Michael Nouri.  John Hancock, who had a recurring role as a judge on L.A. Law with Susan Dey previously, portrayed bartender Ike for the first half of season one, until he died of a heart attack in late 1992.[tpl]cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = John Hancock; Actor, 51 | pages = | language = | work = The New York Times | date = October 15, 1992 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/15/obituaries/john-hancock-actor-51.html | accessdate = [/tpl] His death was subsequently written into the series and he was replaced by actor Charlie Robinson.[tpl]cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=705[/tpl]

The 1975 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships were held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the second time, having hosted them in 1971. This also equaled the most times a city had done so with Copenhagen, Denmark (1950, 1970).
The men's competition consisted of six Canadian (single paddle, open boat) and nine kayak events. Three events were held for the women, all in kayak.
This was the twelfth championships in canoe sprint. It marked the first time in the championships' history in which there was tie for a medal and that happened to be for the gold in the men's K-1 1000 m event between Italy's Oreste Perri and Poland's Grzegorz Śledziewski. The second would occur thirty-five years later in the C-1 200 m (debutted 1994) for the bronze between Canada's Richard Dalton and Ukraine's Yuriy Cheban, neither of who were born in 1975.

[[Rekonstruktionslokomotive]]

CATEGORIES: Steam locomotives of Germany, Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft locomotives

The German term Rekonstruktionslokomotive (abbreviated to: Rekolokomotive or Rekolok) meant 'reconstruction locomotive' and was introduced in 1957 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the GDR. thumb|Class 41 Rekolokomotive
The term was used for classes of steam locomotive that underwent considerable rebuilding in order to improve performance, rectify design faults and redress wartime austerity features. At the same time, repairs were carried out. The 'reconstruction' included, as a minimum, the installation of a new high performance steam generation system. Consequently, a characteristic feature of these Rekoloks is a combustion chamber boiler with rectangular mixing chamber (Mischkasten) in front of the chimney.
On individual classes (Class 58.30), completely new driver's cabs were built, instead of just fitting the new end walls needed after the boiler had been replaced. The worn cast cylinder blocks were sometimes replaced by welded cylinders. Unlike the Deutsche Bundesbahn's conversion programme, the boilers were not matched to the individual locomotive classes, but the locomotives were matched to the new boilers. The price paid for the easy interchangeability of the steam generation system thus achieved, was the extensive changes now required to the locomotive frame. 
Also reconstructed were selected vehicles of those locomotive classes that could not be done away with and from which a long period of operational life was expected.
The first Rekolok, number 50 3501, left Stendal Reichsbahn repair shop (Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk or RAW), which had carried out the work, on 12 November 1957. The first Reko 50, from then on designated as Class 50.35, was assigned to Güsten locomotive shed (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw). With the delivery of 01 535 by RAW Meiningen on 31 May 1965 the Reko programme was initially declared as finished, but in fact it wasn't. For in 1968 the state and party leadership of the GDR tasked the Reichsbahn, to produce a strategic reserve of 45 Class 03 express train locomotives with an 18 ton average axle load. From 1968 to 1972, not just the required 45, but as many as 52 locomotives of this class were fitted with Reko boilers in RAW Meiningen from the largely retired Class 22 (formerly Class 39, Prussian P 10) engines. The Class 58.30 Rekolokomotives were, due to their age and the very extensive repairs and work required on the donor vehicles, the most expensive conversions of the whole programme.
The following normal gauge steam locomotive classes were reconstructed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and regrouped into a new class or sub-class:
and as individual vehicles for experimental testing and, sometimes, trials equipment platforms:
The VES-M Halle in Halle (Saale) was responsible for the reconstruction programme

1 Ilica Street ([tpl]lang-hr|Neboder u Ilici, Ilički neboder[/tpl]) is a building located in Ilica Street overlooking Ban Jelačić Square in the Lower Town area of Zagreb, Croatia. In Croatian, the building was known under the generic title Neboder (lit. Skyscraper) as it was the first business skyscraper in the country, but this use is today obsolete.
The building, designed by the trio of Slobodan Jovičić, Josip Hitil and Ivan Žuljević, was built between 1957 and 1958 and was officially inaugurated on 22 August 1959, when Većeslav Holjevac was mayor of Zagreb.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.novilist.hr/2009/09/03/kako-je-zagreb-dotaknuo-nebo.aspx | title = Kako je Zagreb dotaknuo nebo | last = Ponoš | first = Tihomir | date = 24 August 2009 | newspaper = Novi list | language = Croatian | accessdate = 9 March 2010[/tpl] It was the tallest building in Yugoslavia at the time of its completion,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zagreb.hr/default.aspx?id=16462|title=Ilički neboder|last=Milčec|first=Zvonimir|date=24 June 2009|work=ZAGrebus by Imejlčec|publisher=City of Zagreb|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 March 2010[/tpl] and it was the first building in the country which featured an aluminium façade (aluminium sheets for the building were manufactured at the Utva aircraft factory in Pančevo). Other notable high-rises built earlier in Zagreb include the nine-story modernist Löwy Building built in 1933 and the so-called Wooden Skyscraper designed by Drago Ibler - but since they were both residential buildings which resembled skyscrapers in design but not in function or size, the sixteen-story 1 Ilica Street is regarded as the first "bonafide skyscraper" built in Zagreb and Yugoslavia.
The principal investors were Končar and Ferimport, two large state-owned companies. The building later housed Ferimport offices, but it also featured an observation deck and a restaurant on its top floor (later converted into a short-lived disco club in the early 1990s) and a small shopping arcade which was built around the base of the building, connecting Ilica, Gajeva, Bogovićeva and Petrićeva streets. The observation deck was open to the public for decades, but it was fenced by security railings in 1967 after a man committed suicide by jumping off it and landing on a woman passing by, who was also killed.
On 29 November 1970 (Yugoslav Republic Day), political activists Zvonko and Julienne Bušić used the observation deck to throw leaflets advocating Croatian independence, for which they were arrested.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.matica.hr/Kolo/kolo0201.nsf/AllWebDocs/Razotkrivanja|title=Razotkrivanja|last=Sablić Tomić|first=Helena| journal = Kolo | publisher=Matica hrvatska|language=Croatian|accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl] (They later went on to hijack a TWA airliner in 1976 with the intention of convincing the international media into publishing a similar leaflet.)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zvonkobusic.com/enga1.asp|title=Julienne & Zvonko Busic - Chronology|publisher=ZvonkoBusic.com|accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl]
Ferimport later experienced a dramatic downturn in the 1990s after it was privatized in the years following Croatia's independence and the fall of communism, and the building visibly deteriorated in this period.
In 2001, three years after Ferimport had entered administration, it was sold for 6 million euros to Peter Doimi de Frankopan, a British real estate investor who claimed lineage to the House of Frankopan, a Croatian aristocratic family thought to be extinct in the 17th century. Frankopan had plans for a large scale reconstruction of the building, but the initial concept (which entailed a complete redesign of the façade and the addition of panoramic elevators, spiral staircases and a few extra floors), was rejected by the city's institute for the protection of cultural heritage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filipovic-advisory.com/datastore/newsletter/news_hr_1140193595.pdf|title=Započela obnova Iličkog nebodera|date=February 2006|work=Croatian Real Estate Newsletter|publisher=Filipović Business Advisory Ltd.|pages=4|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 March 2010[/tpl] The project was then delayed for four years until a revised renovation plan was finally approved by city authorities in December 2005.

The project was designed by the Aukett Fitzroy Robinson interior design practice in collaboration with the Zagreb-based architecture studio Proarh, and the actual work was done by the Strabag construction company.

Forty-eight children were among the dead.  The SS unit believed to be responsible for the massacre is the SS-Feldersatzbataillon 17 of 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen (Lieb, 2007).

Field theory is a psychological theory which examines patterns of interaction between the individual and the total field, or environment. The concept was developed by Kurt Lewin, a Gestalt psychologist, in the 1940s.
Field theory holds that behavior must be derived from a totality of coexisting facts. These coexisting facts make up a "dynamic field", which means that the state of any part of the field depends on every other part of it. Behavior depends on the present field rather than on the past or the future.

The wavy bars of black and gold represent the sea and the dolphin "the king of the sea", just as the lion represents "king of the beasts". The dolphin was a sign of Poole's maritime interests. The three scallop shells are the symbol of St James and associated with the shrine of Santiago de Compostela reputed burial place of St James, apostle of Jesus Christ. Santiago de Compostela was a popular destination for Christian pilgrims departing from Poole Harbour in the Middle Ages. St James is the Patron Saint of the Parish Church in Poole.
The arms were confirmed by the College of Arms on June 19, 1948, with the colours officially recorded for the first time. At the same time the crest, a mermaid supporting an anchor and holding a cannon ball was granted. The crest had in fact been in use since the 18th century.Geoffrey Briggs, Civic and Corporate Heraldry, London, 1971W. H. Fox Davies, The Book of Public Arms, 2nd edition, London, 1915 Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the 1948 arms were transferred to the present Poole Borough Council.The Local Authorities (Armorial Bearings) Order 1974 (1974 No. 869) In 1976 the borough council received the grant of supporters, the figures on either side of the shield. The supporters were a gift from Oscar Murton, the then Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons to commemorate his period of service as a Councillor and MP for Poole.
The supporters refer to Poole's main charters, to the left is a gold lion holding a long sword. This represents William Longespee, Lord of the Manor who in 1248 granted the town's first charter. The other supporter on the right is a dragon which is derived from the Royal Arms of Elizabeth I in who granted Poole county corporate status in a 1568 charter. The royal dragon is coloured red, but that granted to Poole was altered to gold for heraldic difference. The dragon holds a silver oar. This is part of the civic regalia of the Mayor of Poole, representing his additional title "Admiral of the Port of Poole". Since 1976 the dolphin has been depicted naturalistically rather than heraldically.Description of the coat of arms, Borough of Poole information sheet, undated

CATEGORIES: Organizations established in 1965, Culture of Kansas City, Missouri, Performing arts in the United States

The Harriman-Jewell Series (originally known as the "William Jewell College Fine Arts Program"), is a performing arts presentation organization founded in 1965, and based in Kansas City, Missouri.
Originally known as the "William Jewell College Fine Arts Program", it hosted Luciano Pavarotti's international recital debut on February 1, 1973. Held in William Jewell College’s John Gano Memorial Chapel, Pavarotti was perspiring due to nerves and a lingering cold. The tenor clutched a handkerchief throughout the debut, which became a signature part of his solo performances. Over the years, Pavarotti sang five recitals for the organization.
The Series has since hosted several leading tenors, including Giuseppe Filianoti (2012),Heartbreak sounds sweet when sung by Giuseppe Filianoti, Kansas City Star, April 22, 2012 Francisco Araiza (1982), Ben Heppner (1997), Marcelo Álvarez (2001), Juan Diego Flórez (2002), Daniil Shtoda (2002), Salvatore Licitra (2005), and Clifton Forbis (2006).
New York City Ballet’s Patricia McBride and Edward Villella danced in the Series’ first performance in December 1965, and violinist Itzhak Perlman played a recital in 1971.
The organisation hosts a variety of free discovery concerts, and events that allow interaction with musicians and dancers.
The organisation also makes the performing arts an integral part of the college curriculum for William Jewell College students. Among the oldest colleges west of the Mississippi River, William Jewell was named TIME Magazine's "Liberal Arts College of the Year" for 2001-2002.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
“Cezanne called the Louvre ‘the book in which we learn to read,’” said Terry Teachout, a Jewell alumnus and drama critic for the Wall Street Journal. “The Harriman program was the book in which I learned to see, hear, and love the performing arts. It gave me a golden yardstick of taste–-one I still use to this day.”[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
“No one will ever be able to calculate how the presence of some of the world’s most superb artists before area innocents influenced the development of resident music, dance and theater companies,” the Kansas City Star wrote of the Harriman-Jewell Series. “What Harriman has done...has multiplied in countless, wonderful ways.”[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

The song is adapted to a central section of Elgar's concert-overture "In the South (Alassio)" where the "Canto Popolare"The Italian "canto popolare", literally "popular song", in this context is a "folk tune", and, according to Percy Young (in Elgar, O. M.), a folk-tune invented by Elgar. melody is introduced by a solo viola with a delicate and imaginative accompaniment, which could be likened to Shelley's "...accompaniment on the Guitar."
The first performance of "In the South" was in March 1904.  In July that year Elgar made different versions of the "Canto Popolare" section. These were variously for small orchestra, for piano and for various instrumental combinations.
In August 1905 the song was reviewed in the London "Times":
The same poem was set by many others including the American composer Amy Beach ("Mrs. H. H. A. Beach"), as her Op. 1 No. 4, with the title "Ariette".

CATEGORIES: Year of birth missing (living people), Living people, CUNY Graduate Center alumni, Princeton University faculty, Yale University faculty, City University of New York faculty, University of Arizona faculty, University of Pennsylvania faculty, Vanderbilt University faculty, Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Guggenheim Fellows

Colin Dayan (also known as Joan Dayan), is the Robert Penn Warren Professor in the Humanities at Vanderbilt University, where she teaches American Studies, comparative literature, and the religious and legal history of the Americas.  She has written extensively on prison law and torture, Caribbean culture and literary history, as well as on Haitian poetics, Edgar Allan Poe, and the history of slavery. After receiving her Ph.D. from the City University of New York Graduate Center in 1980, she taught at Princeton University, Yale University, the City University of New York, the University of Arizona, and the University of Pennsylvania.
After publishing A Rainbow for the Christian West (1977), an introduction to René Depestre’s poetry and a translation of his long poem Un arc-en-ciel pour l’occident chrétien, she turned to early American literature and published Fables of Mind: An Inquiry into Poe’s Fiction (1987). Haiti, History, and the Gods (1995, 1998) reorients the study of Haitian history through what she calls “literary fieldwork.”  In the process, she recasts many boundaries: between politics and poetics, between the secular and the sacred, and between the colonizer and the colonized, those who deemed themselves masters and those who worked as slaves.The Story of Cruel and Unusual (2007), focuses on the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and traces the precedents for the torture of detainees in the “war on terror.” Her most recent book, The Law is a White Dog, How Legal Rituals Make and Unmake Persons was published by Princeton University Press in Spring 2011 and chosen by Choice as one of top-25 books for 2011.
Dayan has received an NEH fellowship (1986); a Guggenheim fellowship (2005) recognized her work on conditions of disfigured personhood and civil death that long outlive slavery itself.  She has been a fellow at the Shelby Cullom Davis Center in the Department of History and a fellow in the Program in Law and Public Affairs, both at Princeton.  Her memoirs of growing up in Atlanta, Georgia have been published in The Yale Review, Southwest Review, and The Arizona Quarterly.  A contributor to the London Review of Books and Boston Review, she writes on contemporary legal practices and the logic of punishment in supermaxes, Abu Ghraib, and Guantánamo. In 2012 she was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In mathematics, an ultralimit is a geometric construction that assigns to a sequence of metric spaces Xn a limiting metric space. The notion of an ultralimit captures the limiting behavior of finite configurations in the spaces Xn and uses an ultrafilter to avoid the process of repeatedly passing to subsequences to ensure convergence. An ultralimit is a generalization of the notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of metric spaces.

CATEGORIES: Unbuilt buildings and structures

Tour Signal was a proposed skyscraper in La Défense and in Puteaux, France.Lebow, Arthur. "The Contextualizer," New York Times. April 6, 2008, p. 4; excerpt, "...a skyscraper that Nouvel (adapting a term from the artist Brâncuși) called the “tour sans fins,” or endless tower. Conceived as a kind of minaret alongside the squat, monumental Grande Arche de La Défense, the endless tower has taken on some of the mystique of Mies van der Rohe’s unbuilt Friedrichstrasse glass skyscraper of 1921. To obscure its lower end, the tower was designed to sit within a crater. Its facade, appearing to vanish in the sky, changed as it rose, from charcoal-colored granite to paler stone, then to aluminum and finally to glass that became increasingly reflective, all to enhance the illusion of dematerialization."
Medea and Layetana were the developers with Ateliers Jean Nouvel as architects.
West Gate was chosen as the location for the building in order to open the La Défense district to the municipality of Puteaux. The project’s ambition was to create a stronger polarity at the heart of the Île-de-France and develop a major attraction while relating the project to its natural and built environment and, lastly, embodying the various elements which strengthen the feeling that the project belongs in the district.
This project has been cancelled. In 2009, Medea and Layetana announced they are not involved in the project anymore, and the new president of the EPAD Joëlle Ceccaldi-Raynaud declared her opposition to the tower which looks like an unaesthetic "monolith".

Though group singing, especially in harmony, is not part of the Irish music tradition, The Voice Squad have a considerable repertoire of Irish traditional songs and have always sung unaccompanied.
 
 'Many's The Foolish Youth, first issued in 1987, was the first record by Fran, Gerry and Phil. Later they became known as The Voice Squad. Their style of singing in harmony does not form part of the Irish singing tradition, but each of the singers had already served his time in our individual tradition before coming together to sing in harmony.' - Frank HarteSleevenotes to 'Many's the Foolish Youth
They have been compared to English family groups of similar style, such as 'The Watersons' and 'The Copper Family'. 'It is the union of the distinct tenor voices of Fran and Phil plus the bass of Gerry, along with their own particular arrangements of good songs, that has made them one of the most distinctive unaccompanied singing groups of recent times.'http://www.taramusic.ie/biogs/vsquad.htm

Broken Embraces ([tpl]lang-es|link=no|Los abrazos rotos|links=no[/tpl]) is a 2009 Spanish romantic thriller film written, produced, and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0913425/|title=Broken Embraces (2009) |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=11 February 2011[/tpl] Led by an ensemble cast consisting of many Almodóvar regulars, it stars Lluís Homar as a blind Madrilenian screenwriter who recalls his tragic love for Lena, played by Penélope Cruz, the deceased lead actress in his last directional feature Girls and Suitcases, who was also the mistress of a powerful, obsessive businessman (José Luis Gómez). Blanca Portillo co-stars as his agent Judit, while Tamar Novas portrays her son and Caine's co-writer Diego.
Inspired by darkness and by a photo of a couple, that Almodóvar took of El Golfo beach in Lanzarote in the late 1990s, the film serves as an homage to filmmaking, cinema and its various film genres. Stylistically, it is a complex noir-ish melodrama, that also blends comic elements with a film within a film—a broad comedy, that hearkens back to Almodóvar's 1988 release, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. Thematically, Broken Embraces addresses themes like voyeurism, repression, prostitution, death, vengeance, fixation, illness, and drugs.

CATEGORIES: 1986 songs, Eurovision songs of 1986, Eurovision songs of Switzerland, French-language songs, Songs written by Nella Martinetti

"Pas pour moi" ("Not for me") was the Swiss entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest 1986 in Bergen, Norway. It was sung by Daniela Simmons and performed in French.
On the night of the final, the song performed in the tenth position (following Spain's Cadillac singing "Valentino" and preceding Israel's Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel with "Yavo Yom"), and at the close of the voting had received 140 points, placing 2nd in a field of 20.
In the song, Simmons sings about how she desires "love written in capital letters" from a man, and laments as to why this is not happening for her. She decries one-night stands and men treating women as if they are only "tricks coming from the disco," which caused a minor stir in French-speaking nations as Simmons uses mildly vulgar contemporary slang to describe such acts. The "pas pour moi" referenced in the song is Simmons telling the listener that she feels young people living a hedonistic existence with many sexual partners is "not for her." Throughout most of the song, Simmons plays the underlying melody herself on the piano.
It was succeeded as Swiss representative at the 1987 contest by Carol Rich with "Moitié, moitié".

CJC-1295 is a tetrasubstituted 30-amino acid peptide hormone, primarily functioning as a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analog. It was invented by ConjuChem, a Canadian biotechnology company.
One of the advantages of CJC-1295 over traditional GHRH or rHGH is its ability to bioconjugate with serum albumin, thus increasing its half-life and therapeutic window. It accomplishes this by using protecting groups around the amino acids of GHRH typically susceptible to enzymatic degradation.[tpl]cite web|last=Teichman|first=Sam|title=Prolonged Stimulation of Growth Hormone (GH) and Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Secretion by CJC-1295, a Long-Acting Analog of GH-Releasing Hormone, in Healthy Adults|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/91/3/799.full|publisher=JCEM|accessdate=27 September 2013[/tpl]

Monticello is a reservoir in the U.S. state of South Carolina, built to provide water for the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station.[ref]Lake Monticello Reservoir
 - South Carolina Department of Parks & Tourism</ref> It is located in [[Jenkinsville, South Carolina|Jenkinsville]].  While it does not dam any major rivers, its outflow flows directly into [[Parr Reservoir]], an artificial lake created along the [[Broad River (Carolinas)|Broad River]], via the Fairfield Pumped Storage power station.
The lake is mainly used to cool the turbines of a nearby nuclear power plant. It is famous locally for its catfishing, as some 60 lb. and up fish have been pulled from its waters.
Fluctuations in the level of the reservoir are thought to have increased the incidence of induced seismicity in the area.[tpl]cite journal|last=Talwani|first=P.|year=1997|title=On the Nature of Reservoir-induced Seismicity|journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics|volume=150|issue=3-4|pages=473–492|issn=0033-4553|doi=10.1007/s000240050089[/tpl]
The referenced study by Talwani 2 actually states that after an initial increase, levels of seismicity at Monticello have returned to pre-reservoir levels. Therefore induced seismicity is linked with the initial impoundment, and is not an ongoing issue at this location.

The school was established in 1783, and the museum itself in 1794 under René Just Haüy as a Cabinet of Mineralogy "containing all production in the world and all productions of the Republic, arranged by locality." It was quickly augmented by private collections, sometimes seized by the state. Many fine additions were made in short order, and by 1814 the museum contained about 100,000 samples at the Hotel de Mouchy. During the 19th century and early 20th century it continued to acquire excellent collections from around the world, interrupted for several decades by World War II, but then resuming. 
Today the museum is stated to be one of the ten largest mineral collections in the world, containing some 100,000 samples including 80,000 minerals, 15,000 rocks, 4,000 ores, 400 meteorites, 700 gems, and 300 artificial minerals.

Percival Goodhouse (c. 1752 - August 2, 1774) was one of the first patients admitted to the Public Hospital for Persons of Insane and Disordered Minds in Williamsburg, Virginia, after its opening on October 12, 1773.  A paranoid schizophrenic, Goodhouse escaped the asylum shortly after his admittance and fled to the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg.http://www.dogstreetjournal.com/story/871  He was found in the Palace's garden maze, clutching a large knife.  Goodhouse was tried and convicted of treason for attempting to assassinate the governor (John Murray, Lord Dunmore) and was hanged on August 2, 1774.  His body was left to rot in a field just beyond the old College campus.  Students often uncovered his remains as a prank.
Several instances of supposed ghost sightings in the garden maze have been attributed to Goodhouse.  One account describes the encounter of a student from the College of William & Mary with a pair of "milky, white, transparent" feet which disappeared upon closer examination.  Another story, concerning the murder of a female student in the 1960s, has sometimes been mistakenly associated with Goodhouse.

CATEGORIES: Protected areas of Newberry County, South Carolina, Protected areas of Fairfield County, South Carolina, Reservoirs in South Carolina

Parr Reservoir or Parr Shoals Reservoir is an impoundment of the Broad River in Peak, South Carolina.  It is the last dam on the Broad River before the river reaches Columbia, South Carolina and the Columbia Canal. The lake is mainly used as a holding pond of sorts, as the water is pulled in and out and used to cool the turbines of a nearby nuclear power plant. Some anglers will fish for catfish in the main river channel, while bass fishing is mainly held back to Heller's and Cannon creeks, as well as the tailrace below Lake Monticello. Because of fluctuating water levels, and millions of submerged trees lurking underneath the shallow water, it is an extremely dangerous body of water to fish.[tpl]cn|date=June 2012[/tpl]

Pandurang Sadashiv Khankhoje (7 November 1884 – 22 January 1967) was an Indian revolutionary, scholar, agricultural scientist and historian who was among the founding fathers of the Ghadar Party.
Khankhoje was born in November 1884  to a Marathi Brahmin family at Wardha, where his father worked as a petition-writer. Young Khankhoje spent his childhood in Wardha, where he completed his primary and middle school education before moving to Nagpur for higher education. He was at the time inspired by the nationalist work of Bal Gangadhar Tilak. At some time in the first decade of 1900s, Khankhoje left India on a voyage that ultimately saw him settle in the United States. Here he enrolled in the Oregon Agricultural College (now called Oregon State University), graduating in 1911. His earliest nationalist work abroad dates back to the time around 1908 when he, along with Pandit Kanshi Ram founded the Indian Independence League in Portland, Oregon. His works also brought him close to other Indian nationalists in United States at the time, including Taraknath Das. In the years preceding World War I, Khankhoje was one of the founding members of the Pacific coast Hindustan association, and subsequently founded the Ghadar Party. He was at the time one of the most influential members of the party. He met Lala Har Dayal in 1911. He also enrolled at one point in a West Coast military academy. 
Through World War I, Khankhoje was intricately involved in the Hindu-German Conspiracy when he was involved in the plans for the mutiny. He had joined a western He visited Europe during the war and subsequently went to Mesopotamia along with other members of what was the Berlin Committee. In the summer of 1915, he worked clandestinely among roops of the Indian expeditionary force, spreading nationalist literature and hoping to incite a mutiny. Through the course of the war, Khankhoje made his way through Turkey and Persia under different Muslim guises as far as Baluchistan, spreading Ghadarite propaganda en route. He is known to have attempted insurrections and raised at the Iran-Baluchistan border while Mahendra Pratap's Indo-German expedition attempted to rally the Afghan Emir Habibullah Khan against British India. Towards the end of the war, Khankhoje, like most of the members of the Berlin committee, began turing towards communism. He is known to have been in Soviet Union in company of the earliest Indian communist, including Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, M. P. T. Acharya, M. N. Roy, Abdur Rab Barq. He met Lenin at Moscow in 1921. For his nationalist work at the time, Khankoje was banned from returning to India as a highly dangerous individual. 
Khankhoje later moved to Mexico in the 1920s, where he was instated the professor of Botany and Crop Breeding in the National School of Agriculture in Mexico. In 1936, Khankhoje married Jean Alexandrine Sindic, a Belgian women in Mexico by whom he had two daughters. He led the Mexican corn breeding program and was appointed director to the Mexican Government's department of Agriculture. Both Pandurang and Jean returned to India after 1947. His application for visa was initially rejected by the Indian government due to the ban by the British Indian Government, but was eventually overturned. He settled in Nagpur and subsequently embarked on a political career. Pandurang Khankhoje died on January 22, 1967.

[[Marker vaccine]]
CATEGORIES: Animal disease control, Vaccination

A marker vaccine is a  vaccine which allows for the differentiation between infected and vaccinated subjects.  Most vaccines are inactivated or attenuated forms of the targeted virus, therefore it is impossible to differentiate by laboratory tests which subjects are infected or only vaccinated.  Marker vaccines, being a form of the virus without a particular gene coding for a non protective antigen so, do not produce a key antibody, while still protecting against the disease.  Laboratory tests can test for the absence of the antibody, confirming whether the individual has vaccinated or is genuinely infected and needs treatment.

Bonde grew up in Storängen, Nacka, Sweden, and lives currently in Stockholm.  He has an older brother and sister.
Bonde got his first drum kit at age 12 after being fascinated by the drumming during a live band performance at a student party for his sister. Signed up for lessons by his mother, he found that practicing drum rudiments took the fun out of it, and after one lesson went back to learning on his own.  He tried to model his playing after that of drummers he admired, particularly Nirvana's Dave Grohl and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Chad Smith.[tpl]cite news | first=Gustav | last=Linder | coauthors= | title=Johnossi | date=2006-02-21 | publisher= | url =http://www.drummersdigest.com/live/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=140&Itemid=45 | work =Drummer's Digest | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-30 | language = Swedish [/tpl]

The Iraqi presidential election of 1995 took place on October 15 of that year. It was the first direct presidential election under the rule of Saddam Hussein, who had seized power through the Revolutionary Command Council in 1979. Taking the form of a referendum with no other candidates, the election involved giving voters paper ballots that said: "Do you approve of President Saddam Hussein being the President of the Republic?"Nohlen, Dieter; Grotz, Florian; Hartmann, Christof (eds.).

William Chesney "Chez" Reavie (born November 12, 1981) is an American professional golfer. 
Reavie was born in Wichita, Kansas. He played college golf at Arizona State University.
Reavie was a rookie member of the PGA Tour in 2008. He finished 18th on the money list on the Nationwide Tour in 2007 to earn his card. He played on the Nationwide Tour from 2005 through 2007. On July 27, 2008, Reavie won the 2008 RBC Canadian Open. The win, his first on the PGA Tour, earned him $900,000 and a two-year exemption to remain on the Tour. Knee surgery limited Reavie in 2010 and he began the 2011 season on a major medical exemption where he had thirteen events to keep his Tour Card. Reavie did not earn enough to retain full tour privileges, but by merely making the cut at the 2011 Memorial Tournament (the final start of his exemption), he earned conditional status for the rest of 2011. Reavie still managed to play in 22 events, making 15 cuts, and placing high enough to earn a spot in the FedEx Cup playoffs. His earnings of over one million dollars prior to the FedEx Cup secured his 2012 Tour Card. He nearly won his first event in over three years at the 2011 Deutsche Bank Championship, but had problems on the 18th hole before losing to Webb Simpson on the second playoff hole. He would finish 10th in the FedEx Cup, 34th on the money list with $2,285,067, and an OWGR rank of 67th after ending 2010 762nd in the world.
After a mediocre 2012 saw Reavie finish 135th on the money list, he went back to Q School to regain his Tour card. He finished T22 and is one of the last players and last former PGA Tour winner to earn a Tour card through Q School.

Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado (1530–1593) was a Spanish captain who was one of the more successful soldiers in the Arauco War in Chile rising to the rank of Maestre de Campo and temporary Capitán General of the Captaincy General of Chile.
Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado was born in Cantalapiedra, Salamanca in 1530.  He was the son of Francisco Martinez Nieto and Ana Bernal del Mercado. He traveled to the Americas in 1541 with  the expedition of Blasco Nuñez de Vela, recently named Viceroy of Peru.  From Peru, he went to Bolivia where he had some success.  In 1549, he joined with Pedro de Valdivia coming to Chile from the valley of Potosí, Valdivia gave him an encomienda in the area of the present Valdivia, naming him temporary captain of the new city.  The death of Valdivia at the hands of Lautaro made so deep an impression on him that he left his encomienda and served under Francisco de Villagra in the war.  Bernal del Mercado showed intelligence, bravery and an energetic character.  He also had a deep and lasting hatred towards the Mapuche.
The defense of the fort of Los Infantes was in his charge and he served under governor Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza and Pedro de Villagra and the government of the Real Audiencia.  In 1564, he defeated and killed the toqui Illangulién in the Battle of Angol.  He gained a good reputation from his successes in the War of Arauco, and for that reason was appointed Maestro de Campo and in addition corregidor of Concepción in 1565 and of Santiago in 1583. In 1570, he was named  to carry out the war as temporary Capitán General after the governor Melchor Bravo de Saravia resigned the post and appointed him in his place.  The experience and prestige that he accumulated was immense and had all the merit to be named as Royal Governor of Chile, but his hard and undiplomatic character worked against him.  He remained as Maestro de Campo until 1583, and was soon after named Captain of the line of defense. Sometimes he acted as an advisor to the king providing to him with detailed information on the state of the war. He died in Angol in 1593, without becoming Governor.

[[Tatyana Sukhotina-Tolstaya]]

CATEGORIES: 1864 births, 1950 deaths, Russian nobility, Tolstoy family, Leo Tolstoy

Countess Tatyana Lvovna Sukhotina-Tolstaya (or Tatiana Sukhotin-Tolstoy; [tpl]lang-ru|Графиня Татья́на Льво́вна Сухо́тина-Толста́я[/tpl], born Tatyana Lvovna Tolstaya (October 4, 1864 – September 21, 1950), was the oldest daughter of the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy.
Tatyana (known in her family as Tanya) grew up close to both her mother and father. She early demonstrated a love of painting, and in 1881 she entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where her teachers were Vasily Perov, Illarion Pryanishnikov, and Leonid Pasternak; she also studied with Nikolai Ge.
Devoted to her father and his ideals, she had rejected a number of suitors, but in 1897 she fell seriously in love with Mikhail Sergeevich Sukhotin, who was in his fifties and married, with six children. Tanya carried on a kind of platonic romance with him, met him secretly, suffered from the falseness of the situation but could not bring herself to break it off. "I am ashamed when I think of Sukhotin's wife and children," she wrote, "although he assured me that I am depriving them of nothing and although I know his wife stopped loving him long ago. And also, "Papa is the great rival of all lovers and none has been able to vanquish him yet. But this love of mine is competing more strongly than any other has done so far."Henri Troyat, Tolstoy, New York: Doubleday, 1967, p. 551 Sukhotin's wife died later that year, and on October 9, Tanya announced her desire to marry Sukhotin to her father, who responded with a fiercely uncompromising rejection ("But why a pure girl should want to get mixed up in such a business is beyond me"). Tanya gave in for the time being, but finally insisted, and on November 14, 1899 the couple were married, with Tolstoy sobbing as he led his daughter to the church. They lived on Sukhotin's estate, Kochety ("The Roosters," in Tula guberniya, about [tpl]Convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Orel), and on November 19, 1905 she gave birth to her only child, a daughter also called Tatyana (Tanya).
From 1914 to 1921 she lived in Yasnaya Polyana, where from 1917 to 1923 she was guardian of the museum; from 1923 to 1925 she was director of the Tolstoy Museum in Moscow. In 1925, together with her daughter, she emigrated to Paris, where she was hostess to Bunin, Chaliapin, Stravinsky, Alexandre Benois, and other members of the Russian exile community.  From Paris she moved to Italy, where she spent her final years.
In her diary (Dec. 13, 1932) she wrote: "I have lived an incredibly and undeservedly happy and interesting life. And successful."
Her diary (maintained from October 1878 until 1932) was published in English (The Tolstoy Home: Diaries of Tatiana Sukhotin-Tolstoy, tr. Alec Brown, London: Harvill Press; New York: Columbia University Press, 1951) and French (Tatiana Tolstoi, Journal, tr. André Maurois, Paris: Plon, 1953), but in Russian (aside from excerpts in Novy Mir in 1973) not until Т. Л. Сухотина-Толстая, Воспоминания Memoirs, Moscow: Khudozhestvennaya literatura, 1976.

[[Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy (film)]]

Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy ([tpl]zh|c=智取威虎山|p=zhì qǔ wēihǔ shān[/tpl]) is a Chinese film from 1970, during the height of the Cultural Revolution.  The film was directed by Xie Tieli and was based on a contemporary Beijing opera, one of the eight model plays allowed during the Cultural Revolution. The story is based on the novel Lin hai xue yuan (林海雪原) and tells the story of an incident in 1946, during the Chinese Civil War. 
Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy has been identified as one of the most watched films of all time. Official Chinese government statistics claimed a total audience of 7.3 billion through the end of 1974.[tpl]cite book |title=Chinese Cinema: Culture and Politics Since 1949 |last=Clark |first=Paul |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-32638-9 |page=145 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jzQ9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA145&dq=%22taking+tiger+mountain+by+strategy%22+billion&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22taking%20tiger%20mountain%20by%20strategy%22%20billion&f=false |accessdate=2010-01-19[/tpl] The large audience can be attributed to the fact that few films were produced during the Cultural Revolution, and almost all earlier films were banned; nevertheless, the average village held ten film showings per year, and failure to attend could have been seen as a sign of political deviation. Hence, Chinese citizens would have been expected to see the film multiple times during the Cultural Revolution era.[tpl]cite book |title=Film Facts |last=Robertson |first=Patrick |year=2001 |publisher=Aurum Press |location=London |isbn=1-85410-654-6 |page=229[/tpl]

[[Marcel Wittrisch]]

CATEGORIES: 1901 births, 1955 deaths, German opera singers, Operatic tenors

Marcel Wittrisch (1 October 1901 – 3 June 1955) was a popular German operatic tenor.
Wittrisch was born in Antwerp, Belgium to a German family, and subsequently studied in Munich, Leipzig, and Milan. His career began in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt in 1925 in a production of Hans Heiling by Marschner at the Halle Opera House. He then went to Brunswick and on to Berlin, where he sang opera from 1929 to 1944. Wittrisch also appeared as Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus at the Royal Opera House, London in 1931.
The fact that Wittisch was able to carve out a fine career in the face of competition from such renowned German tenor rivals as Richard Tauber, Helge Roswaenge, Franz Völker, Julius Patzak, and Peter Anders, among others, testifies to his talent.
Wittrisch's singing in its prime period during the 1930s was characterised by a fresh, gleaming tone and easy top notes. As his voice matured, he undertook heavier operatic roles such as Wagner's Lohengrin in 1937 at the Bayreuth Festival and eventually Siegmund and Parsifal after the Second World War. He died in  Stuttgart, aged 53.

The Van de Kamp Bakery Building was built in 1930 in the Glassell Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. It served as the headquarters of the chain of bakeries and coffee shops known for their distinctive windmill architecture. The building was designed by New York architect J. Edward Hopkins to resemble a Dutch 16th century farmhouse.http://www.dmjmhn.aecom.com/NewsMedia/45/55/index.jsp Originally there was a Van de Kamp's store next to the building, which was one of the first Van de Kamp's stores ever made and had the famous Van de Kamp's windmill style design. The building remains the only example of an industrial plant in the Dutch Renaissance Revival style. The bakery closed in October 1990 after Van de Kamps filed for Chapter 11.http://www.laweekly.com/1999-10-28/news/history-in-the-baking/ The building is a designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, declared on May 12, 1992.

[[Sociology of film]]
CATEGORIES: Subfields of sociology, Film

The sociology of film can be clearly seen within the spanning genres of film since the creation of film. The genres span from Gangster films to Musicals that all have sociological aspects embedded in the course of the films. Every screenwriter has always tried to figure out what sociological aspects should be incorporated in a film so that they can reach out to a wide audience within the two hours in which their film is presented.
"One problem, though, is that if the audience is the measure all things, then art becomes a reflection of sociology and dissecting audience tastes becomes the art."Edward Rothstein. Is the Audience Being Rowdy?. New York Times. New York, N.Y.: May 27, 2000. pg. B.11f
"Somehow, although our poets have not yet defined it for us, a corporation lives a life and finds a fate outside the lives and fates of its human constituents." Tino Balio, The American Film Industry. The Fortune. 1976. Pg. 263. The sociology of a film is created off of people and their situations that comes to a screen writer who then decides to make the film into a motion picture with the use of those actors and actresses that become the famous socialites of the film.
Since the creation of film, there are six main genres that comprise the film industry. These six genres are: Gangster, Hard Boiled Detective, Western, Screwball Comedy, The Musical and The Family Melodrama. Thomas Schatz, Hollywood Genres. Random House. 1981.

Local government in New Jersey is more complex than in most U.S. states, potentially leading to misunderstandings regarding the governmental nature of an area. With five types and twelve forms of local government (plus several non-standard forms in municipalities with special charters), some areas of New Jersey are administered significantly differently from other states.  All of New Jersey is included in one of the state's 21 counties and part of the state's 565 municipalities. That means there are no independent cities or consolidated city-counties in New Jersey.

Nonja, whose name meant "girl" in Malaysian, was captured in the wild and brought to the Wassenaar Zoo in the Netherlands in 1955. She was thought to be about 2-3 years old at the time. She was transferred to the Miami MetroZoo (now Zoo Miami) on October 4, 1983, where she spent the rest of her life. Nonja gave birth to five offspring.
Nonja died at the Miami MetroZoo on Saturday, December 29, 2007. Experts believe that she died of either a brain tumor or an aneurysm. She was 55 years old when she died. Most orangutans die before they reach their mid-40s, which made Nonja unique and likely the oldest living orangutan in the world at the time.

For example, the great majority of pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.
Historically, the term hermaphrodite has also been used to describe ambiguous genitalia and gonadal mosaicism in individuals of gonochoristic species, especially human beings. The word intersex has come into preferred usage for humans, since the word hermaphrodite is considered to be misleading and stigmatizing,[tpl]cite web|title=Is a person who is intersex a hermaphrodite?|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=2 October 2011[/tpl] as well as "scientifically specious and clinically problematic".[tpl]cite web|last=Herndon|first=April|title=Getting Rid of "Hermaphroditism" Once and For All|url=http://www.isna.org/node/979|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=2 October 2011[/tpl]

[[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)]]
CATEGORIES: Leadership training of the Boy Scouts of America

Wood Badge is the highest level of adult Scout leader training available. It was first presented in England by the founder of Scouting, Baden Powell, and he introduced the program into the United States during a visit in 1936. The first course was held at the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation, but Americans did not fully adopt Wood Badge until 1948. The National BSA Council staff provided direct leadership to the program through 1958, when the increased demand encouraged them to permit local councils to deliver the training.
The program originally focused almost exclusively on Scoutcraft skills, some elements of the Patrol Method, and First Class Boy Scout requirements. In a major cultural shift during the 1970s, Wood Badge was modified to train Scouters in eleven specific leadership competencies. The National Council has updated it several times since then, and during 2001–2002 implemented an overhaul that emphasized a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership and problem-solving skills. The training is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and a short outdoor camping experience. It is a key element of the overall leadership training program.

USS ''Plumas County'' (LST-1083) was an LST-542-class tank landing ship in the United States Navy. Unlike many of her class, which received only numbers and were disposed of after World War II, she survived long enough to be named. On 1 July 1955, all LSTs still in commission were named for US counties or parishes; LST-1083 was given the name Plumas County, after Plumas County, California.
She was built in Ambridge, Pennsylvania by the American Bridge Company, and was launched on 14 January 1945. She  passed through the Panama Canal and saw combat action at Midway, Wake Island, the Marshall Islands, Guam, Saipan, the Mariana Islands, Leyte in the Philippines, and Okinawa. 
She was the first LST to drop anchor in Japanese waters after the atom bomb was dropped, and was present at the signing of the Japanese surrender.
She returned to San Francisco after the war, and was decommissioned in August 1946. She was recommissioned on 8 September 1950 and served in the Korean War, finally returning to California in July 1954.  She was named Plumas County on 1 July 1955 and spent the rest of her career operating off California, and in the Pacific, carrying out joint amphibious exercises with Nationalist China and South Korea.  She was placed in reserve at Sasebo on 22 August 1961, and was transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service in December 1965.
Plumas County earned one battle star during World War II and three battle stars during the Korean War.

Achnatherum speciosum is a species of grass known by the common name desert needlegrass. It is native to much of the south-western United States from California to Colorado, where it grows in dry areas, especially sagebrush habitat. It is also known from Mexico and parts of South America. 
This is a short perennial bunchgrass reaching a maximum height of 1–2 ft. The leaf blades are less than a millimeter wide and rolled along the edges. The bases are stiff and remain as the dense grass clump dries. The inflorescence is up to about 2 inches long and is dense and fluffy. Each spikelet is very hairy and has a bent awn up to about a centimeter long which is coated in long hairs.
The stiff awn and the sharp tip of the spikelet make the seeds hazardous for animals. The hairs on the seed help in catch in animal coats and drift on the wind for dispersal. The awn also twists when wet, helping the seed bury itself in the soil.

[[Bottom 10]]
CATEGORIES: College football rankings

The Bottom 10 (officially, ESPN.com's Bottom 10) is a week-by-week regular season "ranking" of the worst ten college football teams in the NCAA Division I FBS.NT Daily News[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl] "NT among league's worst" by Michael Neglia, September 8, 2006  ESPN.con writer Mark Schlabach writes the column each week and is the sole determiner of the teams which are listed.
One of the running gags of the Bottom 10 is the "highly coveted Number 5 spot".  This spot is reserved for "the top BCS blunder of the week" – a normally strong football team which found itself on the wrong end of an upset the prior week; an example would be the September 7, 2011 Bottom 10, which featured Oregon State at the #5 ranking after its upset loss to Sacramento State, a Division I FCS program that had previously never beaten an FBS team in its history.http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/page/bottom10110907/looking-local-ymca-reinforcements-bottom-10
Another notable running gag is that the rankings sometimes include, not teams, but other items associated with the team; the September 7 Bottom 10 (referenced above) included such items as "bad weather" (a reference to three games, including the South Florida upset of Notre Dame, being delayed or prematurely shortened by severe weather), "TCU's defense" (a reference to TCU, ranked #14 in the AP poll, giving up 50 points in its loss to unranked Baylor), and "F_U" — where the underscore acts as a wildcard to imply the two schools FIU and FAU.

[[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Szymanowski)]]
CATEGORIES: Violin concertos, Compositions by Karol Szymanowski, 1916 compositions

Karol Szymanowski’s Violin Concerto No. 1, Op. 35, is considered one of the first modern violin concertos. It rejects traditional tonality and romantic aesthetics.
It was written in 1916 while the composer was in Zarudzie, Ukraine. Paul Kochanski advised Szymanowski on the fine point of violin technique during the composition of the concerto, and he later wrote the cadenza. The work is dedicated to Kochański. The likely inspiration for the concerto was Noc Majowa, a poem by the Polish poet Tadeusz Miciński. The concerto doesn't follow or duplicate the poem, yet Szymanowski's ecstatic, sumptuous music is an ideal companion to Miciński's language: 
All the birds pay tribute to me 
for today I wed a goddess.
And now we stand by the lake in crimson blossom
in flowing tears of joy, with rapture and fear,
burning in amorous conflagration."
|}
The Violin Concerto No. 1 was premiered 1 November 1922 in Warsaw with Józef Ozimiński as the soloist.

Magic Youth International (M.Y.I.) was the highly respected junior branch of the International Brotherhood of Magicians (I.B.M.). The global membership of the I.B.M. actively supported this dynamic youth-focused program to promote, educate and enhance the activities of young magicians around the world. 
Magic Youth International was originally founded in 1955 by Robert J. Watson and Keith Halbasch, two Chicago teenage magicians. As a correspondence club, teen members shared their magic-related ideas, skills and experiences through personal letters. The letters were compiled into a simple newsletter called PIPS. 
With college looming in 1959, Robert and Keith released full control of the club to their adult adviser and magic peer Jess James. Under Mr. James' management, the club spread to cities across the Midwest United States.
In 1963, Dale Salwak organized a competing Indiana-based teen magic correspondence club called The Magic Club of America (M.C.A.). Fellow Hoosiers, Steve Kelley and Greg Heeter formed a cooperative club called The International Club of Magic (I.C.M.) featuring their teen magic journal Top Hat. 
The three clubs merged in 1966 under Mr. James' Magic Youth International banner retaining the popular Top Hat as the official club journal. This merger made Magic Youth International the third largest magic club in the United States behind The International Brotherhood of Magicians and the Society of American Magicians (S.A.M.).
The I.B.M. created a youth membership in 1994. International President John R. Brown III and Youth Committee chairman Steve Burton led the adoption of Magic Youth International as the official I.B.M. youth branch in 1998. 
The I.B.M. executive board reorganized and rebranded M.Y.I. as I.B.M. Youth in 2012. This stellar program continues to serve as an educational and social network for magicians and magic enthusiasts between the ages of 7 through 17 years.  I.B.M. Youth has chapters around the world generally affiliated with adult I.B.M chapters (called Rings).
When a member turns 18, he or she graduates to full membership in the International Brotherhood of Magicians.

The success of "Noor" for MBC has sparked a boom in dubbed Turkish dramas across many leading Arab sat-casters. MBC even launched a pay TV channel in partnership with pay TV platform Showtime Arabia entirely dedicated to "Noor" that allows viewers to watch episodes of the sudser around the clock.
The dizzying pop-cultural phenomenon surrounding the series has encouraged the broadcaster further to make a film out of the Turkish soap. The feature version, which MBC will co-produce with Turkish shingle Momentum Prods., will have a budget in the $2.5 million-3.5 million range and will also be shot in Turkish before being dubbed into Arabic. The project will reunite Turkish thespians Kıvanç Tatlıtuğ and Songül Öden, who captured the hearts of Arab audiences in their husband-and-wife roles of Muhannad and Noor, respectively.
The series has also been shown in Iran  and the show dubbed into Persian with the title "Nur" ("Brightness").
The series has also been shown in Romania on Kanal D Romania with the title "Iubire de Argint" ("Love of Silver"). The Bulgarian private TV channel bTV currently airing the show dubbed into Bulgarian with the title "Перла" ("Pearl").

Ways and Means is a short comic play by Noël Coward, one of ten that make up Tonight at 8:30, a cycle written to be performed across three evenings. The story concerns an heiress and her gambling husband, who are plagued by debt and embarrassment as everything seems to always go wrong for them. Their honour is saved just in time when a disgraced chauffeur tries to rob them but amiably ends up pulling them out of a hole.
In the introduction to a published edition of the plays, Coward wrote, "A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions."Shaw Festival Study Guide, 2009, p. 4. Accessed 17 March 2010.
The play was first produced in London (1936), then in New York (1936–1937) and Canada (1938). It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for film.

It is two-lane per direction all through Cataño and a vast area of Bayamón, and becomes rural a couple of kilometers before entering through Naranjito. During the rainy season this road is risky as there is chance of rock fall and debris onto the road. This happens mainly due to increase in moisture content in the soil, which loosens the suspending rocks adjacent to the highway. It is proposed to make this road fully parallel to the future tollway PR-5, which will be extended until Comerío. The future tollway will pass through the only cable-suspended bridge in the island in Bayamón near the border with Naranjito.

Son of colonel Francisco de Albear y Hernández, governor of the Morro Castle of Havana he was sent to study in mainland Spain and graduated in 1839 from the Military Engineering School of Guadalajara, Spain, with the rank of lieutenant. He was assigned to the Corps of Engineers of Cuba in 1845. Eventually he reached the rank of Brigadier General of the Royal Corps of Engineers, being in charge of over 182 projects in Cuba.

[[Puerto Rico Highway 185]]

CATEGORIES: Highways in Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico Highway 185 is a main highway that connects Canóvanas, Puerto Rico to Juncos, Puerto Rico and is about 25 kilometers long. It begins in downtown of Canóvanas, very close to Puerto Rico Highway 3 and ends in Puerto Rico Highway 952 and Puerto Rico Highway 30 in Juncos. For people coming from/going to Caguas, the highway has a direct intersection with PR-30; for those coming from/going to Humacao, drivers have to take short highway PR-952 and then take PR-189 just before its intersection with PR-30, hence this exit being one of the most disorganized junctions in the island between a main highway and a main freeway or tollway in the island. New Puerto Rico Highway 66 also has a poor-designed intersection with the highway, since it only allow people going to/coming from Carolina (west) and not the east. This is probably because the short segment open from the new tollway immediately ends at PR-3 only 2 kilometers from the exit to PR-185 and thus expected to be fixed when the segment to Rio Grande opens to the public.
The highway enters a small portion of Carolina, before it enters Canóvanas. PR-185 serves as an alternate route for people who drive the way between the metro area and the southeast, and it does not climb many hills and is generally wide. It is a much better option than taking Puerto Rico Highway 181 or going to Fajardo and then go south via PR-53, since the island is wider in the north than in the south segment.

[[Tramlining]]
CATEGORIES: Driving, Road construction

Tramlining is the tendency of a vehicle's wheels to follow the contours in the surface upon which it runs. The term comes from the tendency of a car's wheels to follow the normally recessed rails of street trams, without driver input in the same way that the train does.  The same effect is sometimes called Nibbling.
Tramlining can usually be blamed on tires, and its incidence depends greatly on the model of tire and its state of wear. Although not normally dangerous, at very high speeds it can become a source of instability.
Vehicles with large and wide low profile tires are more prone to the effects as well as vehicles which have wheels fitted that are larger than the manufacturers recommendation or have reinforced sidewalls. People who are relatively inexperienced with driving with this tendency will feel that they have to make continual course corrections and it is very easy to overcompensate the steering, which could potentially lead to veering off the road especially if the road is a narrow track/country road.
The effects of tramlining can be eased by subjecting the vehicle to an inspection and calibration of the wheels (i.e. a full geometry check) or replacing the tires with non-reinforced (soft sidewall) tires.

This cartoon short is directed by Phil Monroe and co-directed by Maurice Noble, with a story by John Dunn. That was the last Warner Bros. theatrical cartoon featuring Bugs and Daffy together until Box Office Bunny in 1990, and the last that Chuck Jones worked on, though he was fired at an early stage of production and replaced by Monroe (by the time it was released, Jones had already produced two cartoons at his new studio, Sib-Tower 12).
The roaring of the angry bears in the cartoon seems to be the same sound effect used for the monster's roar in the feature film The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, which was also produced by Warner Bros.

The demographics of South Africa have uncommon profile, marked by a heterogeneous population base, social issues brought on by the legacy of apartheid, divisions within ethnic groups, HIV/AIDS and emigration.  The Rainbow Nation demography consequently plays a prominent role in public policy.
Blacks compose about 79.6% (2007 est.) of the population and represent different ethnic groups, including Zulu, Xhosa, Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho and Swazi, as well as recent immigrants from other parts of Africa (particularly Zimbabwe and Nigeria).  Whites compose 9.1% (2007 est), being the descendants of Dutch, French, British, and German settlers who began arriving at the Cape from the late 17th century, immigrants from Europe who arrived in South Africa in the twentieth century, and Portuguese who left the former Portuguese colonies of southern Africa (Angola and Mozambique) after their independence in the mid-1970s.  Coloureds (8.8%, 2007 est) are mixed-race people primarily descended from the earliest settlers, their slaves, and the indigenous peoples.  The remaining 2.4% are categorised as 'Indian/Asian', including the descendants of Indian indentured sugar estate workers and traders who came to South Africa in the mid-19th (particularly around Natal), as well as a few Chinese South Africans, approximately 100,000 people.South Africa Mid-year population estimates, South Africa: 2007 http://www.statssa.gov.za/PublicationsHTML/P03022007/html/P03022007.html

His skill with carving deadwood quickly made him well known in the bonsai community.  While his work was at first highly controversial, his energy and vision soon became as respected as his art. A characteristic of his trees is a defined interplay of artistically sculptured deadwood with a smaller amount of more traditionally appearing live wood snaking up from the soil to foliage apex.

The Drumcree conflict or Drumcree standoff is an ongoing dispute over a yearly parade in the town of Portadown, Northern Ireland. The dispute is between the Orange Order (an Ulster Protestant, unionist organization) and local residents, who are mostly Catholic and/or Irish nationalist. The residents are currently represented by the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition (GRRC); before 1995 they were represented mainly by the Drumcree Faith & Justice Group (DFJG). The Orange Order insists that it should be allowed to march its traditional route to-and-from Drumcree Church, just outside the town (see map). It had marched this route since 1807, when the area was sparsely populated. However, today most of this route is within the town's mainly Catholic quarter, which is densely populated. The residents, who see the parade as sectarian, triumphalist"Drumcree tension eases". BBC News. 13 May 1999. and supremacist, have sought to ban it from their area."Big changes in character of Drumcree dispute". Irish Independent. July 1998. The Orangemen see this as an attack on their traditions. The "Drumcree parade" is held on the Sunday before the Twelfth of July.
There have been intermittent violent clashes during the parade since at least 1873. The onset of the Troubles led to the dispute intensifying in the 1970s and 1980s. At this time, the most contentious part of the parade was the outward leg along Obins Street. After serious violence two years in a row, the parade was banned from Obins Street in 1986. The focus then shifted to the parade's return leg along Garvaghy Road. In 1995, the dispute drew the attention of the international media as it led to widespread protests and severe rioting throughout Northern Ireland. This was repeated every July for the next four years. During this time the dispute led to the deaths of at least five civilians and prompted a massive police and British Army operation. The British Army sealed-off the Catholic part of Portadown with large steel, concrete and barbed-wire barricades. Since 1998 the parade has been banned from most of the Catholic area, and the violence has subsided. However, regular moves to get the two sides into face-to-face talks have failed.

He studied in Mir and taught in Yeshiva Torah Vodaas prior to becoming rosh yeshiva at Shaar HaTorah.  Rabbi Epstein was considered by many to be the last of the Gedolim of his generation.See, e.g. Hamodia Magazine, October 21, 2009, p.3.
Rabbi Epstein maintained a relatively low profile – for example, he did not join the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, despite numerous invitations.See Hamodia Magazine, October 21, 2009, p.3.  His non-membership in the Moetzes, however, was a mere formality, as he still served as the address of last resort for many of the thorniest problems facing Klal Yisrael.Hamodia Magazine, October 21, 2009, p.3.  His approbation was sought (and received) for a number of major projects, such as the Schottenstein edition of both the Talmud Bavli and Yerushalmi.  He is known to have been a close confidant of several gedolim of the previous generation, including Rabbi Yaakov KamenetskySee Reb Yaakov by Yonason Rosenblum, p. 146 (Mesorah Publications, 1993). and Rabbi Elazar Shach.
Rabbi Epstein married a granddaughter of Rabbi Shimon Shkop, rosh yeshiva of the original Yeshiva Shaar HaTorah-Grodno.

The younger Rabbi Epstein also assisted his father in running the Yeshiva due to the latter's advanced age. 
Rabbi Epstein supported Rabbi Nathan Kamenetsky and his book Making of a Godol, stating in a letter to Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv that "in my opinion there is no justification whatsoever to ban the aforementioned book."See Making of a Godol

Tropical Storm Kiko was a strong tropical storm that capsized a boat off the western coast of Mexico, killing at least 15 people. The 15th and final tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko developed out of a tropical wave that formed off the coast of Africa on September 26 and traversed the Atlantic. The wave crossed over Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on October 8, where it spawned Tropical Depression 15-E on October 15. The depression drifted to the south over the next day before briefly being declared Tropical Storm Kiko. It subsequently weakened into a tropical depression, but later reattained tropical storm intensity. By October 18, Kiko was forecast to make landfall along the western Mexican coastline as a moderate tropical storm. However, the cyclone turned to the west and reached its peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) on October 20. The tropical storm slowly weakened to a remnant low-pressure area by October 24 and completely dissipated on October 27 without making landfall.

[[Wild Tigers I Have Known]]
CATEGORIES: 2006 films, English-language films, 2000s drama films, American teen LGBT-related films

Wild Tigers I Have Known is a 2006 feature film written, edited, produced and directed by Cam Archer. After being work-shopped at the 2005 Sundance Screenwriter's Lab, the film had its world premiere at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, and went on to be screened at New Directors/New Films, London International Film Festival, Locarno International Film Festival and AFI Film Festival. In 2007, the film was released theatrically by IFC Films. However, this is a re-edited shorter edition in (chronological) scenes, sound and duration, which leads to another interpretation of the director's intent with his movie. The original length was 1:38 min., and the ICF-film only 1.21 min. Some scenes have been deleted,  e.g. an episode in which the main character compares his penis' size with that of a friend is not included. The episode at the party in which Logan is overtly being accused by some older boys for being a faggot boy, is omitted too (Only the end by which he is punched in the nose is available), as well the scene that Logan goes, dressed up as Leah, to the house of his boyfriend Rodeo and talks to the girlfriend of him. In the original score the song 'Wild tigers I have known' by Emily Jane White was not included. To make it more confusing, shoots that are in the re-edited movie, are not be found in the original extended release, so considering this the film was probably about 1:50 minutes. Also there is a European DVD-release, issued by Soda, in which the IFC-film is even shorter, namely 1:13 minutes.
The film follows 13 year-old Logan (Malcolm Stumpf), as he comes to terms with his sexual identity, the hell of middle school, wild mountain lions and life with his single mother (Fairuza Balk).
Cinematographer and frequent Archer collaborator, Aaron Platt, received a 2007 Independent Spirit Award nomination for his work on the film. Gus Van Sant and producer Scott Rudin were executive producers on the project, in addition to producers Lars Knudsen and Jay Van Hoy.
The film was shot in and around Archer's hometown of Santa Cruz, California.

[[Vladimir Graić]]

CATEGORIES: University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering alumni, 1968 births, Living people, Serbian composers, Serbian songwriters

Vladimir Graić ([tpl]lang-sr|Владимир Граић[/tpl], born 19 February 1968) is a Serbian composer of popular, film and television music. Among other pieces, he composed the song Molitva, performed by Marija Šerifović, which won the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest.
Born in Belgrade, Serbia, to renowned composer Radoslav Graić, he had an affinity and showed aspiration for music from early childhood and began with private piano lessons at the age of four. While attending primary and secondary school, he continued simultaneously with his music education. At the age of six he was enrolled into the Music school “Josif Marinković” where he had piano lessons for 3 years. He then continued his studies in piano and theory from 1977 to 1982 at the Music school “Mokranjac”, the oldest, most respectable and most renowned Serbian musical institution, representing the foundation of musical culture and education in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia. After he finished secondary school, he graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering.
In the beginning, he was mostly interested in electro-pop music, but soon after he introduced a pure pop sound and since then has been writing immensely popular "pop" songs. He has also composed in most other music genres such as rock, electric, artistic, children’s music, etc. and since 2000 he is also involved with folk music in Serbia. Vladimir Graić always maintained that he wrote his serious pieces for himself and his less serious ones to make a living; nevertheless his melodic talent was so abundant that one can hardly distinguish a quality gradient between the two.
In 1996 he joined the Serbian state TV and radio broadcasting service Radio Television of Serbia (RTS), where he assumed the position of Music Editor of the RTS’s entertainment programme.  After six years, in 2002 he was promoted to the position of the Editor in Chief for Music Production at RTS’s music publishing house PGP RTS records. He had been always active in recording, enriching Serbian discography with dozens of records. Since he has been in this position, PGP has had over 300 releases in classic, etno, pop, rock and folk categories.
During 14 years of his professional engagement at the RTS, he created as an author or music director numerous entertainment TV shows: Hit 2000, Sunday Afternoon (Nedeljno popodne), Music Hot Report, Impulse (Impuls)...
In 1996 he began collaboration with the Serbian theaters, and wrote music for several plays of the contemporary theatrical repertoire.
A versatile, many-sided personality, he used his talents in many more artistic activities: he co-founded and co-directed the biggest Serbian pop music festival “Beovizija”, first held in 2003, and organized by RTS, the Serbian national broadcaster. In 2004, it became the Serbian semi-final to choose songs for the final of “Evropesma” (Eurosong). The winner of Evropesma was to represent Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2004 he founded the Radio Festival of Serbia (Radijski festival Srbije), organized by the most popular radio station in the country “Radio S”, promoting Serbian pop music. Apart from this, he has participated in all major music festivals as music director, member of the jury and author of compositions.
More than 20 of his compositions were awarded in different categories at music festivals throughout the country. His compositions have been awarded at international festivals as well:
Many of his compositions were entitled “Hit of the Year”, amongst others:
He was voted composer of the year on several occasions: 1994 (MESAM); 2000 (Oscar for Popularity); 2006 (“Zlatni melos”); 2007 (all over European countries)
He has also written the music for numerous advertising campaigns: Cosmopolitan (Serbian edition), Men's Health (Serbian edition), Hemofarm (International Pharmaceutical Group), Srbijašume (State Enterprise for Forest Management), Genex Kopaonik (Tourist Ski Center), etc.
From 1986 he is the member of the Association of jazz, popular and rock musicians in Serbia, and was the member of its Management Board from 1996 to 2000. He is also active as a member of the authors' music rights protection organization SOKOJ and he is member of Supervisory Board at the moment. From 1998 he is the member of the Composers' Association of Serbia and he is member of Management Board from 2011. From 2008 he was also member of GEMA.

The songs on the Guilty album were a collaboration between Streisand and all the members of the Bee Gees, including Barry's brothers, Robin and Maurice Gibb. But Barry Gibb played the largest role of the brothers on the album, co-writing and co-producing most of the tracks and appearing on the album cover embracing Streisand. Co-producer Karl Richardson was quoted describing Barry Gibb's contribution to this song: "He did the demo first. Barbra sang to the demo, then he came back and replaced a couple of things after he had heard what she was doing."Hyatt, Wesley (1999).

[[Central Avenue Jazz Festival]]
CATEGORIES: Festivals in Los Angeles, California, Jazz festivals in the United States

The Central Avenue Jazz Festival  is a yearly free jazz festival that takes place the last weekend of July in the South Central section of Los Angeles, which is the historical predominantly African-American area of the City.
Central Avenue, after which the area is named, was in the  1930s and 1940s a vibrant center for jazz.  At this time the infamous covenant line along Washington Boulevard demarcated the areas where blacks were allowed to live.  Even the giants of jazz music, such as Duke Ellington were allowed to play in Hollywood and other areas, but they could not stay there.  They often stayed at the now-historic Dunbar Hotel.  The Dunbar Hotel featured a nightclub called the Club Alabam, where the jazz greats would play after hours.  All around the hotel there were numerous other clubs featuring jazz and blues, which were the launching point for the careers of many well-known musicians.  One of the aims of the festival is to raise funds for the preservation of the Dunbar Hotel.
The festival takes place on several blocks of Central Avenue, south of Martin Luther King Boulevard, which includes the Dunbar Hotel.  There are many booths with food, arts and crafts, as well as community outreach programs.  The festival is free of charge, and in previous years has included free secure parking at a local school.
The festival was started in 1996 and has regularly featured a number of prominent jazz, blues, and Latin Jazz musicians who got their start in the area, such as Teddy Edwards, Gerald Wilson, Arthur Blythe and Ernie Andrews. A strong component of the festival's format has been to spotlight young Los Angeles musicians, such as Kamasi Washington,[tpl]cite web| url =http://www.centralavejazz.com | title = Central Avenue Jazz Festival 2009 Lineup | publisher =Department of Cultural Affairs, City of Los Angeles | accessdate =2010-01-27[/tpl] and Kalil Wilson, as well as talent from the neighborhood's high school bands and choirs.
The festival distinguishes itself in that it is a thoroughly non-commercial event.  There is no over-bearing corporate sponsorship and there are no concessions made to commercialism.

[[History of education in Chad]]

CATEGORIES: History of education by country, Education in Chad

The establishment of Protestant mission schools in southern Chad in the 1920s, followed by Roman Catholic and colonial state establishments in later decades, marked the beginning of Western education in Chad. From the outset, the colonial administration required that all instruction be in French, with the exception of religion classes, which could be taught in local languages. As early as 1925, the state imposed a standard curriculum on all institutions wishing official recognition and government subsidies. The state extended its influence to education, even though the majority of Chadian students attended private mission schools before World War II.Chad country study. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.
Education in Chad has focused on primary instruction. Until 1942, students who desired a secular secondary education had to go to schools in Brazzaville, the capital of the AEF. This restriction limited the number of secondary-school students. Between World War I and World War II, only a dozen Chadians studied in Brazzaville. Once in Brazzaville, students received technical instruction rather than a liberal arts education, entering three-year programmes designed to produce medical aides, clerks, or low-level technicians. State secondary schools were opened in Chad in 1942, but recognized certificate programs did not begin until the mid-1950s.
At independence in 1960, the government established a goal of universal primary education, and school attendance was made compulsory until age twelve. Nevertheless, the development of standard curricula was hampered by the limited number of schools, the existence of two- and three-year establishments alongside the standard five and seven-year colleges and lycées, and the Muslim preference for Quranic education. Even so, by the mid-1960s 17 percent of students between the ages of six and eight were in school. This number represented a substantial increase over the 8 percent attending school in the mid-1950s and the 1.4 percent immediately after World War II. Although the academic year in Chad parallels the French schedule, running from October to June, it is not particularly appropriate for a country where the hottest part of the April and May.
Quranic schools throughout the Saharan and Sahelian zones teach students to read Arabic and recite Quranic verse. Although traditional Islamic education at the secondary level has existed since the nineteenth century, students seeking advanced learning generally have studied in northern Cameroon, Nigeria, Sudan, or the Middle East. In Chad, modern Islamic secondary schools have included the Ecole Mohamed Illech, founded in 1918 and modelled after Egyptian educational institutions. Other schools included the Lycée Franco-Arabe, founded by the colonial administration in Abéché in 1952. The lycée offered a blend of Arabic, Quranic, and secular French education. Numerous observers believed that although the creation of a French-Islamic program of study was commendable, the administration's major objective was to counter foreign Islamic influence rather than to offer a viable alternative curriculum.
Despite the government's efforts, overall educational levels remained low at the end of the first decade of independence. In 1971 about 88 percent of men and 99 percent of women older than age fifteen could not read, write, or speak French, at the time the only official national language; literacy in Arabic stood at 7.8 percent. In 1982 the overall literacy rate stood at about 15 percent.
Major problems have hindered the development of Chadian education since independence. Financing has been very limited. Public expenditures for education amounted to only 14 percent of the national budget in 1963. Expenditures increased over the next several years but declined at the end of the decade. In 1969 funding for education dropped to 11 percent of the budget; the next year it declined still further to 9 percent. In the late 1980s, the government allotted only about 7 percent of its budget to education, a figure lower than that for all but a few African countries.
Limited facilities and personnel also have made it difficult for the education system to provide adequate instruction. Overcrowding is a major problem; some classes have up 100 students, many of whom are repeaters. In the years just after independence, many primary-school teachers had only marginal qualifications. On the secondary level, the situation was even worse; at the end of the 1960s, for example, the Lycée Ahmad Mangué in Sarh (formerly Fort-Archambault) had only a handful of Chadians among its several dozen faculty members. During these years, Chad lacked sufficient facilities for technical and vocational education to train needed intermediate-level technicians, and there was no university.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Chad made considerable progress in dealing with problems of facilities and personnel. To improve instruction, review sessions and refresher programs have been instituted for primary-school teachers. On the secondary level, increasing numbers of Chadians have taken their places in the ranks of the faculty. Furthermore, during the 1971-72 school year, the Université du Tchad opened its doors.
Another problem at independence was that the French curricula of Chadian schools limited their effectiveness. Primary instruction was in French, although most students did not speak that language when they entered school, and teaching methods and materials were often poorly suited to the rural settings of most schools. In addition, the academic program inherited from the French did not prepare students for employment options in Chad. Beginning in the late 1960s, the government attempted to address these problems. A number of model schools discarded the French-style of a formal, classical education in favor of a new approach that taught children to reinterpret and modify their social and economic environment. Rather than teaching French as it was taught in French schools to French children, the model schools taught it more appropriately as a foreign language. These new schools also introduced basic skills courses in the fourth year of primary school. Students who would probably not go on to secondary school were given the chance to attend agricultural training centers.
Unfortunately, all of the preceding problems were complicated by a fourth difficulty: the Chadian Civil War. Little has been written specifically about how this conflict has disrupted education, but several effects can reasonably be surmised. Lack of security in vast parts of the country undoubtedly has made it difficult to send teachers to their posts and to maintain them there, which has been particularly problematic because as government employees, teachers often have been identified with government policies. In addition, the mobility occasioned by the war has played havoc with attempts to get children to attend classes regularly. The diversion of resources to the conflict has also prevented the government from maintaining the expenditure levels found at independence, much less augmenting available funds. Finally, the violence has taken its toll among teachers, students, and facilities. One of the more dramatic instances of this was the destruction and looting of primary schools, lycées, and even the national archives attached to the Université du Tchad during the battles of N'Djamena in 1979 and 1980.
To its credit, the government has made major efforts to overcome these problems. In 1983 the Ministry of Planning and Reconstruction reported that the opening of the 1982-83 school year was the most successful since the upheavals of 1979. In 1984 the Université du Tchad, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, and the Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics reopened their doors as well.

The river flows over the Baraba Steppe in a southwesterly direction, and flows through the lakes of Sargul (Russian: Саргуль, 34,6 km²) and Uryum (Russian: Урюм, 84,1 km²), before it finally terminates, at 106 meters elevation, in Malyye Chany Lake (Russian: Малые Чаны – Little Chany), which is connected to Lake Chany through a short strait.
In its lower reaches the river is some 30 m wide and 5 m deep. Its main tributaries are the Suma River (left), and the Kargat River (right).
In its upper course is the town of Chulym, named after the river. Here the river is crossed by the Trans-Siberian Railway and the M51 highway.
The Chulym is frozen over from November to April/May.

That same year, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) retroactively updated their certifications database, using sales data from 1994 onwards, to automatically update unapplied certifications, as in the past the record label had to apply and keep data on sales. This update enabled their first three studio albums to be certified silver, Only Revolutions double platinum and their singles "Mountains" alongside "Many of Horror" both silver for 200,000 sales each.

[tpl]nihongo|Passion Yara|パッション屋良[/tpl] (born [tpl]nihongo|Chōbyō Yara|屋良 朝苗|Yara Chōbyō[/tpl], July 23, 1976 in the city of Nago, Okinawa) is a Japanese comedian. He is perhaps best known for the angry, passionate chest-beating in his comedy routine.
Passion Yara graduated from Kokushikan University's physical education department with the intention of becoming an educator. He is well-built, at 86 kg and 180 cm, and is capable of bench-pressing 160 kg. He enjoys bowling, darts, muscle training, touring, MTV, and canoeing. Passion Yara (Maseki Geinosha Official Site)
Yara is associated with the Maseki Geinosha entertainment agency. He has appeared on a variety of Japanese comedy-related TV shows and competitions in Japan, typically wearing a tight-fitting white gym outfit with an embroidered letter "P" on the collared shirt. His routine generally includes fits of maniacal, single-fisted chest-beating, for which he has gained some measure of notoriety. His act has been parodied by another Japanese comedian using the stage name, "Dark Yara".
Passion Yara performed his chest-beating act and other dance moves on the J-ska band Yum!Yum!ORANGE's music video for the song "Clover".
Yara has also performed as a competitor on Sasuke (known in the United States as Ninja Warrior), having entered at least two competitions, the 16th and 21st. In the 16th competition, he entertained spectators with his chest-beating before succumbing to the Rolling Log obstacle early in Stage 1. Ninja Warrior later declared him to be the 5th craziest competitor in the history of the event, referring to him in an aired segment as "Screaming Wacko". In the 21st competition, he surpassed his previous performance by reaching the Jumping Spider in Stage 1, where he subsequently fell and was eliminated.

Horizon Air, a regional airline based in SeaTac, Washington, serves 47 different destinations in the western United States, Canada and Mexico. Horizon Air's inaugural destinations in 1981 were Pasco, Seattle, and Yakima, Washington which were served with two wet leased Fairchild F-27 turboprop aircraft. In 1982, Horizon Air expanded into Oregon with a purchase of Air Oregon, and added service to seven new destinations.[tpl]cite video |people= |date=1982-06-01 |title=Horizon Air Timetable |url=http://www.airtimes.com/cgat/usb/horizon/qx820601.jpg |format=JPG|publisher=Horizon Air |accessdate=2008-10-25 [/tpl] One year later, Horizon acquired Transwestern Airlines of Utah and then expanded into the intermountain West region of the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/company/History/horizon-air-history.asp|title=Horizon Air History|publisher=Alaska Air Group|accessdate=2008-10-25[/tpl] Five of the seven routes introduced with the acquisition of Air Oregon are still served by Horizon, with the exceptions of North Bend/Coos Bay, Oregon and by December 2008, Pendleton, Oregon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.kcby.com/news/22181159.html|title=Horizon Air pulling out of North Bend and Klamath Falls|last=Novotny|first=Tim|date=2008-06-27|publisher=KCBY|accessdate=2008-10-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-187566766.html|title=Horizon Air to discontinue Pendleton Service.|date=2008-10-22|publisher=Airline Industry Information|accessdate=2008-10-25[/tpl] In 2008, Horizon restructured existing routes in order to transition to an all Bombardier Q400 fleet, removing the smaller Q200 turboprops as well as the CRJ 700 regional jets from the fleet.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.atwonline.com/news/story.html?storyID=13207|title=ATW Daily News|date=2008-07-01|publisher=Air Transport World|accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl]

Horizon Air launched its first Mexican route, flying a CRJ700 between Loreto, Mexico and Los Angeles, California in January 2008. Horizon has been flying to Canada since at least 1993, when service was added from Bellingham and Seattle to Calgary, Alberta.
On May 14, 2011, several routes that were formerly served by Horizon Air were transferred to SkyWest Airlines, operating under the name Alaska SkyWest.  SkyWest is operating five CRJ-700s purchased from Horizon Air under a capacity purchase agreement.  This means that SkyWest owns and operates the aircraft, while Alaska Airlines is responsible for marketing and selling tickets for the flights.

The Sikorsky S-16 (named after its designer) or RBVZ S-XVI (named after its manufacturer) was a Russian equi-span single-bay two-seat biplane designed by Igor Sikorsky in 1914-15. Conceived in response to demand for an escort fighter for the Ilya Muromets bombers, it was noteworthy in that it was one of the first aircraft to possess synchronisation gear for its 7.7mm machine gun. The first S-XVI was completed on 6 February 1915 with an 80 hp engine instead of the intended 100 hp because of supply problems. On 17 December 1915, the Russian government placed an order for 18 aircraft, these being delivered in early 1916.

[[Jack Taylor Gang]]
CATEGORIES: Outlaw gangs in the United States, Arizona Territory, People of the American Old West

The Jack Taylor Gang (ca. 1884 to 1887) was an outlaw gang of the Old West which operated mostly in Arizona Territory and Mexico.
The gang was first organized by Jack Taylor, a minor outlaw with moderate skills in train robbery. This brought the gang to the attention of later famed Railroad Detective Jeff Milton, and Cochise County, Arizona Sheriff John Slaughter, under whom Milton was at that time working as a Deputy Sheriff. The gang built a reputation for being particularly cruel, and quick to shoot when confronted, and were wanted mainly for the murder of a train engineer in Sonora, and another train robbery in which they killed four passengers. In 1887, Sheriff Slaughter received information that several members of the gang were hiding out at the rural home of Flora Cardenas. However, by the time Slaughter and his posse had reached her house, the gang members, identified as Geronimo Miranda, Manuel Robles, Nieves Deron and Fred Federico, had fled.
Sheriff Slaughter and Jeff Milton tracked them to Contention City, Arizona, to the home of wood cutter Guadeloupe Robles, brother to Manuel Robles. Gang members Nieves Deron and Manuel Robles were hiding there, and without warning Sheriff Slaughter, Milton, and his deputies stormed the house. Guadeloupe Robles was shot dead by Slaughter, while Nieves Deron opened fire on Slaughter and his posse, with one bullet grazing Slaughter's ear lobe. The two gang members fled toward the rocks near the house, exchanging fire with the posse as they ran. Slaughter and two of his deputies shot and killed Deron, and shot and wounded Manuel Robles, who, though wounded, escaped into a thicket. During that same month, gang leader Jack Taylor was captured in Mexico by the Mexican Rurales, and sentenced to life in prison.
The remaining members of the gang, Manuel Robles, Geronimo Miranda and Fred Federico, were still at large. Robles had yet to fully recover from his gunshot wounds suffered in Contention City, and this was being hindered by his having to remain constantly on the move. Robles and Miranda were shot and killed during a gunbattle with the Mexican Rurales in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains later in 1887. On August 12, 1888, gang member Fred Federico mistook Deputy Sheriff Cesario Lucero for Sheriff Slaughter, in a planned ambush. Federico shot and killed Deputy Lucero, and was captured shortly thereafter. He was hanged, and was the last of the Jack Taylor Gang.

Onchidal is a naturally occurring toxin produced as a defensive secretion by the mollusc Onchidella binneyi and several other related species in Onchidella,a genus of small, air-breathing sea slugs. It acts as an irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, the same mechanism of action as that of the deadly nerve agents, however onchidal is not an organophosphorus or carbamate compound and bears little resemblance to other compounds of this nature.Abramson SN, Radic Z, Manker D, Faulkner DJ, Taylor P.

CATEGORIES: Operas, English-language operas, 1745 operas, Operas by John Frederick Lampe, Operas based on Greco-Roman mythology, Operas based on A Midsummer Night's Dream

Pyramus and Thisbe is a "mock opera" by the German-born composer John Frederick Lampe on the story of Pyramus and Thisbe. It was first performed at Covent Garden Theatre, London on 25 January 1745.  The anonymous libretto (possibly the work of the composer or Henry Carey) is based on Richard Leveridge's The Comickal Masque of Pyramus and Thisbe (1716), itself inspired by the "play within a play" in Act V of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. 
This was the last of Lampe's operas, and was a much-needed success after a difficult period for musicians in the London theatre. In 1741 the revolution in Shakespearean acting initiated by Macklin and Garrick diverted attention away from music, and Lampe produced no new work in the major theatres for four years. Pyramus returns to the vein of burlesque that he mined in The Dragon of Wantley (1737), his first popular success; it ridicules Italian-style opera and opera singers rather than Shakespeare's plays and players. The onstage audience, originally Duke Theseus and his entourage, consists of Mr Semibrief (the impresario) and two gentlemen, one of whom has experienced Italian opera at first hand on the grand tour; they interject facetious spoken comments as the all-sung opera proceeds. The story follows Shakespeare closely: the Wall (tenor) sports a chink through which Pyramus (tenor) and Thisbe (soprano) arrange to meet 'at Ninny's tomb'. Thisbe arrives first and is frightened away by the Lion (bass), who sings a splendid roaring aria. After the Moon (tenor) has sung a lyrical Arne-like number, Pyramus appears, fears the worst and stabs himself 'like a hero in Italian opera, to very good time and tune'; Thisbe follows suit. But they are revived by Mr Semibrief in time to sing the epilogue. Lampe's music is charming and largely deadpan, though there are the standard Handelian rage and revenge arias. The full score (London, 1745/ R 1988) omits the secco recitatives, a dance and the last chorus.

CATEGORIES: Operas, Operas by Georg Philipp Telemann, German-language operas, 1725 operas, Intermezzi

Pimpinone, TWV 21:15, is a comic opera by the German composer Georg Philipp Telemann with a libretto by Johann Philipp Praetorius. Its full title is Die Ungleiche Heirat zwischen Vespetta und Pimpinone oder Das herrsch-süchtige Camer Mägden (The Unequal Marriage Between Vespetta and Pimpinone or The Domineering Chambermaid). The work is described as a Lustiges Zwischenspiel ("comic intermezzo") in three parts. It was first performed at the Theater am Gänsemarkt, Hamburg on 27 September 1725 as light relief between the acts of Telemann's adaptation of Handel's opera seria Tamerlano. Pimpinone was highly successful and pointed the way forward to later intermezzi, particularly Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's La serva padrona.

[[Renard R.36]]
CATEGORIES: Belgian fighter aircraft 1930–1939, Renard aircraft

The Renard R.36 was a Belgian all-metal fighter aircraft designed to replace the Fairey Firefly II within the Belgian Air Force. Designed to improve on the Renard Epervier, which was never adopted by the Belgian government, the prototype R.36 first flew on 5 November 1937. de Wulf 1977, p.186.  Following testing the R.36 was approved by the Belgian Air Force in late 1938, with 40 aircraft provisionally ordered, to be delivered in two years. de Wulf 1977, pp.186-187. However, on 17 January 1939 the prototype, OO-ARW, crashed near Nivelles, killing pilot Lt. Visconte Eric de Spoelberg. The official investigation was inconclusive, no evidence of material failure being discovered, with the most probable causes being radio equipment coming loose during a high-G manoeuver, jamming the controls, or the pilot becoming incapacitated.  The airframe had accumulated 75:30 hours flight time.  The order was then dropped in favour of licence production of the Hawker Hurricane by SABCA. de Wulf 1977, p.187.

He was also the primary national goalkeeper during his day with Terengganu, beating many other goalkeepers like Mohd Hamsani Ahmad, Azmin Azram Abdul Aziz and Azizon Abdul Kadir. 
He was part of the Malaysian squad that faced Brazil and Manchester United F.C. in 2002. He also represented Malaysia in the 2001 and 2003 SEA Games, the 2002 Tiger Cup, the 2004 Tiger Cup, and the 2007 ASEAN Football Championship.

[[Felipe Cardeña]]

CATEGORIES: 21st-century Spanish painters, 1979 births, Living people

Felipe Cardeña is a very well known artist that nobody has ever seen. The newspaper "Corriere della Sera" wrote on Maj 2008: "We only thing we know is that he was born in Balaguer, Spain, 29 years ago. The rest of the information we have regarding Felipe Cardeña, mysterious artist Banksy's style, is fragmentary and contradictory. His floreal collages – whose technique was probably developed in jail – and his floreal stickers appear everywhere: his slogan is Power Flower"(1). Maybe behind Felipe Cardeña's identity there is a collective of artists with differents backgrounds and origins, probably related to the street art world. Certanly one of the first exhibitions where he appeared was in the 2005 in Milan, Miracolo a Milano (2), by acting as the statue of St John the Headless, and where he stood without a single movement for six hours. In 2007, he put the pirates flag right at the entrance of the exhibit Sweet Art Street Art  as the symbol of street artists who fought and won over the Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea, in Milan. Eventually, his art work was stolen by one of the visitors. Since the end of 2007 he started the project "Power Flower". In 2008 Felipe Cardena prepared a gigantic panel to be shown at the street art exhibit Scala Mercalli, dedicated to the Dalai Lama. "Free Tibet Free Flowers" was written on the panel in capital letters. in 2009 he exposed a giant panel with the portrait of Che Guevara "floreciente" in L'Avana, Cuba, for the Arte Mas 2009, Festival Internacional de arte y Literatura joven. His most recent art work is based on the idea of “surprise” and “astonishment”: large – sometimes monumental – colorful flower compositions, eccentric collages, unusual shapes, strongly exaggerated images underlining the themes of religion and cultural diversity, a mixture of human and natural forms.
Vittorio Sgarbi wrote that "Felipe Cardeña proposes the amateur technique of collage pursuing a repetitive and obsessive iconography as the daily rosary of a cloistered nun". (3)

Reginald Newnham "Reg" Ellis (22 February 1891 – 26 May 1959) was an Australian sportsman who played first-class cricket for Victoria and Australian rules football in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Ellis, a defender, played 53 games in the VFL, all but one of them for St Kilda from 1913 to 1915. He had been recruited from Sydney and participated in St Kilda's 1913 VFL Grand Final loss to Fitzroy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/games/1913/061519130927.html|title=1913 VFL Grand Final| publisher=AFL Tables[/tpl] In 1920, after not playing at all during the war, Ellis returned to the league and signed up with Melbourne. He made just one appearance for the club.
His cricket career began over seven years after he played his last VFL game and he was aged 36 when he made his first-class debut against Tasmania. The Victorian opening pair in the first innings of Fred Baring and Basil Onyons were also league footballers as was their wicket-keeper Stuart King. Ellis came in at three and made just the one run before being dismissed. He made amends in the second innings with a century. His even hundred allowed Victoria to chase their fourth innings target of 182 with five wickets in hand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/12/12559.html|title=Tasmania v Victoria 1927/28| publisher=CricketArchive[/tpl]
Ellis went on to represent Victoria in the 1928/29 and 1929/30 Sheffield Shield seasons. He finished with 355 runs from his seven first-class matches at an average of 29.58. His only other century came in a Shield encounter against Queensland at the MCG in 1928 when he made an unbeaten 107. Ellis also took three wickets in his career, including dismissing Test player Alan Fairfax.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/12/12931.html|title=Victoria v Queensland 1928/29| publisher=CricketArchive[/tpl]

[[The Ladies' Diary]]

CATEGORIES: Almanacs, Annual magazines, Defunct magazines of the United Kingdom, Publications established in 1704, Magazines disestablished in 1841, 1704 establishments in England

The Ladies' Diary: or, Woman's Almanack appeared annually in London from 1704 to 1841 after which it was succeeded by The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary.[tpl]cite book|last=Baum|first=Joan|title=The Calculating Passion of Ada Byron|year=1986|publisher=Archon Books|location=Hamden, Connecticut|page=35[/tpl] It featured material relating to calendars etc. including sunrise and sunset times and phases of the moon, as well as important dates (eclipses, holidays, school terms, etc.), and a chronology of remarkable events.
The  subtitle indicated its serious purpose: "Containing New Improvements in ARTS and SCIENCES, and many entertaining PARTICULARS: Designed for the USE AND DIVERSION OF THE FAIR SEX." These included riddles (called enigmas), rebuses, charades, scientific queries, and mathematical questions. A typical volume in the series included answers submitted by readers to problems posed the previous year and a set of new problems, nearly all proposed by readers. Both puzzle and answer (revealed the following year) were often in verse.  Each cover featured a picture of a prominent English woman.[tpl]cite journal|last=Albree|first=John|coauthors=Brown, Scott H.|title="A valuable monument of mathematical genius": The Ladies' Diary (1704–1840)|journal=Historia Mathematica|date=Feb 2009|year=2009|month=February|volume=36|issue=1|pages=10–47|doi=10.1016/j.hm.2008.09.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086008000967|accessdate=8 April 2013[/tpl]
(Sometimes the subtitles were even more specific. For example, in 1836 the full title was The Ladies Diary, For the Year of Our Lord 1835, Being the Third After Bissextile. Designed specifically For the Amusement and Entertainment of The Fair Sex With An Appendix of Curious and Valuable Mathematical Papers For the Use of Students. The Hundred and Thirty Second Almanack Published of this Kind. Also The Gentleman's Diary Or, The Mathematical Repository; An Almanack For the Year of Our Lord 1835 and 1836 Being The Third or Bissextile or Leap Year Containing many Useful and entertaining Particulars peculiarly adapted to the Ingenious Gentleman engaged in the delightful Study and Practice of the Mathematicks.)
The first editor and publisher, John Tipper, began the almanac by publishing a calendar, recipes, medicinal advice, stories and ended with "special rhyming riddles." By the 1709 issue, the contents changed to exclude recipes, medicinal advice, and stories and include more puzzles from both Tipper and those sent in by readers.
The second editor, Henry Beighton, took over the almanac after Tipper's death in 1713. He continued to publish the almanac rich in puzzles, and in 1720 began to include more difficult puzzles dealing with Newtonian infinitesimal calculus.

[[Gamma ray]]

CATEGORIES: Radiation, Radioactivity, Nuclear physics, IARC Group 1 carcinogens, Gamma rays, Electromagnetic spectrum

Gamma radiation, also known as gamma rays, and denoted by the Greek letter γ, refers to electromagnetic radiation of extremely high frequency and therefore high energy per photon. Gamma rays are ionizing radiation, and are thus biologically hazardous. They are classically produced by the decay from high energy states of atomic nuclei (gamma decay), but are also created by other processes. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard's radiation was named "gamma rays" by Ernest Rutherford in 1903.
Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally occurring radioisotopes, and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. Rare terrestrial natural sources produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. Additionally, gamma rays are also produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary gamma rays via bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation. However, a large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft.
Gamma rays typically have frequencies above 10 exahertz (or >1019 Hz), and therefore have energies above 100 keV and wavelengths less than 10 picometers (less than the diameter of an atom). However, this is not a hard and fast definition, but rather only a rule-of-thumb description for natural processes. Gamma rays from radioactive decay are defined as gamma rays no matter what their energy, so that there is no lower limit to gamma energy derived from radioactive decay. Gamma decay commonly produces energies of a few hundred keV, and almost always less than 10 MeV. In astronomy, gamma rays are defined by their energy, and no production process need be specified. The energies of gamma rays from astronomical sources range over 10 TeV, at a level far too large to result from radioactive decay.

These bursts of gamma rays, thought to be due to the collapse of stars called Hypernovae, are the most powerful events so far discovered in the cosmos.

The village has a population of 1,060, and in 1405-1869 it had a status of a town.
Urzędów lies on the Urzędówka river, among the hills of the Lublin Upland. In the past, it used to be one of major urban centers of eastern Lesser Poland, placed on a merchant road from Kraków to Lublin, and further on to Lithuania. The town was granted Magdeburg rights in 1405 by King Władysław Jagiełło, replacing two villages - Zaborzyce and Skorczyce, which had existed in the location of Urzędów. In 1474 it became the seat of a county in Lublin Voivodeship, which in the same year was carved out of Sandomierz Voivodeship. Urzędów remained an important urban center of the area until the mid-17th century, when, after long - lasting conflicts with the Cossacks and the Swedes (see Deluge, Khmelnytsky Uprising) it was burned. Urzędów lost its town privileges in 1869, never to recover them.

Paroecopolis is presented by Sophrone Pétridès in a 1911 article in the Catholic Encyclopedia as a bishopric of uncertain name (Paroecopolis, Parthicopolis, Parthenopolis) and situated either in Macedonia, or in Thrace. 
Pétridès relates that the town is mentioned by PtolemyIII, 13, 30. as being in Sintice, a part of Macedonia, and by Phlegon."Fragm. histor. gr." ed. Didot, III, 609. HieroclesSynecdemus, 639, 8. and Constantine PorphyrogenitusDe thematibus'', 2. call it Parthicopolis, but the second locates it in Thrace. Stephanus Byzantius calls it Parthenopolis and relates according to Theagenes the legend of its foundation by Grastus, son of Mygdon, said to have named the city in honour of his two daughters. PlinyIV, xi. has the same name, but places it in Thrace.
Its bishop, Jonas or John, assisted at the Council of Sardica (342 or 343); at the Council of Chalcedon (451) there was present John "Parthicopolis primæ Macedoniae".Le Quien, Oriens christianus, II, 75.
This see is not mentioned in any of the Greek Notitiae episcopatuum, nor is there any mention of it, under any of the three names, in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1), pp. 949-950

CATEGORIES: 1956 films, 1950s drama films, 1950s musical films, American musical drama films, American rock music films, American teen drama films, English-language films, Independent films, Public domain films

Rock, Rock, Rock! is a 1956 black-and-white motion picture featuring performances from a number of early rock 'n' roll stars, such as Chuck Berry, LaVern Baker, Teddy Randazzo, The Moonglows, The Flamingos, and The Teenagers with Frankie Lymon as lead singer. Future West Side Story cast member David Winters is also featured.  Famed disk jockey Alan Freed makes an appearance as himself. The voice of the main character (Dori Graham) was sung by Connie Francis.  
The movie has a fairly simple plot: teenage girl Dori Graham (played by then 13-year-old Tuesday Weld) can't convince her dad to buy her a strapless gown and has to get the money together herself in time for the prom.
The soundtrack album, also titled Rock, Rock, Rock, is nowadays widely regarded as Chuck Berry's first album.Chuck Berry's Collector Guide Many of the artists featured in the film do not appear on the album, and only four songs on the album ("Over and Over Again," "I Knew From the Stars," "You Can't Catch Me," and "Would I Be Crying") actually appear in the film.
Both Jack Collins and Valerie Harper (who makes a brief appearance as an extra in the crowd at the prom) made their film debut in Rock, Rock, Rock.
In 1984, the film entered the public domain (in the USA) due to the claimants failure to renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.[tpl]cite journal |first=David |last=Pierce |date=June 2007 |title=Forgotten Faces: Why Some of Our Cinema Heritage Is Part of the Public Domain  |journal=Film History: An International Journal |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125–43 |issn=0892-2160 |oclc=15122313 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25165419 |accessdate=2012-01-05 |doi=10.2979/FIL.2007.19.2.125 [/tpl]

The LVG E.I was a German two-seat monoplane of World War I. The E.I was unusual among monoplanes of its time in that it featured ailerons as opposed to the then-conventional (for monoplanes) wing warping. 
It was fitted with both a rearward firing machine gun, mounted on a flexible ring mounting, and a forward firing synchronized machine gun and was very probably the first aircraft to be so armed.
The only prototype was destroyed on its way to the front for testing in 1915; as such, very little is known about the E.I, or its synchronization gear.

Dokufest is an International Documentary and Short Film Festival that is held every year during August in Prizren, Kosovo. It started in 2002. This Festival attracts numerous international and regional artists. In this annually organized festival, films are designed to be screened throughout the day, in two open air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas accompanied with the program of activities. Except for its films, the festival is also well known for lively nights after the screening. Various events happen within the scope of the festival: workshops, DokuPhoto exhibitions, festival camping, concerts, which together turn the city into a lively and colorful place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dokufest.com/?cid=2,7|title=Dokufest Website|author=dokufest.com[/tpl]
DokuFest, since its establishment has proven that through consistent work and dedication, a volunteer based organization with almost no funding at the beginning, could become one of the leading cultural organizations in Kosovo and the region. 
However, this path has often been associated with major difficulties due to the unique context that organization operated (post war situation, lack of similar referent events, lack of trust from institutions and potential donors etc.) as well as specific obstacles in running the film festival (lack of infrastructure, insufficient technical personnel and lack of local film production, to name a few). Inevitably, the circumstances led us to adopt trial and error methodology in first years prior to embarking on a more structured and consolidated modus of operation. This painful switch was achieved predominantly through motivated and mostly by committed voluntary work of its staff, making possible the growth and popularity that DokuFest enjoys today. This also proved a need to adopt higher professional standards in its structure and phase-out the volunteer based structure.
Initial consolidation of staffing structure started in 2008, through introduction of full-time and part-time contracts that led to the employment of a small number of staff. The need for an organizational structure arose when the organization became involved in implementation of yearly-based projects, in addition to organizing the festival. This led to the establishment of a core team that took over the design, planning and implementation of many initiatives resulting in successful implementation of several projects. 
To date DokuFest has proven not only as a leader when it comes to organization of large-scale cultural events, but also as a successful partner and driving force in the fields of culture, education and activism for sound cultural policies and alternative education system in Kosovo. 
The overall programme involves organization of:
(1)	Annual International Documentary and Short Film Festival that includes screening of films in seven improvised cinema’s in the city of Prizren, photographic exhibition “DokuPhoto”, Workshops, Master Classes and debates, amongst others.
(2)	Film training initiative called “Human Rights’s Film Factory - Stories from Kosovo’s Margins” that includes series of workshops for filmmakers, production of six documentaries on Human Rights coupled with series of human rights debates throughout Kosovo.
(3)	Promotion of Human Rights and Democratic Values through Film that includes usage of human rights documentary films as educational tools and establishment of Kino Clubs in Highs Schools as well as Documentary film school guiding high school students from Kosovo throughout the process of transforming their film ideas into a finished documentary. The films will be screened in a special programme at DokuFest 2013.
(4)	Travelling Cinema “Cinema at Your Door” aiming at documentary film screenings in rural areas of Prizren region coupled with discussions focusing on the difficulties that rural communities experience in their everyday life and the lack of the cultural activities in their surroundings.
(5)	Part of larger NGO network working actively on environmental related issues and promotion of renewables in Kosovo. 
(6)	Active participation and contribution on national and regional networks, aimed at development of sound cultural policies and organization of debates with relevant stakeholders, both in Kosovo and the region.

The Morane-Saulnier G was a sports aircraft produced in France in the years before the First World War.Taylor 1989, 648"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft", 2539 It was a development of the racing monoplanes designed by Léon Morane and Raymond Saulnier after leaving Borel and, like its predecessors, was a wire-braced, shoulder-wing monoplane. Construction was of fabric-covered wood throughout, except for the undercarriage struts which were of steel tube."The Latest Morane-Saulnier Monoplane", 564
The type was a sporting success. In April 1913, Roland Garros took second place in the inaugural Schneider Cup in a floatplane version,Hartmann 2001, 10. This machine is often reported as a Type H finishing with a time of 40 minutes 40 seconds."The Monaco Meeting", 450 On 26 June, Claude Grahame-White flew another float-equipped example from Paris to London via Le Havre, Boulogne-sur-Mer, and Dover,"Mr Grahame-Wnite's Seine—Thames Trip" covering some [tpl]convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] that day.Hartmann 2001, 10 Between 21 and 28 September the same year, two float-equipped Type Gs competed at the seaplane meeting at San Sebastián, with Lord Carbery winning the short take-off prize on one, and Edmond Audemars winning the maneuverability prize on the other.Hartmann 2001, 11 The following week, Carbery flew his Type G in the Italian Waterplane Contest from Lake Como to Pavia and back, along with two other Type Gs in the field of fifteen competitors, these flown by Garros and Morane.Hartmann 2001, 12"Italian Waterplane Contest", 1129 Garros not only won the Grand Prize in the "general class", but also the prizes for best speed (127.7 km/h, 79.8 mph) and greatest altitude (2,100 m, 6,000 ft).
In 1914, Russian manufacturer Duks arranged to build the type under licence at their Moscow factory for the Russian Army, and the same year, the Turkish military ordered 40 examples. Before these could be delivered, however, war broke out, and the aircraft were impressed into the French Army. To these, the Army soon added an order of 94 aircraft, and the British Royal Flying Corps also acquired a number, these latter machines purchased from Grahame-White, who was manufacturing the type in the UK under licence. At the outbreak of war, the type's military value was found to be wanting, and the French machines were quickly relegated to training duties.
Despite this, a dedicated single-seat fighter version was built in 1915, armed with an 8 mm Hotchkiss machine gun that fired through the propeller arc, the propeller blades being protected by deflector plates."Morane-Saulnier type G" Only one or two prototypes were built, and the type never entered service.Green and Swanborough 1994
Some Type Gs were modified by Morane-Saulnier to have their wings mounted above the fuselage, parasol-fashion, rather than at the fuselage sides. This arrangement was found to offer far better visibility for the pilot, and formed the basis for the Morane-Saulnier L.
A Type G is preserved at the Museo del Aire de Cuatrovientos in Madrid.

Kitanglad Mountain Range is a mountain range that dominates the northern central portion of the province of Bukidnon. It occupies portions of eight of the municipalities and cities in the province such as Talakag, Baungon, Libona, Manolo Fortich, Impasug-ong, Lantapan and Malaybalay City. The range is one of the few remaining rainforests in the Philippines, hosting one of the most important diverse species of rare and endemic wildlife such as the Philippine Eagle. Five of its peaks have very high elevations: Mount Dulang-dulang, the highest at 2,938 meters; Mount Kitanglad at 2,899 meters; Mount Maagnaw at 2,742 meters; Mount Lumuluyaw at 2,612 meters; and Mount Tuminungan at 2,400 meters.[tpl]cite web|title=Mt.

The name "kitanglad" was derived from a legend that there was once a great flood that submerged the native lands of Bukidnon and only the tip of the mountain, the size of a "tanglad" (lemon grass), remained visible ("kita" in Cebuano).
The whole range was declared a national park by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 677 on December 4, 1990 known as the Mount Kitanglad Range Natural Park. In 1994, it was chosen as one of the 10 priority sites under the World Bank through the Conservation of Priority Protected Areas Project. Mount Kitanglad and its outlying area was proclaimed a protected area under the natural park category through Presidential Proclamation 896 dated October 24, 1996. On November 9, 2000, the park finally became a full-pledge protected area when Congress approved R.A. 8978 also known as the Mt.

CATEGORIES: Gerromorpha

Water treaders, the superfamily Mesovelioidea are insects in the order Hemiptera, the true bugs. They are semi-aquatic insects that live in moist and wet habitat and on wet plant matter in several types of aquatic habitat.Yang, C. M. and D. H. Murphy. (2011). Guide to the aquatic Heteroptera of Singapore and peninsular Malaysia. 6. Mesoveliidae, with description of a new Nereivelia species from Singapore. Raffles Bulletin of Zoology 59, 53-60.
These insects are no more than 3.5 millimeters long. They have elongated heads, long antennae, and large eyes, with the exception of Cryptovelia, which have vestigial eyes. Females are larger than the males of their species and have well developed ovipositors.
The type genus, Mesovelia, contains about 27 species, many of which are common and widespread.Andersen, N. M. and D. A. Polhemus. (2003). A new genus of terrestial Mesovellidae from the Seychelles (Hemiptera: Gerromorpha). Journal of the New York Entomological Society (111), 12-21. The other genera are small or even monotypic, and are less common. 
One species is known for its unique specific name, Cavaticovelia aaa, sometimes called the aaa water treader. It is a legitimate binomial name featuring aaa, the Hawaiian word for "lava tube".Yanega, D. Scientific Names Curious Scientific Names. University of California, Riverside. 2013.
According to some treatments, there are two families in the Mesovelioidea.Mesovelioidea Douglas & Scott, 1867.

The German DRG Class 02 (Baureihe 02 or BR 02) engines were standard (Einheitslokomotiven) express train locomotives with the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft. Number 02 001 was the first Einheitsdampflokomotive in the DRG to be completed.
In procuring a standard express train steam locomotive, the Deutsche Reichsbahn carried out a comparison between a superheated two-cylinder type (the DRG Class 01) and a four-cylinder compound locomotive (the Class 02). Ten examples of each type were built from 1925, and the Class 02 vehicles were given operating numbers 02 001 – 02 010. The first eight engines were manufactured in 1925 by the firm of Henschel, two more were built in 1926 by Maffei.
Because the Class 02 steam engines were badly designed, the compound engine could only produce a high level of power at speeds of over 70 km/h. In addition, below 1000 PSi its steam consumption was higher than that of the Class 01.
Compared with the Class 01s, these engines had a complicated, and therefore maintenance-intensive, drive; as a result no more were ordered. From 1937 to 1942 the vehicles were successively converted to two-cylinder operation and regrouped as Class 01s with the new numbers 01 011 and 01 233 – 01 241. 
The first eight engines were equipped with  2'2' T 30 tenders; the other two with 2'2 T 32 tenders. Later on, the second tender was coupled to all of the first eight engines as well.

Perséphone (Persephone) is a musical work (mélodrame) for speaker, solo singers, chorus, dancers and orchestra with music by Igor Stravinsky and a libretto by André Gide.
It was first performed under the direction of the composer at the Opéra, Paris on April 30, 1934 in a double bill with the ballet "Diane de Poitiers" by Jacques Ibert. The premiere was staged by the ballet company of Ida Rubinstein, with Rubinstein herself dancing and speaking the part of Persephone and the tenor René Maison singing Eumolphe.
It was also premiered at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires under Stravinsky himself in 1934, and then in Rio de Janeiro. Victoria Ocampo, an important intellectual from Argentina, was present at the premier in Buenos Aires. It was reprised at the Colón in 1995 with China Zorrilla under Pedro Ignacio Calderón.
Other choreographed versions have included those of George Balanchine, Kurt Jooss (1955), Frederick Ashton (1961),Persephone on Frederick Ashton page of ROH archive online and Pina Bausch (1965).  (Martha Graham's "Persephone," ironically, is accompanied by Stravinsky's Symphony in C.)
It was recorded by Stravinsky himself with Vera Zorina and also under André Cluytens (with Nicolai Gedda, 1955, Paris), Sir Andrew Davis (with Paul Groves, London) and Michael Tilson Thomas (with Stuart Neill, 1999, San Francisco).

Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum (from Greek "hydr-" water and "argyros" silver). A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature.
Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion, a pure form of mercuric sulfide, is mostly obtained by reaction of mercury (produced by reduction from cinnabar) with sulfur.  Mercury poisoning can result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), inhalation of mercury vapor, or eating seafood contaminated with mercury.
Mercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, fluorescent lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favour of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments.  Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam material for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in lighting: electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.

It authorized the Federal Housing Administration to guarantee up to $300 billion in new 30-year fixed rate mortgages for subprime borrowers if lenders write-down principal loan balances to 90 percent of current appraisal value.  It was intended to restore confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by strengthening regulations and injecting capital into the two large U.S. suppliers of mortgage funding.  States are authorized to refinance subprime loans using mortgage revenue bonds.  Enactment of the Act led to the government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

[[DRG Class 23]]

CATEGORIES: Steam locomotives of Germany, 2-6-2 locomotives, Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft locomotives, Railway locomotives introduced in 1941

The German Class 23 (Baureihe 23 or BR 23) engines of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) were standard (Einheitslokomotiven) steam engines that were conceived as a replacement for the  Prussian P 8 by the Schichau Works. They were given the same boiler as the Class 50s which were developed in parallel and, like them, the newly developed 2'2' T 26 tender with its front wall that protected train crews during reverse running.
In 1941 the two prototypes were built and delivered. The procurement of 800 locomotives had been planned, however the constraints of the Second World War meant that they never entered full production.
After the war the two locomotives, with operating numbers 23 001 and 23 002, went to the DR in East Germany and were variously stabled in Berlin, Brandenburg an der Havel, Jüterbog and Halle. In 1961, number 23 001 was given a Reko boiler with combustion chamber, developed for the Class 50. In 1970 the locomotive was given EDP number 35 2001-2. Number 23 002 was to be reconstructed, but was retired however in 1967 due to damage to the frame and scrapped.
Number 23 001 was scrapped in 1975 in Cottbus, as it could no longer serve any useful purpose.
After the war, the design of these Class 02 locomotives formed the basis for the new DB Class 23 and DR Class 23.10 locomotives which received the same class designation.

Gordon Arthur (born 30 May 1958 in Kirkcaldy) is a Scottish former footballer who played as a goalkeeper for a number of Scottish clubs.
Beginning his senior career with Dundee in 1975, Arthur failed to make a first-team appearance and moved to Stirling Albion in 1977, featuring in nearly 200 league matches for The Binos before moving to Dumbarton in 1984. Arthur was a first-team regular in his four years at Boghead and moved to hometown club Raith Rovers in 1988. In six years at Stark's Park, Arthur played in over 150 league matches, tasting promotion to the Premier Division when the club won the Scottish First Division championship in 1992-93. A move to Forfar Athletic beckoned in 1994 following Raith's relegation and after playing in just under 100 league games for them, including winning the 1994-95 Scottish Third Division, Arthur saw out his career with spells at Arbroath and Montrose. Upon retiring, Arthur remained at Montrose as goalkeeping coach.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player1/gordonarthur.html|title=Gordon Arthur|publisher=neilbrown.newcastlefans.com|accessdate=28 July 2008[/tpl]

[[Zagrebačka Avenue]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Zagreb, Trešnjevka

Zagrebačka Avenue is an important east-west avenue in western Zagreb, Croatia. It is a dual carriageway with three lanes in each direction that starts as a continuation of the Slavonska Avenue under the intersection with the Savska Road, ending at the Savska Opatovina roundabout.
It was previously part of Ljubljanska Avenue, which used to span from the Jankomir interchange to Savska Road in the outer city center, but in 2006 a part of Ljubljanska Avenue was widened and separated from the old avenue to be named to Zagrebačka Avenue at the proposal of Mayor Milan Bandić. After the widening the Savska Opatovina rotary (technically a roundabout interchange) was added, but none of other intersections were converted to interchanges, though, and Bandić was publicly criticized because of that problem., as well as for making, by some accounts, an unnecessary and confusing name change for the street.

Gennadi Zakharov was a Soviet physicist who worked for the United Nations.
In 1986, a Guyanese student, known to the world only as “C.S.”, met him at a subway station in the Queens borough of New York. C.S. had known Zakharov for about three years. He had been helped by Zakharov in his studies and in securing a job with a defense subcontractor.
During their encounter in the subway station, C.S. handed over an envelope that contained classified documents describing United States Air Force jet engines in exchange for $1,000 in cash. Immediately after the exchange, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation swarmed around Zakharov, subduing him and shackling him in handcuffs. It was only then that Zakharov discovered that C.S. was working undercover with the FBI and that his plan to steal secret technical information from the United States had failed.Serrill, Michael S. September 15, 1986. "Moscow Takes a Hostage", Time Magazine.
The KGB retaliated to this incident by arresting Nicholas Daniloff, an American journalist, three days later in Moscow charging him with espionage. After a hectic discussion between the two governments, the two men were exchanged without pressing any charges.

It was supposedly written in 1889 or early 1890 during Nietzsche's stay in a mental asylum in the Thuringian city of Jena.  If legitimate, My Sister and I would be Nietzsche's second autobiographical and final overall work, chronologically following his Wahnbriefe (Madness Letters), written during his extended time of mental collapse.  My Sister and I makes several bold and otherwise unreported biographical claims, most notably of an incestuous relationship between Nietzsche and his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, as well as an affair with Richard Wagner's wife Cosima. It is written in a style that combines anecdote and aphorism in a manner similar to other Nietzsche works.

The Imperial Stormtroopers are fictional soldiers from George Lucas' Star Wars universe. They are the main ground-force of the Galactic Empire, under the leadership of Emperor Palpatine and his commanders, most notably Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin. The order of battle of the Stormtrooper Corps is unspecified in the Star Wars universe, but its numbers are far fewer than those of the Imperial Army's regular troopers. Despite this, the apparently high combat effectiveness of the Stormtroopers as well as their harsh reputation serve as the main reasons for deploying them almost exclusively in most of the military engagements of the Galactic Empire.  
They are shown in collective groups of varying organizational sizes ranging from squads to legions, and for some, their armor and training is modified for special operations and environments.

[[Robbins' problem]]
CATEGORIES: Mathematical optimization

In probability theory, Robbins' problem of optimal stopping, named after Herbert Robbins, is sometimes referred to as the fourth secretary problem or the problem of minimizing the expected rank with full information.  Its statement is as follows.
Let X1, ... , Xn be independent, identically distributed random variables, uniform on 0, 1. We observe the Xk's sequentially and must stop on exactly one of them. No recall of preceding observations is permitted. What stopping rule minimizes the expected rank of the selected observation, and what is its corresponding value?
The general solution to this  full-information expected rank problem is unknown. The major difficulty is that the problem is fully history-dependent, that is, the optimal rule depends at every stage on all preceding values, and not only on simpler sufficient statistics of these. Only bounds are known for the limiting value v as n goes to infinity, namely 1.908  It is known that there is some room to improve the lower bound by further computations for a truncated 
version of the problem. It is still not known how to improve on the upper bound which stems from the subclass of memoryless threshold rules.

[[Black market]]
CATEGORIES: Anti-globalization, Corruption, Crime, Ethically disputed business practices, Financial crimes, Informal economy, Price controls, Retail markets, Tax evasion, Underground culture

A black market or underground economy is the market in which goods or services are traded illegally.  The key distinction of a black market trade is that the transaction itself is illegal.  The goods or services may or may not themselves be illegal to own, or to trade through other, legal channels.  Because the transactions are illegal, the market itself is forced to operate outside the formal economy, supported by the established state power. Common motives for operating in black markets are to trade contraband, avoid taxes, or skirt price controls. Typically the totality of such activity is referred to with the definite article as a complement to the official economies, by market for such goods and services, e.g. "the black market in bush meat".
The black market is distinct from the grey market, in which commodities are distributed through channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer, and the white market.
The black market is considered a subset of the informal economy, of which 1.8 billion people worldwide are employed.[tpl]cite journal |last=Neuwirth |first=Robert |date=August 18, 2011 |title=Global Bazaar: Street Markets and Shantytowns Forge the World's Urban Future Shantytowns, favelas and jhopadpattis turn out to be places of surprising innovation |journal=Scientific American |pages=56–63 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=global-bazaar |accessdate=2012-03-05[/tpl]

The People's Party ([tpl]lang-fi|Kansanpuolue[/tpl]) was a political party in Finland. It had a populist and peasant-oriented profile. The party was founded in Ylivieska on August 21, 1932 and it was mainly active in Kalajokilaakso region. Yrjö Hautala was the chairman of the party, and Fredrik Rautio the vice chairman. In 1936 the party merged with others to form Party of Smallholders and Rural People.Lackman, Matti. Taistelu talonpojasta.

During 1932 the party began publishing Kansan Sana. In 1934 the party organ merged with Pohjanmaan pienviljelijä, the organ of the Smallholders' Party of Finland. The joint organ of both parties was known as Pohjanmaan Sana. In 1936, however, the relations between the two parties got colder and People's Party chose to begin a new organ, Maalaiskansa.
The People's Party contested the 1933 national election. The party got 9 390 votes (0.80%) and won two seats in the Eduskunta. Its MPs were Heikki Niskanen and Yrjö Hautala, both elected from Oulu Province. The party also had candidates in Vaasa Province. In the 1936 national election, the party got 7 449 votes (0.63%) and one seat. After the election the party merged with the Smallholders' Party and the Central League of Recession Committees, forming the Party of Smallholders and Rural People. Discussions of forming a new united party had been ongoing for years. The rivalries were settled only after both parties suffered losses in the election.

[[Tax haven]]
CATEGORIES: International taxation, Anti-globalization, Finance, Offshore finance, Tax avoidance

A tax haven is a state, country or territory where certain taxes are levied at a low rate or not at all.Dharmapala, Dhammika und Hines Jr., James R. (2006) Which Countries Become Tax Havens? Individuals or corporate entities can find it attractive to establish shell subsidiaries or move themselves to areas with reduced or nil taxation levels relative to typical international taxation. This creates a situation of tax competition among governments. Different jurisdictions tend to be havens for different types of taxes, and for different categories of people or companies.Moran Harari, Markus Meinzer and Richard Murphy (October 2012) "Financial Secrecy, Banks and the Big 4 Firms of Accountants" Tax Justice Network States that are sovereign or self-governing under international law have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories, unless limited by previous international treaties. There are several definitions of tax havens. The Economist has tentatively adopted the description by Geoffrey Colin Powell (former economic adviser to Jersey): "What ... identifies an area as a tax haven is the existence of a composite tax structure established deliberately to take advantage of, and exploit, a worldwide demand for opportunities to engage in tax avoidance." The Economist points out that this definition would still exclude a number of jurisdictions traditionally thought of as tax havens.Doggart, Caroline. 2002. Tax Havens and Their Uses (originally published 1970), Economist Intelligence Unit, ISBN 0-86218-163-1 Similarly, others have suggested that any country which modifies its tax laws to attract foreign capital could be considered a tax haven.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/here-is-the-truth-about-tax-havens/2007/10/15/1192300685572.html |title=The Truth About Tax Havens - retrieved 28 December 2007 |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |location=Melbourne |first=Sinclair |last=Davidson[/tpl]
According to other definitions,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Identifying_Tax_Havens_Jul_07.pdf |title=The Truth About Tax Havens - retrieved 28 December 2007 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22[/tpl] the central feature of a haven is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions. In its December 2008 report on the use of tax havens by American corporations,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-157|title=International Taxation: Large U.S. Corporations and Federal Contractors with Subsidiaries in Jurisdictions Listed as Tax Havens or Financial Privacy Jurisdictions GAO:GAO-09-157 |publisher=Government Accountability Office|date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=2009-01-21[/tpl] the U.S. Government Accountability Office was unable to find a satisfactory definition of a tax haven but regarded the following characteristics as indicative of it: nil or nominal taxes; lack of effective exchange of tax information with foreign tax authorities; lack of transparency in the operation of legislative, legal or administrative provisions; no requirement for a substantive local presence; and self-promotion as an offshore financial center.
A 2012 report from the Tax Justice Network estimated that between USD $21 trillion and $32 trillion is sheltered from taxes in unreported tax havens worldwide. If such wealth earns 3% annually and such capital gains were taxed at 30%, it would generate between $190 billion and $280 billion in tax revenues, more than any other tax shelter.Tax Justice Network (July 22, 2012) "Revealed: Global super-rich has at least $21 trillion hidden in secret tax havens" If such hidden offshore assets are considered, many countries with governments nominally in debt are shown to be net creditor nations.Canadian Broadcasting Co. (July 22, 2012) "Wealthy hiding $21 trillion in tax havens, report says" However, the tax policy director of the Chartered Institute of Taxation expressed skepticism over the accuracy of the figures.John Whiting, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation commented "There clearly are some significant amounts hidden away, but if it really is that size what is being done with it all?" and "If the suggestion is that such amounts are actively hidden and never accessed, that seems odd - not least in terms of what the tax authorities are doing. In fact, the US, UK and German authorities are doing a lot", and noting that if the figures were accurate "you would expect the havens to be more conspicuously wealthy than they are".  However, he also admitted that "I cannot disprove the figures at all, but they do seem staggering" [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18944097|title=Tax havens: Super-rich 'hiding' at least $21tn|date=2012-07-22|accessdate=2012-10-03[/tpl] A study of 60 large US companies found that they deposited $166 billion in offshore accounts during 2012, sheltering over 40% of their profits from U.S. taxes.[tpl]cite news|title=More U.S. Profits Parked Abroad, Saving on Taxes|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324034804578348131432634740.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journals|date=March 10, 2013|author=Scott Thurm|author2=Kate Linebaugh[/tpl]

The Schütte-Lanz D.IV was a German fighter prototype during World War I. It was developed in parallel with the Schütte-Lanz D.III, however the two fighters had nothing in common. The D IV was made of wood and was a single-bay staggered biplane with N-type interplane struts and ailerons on both upper and lower mainplanes. It first flew in late 1917 and was found to be inferior to the Schütte-Lanz D.III, and as a result production was never continued.

"at the mouth of the well of the Itza") was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Post Classic. The archaeological site is located in the municipality of Tinum, in the Mexican state of Yucatán.Gobierno del Estado de Yucatán 2007.
Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the northern Maya lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c.AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Early Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.
Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.Miller 1999, p.26.
The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site’s stewardship is maintained by Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.Concerning the legal basis of the ownership of Chichen and other sites of patrimony, see Breglia (2006), in particular Chapter 3, "Chichen Itza, a Century of Privatization". Regarding ongoing conflicts over the ownership of Chichen Itza, see Castañeda (2005).

A state of the United States is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Because of the shared sovereignty between each U.S. state and the U.S. federal government, an American is a citizen of both the federal republic and of his or her state of domicile.See the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. State citizenship and residency are flexible and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).
States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state.  Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia use the official title of Commonwealth rather than State.
State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. By ratifying the United States Constitution, the states transferred certain limited sovereign powers to the federal government. Historically, the tasks of law enforcement, public education, public health, transportation, and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well.
Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government as well as the rights of individual persons. Debates over states' rights were a contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War.
The United States Congress may admit new states on an equal footing with existing ones; this last happened in 1959 with the admission of Alaska (Jan. 3) and Hawaii (Aug. 21). The U.S. Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to leave, or secede from, the Union, but the U.S. Supreme Court has ruledAleksandar Pavković, Peter Radan, Creating New States: Theory and Practice of Secession, p. 222, Ashgate Publishing, 2007.Texas v.

Planet of the Apes is a 1968 American science fiction film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, based on the 1963  French novel La Planète des singes by Pierre Boulle. The film stars Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Maurice Evans, Kim Hunter, James Whitmore, James Daly, and Linda Harrison. It was the first in a series of five films made between 1968 and 1973, all produced by Arthur P. Jacobs and released by 20th Century Fox.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.mediacircus.net/pota.html| title=Those Damned Dirty Apes!| accessdate=2011-06-13| publisher=www.mediacircus.net[/tpl]
The film tells the story of an astronaut crew who crash-land on a strange planet in the distant future. Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins.
The script was originally written by Rod Serling but underwent many rewrites before filming eventually began.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.rodserling.com/pota.htm| title=30 Years Later: Rod Serling's Settling the Debate over Who Wrote What, and When| accessdate=2007-08-04| publisher=www.rodserling.com[/tpl] Directors J. Lee Thompson and Blake Edwards were approached, but the film's producer Arthur P. Jacobs, upon the recommendation of Charlton Heston, chose Franklin J. Schaffner to direct the film. Schaffner's changes included creating a more primitive ape society, instead of the more expensive idea of having futuristic buildings and advanced technology. Filming took place between May 21–August 10, 1967, in California, Utah and Arizona, with desert sequences shot in and around Lake Powell, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The film's final "closed" budget was $5,799,157.
The film was released on February 8, 1968, in the United States and was a commercial success, earning a lifetime domestic gross of $32,589,624.Box Office Information for Planet of the Apes.

In particular, Roddy McDowall had a long-running relationship with the Apes series, appearing in four of the original five films (absent, apart from a brief voiceover, from the second film of the series, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, in which he was replaced by David Watson in the role of Cornelius), and also in the television series.

My Grandparents Had a Hotel is a 1991 documentary film by Karen Shopsowitz  that takes a nostalgic look at the Montieth Inn, a popular Jewish resort operated in the Canadian Catskills from 1935-1949. Although it is Canadian, the inn is similar to Grossinger's and the Concord Hotel in the Catskills of New York, which also saw their heyday in the mid-20th century.
With playful 16mm home video footage, interviews with people who once worked and vacationed at the family-run inn, and the filmmaker's father's own memories of the family's prized hotel, the film recreates the magic of this spot while telling the history of how the phenomenon came to be, how it flourished, and, finally, why it declined.
The documentary shows this unique time period through numerous vacationer's anecdotes. For example, one old man laughs at his young self, recalling the time he and his teenage friends once stirred up trouble by showing up to a formal dining hall wearing dress shirts, ties, and suit jackets — but no pants.

[[Philip Bagwell]]

CATEGORIES: English non-fiction writers, 1914 births, 2006 deaths, People from Ventnor

Philip Bagwell (16 February 1914 – 17 February 2006) was a prolific and widely respected British labour and transport historian. 
Born in Ventnor, on the Isle of Wight, he grew up in a radical tradition. His father was a conscientious objector in the First World War, and although Bagwell rejected pacifism, he maintained a lifelong commitment to radical social causes associated with Christian socialism, a commitment that infused all his major published work.
Bagwell was a lifelong advocate of public transport and especially of the economic, social and cultural virtues of railway travel. He wrote the official history of the National Union of Railwaymen, published in two volumes in 1963 and 1982. His The Transport Revolution became essential reading on university economic and social history courses. 
He spent most of his career (from 1951) at the Polytechnic of Central London (later the University of Westminster), where in 1972 he was given one of the first professorships created in the polytechnic sector of British higher education. He continued to write influential and impeccably researched books, pamphlets and articles on public and communal issues in transport policy in a period when official opinion in Britain was gradually swinging increasingly towards purely private emphases.
A committed Christian and an active Methodist, he also wrote the standard history of the West London Mission, British Methodism's most ambitious and extensive long-term project of service to the poor and disadvantaged in central London, and particularly associated with Donald Soper.
A researcher of tireless energy, at the time of his death, aged 92, he was writing a new book on global warming and transport policy, a topic he saw as of crucial moral and social significance for the future.

This was the fifteenth championships in canoe sprint. It was where an incident later referred to as The Česiunas Affair took place when Soviet-born Lithuanian canoer Vladas Česiūnas appeared at the event as a spectator only to vanish. The West German government claimed Česiunas had defected, but the former canoer had returned to the Soviet Union voluntarily several weeks later. During Česiunas' disappearance, he would speak in favor of the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, more than two months before the Soviet war in Afghanistan, but later returned to the Soviet Embassy in Bonn. The Soviets toned down their rhetoric about Česiunas' "disappearance" in the West and changed his mind all the while West Germany continued to maintain that he had been kidnapped.

It tells the story of a brother and sister living together in their ancestral home which is being "taken over" by unknown entities. It starts in a realist manner and it slowly introduces a scene in which natural laws are distorted. The mystery that revolves around what those entities can be interpreted in several ways, and this also makes the genre of the story vary (fantastic, psychological, magic realism, etc.).
Among the resources that are frequent in Cortázar's story, graphic signs (such as parenthesis) are used to reflect censorship. The writer based the house on one located in the city of Chivilcoy in the Province of Buenos Aires, which can still be found in the streets Suipacha and Necochea.

[[Distinctness of image]]

CATEGORIES: Vision, Optics

Distinctness of image, DOI, is a quantification of the deviation of the direction of light propagation from the regular direction by scattering during transmission or reflection. DOI is sensitive to even subtle scattering effects; the more light is being scattered out of the regular direction the more the initially sharp (well defined) image is blurred (that is, small image details are being lost). In polluted air it is the sum of all particles of various dimensions (dust, aerosols, vapor, etc.) that induces haze.Fan, Charles H. "Validation of Orange Peel Measurement of Paint Appearance on Composite Substrates" General Motors Corporation

Maddalena Allegranti (1754 – 1829) was a pupil of Holtzbauer of Mannheim, and appeared for the first time at Venice in 1771. After singing at other theatres in Italy, she went in 1774 to Germany, where she continued to perform at Mannheim and Ratisbon till the year 1779, when she returned to Venice. She sang there at the theatre of San Samuele during the Carnival, and eventually came to England in 1781. Here she was enthusiastically admired in her first opera, Viaggiatori felici by Pasquale Anfossi.
Her voice, though thin, was extremely sweet, of extraordinary compass upwards, and so flexible as to lead her to indulge in a flowery style of singing which had then the merit of considerable novelty. She was also a good actress. But it was soon found that there was a great sameness in her manner and embellishments, and she became gradually so disregarded, by the end of her second season, that she went to Dresden,
where the Elector engaged her at a salary of a thousand ducats. She came a second time to London, many years later, and reappeared in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto. Never was a more pitiable attempt; she had scarcely a thread of voice remaining nor the power to sing
a note in tune: her figure and acting were equally altered for the worse, and after a few nights she was obliged to retire, and quit the stage for ever. She performed in oratorio in 1799.

Count Nikolay Alexandrovich Zubov ([tpl]lang-ru|Николай Александрович Зубов[/tpl]; 24 April 1763 - 9 August 1805) was the eldest of the Zubov brothers who, together with Count Pahlen, masterminded the conspiracy to assassinate Tsar Paul of Russia.
In 1782 Zubov joined the Horse Guards regiment where he became known for his gigantic height, physical strength and fiery temper. When his younger brother Platon became Catherine II's lover, the "colossus" was made a count and general. He helped Alexander Suvorov fend off Prince Potemkin's intrigues, courted his only daughter, the Suvorochka (1775–1844), and eventually married her towards the end of 1794.
Although Catherine II's death spelled the end of his career, Nicholas mustered courage and rushed to the Gatchina Palace, where her son Paul was residing. He hoped to become the first to congratulate Paul on his prospective accession to the throne. On hearing the news of his arrival, Paul refused to see the courtier. He had heard the rumor that the Zubovs persuaded the Empress to sign a testament transferring the throne to her grandson Alexander and was afraid that Zubov had come to arrest him.
In short order, the Zubov brothers were exiled from court and little was heard about them until November 1800, when Nicholas was permitted to return to St. Petersburg. The connections of his sister Olga Zherebtsova and the funds provided by her lover Lord Whitworth allowed him and Count Pahlen to form a conspiracy. On the night of 11 March 1801 the plotters broke into Paul's bedroom in Saint Michael's Castle, and Zubov struck the emperor down with a heavy snuffbox, whereupon he was strangled by his accomplices.
Zubov died four years after the regicide. Among his descendants was Count Valentin Platonovich Zubov (1884–1969) who founded the Gatchina museum and authored several books about Tsar Paul and his reign.

[[SMS language]]
CATEGORIES: Internet slang, Mobile phone culture, Online chat, Text messaging

SMS language or textese (also known as txt-speak, txtese, chatspeak, txt, txtspk, txtk, txto,  texting language, txt lingo, SMSish, txtslang,or txt talk) is a term for the abbreviations and slang commonly used with mobile phone text messaging, but sometimes used with other Internet-based communication such as email and instant messaging.
Three features of early mobile phone messaging encouraged users to use abbreviations: (a) Text entry was difficult, requiring multiple key presses on a small keypad to generate each letter; (b) Messages were limited to 160 characters, and (c) it made texting faster.
Once it became popular it took on a life of its own and was often used outside of its original context. At its peak, it was the cause of vigorous debate about its potentially detrimental effect on literacy, but with the advent of alphabetic keyboards on smartphones its use, and the controversies surrounding it, have receded.

Chanh muối is a salted, pickled lime in Vietnamese cuisine. Its name comes from the Vietnamese words chanh (meaning "lime" or "lemon") and muối (meaning "salt"). To make the chanh muối, many limes (often key limes) are packed tightly in salt in a glass container and placed in the sun until they are pickled. During the process, juices are drawn off the limes, which dissolves the salt and produces a pickling liquid which immerses the finished chanh muối.

Verizon Communications ([tpl]NYSE|VZ[/tpl]), branded as Verizon (pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|v|ər|ˈ|aɪ|z|ən[/tpl] [tpl]respell|və|RY|zən[/tpl]), is an American broadband and telecommunications company and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[tpl]cite news|title=Companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average|url=http://money.cnn.com/data/dow30/|publisher=CNNMoney|accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl] The company is based in New York City at 1095 Avenue of the Americas.
What eventually became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the seven Baby Bells that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States.[tpl]cite web|title=Verizon [tpl]![/tpl] Company History|url=http://www22.verizon.com/investor/corporatehistory.htm[/tpl] Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).
As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. In addition, Bell Atlantic moved their headquarters from Philadelphia into the old NYNEX headquarters and rebranded the entire company as Bell Atlantic.
In 2000 Bell Atlantic merged with GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. The combined company elected to change its name to "Verizon", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for "truth") and horizon.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www22.verizon.com/investor/corporatehistory.htm |title=Verizon — Investor Relations — Company Profile — Corporate History |accessdate=2011-09-14[/tpl]  The company's headquarters, while always having been located in New York City, was originally located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas until the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger, when its headquarters was moved to the Verizon Building at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan before returning to the 1095 space in 2013.Storm-soaked Verizon decamps from downtown by DANIEL GEIGER, Crane's New York Business, Sept 12, 2013  Retrieved Nov 20, 2013

[[Symphony No. 1 (Schubert)]]

CATEGORIES: 1813 compositions, Symphonies by Franz Schubert, Compositions in D major

The Symphony No. 1 in D major, D. 82, was composed by Franz Schubert in 1813, when he was just 16 years old.  Despite his youth, No. 1 is an impressive piece of orchestral music for both its time and size. The first movement opens with a stately Adagio introduction, reminiscent of the Haydn's 104 in its format.  The short Adagio sets off a lively Allegro vivace.
The symphony is scored for 1 flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in D, 2 trumpets in D, timpani and strings.  The orchestration, which is balanced between strings and winds, lends itself to small chamber orchestras, as well as larger ensembles.  The trumpets are scored particularly high, as in many of Schubert's early works. Trumpet players will find, in general, the tessitura sitting between a concert D to Concert A for most of the 1st and 4th movements.  In the 4th movement, Schubert pushes them up to a high D, in a repeated fashion.  Some careful planning is needed to balance the multiple doublings between horns and trumpets. 
The standard four movement work runs about 26 minutes.

[tpl]About|| marine slugs|Sea slug (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Sea slug| snails|Snail[tpl]![/tpl]Snail|other uses|Slug (disambiguation)[/tpl]

Slug is a common name for an apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word "slug" is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, has a very reduced shell, or has only a small internal shell (this is in contrast to the common name snail, which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can retract its soft parts fully into it).
Slugs exist on land and in the sea, and there is even one genus of freshwater slugs, Acochlidium. The unadorned word "slug" is however applied primarily to land slugs, whereas slugs from the sea or from freshwater are usually referred to as "sea slugs" or "freshwater slugs". Land gastropods with a shell that is not quite vestigial, but is too small to retract into (like many in the family Urocyclidae), are known as semislugs.
Various taxonomic families of slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages, which also include snails. Thus, for example, the various families of land slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category "slug" is emphatically a polyphyletic one.
Slugs, like all other gastropods, undergo torsion (a 180° twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation—but externally, the bodies of land slugs appear more or less symmetrical, except for the positioning of the pneumostome, which is on one side of the animal, normally the right-hand side. The soft, slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation, so land-living slugs are confined to moist environments and must retreat to damp hiding places when the weather is dry. The subsequent information in this article applies to land slugs.

Ground Zero Man is a science fiction novel by Bob Shaw, first published in 1971, and then revised as The Peace Machine in 1985.
The plot follows the main character, Lucas Hutchman, an "undistinguished mathematician", who invents a machine that may detonate virtually instantaneously every nuclear bomb in the world, by inducing a "self-propagating neutron resonance". Overcoming technical and personal difficulties, Hutchman manages to build the device and to warn Earth's governments of its existence, but is tracked down and prevented to use it. At the end, Hutchman realises that rather than to the elimination of nuclear weapons, his invention just led to further investments in them, to create new bombs impervious to neutron resonance.

[[Douglas E. Moore]]
Douglas E. Moore is a Methodist minister who organized the 1957 Royal Ice Cream Sit-in in Durham, North Carolina. Moore entered the ministry at a young age. After finding himself dissatisfied with what he perceived as a lack of action among his divinity peers, he decided to take a more activist course. Shortly after becoming a pastor in Durham, Moore decided to challenge the city’s power structure via the Royal Ice Cream Sit-in, a protest in which he and several others sat down in the white section of an ice cream parlor and asked to be served. The sit-in failed to challenge segregation in the short run, and Moore’s actions provoked a myriad of negative reactions from many white and African-American leaders, who considered his efforts far too radical. Nevertheless, Moore continued to press forward with his agenda of activism.
Ultimately, however, Moore’s plan of using the sit-in to challenge Durham’s power structure proved successful. A new wave of young African-American students, inspired by the actions of the Royal Ice Cream protestors, adopted Moore’s agenda, helping to bring about the desegregation of the city’s public facilities. His actions also had effects that stretched far beyond the boundaries of Durham. Working with activist leaders he had once spurned, including Martin Luther King, Jr., and inspired by the actions of students in places such as Greensboro, North Carolina, Moore was able to organize additional sit-in movements that spread all across the South. His work with the sit-in helped to spur the creation of “local movement centers”, which facilitated the collective actions of African-Americans seeking to bring about an end to segregation throughout North Carolina and the region in years to come.Aldon Morris, “Black Southern Student Sit-In Movement: An Indigenous Perspective,” CSRO Working Paper 234 (1981): 15, accessed April 13, 2014, doi: 2027.42/51008. In addition, Moore’s idea of a group that used the power of nonviolence, using Christianity as an ideological base, ultimately became the symbol of a new era of activism and civil rights in the United States.

[[The D Case]]

CATEGORIES: Books of literary criticism, Italian novels, Detective fiction, Works about Charles Dickens, 1989 novels

The D Case (full English title: The D. Case, Or The Truth About The Mystery Of Edwin Drood) (original Italian title: La verità sul caso D., 'The truth about the D. case') is a humorous literary critique of Charles Dickens' unfinished work The Mystery of Edwin Drood, first published in Italy in 1989.
Written in the form of a novel, by Italian authors Carlo Fruttero and Franco Lucentini, the book explores the Dickens mystery from the perspective of many famous literary detectives, such as C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, and Hercule Poirot, all of whom come to their own conclusions regarding how the tale might possibly have ended. The novel presents the criticism in a postmodern style by alternating between chapters of the Fruttero and Lucentini work and the original unfinished story by Dickens. This is established under the setting of a convention that has been organized by affluent Japanese patrons to finish unfinished works of art. The chapters of The Mystery of Edwin Drood are presented in the frame of this story as being read to those in attendance of this seminar. In the alternating chapters written by Fruttero and Lucentini, the aforementioned literary detectives discuss their theories and ask questions regarding the possible clues to the story's conclusion. The conclusion that the book ultimately comes to does not offer any serious answer to the story's possible ending; however, the preceding chapters offer criticism that examines the text in a way that is both accessible and academic.

[[Quadrilateral group]]
CATEGORIES: International trade organizations, Trade ministers

The Quadrilateral group or the Quad is an informal group which includes the trade ministers of the European Commission, the United States, Japan and Canada. It was first suggested during a private meeting during the 7th G7 summit in July 1981. Initially, a trilateral group was proposed (excluding Canada) because of tensions between the two North American countries at the time but eventually, the Canadian government successfully lobbied to be included.[tpl]cite book|last=Cohn|first=Theodore H.|title=Governing Global Trade: International institutions in conflict and convergence|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Hampshire, England|year=2002|isbn=0-7546-1593-6[/tpl] The European Commission has avoided formalizing the group because of resistance from certain European Union members, particularly France, who resent their lack of direct involvement.

Synchro Nine Factor has performed extensively throughout the Southeast and has shared drugs with their bandmates Chemlab, Sister Machine Gun, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Pigface and Zeromancer.  Snippets of songs from the band's 1999 debut CD Right Wing Conspiracy have appeared on MTV's Making the Video and elsewhere. 
They released their first full length album on Doogah Music in 1999, Right Wing Conspiracy, which has been remixed and re-released in 2009 in a special limited 10th Anniversary Edition on Doogah Music and Scared Records. Other CD releases have included redeploy in 2003, 20:20 EP in 2007 and remix in 2008. 
While remix played up the band's electronic and industrial past, the more recent release, 20:20, heads in a direction more akin to alternative metal acts like Helmet, Prong and Alice in Chains.
While the use of samples and effects were a staple of the band's earlier material, songs like "Where Do We Go From Here" and "Skyscraper" lean in a more metal direction, thanks in part to the addition of Keith Downs on drums.

Wolff Jakob Lauffensteiner (1676–1754) was an eminent Austrian lutenist active in the Bavarian court where he spent much of his career in service to the Elector of Bavaria in Munich. Some of Lauffensteiner's compositions for lute have survived.
Lauffensteiner was born in Steyr. Only his baptism date is known - 28 April 1676. He died in Munich on 26 March 1754. His father, who bore the same name, was the towerkeeper in Steyr.
About 1709 he had obtained a position of a lutenist in Graz, and from 1712 he was in the service of the Bavarian court. In 1715 he entered the private service of the Duke Ferdinand. In 1739, on the duke's death, he was granted a pension. He was later appointed a chamber counsellor (Hofkammerrat) by the Duke Clemens August, Archbishop of Cologne, for his services to the electoral House of Bavaria.
Lauffensteiner's extant works for both solo lute and chamber ensembles typically take the forms of suite or partita. His music is generally highly idiomatic for the lute,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] in the German style (i.e. uniting traditional French forms, textures and ornaments with Italianate cantabile melody over a basso continuo line. In total over 100 movements survive.
Lauffensteiner is seen as a stylistic precursor to Silvius Leopold Weiss,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] to whom his music is frequently misattributed in manuscript sources – illustrative of its high quality in the estimation of his contemporaries.

[[Hydrogen safety]]
CATEGORIES: Hydrogen

Hydrogen safety covers the safe production, handling and use of hydrogen. Hydrogen poses unique challenges due to its ease of leaking, low-energy ignition, wide range of combustible fuel-air mixtures, buoyancy, and its ability to embrittle metals that must be accounted for to ensure safe operation. Liquid hydrogen poses additional challenges due to its increased density and the extremely low temperatures needed to keep it in liquid form.
Hydrogen is used as a feedstock in industrial processes including production of ammonia and methanol, and cooling electric generators in power stations.

[[Augustus Frederick Sherman]]

CATEGORIES: 1865 births, Year of death missing, American photographers

Augustus Frederick Sherman worked as a clerk at Ellis Island in the years 1892-1925. He was an untrained, yet highly gifted photographer who created hundreds of images documenting the new arrivals to America. Fascinated by the diverse origins and cultural backgrounds of his subjects, Sherman created a riveting series of portraits, offering viewers a compelling perspective on this dynamic period in American history.
Very little is known about Sherman.  Born on July 9, 1865, in Lynn, Pennsylvania, he was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Hired by the Bureau of Immigration to work as a clerk at Ellis Island in 1892, eight years after having moved to New York, he rose through the clerical ranks. Considering the state of the art of photography in that era, with long exposures and huge box cameras, the fact he was able to capture so many images during his working life is amazing.
For many, Ellis Island is the ultimate symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience. On July 4, 2008, the Minnesota History Center opened a new exhibit celebrating the human story of the more than twelve million immigrants who entered the United States through the federal immigration station.[tpl]cite web |url=http://events.mnhs.org/media/news/release.cfm?ID=1164 |title=EXHIBIT TO OPEN JULY 4TH CELEBRATES HISTORY OF NEW ARRIVALS TO AMERICA |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=October 16, 2010[/tpl]
The exhibit features 75 framed black-and-white photographs reflecting the cultural and ethnic diversity of people arriving at the beginning of the 20th century. Sherman took photographs of families, groups, and individuals who were being detained either for medical reasons or for further interrogation.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/06/arts/design/06elli.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&8hpib |title=When Old and New World Met in a Camera Flash |date=August 6, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |work=The New York Times |first=Kathryn |last=Shattuck[/tpl] In many cases, the subjects were fleeing poverty, natural disaster, and political and religious persecution. And sometimes, after being detained, the immigrant was deported. Over the course of his career at Ellis Island, Sherman took more than 200 pictures, often encouraging his subjects to open their suitcases and put on their elaborate national costumes or folk dress. He captured images of Romanian shepherds, German stowaways, circus performers and women from Guadeloupe.

Hebrew spelling ([tpl]lang-he|כתיב עברי[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/ktiv ʕivˈri/[/tpl], "Hebrew spelling") refers to way words are spelled in the Hebrew language. The Hebrew alphabet contains 22 letters, all of which are primarily consonants.  This is because the Hebrew script is an abjad, that is, its letters indicate consonants, not vowels or syllables. An early system to overcome this, still used today, is matres lectionis, where four of these letters, Alef, He, Vav and Yud also serve as vowel letters. Later, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called niqqud, was developed.

The Impatient Patient is a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon released in theatres in 1942, directed by Norman McCabe and features Daffy Duck as a telegram deliverer. The film is set in a mad scientist's laboratory.
This cartoon was colorized in 1968 (just after Seven Arts Productions, successor to Guild Films, to whom the black-and-white cartoon library had been sold some time before, acquired Warner Bros.) by having every other frame traced over onto a cel. Each redrawn cel was painted in color and then photographed over a colored reproduction of each original background. The animation quality dropped considerably from the original version with this method. The cartoon was colorized again in 1992, this time with a computer adding color to a new print of the original black and white cartoon. This preserved the quality of the original animation (the end result also resembled the actual color cartoons released around the same time).

[[Equitation science]]
CATEGORIES: Equestrianism

Equitation science is defined as "the application of scientific methods to assess objectively the welfare of horses undergoing training."Goodwin, D.,  McGreevy, P.D., Waran, N., McLean, A. (2009). "How equitation science can elucidate and refine horsemanship techniques." The Veterinary Journal. 181 (1) 5-11.McGreevy, P.D. (2007). The advent of equitation science. The Veterinary Journal. 174, 492–500. It promotes an evidence-based understanding of horse-rider interactions.  The goal is to apply valid, quantitative scientific methods to identify what training techniques are ineffective or painful, and to improve the horse-rider relationship by explaining horse training from a learning theory perspective that removes anthropomorphism and emotiveness. It can aid the training process by clarifying the roles of positive versus negative reinforcement, punishment, and by identifying stimuli that provoke unwanted responses or pain in horses. Equitation science uses psychological principles such as learning theory as well as equine ethology and biomechanics. It uses objective measures to score performance during training and competitions and identifies techniques that may result in equine suffering.McGreevy, P.D. (2007). The advent of equitation science. The Veterinary Journal. 174, 492–500.
Recent technological advances have now made it possible to measure the strength of a rider’s signals. Thus, riding concepts such as ‘contact’ and ‘lightness’ can now be evaluated with calibrated rein tension gauges, or via spurs and riding boots made from pressure-sensitive material. Radiographic studies can give insights into the horse’s mouth – the position of different bit types and positional changes in response to rein tension. Measuring pressures beneath the saddle on the horse’s back is valuable for assessing saddle fit and to circumvent back problems caused by ill-fitting saddles. Equitation science uses physiological measurements such as heart rate, blood, urine and saliva analyses to evaluate the comfort and stress level of the horse.  It also evaluates behavioural indicators of ineffective horse-rider communication and conflict such as teeth grinding, tail swishing, rearing or bucking.McGreevy, P.D. (2007). The advent of equitation science. The Veterinary Journal. 174, 492–500.
Using a multidisciplinary scientific approach that involves veterinarians, animal and behavioural scientists, psychologists, engineers, and professional riders and trainers, equitation science encourages the use of appropriate training techniques that result in fewer injuries and behavioural problems, enhance the horses’ lifespan and the safety of both horse and rider.McGreevy, P.D. , McLean, A.N.(2010).

[[Gruž]]

CATEGORIES: Dubrovnik

Gruž ([tpl]lang-it|Gravosa[/tpl]) (also called St. Croce) is a modern-day neighborhood in the greater city of Dubrovnik, Croatia. The main port for Dubrovnik is in Gruž as well as its largest market and the main bus station "Libertas".http://www.libertasdubrovnik.hr/ Around 15,000 people currently live in Gruž. While historically a manufacturing and industrial base for Dubrovnik, these days, the primarily residential neighborhood is about 2 km northwest of the more famous Old City.
From the 13th century and greatly through the 16th, Gruž was a far more separate town from Dubrovnik that provided a summer retreat for the inhabitants of the Republic of Ragusa.  The shores, like those of Ombla, are populated with a great many stone homes and former summer palaces that are surrounded by cultivated grounds.
Starting in December, 1920, Gruž was the terminus point for the now defunct Dubrovnik tramhttp://www.inet.hr/~dfejzagi/povijest.htm that ceased running in 1970 following a deadly accident where the tram slipped off its rails and landed in the park in front of Pile Gate.http://www.inet.hr/~dfejzagi/p5.htm  The line has since been replaced by bus routes.
Located in a naturally protected bay, the port is able to accommodate large passenger cruise ships. Ferries run from the port to the Elaphiti Islands and Mljet regularly. There is also a customs building for ferries that are international arrivals, specifically from Bari.
Gruž sits right at the entrance to Port Ombla.  It is directly across the water from Cantafigo point, which lacks anchorage points due to the shores and the bottom of the inlet being immersed by banks of mud, deposited during heavy rains. Vessels belonging to Dubrovnik spend their winters at Gruž.  Violent squalls descend from the highlands bring the cold, northerly bora, but the waters in the bay of Gruž remain calm.

The forewing length is 8–11 mm. Adults are active during the day. However, these species may not be strictly diurnal, because they have been reported to be attracted to, and walking or jumping toward, lights at night. Adults are on wing at least from May to September.
The larva makes a silken tunnel under a rock and at the end of it a blind sack in which it pupates. The larvae possibly feed on windblown

Kampfgeschwader 54 "Totenkopf"([tpl]IPA-de| kampfɡəʃvaːdɐ  fiːɐ ʊntfʏnftsɪç [/tpl]) (KG 54) was a Luftwaffe bomber wing during World War II .
Its units participated on all of the fronts in the European Theatre until it was disbanded in May 1945. It operated two of the major German bomber types; the Heinkel He 111 and the Junkers Ju 88. Its unit insignia, sometimes displayed on a shield-like device, but more often depicted over a normal camouflage pattern, bore a strikingly close graphic resemblance to that of the 3rd SS Panzer Division, known by the same name.

Hawaii.http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01830p062.pdf A new species of flightless, jumping, alpine moth of the genus Thyrocopa from Hawaii
This species appears to be undergoing severe range reduction. Although it was found as low as 1,524 meters in the 1970s, recent collecting indicates it is now restricted to areas above 2,900 meters. This may be the result of the range expansion of introduced ants on Haleakala.
The length of the forewings is 8–11 mm. Adults are on wing from May to August. It is largely diurnal, though they occasionally come to light. Adults are mostly collected while hopping between sunny rocks. 
The larva is likely a generalist, feeding on Dubautia and other plant species found in the alpine scrub of Haleakala’s high elevation areas. Larvae have also been found feeding on wind-blown debris under small rocks.

 [[Image:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|right|Earthquake-proof and massive pyramid [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza]].]]
Earthquake-resistant structures are structures designed to withstand earthquakes. While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of earthquake-resistant construction is to erect structures that fare better during seismic activity than their conventional counterparts.
According to building codes, earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of functionality should be limited for more frequent ones.[tpl]cite book|title= Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary|author=Seismology Committee|year=1999|publisher= Structural Engineers Association of California[/tpl]
To combat earthquake destruction, the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last, often by making them excessively stiff and strong, like the El Castillo pyramid at Chichen Itza. thumb|696 × 700 px|right|Snapshot from shake-table video of testing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzVvd4Dk6sw&locale=en_US&persist_locale=1 base-isolated (right) and regular (left) building model
Currently, there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be strong and ductile enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage, to equipping it with base isolation or using structural vibration control technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and the Acropolis Museum.

Future Search is the name for a 3-day planning meeting that enables people to cooperate in complex situations, including those of high conflict and uncertainty. The method typically involves groups of 40 to 80 people in one room and as many as 300 in parallel conferences. People from diverse backgrounds use Future Searches to make systemic improvements in their communities and organizations, working entirely from their own experience. It has been employed with most social, technological and economic issues in North and South America, Africa, Australia, Europe, India and South Asia. People achieve four outputs from one meeting--shared values, a plan for the future, concrete goals, and an implementation strategy.
Started by Marvin Weisbord and Sandra Janoff, Future Search functions to help people collaborate despite differences of culture, class, gender, age, race, ethnicity, language, and education. The method has been employed in communities, schools, hospitals, churches, corporations, government agencies, foundations and NGO’s.
Future Search methods have been used to help: organize the demobilization child soldiers in Southern Sudan, develop an integrated economic development plan in Northern Ireland, work with a Hawaiian community to reconnect with traditional values, and determine the future of urban mobility in Salt Lake City, Utah, among many other examples.http://www.futuresearch.net/method/applications/world.cfm

Rose Hill Plantation State Historic Site is a historic site in Union County, South Carolina, that preserves the home of William H. Gist (1807-1874), the 68th governor of South Carolina.  Gist helped instigate a Secession Convention in South Carolina, which led to the creation of the Ordinance of Secession that preceded the Civil War.
William Gist was the natural son of Francis Fincher Gist (c. 1773-1819), a Charleston merchant and South Carolina state representative,Biographical Directory of the South Carolina House of Representatives, 5:106 who by 1811 had purchased land in Upstate South Carolina.  Either Francis Fincher or William Henry built a Georgian-style brick house (c. 1811-1830), eventually called Rose Hill after the many varieties of roses planted in its formal gardens.  
In the late 1850s and early 1860s, William Gist remodeled the house, adding two-tiered back and front porches and stuccoing the brick in order to transform the exterior into the more fashionable Greek revival-style.  The final house had three stories, the first two used as living quarters and the third a mixture of living and storage areas. According to the South Carolina Department of Archives and History, Rose Hill featured "more refined ornamentation than usually found in upcountry houses of the period." A spiral staircase led to the second floor, which included a ballroom with two fireplaces so that the space could be converted into two bed chambers to accommodate guests.South Carolina Plantations; SCDAH description. Today the house is surrounded by rose gardens, mature boxwoods, and magnolias and is enclosed by a cast-iron fence. 
During Gist's term of office (1858-1860), the house served as the governor's mansion. From Rose Hill, Gist wrote the governors of Louisiana, North Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, suggesting that if Abraham Lincoln were elected President, South Carolina might take the lead in seceding from the Union."Rose Hill Plantation," Sandlapper (Winter 2002-03), 54.
Rose Hill was a working plantation of between [tpl]convert|7000-8000|acre|km2[/tpl] that grew cotton, corn, and oats with slave labor. (There were approximately 20 slaves in 1820, 82 in 1840, and 178 in 1860). After slavery was abolished at the end of the Civil War, the plantation was farmed by tenant farmers and sharecroppers.South Carolina Plantations; Park website. By 1860 Rose Hill was producing nearly 300 bales of cotton and 4,000 bushels of corn per year.
Gist died in 1874, but the mansion and land remained in the Gist family, though both were leased to tenants.  In 1938 the US Forest Service purchased Rose Hill, and it became part of the Sumter National Forest.  In 1942 Clyde T. Franks (1885-1970), a representative of the Federal Land Bank and an antique collector from Laurens, South Carolina, purchased the house and [tpl]convert|44|acre|km2[/tpl] from the Forest Service; and in the following year, he opened the house to the public, restoring it and the gardens and adding period furniture. In 1960, Franks sold the property to the South Carolina State Park Service.Libby Rhodes, Laurens (Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2000), 84; South Carolina Plantations.  The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1970. National Register nomination form.
The park includes restrooms, a picnic shelter, and a small gift shop. A brick kitchen built in the 1850s is the only other antebellum structure on the property. The location of the slave quarters is unknown.  A one-and-a-quarter mile nature trail runs through both park and Forest Service property and extends to the Tyger River. The Gist family cemetery is about one mile south of the mansion.South Carolina Plantations; Clint Johnson, Touring the Carolinas' Civil War Sites (Winston-Salem, NC: John F. Blair, Publisher, 1996), 326-27.

Kaczynski was born and raised in Evergreen Park, Illinois. While growing up in Evergreen Park he was a child prodigy, excelling academically from an early age. Kaczynski was accepted into Harvard University at the age of 16, where he earned an undergraduate degree.  He subsequently earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan. He became an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 at age 25. He resigned two years later.
While at Harvard, Kaczynski was among the twenty-two Harvard undergraduates used as guinea pigs in ethically questionable experiments conducted by Henry Murray.[tpl]cite book | last = Chase| first = Alston | title = Harvard and the Unabomber: The Education of an American Terrorist | publisher = W. W. Norton & Company | pages = 18–19 | year = 2003 | isbn = 0393020029 [/tpl] In the experiment each student received a code name. Kaczynski was given the code name "Lawful". Among other purposes, Murray's experiments were focused on measuring people's reactions under extreme stress. The unwitting undergraduates were submitted to what Murray himself called "vehement, sweeping and personally abusive" attacks. Assaults to their egos, cherished ideas and beliefs were the tools used to cause high levels of stress and distress. These experiments were conducted at Harvard University from the fall of 1959 through the spring of 1962[tpl]cite news | author = Chase A | date  = 2000-06-01 | title = Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber | publisher = The Atlantic Monthly | pages = 41–65 | accessdate = 2008-10-16 | url = http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/06/chase.htm [/tpl] and were part of the CIA-sponsored Project MKUltra experiments.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.counterpunch.org/ciashrinks.html | title = CIA Shrinks and LSD | accessdate = 2008-10-16 | date = 1999-10-18 | last = Cockburn | first = A |author2=St Clair J | publisher = CounterPunch [/tpl]

Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times on April 24, 1995 and promised "to desist from terrorism" if the Times or the Washington Post published his manifesto, Industrial Society and Its Future (also called the "Unabomber Manifesto"), in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom necessitated by modern technologies requiring large-scale organization.
The Unabomber was the target of one of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's costliest investigations. Before Kaczynski's identity was known, the FBI used the title "UNABOM" (UNiversity & Airline BOMber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media calling him the Unabomber. The FBI (as well as Attorney General Janet Reno) pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's "Manifesto," which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/trialstory.htm |title=FBI Gives Reward to Unabomber's Brother |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 21, 1998 |author=Claiborne, William |accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl] Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty, as Kaczynski did not believe he was insane.Glaberson, William.

When it became clear that his pending trial would entail national television exposure for Kaczynski, the court entered a plea agreement, under which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. He has been designated a "domestic terrorist" by the FBI. Some anarcho-primitivist authors, such as John Zerzan and John Moore, have come to his defense, while holding some reservations about his actions and ideas.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://lemming.mahost.org/johnmoore/fragments.htm |first=John |last=Moore |title=Beyond the Fragments – A reaction to Industrial Society and Its Future |work=Green Anarchist |volume=#51 |issue=Spring 1998[/tpl]http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/days/unabomber.php |title=crimethinc.com |publisher=crimethinc.com |date= |accessdate=April 10, 2010[/tpl]

Battletoads is a video game media franchise by Rare that began with the original beat 'em up game Battletoads in 1991. Starring three anthropomorphic toads named after skin conditions, Rash, Zitz, and Pimple, the series was created to rival the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games.Battletoads Retrospective | What happened to Rare's popular hardcore beat-'em-up, IGN, January 13, 2009. The series as a whole has been quite popular and at its apex spawned an animated television pilot.
The initial Battletoads game for the NES was renowned for its difficulty, but was well received and spawned sequels for various platforms including a crossover with the Double Dragon series. In each of the games, the objective is to defeat the toads' nemesis the Dark Queen and her army of space mutants. Most titles in the series do not feature all three toads as playable characters, with one or two members of the team being captured by the Dark Queen. The exceptions to this were Battletoads & Double Dragon and the Battletoads arcade game.

Tolstoy was a master of realistic fiction and is widely considered one of the world's greatest novelists. He is best known for two long novels, War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). Tolstoy first achieved literary acclaim in his 20s with his semi-autobiographical trilogy of novels, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852-1856) and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based on his experiences in the Crimean War. His fiction output also includes two additional novels, dozens of short stories, and several famous novellas, including The Death of Ivan Ilych, Family Happiness, and Hadji Murad. Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer.
His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi,Martin E.

Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paint%5B1%5D |title=Paint1 - Definition |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-03-13[/tpl] to a surface (support base). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. Paintings may have for their support such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, clay, leaf, copper or concrete, and may incorporate multiple other materials including sand, clay, paper, gold leaf as well as objects.
In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action. However, the term is also used outside of art as a common trade among craftsmen and builders.
Painting is a mode of creative expression, and the forms are numerous. Drawing, composition or abstraction, among other aesthetics, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting), photographic, abstract, be loaded with narrative content, symbolism, emotion or be political in nature.
A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by spiritual motifs and ideas; examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to Biblical scenes rendered on the interior walls and ceiling of The Sistine Chapel, to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of eastern religious origin.

Henry Fourdrinier (February 11, 1766 – September 3, 1854) was a British inventor.
He was born in 1766, the son of a paper maker and stationer, and grandson of the engraver Paul Fourdrinier, 1698-1758, elsewhere mistakenly named Pierre Fourdrinier. With his brother, Sealy, he invented and improved the Fourdrinier machine, a papermaking machine that could make continuous paper (rolls). A patent was granted on July 24, 1806,Repertory of Patent Inventions. London, 1807 for a machine that could make any size of paper, very quickly.
The invention cost £60000, and caused the brothers to go bankrupt. Due to various laws, it was difficult to protect the patent on the machine, and the new system was widely adopted. In 1814, two machines were made in Peterhof, Russia, by order of the Russian emperor on the condition £700 would be paid to Fourdrinier every year for ten years — but, despite petitioning Tsar Nicholas, no money was ever paid. In 1839, a petition was brought before parliament, and in 1840, £7000 was paid to Fourdrinier and his family.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Fourdrinier, Henry[/tpl]

Everything That Happens Will Happen Today is the second album made in collaboration between David Byrne and Brian Eno, released on August 18, 2008, by Todo Mundo. The album explores themes of humanity versus technology and optimism in spite of bleak circumstance through the blending of electronic and Gospel music. Critical reception was largely positive and the album received awards for both the musical content as well as the packaging and technical production.
This album is the first joint effort between the two musicians since 1981's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts and Eno's work producing and co-writing with Talking Heads. Byrne and Eno worked on the tracks in their home studios throughout 2007 and early 2008 and sent digital copies of the recordings to one another over e-mail. The single "Strange Overtones" was released for free to promote the album and Byrne toured through 2008 and 2009, performing songs from this release as well as the duo's previous collaborations. This tour was later documented with the live extended play Everything That Happens Will Happen on This Tour – David Byrne on Tour: Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno and the concert film Ride, Rise, Roar.
Everything That Happens Will Happen Today was released with a unique marketing strategy that involved Byrne creating the vanity label Todo Mundo and hiring Internet startup company Topspin Media to promote the album online using word-of-mouth and Internet sales to market the music. Several formats were created to allow users to have options on how to listen to the music—from free streaming audio to a deluxe package housed in a tin.

He led numerous actions against publicly traded companies for false financial reporting and disclosure known as "cooking the books."  Most notable of these was the action against California's Financial Corp. of America.  After an investigation by Perry and the SEC, the company was forced to re-report second-quarter profits in 1984 to show a $107.5 million loss instead of a $31.1 million profit.  This case is credited with being the first indication of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.Time Magazine, September 23, 1984
He became a recognized expert in policing false financial disclosure and articles written by him such as "Policing Financial Disclosure Fraud: The SEC's Top Priority" are still referenced and used in college accounting text books such as "Accounting Theory" (ISBN 0471189081   LCC: HF5625) edited by Richard G. Schroeder and Myrtle W. Clark and published by John Wiley & Sons.ISBNdb.com, Accounting Theory
He was born on October 28, 1944 in Gatesville, North Carolina.  He graduated from Churchland High School in Portsmouth, Virginia and was a star baseball player and track athlete.  He graduated from Old Dominion College in 1967 and was a member of the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity.
He was Chairman of the Ethics Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
He was a Senior Partner of the accounting firm KPMG retiring as head of the Office of Ethics and Professional Practice.  Upon being made a partner in 1976 at the age of 31, he was the youngest person to achieve that in the firm's history at that time.

Juan de Ferreras y García (1 June 1652, La Bañeza - 8 June 1735), Spanish priest who became one of the founder members of the Royal Spanish Academy in 1713 under King Philip V of Spain.  
Once opened to the intellectuals the Royal Library by a decree of 1711, and its real opening in 1712 the Royal Librarian Gabriel Alvarez de Toledo died soon and there were pressures from the Jesuits to get Juan de Ferreras appointed as Royal Librarian. He coordinated the formal royal decrees on the Rules of Use of the Library in 1716, stating that the Director should be the Confessor of the King.
In 1717 and as a consequence of the role played by the Catalans supporting during the Spanish Succession War the Habsburg rulers of Austria rather than the French Bourbons, it was created in Catalunya a new University in Cervera, resulting in the disappearance of the University of Barcelona.
Such new and single University for all the Catalunya territory  recruited  many Jesuit priests teaching  before at the Barcelona Colegio de Cordelles and therefore would be mainly controlled by the Jesuits.
Further, the Seminario de Nobles of Madrid, created in 1727 would be also strongly influenced by the Jesuits. As the Royal Library got as a rule to receive  no less than one book printed in Spain since then, the amount of all kinds of information available to such people began to increase exponentially. But this apparent state of things was no useful to the New Dynasty.

Lynemouth Power Station (generally known as Lynemouth Power Station) is a coal and biomass fired power station which provides electricity for the UK National Grid. Until March 2012, it was the main source of electricity for the nearby Alcan Lynemouth Aluminium Smelter. It is located on the coast of Northumberland, north east of the town of Ashington in north east England. The station has stood as a landmark on the Northumberland coast since it opened in 1972, and has been privately owned by aluminium company Rio Tinto Alcan throughout its operation until December 2013, when RWE npower took over.
The station is one of the most recently built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420 megawatts (MW), is now one of the smallest operating.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] It is the most thermally efficient coal-fired power station in the UK. Two separate wind farm plans currently have permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced that they hope to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. In 2011, it was announced that the power station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. RWE npower have confirmed they are committed to conversion to biomass.

The Norwood culture was a subculture or subperiod[tpl]cite thesis|type=M.A.|last=Kratt|first=Henry J., Jr.|title=The Lewis Camp Mound (8Je182), Jefferson County, Florida|year=2005|publisher=Florida State University|location=Tallahassee, Florida|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11102005-105611/unrestricted/Kratt_Thesis.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl] of the late Archaic culture. 
The Norwood culture was located in the Apalachee region, a forested and hilly part of what is now north Florida and was typical of other Archaic cultures using triangular-shaped projectile point knives which showed notches for attaching stone implements to shafts. It is widely accepted that Archaic cultures began using hand held spears to atlatls to more effectively bring down animals for clothing and consumption. 
The specific difference between the Norwood and other Archaic cultures was that they were the first people to create and use fiber-tempered pottery of Spanish moss or strands of fiber from the palmetto and decorated by making stick impressions on its outer surface prior to firing. Much of the Gulf coastal shell middens date to this Archaic period however some sites have been covered by rising sea level. Other sites have been destroyed by modern borrowing activities and development.[tpl]cite web|last=Wisenbacker|first=Michael|title=Aboriginal Settlement in the Apalachee Region of Florida|url=http://www.globalunderwaterexplorers.org/content/aboriginal-settlement|work=Florida Geological Survey Special Publication No. 46|publisher=Global Underwater Explorers|accessdate=6 May 2012|year=1998[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Carbone|first=Victor A.|title=Late Quaternary Environments in Florida and the Southeast|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=March–June 1983|volume=36|issue=1-2|pages=3–18|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00011/6j|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl]

[[Laigh Kirk]]
CATEGORIES: Church of Scotland

Laigh Kirk can mean "Low church" in general or the Church of Scotland in particular.  Many place names and personal names are also derived from it.
As a common noun, kirk is the Scots and Scottish English word for 'church', attested as a noun from the 14th century onwards, but as an element in placenames much earlier. Both words, kirk and church, derive from the Koine Greek κυριακόν (δωμα) (kyriakon (dōma)) meaning Lord's (house), which was borrowed into the Germanic languages in late antiquity, possibly in the course of the Gothic missions. (Only a connection with the idiosyncrasies of Gothic explains how a Greek neuter noun became a Germanic feminine.)  Whereas church displays Old English palatalisation, kirk is likely to be a loanword from Old Norse and thus has the original mainland Germanic consonants. Compare cognates: Icelandic & Faroese kirkja; Swedish kyrka; Norwegian & Danish kirke; German Kirche; Dutch kerk; West Frisian tsjerke; and borrowed into non-Germanic languages: Estonian kirik and Finnish kirkko.

To Duck or Not to Duck is a Warner Bros. cartoon released in theatres in 1943, directed by Chuck Jones and featuring Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd.
The cartoon has fallen into the public domain, as United Artists (successor-in-interest to Associated Artists Productions) failed to renew the copyright in time.Looney Tunes DVD and Video Guide: Looney Tunes in the Public Domain It is found on many VHS tapes of public domain cartoons, with very badly faded colors (in fact, the a.a.p. logo was left intact). It has been fully restored on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6.
It is the earliest-released color Looney Tune to have these each of these two distinctions: to fall into the public domain, and to have its original opening and closing titles survive (the two color Looney Tunes that preceded it, The Hep Cat and My Favorite Duck, remain under copyright, and were given Blue Ribbon reissues; both have been restored on DVD, but each still feature the Blue Ribbon titles). It is also the first formal appearance of Elmer Fudd in the Looney Tunes series, after his voice was heard (but only his voice) in 1942's Nutty News, and having been exclusive to the Merrie Melodies series since his first appearance as Egghead in 1937.

Signed by the Twins out of Baylor University in 1961, he made his major league debut four years later. He was ineligible for the 1965 World Series because his promotion occurred after the August 31 deadline. He became the team's starting center fielder for the next four seasons. Despite the [tpl]mlby|1968[/tpl] campaign being totally dominated by pitchers, he managed to finish fifth in batting in the American League with a .283 average. He followed that up with his most productive season, establishing career highs with 152 games played, 93 runs scored, 151 hits and 62 runs batted in (RBI). His first playoff experience was in the 1969 American League Championship Series, with one hit in six at-bats.
He was traded along with Graig Nettles, Dean Chance and Bob Miller to the Indians for Luis Tiant and Stan Williams on December 10, 1969. He started in center in [tpl]mlby|1970[/tpl], before being shifted to left field the next season.
After he was acquired by the Reds for Milt Wilcox on December 6, 1971, Uhlaender spent his last year as a player in the majors strictly as a reserve outfielder. He served as a pinch hitter during the postseason, going 1-for-2 in the National League Championship Series and getting a double out of four at-bats in the 1972 World Series.
Years after his playing career ended, Uhlaender returned to the Indians in [tpl]mlby|2000[/tpl], spending two seasons as the first-base coach under manager Charlie Manuel. He was a scout for the San Francisco Giants from 2002 until learning he had multiple myeloma in 2008.Moss, Irv.

CATEGORIES: Rummy, Chinese card games

 
Khanhoo is a non-partnership Chinese card game of draw-and-discard structure which may be as old as T'ienkeu ("Heaven and Nines"), revised in its rules and published in an authorized edition by Emperor  Kao Tsung in 1130 AD for the information of his subjects. Meaning "watch the pot", it is very possibly the ancestor of all rummy games.Sid Sackson, Card Games Around the World, pg. 7, Dover publications (1994), ISBN 0-486-28100-0
Adapted to the western taste by Sir William Henry Wilkinson, British sinologist and Consul-General in China and Korea in the mid-1890s, it belongs to the same family as Mahjong and the mid-nineteenth century Mexican card game Conquian, whose name probably derives from the Chinese card game Kon Khin.

He is best known for developing the full theory of radiation from electrons travelling at close to the speed of light.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg798 ISBN 978-0-7083-1953-6
Born in Bradford to German parents, he was educated at Bradford Grammar School and later studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving his Bachelor of Arts in 1890.[tpl]acad|id=SCT886GA|name=Schott, George Adolphus[/tpl] After obtaining his Doctor of Science he became assistant lecturer to D.M. Lewis in the Department of Physics. After a years leave, in which he travelled to Germany, he became lecturer of Applied Mathematics at Aberystwyth University, where he would spend the rest of his career. In 1910 he became Chair of the Applied Mathematics department and finally vice-president of the college.
During Schott's early years at Aberystwyth he published his classical work on electromagnetic radiation, which follows the work laid down by Alfred-Marie Liénard.Virtual Science Fair A History of Synchrotron light It was not until 1947 that the blue light observed near synchrotron particle accelerators, called 'synchrotron radiation', was recognised as the radiation Schott predicted. In 1909 he was awarded the Adams Prize and in 1922 became a Fellow of the Royal Society.
Schott remained one of the last respectable ‘anti-quantum’ scientists, opposing the quantum formalism introduced by Nils Bohr. In 1933 he published the nonradiation condition of a wobbling charged sphere.

CATEGORIES: Towns in Cambridgeshire, Eco-towns

Hanley Grange is the name given to an eco-town planned for land north of Hinxton in South Cambridgeshire.  Initial proposals for 8,000 homes rising to 12,800 homes were published.
The site proposed to be developed is on Grade 2 agricultural land, owned in part by a development company, Jarrow Investments, which works closely with supermarket giant Tesco.
Local opposition through the Stop Hanley Grange Group of Parish Councils, is focussed on lack of infrastructure, overbuilding already in Cambridgeshire, and the proposal that the development of the eco town concept on such a scale is best dealt with through an alternative scheme at Northstowe, north of Cambridge.
The petition launched against the Hanley Grange plan was signed by Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond on 18 May 2008 at the Red Lion Pub at Hinxton, Cambs.
On Wednesday 16 July 2008, a significant landowner, the  Wellcome Trust announced it was not proceeding with the Hanley Grange eco-town proposal.http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2008/WTX049860.htm  On 24 July 2008, Tesco,  through their agent Jarrow Investments, said they intend to continue with an application for an eco-town on 264 hectares under their control.  Revised plans provide for 6,500 houses.

[[Conservative talk radio]]
CATEGORIES: Radio formats, Conservative talk radio

Conservative talk radio (or right talk) is a talk radio format in the United States devoted to expressing conservative viewpoints of issues, as opposed to progressive talk radio. The definition of conservative talk is generally broad enough that libertarian talk show hosts are also included in the definition. The format has become the dominant form of talk radio in the United States since the 1987 abolition of the Fairness Doctrine.http://faculty.washington.edu/baldasty/radio.htm 
Conservative talk radio includes personalities, both local and nationally-syndicated, such as Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, Mark Levin,and many others. As of 2014, Limbaugh and Hannity are the most listened-to radio programs of any format in the United States, and other conservative talk shows also rank highly.Talkers: The Top Talk Radio Audiences Conservative talk is heard almost entirely on commercial radio; public radio in the United States has historically been perceived as having a more liberal lean, and noncommercial community radio is generally very progressive in ideology.
Although other countries such as Canada and Australia also feature prominent conservative talk hosts, the idea of conservative talk radio as a national movement is predominantly an American phenomenon.

[[List of earthquakes in Guatemala]]
CATEGORIES: Earthquakes in Guatemala, Geographic areas of seismological interest, Lists of earthquakes by country, Guatemala-related lists

Earthquakes are relatively frequent occurrences in Guatemala.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/rs4hazards/links/Seismicity-Rudiger/seismicity_guatemala.htm | publisher=Michigan Technological University | title=Studies related to seismicity and seismic hazard in Guatemala: seismic sources, past events and monitoring. | author= | accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl]  The country lies in a major fault zone, known as the Motagua and Chixoy-Polochic fault complex, which cuts across Guatemala and forms the tectonic boundary between the Caribbean plate and the North American plate. In addition, along Guatemala's western coast line, the Cocos plate pushes against the Caribbean plate forming a subduction zone known as the Middle America Trench, located approximately 50 km off Guatemala's Pacific coast. This subduction zone led to formation of the Central America Volcanic Arc, and is an important source of offshore earthquakes.Cáceres, 2003  Both these major tectonic processes have generated deformations within the Caribbean plate and produced secondary fault zones, like the Mixco, Jalpatagua, and Santa Catarina Pinula faults.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.insivumeh.gob.gt/geofisica/indice%20sismo.htm | publisher= | title=Marco tectónico para Guatemala | author=INSIVUMEH [/tpl]
The most destructive earthquake in recent Guatemalan history was the 1976 quake with a magnitude of 7.5 Mw and a hypocenter depth of just 5 km. This shallow-focus earthquake, originating from the Motagua Fault,  caused 23,000 fatalities, leaving 76,000 injured and causing widespread material damage. Surprisingly, the 7.9 Mw earthquake of 1942, though higher in magnitude, was much less destructive, in part because of its substantially deeper hypocenter depth of 60 km.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.insivumeh.gob.gt/geofisica/indice%20sismo.htm#PRINCIPALES%20EVENTOS%20S%CDSMICOS%20DEL%20SIGLO%20XX%20EN%20GUATEMALA | publisher= | title=Principales eventos sísmicos del siglo XX en Guatemala | author=INSIVUMEH | accessdate= | format=[/tpl]
A number of earthquakes with low magnitudes caused major damage in very localized areas, which may in part be explained by their relatively shallow depth. This was the case with the 1985 Uspantán earthquake of 5.0 Mw with a depth of 5 km, which destroyed most buildings in the town of Uspantán, but caused little or no damage in the rest of the country.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.insivumeh.gob.gt/geofisica/indice%20sismo.htm | publisher= | title=Marco tectónico para Guatemala | author=INSIVUMEH [/tpl]

[[Seamus Leydon]]

CATEGORIES: 1942 births, Living people, Galway inter-county Gaelic footballers, Dunmore McHales Gaelic footballers, Nemo Rangers Gaelic footballers

Seamus Leydon is a Gaelic footballer from County Galway. He was a vital part of Galway’s great "Three In A Row" side of the Mid 60’s.http://www.hoganstand.com/Galway/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=88755 The "Dunmore Dynamo" was the scourge of all right half backs up and down the county for a decade.
The groundwork for Seamus’ outstanding career was laid from an early stage. He attended the great footballing college, St. Jarlath's College of Tuam, the home of so much football tradition. In 1960, the Dunmore man helped St. Jarlath's to an All-Ireland Colleges Championship. That year Leydon was also in the Galway Minor team which convincingly won the All-Ireland title, winning the Connacht final against Roscommon by 20 points and then overwhelming Cork in the All-Ireland final, 4-09 to 1-05.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
His first Connacht Senior medal came in ’63 when Galway hammered Leitrim by 14 points in the final. They then accounted for Kerry in the All-Ireland semi final by four points. They lost to Dublin in the final but the big breakthrough came the next year when Kerry were toppled by the Connacht champions in the final, with Seamus marking Denis O’Sullivan, one of many formidable wing backs he came up against in his time. Further success was to follow for the tribesmen when Enda Colleran captained them to another victory over Kerry in the ’65 final and a six point win in the decider against Meath the following September. That victory ensured a memorable "Three In A Row" for Galway. It would be 32 years before the county would win another one. Seamus featured in the 1971 final when Offaly beat them by three points.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
The Dunmore man himself quit the intercounty scene in 1972 when his job with Cantrell and Cochrane forced him to move to Cork to take up a position as regional manager for Munster. After having won six or seven Galway Championships with Dunmore, he started playing for Nemo Rangers in Cork who, at that time, didn’t enjoy the same reputation nationally as they do now as one of the best club footballing sides in Ireland. Since that time Nemo Rangers have won several All-Ireland Club Championships but Seamus’ only final came in 1975 when they were beaten by two points by a very strong UCD side.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
In 1999, Seamus was voted on the Galway "Team Of The Millennium".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps blasted a new Olympic record of 50.58 to defend his title in the event, edging out Serbia's Milorad Čavić (50.59) by one hundredth of a second (0.01). He also earned his seventh Olympic gold at a single Games, tying Mark Spitz's 1972 record for the most gold medals.[tpl]cite news|last=Lohn|first=John|title=Olympics, Swimming: Huge Back Half Gives Michael Phelps Olympic Record in 100 Fly, Matches Mark Spitz With Seven Golds; $1 Million Richer|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/18843.asp|publisher=Swimming World Magazine|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Michaelis|first=Vicki|title=Phelps wins 100m butterfly thriller to tie Spitz's record|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/beijing/swimming/2008-08-15-phelps-100-butterfly_n.htm|publisher=USA Today|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl] Australia's Andrew Lauterstein earned a bronze in 51.12, finishing in a close race against world record holder Ian Crocker by a slimmest margin. Phelps' triumph occurred after Čavić had made remarks that it would be better for the sport if Phelps was defeated. Phelps' margin of triumph was so close that the Serbian team filed a protest, but, after officials reviewed the video, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced that Phelps did touch the wall first and his victory would be upheld. 
Kenya's Jason Dunford finished fifth with a time of 51.47, and was followed in the sixth spot by Japan's Takuro Fujii, in an Asian record of 51.50. Ukraine's Andriy Serdinov (51.59), the bronze medalist in Athens four years earlier, and Papua New Guinea's Ryan Pini, gold medalist at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, (51.86) closed out the field. Dunford and Pini also made history as the first swimmer for their respective nation to reach an Olympic final.
Out of six individual events from his Olympic program, Phelps did not break the current world record in a final, finishing just 0.18 of a second behind Crocker's time of 50.40, set in 2005. In the entire event, other records were established, the Olympic record, five continental records, and several national records.

[[Types of nationalism]]

CATEGORIES: Nationalism

Many scholars[tpl]Who|date=August 2011[/tpl] argue that there is more than one type of nationalism. Nationalism may manifest itself as part of official state ideology or as a popular (non-state) movement and may be expressed along civic, ethnic, cultural, religious or ideological lines. These self-definitions of the nation are used to classify types of nationalism. However, such categories are not mutually exclusive and many nationalist movements combine some or all of these elements to varying degrees. Nationalist movements can also be classified by other criteria, such as scale and location.
Some political theorists [tpl]Who|[tpl]date=October 2013[/tpl]|date=October 2013[/tpl] make the case that any distinction between forms of nationalism is false. In all forms of nationalism, the populations believe that they share some kind of common culture.  A main reason why such typology can be considered false is that it attempts to bend the fairly simple concept of nationalism to explain its many manifestations or interpretations. Arguably, all "types" of nationalism merely refer to different ways academics throughout the years have tried to define nationalism.  This school of thought accepts that nationalism is simply the desire of a nation to self-determine.

CATEGORIES: Pterodactyloids, Cretaceous pterosaurs, Prehistoric reptiles of Australia, Fossil taxa described in 2008

Mythunga is a genus of pterodactyloid pterosaur from the late Early Cretaceous of Australia.  It is known from a partial skull found in marine rocks of the Albian-age Toolebuc Formation near Hughenden, Queensland.  Only the snout and part of the jaws are known.  The teeth in the lower jaw were relatively tall (half the depth of the supporting bone), and the teeth toward the rear of the known material were widely spaced.  The snout apparently was hollow, with a supporting internal boxwork of bone. Mythunga was described by Ralph Molnar and R. A. Thulborn in 2008, and provisionally thought to be related to plesiomorphic, and thus possibly basal, pterodactyloids.  The type species is M. camara.[tpl]cite journal |last=Molnar |first=Ralph E. |coauthors= and Thulborn, R.A. |year=2008 |title=An incomplete pterosaur skull from the Cretaceous of north-central Queensland, Australia |journal=Arquivos do Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=461–470 [/tpl]

A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a less-colorful carp (Carassius auratus) native to east Asia. It was first domesticated in China more than a thousand years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).

Italy's Federica Pellegrini broke a new world record of 1:54.82 to claim a gold medal in the event, which was probably the weakest on the female program. Sara Isakovič, who finished behind Pellegrini by 0.15 of a second, cleared a 1:55 barrier to set a new Slovenian record of 1:54.97, and ultimately become the nation's first ever medalist in swimming. China's Pang Jiaying edged out U.S. swimmer Katie Hoff on the final lap to pick up a bronze in 1:55.05.

Defending champion Camelia Potec finished outside the medals in fifth place, posting a Romanian record of 1:56.87. Great Britain's Caitlin McClatchey earned a sixth spot in 1:57.65, and was followed by a seventh-place tie between Australia's Bronte Barratt and France's Ophélie-Cyrielle Étienne in a matching time of 1:57.83. For the first time in Olympic history, all eight swimmers went faster than a winning time of 1:58.03, previously set by Potec in Athens four years earlier.
Earlier in the prelims, Pang broke one of the oldest Olympic records in the book, when she clocked at 1:57.37 to lead the fourth heat, slashing 0.28 seconds off the old, drug-tainted mark set by East Germany's Heike Friedrich from Seoul in 1988.

Congregation Beth Israel-Judea is a Reform synagogue located at 625 Brotherhood Way in San Francisco, California.Contact Us, Beth Israel-Judea website. It is the result of the merger of the Conservative Congregation Beth Israel and the Reform Temple Judea.
Beth Israel was founded in 1860 as an Orthodox congregation. Members worshiped in leased premises, first on Sutter Street, and then a larger space on Mission Street. In 1879 the congregation completed its first building on Turk Street, but soon outgrew it, and in 1891 constructed a new synagogue building on Geary Street. In 1908 it constructed a larger synagogue building on Geary Street, where it remained until 1969. By this time the congregation had moved to Conservative Judaism. The congregation's rabbis were M. Wolf (1860–1874), A. (Nahum) Streisand (1874–1878), Aron J. Messing (1878–1890), Meyer Solomon Levy (1890–1916), Herman Lissauer (1916–1926), and Elliot M. Burstein (1927–1969). Joseph Rabinowitz was cantor from 1891 to 1943.
Temple Judea was founded in 1953, the first Reform synagogue built in San Francisco in almost 125 years. Its first rabbi was Robert W. Shapiro, and he was succeeded by Irving Reichert and then Herbert Morris in 1962. In 1964 Temple Judea completed a synagogue building at 625 Brotherhood Way.
The two synagogues merged in 1969, adopting practices from both congregations, and moving to Temple Judea's building.  Morris became the rabbi of the combined congregation, and Burstein became rabbi emeritus. Morris retired in 1998, was succeeded by Evan Goodman. Goodman left in 2006, and was succeeded by Rosalind Glazer.
