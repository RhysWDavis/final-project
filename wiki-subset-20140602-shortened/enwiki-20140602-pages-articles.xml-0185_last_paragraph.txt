[[Pitch (baseball)]]
CATEGORIES: Baseball pitches, Baseball terminology

In baseball, a pitch is the act of throwing a baseball toward home plate to start a play.  The term comes from the Knickerbocker Rules. Originally, the ball had to be literally "pitched" underhand, as with pitching horseshoes. Overhand throwing was not allowed until 1884.
The biomechanics of pitching have been studied extensively. The phases of throwing include windup, early cocking, late cocking, early acceleration, late acceleration, deceleration, and follow-through.[ref]Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine. 15(1):37-40, January 2005.
Benjamin, Holly J. MD *; Briner, William W. Jr. MD +[/ref]
Pitchers throw a variety of pitches, each of which has a slightly different velocity, trajectory, movement, hand position, wrist position and/or arm angle. These variations are introduced to confuse the batter in various ways, and ultimately aid the defensive team in getting the batter or baserunners out. To obtain variety, and therefore enhance defensive baseball strategy, the pitcher manipulates the grip on the ball at the point of release. Variations in the grip cause the seams to "catch" the air differently, thereby changing the trajectory of the ball, making it harder for the batter to hit.
The selection of which pitch to use can depend on a wide variety of factors including, but not limited to, the type of hitter who is being faced; whether there are any base runners; how many outs have been made in the inning; and the current score.

[[Quebec general election, 1973]]

CATEGORIES: 1973 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1973 was held on October 29, 1973 to elect members to National Assembly of Quebec, Canada.  The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Robert Bourassa, won re-election, defeating the Parti Québécois, led by René Lévesque, and the Union Nationale (UN).
The Liberals won a large majority of the seats (102 out of 110).  The Union Nationale, which had held power up until the previous 1970 general election, was wiped off the electoral map, winning no seats.  However, UN candidate Maurice Bellemare later won a seat in a 1974 by-election. The Parti Québécois held its own, dropping only one seat (from seven to six), and despite having fewer seats, became the official Opposition, although PQ leader René Lévesque failed to win a seat in the Assembly.
The popular vote was not as lopsided as the distribution of seats would indicate.  The Parti Québécois, for instance, won 30% of the popular vote, a significant improvement over their previous showing of 23% in the 1970 election.

[[Secondary mirror]]

CATEGORIES: Mirrors

A secondary mirror (or secondary) is the second deflecting or focusing mirror element in a reflecting telescope. Light gathered by the primary mirror is directed towards a focal point typically past the location of the secondary. Secondary mirrors in the form of an optically flat diagonal mirror are used to re-direct the light path in designs such as Newtonian reflectors. They are also used to re-direct and extend the light path and modify the final image in designs such as Cassegrain reflectors.
The secondary is typically suspended by X-shaped struts (sometimes called a "spider") in the path of light between the source and the primary, but can be mounted on other types of mounts or optical elements such as optical windows, or schmidt and meniscus corrector plates. Employing secondary mirrors in optical systems causes some image distortion due to the obstruction of the secondary itself, and distortion from the spider mounts, commonly seen as cross-shaped "diffraction spikes" radiation from bright stars seen in astronomical images.

CATEGORIES: 1970 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1970 was held on April 29, 1970, to elect members of the National Assembly of Quebec, Canada. The former Legislative Assembly had been renamed the "National Assembly" in 1968. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by Robert Bourassa, defeated the incumbent Union Nationale, led by Jean-Jacques Bertrand.
The Union Nationale, which had governed Quebec through most of the 1940s and 1950s, never held power again.
This election marked the first appearance by a new party, the sovereigntist Parti Québécois, led by former Liberal cabinet minister René Lévesque. The PQ won a modest seven seats, although Lévesque was defeated in his own riding.  The PQ would later win over many of the Union Nationale's nationalist supporters, contributing to that party's demise.
Only a few months after the election, Quebec faced a severe test with the October Crisis, in which Liberal cabinet minister Pierre Laporte was kidnapped and assassinated by the Front de libération du Québec, a violent pro-independence group.

[[Quebec general election, 1966]]
CATEGORIES: 1966 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1966 was held on June 5, 1966, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada.  The Union Nationale (UN), led by Daniel Johnson, Sr, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage.
In terms of the number of seats won, the election was one of the closest in recent history, with the UN winning 56 seats to the Liberals' 50.  Generally, Quebec's first past the post electoral system tends to produce strong disparities in the number of seats won even if the popular vote is fairly close.  The Liberals won 6.5% more votes but still won fewer seats because the system favoured rural candidates.
The victory of the UN over the popular Lesage government was a surprise to many observers. Johnson's campaign was likely helped by his position that Quebec should get a better deal within the Canadian confederation, or should separate if it is unable to do so. In this sense, the forces of Quebec nationalism unleashed by the Quiet Revolution begun by Lesage may have contributed to his defeat.
The pro-independence Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale and Ralliement national obtained a combined total of just under 9% of the popular vote (but no seats).
This was the last election for the "Legislative Assembly of Quebec". Legislation was passed to replace the bicameral system of Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of Quebec with a single National Assembly of Quebec, effective December 31, 1968.
Daniel Johnson died in office in 1968, and was succeeded by Jean-Jacques Bertrand. Johnson's sons, Pierre-Marc and Daniel Jr each later served as Premier of Quebec.

[[Eastern Fleet]]

CATEGORIES: Fleets of the Royal Navy, Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II

The British Eastern Fleet (also known as the East Indies Fleet and the Far East Fleet) was a fleet of the Royal Navy which existed from 1941-1971.
In 1904 the First Sea Lord, Sir John Fisher, ordered that in the event of war the three main commands in the Far East, the East Indies Squadron, the China Squadron and the Australian Squadron, should all come under one command called the Eastern Fleet based in Singapore. The Commander-in-Chief on the China Station would then take command. During the First World War, the squadrons retained its distinct commands and 'Eastern Fleet' was used only as a general term. The three squadron structure continued until the Second World War and the beginning of hostilities with the Empire of Japan, when the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted on 8 December 1941, amalgamating the East Indies Squadron and the China Squadron.Jackson, p. 289 During the war, it included many ships and personnel from other navies, including from the The Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. With the creation of the British Pacific Fleet in 1944/1945, the Eastern Fleet became the East Indies Fleet until the end of the war, when it became the Far East Fleet and operated in all Far East areas, including parts of the Pacific Ocean.

Richard Hofstadter (6 August 1916 – 24 October 1970) was an American historian and public intellectual of the mid-20th century. Hofstadter, the DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History at Columbia University, became the "iconic historian of postwar liberal consensus", largely because of his emphasis on ideas and political culture rather than the day-to-day doings of politicians. His influence is ongoing, as modern critics profess admiration for the grace of his writing, and the depth of his insight.Geary (2007), pp. 430, 425
His most important works are Social Darwinism in American Thought, 1860–1915 (1944); The American Political Tradition (1948); The Age of Reform (1955); Anti-intellectualism in American Life (1963), and the essays collected in The Paranoid Style in American Politics (1964).  He was twice awarded the Pulitzer Prize: in 1956 for The Age of Reform, an unsentimental analysis of the populism movement in the 1890s and the progressive movement of the early 20th century; and in 1964 for the cultural history Anti-intellectualism in American Life.[tpl]Citation | last = Benét | title = Reader's Encyclopedia | edition = 4th | year = 1996 | page = 478[/tpl].

CATEGORIES: 1960 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1960 was held on June 22, 1960  to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada. It was one of the most significant elections in Quebec history, rivalled perhaps only by the 1976 general election. The incumbent Union Nationale, led by Antonio Barrette, was defeated by the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage.
The 1960 election set the stage for the Révolution Tranquille, a major social transformation of all aspects of Quebec society throughout the 1960s.  Among many other changes, the influence and power of the Catholic church fell sharply as Quebec became a secular society.
This election put an end to 16 years of continuous Union Nationale rule, much of it under Maurice Duplessis.  Duplessis had died in 1959.
His successor, Paul Sauvé, initiated a "hundred days of change" that began to transform Quebec society after a long era of conservatism under Duplessis. The Duplessis period was later derisively referred to as La Grande Noirceur (the Great Darkness).  Sauvé died suddenly after only a few months in office.  The Union Nationale was thus in disarray when it went into an election under its second new leader (Barrette) in less than a year.

The Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|n|æ|f|iː[/tpl]) is an organisation created by the British government in 1921 to run recreational establishments needed by the British Armed Forces, and to sell goods to servicemen and their families. It runs clubs, bars, shops, supermarkets, launderettes, restaurants, cafés and other facilities on most British military bases and also canteens on board Royal Navy ships. Commissioned officers are not usually supposed to use the NAAFI clubs and bars, since their messes provide these facilities and their entry, except on official business, is considered to be an intrusion into junior ranks' private lives.
NAAFI personnel serving aboard ship are part of the Naval Canteen Service (NCS), wear naval uniform and have action stations, but remain civilians. NAAFI personnel can also join the Expeditionary Force Institutes (EFI), which provides NAAFI facilities in war zones. EFI personnel are members of the Territorial Army serving on special engagements, bear ranks and wear uniform. NCS personnel can similarly volunteer to join the Royal Navy when it goes on active service. Petty Officer John Leake, NCS canteen manager in HMS Ardent, was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in the 1982 Falklands War for his courage while manning a machine gun.

The International Bridge began construction in 1960 and officially opened to traffic on October 31, 1962. Daily operation is carried on by the International Bridge Administration (IBA) under the supervision of the Sault Ste. Marie Bridge Authority (SSMBA). The SSMBA replaced the previous Joint International Bridge Authority (JIBA) in 2009, which in turn had succeeded the International Bridge Authority (IBA, created in 1935) in 2000.

[[Nazi concentration camps]]

Nazi Germany maintained concentration camps (in German Konzentrationslager, or KZ) throughout the territories it controlled. The term was borrowed from the British concentration camps of the Second Anglo-Boer War.
The first Nazi concentration camps were hastily erected in Germany in February 1933 immediately after Hitler became Chancellor and his NSDAP was given control over the police through Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick and Prussian Acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring.[tpl]harvnb |Evans|2003| pp=307- [/tpl] Used to hold and torture political opponents and union organizers, the camps held around 45,000 prisoners by 1933 and were greatly expanded after the Reichstag fire of that year.[tpl]harvnb |Evans|2005| p=81 [/tpl]
Only about 3,000 inmates remained in the camps when in 1934–35 Heinrich Himmler's SS took full control of the police and concentration camps throughout Germany. It was then that Hitler allowed Himmler to start using the camps' facilities and personnel to purge German society of so-called "racially undesirable elements" such as Jews, criminals, homosexuals, and Romani people.[tpl]harvnb |Evans|2005| pp=87–90 [/tpl]
Between 1939 and 1942 during World War II, the number of camps exploded to more than 300, as political prisoners and "undesirable elements" from across Europe were mass-incarcerated generally without judicial process.
The concentration camps were administered since 1934 by Concentration Camps Inspectorate which in 1942 was merged into SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt and were guarded by SS-Totenkopfverbände.
Holocaust scholars draw a distinction between concentration camps (described in this article) and extermination camps, which were established by the Nazis for the industrial-scale mass murder of the predominantly Jewish ghetto and concentration camp populations.

[[Dial-on-demand routing]]
CATEGORIES: Routing

Dial on Demand Routing (DDR) is a routing technique where a network connection to a remote site is established only when needed. In other words, if the router tries to send out data and the connection is off, then the router will automatically establish a connection, send the information, and close the connection when no more data needs to be sent.   DDR is advantageous for companies that must pay per minute for a WAN setup, where a connection is always established.  Constant connections can become needlessly expensive if the company does not require a constant internet connection.Dial on Demand Routing. (n.d.). .

CVCC is a trademark by the Honda Motor Company for an engine with reduced automotive emissions, which stood for "Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion".Honda Worldwide  The first mention of Honda developed CVCC technology was done by Mr. Soichiro Honda February 12, 1971, at the Federation of Economic Organizations Hall in Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo.http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1972introducingthecvcc/text05/index.html Honda's engineers at the time, Mr. Date conferred with Mr. Yagi and Mr. Nakagawa about the possibility of creating lean combustion via a prechamber, which some diesel engines utilized.http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1972introducingthecvcc/text04/index.html The first engine to be installed with the CVCC approach for testing was the single-cylinder, 300 cc Honda EA engine used in the Honda N600 hatchback in January 1970. This technology allowed Honda's cars to meet Japanese and United States emission standards in the 1970s without a catalytic converter. A type of stratified charge engine, it first appeared on the 1975 ED1 engine. As emission laws advanced and required more stringent admissible levels, Honda abandoned the CVCC method and introduced PGM-FI, or Programmed Fuel Injection on all Honda vehicles. Some vehicles in Japan had a combination of electronically controlled carburetors, called PGM-Carb on specific, transitional Honda D, E and ZC engines.
Toyota briefly used a similar technology in the mid-to-late seventies, called TTC-V. In 2007, the Honda CVCC technology was added to the Mechanical Engineering Heritage of Japan.

A(n)The use of a or an depends on whether or not herbal is pronounced with a silent h.  herbal is "a collection of descriptions of plants put together for medicinal purposes."Singer, p. 95. Expressed more elaborately — it is a book containing the names and descriptions of plants, usually with information on their virtues (properties)Arber, p. 14. — and in particular their medicinal, tonic, culinary, toxic, hallucinatory, aromatic, or magical powers, and the legends associated with them.  A herbal may also classify the plants it describes,Leyel, in Grieve. p. xiii. may give recipes for herbal extracts, tinctures, or potions, and sometimes include mineral and animal medicaments in addition to those obtained from plants. Herbals were often illustrated to assist plant identification.Anderson, p. 2.
Herbals were among the first literature produced in Ancient Egypt, China, India, and EuropeStuart, pp. 1–26. as the medical wisdom of the day accumulated by herbalists, apothecaries and physicians.Stuart, p. 7–8, 13.  Herbals were also among the first books to be printed in both China and Europe. In Western Europe herbals flourished for two centuries following the introduction of moveable type (c. 1470–1670).See Arber, 1984
In the late 17th century, the rise of modern chemistry, toxicology and pharmacology reduced the medicinal value of the classical herbal.  As reference manuals for botanical study and plant identification herbals were supplanted by Floras — systematic accounts of the plants found growing in a particular region, with scientifically accurate botanical descriptions, classification, and illustrations.Morton, pp. 115–164. Herbals have seen a modest revival in the western world since the last decades of the 20th century, as herbalism and related disciplines (such as homeopathy and aromatherapy) became popular forms of complementary and alternative medicine.See Andrews, 1982, pp. 277–296.

They became known to the general public through rodeos, horse shows, and Disney movies made for television.
For many years, Aussies have been valued by stockmen for their versatility and trainability. They have a similar look to the popular English Shepherd and Border Collie breeds. While they continue to work as stockdogs and compete in herding trials, the breed has earned recognition in other roles due to their trainability and eagerness to please, and are highly regarded for their skills in obedience. Like all working breeds, the Aussie has considerable energy and drive, and usually needs a job to do. It often excels at dog sports such as dog agility, flyball, and frisbee. They are also highly successful search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, detection dogs, guide, service, and therapy dogs.

A member of the CPC from the early 1920s, he spent time in Moscow during the early 1930s, where he learned the methods of the NKVD and became a supporter of Wang Ming for leadership of the CPC.  After returning to China in the late 1930s, Kang Sheng switched his allegiance to Mao Zedong and became a close associate of Mao during the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War and after.  He remained at or near the pinnacle of power in the People's Republic of China from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1975.  After the death of Mao and the subsequent arrest of the Gang of Four, Kang Sheng was accused of sharing responsibility with the Gang for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and  in 1980 he was expelled posthumously from the CPC.See, generally, John Byron & Robert Pack, The Claws of the Dragon: Kang Sheng - The Evil Genius Behind Mao - And His Legacy of Terror in People's China, (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1992); Zhong Kan, Kang Sheng Pingzhuan Critical Biography of Kang Sheng (Beijing: Hongqi, 1982); Lin Qingshan, Kang Sheng Waizhuan Unofficial Biography of Kang Sheng (Beijing: Zhongguo Qingnian, 1988)

The mission of the Chi Psi Fraternity is to create and maintain an enduring society which encourages the sharing of traditions and values, respect for oneself and others, and responsibility to the university and community.
Chi Psi was founded on Thursday May 20, 1841, by 10 students at Union College with the idea of emphasizing the fraternal and social principles of a brotherhood. It was the first Greek-letter organization to be founded on these grounds, rather than the literary characteristics of the seven then-existing societies. In 1845, Chi Psi was the first fraternity in the nation to establish a fraternity house. The first fraternity house was located at the University of Michigan. Thanks to the building's resemblance to a hunting lodge, Chi Psi now refers to all its houses as Lodges.The Chi Psi Story, p70  Chi Psi Fraternity is the 8th fraternity to be founded in the United States.

The number of prisoners per location ranged from more than 5,000 to only a dozen at a work site. Beginning in 1942, inmates of Neuengamme were also transported to the camp Arbeitsdorf. "Toward the ends of the war three times more prisoners were in satellite camps than in the main camp" wrote Dr. Garbe of the Neuengamme Memorial Museum.

Alvan Clark (March 8, 1804 – August 19, 1887), born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the descendant of a Cape Cod whaling family of English ancestry,http://www.nndb.com/people/702/000167201/ was an American astronomer and telescope maker.  He was a portrait painter and engraver (ca.1830s-1850s), and at the age of 40 became involved in telescope making. Using glass blanks made by Chance Brothers of Birmingham and Feil-Mantois of Paris, his firm Alvan Clark & Sons ground lenses for refracting telescopes, including the largest in the world at the time: the [tpl]convert|18.5|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] at Dearborn Observatory at the Old University of Chicago (the lens was originally intended for Ole Miss), the two [tpl]convert|26|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] telescopes at the United States Naval Observatory and McCormick Observatory, the [tpl]convert|30|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] at Pulkovo Observatory (destroyed in the Siege of Leningrad; only the lens survives), the [tpl]convert|36|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] telescope at Lick Observatory (still third-largest) and later the [tpl]convert|40|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] at Yerkes Observatory, which remains the largest successful refracting telescope in the world.  One of Clark's sons, Alvan Graham Clark, discovered the dim companion of Sirius. His other son was George Bassett Clark; both sons were partners in the firm.
Two craters bear his name.  The Clark on the Moon is jointly named for him and his son, Alvan Graham Clark,  and one on Mars is named in his honor.

The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, 26 October 1942, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Santa Cruz or in Japanese sources as the [tpl]Nihongo|Battle of the South Pacific|南太平洋海戦[/tpl], was the fourth carrier battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II and the fourth major naval engagement fought between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy during the lengthy and strategically important Guadalcanal campaign. In similar fashion to the battles of Coral Sea, Midway, and the Eastern Solomons, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in direct visual range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier or land-based aircraft.
In an attempt to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby islands and end the stalemate that had existed since September 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army planned a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal for 20–25 October 1942. In support of this offensive, and with the hope of engaging Allied naval forces, Japanese carriers and other large warships moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. Allied naval forces also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the stalemate and decisively defeating their adversary.
The Japanese ground offensive on Guadalcanal was under way in the Battle for Henderson Field while the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of 26 October 1942, just north of the Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships were forced to retreat from the battle area with one carrier sunk and another heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces, however, also retired because of high aircraft and aircrew losses plus significant damage to two carriers. Although a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, the loss of many irreplaceable, veteran aircrews would prove to be a long term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low and could be quickly replaced. The high cost of the battle for the Japanese prevented their carrier forces from further significant involvement in the Guadalcanal campaign.

[[Cursive]]

CATEGORIES: Calligraphy, Penmanship, Writing

Cursive, also known as script, joined-up writing, joint writing, running writing, or handwriting is any style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a conjoined and/or flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. However, not all cursive copybooks join all letters. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the Persian, Arabic, Latin, and Cyrillic alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke.
While the terms cursive or script are popular in the United States for describing this style of writing the Latin script, this term is rarely used elsewhere. Joined-up writing is more popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland and India.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] The corresponding Telugu word is a transliteration of "Joined-up writing." The term handwriting is common in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, the term running-writing is also popularly applied. In reference, cursive is often said to have been "written", as opposed to having been "printed" in traditional block format.
Cursive is distinct from block letters, in which the letters of a word are unconnected and in Roman/Gothic letterform rather than joined-up script. This style may also be called "printscript", "print writing", "block writing" (and sometimes simply "print").   
A distinction is also made between looped cursive penmanship, in which some ascenders and descenders of cursive have loops which provide for joins, and cursive italic penmanship, which is derived from chancery cursive, and which uses non-looped joins or no joins. There are no joins from g, j, q or y, and a few other joins are discouraged.[tpl]cite news |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518.html |title=How Handwriting Boosts the Brain |first=Gwendolyn |last=Bounds |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 5, 2010 |publisher=Dow Jones |location=New York |issn=0099-9660 |accessdate=August 30, 2011[/tpl] Italic penmanship became popular in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance. The term "italic" as it relates to handwriting is not to be confused with typed letters that slant forward. Many, but not all, letters in the handwriting of the Renaissance were joined, as most are today in cursive italic.
In Hebrew cursive and Roman cursive, the letters are not connected. In the research domain of handwriting recognition, this writing style is called connected cursive, to indicate the difference between the phenomenon of italic and sloppy appearance of individual letters (cursive) and the phenomenon of connecting strokes between letters, i.e., a letter-to-letter transition without a pen lift (connected cursive).
The origin of the cursive method is associated with practical advantages of writing speed and infrequent pen lifting to accommodate the limitations of the quill. Quills are fragile, easily broken, and will spatter unless used properly. Steel dip pens followed quills; they were sturdier, but still had some limitations. The individuality of the provenance of a document was a factor also, as opposed to machine font.Georges Jean (1997). Writing: The story of alphabets and scripts, London: Thames and Hudson Ltd.

CATEGORIES: Mythological cosmologies, Flat Earth theory, Metaphors referring to animals, Turtles

"Turtles all the way down" is a jocular expression of the infinite regress problem in cosmology posed by the "unmoved mover" paradox. The metaphor in the anecdote represents a popular notion of the myth that Earth is actually flat and is supported on the back of a World Turtle, which itself is propped up by a chain of larger and larger turtles. Questioning what the final turtle might be standing on, the anecdote humorously concludes that it is "turtles all the way down".
The phrase was used by Stephen Hawking in 1988, but has been commonly known since at least the early 20th century. A comparable metaphor describing the circular cause and consequence for the same problem is the "chicken and egg problem". The same problem in epistemology is known as the Münchhausen trilemma.

Most diplomonads are double cells: they have two nuclei, each with four associated flagella, arranged symmetrically about the body's main axis.  Like the retortamonads, they lack both mitochondria and a Golgi apparatus.  However they are now known to possess modified mitochondria, in the case of G. lambia, called mitosomes.

[[Three-striped night monkey]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals of South America, Fauna of Colombia, Fauna of Venezuela, Night monkeys, Animals described in 1811

The three-striped night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus), also known as northern night monkey or northern owl monkey, is one of several species of owl monkeys currently recognised. It is found in Venezuela and north-central Brazil.
Until 1983, all the owl monkeys were regarded as subspecies of Aotus trivirgatus, and all were referred to as douroucoulis. The use of the name douroucouli exclusively for the three-striped night monkey is not universally accepted; some authors use it for the entire genus, or for the grey-necked group of species within it (to which A. trivirgatus belongs).  
Like other owl monkeys, the three-striped night monkey lives in woodlands including rain forest. It is mainly black, with striking white markings on its face. Its body size is 27–48 cm, and its tail is about the same length again. Adults weigh up to 1 kg. It has very large eyes, and is most active on moonlit nights, feeding on fruit, nuts, leaves, insects and other small invertebrates, and birds' eggs.
The three-striped night monkey forms pair bonds which are broken only by the death of one partner. It lives in family groups, with the immature young staying with their parents until sexual maturity at the age of 3 or 4. Normally only one infant is born, after a gestation period of a little over 4 months.

[[Ticket machine]]
CATEGORIES: Tickets, Vending machines

A ticket machine, also known as a Ticket Vending Machine (TVM), is a vending machine that produces tickets. For instance, ticket machines dispense train tickets  at railway stations, transit tickets at metro stations and tram tickets at some tram stops and in some trams.  The typical transaction consists of a user using the display interface to select the type and quantity of tickets and then choosing a payment method of either cash, credit/debit card or smartcard.  The ticket or tickets are printed  and dispensed to the user.
To encourage usage of ticket machines and reduce the need for salespersons, machine prices may in some cases be lower than those at a ticket counter.
In many countries where trains and urban transport tickets operate largely on the honor system (with enforcement by roving inspectors or conductors), there are also machines in stations (or in vehicles) just for validating tickets. This is for the situation where one buys a ticket in advance and decides to use it later. Usually, the ticket is time-stamped to determine its validity period. A common problem is forgetting to validate and then being fined as if one had no ticket at all.
Ticket machines that are out of service or accept 'exact change only' result in losses for transport providers. Ticket machines on trams in Melbourne, for example, often run out of change when passengers use a higher ratio of $2 and 50c coins, depleting the ticket machine of smaller coin denominations (10c, 20c). Passengers do not need to buy tickets on trams when ticket machines run out of change.
Such machines are generally not used in the United States. Nearly all American mass transit networks operating on the honor system expect their users to buy tickets immediately before use; regular riders can avoid that inconvenience by buying period passes in advance (often from the same machines that sell daily or one-time tickets). Recently, however, a handful of regional rail systems like Metrolink, and SEPTA have adopted the use of validation machines for at least some ticket types.
Ticket machines are often used in car parking, as well as those that issue free tickets — for example, those for virtual queueing.

[[Galactosemia]]

CATEGORIES: Inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism

Galactosemia (British Galactosaemia) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder that affects an individual's ability to metabolize the sugar galactose properly. Galactosemia follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that confers a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for adequate galactose degradation.  
Friedrich Goppert (1870–1927), a German Physician,  first described the disease in 1917,[tpl]cite journal |author=Goppert F. |title=Galaktosurie nach Milchzuckergabe bei angeborenem, familiaerem chronischem Leberleiden |journal=Klin Wschr |volume=54 |issue= |pages=473–7 |year=1917 [/tpl] with its cause as a defect in galactose metabolism being identified by a group led by Herman Kalckar in 1956.[tpl]cite journal |author=Isselbacher KJ, Anderson EP, Kurahashi K, Kalckar HM |title=Congenital galactosemia, a single enzymatic block in galactose metabolism |journal=Science |volume=13 |issue=123 |pages=635–6 |year=1956 |pmid=13311516 |doi=10.1126/science.123.3198.635[/tpl]

Destination Games was an American computer game development company created in April 2000 by Richard Garriott, Robert Garriott and Starr Long, following their departure from Origin Systems. ("Destination" is a play on "Origin", the company the Garriotts founded nearly two decades earlier.)
Destination was founded in Austin, Texas to develop massively multiplayer online role-playing games. At E3 2001, Richard Garriott announced a partnership making Destination the United States headquarters of South Korean MMORPG giant NCsoft. As NCsoft Austin, Destination has mainly focused on developing and supporting the North American version of NCsoft's Lineage games.
In 2007 Destination Games released its first game, Tabula Rasa, a sci-fi MMORPG. The game did not sell as well as was hoped, Richard Garriott left NCsoft in 2008,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21052 | title=Richard Garriott Departs NCsoft Following Return To Earth | author=Remo, Chris | date=2008-11-12 |publisher=Gamasutra[/tpl] and the game service closed in February 2009.

Besom is a dialectal or historical word for what is now known as a broom, a household implement used for sweeping. 
The term "besom" is now mostly reserved for a "traditionally constructed" broom, made from a bundle of twigs tied to  a stouter pole. 
The twigs used could be broom (i.e. Genista, whence the modern name "broom" for the tool), heather or similar.  The song Buy Broom Buzzems from Northern England refers to both types of twig.  From the phrase broom besom the more common broom comes.

Circus Oz  was founded in December 1978 in Melbourne, Australia, with its first performance season in March 1978. Circus Oz was the amalgamation of two already well-known groups - Soapbox Circus, a roadshow set up by the Australian Performing Group in 1976, and the New Ensemble Circus, a continuation of the New Circus, established in Adelaide in 1974.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.circusoz.com/digitalAssets/1479_1234416397068_The%20History%20of%20Circus%20Oz.pdf |title=The History of Circus Oz by Jon Hawkes |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20[/tpl]
The founders wanted to create a modern circus without animals, but instead with elements of rock'n'roll, popular theatre and satire.  The company has an ongoing social justice agenda and have generally been open about supporting humanitarian causes. Over the years this has included women's rights, land rights for indigenous Australians and  strong feelings about the plight of asylum seekers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.circusoz.com.au |title=Circus Oz web site |publisher=Circusoz.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20[/tpl]
The most significant developmental elements in the early years of Circus Oz were the 32 week 1979 season at the Last Laugh Theatre Restaurant in Melbourne, the Chinese acrobatic master classes and the groupʼs relations with The Flying Fruit Fly Circus. Circus Oz has performed in, among many other international tours, New York City, London and  Jerusalem as part of its international touring. 
One of the very first 'new' or 'contemporary' circuses without animals, (it pre-dates Cirque du Soleil by about 6 years), Circus Oz continues to make a show with only a dozen multi-skilled performers who all perform the entire show, doing 'a bit of everything', from acrobatics and clowning to music and aerial work. The skills are high-level circus, but the show is usually comic and character-driven. The cast is a diverse mix of body shapes and ages, with an equal number of men and women. Their style is generally cheeky, anarchic and subversive, with enough strong women and graceful men.
The company have an ongoing social justice agenda and have generally been open about supporting humanist causes. Over the years this has included Women's rights, Land Rights for indigenous Australians and strong opposition to the mandatory indefinite detention of asylum seekers.
Circus Oz has performed in twenty six countries across five continents including 4 seasons on 42nd Street in New York, a number of seasons at Queen Elizabeth and Royal Festival Halls in London, a refugee camp in the West Bank, indigenous communities in the Australian desert and a glass opera house in the Brazilian rainforest. Over two million people have seen the company perform, and the show has been translated and performed in  more than a dozen languages – including Hindi, Catalan and Danish. The troupe has broken box office records at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and represented Australia at many international festivals.
The company employs a full-time ensemble of 12 performers (an equal number of men and women), plus a technical crew, production and artistic departments. 
In late 2013 Circus Oz will relocate to a custom-built Home Base  in Collingwood, an inner suburb of Melbourne. The state government of Victoria will own the facility, but it has been designed specifically to Circus Oz's requirements. This location will include a permanent Spiegeltent, large rehearsal spaces, outdoor areas, and workshop and props-making facilities.The buildings approximately half of an abandoned college campus, and there is work being done by Arts Victoria to investigate converting the remainder of the campus into an Arts Precinct, making it a vibrant multi-arts and community hub.
Apart from the core business of touring Nationally and internationally with their core ensemble, other parts of Circus Oz  include:
Blakrobatics, a programme connecting Australian Aboriginal performers and artists with the circus, including masterclasses, casting, traineeships and guest artists.
Circus Active, public circus classes for the general public, adults, schools, and community groups to learn circus skills.
The Melba Spiegeltent, a licensed venue, which will launch with a programme of cabaret, innovative performance, local community events.
A Sector Support  Programme, providing access to space for a selected series of small/medium sized local performance groups (primarily using a circus vocabulary).
High Flying Teams, a corporate team-building and training programme using circus as a skill-base for corporate training.

Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to explain human decision making, the ability to process multiple alternatives and to choose an optimal course of action. It studies how economic behavior can shape our understanding of the brain, and how neuroscientific discoveries can constrain and guide models of economics.Center for Neuroeconomics Study at Duke University http://neuroeconomics.duke.edu/research/research2.html
It combines research methods from neuroscience, experimental and behavioral economics, and cognitive and social psychology. As research into decision-making behavior becomes increasingly computational, it has also incorporated new approaches from theoretical biology, computer science, and mathematics. Neuroeconomics studies decision making, by using a combination of tools from these fields so as to avoid the shortcomings that arise from a single-perspective approach. In mainstream economics, expected utility (EU), and the concept of rational agents, are still being used. Many economic behaviors are not fully explained by these models, such as heuristics and framing.Loewenstein,G.,  Rick,S., & Cohen, J. (2008). Neuroeconomics. Annual Reviews. 59: 647-672. [tpl]DOI|10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093710[/tpl]
Behavioral economics emerged to account for these anomalies by integrating social, cognitive, and emotional factors in understanding economic decisions. Neuroeconomics adds another layer by using neuroscientific methods in understanding the interplay between economic behavior and neural mechanisms. By using tools from various fields, some scholars claim that neuroeconomics offers a more integrative way of understanding decision making.

[[Canonical form]]
CATEGORIES: Algebra, Concepts in logic, Mathematical terminology, Formalism (deductive)

In mathematics and computer science, a canonical, normal, or standard  form of a mathematical object is a standard way of presenting that object as a mathematical expression. The distinction between "canonical" and "normal" forms varies by subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a unique representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.
The canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.
More generally, for a class of objects on which an equivalence relation (which can differ from standard notions of equality, for instance by considering different forms of equal objects to be nonequivalent) is defined, a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, row echelon form and Jordan normal form are canonical forms for matrices.
In computer science, and more specifically in computer algebra, when representing mathematical objects in a computer, there are usually many different ways to represent the same object. In this context, a canonical form is a representation such that every object has a unique representation. Thus, the equality of two objects can easily be tested by testing the equality of their canonical forms. However canonical forms frequently depend on arbitrary choices (like ordering the variables), and this introduces difficulties for testing the equality of two objects resulting on independent computations. Therefore, in computer algebra, normal form is a weaker notion: A normal form is a representation such that zero is uniquely represented. This allows to test equality by putting the difference of two objects in normal form (see Computer algebra#Equality).
Canonical form can also mean a differential form that is defined in a natural (canonical) way; see below.
In computer science, data that has more than one possible representation can often be canonicalized into a completely unique representation called its canonical form.  Putting something into canonical form is canonicalization.The term 'canonization' is sometimes incorrectly used for this.

The Armed Services Committee was created as a result of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 following U.S. victory in the Second World War. It merged the responsibilities of the Committee on Naval Affairs (established in 1816) and the Committee on Military Affairs (also established in 1816). Considered one of the most powerful Senate committees, its broad mandate allowed it to report some of the most extensive and revolutionary legislation during the Cold War years, including the National Security Act of 1947.

Bill "Herman" Hamilton is an Australian former rugby league footballer of the 1960s and 70s. Known as Herman by teammates after his resemblance to Herman Munster, he played in the front row for the Manly-Warringah and North Sydney clubs in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership, winning the 1972 and 1973 premierships with the Sea Eagles. He also gained selection for the Australia on the 1973 Kangaroo Tour though he only played in eight minor matches and didn't play a test.
Surprisingly unwanted by Manly at the end of 1974, he went on to captain the North Sydney Bears, bringing much needed discipline to a club regarded as ‘easybeats’. Hamilton captain-coached the club to their last major trophy the Channel 10 Challenge Cup in 1978.

The poodle is a group of formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle (one registry organisation also recognizes a Medium Poodle variety, between Standard and Miniature), with many coat colors. Originally bred in Germany as a type of water dog, the breed was standardized in France. The poodle is skillful in many dog sports, including agility, obedience, tracking, and even herding.

[[Fisherian runaway]]

CATEGORIES: Sexual selection, Evolutionary biology, Philosophy of biology

Fisherian or Fisher’s runaway, first proposed by R. A. Fisher in the early 20th century, is a hypothesized selection mechanism for the evolution of male ornamentation (secondary sexual characteristics), observed in numerous sexually reproducing species; based upon the attraction to ornamented males through female sexual selection (female choice).Fisher, R.A. (1915) The evolution of sexual preference. Eugenics Review (7) 184:192Fisher, R.A. (1930) The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection. ISBN 0-19-850440-3Edwards, A.W.F. (2000) Perspectives: Anecdotal, Historial and Critical Commentaries on Genetics. The Genetics Society of America (154) 1419:1426Andersson, M. (1994) Sexual selection. ISBN 0-691-00057-3Andersson, M. and Simmons, L.W. (2006) Sexual selection and mate choice. Trends, Ecology and Evolution (21) 296:302Gayon, J. (2010) Sexual selection: Another Darwinian process. Comptes Rendus Biologies (333) 134:144
The evolution of male ornamentation, an example being the colourful and elaborate male peacock plumage compared to the relatively subdued female peahen plumage, represented a paradox for evolutionary biologists in the period following Darwin and leading up to the modern evolutionary synthesis; the selection for costly ornaments appearing incompatible with natural selection. Fisherian runaway is an attempt to resolve this paradox, using an assumed genetic basis for the preference and the ornament (dominance), through the less obvious but powerful forces of sexual selection (a sub component of natural selection). Fisherian runaway hypothesizes that females choose “attractive” male(s) with the most exaggerated ornaments based solely upon the males' possession of that ornament. This female preference for ornamentation based upon being solely a male possession can undermine natural selection by selecting for an ornament that may otherwise be non-adaptive and selected against in natural selection which results in male offspring more likely to possess the ornament and female offspring more likely to possess the preference for the ornament. Over subsequent generations this can lead to the runaway selection by means of a positive feedback mechanism for males who possess the most exaggerated ornaments (made possible through the genetic variability and heritability of both the ornament and the preference).Halliburton, R. (2004) Introduction to Population Genetics. ISBN 0-13-016380-5
Fisherian runaway sought to explain the paradox of male ornamentation but neither the mechanism nor the secondary sexual characteristic or preference is restricted to this system: Fisherian runaway can be applied to include sexually dimorphic traits and characters such as behaviour and structural displays expressed by either sex.
Fisherian runaway has been difficult to demonstrate empirically, despite being theoretically plausible, due in part to the difficulty of detecting the genetic mechanism and the process by which it is initiated.

The Goodrich Corporation formerly the B.F. Goodrich Company, was an American aerospace manufacturing company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Founded in Akron, Ohio in 1870 as Goodrich, Tew & Co. by Dr. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich. The company name was changed to the "B.F. Goodrich Company" in 1880, to BFGoodrich in the 1980s, and to "Goodrich Corporation" in 2001.
In 1869 Benjamin Franklin Goodrich purchased the Hudson River Rubber Company, a small business in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. The following year Goodrich accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron, Ohio, to relocate his business there. Goodrich ranked 67th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 
The company grew to be one of the largest tire and rubber manufacturers in the world, helped in part by the 1986 merger with Uniroyal (formerly the United States Rubber Company). This product line was sold to Michelin in 1988, and the company merged with Rohr (1997), Coltec Industries, and TRW Aeronautical Systems (formerly Lucas Aerospace) in 2002. The sale of the specialty chemicals division and subsequent change to the current name completed the transformation. In 2006, company sales were $5.8 billion, of which 18%, 16% and 12% of total revenues were accounted for by the U.S. government, Airbus and Boeing, respectively.
In 1936 the company entered the Mexican market in a joint venture with Euzkadi (Now part of Continental AG) (named:Goodrich-Euzkadi). The Troy, Ohio plant was purchased in 1946 from Waco. Since then, Goodrich has manufactured wheels and brakes for a variety of aircraft. Among these are commercial, military, regional, and business programs. This successful operation lies at the core of Goodrich's business. Competitors include the aerostructures divisions of companies such as Honeywell, Messier-Bugatti, Aircraft Braking Systems, (Howmet/Huck) and SNECMA. The Hood Rubber Company was sold before the Great DepressionFilmmaker documents the impact of Hood Rubber on Watertown's Armenian history, Jen Thomas, Wicked Local Watertown, 7 January 2007 (retrieved 8 September 2010) as a division of the B.F. Goodrich Company.http://rides.webshots.com/photo/1068618180033356422svmfmu
Even though B.F. Goodrich is still a popular brand name of tires, the Goodrich Corporation exited the tire business in 1988. The tire business and use of the name was sold to Michelin. Before the sale to Michelin, Goodrich ran television and print ads showing an empty expanse of blue sky, to distinguish themselves from the similar-sounding Goodyear tire company. The tag line was, "See that blimp up in the sky? We're the other guys!" Sometimes someone would trick a friend to get him to look for the blimp, then tell the victim "Goodrich doesn't have a blimp!"  The company was also sometimes confused with Mr. Goodwrench as the two last names were very close and especially when B.F. Goodrich tires were featured on many General Motors cars and trucks at one point.

CATEGORIES: American funk musical groups, Dub musical groups, American industrial music groups, On-U Sound Records artists

Tackhead (styled TACK>>HEAD, sometimes known as Fats Comet) are an industrial hip-hop group that were most active during the 1980s and early 1990s, and briefly reformed in 2004 for a tour. Their music occupies the territory where funk, dub, industrial music and electronica intersect. The core members are Doug Wimbish (bass), Keith Leblanc (percussion) and Skip McDonald (guitar) and producer (sometimes credited as "mixologist") Adrian Sherwood. Despite being short-lived as band proper (there are only two albums credited to the band "Tackhead"), the legacy and output of these groups of musicians has been prodigious.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

[[Base bleed]]
CATEGORIES: Artillery ammunition, Ammunition

Base bleed is a system used on some artillery shells to increase their range, typically by about 30%.
Most of the drag on an artillery shell comes from the nose of the shell, as it pushes the air out of its way at supersonic speeds. Shaping the shell properly can reduce this greatly. However, another powerful source of drag is the vacuum left behind the shell due to its blunt base. This drag is difficult to remove, because the shell needs to be "nose heavy" in order to have proper ballistics, and it cannot easily be shaped into a more aerodynamic form.
Base bleed is one way to reduce this drag without extending the base of the shell. Instead, a small ring of metal extends just past the base, and the area in the rear of the shell is filled with a small gas generator. The gas generator provides little net thrust, but simply fills the area behind the shell with pressure, dramatically reducing the drag due to the vacuum. The only downsides are a small loss of accuracy due to the somewhat more turbulent airflow, and a small loss in explosive payload due to some of the shell being taken up by the engine.
Since base bleed extends the range by a percentage, it is only really useful on longer range artillery. Until recently the loss in explosive was not considered worthwhile for the small gains in range. However, the introduction of much longer range systems based on the GC-45 howitzer has changed the equation somewhat, as 30% extra range on these systems represents 5 to 10 km. Base bleed shells are starting to become more common in units equipped with modern artillery of this type.

Eels (often typeset as eels or EELS) is an American alternative rock band, formed in California in 1995 by singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Mark Oliver Everett, better known as "E" (son of famous physicist Hugh Everett III). Band members have changed across the years, both in the studio and on stage, making Everett the only official member for the most of the band's work. Often filled with themes about family, death and lost love, Eels' music straddles a wide range of genres, which is evidenced with the peculiar musical style of every album. Since 1996, Eels has made eleven major studio releases, The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett (2014) being their most recent release.
Eels appear on several film soundtracks, including Scream 2, American Beauty, Road Trip, Holes, The Anniversary Party, Knocked Up, Yes Man, The End of Violence, Hellboy II, Hot Fuzz, Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away 3D, Charlie Bartlett, Enough Said, Delivery Man, and the first three Shrek films.

Switched-On Bach is a musical album by Wendy Carlos (originally released under the name of Walter Carlos) and Benjamin Folkman, produced by Carlos and Rachel Elkind and released in March 1968 by Columbia Masterworks Records. It played a key role in popularizing classical music performed on electronic synthesizers, which had until then been relegated to experimental and "pop" music. This fostered a significant increase in interest in electronically rendered music in general, and the Moog synthesizer in particular.
Switched-On Bach was one of the first classical albums to sell 500,000 copies. Entering the top 40 of the Billboard 200 pop chart on March 1, 1969, it climbed quickly to the Top 10; it stayed in the Top 40 for 17 weeks,Joel Whitburn. Top 40 Albums. New York: Billboard Books. and in the Top 200 for more than a year. In the 1969 Grammy Awards, the album took three prizes: Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with or without orchestra) and Best Engineered Classical Recording.

[[Compactor]]

CATEGORIES: Tools, Engineering vehicles, Waste collection, Home appliances

A compactor is a machine or mechanism used to reduce the size of waste material or soil through compaction. A trash compactor is often used by a home or business to reduce the volume of trash.
Normally powered by hydraulics, compactors take many shapes and sizes. In landfill sites for example, a large bulldozer with spiked wheels called a landfill compactor is used to drive over waste deposited by waste collection vehicles (WCVs).
WCVs themselves incorporate a compacting mechanism which is used to increase the payload of the vehicle and reduce the number of times it has to empty. This usually takes the form of hydraulically powered sliding plates which sweep out the collection hopper and compress the material into what has already been loaded.
Different compactors are used in scrap metal processing, the most familiar being the car crusher. Such devices can be of either the "pancake" type, where a scrap automobile is flattened by a huge descending hydraulically powered plate, or the baling press, where the automobile is compressed from several directions until it resembles a large cube.

It was a cultural consequence of a long chain of interactions begun by Greek forays into India from the time of Alexander the Great, carried further by the establishment of Indo-Greek rule in the area for some centuries, and extended during flourishing of the Hellenized empire of the Kushans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]  Greco-Buddhism influenced the artistic, and perhaps the spiritual development of Buddhism, particularly Mahayana Buddhism, which represents one of the two main branches of Buddhism."Greek as well as Iranian influences appear to have shaped the evolution of Mahayana images (and perhaps thought as well)".

[[Shelvoke and Drewry]]
CATEGORIES: Waste collection vehicles, Companies established in 1922, Companies disestablished in 1992, Companies based in Hertfordshire, Dennis Group, Defunct truck manufacturers of the United Kingdom

Shelvoke & Drewry was a British manufacturer of specialised commercial vehicles, now defunct.  It was best known for its innovative waste collection vehicles, which were once the preferred choice of municipal authorities in the UK. It also manufactured fire engines, buses and fork-lift trucks.
Based in Letchworth, Hertfordshire in England, it was started in 1922 by Harry Shelvoke and James Drewry, both of whom had successful careers in commercial vehicle design and manufacture.
Its first product was the "Freighter", originally a multi-purpose flatbed truck notable for its tiny wheels and tiller-type steering, but it was soon adapted for refuse collection.  SD soon became an established innovator in the field of refuse collection vehicle design, producing vehicles such as the Fore and Aft Tipper, which used a pivoting body to redistribute the load, and the Revopak of the 1970s which used a huge revolving fork to mutilate and compact refuse.  
During the Second World War, like most British manufacturing companies, S&D's entire output was devoted to the war effort, producing aircraft parts, equipment for landing craft and tanks, and even a miniature submarine (the Welfreighter) at their Letchworth plant.
In the late 1970s, SD went head-to-head with its arch-rival Dennis, and began manufacturing fire engines through its newly established Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) division.  
In the 1980s, SD became part of the Dempster Brothers company of the United States, and continued to trade, under the name "Shelvoke Dempster", through the 1980s, although its product range diversified further into front-end loading dustcarts (based on Dempster's ubiquitous "Dumpster" system), as well as a licence-built version of Dempster's "Routechief" rear loading refuse body.  The company was however plunging deeper into a financial crisis, and by the end of the 1980s, Dempster had pulled out. The remainder of the company was then absorbed into Dennis, and the "Dennis-Shelvoke" name continued briefly, but the company was effectively dead by 1992.
SD's demise was attributed to a number of factors - for instance the deregulation of waste collection in the 1980s meant that many municipal authorities subcontracted this activity out to private companies.  SD's vehicles had traditionally been considerably more expensive than those of their competitors (largely due to their hand-built aluminium bodywork) and cost-conscious councils soon started investing in cheaper foreign vehicles. SD had also spent huge amounts trying to make money on the SPV venture, and fought an increasingly futile battle with Dennis.  SD tenaciously stuck with their Revopak continuous loading system for waste collection vehicles, which, although effective, was more expensive to operate due to higher fuel consumption, and authorities looked for cost-saving intermittent-loading dustcarts instead.  Dennis launched their "Phoenix" range of sweep/slide style refuse compactor dustcarts in 1979, which, with their lower operating costs, quickly eroded SD's market share.
Despite the closing of the company, many hundreds of SD vehicles are still in service. For example, many fire engines are used at small provincial airports, and many developing countries use ex-British second-hand refuse collection vehicles, most notably on the island of Malta.

A Playmate is a female model featured in the centerfold/gatefold of Playboy magazine as Playmate of the Month (PMOM). The PMOM's pictorial includes nude photographs and a centerfold poster, along with a pictorial biography and the "Playmate Data Sheet", which lists her birthdate, measurements, turn-ons, and turn-offs. At the end of the year, one of the twelve Playmates of the Month is named Playmate of the Year (PMOY). Currently, Playmates of the Month are paid US$25,000 and Playmates of the Year receive an additional US$100,000 plus a car and a motorcycle. In addition, Anniversary Playmates are usually chosen to celebrate a milestone year of the magazine.
Playboy encourages potential Playmates to send photos with "girl next door" appeal for consideration; others may submit photos of Playmate candidates, and may be eligible for a finder's fee if their model is selected. In addition, "casting calls" are held regularly in major US cities to offer opportunities for women to test for Playboy. The Playboy photographers and Hugh Hefner then select which models become Playmates. The Playmate of the Year is chosen personally by Hugh Hefner, taking into account an annual readers' poll.
According to Playboy, there is no such thing as a former Playmate because “Once a Playmate, always a Playmate”.Playboy.com: Playmate Milestones

[[Revopak]]
CATEGORIES: Waste collection vehicles

The Revopak is a type of waste collection vehicle manufactured by the British company Shelvoke and Drewry.
Introduced in 1971, the Revopak was in fact a British-built clone of a French Bennes-Ray Superpac. It was among one of the first vehicles to address the problem of compacting and destroying the high content of packaging materials now found in domestic refuse.  
By using a huge, hydraulic-powered rotating rake with large steel tines, refuse was scooped up from the loading hopper and forced through a set of stationary tines.  The continuous rotation of the rake progressively mangled, mutilated and compacted the refuse so as to reduce the space required to dump it at the landfill site.  
Two generations of the Revopak were produced - the early 1971-1973 models used hydraulic motors which drove the compaction rake by means of chains, while the later models utilised a simpler and more robust drive system which consisted of twin synchronised hydraulic rams to operate the compaction system.  Many variations were made of the basic design, including a multitude of different body lengths and payloads, plus SD developed bin lifters as an optional extra - a precursor to the modern wheeled bin collection systems of today.  One disadvantage of the system was heavier fuel consumption, since the compaction system has to run continuously in order to be effective.
The Revopak was in continuous production until 1990, when SD went out of business, although the French built unit is still manufactured by SEMAT.

Quark is a type of fresh dairy product. It is made by warming soured milk until the desired degree of coagulation (denaturation) of milk proteins is met, and then strained.also see this diagram for another manufacturing process Dictionaries usually translate it as curd cheese or cottage cheese, although most commercial varieties of cottage cheese are made with rennet, whereas traditional quark is not. It is soft, white and unaged, similar to some types of fromage blanc. It is distinct from ricotta because ricotta (Italian: "recooked") is made from scalded whey. It is similar to the Indian Chakka. Quark usually has no salt added.
In Germany, quark is sold in small plastic tubs and usually comes in three different varieties, Magerquark (lean quark, virtually fat-free), "regular" quark (20% fat in dry mass) and Sahnequark (creamy quark, 40% fat in dry mass) with added cream. While Magerquark is often used for baking and as health food, e.g. as a breakfast spread, Sahnequark also forms the basis of a large number of quark desserts. Much like yoghurts in some parts of the world, these foods mostly come with fruit flavouring (Früchtequark, fruit quark), and are often also simply referred to as quark. Because mainstream popularity of quark desserts is limited to mainly the German-speaking and eastern European countries, confusion might arise when talking about quark with people unfamiliar with cuisine from this area.

Legislative elections for the Spanish Cortes Generales were held on 6 June 1993. The elections were for 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies, and the 208 directly elected seats in the upper house, the Senate,  determining the Prime Minister of Spain.
The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party under Felipe González achieved the largest number of votes and seats for the fourth consecutive time, though it lost its absolute majority in both chambers of the Cortes. In contrast, José María Aznar's People's Party won a large share of the vote, thus increasing their seats in both the Congress and the Senate and consolidating its position as the main opposition party. For the first time since 1979, the election brought in a hung parliament, forcing the governing PSOE to pact with nationalist groups in order to renew their mandate.
In the aftermath of the election, the PSOE saw itself under increased pressure due both to political instability as a result of its low majority (relying on increasingly-unstable pacts with Convergence and Union to pass its legislation) and of the uncovering of numerous cases of corruption within the government itself. The pact with CiU would end in the fall of 1995, forcing PM Felipe González to call early elections 15 months before their scheduled date, which would see the opposition right-wing People's Party of Aznar win for the first time.

It was one of the nominees to be voted into The Beano by readers in early 2004. Although Joe Jitsu won, it was only a 1% victory over Colin, so both were added to The Beano. Colin also appeared in the Beano Annuals for 2006 and 2007.
A running gag in his comic strips included hidden "Celebrity Pets", which are fictional pets owned by famous people. Many of the pets' descriptions are puns on the name of the celebrity. (Such as "Ant and Dec's Ant on decks")

The Wisconsin Woodchucks are an American baseball team that plays in the Northwoods League, a collegiate summer baseball league. They play their home games at Athletic Park in Wausau, Wisconsin. The team was known as the Wausau Woodchucks 1994–98.
The team fills the void left by the Wausau Timbers of the Class A Midwest League, who relocated after the 1990 season to Geneva, Illinois, to become the Kane County Cougars.
The 'Chucks gained some star power for the 2007 season, as former Milwaukee Brewer and University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh product Jim Gantner manages the team. Gantner has been involved with the Brewers in various capacities since his retirement in 1992, including some coaching, but the Woodchucks job is his first managerial experience.
Gantner, a native Wisconsinite who owns a second home in Boulder Junction, is familiar with the Wausau area and had expressed interest in coaching college-age players.
A number of major leaguers and other notables have worn a Woodchucks uniform:

Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula ZnO. ZnO is a white powder that is insoluble in water, and it is widely used as an additive in numerous materials and products including rubbers, plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, lubricants, paints, ointments, adhesives, sealants, pigments, foods (source of Zn nutrient), batteries, ferrites, fire retardants, and first-aid tapes.  It occurs naturally as the mineral zincite, but most zinc oxide is produced synthetically.Marcel De Liedekerke,  "2.3. Zinc Oxide (Zinc White): Pigments, Inorganic, 1" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a20_243.pub2[/tpl]
In materials science, ZnO is a wide-bandgap semiconductor of the II-VI semiconductor group (since oxygen was classed as an element of VIA group (the 6th main group, now referred to as 16th) of the periodic table and zinc, a transition metal, as a member of the IIB (2nd B), now 12th, group).

Dimetrodon ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Dimetrodon.ogg|d|aɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|r|ə|d|ɒ|n[/tpl]; meaning "two measures of teeth") is an extinct genus of synapsid that lived during the Early Permian, around 295–272 million years ago (Ma).[tpl]cite web |url=http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?a=checkTaxonInfo&taxon_no=38904 |title=Dimetrodon |work=Paleobiology Database |accessdate=23 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1007/s12052-009-0117-4[/tpl]Huttenlocker, A. K., and E. Rega. 2012. The Paleobiology and Bone Microstructure of Pelycosauriangrade Synapsids. Pp. 90–119 in A. Chinsamy (ed.) Forerunners of Mammals: Radiation, Histology, Biology. Indiana University Press. It is a member of the family Sphenacodontidae. The most prominent feature of Dimetrodon is the large sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending from the vertebrae. It walked on four legs and had a tall, curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws. Most fossils have been found in the southwestern United States, the majority coming from a geological deposit called the Red Beds in Texas and Oklahoma. More recently, fossils have been found in Germany. Over a dozen species have been named since the genus was first described in 1878. 
Dimetrodon is often mistaken as a dinosaur or as a contemporary of dinosaurs in popular culture, but it went extinct around 40 million years before the appearance of the first dinosaur in the Triassic period. Generally reptile-like in appearance and physiology, Dimetrodon is nevertheless more closely related to mammals than it is to any living reptilian group, though it is not a direct ancestor of any mammals. Dimetrodon belongs to a group traditionally called "mammal-like reptiles", more recently termed "stem-mammals" or "non-mammalian synapsids" because many vertebrate paleontologists today group Dimetrodon together with mammals in an evolutionary group or clade called Synapsida while dinosaurs go together with living reptiles and birds in a separate group, Sauropsida. A single large opening on either side of the back of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the earliest sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the inside of the nasal cavity and a ridge at the back of the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals. 
Dimetrodon was probably one of the top predators in Early Permian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles as well as amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was more likely used in sexual display.

The pelycosaurs (from Greek πέλυξ pelyx "bowl" or "axe" and σαῦρος sauros "lizard") are an informal grouping (previously considered an order) composed of basal or primitive Late Paleozoic synapsid amniotes. Some species were quite large and could grow up to [tpl]convert|3|m|0[/tpl] or more, although most species were much smaller. Because more advanced groups of synapsids evolved directly from 'pelycosaurs', the term had fallen out of favor among scientists by the 21st century, and is only used informally, if at all, in the modern scientific literature.Botha-Brink, J. and Modesto, S.P.

CATEGORIES: Memory management

Memory protection is a way to control memory access rights on a computer, and is a part of most modern operating systems.  The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it.  This prevents a bug within a process from affecting other processes, or the operating system itself, and instead results in a segmentation fault or storage violation exception being sent to the offending process, generally causing abnormal termination (killing the process). Memory protection for computer security includes additional techniques such as address space layout randomization and  executable space protection.

[[Wild Weasel]]

Wild Weasel is a code name given by the United States Armed Forces specifically the US Air Force to an aircraft, of any type, equipped with radar-seeking missiles and tasked with destroying the radars and SAM installations of enemy air defense systems.[tpl]cite book |title=Rockets and missiles: the life story of a technology |last=Van Riper |first=A. Bowdoin |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=0-313-32795-5 |page=188 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=NmPcWqPJySgC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=wild+weasel+special+aircraft+equipped+with+radar+seeking+missiles#v=onepage&q=&f=false |accessdate=5 October 2009[/tpl]Hewitt, W.A. "Planting the seeds of SEAD: The Wild Weasel in Vietnam." School of Advanced Airpower Studies, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, PhD Thesis. May 1992. Accessed 5 October 2009.
The Wild Weasel concept was developed by the United States Air Force in 1965, after the introduction of Soviet SAM missiles and their downing of U.S. strike aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam.Davies p. 4, 5 The program was headed by General Kenneth Dempster.
Wild Weasel tactics and techniques began their developmment in 1965 following the commencement of Operation Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War, and were later adapted by other nations during following conflicts, as well as being integrated into the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) a plan used by US air forces to establish immediate air control, prior to possible full scale conflict. Initially known by the operational code "Iron Hand" when first authorized on 12 August 1965, the term "Wild Weasel" derives from Project Wild Weasel, the USAF development program for a dedicated SAM-detection and suppression aircraft. (The technique {or a specific part} was also called an "Iron Hand" mission, though technically the Iron Hand part refers only to a suppression attack that paves the way for the main strike.Iron Hand (National Museum of the United States Air Force website. Accessed 26 January 2009.)) Originally named "Project Ferret", denoting a predatory animal that goes into its prey's den to kill it (hence: "to ferret out"), the name was changed to differentiate it from the code-name "Ferret" that had been used during World War II for radar counter-measures bombers.
In brief, the task of a Wild Weasel aircraft is to bait enemy anti-aircraft defenses into targeting it with their radars, whereupon the radar waves are traced back to their source allowing the Weasel or its teammates to precisely target it for destruction. A simple analogy is playing the game of "flashlight tag" in the dark; a flashlight is usually the only reliable means of identifying someone in order to "tag" (destroy) them, but the light immediately renders the bearer able to be identified and attacked as well. The result is a hectic game of cat-and-mouse in which the radar "flashlights" are rapidly cycled on and off in an attempt to identify and kill the target before the target is able to home in on the emitted radar "light" and destroy the site.

The tell includes two phases of ritual use dating back to the 10th-8th millennium BC. During the first phase (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)), circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars were erected. More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through geophysical surveys. Each pillar has a height of up to [tpl]convert|6|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and a weight of up to 20 tons.

In the second phase (Pre-pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)), the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished lime.
The site was abandoned after the PPNB-period. Younger structures date to classical times.
The function of the structures is not yet clear. The most common opinion, shared by excavator Klaus Schmidt, is that they are early neolithic sanctuaries.

[[Optically stimulated luminescence]]

CATEGORIES: Particle detectors, Dating methods

In physics, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is a method for measuring doses from ionizing radiation.
The method makes use of electrons trapped between the valence and conduction bands in the crystalline structure of certain types of matter (such as quartz, feldspar, and aluminium oxide). The trapping sites are imperfections of the lattice - impurities or defects. The ionizing radiation produces electron-hole pairs - electrons are in the conduction band and holes in the valence band. The electrons which have been excited to the conduction band may become entrapped in the electron or hole traps.  Under stimulation of light the electrons may free themselves from the trap and get into the conduction band. From the conduction band they may recombine with holes trapped in hole traps. If the centre with the hole is a luminescence center (radiative recombination centre) emission of light will occur.  The photons are detected using a photomultiplier tube.  The signal from the tube is then used to calculate the dose that the material had absorbed.
The OSL dosimeter provides a new degree of sensitivity by giving an accurate reading as low as 1 mrem for x-ray and gamma ray photons with energies ranging from 5 keV to greater than 40 MeV.  The OSL dosimeter's maximum equivalent dose measurement for x-ray and gamma ray photons is 1000 rem.  For beta particles with energies from 150 keV to in excess of 10 MeV, dose measurement ranges from 10 mrem to 1000 rem.  Neutron radiation with energies of 40 keV to greater than 35 MeV has a dose measurement range from 20 mrem to 25 rem.  In diagnostic imaging the increased sensitivity of the OSL dosimeter makes it ideal for monitoring employees working in low-radiation environments and for pregnant workers.
OSL is used in at least two different applications:
In order to carry out OSL dating, mineral grains have to be extracted from the sample.  Most commonly these are so-called coarse grains - 100-200 μm, or fine grains - 4-11 μm. Occasionally other grain sizes are used.
The difference between radiocarbon dating and OSL is that the former is used to date organic materials, while the latter is used to date minerals. Events that can be dated using OSL are, for example, the mineral's last exposure to sunlight; Mungo Man, Australia's oldest human find, was dated in this manner. It is also used for dating the deposition of geological sediments after they have been transported by air (eolian sediments) or rivers (fluvial sediments). In archaeology, OSL dating is applied to the dating of ceramics: the dated event is the time of their last heating to a high temperature (in excess of 400 °C).
Recent OSL dating of stone tools in Arabia pushed the "out-of-Africa" date hypothesis of human migration back 50,000 years and added a possible path of migration from the African continent to the Arabian peninsula instead of through Europe.[ref]

The most popular OSL method is called single-aliquot regeneration, or SAR.

[[Offshore company]]

CATEGORIES: Offshoring, International taxation, Offshore finance, Legal entities, Types of business entity

An offshore company is a legal entity established in a tax haven or offshore financial center, being protected by specific legislation which guarantees a status of partial or full tax exemption. Yearly maintenance fees range from US $100 to US $1500 or more, depending of the type of the company and its jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, annual company fixed tax is paid to the government such as it is the case with the Republic of Panama. Shareholders and directors of an offshore company may enjoy generally a high level of privacy. In some jurisdictions, offshore companies may trade or do business only outside of the country in order to be tax exempt, while in others companies may do local and international business.
The most known type of an offshore company is the IBC or International Business Company, which are often found in offshore jurisdictions. Such a company is usually required to do business with non-residents of the jurisdiction where they are formed, in order to remain tax exempt.
The legal restrictions that offshore companies are in some jurisdictions subjected to, generally prevent them from having a fixed establishment in the country where they were incorporated. For this reason, they are mostly used for activities which are not tied to a specific geographic location. This may include brokerage in commodities and goods, intangible e-commerce activities or intellectual property administration. They are also often used as holding companies or as asset protection or investment vehicles for their owners, because of their simplicity of administration, as in vast majority of jurisdictions it is not required to file annual reports or accounts.
There are certain countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore, or Uruguay, that apply the so-called territorial tax system. This means that individuals and businesses, both residents and non residents, will be taxed merely on the income sources generated within their territory, while any profits made overseas will be tax exempt. Thus, a company which only conducts business abroad, may generally also be able to operate tax free but, unlike it happens in offshore jurisdictions, they will not operate under any special legislation for non-residents. The fiscal conditions will be exactly the same, regardless of whether the shareholders are residents or non-residents and there is no restriction to conduct business with local individuals or corporations, something that is prohibited in the case of a traditional offshore companies.
Most of legitimate uses of offshore companies are: international trading, asset protection, holding company, captive insurance, yacht registration, and legal tax avoidance, protection of intellectual property, succession planning or confidentiality.

The Tyndale Monument  is a tower built on a hill at North Nibley, Gloucestershire, England. It was built in honour of William Tyndale, a translator of the New Testament, who is believed to have been born at North Nibley.
The tower was constructed in 1866 and is 111 ft (34 m) tall. It is possible to enter and climb to the top of the tower, up a spiral staircase of about 120 steps. The hill it is on allows a wide range of views, especially looking down to the River Severn A nearby topograph points to some other landmarks visible. The hill on which the monument stands is quite steep. There are two main paths, one which goes up steep steps, or one that follows a rough slope. The tower itself is surrounded by fencing and has floodlights that light up the tower at night. The Cotswold Way long-distance footpath passes the foot of the monument, and then descends the hill into North Nibley.
The door to the tower is normally unlocked on weekends, otherwise you can get the key from the village shop.[tpl]cite web|title=Tyndale Monument - Places of Interest|url=http://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=2024|publisher=Gloucestershire County Council|accessdate=29 April 2011[/tpl]  A deposit is required for borrowing the key and the there is a nominal admission charge.[tpl]cite web|title=Wotton-under-Edge and Tyndale monument|url=http://www.walkscene.co.uk/description_45/WottonunderEdge_and_Tyndale_monument.html|publisher=Walk Scene|accessdate=29 April 2011[/tpl]  Locally, it is commonly called Nibley Monument rather than its official name.
There is a plaque on the front of the tower. The text engraved on it reads:
 
 
The monument is a landmark that can be seen for miles, even in places as far as Bristol over 20 miles away. In the town of Thornbury there is a street called Tyndale View where the tower can be seen from approximately 10 miles away.
Further down the Cotswold Edge, at Hawkesbury, is the Somerset Monument, erected in 1846, and the design of the Tyndale tower has features in common with this.

[[Insertion device]]
CATEGORIES: Synchrotron instrumentation

An insertion device (ID) is a component in modern synchrotron light sources, so called because they are "inserted" into accelerator track. They are periodic magnetic structures that stimulate highly brilliant, forward-directed synchrotron radiation emission by forcing a stored charged particle beam to perform wiggles, or undulations, as they pass through the device. This motion is caused by the Lorentz force, and it is from this oscillatory motion that we get the names for the two classes of device, which are known as wigglers and undulators.
As well as creating a brighter light, some insertion devices enable tuning of the light so that different frequencies can be generated for different applications.

[[Processed cheese]]

CATEGORIES: American cheeses, Processed cheese

Processed cheese (a.k.a., process cheese; cheese slice; prepared cheese; cheese product; cheese singles; or, cheese food) is a food product made from a normal cheese (and sometimes other, unfermented, dairy by-product ingredients); plus emulsifiers, saturated vegetable oils, extra salt, food colorings, and/or whey or sugar. As a result, many flavors, colors, and textures of processed cheese exist.
In the United States, the most recognizable variety of processed cheese is sold under the name American cheese. American cheese is pre-processed at mechanized factories and usually bought pre-sliced and pre-packaged at a supermarket. The name American cheese has a legal definition as a specific type of pasteurized, processed cheese, under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Article 133, Section 169 (Pasteurized process cheese), the allowed usage of the term "American Cheese" for certain types of "Pasteurized process cheese" is detailed.  Specifically, in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of section 133.169, it states In case it is made of cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, or granular cheese or any mixture of two or more of these, it may be designated "Pasteurized process American cheese"; or when cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, granular cheese, or any mixture of two or more of these is combined with other varieties of cheese in the cheese ingredient, any of such cheeses or such mixture may be designated as "American cheese.[ref]"
</ref>
Although the invention of processed cheese is credited to Walter Gerber of Thun, Switzerland in 1911, it was James L. Kraft who first applied for a U.S. patent for his method of making processed cheese, in 1916.[ref]
</ref><ref name="KraftHistory">
</ref> [[Kraft Foods]] developed the first commercially-available, shelf-stable, sliced, processed cheese; it was introduced in 1950. This form of sliced cheese (and its derivatives) have become ubiquitous in U.S. households ever since, most notably used for [[cheeseburgers]] and [[grilled cheese sandwiches]] (due to its ability to cook evenly, distribute/stretch smoothly, and resist [[Congelation|congealing]] — unlike natural, [[cheddar cheese]]s).

The current resolution determined that "the magnitude of human tragedy caused by the conflict in Somalia, further exacerbated by the obstacles being created to the distribution of humanitarian assistance" constituted a threat to international peace and security.[tpl]cite book|last=Sarooshi|first=Danesh|title=The United Nations and the development of collective security: the delegation by the UN Security Council of its chapter VII powers|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2000|page=212|isbn=978-0-19-829934-9[/tpl]
The Council once again, strongly condemned violations of international humanitarian law and demanded the cessation of all hostilities from all parties involved, urging them to co-operate with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and military, including allowing access by military personnel and humanitarian organisations to the affected population and to ensure their safety. It also authorised a further deployment of 3,500 personnel of the United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNISOM II) created in Resolution 775 to Somalia and informing it should proceed at the discretion of the Secretary-General.
The resolution went on to endorse a recommendation by the Secretary-General that action should be taken under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and welcomed offers by Member States concerning the creation of an operation to create a secure environment for humanitarian operations, that later became known as UNITAF. At the time of his report, disarmament and the problem of security was not resolved.[tpl]cite book|last=Fenton|first=Neil|title=Understanding the UN Security Council: coercion or consent?|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|date=2004|page=85|isbn=978-0-7546-4092-9[/tpl] The Council authorised such action to be taken by Member States, and appointed an ad hoc commission composed of members of the Security Council to report on the implementation of the current resolution. 
Acting under Chapter VII and Chapter VIII, the Council urged states and agencies to ensure strict implementation of the arms embargo against Somalia imposed in Resolution 733. Resolution 794 ended by requiring states participating in UNITAF and the Secretary-General to report regularly on the progress they are making in Somalia so that arrangements can be handed back over to UNISOM II.

Adam-ondi-Ahman ([tpl]IPAc-en|æ|d|əm|_|ɑ:|n|d|aɪ|_|ɑ:|m|ən[/tpl], sometimes clipped to Diahman) is a historic site in Daviess County, Missouri about five miles south of Jameson. It is located along the east bluffs above the Grand River. According to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), it is the site where Adam and Eve lived after being expelled from the Garden of Eden. They believe it will be a gathering spot for a meeting of the priesthood leadership, including prophets of all ages and other righteous people, prior to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.
The Latter Day Saints proposed to build a temple there. Such efforts were halted in the 19th century as a result of the 1838 Mormon War to evict the Latter Day Saints from Missouri. Their having declared Adam-ondi-Ahman as a sacred site for a temple was a flash point in that confrontation.
After the Latter Day Saints were evicted, residents renamed the site Cravensville. It was the site of a skirmish during the American Civil War on August 4, 1862, when Union troops attempted to stop Confederate reinforcements in the First Battle of Independence. Six Confederates were killed and 10 wounded. The Union forces had five wounded.[tpl]cite web |work=Daviess County Historical Society |first=David |last=Stark |url=http://www.daviesscountyhistoricalsociety.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=65&mode=mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 |title=Deadly Skirmish in Daviess County |date=2004-03-06[/tpl]

Semiosis (from the [tpl]lang-el|σημείωσις[/tpl], sēmeíōsis, a derivation of the verb [tpl]lang|grc|σημειῶ[/tpl], sēmeiô, "to mark") is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, including the production of meaning. Briefly – semiosis is sign process. The term was introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) to describe a process that interprets signs as referring to their objects, as described in his theory of sign relations, or semiotics. Semiosis is triadic and cyclic. Other theories of sign processes are sometimes carried out under the heading of semiology, following on the work of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913).

The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terriers of the 18th century. The breed is named after the person credited with the creation of this type of dog, the Reverend John "Jack" Russell. It is the recognised conformation show variety of the Jack Russell Terrier and was first recognised in 1990 in the United Kingdom as the Parson Jack Russell Terrier. In America, it was first recognised as the Jack Russell Terrier in 1997. The name was changed to its current form in 1999 in the UK and by 2008 all international kennel clubs recognised it under the new name.
A mostly white breed with either a smooth, rough or broken coat, it conforms to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell. It is a feisty, energetic terrier, suited to sports and able to get along with children and other animals. It has a range of breed related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.

[[Russell Terrier]]

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Terriers, Dog breeds originating in England, Rare dog breeds

The Russell Terrier is a predominantly white working terrier with an insatiable instinct to hunt formidable quarry underground. The breed was derived from the Reverend John Russell's fox working terrier strains that were used in the 19th century for fox hunting. The Reverend's fox working strains were much smaller than the Show Fox Terrier and remained working terriers. The size of the Russell Terrier (10″ to 12″) combined with a small flexible, spannable chest makes it an ideal size to work efficiently underground. Their unique rectangular body shape with the body being of slightly longer length than the leg makes them distinctly different from the Parson Russell Terrier and the JRTCA Jack Russell Terrier.
The Russell Terrier originated in England with Australia being designated as the country of development.

[[Dragonnades]]
CATEGORIES: Religion in the Ancien Régime, Anti-Protestantism, Huguenot history, French words and phrases, 1681 establishments, 1681 in France

The "Dragonnades" were the result of a French policy instituted by Louis XIV in 1681 to intimidate Huguenot families into either leaving France or re-converting to Catholicism. This involved billeting ill-disciplined dragoons in Protestant households.  With the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Louis XIV withdrew the privileges and toleration that Protestant Huguenots in France had been guaranteed under the edict for nearly 87 years, and ordered the destruction of Huguenot churches and the closure of Huguenot schools.
With the edict revoking religious toleration, Louis XIV combined legal persecution with the policy of terrorizing recalcitrant Huguenots who refused to convert to Catholicism by billeting both dragoons and ordinary infantrymen in their homes and instructing the soldiers to harass and intimidate the occupants to persuade them to either convert to the state religion or to emigrate. As mounted infantry, the 14 regiments of dragoons in the French Army of the period were sometimes used for what would now be called internal security duties and were an effective instrument for persecuting the Huguenots.Rene Chartrand, "Louis XIV's Army", ISBN 0-85045-850-1 
The application of selective and coercive troop quartering had been initiated by the intendant René de Marillac in Poitou, in 1681. With the permission of Louvois, Marillac systematically lodged troops with Protestants, in the expectation that the existing law exempting newly converted from this practice would spur conversions. Billetted troops got so far out of hand that, after a series of reprimands in letters, Louvois was forced to recall Marillac from Poitou.This episode is recounted in L. L. Bernard, "Foucault, Louvois, and the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes", Church History 25.1 (March 1956):27-40) p. 32ff, and remarked in Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. "Louis XIV: Louis XIV and Protestants"; Musée virtuel du protestantisme français" les draghonnades.
The persecution of Protestants caused outrage in England and created a wave of literature in protest against the inhuman treatment of Huguenots, thousands of whom fled to England to seek asylum. The dragonnades policy caused Protestants to flee France even before the religious rights granted them by the Edict of Nantes were removed in 1685. Most Huguenot refugees fled to countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, England, and the German territories.
On January 17, 1686, Louis XIV claimed that his policies had caused the Protestant population of France to be reduced from 800,000-900,000 to 1,000–1,500 in France. Though this was a great exaggeration, their numbers did decline significantly.  The campaign ultimately proved detrimental to France's economy because the Huguenots who chose to flee possessed skills such as silkweaving, clock-making, silversmithing, and optometry, and became a valuable addition to the economies of the countries to which they fled, including Louis's sworn enemies in the United Netherlands and the nascent Great Britain.

The mountain range is a branch of the Albertine Rift Mountains, which border the western branch of the East African Rift. They are located between Lake Edward and Lake Kivu.  The name "Virunga" is an English version of the Kinyarwanda word ibirunga, which means "volcanoes".
The mountain range consists of eight major volcanoes. Most of them are dormant, except Mount Nyiragongo [tpl]convert|3462|m|ft[/tpl] and Mount Nyamuragira [tpl]convert|3063|m|ft[/tpl], both in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Davaar Island or Island Davaar ([tpl]lang-gd|Eilean Dà Bhàrr[/tpl]) is located at the mouth of Campbeltown Loch off the east coast of Kintyre, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It is a tidal island, linked to the mainland by a natural shingle causeway called the Dhorlin near Campbeltown at low tide. The crossing can be made in around 40 minutes.
Davaar was known as the island of Sanct Barre between the years 1449 to 1508. The modern form Davaar is from older Do Bharre - thy St Barre. Dr Gillies in his "Place Names of Argyll" appears to accept the popular derivation, Double-pointed (Da-Bharr) Island.
In 1854, a Lighthouse was built on the north of the island by the lighthouse engineers David and Thomas Stevenson. The lighthouse was automated in 1983, and today, Davaar is inhabited by caretakers, sheep, goats and mink.
The Lookout, a square building standing on a small knoll close to the lighthouse, was built during World War Two to house naval crews, whose task it was to stretch anti-submarine nets across the water, protecting Campbeltown. It is now rented out as a holiday home.Peter Caton (2011) No Boat Required - Exploring Tidal Islands. Matador.
The island is also known for its seven caves, one of which contains a life size cave painting depicting the crucifixion, painted in 1887 by local artist Archibald MacKinnon after he had a vision in a dream suggesting him to do so. The painting caused uproar in the area as it was seen as a sign from God; it is said that when the townsfolk discovered it was MacKinnon, and not God, he was exiled from the town indefinitely. Restored several times since, including twice by the original artist, the painting was vandalised in July 2006, having a red and black depiction of Che Guevara painted over the original masterpiece. It has since been restored again.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5235666.stm| title=Che vandal attacks Christ image| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=11 December 2007 | date=2006-08-01[/tpl]
Davaar Island is one of 43 tidal islands that can be walked to from the mainland of Great Britain and one of 17 that can be walked to from the Scottish mainland.
In 2001 the island had a population of 2 as recorded by the census[tpl]GRO10[/tpl] but in 2011 there were no "usual residents" living there.[tpl]NRS1C[/tpl]

Louis Segond (October 3, 1810 – June 18, 1885), was a Swiss theologian who translated the Bible into French from the original texts in Hebrew and Greek.
He was born in Plainpalais, near Geneva. After studying theology in Geneva, Strasbourg and Bonn, he was pastor of the Geneva National Church in Chêne-Bougeries, then from 1872, Professor of Old Testament in Geneva.
The translation of the Old Testament, commissioned by the Vénérable Compagnie des Pasteurs de Genève, was published in two volumes in 1871 (Meusel has 1874 as the publication date), followed by the New Testament, translated as a private venture, in 1880.
The text was then reviewed by experts. The result is the 1910 revision
that is now freely available on Internet.

CATEGORIES: 1920 births, 2000 deaths, American botanists, Pteridologists, Botanists with author abbreviations, University of Michigan faculty

Warren H. Wagner Jr. (August 29, 1920 – January 8, 2000), known as Herb Wagner, from his middle name, "Herbert,"  was an 
eminent American botanist who was trained at Berkeley with E.B. Copeland and lived most of his professional career in Michigan.  A longtime faculty member at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), he developed, in the early 1960s, the first algorithm for discerning phylogenetic relationships among species based upon their respective character states observed over a set of characters.  This work was honored by James Farris and Arnold Kluge in their later appellation of related algorithms as "Wagner parsimony."
Wagner specialized in the ferns, later in life especially the Botrychiaceae.  Having served in the U.S. Military in the Pacific Theater in World War II, he maintained a life-long interest in the diversity and origin of the ferns of Hawaii.  Working with his wife Florence Wagner, an accomplished cytologist, he resolved the relationships of an array of polyploid complexes in North American ferns, first the Appalachian trio of Asplenium species, then in Dryopteris and Polystichum, Wagner was most respected among his colleagues and students for his genius in discerning and articulating the differences in form between plant species in the context of their variation with environmental factors.  He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1985.  
Apparently among modern phylogenetic systematists, Wagner is alone in having been mentioned in a Hollywood film (A New Leaf, starring Elaine May and Walter Matthau).
Note: not to be confused with the American botanist Warren L. Wagner (1950- ).

[[Gorenstein ring]]

CATEGORIES: Commutative algebra

In commutative algebra, a Gorenstein local ring is a Noetherian commutative local ring R with finite injective dimension, as an R-module. There are many equivalent conditions, some of them listed below, most dealing with some sort of duality condition. 
Gorenstein rings were introduced by Grothendieck, who named them because of their relation to a duality property of singular plane curves studied by [tpl]harvs|txt|last=Gorenstein|authorlink=Daniel Gorenstein|year=1952[/tpl] (who was fond of claiming that he did not understand the definition of a Gorenstein ring). The zero-dimensional case had been studied by [tpl]harvtxt|Macaulay|1934[/tpl]. [tpl]harvtxt|Serre|1961[/tpl] and [tpl]harvtxt|Bass|1963[/tpl] publicized the concept of Gorenstein rings. 
Noncommutative analogues of 0-dimensional Gorenstein rings are called Frobenius rings.

Caniapiscau is a vast unorganized territory in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec, Canada, part of Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality.
The territory is home to the huge Caniapiscau Reservoir, the largest body of water in Quebec. The reservoir was named after Lake Caniapiscau that was flooded in 1981 during the formation of the reservoir. The name comes from the Cree or Innu term kaniapiskau or kaneapiskak which means "rocky point" or "place where there is a rocky point". Albert Peter Low had noted in 1895 that "a high rocky headland jutts into the lake." He probably referred to the northwest facing peninsula that gives the reservoir the shape of an arc as we know it now.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=150506 |title=Réservoir de Caniapiscau |publisher=Commission de toponymie du Québec |accessdate=2010-10-07 |language=French[/tpl]
In the 19th century, Lake Caniapiscau was frequented by hunters and fur traders. In 1834, the Hudson's Bay Company opened there an outpost to link its facilities in the James Bay region with those of Ungava Bay. The Kaniapiskau Post closed its doors in 1870.

In Hindu tradition, Rahu (16px) is a decapitated head of an asura, that swallows the sun causing eclipses. He is depicted in art as a serpent with no body riding a chariot drawn by eight black horses. Rahu is one of the navagrahas (nine planets) in Vedic astrology and is paired with Ketu. The time of day considered to be under the influence of Rahu is called Rahu kala and is considered inauspicious.
Astronomically, Rahu and Ketu denote the points of intersection of the paths of the Sun and the Moon as they move on the celestial sphere. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south lunar nodes. The fact that eclipses occur when the Sun and the Moon are at one of these points gives rise to the myth of the swallowing of the Sun and the Moon by the demon snake.

[[Constitutional court]]
CATEGORIES: Constitutional courts, Courts by type

A constitutional court is a high court that deals primarily with constitutional law. Its main authority is to rule on whether or not laws that are challenged are in fact unconstitutional, i.e. whether or not they conflict with constitutionally established rights and freedoms.
The list in this article is of countries that have a separate constitutional court. Many countries do not have separate constitutional courts, but instead delegate constitutional judicial authority to their supreme court. Nonetheless, such courts are sometimes also called "constitutional courts"; for example, some have called the Supreme Court of the United States "the world's oldest constitutional court" because it was the first court in the world to invalidate a law as unconstitutional (Marbury v. Madison), even though it is not a separate constitutional court.
The Constitutional Court (at the time by the name only) was the Austrian one. It had taken up its duties a year earlier in 1919 but it gained power to revise laws of the federal states only after the new Constitution was adopted later on October 10, 1920.Constitutional Court of Austria - History Czechoslovakia was the first country to adopt a Constitution which provided for review of the constitutionality of acts of parliament by a special court, on 2 February 1920, but it was not until November 1921 that the court first convened. Before that, only the U.S., Norway,Smith, Eivind (ed.) (1995). Constitutional justice under old constitutions, p. xv (Introduction, p. xi - xviii), ISBN 90-411-0042-3 and Australia had adopted the concept of judicial review through their supreme courts.

The character first appears as a date for Frasier Crane, though mutual hostility and discomfort causes the evening to end badly.  Several months later, Lilith meets Frasier again and with some help from Frasier's ex-fiancée Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), they start a romantic relationship, eventually living together, marrying, and having a son, Frederick.
In the final season of Cheers, Lilith has an affair with another man and leaves Frasier.  The affair later unravels and Lilith returns, seeking reconciliation with Frasier.  Although Cheers ended ambiguously with regard to Frasier and Lilith's marriage, at the beginning of the spin-off series Frasier, their divorce had been finalized, with Lilith gaining custody of Frederick and remaining in Boston while Frasier has moved back to his hometown of Seattle. Lilith occasionally appears in Frasier, sometimes with Frederick.

Heinrich von Stephan (January 7, 1831 – April 8, 1897) was a general post director for the German Empire who reorganized the German postal service. He was integral in the founding of the Universal Postal Union in 1874, and in 1877 introduced the telephone to Germany.
Stephan was born in Stolp (Słupsk), Pomerania, in the Kingdom of Prussia. He began his career as a local postal clerk in the service of the Prussian post in 1849. In 1866 he was put in charge by the Prussian government of federalizing the postal service that had long been privately run by the noble Thurn und Taxis family. In 1870 he was named director of postal services for the North German Confederation. Stephan's career then moved quickly up the ranks, as he was named Postmaster General of the German Empire in 1876, the Undersecretary of State in charge of the post office in 1880, and the Minister of Postal Services for Germany in 1895.
When Stephan began his work as a postal worker, Germany was divided into 17 independent states, each with its own separate policies and fees. He worked early on to establish a uniform postage rate throughout Germany, to facilitate easier mailing. His general goal of standardization and internationalization is evident in his work to combine the postal service with the telegraph service in Germany, and in his efforts to organize the International Postal Conference in Bern in 1874, in which the Universal Postal Union was established. He introduced the postcard (which he had initially suggested in 1865) to Germany after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck promoted him in 1870: the postcard came into widespread use in the subsequent Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 as a method of communication between units in the field.  He is also credited with having introduced the telephone to Germany.Huurdeman, Anton A. (2003) The Worldwide History of Telecommunications Wiley-IEEE, New York, pages 169–171, ISBN 0-471-20505-2
Stephan died in 1897 in Berlin, having made a profound impact on the standardization of mail service worldwide. He was also actively engaged in cultivating purely Germanic terminology for the field of telecommunication and postal services. The German-speaking afterworld thus gained terms such as "Fernsprechapparat" (distance-speaking-device) for telephone, "Wertzeichen" (value-sign) for stamp, "postlagernd" (post-office-stored) for poste restante and "Anschrift" (towards-lettering, analogous to "Ansprache" or "Anrede" for addressing a person or a saluation) for address. The word creations mandated by von Stephan in the 1870s gained circulation at post offices and among its workforce, but many times the Greek or French original term was retained by German speakers. Thus at home people would say "frankieren" for putting stamps on a postcard or letter envelope (Briefumschlag) among themselves, but switch to "freimachen" (absolve from stamp-debt, thus permitting delivery) when at the post office. Or at home they would say "Telefon" in everyday speech, although the arcane official term was "Fernsprecher" (remote speaker) or Fernsprechapparat. His achievements in the field of postal services far outweigh this pedantic purism and it was his proposal to have the Siemens company manufacture telephones which led to the development of an entirely new business segment for the famous German company in 1878.

The river drains a populated and economically vital area of the Colorado Western Slope called the Roaring Fork Valley or Roaring Fork Watershed, which includes the resort city of Aspen and the resorts of Aspen/Snowmass.
It rises in the Sawatch Range in eastern Pitkin County, on the west side of Independence Pass on the continental divide. It flows northwest past Aspen, Woody Creek, and Snowmass. It receives the Fryingpan River at Basalt. [tpl]convert|1.5|mi|km|0[/tpl] below Carbondale, it receives the Crystal River from the south. It joins the Colorado in Glenwood Springs. The entire area that drains into the Roaring Fork River is known as the Roaring Fork Watershed. This area is [tpl]convert|1451|sqmi|km2[/tpl] and about the same size as the state of Rhode Island. The river flows through canyons along most of its route and is a popular destination for recreation whitewater rafting. The river supplies water through the Sawatch Range to the Twin Lakes Reservoir via the Twin Lakes Tunnel. Roaring Fork Conservancy is the watershed conservation organization for the Roaring Fork River and its tributaries.
The Roaring Fork is a swift, deep, powerful river with very clear water. It is navigable by small craft throughout most of its length to its confluence with the Colorado.

[[Crystal River (Colorado)]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Gunnison County, Colorado, Geography of Pitkin County, Colorado, Rivers of Colorado, Roaring Fork Valley, Tributaries of the Colorado River in Colorado

The Crystal River is a tributary of the Roaring Fork River, approximately 40 mi (64 km) long, in western Colorado in the United States.  It drains a glacial valley, called the Valley of the Coal Miners, south of Carbondale which was historically known as a center of coal mining in southwestern Colorado. It rises in northern Gunnison County in the Elk Mountains on the north side of Schofield Pass, passing through the ghost town of Crystal City, still inhabited by a few summer residents. It then flows north past Marble, then into Pitkin County past Redstone. It joins the Roaring Fork below Carbondale. State Highway 133 follows the river along much of its route north of Marble.
From Crystal City to Marble the river flows through the Crystal River Canyon, a narrow valley with numerous snowslide runs, rockfalls, and other hazardous terrain.  Although it is locally known as a fishing and hiking attraction the unpaved and largely un-maintained mining road, designated Gunnison County Road 3 on Mapquest, is nearly impassable to vehicles other than ATVs and off-road motorcycles.  A four-wheel-drive jeep tour is operated out of Marble, but only operates during the summer when the road is not blocked by snow, mud, or rock slides. 
The 1994 comedy Maverick took place on the Crystal River.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

[[Fungicide]]

CATEGORIES: Fungicides, Mycology, Biocides

Fungicides are biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms used to kill or inhibit fungi or fungal spores.Interaction of 2,4,5-trich|orophenylsulphonylmethyl thiocyanate with fungal spores Fungi can cause serious damage in agriculture, resulting in critical losses of yield, quality, and profit. Fungicides are used both in agriculture and to fight fungal infections in animals. Chemicals used to control oomycetes, which are not fungi, are also referred to as fungicides as oomycetes use the same mechanisms as fungi to infect plants.Latijnhouwers M, de Wit PJ, Govers F. Oomycetes and fungi: similar weaponry to attack plants. Trends in Microbiology Volume 11 462-469
Fungicides can either be contact, translaminar or systemic. Contact fungicides are not taken up into the plant tissue, and protect only the plant where the spray is deposited; translaminar fungicides redistribute the fungicide from the upper, sprayed leaf surface to the lower, unsprayed surface; systemic fungicides are taken up and redistributed through the xylem vessels. Few fungicides move to all parts of a plant. Some are locally systemic, and some move upwardly.[tpl]cite web|last=Mueller|first=Daren|title=Fungicides:Terminology|url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/icm/2006/5-15/fungicides.html|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=June 1, 2013[/tpl]
Most fungicides that can be bought retail are sold in a liquid form. A very common active ingredient is sulfur,C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Sulfur. Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC present at 0.08% in weaker concentrates, and as high as 0.5% for more potent fungicides. Fungicides in powdered form are usually around 90% sulfur and are very toxic. Other active ingredients in fungicides include neem oil, rosemary oil, jojoba oil, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and the beneficial fungus Ulocladium oudemansii.
Fungicide residues have been found on food for human consumption, mostly from post-harvest treatments.Pesticide Chemistry and Bioscience edited by G.T Brooks and T.R Roberts. 1999. Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry Some fungicides are dangerous to human health, such as vinclozolin, which has now been removed from use.Hrelia et al. 1996 - The genetic and non-genetic toxicity of the fungicide Vinclozolin. Mutagenesis Volume 11 445-453 A number of fungicides are also used in human health care.

[[Refresh rate]]

CATEGORIES: Television technology, Graphics hardware

The refresh rate (most commonly the "vertical refresh rate", "vertical scan rate" for CRTs) is the number of times in a second that a display hardware updates its buffer. This is distinct from the measure of frame rate in that the refresh rate includes the repeated drawing of identical frames, while frame rate measures how often a video source can feed an entire frame of new data to a display.  
For example, most movie projectors advance from one frame to the next one 24 times each second. But each frame is illuminated two or three times before the next frame is projected using a shutter in front of its lamp. As a result, the movie projector runs at 24 frames per second, but has a 48 or 72 Hz refresh rate.
On CRT displays, increasing the refresh rate decreases flickering, thereby reducing eye strain. However, if a refresh rate is specified that is beyond what is recommended for the display, damage to the display can occur.How To Change the Screen Refresh Rate of Your Monitor in Windows XP
For computer programs or telemetry, the term is also applied to how frequently a datum is updated with a new external value from another source (for example; a shared public spreadsheet or hardware feed).

[[Quebec general election, 1962]]

CATEGORIES: 1962 elections in Canada, Snap elections, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1962 was held on November 14, 1962, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.  The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage, won re-election, defeating the Union Nationale (UN) led by Daniel Johnson, Sr..
In an unusual move, the election was called just two years after the previous 1960 general election. Lesage sought a mandate for the nationalization of the electricity industry, declaring this single issue important enough to stake his political career on it.
A few days before the election, the Union Nationale's chief organizer André Lagarde was arrested for fraud.  The Liberals claimed this was proof of lingering corruption dating from the Maurice Duplessis era, but the UN cried foul, and were vindicated after the election. However, the incident may well have contributed to the UN's defeat.
The Liberal Party won an increased number of seats and a higher percentage of the popular vote, and the nationalization program was carried out. Future Parti Québécois founder René Lévesque served as a cabinet minister in the Lesage government and spearheaded the nationalization of power utilities to greatly expand Hydro-Québec.

CATEGORIES: International Computers Limited, Companies established in 1968, Companies disestablished in 2002, Companies based in London, 1968 establishments in England

International Computers Limited, or ICL, was a large British computer hardware, computer software and computer services company that operated from 1968 until 2002.  It was formed through a merger of International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), English Electric Leo Marconi (EELM) and Elliott Automation in 1968. The company's most successful product line was the ICL 2900 Series range of mainframe computers.
In later years, ICL attempted to diversify its product line but the bulk of its profits always depended on the mainframe customer base. New ventures included marketing a range of powerful IBM clones made by Fujitsu, various minicomputer and personal computer ranges and (more successfully) a range of retail point-of-sale equipment and back-office software. Despite significant sales in overseas markets, ICL's mainframe base was dominated by large contracts from the UK public sector. Significant customers included Post Office Ltd, the Inland Revenue, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Defence. ICL also had a strong market share with UK local authorities and (at that time) nationalized utilities including the water, electricity, and gas boards. The company was eventually acquired by Fujitsu, and in April 2002 it was rebranded as Fujitsu.

[[The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 plays, Broadway plays, Drama Desk Award winning plays, Tony Award winning plays, Plays by Edward Albee

The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?, a one-act play written by Edward Albee, premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre on 10 March 2002 where it ran for 309 performances. A production opened in London in 2004. Albee's play drew film stars Bill Pullman and Mercedes Ruehl to Broadway. Ruehl was later replaced by Sally Field, and Pullman was replaced by Bill Irwin.
The tale of a married, middle-aged architect, Martin, his wife Stevie, and their son Billy, whose lives crumble when he falls in love with a goat, the play focuses on the limits of an ostensibly liberal society. Through showing this family in crisis, Albee challenges audience members to question their own morality in the face of other social taboos including infidelity, pedophilia, incest and, of course, bestiality.
The play also features many language games and grammatical arguments in the middle of catastrophes and existential disputes between the characters. The name of the play refers to the song "Who is Sylvia" from Shakespeare's play The Two Gentlemen of Verona. Proteus sings this song, hoping to woo Silvia. Franz Schubert's setting of the song contributed to its popularity outside Shakespeare's play. It is also referred to in an earlier work of Albee's, "Finding the Sun" (1982).

[[Flea market]]

CATEGORIES: Retail markets, Retailing, Reuse, Calques

A flea market (or swap meet) is a type of bazaar that rents space to people who want to sell or barter merchandise. Used goods, low quality items, and high quality items at low prices are commonplace.
Many markets offer fresh produce, unique products, old clothes, and plants from local farms. Renters of the flea market are vendors. It may be indoors, as in a warehouse or school gymnasium; or outdoors, as in a field or parking lot or under a tent. Flea markets can be held annually or semiannually, others may be conducted monthly, on weekends, or daily. Flea-market vendors may range from a family that is renting a table for the first time to sell a few unwanted household items, to scouts who rove the region buying items for sale from garage sales and other flea markets, and several staff watching the stalls.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Dictionary.com |year=1998 |accessdate=February 12, 2012 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/flea+market |title=Flea market[/tpl][tpl]cite web |work=Conjecture Corporation |year=2003 |title= What is a Flea Market? |publisher=Wisegeek.com |accessdate= February 12, 2012 |url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-flea-market.htm |title=What is a flea market?[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Americana Resources Inc.

Anthony John "Tony" Soprano is an Italian-American  fictional character and the protagonist in the HBO television drama series The Sopranos, on which he was portrayed by James Gandolfini. The character was conceived by The Sopranos[tpl]'[/tpl] creator and show runner David Chase, who was also largely responsible for the character's story arc throughout the show's six seasons. Bobby Boriello portrayed Tony Soprano as a child in one episode and Danny Petrillo played the character as a teenager in three episodes. The character is loosely based on real-life New Jersey mobster Vincent "Vinny Ocean" Palermo (born 1944), a former caporegime (capo) and de facto street boss of the DeCavalcante crime family of New Jersey. Considered to be the model for the Soprano family, several incidents involving the DeCavalcantes were incorporated into Sopranos scripts.
In the first season, Tony is a capo in the DiMeo crime family. Between the first and second seasons, he is promoted to street boss, a position he retains until the sixth season (his uncle Corrado "Junior" Soprano is the official boss up until early on in season 6, but has little or no actual power). Throughout the series, Tony struggles to balance the conflicting requirements of his "two families": his actual family—wife Carmela, daughter Meadow, son Anthony "A. J. " Soprano, Jr., and mother Livia — and the criminal organization he heads. He often displays behavior traits characteristic of a violent sociopath, but also struggles with depression and is prone to panic attacks. In the first episode he seeks treatment from Dr. Jennifer Melfi and remains in therapy on and off up until the penultimate episode of the series.
Gandolfini garnered enormous praise for this portrayal, winning three Emmy Awards for Best Lead Actor in a Drama Series, three Screen Actors Guild Awards for Best Male Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Drama Series as well as two further SAG Awards for Best Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.
Gandolfini's portrayal of the character has been cited as an influence on other cable TV protagonists, including Vic Mackey, Don Draper and Walter White.Roush, Matt (July 1, 2013). "A Soprano's Swan Song". TV Guide. pp. 18 - 21.

[[The Notion Club Papers]]
CATEGORIES: The History of Middle-earth, Unfinished novels

The Notion Club Papers is the title of an abandoned novel by J. R. R. Tolkien, written during 1945 and published posthumously in Sauron Defeated, the 9th volume of The History of Middle-earth. It is a space/time/dream travel story, written at the same time as The Lord of the Rings was being developed.  The story itself revolves around the meetings of an Oxford arts discussion group called the Notion Club, a fictionalization of (and a play on words on the name of) Tolkien's own such club, The Inklings.
During these meetings, Alwin Arundel Lowdham discusses his lucid dreams about Númenor; through these dreams, he "discovers" much about the Númenor story and the languages of Middle-earth (notably Quenya, Sindarin, and Adûnaic — the last very interesting since it is the sole source of most of the material on Adûnaic). While not finished, at the end of the given story it becomes clear Lowdham himself is a reincarnation of sorts of Elendil. (Alwin is a modernization of the name Ælfwine, Old English for Elf-friend, or Elendil in Quenya.)  Other members of the Club also mention their vivid dreams of other times and places.
Tolkien not only created fictional meetings for these papers but also created a fictional history for the manuscript of the papers. According to the papers, the meetings occurred in the 1980s; they even mention events that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. About one-quarter of the papers were found among sacks of waste paper in 2012 at Oxford by a Mr. Green. Mr. Green published a first edition containing excerpts from these papers, indicating that they were written during the 1980s by one of the participants. Two scholars read the first edition, asked to examine the manuscripts, and then submitted a full report.  The "Notes to the Second Edition" mentions the contradictory evidence in dating the manuscripts, and an alternative date is presented: they may have been written in the 1940s.
These papers, which make a number of comments on Lewis' Space Trilogy, remind one of C. S. Lewis' commentary to Tolkien's poem The Lay of Leithian, in which Lewis created a fictional history of scholarship of the poem and even referred to other manuscript tradition to recommend changes to the poem.
The Notion Club Papers may be seen as an attempt to re-write The Lost Road, published and discussed in The Lost Road and Other Writings, as being another attempt to tie the Númenórean legend in with a more modern tale.  There is, however, no direct connection between the modern settings of the two stories within the fictional frame.
Jane Stanford links 'The Notion Club Papers' to 'The Johnson Club Papers' in her biography of John O'Connor Power, 'That Irishman'.  The two books have a similar title page. The Johnson Club was a 'Public House School' and met in taverns like the Inklings. The purpose was 'Fellowship and free Exchange of Mind.' The two clubs presented papers 'which were read before the members and discussed'. Samuel Johnson, like Tolkien, had a strong connection with Pembroke College, Oxford. Stanley Unwin, Tolkien's publisher, was a nephew of Fisher Unwin, the founding member of The Johnson Club.Stanford, Jane, 'That Irishman The Life and Times of John O'Connor Power',  Part Three, pp. 115, 117-118. ISBN  978-1-84588- -698-1
According to Christopher Tolkien, had his father continued The Notion Club Papers, he would have linked the real world of Alwin Lowdham with his eponymous ancestor Ælfwine of England (who compiled the Lost Tales) and with Atlantis.  One of the members of the Notion Club, one Michael George Ramer, combines lucid dreams with time-travel and experiences the tsunami that sank Númenor.  He can't tell if its history, or fantasy, or something in between.
The Notion Club Papers mentions a great storm occurring during 1987 in England, on 12 June.  This can be seen as an odd coincidence, since the actual Great Storm of 1987 occurred in October of that year.

Like most such groups, it was founded by a Confederate veteran. Colonel Alcibiades DeBlanc founded the group on 22 May 1867 in Franklin, Louisiana. Chapters existed primarily in the southern part of the Deep South. However, unlike the Klan, which drew much of its membership from lower-class southerners (primarily Confederate veterans), the White Camelia consisted mainly of upper crust southerners, including physicians, landowners, newspaper editors, doctors, and officers. They were also usually Confederate veterans, the upper part of antebellum society. Its organizational structure had less unusual names than did the KKK. It began to decline, despite a convention in 1869. The more aggressive people joined the White League or similar paramilitary organizations that organized in the mid-1870s. By 1870 the original Knights of the White Camelia had mostly ceased to exist.Christopher Long, "KNIGHTS OF THE WHITE CAMELLIA", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed 28 June 2010  Among its members was Louisiana Judge Taylor Beattie, who led the Thibodaux massacre of 1887.
In 1939, Time Magazine reported that the West Virginian anti-Semite George E. Deatherage was describing himself as the "national commander of the Knights of the White Camellia".  In the 1990s, a Klan group based in East Texas adopted the name. According to the book "Soldiers of God", the new age White Camelia has a strong influence in Vidor, Texas. Ever since the return of the White Camelia name, so-called "White Camelia" (sometimes spelled Kamelia) Klan groups have also emerged in Louisiana & Florida.

[[Haemophilia C]]

CATEGORIES: Haemophilia

Haemophilia C is a mild form of haemophilia affecting both sexes. However, it predominantly occurs in Jews of Ashkenazi descent. It is the fourth most common coagulation disorder after von Willebrand's disease and haemophilia A and B.http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/-885719013.htm In the USA it is thought to affect 1 in 100,000 of the adult population, making it 10% as common as haemophilia A.eMedicine - Hemophilia C : Article by Prasad Mathew, MBBS, DCH
It is caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor XI and is distinguished from haemophilia A and B by the fact it does not lead to bleeding into the joints. Furthermore, it has autosomal inheritance, since the gene for factor XI is located on chromosome 4 (close to the prekallikrein gene); and it is not completely recessive, individuals who are heterozygous also show increased bleeding. Many mutations exist, and the bleeding risk is not always influenced by the severity of the deficiency. Treatment is usually not necessary, except in relation to operations, leading to many of those having the condition not being aware of it. In these cases, fresh frozen plasma or recombinant factor XI may be used, but only if necessary. The afflicted may often suffer nosebleeds, and females can experience heavy menstrual bleeding.Key facts: other bleeding disorders Haemophilia C was first discovered in a young Ashkenazic Jewish American in the 1950s.

CATEGORIES: House styles, Octagon houses, American architectural styles

Octagon houses were a unique house style briefly popular in the 1850s in the United States and Canada. They are characterised by an octagonal (eight-sided) plan, and often feature a flat roof and a veranda all round. Their unusual shape and appearance, quite different from the ornate pitched-roof houses typical of the period, can generally be traced to the influence of one man, amateur architect and lifestyle pundit Orson Squire Fowler. Although there are other octagonal houses worldwide, the term octagon house usually refers specifically to octagonal houses built in North America during this period, and up to the early 1900s.

[[Baron Hunsdon]]
CATEGORIES: Baronies in the Peerage of England, Extinct baronies in the Peerage of England, Baronies in the Peerage of the United Kingdom

Baron Hunsdon is a title that has been created twice. It was first created in 1559 in the Peerage of England for the soldier and courtier Henry Carey. His grandson, the fourth Baron, was created Viscount Rochford in 1621 and Earl of Dover, in the County of Kent, in 1628. These titles were also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He had already in 1640 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's barony of Hunsdon. However, on his death in 1677 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. The barony passed to his second cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the great-grandson of Sir Edmund Carey, younger son of the first Baron. On his death the title passed to his first cousin, the seventh Baron. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the eighth Baron. On the latter's death in 1765 the barony became extinct as well.
The title was created again in 1923 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony was revived for the businessman the Hon. Herbert Gibbs, who was made Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon, of Briggens in the County of Hertford. Gibbs was the fourth son of Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham (see the Baron Aldenham for earlier history of the family). He was a partner in the family firm of Antony Gibbs & Sons and also served as Chairman of the Public Works Loan Board. In 1908 Gibbs acquired Hunsdon House and the Briggens Estate in Hertfordshire. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. In 1939 he succeeded his cousin in the barony of Aldenham. The two baronies remain united.

He was head of the family firm of Antony Gibbs & Sons (founded by his grandfather Antony Gibbs) and a director and Governor of the Bank of England. Gibbs also briefly sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for the City of London. His fourth son Herbert Cokayne Gibbs was created Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon in 1923 (see below). Lord Aldenham was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He also represented the City of London in the House of Commons as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. On the latter's death in 1939 the barony of Aldenham was inherited by his cousin the second Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon (see the Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon for earlier history of this title). He served as chairman of Antony Gibbs & Sons. [tpl]As of|2010[/tpl] the titles are held by his grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1986.
Another member of the family to gain distinction was the Hon. Vicary Gibbs, third son of the first Baron. He was Conservative Member of Parliament for St Albans. 
The Barons Wraxall are members of another branch of the Gibbs family; their seat was at Tyntesfield. George Henry Gibbs, father of the first Baron Aldenham, was the elder brother of William Gibbs, grandfather of George Gibbs, 1st Baron Wraxall.

"The White House had a perfect deal with Miller", he said. "Chalabi is providing the Bush people with the information they need to support their political objectives, and he is supplying the same material to Judy Miller. Chalabi tips her on something and then she goes to the White House, which has already heard the same thing from Chalabi, and she gets it corroborated. She also got the Pentagon to confirm things for her, which made sense, since they were working so closely with Chalabi. Too bad Judy didn't spend a little more time talking to those of us who had information that contradicted almost everything Chalabi said."

CATEGORIES: The Sopranos characters, Fictional American people of Italian descent, Fictional heroin users, Fictional mobsters, Fictional murderers, Fictional characters from New Jersey, Fictional writers, Fictional characters introduced in 1999

Christopher Moltisanti, played by Michael Imperioli, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series The Sopranos. He is Tony Soprano's protégé and a Capo in the DiMeo crime family.
Tony Soprano has been a father figure to Christopher since the death of his father, Dickie Moltisanti. Tony affectionately refers to Christopher as his "nephew," but in fact he is a cousin of Tony's wife Carmela as well as a biological distant cousin of Tony himself. 
Christopher is a volatile and impulsive young man, frustrated by his perceived lack of progress in the business. Christopher oversteps his authority when he hijacks trucks under the protection of family boss Junior Soprano. To teach him a lesson, Junior orders a mock execution on him. Christopher shoots a bakery clerk in the foot for ignoring him, commenting "It happens," a nod to Imperioli's role in Goodfellas where he is shot in the foot by Joe Pesci's character Tommy DeVito. In the second season Chris is shot by his subordinates Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte but survives.  
Nonetheless, Tony trusts Christopher with sensitive tasks, such as disposing of the bodies of murdered capos Richie Aprile and Ralph Cifaretto, and arranging the assassination of New York boss Carmine Lupertazzi. In the third season Chris finally becomes a made man. This leads to friction with his new capo Paulie Gualtieri, culminating in the Pine Barrens incident and although they make an uneasy truce, they clash again on several occasions. By the sixth season he is promoted to capo, and Tony tells Christopher that he will lead the family into the 21st century.
Christopher has a tumultuous and abusive relationship with his long-term girlfriend Adriana La Cerva. He comes close to death when, enraged about rumors that his fiancée Adriana and Tony are having an affair, he pulls a gun on Tony, who is ready to kill him for the insult. He is spared only after Tony Blundetto intercedes for him. In the fifth season Chris learns that Adriana has been working as an informant for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and that she wants them to go into the Witness Protection Program. Valuing loyalty over love, Christopher reports Adriana's actions to Tony, who has Silvio Dante kill her.
Christopher then marries his new girlfriend Kelli Lombardo and they have a daughter, Caitlyn, but his interest in his new wife soon wanes. He grows disillusioned with Tony and frustrated with his progress in the family, and distances himself from the business by making a film and trying to become a Hollywood screenwriter. 
Christopher struggles throughout the series with major drug and alcohol addictions and repeatedly spends time at AA and drug rehabilitation centers. Despite wanting Christopher to succeed, Tony doubts his nephew's loyalty and suitability to be his successor, and he fears that Christopher's immaturity and frequent drug problems make him a ripe target to turn state's evidence. Christopher's efforts to stay clean of drugs and alcohol cause him to spend less time at their regular haunts, which further arouses Tony's suspicions. After Adriana's death, Christopher relapses into heroin abuse, and he causes a car crash as he is driving Tony home while high. After seeing that Caitlyn's baby seat has been completely destroyed in the accident, Tony suffocates the injured Chris and is finally rid of his troublesome nephew.
The character of Christopher contains various nods to actor Michael Imperioli's own life and career. Like Imperioli, Chris is a film and television buff with ambitions to be a scriptwriter (Imperioli wrote several episodes of the series), and there are references to Imperioli's appearances in Goodfellas and Dead Presidents. After auditioning for the role of Christopher, Imperioli thought that series creator David Chase was unimpressed with his audition and thus was surprised to be offered the part. Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had appeared in Goodfellas.

Bayesian spam filtering ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|z|i|ə|n[/tpl] [tpl]respell|BAY|zee-ən[/tpl]; after Rev. Thomas Bayes) is a statistical technique of e-mail filtering. In its basic form, it makes use of a naive Bayes classifier on bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text classification.
Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayesian inference to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.
Naive Bayes spam filtering is a baseline technique for dealing with spam that can tailor itself to the email needs of individual users and give low false positive spam detection rates that are generally acceptable to users. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.

[[Peter Bichsel]]

CATEGORIES: 1935 births, Living people, Swiss writers, Swiss short story writers

Peter Bichsel (born March 24, 1935) is a popular Swiss-German writer and journalist representing modern German literature. He was a member of the Gruppe Olten.
Bichsel was born 1935 in Lucerne, Switzerland, the son of manual labourers. Shortly after he was born, the Bichsels moved to Olten, also in Switzerland. After finishing school, he became an elementary school teacher, a job which he held until 1968. From 1974 to 1981 he was the personal advisor of Willy Ritschard, a member of the Swiss Federal Council. Between 1972 and 1989 he made his mark as a "writer in residence" and a guest lecturer at American universities. Bichsel has lived on the outskirts of Solothurn for several decades.
One of his first and most well-known works is And Really Frau Blum Would Very Much Like to Meet the Milkman. Just as successful, Children's Stories, intended for adults, is written in the form of droll tales for children. Both books were translated from the German by English poet Michael Hamburger. A theme of Bichsel's works for younger readers is the stubborn desire of children to take words literally and wreak havoc on the world of communicated ideas. In the early 1970s and 1980s, Bichsel's journalistic work pushed his literary work mainly into the background. Only Der Busant (1985) and Warten in Baden-Baden appeared again with the Bichsel style that was so familiar to German readers. Peter Bichsel gave up being a professional teacher early in his lifetime, yet he has continued to teach his readers that the drudgery and banality of life is of our own making. Conversely, we have every opportunity to prevent our lives from being boring. This theme has helped make Peter Bichsel a symbol of German literary work today.
In 1981, he was a member of the jury at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1981/04_jury_1981/04_Jury_1981.html |title=Berlinale 1981: Juries |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |work=berlinale.de[/tpl]

The Charles Bridge ([tpl]lang-cs|Karlův most[/tpl] [tpl]Audio|Cs-Karluv most.ogg|listen[/tpl]) is a famous historic bridge that crosses the Vltava river in Prague, Czech Republic. Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century. The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158–1172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342. This new bridge was originally called the Stone Bridge (Kamenný most) or the Prague Bridge (Pražský most) but has been the "Charles Bridge" since 1870. As the only means of crossing the river Vltava (Moldau) until 1841, the Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. This "solid-land" connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe.
The bridge is 621 m long and nearly 10 m wide, resting on 16 arches shielded by ice guards. It is protected by three bridge towers, two of them on the Lesser Quarter side and the third one on the Old Town side. The Old Town bridge tower is often considered to be one of the most astonishing civil gothic-style buildings in the world. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700 but now all replaced by replicas.

[[Egyptian Revival architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural styles, Egyptian Revival architecture, Revival architectural styles

Egyptian Revival is an architectural style that uses the motifs and imagery of ancient Egypt. It is attributed generally to the public awareness of ancient Egyptian monuments generated by Napoleon's conquest of Egypt and Admiral Nelson's defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Napoleon took a scientific expedition with him to Egypt. Publication of the expedition's work, the Description de l'Égypte, began in 1809 and was published as a series through 1826. However, works of art and architecture (such as funerary monuments) in the Egyptian style had been made or built occasionally on the European continent and the British Isles since the time of the Renaissance.

[[Undefined behavior]]
CATEGORIES: Programming language implementation, C programming language, C++, Articles with example C++ code

In computer programming, undefined behavior refers to computer code whose behavior is specified to be arbitrary. It is a feature of some programming languages—most famously C.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html |title=What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior |first=Chris |last=Lattner |authorlink=Chris Lattner |date=May 13, 2011 |work=LLVM Project Blog |publisher=LLVM.org |accessdate=May 24, 2011[/tpl] In these languages the semantics of certain operations are undefined, so an implementation can assume that such operations never occur in program code, since the implementation will be correct whatever it does in such cases analogously to don't-care terms in digital logic. This assumption can make various program transformations valid or simplify their proof of correctness giving flexibility to the implementation. It is the responsibility of the programmer to write code that never invokes undefined behaviour, but an implementation is allowed to print diagnostics when it happens.
For example, in C the use of any automatic variable before it has been initialized yields undefined behavior, as does division by zero or indexing an array outside of its defined bounds (see buffer overflow). In general, any behavior afterwards is also undefined. In particular, it is never required that the compiler diagnose undefined behavior — therefore, programs invoking undefined behavior may compile and run without apparent failures or fail in seemingly unrelated ways, or behave seemingly inconsistently with the source code.
Under some circumstances there can be specific restrictions on undefined behavior. For example, the instruction set specifications of a CPU might leave the behavior of some forms of an instruction undefined, but if the CPU supports memory protection then the specification will probably include a blanket rule stating that no user-accessible instruction may cause a hole in the operating system's security; so an actual CPU would be permitted to corrupt any or all user registers in response to such an instruction but would not be allowed to, for example, switch into supervisor mode.
In C and C++, implementation-defined behavior is also used, where the language standard does not specify the behavior, but the implementation must choose a behavior and needs to document and observe the rules it chose. These standards also use unspecified behavior to mean that from a given set of possibilities it is not specified which behaviour an implementation must choose, it need not document the choice or even be consistent, but it must choose one possibility.

Force Five is an American adaptation of five different anime television series. In the United States, this series was primarily shown only in New England, Pennsylvania and Virginia, though it did make brief appearances in other markets, such as Dallas, Texas and San Jose, California on KICU-TV 36. It was also shown in Toronto, Canada on CFMT channel 47. It was produced by Jim Terry and his company American Way, and consisted of five imported Japanese giant robot serials (originally produced in the mid-1970s by Toei Animation) in response to the popularity of the Shogun Warriors toy collection (in fact, Mattel was one of the sponsors).
In an anthology style, the five shows were broadcast simultaneously with one episode of each serial assigned a specific weekday. Additionally, all of the shows were edited into two-hour movies and marketed on video tape by Family Home Entertainment. In the UK the video company Krypton Force released several of these cartoons, but under different series titles.
Force Five consisted of the following five series:
Great Mazinger was supposed to be among the five shows, but the deal to pick up the series fell through, so Starzinger (Spaceketeers) was picked up instead of this. Gaiking[tpl]'[/tpl]s instrumental version of its theme song was actually re-used to be the ending song for the series, rather than using an original song.

[[Brokaw bandgap reference]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic circuits, Analog circuits

Brokaw bandgap reference is a voltage reference circuit widely used in integrated circuits, with an output voltage around 1.25 V with only little temperature dependence. This particular circuit is one type of a bandgap voltage reference, named after the author of its first publication.Brokaw, P., "A simple three-terminal IC bandgap reference", IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 9, pp. 388–393, December 1974.
Like all temperature-independent bandgap references, the circuit maintains an internal voltage source that has a positive temperature coefficient and another internal voltage source that has a negative temperature coefficient. By summing the two together, the temperature dependence can be canceled. Additionally, either of the two internal sources can be used as a temperature sensor.
In the Brokaw bandgap reference, the circuit uses negative feedback (e.g., an operational amplifier) to force a constant current through two bipolar transistors with different emitter areas. By the Ebers–Moll model of a transistor,
The circuit output is the sum of the base–emitter voltage difference with one of the base–emitter voltages. With proper component choices, the two opposing temperature coefficients will cancel each other exactly and the output will have no temperature dependence.

Rían is a name of Irish Gaelic origin.
In J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, Rían was a woman of the First House of the Edain in the First Age. She was the daughter of Belegund of the House of Bëor and cousin of Morwen Edhelwen. Her son was Tuor Eladar and her great-grandson Elrond Half-elven.
Rían was only a young child during the Dagor Bragollach of [tpl]ME-date|YS|455[/tpl], when her land was sacked and people slain or fled. Belegund then became a companion of his uncle Barahir and remained defending the land until they were slain in 460. Emeldir the Manhearted, wife of Barahir, led the remaining women and children to safety over the Ered Gorgoroth, and Rían was among those who in the end came to Hithlum.
She was well received there, and in 472 she wedded Huor of the House of Marach, whose brother Húrin was married to Rían's cousin Morwen and was now Lord of Dor-lómin. But two months after their wedding Huor went to the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, and was slain.
No news of the battle came to Dor-lómin, and pregnant Rían became distraught and fled into the wild. She was found by the Grey-elves and taken to their dwellings in the Mountains of Mithrim. Before the end of the year she gave birth to a son, Tuor, but left him to the fostering of the Elves and departed, seeking tidings of her husband. She came to the hill of slain, Haudh-en-Ndengin, amid the wastes of Anfauglith, and there she laid herself down and died.[tpl]ME-ref|Silm|"Of Túrin Turambar"[/tpl]

Previously, some districts elected 2 or 3 members; the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that this was not allowed under the North Carolina Constitution of 1971. 
These elections resulted in Democratic control of the North Carolina Senate with a 28-22 majority.  The House of Representatives was won by the Republicans by a wafer-thin 61-59 majority.  However, Michael P. Decker crossed the floor between the election and the opening of the new session, making it evenly split 60-60.

[[Die schöne Müllerin]]
CATEGORIES: Lieder composed by Franz Schubert, Classical song cycles, 1823 compositions

Die schöne Müllerin (Op. 25, D. 795), is a song cycle by Franz Schubert based on poems by Wilhelm Müller. It is the earliest extended song cycle to be widely performed. The work is considered one of Schubert's most important cycles, and one of the pinnacles of Lied, and it is widely performed and recorded.
Die schöne Müllerin is performed by a pianist and a solo singer. The vocal part falls in the range of a tenor or soprano voice, but is often sung by other voices, transposed to a lower range. Since the story of the cycle is about a young man, the work is most often sung by men. The piano part bears much of the expressive burden of the work, and is only seldom a mere "accompaniment" to the singer.
A typical performance lasts around sixty to seventy minutes.

CATEGORIES: Electronic circuits, Analog circuits

A bandgap voltage reference is a temperature independent voltage reference circuit widely used in integrated circuits. It produces a fixed (constant) voltage irrespective of power supply variations, temperature changes and the loading on the device. Usually it has an output voltage around 1.25 V, close to the theoretical 1.22 eV bandgap of silicon at 0 K.  This circuit concept was first published by David Hilbiber in 1964.[ref]

[[Discretization error]]
CATEGORIES: Numerical analysis

In numerical analysis, computational physics, and simulation, discretization error (or truncation error) is error resulting from the fact that a function of a continuous variable is represented in the computer by a finite number of evaluations, for example, on a lattice.  Discretization error can usually be reduced by using a more finely spaced lattice, with an increased computational cost.

The genus is confined to North America, with the center of its distribution in California. Some species (e.g. C. americanus) are found in the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g. C. coeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs 0.5–3 m tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both from California, can be small trees up to 6–7 m tall.  The name is derived from the Greek word κεανοθος (keanothos), which was applied by Theophrastus (371-287 BC) to a spiny Old World plant believed to be Cirsium arvense.[tpl]cite book | author=Elmore, Francis H. | title=Trees and Shrubs of the Southwest Uplands | publisher=Western National Parks Association | year=1976 | pages = 195 | isbn = 0-911408-41-X[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=eS7lX_rC3GEC |first=Daniel F. |last=Austin |title=Florida Ethnobotany |publisher=CRC Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8493-2332-4 |page=291[/tpl]

The President of Trinidad and Tobago is the head of state of Trinidad and Tobago, and the commander in chief of its armed forces.  The office was established when the country became a republic in 1976, before which the head of state was Queen Elizabeth II. The last Governor-General, Sir Ellis Clarke, was sworn in as the first President on August 1 of that year, under a transitional arrangement. He was formally chosen as President by an electoral college consisting of members of both houses of Parliament on September 24, 1976, which is now celebrated as Republic Day.
Under the 1976 Constitution, the President is the nominal source of executive power.  Like the British Sovereign (and heads of state in other Westminster Systems), he or she "reigns but does not rule".  In practice, executive authority is exercised by the Prime Minister and his or her Cabinet, on behalf of the President.  The President appoints as Prime Minister the leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives, and also appoints members of the Senate on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.  The President must be at least 35 years old (although no President has been younger than 59), a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, and at the time of nomination must have been resident in the country for an unbroken period of ten years. 
The current President of Trinidad and Tobago is Anthony Carmona. The official residence of the President is President's House, previously used by the Governors-General of the islands.

CATEGORIES: Projectors, Optoelectronics, Texas Instruments hardware, Display technology

Digital Light Processing (DLP)  is a type of projector technology that uses a digital micromirror device. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997.  Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the DLP projector technology.  DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. 
DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), DLP rear projection television sets, and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection, and in additive manufacturing as a power source in some printers to cure resins into solid 3D objects.

[[Database and Collections of Information Misappropriation Act]]

The Database and Collections of Information Misappropriation Act, [tpl]USBill|108|H.R.|3261[/tpl], was a proposed bill in the United States House of Representatives during the 108th United States Congress. It would have altered copyright law to permit assertion of copyright ownership over factual data.
Proponents argued that the bill was based on the 1996 EU Database Directive, and was designed to encourage database creators by ensuring their revenue advantage. Opponents, who included Google and Verizon argued that it would restrict access to and use of facts. 
In March 2004, the House Energy and Commerce Committee unfavorably reported H.R. 3261. The committee approved a competing, less comprehensive bill, the Consumer Access to Information Act [tpl]USBill|108|H.R.|3872[/tpl], which dealt only with "time sensitive" information, and would have instructed the Federal Trade Commission to take action against unfair trade practices.

[[Equipartition theorem]]
CATEGORIES: Concepts in physics, Thermodynamics, Statistical mechanics theorems

In classical statistical mechanics, the equipartition theorem is a general formula that relates the temperature of a system with its average energies. The equipartition theorem is also known as the law of equipartition, equipartition of energy, or simply equipartition. The original idea of equipartition was that, in thermal equilibrium, energy is shared equally among all of its various forms; for example, the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom in the translational motion of a molecule should equal that of its rotational motions.
The equipartition theorem makes quantitative predictions. Like the virial theorem, it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system's heat capacity can be computed. However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring. For example, it predicts that every atom in a monatomic ideal gas has an average kinetic energy of (3/2)kBT in thermal equilibrium, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the (thermodynamic) temperature. More generally, it can be applied to any classical system in thermal equilibrium, no matter how complicated. The equipartition theorem can be used to derive the ideal gas law, and the Dulong–Petit law for the specific heat capacities of solids. It can also be used to predict the properties of stars, even white dwarfs and neutron stars, since it holds even when relativistic effects are considered.
Although the equipartition theorem makes very accurate predictions in certain conditions, it becomes inaccurate when quantum effects are significant, such as at low temperatures.  When the thermal energy kBT is smaller than the quantum energy spacing in a particular degree of freedom, the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition. Such a degree of freedom is said to be "frozen out" when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing. For example, the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out, rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition. Such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new, more subtle, scientific model was required. Along with other evidence, equipartition's failure to model black-body radiation—also known as the ultraviolet catastrophe—led Max Planck to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object, which emit light, were quantized, a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

[[Singularitarianism]]

Singularitarianism is a technocentric ideology and social movement defined by the belief that a technological singularity—the creation of superintelligence—will likely happen in the medium future, and that deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the Singularity benefits humans.
Singularitarians are distinguished from other futurists who speculate on a technological singularity by their belief that the Singularity is not only possible, but desirable if guided prudently. Accordingly, they might sometimes dedicate their lives to acting in ways they believe will contribute to its rapid yet safe realization.[tpl]cite book| last = Kurzweil | first = Raymond | title = The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology | publisher = Viking Adult| year = 2005 | isbn = 0-670-03384-7| oclc = 224517172[/tpl]
Time Magazine describes the worldview of Singularitarians by saying that "they think in terms of deep time, they believe in the power of technology to shape history, they have little interest in the conventional wisdom about anything, and they cannot believe you're walking around living your life and watching TV as if the artificial-intelligence revolution were not about to erupt and change absolutely everything." "2045: The Year Man Becomes Immortal" Time Magazine, February 2011
Some critics argue that Singularitarianism is a new religious movement promising salvation in a technological utopia.[tpl]citation | last = Geraci | first = Robert M. | title = The Cult of Kurzweil: Will Robots Save Our Souls? | year = 2011 | url = http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/4456/the_cult_of_kurzweil%3A_will_robots_save_our_souls/ |publisher= Religion Dispatches| accessdate = 2012-03-02[/tpl].

[[Transverse mode]]
CATEGORIES: Wave mechanics, Electromagnetic radiation, Laser science

A transverse mode of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is a particular electromagnetic field pattern of radiation measured in a plane perpendicular (i.e., transverse) to the propagation direction of the beam. Transverse modes occur in radio waves and microwaves confined to a waveguide, and also in light waves in an optical fiber and in a laser's optical resonator."Transverse electromagnetic mode"
Transverse modes occur because of boundary conditions imposed on the wave by the waveguide. For example, a radio wave in a hollow metal waveguide must have zero tangential electric field amplitude at the walls of the waveguide, so the transverse pattern of the electric field of waves is restricted to those that fit between the walls. For this reason, the modes supported by a waveguide are quantized. The allowed modes can be found by solving Maxwell's equations for the boundary conditions of a given waveguide.

Dmitry Grigoriyevich Bogrov (1887 – 24 September 1911) ([tpl]Lang-ru|Дмитрий Григорьевич Богров[/tpl]) was the assassin of the Russian Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin.
Born Mordekhai Gershkovich Bogrov ([tpl]Lang-ru|Мордехай Гершкович Богров[/tpl])[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] into a family of Jewish merchants in Kiev (Russian Empire), Bogrov, while simultaneously acting as an anarchist revolutionary, had been an agent of the Okhrana secret police since 1906, informing on the activities of Socialist Revolutionaries, Social Democrats and anarchists.Riasanovsky, Nicholas V., and Mark D. Steinberg. A history of Russia. Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 412.
On 14 September 1911, Dmitry Bogrov shot the Russian prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, in the Kiev Opera House, in front of Tsar Nicholas II and two of his daughters. Stolypin died four days later. This act was committed ostensibly in order to decapitate a successful and popular conservative reform movement and thus hasten violent revolution. Bogrov was also attempting to stop the anti-Jewish pogroms that Stolypin was inciting. However, it has been alleged that Bogrov was permitted to act at the behest of extreme right-wing elements in the Tsarist secret police who detested Stolypin because of his agrarian reforms and his flair for parliamentary government. (Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn extensively investigates and gives full credit to this conjecture in his historical novel August 1914.)
Bogrov was tried by the district military court. Despite the plea of Stolypin's widow to the court to save Bogrov's life (she said that taking the young man's life would not bring her husband back), Bogrov was sentenced to death and executed by hanging on [tpl]OldStyleDate|September 24|1911|September 11[/tpl] in the Kiev fortress of Lysa Hora.
Significantly, the investigation of Stolypin's assassination was later discontinued at the express order of Nicholas II.

Myron Waldman (April 23, 1908 – February 4, 2006) was an American animator, best known for his work at Fleischer Studio.
Waldman was born in Brooklyn, New York on April 23, 1908.  He was a graduate of the Pratt Institute, where he majored in Art. He started his first career work in 1930 at Fleischer Studio.  At Fleischer he worked on Betty Boop, Raggedy Ann, Gulliver's Travels, the animated adaptations of Superman, and Popeye.  He was head animator on two Academy Award nominated shorts, Educated Fish (1937) and Hunky and Spunky (1939).
Waldman made the transition when Fleischer Studios was foreclosed on by Paramount Pictures and reorganized as Famous Studios in 1942.  At Famous he worked mostly on the Casper the Friendly Ghost series. In 1958 he left Famous to become an animation director at Hal Seeger Productions where he worked on the revival of the Out of the Inkwell series, as well as Milton the Monster, until his retirement in 1968.
Outside of animation, Waldman partnered with writer Steve Carlin in 1940 to produce the Happy the Humbug comic strip.[tpl]cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]  He also created one of the first graphic novels, the wordless novel Eve: A Pictorial Love Story (1943).[tpl]sfn|Beronä|2008|p=170[/tpl]
In 1986 Waldman received the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Award, and in 1997 was given the Winsor McCay Award for his lifetime work in the field of animation.  Waldman died of congestive heart failure on February 4, 2006, at the age of 97 in Bethpage, New York.

The show, a production of the Children's Television Workshop, teaches scientific principles and their applications. Dr. Edward G.

The Bloodhound Gang is a series of segments within the PBS television program 3-2-1 Contact[tpl]cite web|title=3-2-1 Contact|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190169/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=5 February 2013[/tpl]  about three young people who solved crimes, largely with the help of their knowledge of science. The series was produced for 3-2-1 Contact by Daniel Wilson Productions, Inc.
During 3-2-1 Contact's first season, the Bloodhound Gang consisted of Victoria "Vikki" Allen (played by Nan-Lynn Nelson), Ricardo Lopez (Marcelino Sánchez), and two "junior" detectives who were alternated between different mysteries: Zach Morgan (Kelly Pease) and Cuff (Glenn Scarpelli).  Starting with the second season in 1983, Zach and Cuff were replaced by a new junior detective, Skip (Seth Greenspan).
The Bloodhound Gang got its name from Mr. James Bloodhound (conceivably a private detective) who was most often absent from his office, presumably dealing with adult-oriented cases.  Whenever a youth of the Bloodhound Gang would answer the phone, they would say, "Bloodhound Detective Agency. Whenever there's trouble, we're there on the double!" ("Mr. Bloodhound isn't here." is often added in case Bloodhound is absent) and accept cases suited to their age, such as exposing frauds. 
The Bloodhound Gang segments were short, and most (though not all) adventures lasted multiple episodes.  If an episode of 3-2-1 Contact ran too long (usually on Friday episodes), an announcement would tell viewers that The Bloodhound Gang would not be presented in said episode.
The segments began with a theme song sung by Dámaris Carbaugh:
The Bloodhound Gang was discontinued in 3-2-1 Contact's sixth season, following the death of Sánchez in 1986.  However, reruns from previous seasons were shown sporadically during the seventh season.
The Bloodhound Gang mysteries were written by Newbery Medal-winning children's author Sid Fleischman.

The Fish River (Visrivier in Afrikaans, Fischfluss in German) is a river in Namibia.  It is 650 km long, flowing from Hardap Dam near Mariental.  The flow of the river is seasonal; in winter the river can dry up completely.  Despite this, the river is the site of the spectacular Fish River Canyon, a canyon 160 km long, and at points as much as 550 m deep.
The outflow of the Fish River joins the Orange River at the border with South Africa about 100 km from the Atlantic Ocean.

The Quebec general election of 1944 was held on August 8, 1944 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.  The Union Nationale, led by former premier Maurice Duplessis, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Adélard Godbout.  This was the first provincial election in which women were allowed to vote, having been granted suffrage at the provincial level in 1940 and at the federal level in 1919.
This election marked Duplessis's comeback after having defeated Godbout in the 1936 election and having lost to him in the 1939 election.  Duplessis won another three elections in a row, for a total of five terms of office (four consecutive), before dying in office in 1959.
In this wartime election, Godbout's support for Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in the Conscription Crisis of 1944 may have contributed to his defeat.
The Bloc Populaire won four seats on an anti-conscription platform. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (predecessor of the New Democratic Party) won one seat. Party member David Côté was elected to the legislature, but in July 1945, he decided to sit as an independent.

The Action libérale nationale, which had won 25 seats in the 1935 election and then merged with the Quebec Conservative Party, was re-formed by Paul Gouin, who had split with Duplessis soon after the formation of the Union Nationale.  However the ALN obtained only 4.5% of the vote and no seats. It soon disbanded.  Also, a rump Conservative Party ran three candidates who won 0.2% of the vote and no seats. This party also disbanded.

The Quebec general election of 1936 was held on August 17, 1936 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.  The Union Nationale, led by Maurice Duplessis, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Adélard Godbout.
This marked the end of slightly more than 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals, who had governed Quebec since the 1897 election.
This 1936 election had been called less than one year after the 1935 election after Liberal premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau resigned because of a scandal. He was replaced by Godbout as Liberal leader and premier.
This was Duplessis's first term in office.  After losing the subsequent 1939 election, he later won four more general elections in a row, and became the dominant politician of his time. It was also the Union Nationale's first election, having been formed from a merger between the Action libérale nationale and the Quebec Conservative Party.

Silvio Manfred Dante, often referred to as "Sil", played by Steven Van Zandt, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series The Sopranos. He is the consigliere to Tony Soprano in the Soprano crime family. Silvio has one of the lowest profiles on the show. He is usually a behind the scenes figure and tries not to draw much attention to himself. He does very well at maintaining a legitimate business image as the manager and owner of the Bada Bing strip club. Silvio usually keeps his cool in even the worst situations but has been known to unleash his terrible fury and excessive anger when necessary (or when playing poker), revealing a temper comparable to his peers'. Silvio is a movie and film connoisseur and has an encyclopedic mind for movie lines. Throughout the series, he entertains the other members of the crew by getting into character and mimicking Michael Corleone's remark in the The Godfather Part III: "Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in." Silvio is one of the most loyal mobsters in the Soprano crime family. He is notorious on the show for executing F.B.I. informants and traitors.

The Nazca Plate, named after the Nazca region of southern Peru, is an oceanic tectonic plate in the eastern Pacific Ocean basin off the west coast of South America. The ongoing subduction, along the Peru-Chile Trench, of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate is largely responsible for the Andean orogeny. The Nazca Plate is bounded on the west by the Pacific Plate and to the south by the Antarctic Plate through the East Pacific Rise and the Chile Rise respectively. The movement of the Nazca Plate over several hotspots has created some volcanic islands as well as east-west running seamount chains that subduct under South America. Nazca is a relatively young plate both in terms of the age of its rocks and its existence as an independent plate having been formed from the break-up of the Farallon Plate about 23 million years ago. The oldest rocks of the plate are about 50 million years old.[tpl]cite web|title= Sea Floor Spreading in the Pacific |first=Steven|last=Dutch|url=https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/PacificSFS-PB.HTM[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Fluorone dyes, Staining dyes, Fluorescent dyes, Laser gain media, Phenols, Benzoic acids

Fluorescein is a synthetic organic compound available as a dark orange/red powder slightly soluble in water and alcohol. It is widely used as a fluorescent tracer for many applications.
Fluorescein is a fluorophore commonly used in microscopy, in a type of dye laser as the gain medium, in forensics and serology to detect latent blood stains, and in dye tracing. Fluorescein has an absorption maximum at 494 nm and emission maximum of 521 nm (in water). The major derivatives are fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and, in oligonucleotide synthesis, 6-FAM phosphoramidite.
Fluorescein also has an isosbestic point (equal absorption for all pH values) at 460 nm. Fluorescein is also known as a color additive (D&C Yellow no. 7).  The disodium salt form of fluorescein is known as uranine or D&C Yellow no. 8.
The color of its aqueous solution varies from green to orange as a function of the way it is observed: by reflection or by transmission, as it can be noticed in bubble levels in which fluorescein is added as a colorant to the alcohol filling the tube to increase the visibility of the air bubble and the precision of the instrument. More concentrated solutions of fluorescein can even appear red.

[[Junior Soprano]]

CATEGORIES: The Sopranos characters, Fictional American people of Italian descent, Fictional mobsters, Fictional World War II veterans, Fictional characters introduced in 1999

Corrado John Soprano, Jr., played by Dominic Chianese, is a fictional character from the HBO TV series The Sopranos. Usually referred to as "Junior" or "Uncle Jun'", is for most of the series the official boss of the DiMeo crime family. He is the mentor and surrogate father for his nephew and DiMeo crime family capo Tony Soprano. A younger Corrado sometimes appears in flashbacks and is played by Rocco Sisto. Although Junior is portrayed as conniving and deceitful in the first season, he shows a more considerate and humorous side of him in the later seasons and reveals a sensitive side during his illness and house arrest, making the audience feel a slight bit of sympathy and compassion for him.
Junior is portrayed as an arrogant, selfish, misanthropic and impulsive character. In Mafia jargon, he "ate alone." Junior was very envious of others who held an advantage or position of superiority over him (especially towards his own family). He had an uneasy relationship with his nephew Tony Soprano, for his fast ascendancy as a star of the family and their often conflicting business interests. Although Junior never directly murders anyone on the show, in Season One, he orders the murders of six people, including Brendan Filone and the unsuccessful hit on Tony after he believed Tony was conspiring against him. He also ordered a mock execution on Christopher Moltisanti for hijacking one of his trucks.
After a brief power struggle during season one, Tony stood aside and allowed Junior to become boss of the family. Shortly afterwards Junior was indicted for racketeering and placed under house arrest, leaving Tony as de facto boss. He would spend the next three seasons awaiting trial and trying to avoid prosecution on the grounds of his failing health, whilst struggling to cope with his virtual imprisonment; he was only allowed to leave the house for doctors' appointments and funerals. Eventually a member of Junior's crew managed to intimidate one of the jurors, resulting in a mis-trial. Over this period Junior's mental state gradually deteriorated, resulting in him shooting Tony, believing him to be his old enemy Pussy Malanga. He was subsequently committed to a psychiatric hospital. When Tony visited him for the last time, it was apparent that Junior was in the advanced stages of dementia, as he did not even recognize his nephew.
The Junior Soprano character may have been loosely based on the real life presumed boss of the Gambino crime family, Peter Gotti, with similarities in look, age, inheritance of the leadership from his nephew, John A. Gotti, and his relationship with longtime girlfriend Marjorie Alexander. Likewise, his attempt to feign mental illness in order to escape indictment for his crimes mirrors the real life case of Genovese crime family boss Vincent Gigante. According to series creator David Chase the name Junior was taken from one of his own older cousins.

In information theory, a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code is a linear error correcting code, a method of transmitting a message over a noisy transmission channel,David J.C. MacKay (2003) Information theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms, CUP, ISBN 0-521-64298-1, (also available online)Todd K. Moon (2005) Error Correction Coding, Mathematical Methods and Algorithms. Wiley, ISBN 0-471-64800-0 (Includes code) and is constructed using a sparse bipartite graph.Amin Shokrollahi (2003) LDPC Codes: An Introduction LDPC codes are capacity-approaching codes, which means that practical constructions exist that allow the noise threshold to be set very close (or even arbitrarily close on the BEC) to the theoretical maximum (the Shannon limit) for a symmetric memoryless channel. The noise threshold defines an upper bound for the channel noise, up to which the probability of lost information can be made as small as desired. Using iterative belief propagation techniques, LDPC codes can be decoded in time linear to their block length.
LDPC codes are finding increasing use in applications requiring reliable and highly efficient information transfer over bandwidth or return channel-constrained links in the presence of corrupting noise. Implementation of LDPC codes has lagged behind that of other codes, notably turbo codes. The fundamental patent for Turbo Codes expired on August 29, 2013.[https://www.google.com/patents/US5446747 US5446747NewScientist, Communication speed nears terminal velocity, by Dana Mackenzie, 9 July 2005

[[Rayleigh quotient iteration]]
CATEGORIES: Numerical linear algebra

Rayleigh quotient iteration is an eigenvalue algorithm which extends the idea of the inverse iteration by using the Rayleigh quotient to obtain increasingly accurate eigenvalue estimates.
Rayleigh quotient iteration is an iterative method, that is, it must be repeated until it converges to an answer (this is true for all eigenvalue algorithms).  Fortunately, very rapid convergence is guaranteed and no more than a few iterations are needed in practice.  The Rayleigh quotient iteration algorithm converges cubically for Hermitian or symmetric matrices, given an initial vector that is sufficiently close to an eigenvector of the matrix that is being analyzed.

[[Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]

CATEGORIES: Structure of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), often referred to as the Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee, was responsible for the central administration of the party as opposed to drafting government policy which was usually handled by the Politburo. Its members were elected by the Communist Party's Central Committee, although in all but the first years of its existence the elections were a formality since decisions were made by the senior leadership before the voting. The General Secretary of the CPSU, who was also a Politburo member, was the leader of the Secretariat and the Party. Dual membership in the Secretariat and the Politburo was reserved for two or three very senior members of the Soviet leadership and in the post-Joseph Stalin era was a stepping stone to the ultimate power. The last five Soviet leaders (Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko and Mikhail Gorbachev) were all senior Secretaries before becoming First or General Secretaries.  Additionally, Georgy Malenkov was briefly reckoned as the leader of the party for a week after Stalin's death by virtue of being the top member of the Secretariat.
The Secretariat was established by the Central Committee on 6 August 1917 and was initially composed of Felix Dzerzhinsky, Matvei Muranov and Yakov Sverdlov as full members and Adolph Joffe and Elena Stasova as candidate members (or alternates). Following the October Revolution of 1917, Sverdlov and Stasova in effect handled the work of the Secretariat as the other members of the body assumed other duties. At the time, the Secretariat wasAlan Bullock, Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives, p. 121-124. responsible for technical issues such as coordination of the activities of regional party organizations and handling routine administrative affairs of the Party. Its staff increased from just 30 in 1919 to 600 in 1921 and 767 by 1925.
By 1922, the body had been transformed from a technical committee to one of the most important components of the party and from that point on it was responsible for day to day operations of the Communist Party. Also in 1922, the position of General Secretary was created, the General Secretary became the head of the Secretariat and, in the years following Lenin's death, became the most important figure in the party and the country.

Mercier had been accused of corruption and removed from office as Premier by Quebec Lieutenant-governor Auguste-Réal Angers on December 16, 1891.  The scandal probably influenced the outcome of the election.  Mercier gave up the post of Liberal leader (and leader of the Opposition) to Félix-Gabriel Marchand, and was later acquitted of all charges.
Boucher de Boucherville resigned a year later, and was replaced by Louis-Olivier Taillon as Conservative leader and premier. Taillon in turn resigned in 1896, and was replaced by Edmund James Flynn.  Flynn lost the 1897 election, and the Conservatives never held power in Quebec again.

They are known first from the surviving works of ancient authors such as Julius Caesar and Tacitus. They appear to have moved position several times before disappearing from the historical record.
While the Usipetes were referred to by the Romans as Germanic rather than Gauls, their recorded names are most reasonably explained as Celtic: Usipetes translates as "good riders", and Caesar and others report them to have strong cavalry.-ipetes (*epetes) is a cognate of the Latin equites.

George Edmund Badger (April 17, 1795[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]May 11, 1866) was a Whig U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina.
Badger was born on April 17, 1795 in New Bern, North Carolina. Following a partial college education at Yale University, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1814. Badger practiced law in North Carolina, was active in state politics, and served as a state superior court judge. A supporter of Andrew Jackson from the 1820s, he separated with him in the mid-1830s, became a leader of the Whig party and helped carry the Whigs to victory in the 1840 Presidential election.
Upon taking office, President William Henry Harrison appointed Badger as his Secretary of the Navy, and he continued in that post when John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency upon Harrison's death. Badger's brief term as Secretary was marked by efforts to strengthen the Navy in the face of tension with Great Britain, the establishment of the Home Squadron and continued interest in steamships.
Badger resigned in September 1841, during a general cabinet shakeup. He was elected to the Senate in 1846 to fill the unexpired term of William Henry Haywood, Jr. and remained a Senator until 1855. He was nominated by President Millard Fillmore as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in 1853, but was not confirmed by the Senate. John Archibald Campbell instead got the position. He was a Unionist during the secession crisis but thereafter supported the Confederate war effort. Badger died in Raleigh, North Carolina on May 11, 1866.
Two Navy ships have been named in honor of Senator Badger: USS George E. Badger (DD-196), and USS Badger (FF-1071).  A Liberty ship, the SS George E. Badger, also was named in his honor. Badger was a cousin of naval officers Oscar C. Badger, Charles J. Badger and Oscar C. Badger II.

Asa Biggs (February 4, 1811[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]March 6, 1878) was a North Carolina politician who held a number of positions. He was a U.S. Representative, a U.S. Senator, and federal judge.
Biggs was born in Williamston, Martin County, North Carolina. He read law, was admitted to the bar in 1831, and commenced practice in Williamston. He was a member of the North Carolina state constitutional convention in 1835, the state house of commons from 1840 to 1842, and the state senate from 1844 to 1845.
Biggs was elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-ninth Congress and served from March 4, 1845 to March 4, 1847, but was unsuccessful in his bid for re-election in 1846. In 1851 he became a member of the commission to codify the North Carolina state laws. His role in codifying the laws of North Carolina is the most distinctive aspect of his historical importance. 
He was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate in 1855 and served from March 4, 1855 until May 5, 1858, when he resigned to accept an appointment to the United States District Court for the District of North Carolina by President James Buchanan to a seat vacated by Henry Potter. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 3, 1858, and received his commission the same day.
He served as judge of that district court until April 23, 1861, as a member of the secession convention of North Carolina in 1861, and as a Confederate judge from 1861 to 1865. He supported secession and believed the action to be legal according to the United States constitution.
Following his service as a judge, Biggs resumed the practice of law in Tarboro, Edgecombe County, North Carolina in 1865. 
In 1869 he moved to Norfolk, Virginia. He continued the practice of law in that community until his death on March 6, 1878. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery.

Furnifold McLendel Simmons (January 20, 1854[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]April 30, 1940) was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1887 to March 4, 1889 and U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between March 4, 1901 and March 4, 1931. He served as chairman of the powerful Committee on Finance from March 4, 1913 to March 4, 1919. He was an unsuccessful contender for the 1920 Democratic Party nomination for president.
As a leader of the state Democratic Party, Simmons led the 1898-1900 White Supremacy campaigns that effectively disfranchised black voters for a half-century. From his Senate seat, he then ran a powerful political machine, using A. D. Watts "to keep the machine oiled back home," in the words of one journalist.News & Observer: "What the obituary didn't say" by Rob Christensen
Senator Simmons refused to endorse Al Smith, the Democratic nominee for president in 1928.  This, together with the Great Depression, led to Simmons being defeated in the 1930 Democratic primary by Josiah W. Bailey, who was backed by Governor O. Max Gardner.

NBA Live is a series of basketball video games, published by EA Sports. It is the successor to EA's previous NBA Playoffs and NBA Showdown series. Its main competitor is the NBA 2K series. After the release of NBA Live 10, EA attempted to retool the series under a new name with NBA Elite 11. However, the game was met with bad publicity and development problems before release and was cancelled (though a playable demo was released for download). In November 2010, development of the franchise was moved from EA Canada studio to Florida-based Tiburon studio.

Disc dog (commonly called Frisbee dog) is a dog sport.  In disc dog competitions, dogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching.  The sport celebrates the bond between handler and dog, by allowing them to work together.  The term "disc" is preferred because "Frisbee" is a trademark (held by Wham-O) for a brand of flying disc.

Josiah William Bailey (September 14, 1873 – December 15, 1946) was a Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1931 and 1946.  Born in Warrenton, NC, he grew up in Raleigh and graduated from Wake Forest College (now Wake Forest University).  Before turning to a career in law, Bailey was editor of the Biblical Recorder, a newspaper for North Carolina Baptists.
Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1930 by defeating longtime Democratic Senator Furnifold McLendel Simmons, Bailey earned a reputation as a conservative while in office.  In 1937, he co-authored the bi-partisan Conservative Manifesto, a document criticizing President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and proposing more conservative alternatives.  Among other things, the Manifesto called for lower taxes and less spending.(http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/12/entry)  During his time in office, he served as chairman of two different committees: the Committee on Claims and later the Committee on Commerce.
Bailey died in office in 1946.
Well known for his quotes, two of the most famous of which are most likely:
 "They who forgive most, shall be most forgiven." 
 "Since we humans have the better brain, isn't it our responsibility to protect our fellow creatures from, oddly enough, ourselves?".

[[Triple Play series]]

CATEGORIES: Major League Baseball video games, EA Sports games, Video game franchises

Triple Play was a series of computer and video games based on Major League Baseball, published by EA Sports until their replacement by the MVP Baseball in 2003.
Most video game reviewers, including GameSpot, stated that other simulations (for example, Sega's version) were superior to Triple Play, and its sales were lower; therefore, EA Sports decided to move in a new direction, beginning with the name change to MVP Baseball. Here are the games in the series with the baseball athletes on the cover:
All of the games contained the rosters and schedules of the beginning of the season of the year before the one described in the name except for Triple Play 2002. For example, Triple Play 2001 contained the rosters and schedules of the 2000 season, and Triple Play Baseball (without a year) contained the rosters and schedules for 2001. This is a result of the tradition of listing the year the series ends in, basketball, football and hockey ending in a different year from when they started. Baseball is the only exception, as it begins in March and ends in October of the same year.
The games were produced primarily for the PlayStation console, but also saw release on the PC and the Game Boy Color.

[[Filter fluorometer]]

CATEGORIES: Measuring instruments

A filter fluorometer is a type of fluorometer that may be employed in fluorescence spectroscopy. 
In the fluorometer, a light source emits light of an excitation wavelength that is relevant to the compound to be measured. Filter fluorometers produce specific excitation and emission wavelengths by using optical filters. The filter blocks other wavelengths but transmits wavelengths relevant to the compound. The light passes through the sample to be measured, and a certain wavelength is absorbed while a longer wavelength is emitted. The emitted light is measured by a detector. By changing the optical filter, different substances can be measured.

The Blackburn B-25 Roc was a British Second World War-era Fleet Air Arm fighter aircraft designed by Blackburn Aircraft Ltd. It took its name from the mythical bird of the tales of the Arabian Nights, the Roc. Derived from Blackburn's Skua and developed in parallel, the Roc differed in its adoption of a turret for its armament. Operationally, the Roc came to be viewed as inferior to existing aircraft, such as the Skua, and the type only had a brief frontline service.

[[Electron excitation]]

CATEGORIES: Electron

Electron excitation is the transfer of a bound electron to a more energetic, but still bound state. This can be done by photoexcitation (PE), where the electron absorbs a photon and gains all its energy or by electrical excitation (EE), where the electron receives energy from another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, thermal excitation is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to transfer electrons to a higher energy band. When an excited electron falls back to a state of lower energy, it undergoes electron relaxation. This is accompanied by the emission of a photon (radiative relaxation) or by a transfer of energy to another particle.

Agalmatophilia (from the Greek agalma 'statue', and -philia φιλία = love) is a paraphilia involving sexual attraction to a statue, doll, mannequin or other similar figurative object. The attraction may include a desire for actual sexual contact with the object, a fantasy of having sexual (or non-sexual) encounters with an animate or inanimate instance of the preferred object, the act of watching encounters between such objects, or sexual pleasure gained from thoughts of being transformed or transforming another into the preferred object. Agalmatophilia may also encompass Pygmalionism (from the myth of Pygmalion), which denotes love for an object of one's own creation.Ellis, 1927.

Juraj Jánošík (first name also Juro or  Jurko, [tpl]IPA-cs|ˈjuraj ˈjaːnɔʃiːk|sl[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-pl|Jerzy Janosik[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-pol|ˈjɛʐɨ jaˈnɔɕik|pl[/tpl], [tpl]lang-hu|Jánosik György [/tpl]; baptised January 25, 1688, died March 17, 1713) was a famous Slovak highwayman. Jánošík has been the main character of many Slovak and Polish legends, novels, poems and films. He is a semi-legendary character in Central Europe.
According to the legend, he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor, a deed often attributed to the famous Robin Hood. The legend was also known in neighboring Silesia, the Margraviate of Moravia and later spread to the Kingdom of Bohemia. The actual robber had little to do with the modern legend, whose content partly reflects the ubiquitous folk myths of a hero taking from the rich and giving to the poor. However, the legend was also shaped in important ways by the activists and writers in the 19th century when Jánošík became the key highwayman character in stories that spread in the north counties of the Kingdom of Hungary (much in present Slovakia) and among the local Gorals and Polish tourists in the Podhale region north of the Tatras (Tatra). The image of Jánošík as a symbol of resistance to oppression was reinforced when poems about him became part of the Slovak and Czech middle and high school literature curriculum, and then again with the numerous films that propagated his modern legend in the 20th century. During the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising, one of the partisan groups bore his name.

[[Financial privacy]]

CATEGORIES: Privacy, Banking, Business ethics, Personal finance

Financial Privacy is a blanket term for a multitude of privacy issues:
Debates on the first sense of the phrase have many different points of view, from crypto anarchists who want to create a completely decentralized and anonymous banking system, to others who support enhancing the power of the government to find financial information in order to fight terrorism.
However, the majority of the debate in the United States involves the second sense of the phrase. The same anger against telemarketers which led to the United States National Do Not Call Registry also was focused on what some alleged to be the source of many of the telemarketers leads: financial institutions selling things like balances and transaction information to telemarketers. Financial services companies, those that offer both banking, insurance, and investment products however say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was brought on by smaller financial institutions who simply focused on one type of product or business. The reason for this is that combining all those products with one company creates a Wal Mart style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they never had sold information to non financial services companies. Some critics of financial institutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.

Augustus Summerfield Merrimon (September 15, 1830[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]November 14, 1892) was a Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1873 and 1879.
An attorney from Buncombe County, North Carolina, Merrimon served in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1860 to 1861.  He briefly served in the Confederate Army when the American Civil War broke out, but resigned to become solicitor (prosecutor) for North Carolina's eighth judicial district.  After the war, Merrimon served as a state superior court judge, then returned to the practice of law, and was an unsuccessful Democratic (at the time, officially called the Conservative Party) candidate for Governor of North Carolina in 1872. With 49.5 percent of the vote, Merrimon lost an extremely close race to incumbent Tod R. Caldwell. http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=117333
Merrimon was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1872. He and former Gov. Zebulon B. Vance had already become intense political enemies, though both were affiliated with the Conservative Party. After Vance won the endorsement of the Conservative Party in the legislature, the minority Republicans in the legislature voted with Merrimon's supporters to elect him to the Senate (New York Times, October 14, 1878).
During his term in the Senate, Merrimon gained a reputation as "one of the bitterest partisan Democrats in Congress" (New York Times, October 14, 1878). He was appointed to the 'South Carolina Committee,' a Congressional commission assigned to conduct hearings into voter intimidation and fraud during the 1876 elections in South Carolina—the elections which brought an end to Reconstruction and restored white supremacists to power. The only Democrat on the Committee, Merrimon badgered black and white Republican witnesses band attempted to downplay and excuse white atrocities. A full transcript of the testimony can be found in the 3 bound volumes (South Carolina in 1876) published by the 42nd Congress. After Vance was elected Governor in 1876, he began recruiting candidates to defeat Merrimon supporters in legislative races to lay the groundwork to take Merrimon's seat in the Senate. In the legislative election of 1878, the state Democrats ran two slates in many districts: one pledged to Merrimon and one pledged to Vance. The result was mixed; the Republicans gained 13 seats in the legislature, and the majority Democrats were still divided in their loyalties (Merrimon 40 to Vance 60 with 70 Republicans). The Republican legislators voted for Vance in the election in early 1879, giving him the majority.
After being defeated for re-election, Merrimon served as an Associate Justice (1883–1889) and then Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court (1889 until his death in 1892).   Merrimon Avenue in Asheville is named in his memory.

The Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, commonly called the Whirlpool Bridge, and until 1937, known as the Lower Steel Arch Bridge, is a spandrel braced, riveted, two-hinged arch bridge. It crosses the international border between Canada and the United States, connecting the commercial downtown districts of Niagara Falls, Ontario and Niagara Falls, New York. This bridge is located approximately [tpl]convert|1.5|km|mi|1[/tpl] north of the Rainbow Bridge and about [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|1[/tpl] from the Falls. This bridge was acquired by the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission in January 1959.
The bridge was designed by Leffert L. Buck and constructed between April 9, 1896, and August 27, 1897. It was constructed around the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge so as not to interrupt daily traffic.
The bridge has two decks. The upper deck carries the railway traffic while the lower deck is a roadway reserved for passenger vehicles only; commercial vehicles and pedestrians are prohibited. The Whirlpool Bridge is reserved for NEXUS members, a joint program implemented by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP). There is one lane of traffic to the United States and one lane to Canada. The American side connects to New York State Route 104 and New York State Route 182, while the Canadian side connects to the historic terminus of King's Highways 3A, 20 and 8, now known as River Road and Bridge Street.left|thumb|The Maple Leaf crosses the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge over the Niagara River (1983).

Jeter Connelly Pritchard (July 12, 1857[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]April 10, 1921) was a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of North Carolina between 1895 and 1903. He was the only Republican to represent a southern state in the United States Senate during that time.
Pritchard was born in Jonesborough, Tennessee. A newspaper editor/publisher and later a lawyer by trade, he was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives from Madison County in 1884, 1886, and 1890, and was a candidate for lieutenant governor in 1888. He read law to enter the bar in 1889, and established his legal practice in Marshall, North Carolina. He unsuccessfully sought appointment to the U.S. Senate in 1891, and election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1892.
Following the victory of the Republican-Populist alliance (or "fusion") in the 1894 legislative elections, the North Carolina General Assembly elected Pritchard to the Senate, to complete the rest of the term of the late Sen. Zebulon Vance.OurCampaigns.com: US Senate special election of Jan. 23, 1895 He was re-elected by the legislature in 1897 to a full term.OurCampaigns.com: US Senate election of Jan. 20, 1897 The legislature (by now back in Democratic hands) chose not to re-elect him to the Senate in 1903.
On November 10, 1903, Pritchard was nominated by President Theodore Roosevelt to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated by Harry M. Clabaugh. Pritchard was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 16, 1903, and received his commission the same day.

[[Excited state]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics

Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being excited to an excited state.
In quantum mechanics an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum).  
The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit Negative temperature).
The lifetime of a system in an excited state is usually short: spontaneous or induced emission of a quantum of energy (such as a photon or a phonon) usually occurs shortly after the system is promoted to the excited state, returning the system to a state with lower energy (a less excited state or the ground state).  This return to a lower energy level is often loosely described as decay and is the inverse of excitation.
Long-lived excited states are often called metastable. Long-lived nuclear isomers and singlet oxygen are two examples of this.

They were ranked as number one on the year-end list for "Top Artists" on the Folk Music Radio Airplay Chart for 2001 and 2002, and their popularity has endured in the years following Carter's death.Annual Folk Airplay Summaries, Compiled by Richard Gillmann of KBCS from FolkDJ-L playlists.  Joan Baez who went on tour with the duo in 2002 spoke of Carter's songs in the same terms that she once used to promote a young Bob Dylan:
 "There is a special gift for writing songs that are available to other people, and Dave's songs are very available to me.  It's a kind of genius, you know, and Dylan has the biggest case of it.  But I hear it in Dave's songs, too. 
Carter's songs were often noted for their poetic imagery, spirituality and storytelling while retaining connection to the country music of his southern American upbringing.  Carter's memory has been kept alive by his many admirers, most notably his former partner.  Tracy Grammer has continued to introduce previously unrecorded songs and recordings that the duo were working on prior to Carter's death.

Robert Rice Reynolds (June 18, 1884 – February 13, 1963) was a Democratic U.S. senator from North Carolina between 1932 and 1945. Almost from the outset of his Senate career, "Our Bob," as he was known among supporters back home, acquired distinction as a passionate isolationist and increasingly as an apologist for Nazi aggression in Europe. Even after America's entry into World War II, according to a contemporary study of subversive elements in America, he "publicly endorsed the propaganda efforts of Gerald L. K. Smith," whose scurilous publication The Cross and the Flag "violently assailed the United States war effort and America's allies."Michael Sayers and Albert E. Kahn, Sabotage, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1942, p. 249. Reynolds and Smith, one of the nation's most virulent Fascists, likewise collaborated on The Defender, an anti-Semitic newspaper partly owned by Reynolds that portrayed Jews as the anti-Christ.Charles Higham, American Swastika, Doubleday & Co., Garden City, N.Y., 1985, p. 52. Reynolds on occasion turned over his Senate office facilities to subversive propagandists and allowed them to use his franking privilege to mail their literature postage-free.Sayers and Kahn, pp. 193, 227.
Originally from the town of Asheville, Reynolds practiced law there and was elected to serve as solicitor (prosecuting attorney) for the area (1910–1914).  He ran for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 1924, losing to J. Elmer Long in the Democratic primary. Reynolds first ran for the United States Senate in 1926, but was not successful. He ran again in 1932 and defeated interim Senator Cameron Morrison in the Democratic primary runoff by nearly two to one after running a particularly nasty, populist campaign, which accused Morrison of being a Communist sympathizer. During one campaign speech, he proclaimed, "Cam likes fish eggs, and Red Russian fish eggs at that. Don't you want a Senator who likes North Carolina hen eggs?"[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
President Franklin Roosevelt recruited Franklin W. Hancock, Jr. to oppose Reynolds in the 1938 Democratic primary, but Reynolds won handily.
In 1941, Reynolds became chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs.
In 1943 a confidential report by Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office stated of Reynolds:
[tpl]quote|is exceptional among Southerners, in that he is a bitter Isolationist of a disreputable kind. His Anglophobia is proverbial and his journal The Vindicator is a low-grade Fascist sheet. He is distrusted by the majority of his colleagues and his assumption of the chairmanship of the Military Affairs Committtee (by seniority) was universally regarded as disastrous outside his own circle of chauvinist demagogues. His State produces cotton and tobacco and he, therefore, votes for reciprocal trade pacts.The scholar who in 1973 edited and analyzed Berlin's report described his allegations regarding Reynolds' sympathy to fascism as "both intemperate and gratuitous".

By 1944, the Democratic Party had had enough of Reynolds and chose former governor Clyde R. Hoey to seek Reynolds's seat in the primary. As a result, Reynolds did not seek reelection. Hoey won the primary and went on to win the general election in a landslide victory over a Republican opponent.  Reynolds did seek to return to the Senate in 1950, but was hopelessly discredited by this time and won only 10% in the Democratic primary, behind Frank Porter Graham and Willis Smith.

Cadwallon ap Cadfan (died 634A difference in the interpretation of Bede's dates has led to the question of whether Cadwallon was killed in 634 or the year earlier, 633. Cadwallon died in the year after the Battle of Hatfield Chase, which Bede reports as occurring in October 633; but if Bede's years are believed to have actually started in September, as some historians have argued, then Hatfield Chase would have occurred in 632, and therefore Cadwallon would have died in 633. Other historians have argued against this view of Bede's chronology, however, favoring the dates as he gives them.) was the King of Gwynedd from around 625 until his death in battle. The son and successor of Cadfan ap Iago, he is best remembered as the King of the Britons who invaded and conquered Northumbria, defeating and killing its king, Edwin, prior to his own death in battle against Oswald of Bernicia. His conquest of Northumbria, which he held for a year or two after Edwin died, made him the last Briton to hold substantial territory in eastern Britain until the rise of the Tudor dynasty.Koch, p. 315. He was thereafter remembered as a national hero by the Britons and as a tyrant by the Anglo-Saxons of Northumbria.

The Conservative Order is a term applied to European political history after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. From 1815 to 1830 a conscious program by conservative statesmen, including Metternich and Castlereagh, was put in place to contain revolution and revolutionary forces by restoring old orders, particularly previous ruling  aristocracies. In South America, on the other hand and in light of the Monroe Doctrine, this was a time in which the Spanish and Portuguese colonies gained independence.
Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria renewed their commitment to prevent any restoration of Bonapartist power and agreed to meet regularly in conferences to discuss their common interests. This period contains the time of the Holy Alliance, which was a military agreement. The Concert of Europe was the political framework that grew out of the Quadruple Alliance, in November 1815.

The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs are an Australian professional rugby league football club based in Belmore, a suburb in the Canterbury-Bankstown region of Sydney.  They compete in the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership, as well as New South Wales Rugby League junior competitions. The club was admitted to the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership, predecessor of the current NRL competition, in 1935. They won their first premiership in their 4th year of competition with another soon after, and later went through a very strong period in the 1980s, winning four premierships in that decade. Known briefly in the 1990s as the Sydney Bulldogs, as a result of the Super League war the club competed in that competition in 1997 before changing their name to the geographically indistinct Bulldogs and continuing to play every season of the re-unified NRL, winning their most recent premiership in 2004. In 2012 the Bulldogs won the minor premiership, being the best club in the competition in the regular season, but lost to the Melbourne Storm 14-4 in the Grand Final.

[[Gigas (fantasy games)]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional species and races

Gigas is a popular term for races of giants in fantasy games. Gigas is a Greek word meaning "giant", originally used to describe the race of Gigantes in Greek mythology and is used in the scientific name, as the specific epithet, of hundreds species of animals and dozens of plant species to denote their size. 
The name has been used in Square games.  It was first used in this sense in the game Final Fantasy I, and was subsequently used in many other Square games, such as Secret of Mana, often appearing as sub-bosses. In Final Fantasy VI the character Umaro is said to have the strength of a gigas, and in Final Fantasy VII the character Vincent Valentine has a Limit Break in which he transforms into a monster called the 'Death Gigas'. Gigas appear in Final Fantasy XI as a race of Beastmen who live in Northern regions of Vana'diel, the fictional world depicted in the game. In Kingdom Hearts Goofy has an attack called Gigas Fist. Most recently, one of the Final Fantasy XII Espers, magic beasts summoned by the player, is named "Belias, the Gigas."  According to the in-game bestiary, Belias is classified as a fusion of man and beast and considered a mistake by the gods. In addition, a fiend that guards the Stilshrine of Miriam area is known as the Blood Gigas. According to the in-game bestiary, the Blood Gigas is "a cruel and headless giant, born from the spilled blood of a demon."
After its usage in Square games, the Gigas has appeared in other video game series, such as Skies of Arcadia. The final colossus in Sony's Shadow of the Colossus is known as Grand Gigas Malus. The Beast Spirit of Earth in Digimon Frontier is called Gigasmon. The alternate spelling Giygas was used as the name of the final boss of EarthBound. In the second series Yu-Gi-Oh! anime the character Dartz uses a monster known as Orichalcos Gigas, which is another giant.  In the Pokémon series, the name of the 486th Pokémon is Regigigas, meaning royal giant.
The term has also been used to describe gigantic war constructs in the comic book Gold Digger by Fred Perry, and was the name of a simian monster from the Ultraman television series.

The Allegheny Mountain Range [tpl]IPAc-en|æ|l|ɨ|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|n|i[/tpl] — also spelled Alleghany, Allegany and, informally, the Alleghenies — is part of the vast Appalachian Mountain Range of the eastern United States and Canada where it posed a significant barrier to land travel in less technologically advanced historical eras.  It is a barrier range that has a northeast-southwest orientation and runs for about 400 miles (640 km) from north-central Pennsylvania, through western Maryland and eastern West Virginia, to southwestern Virginia.
The Alleghenies comprise the rugged western-central portion of the Appalachians. They rise to approximately 4,862 feet (1,483 m) in northeastern West Virginia. In the east, they are dominated by a high, steep escarpment known as the Allegheny Front. In the west, they grade down into the closely associated Allegheny Plateau which extends into Ohio and Kentucky. The principal settlements of the Alleghenies are Johnstown, Pennsylvania and Cumberland, Maryland.

[[Internal conversion]]

CATEGORIES: Radioactivity, Nuclear physics

Internal conversion is a radioactive decay process where an excited nucleus interacts electromagnetically with an electron in one of the lower atomic orbitals, causing the electron to be emitted (ejected) from the atom.[tpl]cite book|last=Loveland|first=Walter D.|title=Modern Nuclear Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471115320|pages=232|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZAHJkrJlwbYC&pg=PA233&dq=internal+conversion&hl=en&sa=X&ei=anDHUJ_bGu7s0gXS3YGQDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=internal%20conversion&f=false[/tpl]  Thus, in an internal conversion process, a high-energy electron is emitted from the radioactive atom, but not from a nucleon in the nucleus. Instead, the electron is ejected as a result of an interaction between the entire nucleus and an outside electron that interacts with it. For this reason, the high-speed electrons from internal conversion are not beta particles, since the latter come from beta decay, where they are newly created in the process. Since no beta decay takes place during internal conversion, the element atomic number does not change, and thus (as is the case with gamma decay) no transmutation of one element to another is seen. However, since an electron is lost, an otherwise neutral atom becomes ionized. Also, no neutrino is emitted during internal conversion.
Internally converted electrons do not have the characteristic energetically spread spectrum of beta particles, which results from varying amounts of decay energy being carried off by the neutrino (or antineutrino) in beta decay. Internally converted electrons, which carry a fixed fraction of the characteristic decay energy, have a well-specified discrete energy. The energy spectrum of a beta particle is thus a broad hump, extending to a maximum decay energy value, while the spectrum of internally converted electrons has a sharp peak.

[[Video camera tube]]

CATEGORIES: History of television, Television technology, Vacuum tubes

In older video cameras, before the mid to late 1980s, a video camera tube or pickup tube was used instead of a charge-coupled device (CCD) for converting an optical image into an electrical signal. Several types were in use from the 1930s to the 1980s. The most commercially successful of these tubes were various types of cathode ray tubes or "CRTs".
Any vacuum tube which operates using a focused beam of electrons ("cathode rays") is known as a cathode ray tube. However, in the popular lexicon "CRT" usually refers to the "picture tube" in a television or computer monitor. The proper term for this type of display tube is kinescope, only one of many types of cathode ray tubes. Others include the tubes used in oscilloscopes, radar displays, and the camera pickup tubes described in this article."Cathode-ray tube", McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science & Technology, Third Ed., Sybil P. Parker, ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1992, pp. 332-333. (The word "kinescope" has also become the popular name for a film recording made by focusing a motion picture camera onto the face of a kinescope cathode ray tube, a common practice before the advent of video tape recording.Abramson, Albert, The History of Television, 1942 to 2000, McFarland, 2003, p. 26. ISBN 0-7864-1220-8.)
Video camera tubes typically had a certain maximum brightness tolerance. If that limit were exceeded, such as by pointing the camera at the sun, sun-reflecting shiny surfaces, like chrome car bumpers, or extremely bright point light sources, the tube detecting surface would instantly "burn out" and be rendered insensitive on part or all of the screen. A slight burn might fade away over a matter of weeks, but for a severe burn the only remedy was replacing the video tube.[tpl]cite book |last=Bensinger |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Bensinger |year=1981 |title=The Home Video Handbook  |edition=2nd |publisher=Video-Info Publications |location=Santa Barbara, California. |isbn=0-931294-02-9 |pages= 148–150[/tpl]

Berta Maria Júlia Lutz (August 2, 1894, São Paulo – September 16, 1976, Rio de Janeiro) was a zoologist, and scientist who became a leading figure of the feminist movement in Brazil.
She was born in São Paulo. Her father, Adolfo Lutz (1855–1940), was a famous physician and epidemiologist of Swiss origin, and her mother, Amy Fowler, was a British nurse. Berta Lutz studied natural sciences, biology and zoology at the University of Paris - Sorbonne. After returning to Brazil, she dedicated herself to the study of amphibians, especially poison dart frogs and frogs of the family Hylidae.Lutz, Bertha. Brazilian Species of "Hyla". 1973. University of Texas Press. Austin. 260 pp. ISBN 978-0292707047.  The Lutz's Rapids Frog (Paratelmatobius lutzii, Lutz and Carvalho, 1958), was described by her. In 1919, she was hired by the Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro, a fact which achieved great repercussion in the country, because the access to public offices was barred to women at that time. She later became a naturalist at the Section of Botany at the same institution.
In 1918, Berta returned to Brazil and spoke out for a feminist movement to begin. After seeing the advancements made by European and American women towards the feminist movements, she could see that Brazilian women could also help out with the movement by lending whatever aid they could to the organization. In 1922, Berta attended the Pan American Conference of Women, and was advised by Paulina Luisi and Carrie Chapman Catt. Following the conference, Berta drew up the constitution for a group named the Federação Brasileira pelo Progresso Feminino (FPBF) Brazilian Federation for the Advancement of Women.
In 1934, the women of Brazil earned the right to vote due to Lutz and her organization.
As a politician, Berta Lutz was elected a deputy federal representative in 1934, after failing two successive ballots. Her main political platform was changing worker's legislation in relation to women's right to work, child labor, gender equality in wages and rights, the lawful right to maternity leave. She lost her mandate when Getúlio Vargas closed down both legislative chambers in 1937.
Lutz was one of four women who signed the United Nations Charter at San Francisco on 25 Oct. 1945 UN Charter; UN Chronicle 2002.  She was also Brazil's representative to sign the important treaty on Diplomatic Asylum 1954.UN Treaty Series

Jerome Lawrence (born Jerome Lawrence Schwartz; July 14, 1915 – February 29, 2004) was an American playwright and author. After graduating from Ohio State University in 1937 and the University of California, Los Angeles in 1939, Lawrence partnered with Robert Edwin Lee to help create Armed Forces Radio. The two built a partnership over their lifetimes, and continued to collaborate on screenplays and musicals until Lee's death in 1994. 
Lawrence and Lee won positive acclaim for the 1955 screenplay Inherit the Wind, based on the Scopes Trial. Lawrence describes the couple's plays as "sharing the theme of the dignity of every individual mind, and that mind's life-long battle against limitation and censorship". The two deliberately avoided Broadway later in their careers and formed the American Playwrights Theater in 1963 to help promote their plays. After Lee's death, Lawrence continued to write plays in his Malibu, California home. He died in Malibu on February 29, 2004, from complications of a stroke.

[[Cuban cuisine]]

CATEGORIES: Cuban cuisine, Caribbean cuisine, Latin American cuisine, Cuban culture

Cuban cuisine is a fusion of Native American Taino food, Spanish, African, and Caribbean cuisines. Some Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish and African cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. This results in a unique, interesting and flavorful blend of the several different cultural influences, with strong similarities with the cuisine of the neighboring Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. A small but noteworthy Chinese influence can also be accounted for, mainly in the Havana area. During colonial times, Cuba was an important port for trade, and many Spaniards who lived there brought their culinary traditions along with them.Rodriguez, H. "Cuban Food Profile: Cuban Food History"
As a result of the colonization of Cuba by Spain, one of the main influences on the cuisine is from Spain. Along with Spain, other culinary influences include Africa, from the Africans that were brought to Cuba as slaves, and Dutch, from the French colonists that came to Cuba from Haiti. Another important factor is that Cuba itself is an island, making seafood something that greatly influences Cuban cuisine. Another contributing factor to Cuban cuisine is the fact that Cuba is in a tropical climate. The tropical climate produces fruits and root vegetables that are used in Cuban dishes and meals.Murray, J. "Cuban Cuisine, Cuba History and Their Food"
A typical meal would consist of rice and beans, cooked together or apart. When cooked together the recipe is called either "Congri" or "Moros" or "Moros y Cristianos" (black beans and rice). If cooked separately it is called "Arroz con/y Frijoles" (rice with/and beans)."Frijoles Negros" A main course (mainly pork or beef) like "Ropa Vieja", some sort of [tpl]lang|es|vianda[/tpl] (not to be confused with the French viande which stands for "meat", this term encompasses several types of tubers, such as yuca, malanga, and potato all served either hervidas (boiled) or fritas (fried), as well as plantains, unripe bananas and even corn), a salad (usually simply composed of tomato, lettuce and avocado, though cucumber, carrots, cabbage, fermented green beans and radish are not uncommon). Curiously, typical criollo meals largely ignore fruit, except ripe plantains, which are usually consumed together with the rice and beans. Tropical fruit could be served, however, depending on each family's preferences. Usually, all dishes are brought together to the table at once, except maybe for desserts which typically consists of guava candied in syrup with anise and cinnamon served with a tangy and pungent white Sheep milk cheese.
Rice and beans are a culinary element found throughout Cuba, although it varies by region. In the eastern part of the island, "arroz congri oriental" is the predominant rice and bean dish. White rice and red kidney beans are cooked together with a sofrito and then baked in the oven. The same procedure is used for the above mentioned Congri (also known by the terms Arroz Moro and Moros y Cristianos – literally "Moors and Christians") which instead uses black beans. Although the process of preparing the black bean soup contains basics (onion, garlic, bay leaf, salt) each region has their tradition of preparing it.
Meat, when available on ration book is usually served in light sauces. The most popular sauce, used to accompany not only roasted pork, but also the viandas, is Mojo or Mojito (not to be confused with the Mojito cocktail), made with oil, garlic, onion, spices such as oregano and bitter orange or lime juice. The origin of Cuban mojo comes from the mojo sauces of the Canary Islands. Cuban mojo is made with different ingredients, but the same idea and technique is used from the Canary Islands. Of course with so many Canary Islander immigrants in Cuba, the Canary Islander influence was strong. Ropa vieja is shredded beef dish (usually flank) simmered in tomato-based criollo sauce until it falls apart. Ropa Vieja is the Spanish name meaning "old clothes", in which the dish gets its name from the shredded meat resembling "old clothes". Ropa vieja is also from the Canary Islands, as is many of the origins of Cuban food. Boliche is a beef roast, stuffed with chorizo sausage and hard boiled eggs.
Equally popular are tamales, although not exactly similar to its Mexican counterpart. Made with fresh ground corn, Sofrito (tomato,onion,garlic Etc.) and pieces of pork meat, tamales are wrapped in corn leaves and tied, boiled in salted water and served in a number of different ways. Tamales en cazuela is almost the same recipe, although it does not require the lengthy process of packing the tamales in the corn leaves before cooking, but rather is directly cooked in the pot. Tamales as well as black bean soup, are among the few indigenous foods that have remained part of the modern Cuban cuisine.
Stews and soups are common. These are usually consumed along with white rice or gofio (a type of corn flour, also from the Canary Islands), or eaten alone. Corn stew, corn soup (guiso), caldosa (a soup made with a variety of tubers and meats), are popular dishes as well. Also common when available are the popular white bean Spanish stews, such as Caldo gallego (Galician stew), Fabada Asturiana (Asturian Stew) and Cocido de Garbanzos (chickpea stew).
Cuban cuisine uses citrus (i.e. sour orange, lime, lemon), tomato, vinegar, onion, garlic, peppers, white wine or beer (depending on region and dish), raisins and olives/capers to flavor almost every savory dish. This combination of flavor often results in complex flavors with sweet, salty and acidic components. Cuban desserts are known for their sweetness and many desserts use citrus peel, cinnamon and/or anise seed to add distinct flavor. Tropical fruits are often cooked in a sugar syrup with cinnamon and citrus peel and served on white cheese for contrasting flavor or baked in flaky pastries.
Cuban cuisine has developed through the influences of the Cuban exile community in Miami and many traditional Cuban dishes have been readdressed by chefs influenced by nouvelle cuisine and American tastes.

Robert Burren Morgan (born October 5, 1925) was a Democratic U.S. Senator from the state of North Carolina from 1975 until 1981. Born in Lillington, N.C., Morgan attended
Lillington public schools and later East Carolina College and Wake Forest University School of Law.
Morgan's political career began early when political leaders in his home county of Harnett, including highly respected Democratic Party stalwart Veneble Baggett, visited him at the Wake Forest Law School and urged him to run for Clerk of Court.  Morgan did so and was elected. After building a reputation in that office, he went into the private practice of law. His skill as a trial lawyer caused his practice to grow, and he soon established a reputation that extended across the state.  Personal injury, real property and antitrust law were among his specialties.
He next ran for the North Carolina State Senate and won.  He rose to the Senate's highest office, President Pro Tempore, and chaired key committees.  He mastered the legislative process, and the experience he obtained in the State Senate served him well when he was later sent to the United States Senate by the voters of North Carolina.
In 1968, Morgan challenged long-time incumbent Attorney General Wade Bruton in the Democratic Party primary, defeated him, and then won the General Election.  He served one four-year term and then was re-elected.  He served two years of that term and then resigned to run for the U.S. Senate.
Early in his political career, Morgan was considered a conservative supporter of segregation because of his allegiance to his former Wake Forest law professor, conservative politician I. Beverly Lake, Sr., who ran an unsuccessful pro-segregation campaign for governor in 1960 against the progressive supporter of civil rights, Terry Sanford.http://books.google.com/books?id=WXj4nqPtcF8C&pg=PA162-IA3&lpg=PA162-IA3&dq=robert+morgan+campaign+manager+i+beverly+lake&source=bl&ots=wzt_GGEy1L&sig=utHK9wthryI0f2Os8RX790NclFI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9EmrUYTNKZCw8QTjlIHgCQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=robert%20morgan%20campaign%20manager%20i%20beverly%20lake&f=false
But later, as an influential state senator, as North Carolina attorney general from 1969 to 1974, and as the successful candidate to succeed Democratic U.S. Senator Sam Ervin, Morgan was considered a moderate.
After winning the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 1974, Morgan resigned as attorney general.  He then won the General Election over Republican William Stevens, garnering 63% of the vote.2008 North Carolina Election Primer He was defeated for re-election in 1980 by Republican John P. East in an extremely close race.Our Campaigns - NC US Senate Race - Nov 04, 1980 Morgan returned to the practice of law and also served as director of North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation under Attorney General Lacy Thornburg.
From 2000 to 2003, Morgan served as founding president of the North Carolina Center for Voter Education, a Raleigh, NC-based nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that seeks to increase civic engagement in North Carolina. Morgan is president emeritus of that organization.NC Center for Voter Education HistoryNC Center for Voter Education Board and Staff

John Porter East (May 5, 1931 – June 29, 1986) was a Republican U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina from 1981 until his suicide in 1986.
A paraplegic since 1955, because of polio, East was a professor of political science at East Carolina University in Greenville and a protégé of conservative Senator Jesse Helms. East ran unsuccessfully for a vacancy in the United States House of Representatives in a special election in 1966, a race won by Walter B. Jones, Sr..
In 1980, with the benefit of Ronald Reagan's North Carolina influence, East narrowly defeated incumbent Democratic Senator Robert Burren Morgan, largely on the strength of political advertising about Morgan's involvement with the turnover of the Panama Canal to the government of Panama. In the Senate, he earned a reputation as a staunch social conservative, especially on the issue of abortion. Alongside Jesse Helms, East led opposition to the bill to create a federal holiday to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1983.[tpl]cite news|last=Romero|first=Frances|title=A Brief History Of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1872501,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=January 18, 2010[/tpl] In 1986, he announced that he would not seek re-election, and would instead return to his teaching position. That summer, East, suffering from hypothyroidism, killed himself (for reasons that are still unclear) at his North Carolina home.

[[Jim Broyhill]]
CATEGORIES: 1927 births, Living people, Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina, United States Senators from North Carolina, Appointed United States Senators, North Carolina Republicans, People from Caldwell County, North Carolina, Republican Party United States Senators

James Thomas "Jim" Broyhill (born August 19, 1927) is a Republican former U.S. Representative and Senator from the state of North Carolina. He represented much of the Foothills region of the state in the House from 1963 to 1986, and served in the Senate for four months in 1986.http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/brownlee-brubeck.html
He was born in Lenoir, North Carolina, the youngest son of North Carolina furniture magnate J. E. Broyhill. The senior Broyhill was a member of the Republican National Committee for 28 years. However, for most of that time the party was almost nonexistent in the former Confederacy, including North Carolina. After attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Jim Broyhill joined his father's company in 1945 and served in various capacities there until 1962. He was also active in several state industry associations, as well as a civic leader in Lenoir.
He made his first run for elected office in 1962 for North Carolina's 9th Congressional District.  Broyhill was the unexpected beneficiary of redistricting after the 1960 census, which cost North Carolina a congressional district. The Democratic-controlled General Assembly saw a chance to get rid of the then lone Republican in the congressional delegation, Charles Raper Jonas of the Charlotte area by drawing his district from under him. In the process, they shifted some strongly Republican areas into the 9th, a district where growing Republican influence had kept five-term Democrat Hugh Quincy Alexander from establishing a foothold. At the same time, they shifted some strongly Democratic areas of the 9th into the new 8th District designed to defeat Jonas. However, the plan backfired disastrously when Jonas handily defeated 8th District incumbent A. Paul Kitchin and Broyhill defeated Alexander by just under one percentage point.
Broyhill never faced another contest nearly that close again.  Due to his very conservative stances on nearly all issues and an emphasis on taking good care of his constituents (most of whom had never been represented by a Republican before), he became very popular in his district. He won reelection by 11 points in the midst of the gigantic Democratic landslide of 1964, in which Lyndon B. Johnson carried 87 of North Carolina's 100 counties. Broyhill won reelection 10 times thereafter, never receiving less than 54 percent of the vote and only winning by less than 10 points twice in what became the most Republican district in North Carolina. His district was renumbered the 10th in 1969.
On June 29, 1986, Senator John P. East, who was not seeking reelection, committed suicide.  Broyhill had already won the Republican nomination for the race to succeed East, and Governor Jim Martin appointed Broyhill to the seat for the remainder of the term. The plan was to give Broyhill an incumbency advantage over the Democratic nominee, former Governor Terry Sanford. However, Sanford narrowly defeated Broyhill in November and took office immediately.
Broyhill later served as Chairman of the North Carolina Economic Development Commission and then as the state's Secretary of Commerce under Martin.
Broyhill remains active in North Carolina Republican politics as an "elder statesman."  He was inducted into the North Carolina Republican Party Hall of Fame and the Lenoir, North Carolina Post Office was renamed in his honor. He now lives in Winston-Salem with his wife, Louise Broyhill. He has a daughter, Marilyn Beach, and two sons, Ed and Phillip. His daughter Marilyn and his son Ed also reside in Winston-Salem. He has six grandchildren: Elizabeth Broyhill, James Broyhill, Penn Broyhill, Laura Beach Dugan, Lindsay Beach and Ashley Beach. His son Ed was a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 5th District in 2004.

Dartmouth BASIC is the original version of the BASIC programming language.  It is so named because it was designed and implemented at Dartmouth College. The language was designed by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz as part of the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) and was one of the first programming languages intended to be used interactively.
Several versions were produced at Dartmouth over the years, all implemented as compile and go compilers, unlike many of the versions of the language implemented elsewhere, which were interpreters.  The first compiler was produced before the time-sharing system was ready.  Known as CardBASIC, it was intended for the standard card-reader based batch processing system.  Like all the following versions, it was implemented by a team of undergraduate programmers working under the direction of Kemeny and Kurtz.  The first interactive version was made available to general users in June 1964; the second in October, 1964; the third in 1966; the fourth in 1969; the fifth in 1970; the sixth in 1971; and the seventh in 1979.

Félix-Gabriel Marchand (January 9, 1832 – September 25, 1900) was a journalist, author, notary and politician in  Quebec, Canada. He was the 11th Premier of Quebec from May 24, 1897 to September 25, 1900.
Born in what is Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec today, he was the son of Lt.-Colonel Gabriel Marchand (1780–1852) J.P., and Mary MacNider, a woman of the Anglican faith, daughter of the pioneering John MacNider, 2nd Seigneur of Metis, Quebec. As a child, Marchand attended English schools and was taught in French at the age of 11. Fluently bilingual, Marchand became a journalist and writer. He became a notary and practised this profession for 45 years, but continued journalism and writing as well.
He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1867 Quebec provincial election for the district of Saint-Jean and retained his seat for 33 years until his death.  He was Leader of the Opposition from 1892 to 1897, and then won the 1897 election as leader of the Liberal Party. 
As premier, Marchand attempted to create a Ministry of Education in 1898. At the time, education was entirely in the hands of the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church in the province.  His legislation was passed by the Legislative Assembly (the lower chamber of Quebec's legislature), but was defeated in the Legislative Council (the upper house).  It was not until 1964 that a Ministry of Education was finally created in Quebec.
Félix-Gabriel Marchand was still in office when he died in 1900 in Quebec City. He is interred in the cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont in Sainte-Foy, Quebec.
He won the 1897 election and died in office in 1900.

[[Two-stage-to-orbit]]
CATEGORIES: Spacecraft propulsion, Space launch vehicles, Single-stage-to-orbit

A two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO or DSTO - Double/Dual-Stage-To-Orbit) launch vehicle is a spacecraft in which two distinct stages provide propulsion consecutively in order to achieve orbital velocity. It is intermediate between a three-stage-to-orbit launcher and a hypothetical single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launcher.
At liftoff the first stage is responsible for accelerating the vehicle.  At some point the second stage detaches from the first stage and continues to orbit under its own power.
An advantage of such a system over single-stage-to-orbit is that the entire mass of the spacecraft is not carried into orbit. This reduces the difficulty involved in reaching orbital velocity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
An advantage over three or more stages is reduction in complexity and fewer separation events, each of which reduces cost and risk of failure.[tpl]cite web|title=Falcon 1 - Stage Separation Reliability|url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon1.php#engine_reliability|publisher=SpaceX|accessdate=8 January 2011[/tpl]

Pinus bhutanica, which may be called the Bhutan white pine,  is a tree restricted to Bhutan and adjacent parts of northeast India and southwest China.  Along with the related Pinus wallichiana it is a constituent of lower altitude blue pine forests. This pine reaches a height of 25 meters. Note that P. wallichiana is sometimes called by the common name 'Bhutan pine'.
The needles are in bundles of five, up to 25 cm long. The cones are 12–20 cm in length, with thin scales; the seeds are 5–6 mm long, with a 20–25 mm wing. It differs from P. wallichiana in the much longer, strongly drooping needles, and the cones being slightly smaller and red-brown, rather than yellow-buff, when mature. It is also adapted to generally warmer, wetter climates at lower altitudes, with an intense summer monsoon. Despite the two being closely related and at least occasionally growing together, no hybrids or intermediates have ever been reported.

The New Community Movement, also known as the New Village Movement, Saemaeul Movement  or Saemaul Movement, was a political initiative launched on April 22, 1970 by South Korean president Park Chung Hee (박정희, 朴正熙) to modernize the rural South Korean economy. The idea was based on the Korean traditional communalism called Hyang-yak (향약) and Doorae (두레), which provided the rules for self-governing and cooperation in traditional Korean communities. The movement initially sought to rectify the growing disparity of the standard of living between the nation's urban centres, which were rapidly industrializing, and the small villages, which continued to be mired in poverty. Diligence, self-help and collaboration were the slogans to encourage community members to participate in the development process. The early stage of the movement focused on improving the basic living conditions and environments whereas later projects concentrated on building rural infrastructure and increasing community income.[tpl]cite web |title=South Korea - The Agricultural Crisis of the Late 1980s |url= http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12321.html|work= |publisher= www.countrydata.com |accessdate=13 July 2009[/tpl] Though hailed as a great success in the 1970s, the movement lost momentum during the 1980s as economic situation and political environment in South Korea changed rapidly.

The city is renowned for its seventeen norias used for watering the gardens, which are locally claimed to date back to 1100 BC. Though historically used for purpose of irrigation, the norias exist today as an almost entirely aesthetic traditional show.
In the last decades, the city of Hama has become known as a center of the anti-Ba'ath opposition in Syria, most notably the Muslim Brotherhood. The city was raided by the Syrian Army, beginning with the 1964 Islamic uprising, and becoming the scene of carnage during the Islamic uprising in Syria in April 1981 and especially in 1982, when nearly 25,000 people were killed in what became known as Hama massacre. The city was once again the site of conflict between the Syrian military and opposition forces, as one of the main arenas of the Syrian civil war in 2011 and 2012.

[[List of emperors of the Qing dynasty]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of Chinese monarchs, Qing dynasty emperors

The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) was the last imperial dynasty of China. It was officially founded in 1636 in what is now Northeast China, but only succeeded the Ming dynasty in China proper in 1644. The Qing period ended when the imperial clan (surnamed Aisin Gioro) abdicated in February 1912, a few months after a military uprising had started the Xinhai Revolution (1911) that led to the foundation of the Republic of China (1912–1949).
Nurhaci (1559–1626), khan of the Jurchens, founded the "Later Jin" in 1616 in reference to the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234) that had once reigned over north China. His son and successor Hong Taiji (1592–1643) renamed his people "Manchu" in 1635 and changed the name of Nurhaci's state from "Later Jin" to "Qing" in 1636. Hong Taiji was the real founder of Qing imperial institutions. He was the first to adopt the title of "emperor" (huangdi) and founded an Imperial Ancestral Temple in the Qing capital Mukden in 1636. After the Qing captured Beijing in 1644 and appropriated the Ming Ancestral Temple, from 1648 on, Nurhaci was worshiped there as Qing "Taizu", a temple name reserved for dynastic founders.
Like their Ming (1368–1644) predecessors—but unlike the emperors of earlier dynasties like the Han (206 BCE–220 CE), Tang (618–907), and Song (960–1276)—Qing emperors used only one era name ("Shunzhi", "Qianlong", "Guangxu", etc.) for their entire reign, and are most commonly known by that name. Starting with Nurhaci, there were thirteen Qing rulers. Following the capture of Beijing in 1644, the Shunzhi emperor (r. 1643–1661) became the first of the eleven Qing sovereigns to rule over China proper. At 61 years, the reign of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1661–1722) was the longest, though his grandson Qianlong (r. 1735–1796) would have reigned even longer if he had not purposely ceded the throne to the Jiaqing emperor (r. 1796–1820) in order not to reign longer than Kangxi. Qing emperors succeeded each other from father to son until the Tongzhi emperor (r. 1861–1874), the eleventh Qing ruler, died childess in 1874. The last two emperors were chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi from other branches of the imperial clan.

The best-selling console of this generation was the NES/Famicom, followed by the Master System (which dominated the European and South American markets) and then the Atari 7800. Although the previous generation of consoles had also used 8-bit processors, it was at the end of this generation that home consoles were first labeled by their "bits".

Walker's nickname was "The Pink Cat", and he gained some attention in the 1990s boxing scene for wearing pink boxing trunks and slicked-back hair, the latter a tribute to his idol, James Dean. He is best known for winning a ten round decision over hall-of-fame champion Alexis Argüello, ending Arguello's ill-conceived bid at a comeback in 1995. Walker fought another hall-of-famer Julio César Chávez in 1996 in a nationally televised bought, losing in a second-round knockout. Later in his career, Walker won the WBC Continental Americas light welterweight title over Francisco Cuesta on July 17, 1995. He retired with a record of 25–7–1 (13 KO's).
Walker was found dead in his home of unspecified causes. He is a member of the Arizona Boxing Hall of Fame.

The region's name lends itself to the Yeongdong Railway Line and Yeongdong Expressway, which are major transportation corridors connecting Seoul to Gangwon.

[tpl]About|a defunct semiconductor company|other uses of the term|Nextgen (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Nextgen[/tpl]

NexGen (Milpitas, California) was a private semiconductor company that designed x86 microprocessors until it was purchased by AMD in 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nexgen.com/  |title=The Nx586 Processor World: NexGen merged with AMD on January 16, 1996. |publisher=Nexgen |accessdate=1996-11-12 |date=1996-06-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19961112102704/http://www.nexgen.com/ |archivedate = 1996-11-12[/tpl]
Like competitor Cyrix, NexGen was a fabless design house that designed its chips but relied on other companies for production. NexGen's chips were produced by IBM's Microelectronics division.
The company was best known for the unique implementation of the x86 architecture in its processors. NexGen's CPUs were designed very differently from other processors based on the x86 instruction set at the time: the processor would translate code designed to run on the traditionally CISC-based x86 architecture to run on the chip's internal RISC architecture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cpu-collection.de/?l0=co&l1=NexGen&l2=Nx586|title=The NexGen Nx586 Processor |publisher=www.cpu-collection.de|accessdate=2010-12-23[/tpl] The architecture was used in later AMD chips such as the K6, and to an extent most x86 processors today implement a "hybrid" architecture similar to those used in NexGen's processors.

[[Middle relief pitcher]]
CATEGORIES: Baseball pitching, Baseball strategy

In baseball, middle relief pitchers (or "middle relievers") are relief pitchers who commonly pitch in the fifth, sixth, or seventh innings.[tpl]cite book|last=Dickson |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Dickson | title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary |year=2009| publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=544| isbn=978-0-393-06681-4[/tpl]  In the National League, a middle reliever often comes in after the starting pitcher has been pulled for a pinch hitter. A middle reliever is usually replaced in the eighth or ninth innings  by a left-handed specialist, setup pitcher or closers; middle relief pitchers may work these innings as well, especially if the game is not close.

[[Long reliever]]
CATEGORIES: Baseball pitching, Baseball strategy

A long reliever is a relief pitcher in baseball who enters the game if the starting pitcher leaves the game early.[tpl]cite book|title=Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball|first=Fran|last=Zimniuch|pages=154|publisher=Triumph Books|location=Chicago|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60078-312-8 |ref=zimniuch[/tpl]
Long relievers often enter in the first three innings of a game[tpl]cite book|last=Dickson |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Dickson | title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary |year=2009| publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=515| isbn=978-0-393-06681-4[/tpl] when the starting pitcher cannot continue, whether due to ineffective pitching, lack of endurance, rain delays, injury, or ejection. The hope is that the long reliever will be able to get the game under control, and hopefully his team's offense will be able to help get the team back into the game. The hope is also that the long reliever will pitch long enough to save other relievers in the bullpen from having to pitch.  
Long relievers are usually players who used to be starters either in the major leagues or in the minors (and still can be a temporary starter if one of the normal starters is injured or otherwise unavailable), but whose teams believe they have better starters available.  Sometimes a team's long reliever is a former starter who has lost his effectiveness, either through a decline in skills or a series of injuries. Occasionally, long relievers are inexperienced pitchers who may have the potential to become starters or set-up men after gaining major league experience.
The quality of long relievers can vary, but when the long reliever is known to be an ineffective former starter, he is often called the "mop up man" or "mop."
A secondary use of a long reliever is in the late extra innings of a tied game, once the team's other, generally more effective, relievers have already been used.  While a long reliever is often a team's least effective pitcher, he is still often a far better choice in an extended game than resorting to one of the team's starting pitchers (which can spread chaos throughout a pitching rotation, as everyone's future schedule gets adjusted), or even worse, resorting to a position player on the mound.  A long man generally enters the game somewhere between the 11th and 16th innings in this role, and can be expected to pitch 5 or more innings, before a team will be forced to resort to other options.  
Occasionally during the season, a team may find itself with enough rest days to allow it to use a four-man rotation rather than the now standard five.  In these situations, a team may choose to keep their "fifth" starter on the roster in the long reliever role.  This happens particularly in the post-season, when the fifth starter is a better pitcher than the "regular" long-reliever, allowing the team to carry either an additional short reliever, or position player, in lieu of the regular long man.
An example of a long reliever would be Chad Gaudin.[tpl]cite web |last=Frisaro |first=Joe |url=http://miami.marlins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120331&content_id=27783940&notebook_id=27794418&vkey=notebook_mia&c_id=mia |title=Marlins round out roster with Murphy, Gaudin |work=Marlins.MLB.com |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=February 21, 2013[/tpl]

Otto Wilhelm Fischer (1 April 1915 – 29 January 2004) was an Austrian actor. A leading man of German cinema, he began his career with Max Reinhardt's stage company.
He was born in Klosterneuburg near Vienna. While he enjoyed a great career, unlike countrymen Oskar Werner, Curd Jürgens, Maria Schell and Romy Schneider, he never made it internationally. Worse, his American break ended before it began: he was signed to star with June Allyson in a remake of My Man Godfrey in 1956, but was replaced by David Niven when Fischer reportedly lost his memory during filming. Fischer directed and starred opposite Anouk Aimée in a 1956 film, Ich suche Dich, based on the play, Jupiter Laughs, by A. J. Cronin.  In 1955, he directed and starred in Hanussen, a movie detailing the life of Erik Jan Hanussen, the Devil's Prophet. While the film is considered highly romanticized, it assisted historians and biographers in uncovering previously unknown facts. He also starred in the title role in the classic German film, Ludwig II.
In the early 1970s, he retired to concentrate on linguistics and philosophy, on which he lectured and published a number of books. He died in Lugano, Switzerland of kidney failure.

Michel Aflaq ([tpl]lang-ar|ميشيل عفلق[/tpl]‎, 1910 – 23 June 1989) was a Syrian philosopher, sociologist and Arab nationalist. His ideas played a significant role in the development of Ba'athism and its political movement; he is considered by several Ba'athists to be the principal founder of Ba'athist thought. He published various books during his lifetime, the most notable being The Battle for One Destiny (1958) and The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution (1975).
Born into a middle-class family in Damascus, Syria, Aflaq studied at the Sorbonne, where he met his future political companion Salah al-Din al-Bitar. He returned to Syria in 1932, and began his political career in communist politics. Aflaq became a communist activist, but broke his ties with the communist movement when the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party supported France's colonial policies. Later in 1940 Aflaq and al-Bitar established the Arab Ihya Movement (later renaming itself the Arab Ba'ath Movement, taking the name from Zaki al-Arsuzi's group by the same name). The movement proved successful, and in 1947 the Arab Ba'ath Movement merged with al-Arsuzi's Arab Ba'ath organisation to establish the Arab Ba'ath Party. Aflaq was elected to the party's executive committee and was elected "'Amid" (meaning the party's leader).
The Arab Ba'ath Party merged with Akram al-Hawrani's Arab Socialist Party to establish the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the party's leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, which eventually led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UAR's dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as Secretary General of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party. Following the 8th of March Revolution, Aflaq's position within the party was weakened to such an extent that he was forced to resign as the party's leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the 1966 Syrian coup d'état, which led to a schism within the Ba'ath Party. He escaped to Lebanon, but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected Secretary General of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party; during his tenure he held no de facto power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.
Aflaq's theories about society, economics and politics, which are collectively known as Ba'athism, hold that the Arab world needs to be unified into one Arab Nation in order to achieve an advanced state of development. He was critical of both capitalism and communism, and critical of Karl Marx's view of dialectical materialism as the only truth. Ba'athist thought placed much emphasis on liberty and Arab socialism – a socialism with Arab characteristics, which was not part of the international socialist movement as defined by the West. Aflaq believed in the separation of state and religion, and was a strong believer in secularisation, but was against atheism. Although a Christian, he believed Islam to be proof of "Arab genius". In the aftermath of the 1966 Ba'ath Party split, the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party accused Aflaq of stealing al-Arsuzi's ideas, and called him a "thief". The Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party rejects this, and does not believe that al-Arsuzi contributed to Ba'athist thought.

John Motley Morehead III (November 3, 1870 – January 7, 1965) was a chemist whose work provided much of the foundation for the business of Union Carbide Corporation.  He was a noted philanthropist who made major gifts to his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  He also served as mayor of Rye, New York and U.S. ambassador to Sweden.  His grandfather John Motley Morehead served as Governor of North Carolina.
Morehead graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in 1891 and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity.  One of his notable early scientific discoveries was the development of an economical process for the manufacture of calcium carbide.  He was also an authority on the analysis of gases, having invented a device for the purpose and written a book on the subject.
Morehead married Genevieve Margaret Birkhoff.  A few years after her death, he married Leila Duckworth Houghton.  He had no children.  He devoted his considerable fortune to philanthropy, especially to the benefit of UNC-Chapel Hill.  With a college classmate and fraternity brother, Rufus Lenoir Patterson, he donated the Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower on the campus.  He also gave the University the Morehead Planetarium, later renamed the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center.
One of Morehead's particular interests was in providing financial assistance to students attending UNC-Chapel Hill.  To that end he endowed the John Motley Morehead Foundation, which each year awards generous scholarships (for undergraduate work) and fellowships (for the graduate and professional schools) to applicants chosen through an extensive and competitive screening process.  The Morehead-Cain Scholarship is the oldest merit-based scholarship in the United States.
Morehead served as minister to Sweden from 1930 to 1933.
Descendants include Jean Motley Morehead Larkin, John L. Morehead, W. Harris Nelson, William H.M. Nelson III The Pilot (Pilot Mountain, North Carolina) http://www.nmainc.net.
There is a section of Interstate 40 named after him, called the John Motley Morehead III Freeway, that passes through Chapel Hill, North Carolina and most of the eastern end of Orange County.

[[Quebec general election, 1878]]
CATEGORIES: 1878 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1878 was held on May 1, 1878 to elect members of the 4th Legislative Assembly for the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Conservative Party, led by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, narrowly won the election, winning one seat more than the Quebec Liberal Party; however, in the immediate aftermath of the vote, Liberal leader Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, who was already sitting as premier, secured parliamentary backing to remain in office.
Joly de Lotbinière had become premier two months earlier when the previous Conservative premier Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville had resigned or was deposed by Lieutenant-Governor Luc Letellier de Saint-Just. He was therefore the incumbent. Boucher de Boucherville left the premier's office when the Lieutenant Governor refused to approve railway legislation that had been passed by the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, i.e., by both houses of the Quebec legislature.
Joly de Lotbinière did not quite win the election: the Conservatives won 32 seats to the Liberals' 31 (and there were two "Independent Conservatives"). Four Conservatives supported him, allowing him to form a minority government -- Quebec's last until 2007.
The Legislative Council pushed Joly de Lotbinière to resign on October 31, 1879, and Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau then took office.

Sir Louis-Olivier Taillon, PC (September 26, 1840 – April 25, 1923) was born in Terrebonne, Quebec. He twice served as the eighth Premier of the Canadian province of Quebec.  
Taillon's first term of office was just four days, from January 25 to January 29, 1887.  This term came at the end of the Conservative government of his predecessor John Jones Ross.  Ross had lost the 1886 Quebec election, but had tried to cling to power in a minority government for a few more months.
Taillon was Leader of the Opposition from 1887 until 1890, when he lost the 1890 election and his own seat.
He briefly returned to the practice of law, but following the removal of Liberal Honoré Mercier from office by the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, Taillon became minister without portfolio in the government of Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville.  Taillon became premier when Boucher de Boucherville resigned.
He resigned in 1896 and moved into federal politics to serve as Postmaster-General in the very short-lived federal Conservative government of Charles Tupper, from May to July 1896.  He failed to gain a federal seat in the 1896 federal election, and likewise failed to secure a seat in the 1900 federal election, ending his political career. In 1916, he was made a Knight Bachelor. He died in Montreal in 1923.

Sir Charles-Eugène-Napoléon Boucher de Boucherville, KCMG (May 4, 1822 – September 10, 1915) was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He twice served as the third Premier of Quebec.
Descended from Pierre Boucher, he was one of the three children of Pierre Boucher de Boucherville (1780-1857), Seigneur of Boucherville, and Marguerite-Émilie de Bleury (1786-1812), sister of Clément-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury.
Boucher de Boucherville took his MD from McGill University. During the Chauveau administration, he served as Speaker of the Legislative Council. He became premier in 1874 when his predecessor, Gédéon Ouimet, had to resign due to a financial scandal.  He then won the 1875 Quebec election, but was removed from office on March 8, 1878 in a conflict with Lieutenant Governor Luc Letellier de Saint-Just. Letellier de Saint-Just refused to approve legislation that had been passed by both houses of the Quebec legislature that would have forced municipalities to pay for railway construction. The Lieutenant-Governor deposed Boucher de Boucherville, and called on the Leader of the Opposition, Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, to form a government.
Boucher de Boucherville's second term came about after Honoré Mercier was removed from office by Lieutenant Governor Auguste-Réal Angers on December 16, 1891 on charges of corruption.  Mercier was later cleared.  
After Conservative leader Louis-Olivier Taillon had lost the 1890 election and his own seat, Jean Blanchet had taken over as Leader of the Opposition to the Mercier government. Blanchet, however, had resigned on September 19, 1891, to accept an appointment as a judge.  The Lieutenant Governor therefore needed a Conservative to fill the post of premier, and turned to Boucher de Boucherville.
Boucher de Boucherville served for one year, but resigned when former Conservative premier Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau was appointed Lieutenant-Governor in December 1892.  Relations between the two may have been strained. By 1915 the oldest legislator in North America, he died that year in Montreal at the Deaf and Dumb Institute, in whose work he was so interested that he lived there.

The song "Ten Cents a Dance" was introduced by Ruth Etting in this show. "Love Me Or Leave Me" by Gus Kahn and Walter Donaldson was interpolated into the show about two months after it opened.
"Dancing on the Ceiling", cut during the Broadway previews, was eventually sung by Jessie Matthews in the London production of Ever Green, and became a standard.

It rises in two forks in northwestern Colorado in northeastern Garfield County in the Flat Tops Wilderness Area in the White River National Forest. The North Fork rises in Wall Lake, and flows northwest, then southwest. The South Fork rises ten miles south of the north, flows southwest, then northwest, past Spring Cave. The two forks join near Buford in eastern Rio Blanco County, forming the White. It flows west, then northwest, past Meeker (site of the White River Museum), and across the broad valley between the Danforth Hills on the north and the Roan Plateau on the south. Downstream from Meeker, it is joined by Piceance Creek and Yellow Creek. In western Rio Blanco County, it turns southwest, flows past Rangely, where it is joined by Douglas Creek, and into Uintah County, Utah, where it joins the Green two miles south of Ouray.
The White River is navigable by small boats throughout most of its length. But in low water years the water level may be too low for navigation for a period of several months.

Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (March 8, 1841 – March 6, 1935) was an American jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1902 to 1932, and as Acting Chief Justice of the United States January–February 1930. Noted for his long service, his concise and pithy opinions and his deference to the decisions of elected legislatures, he is one of the most widely cited United States Supreme Court justices in history, particularly for his "clear and present danger" opinion for a unanimous Court in the 1919 case of Schenck v. United States, and is one of the most influential American common law judges, honored during his lifetime in Great Britain as well as the United States.  Holmes retired from the Court at the age of 90 years, 309 days, making him the oldest Justice in the Supreme Court's history. He also served as an Associate Justice and as Chief Justice on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and was Weld Professor of Law at the Harvard Law School, of which he was an alumnus.
Profoundly influenced by his experience fighting in the American Civil War, Holmes helped move American legal thinking towards legal realism, as summed up in his maxim: "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience."[tpl]cite book |first1=Oliver Wendell, Jr. |last1=Holmes |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449 |title=The Common Law |place=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1881 |volume=I[/tpl] Holmes espoused a form of moral skepticism and opposed the doctrine of natural law, marking a significant shift in American jurisprudence. As he wrote in one of his most famous decisions, his dissent in Abrams v. United States (1919), he regarded the United States Constitution as "an experiment, as all life is an experiment" and believed that as a consequence "we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death."Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919). During his tenure on the Supreme Court, to which he was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt, he supported efforts for economic regulation and advocated broad freedom of speech under the First Amendment. These positions as well as his distinctive personality and writing style made him a popular figure, especially with American progressives,Louis Menand, ed., Pragmatism: A Reader. New York: Vintage Books, 1997, pp. xxix. despite his deep cynicism and disagreement with their politics.Jeffrey Rosen, "Brandeis's Seat, Kagan's Responsibility". New York Times, July 2, 2010. Accessed July 5, 2010. His jurisprudence influenced much subsequent American legal thinking, including judicial consensus supporting New Deal regulatory law, and influential schools of pragmatism, critical legal studies, and law and economics. He was one of only a handful of justices to be known as a scholar; The Journal of Legal Studies has identified Holmes as one of the three most cited American legal scholars of the 20th century.[tpl]cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Fred R. |year=2000 |title=The Most-Cited Legal Scholars |journal=Journal of Legal Studies |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=409–426 |doi=10.1086/468080 [/tpl]

[[Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia]]

CATEGORIES: Specialized encyclopedias, Boxing books, The Ring (magazine)

The Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia is a book published yearly by Ring Magazine. 
Ring editor Nat Fleischer, noting that other sports had record books and that boxing did not have any books specialized in keeping fans up to date as far as the participants' records, began writing the first Ring boxing encyclopedia in 1941. It was published for the first time in 1942. Fleischer wanted to create a book that would keep fans informed about the history of boxing and their favorite fighters, and, at the same time, help fighters' managers and promoters choose who their protégé's next opponent should be. It also included a detailed history of title fights for each division, and a section of a list of boxing record setters.
With time, the book would also include round by round scoring for each title fight held on the year prior. At its peak, the book consisted of close to 600 pages of records and stats. 
After Fleischer died in 1972, Stanley Weston took over the production and edition of the yearly encyclopedia book. During this period, Ring Record book and boxing Encyclopedias were hard-cover books, with a glossy, outside cover that had color photos of famous modern fighters of the era.
In 1990, Ring Magazine went bankrupt, and the Ring Encyclopedia stopped being produced. In 1992, Ring Magazine returned to the stands, but it wasn't until 1994 that the encyclopedia returned.
The new version of the Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia is a smaller, pocket sized book with a different context separating it from the original one. It is a soft cover book that covers the history of each division, but including only the fights where world titles changed hands. It also includes a recap of title fights held the year before, but without the judges' scorecards for any of the fights. It only has the records of current world champions (except WBO ones, as Ring Magazine has always refused to recognize WBO world champions as such), and of leading contenders. It also has a recap of Ring's articles of the past twelve months. Currently, the encyclopedic books are edited by Steve Farhood.
The original version of the encyclopedia, which was a mail-order item, topped at a price of 25 dollars. Many books in the original format are now collector's items, and as such, their prices have gone up. The new version usually sells for 5 dollars at many supermarkets and other stores.

Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. (August 29, 1809 – October 7, 1894) was an American physician, poet, professor, lecturer, and author based in Boston. A member of the Fireside Poets, his peers acclaimed him as one of the best writers of the day. His most famous prose works are the "Breakfast-Table" series, which began with The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table (1858). He was also an important medical reformer.
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Holmes was educated at Phillips Academy and Harvard College. After graduating from Harvard in 1829, he briefly studied law before turning to the medical profession. He began writing poetry at an early age; one of his most famous works, "Old Ironsides", was published in 1830 and was influential in the eventual preservation of the USS Constitution. Following training at the prestigious medical schools of Paris, Holmes was granted his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1836. He taught at Dartmouth Medical School before returning to teach at Harvard and, for a time, served as dean there. During his long professorship, he became an advocate for various medical reforms and notably posited the controversial idea that doctors were capable of carrying puerperal fever from patient to patient. Holmes retired from Harvard in 1882 and continued writing poetry, novels and essays until his death in 1894.
Surrounded by Boston's literary elite—which included friends such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell—Holmes made an indelible imprint on the literary world of the 19th century. Many of his works were published in The Atlantic Monthly, a magazine that he named. For his literary achievements and other accomplishments, he was awarded numerous honorary degrees from universities around the world. Holmes's writing often commemorated his native Boston area, and much of it was meant to be humorous or conversational. Some of his medical writings, notably his 1843 essay regarding the contagiousness of puerperal fever, were considered innovative for their time. He was often called upon to issue occasional poetry, or poems written specifically for an event, including many occasions at Harvard. Holmes also popularized several terms, including "Boston Brahmin" and "anesthesia".

[[Uncompahgre River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Colorado, Rivers of Ouray County, Colorado, Geography of San Juan County, Colorado, Tributaries of the Colorado River in Colorado

The Uncompahgre River is a tributary of the Gunnison River, approximately 75 mi (121 km) long, in southwestern Colorado in the United States.  Lake Como at 12,215 ft (3723m) in northern San Juan County, in the Uncompahgre National Forest in the northwestern San Juan Mountains is the headwaters of the river. It flows northwest past Ouray, Ridgway, Montrose, and Olathe and joins the Gunnison at Confluence Park in Delta.
The river forms Poughkeepsie Gulch and the Uncompahgre Gorge.  The major tributaries are all creeks draining the northwest San Juan Mountains.
There are two dams on the Uncompahgre River, a small diversion dam in the Uncompahgre Gorge, and Ridgway Dam below the town of Ridgway which forms Ridgway Reservoir.
The river is used for irrigation in the Uncompahgre Valley. Additionally, water from the Gunnison is diverted to the valley via the Gunnison Tunnel. The Uncompahgre is unnavigable except at high water.
The name given to the river comes from the Ute word Uncompaghre, which loosely translates to "dirty water" or "red water spring" and is likely a reference to the many hot springs in the vicinity of Ouray.In the journal of Francisco Silvestre Vélez de Escalante's 1776 expedition,http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/gateway/diario/diary.html the author states that the Native American name for the river was Ancapagari, which translated to Spanish as Laguna Colorado and referred to a hot, bad tasting, red lake from which its waters came. The Spanish name for the river at that time was Rio de San Francisco, apparently so named by explorer Juan Maria de Rivera on one of his two earlier expeditions (1761 and 1765).

[[Proprietary Governor]]

CATEGORIES: Colonial government in America, Governance of the British Empire

Proprietary Governors were individuals authorized to govern proprietary colonies. Under the proprietary system, individuals or companies were granted commercial charters by the monarchs of the Kingdom of England to establish colonies. These proprietors then selected the governors and other officials in the colony. This system was used to establish several colonies on the island of Newfoundland. The provinces of Maryland, Carolina and several other colonies in the Americas were initially established under the proprietary system. 
These colonies were distinct from royal colonies in that they were commercial enterprises established under authority of the crown. Proprietary Governors had legal responsibilities over the colony as well as responsibilities to shareholders to ensure the security of their investments.  
The proprietary system was a mostly inefficient system, in that the proprietors were, for the most part, like absentee landlords. Many never even visited the colonies they owned. By the early 18th century, nearly all of the proprietary colonies had either surrendered their charters to the crown to become royal colonies, or else had significant limitations placed on them by the crown.

Jill Sobule (born January 16, 1965 in Denver, Colorado) is an American singer-songwriter best known for the 1995 single "I Kissed a Girl", and "Supermodel" from the soundtrack of the 1995 film Clueless. Her folk-inflected compositions alternate between ironic, story-driven character studies and emotive ballads, a duality reminiscent of such 1970s American songwriters as Warren Zevon, Harry Nilsson, Loudon Wainwright III, Harry Chapin, and Randy Newman. Autobiographical elements, including Sobule's Jewish heritage and her adolescent battles with anorexia and depression, frequently occur in Sobule's writing. An appreciable percentage of her work is also dedicated to detailed accounts of both her own fictional female creations and such troubled but celebrated women as Joey Heatherton and Mary Kay Letourneau, whose stories are usually used to make ironic comments about fame and celebrity.

The Legislative Assembly of Quebec (French: Assemblée Législative du Québec) was the name of the lower house of Quebec's legislature until December 31, 1968, when it was renamed the National Assembly of Quebec.  At the same time, the upper house of the legislature, the Legislative Council, was abolished.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.revolutiontranquille.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=104&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=185 |title=L’Assemblée législative devient l’Assemblée nationale: 31 décembre 1968 |language=French |work=Révolution tranquille |publisher=Government of Quebec |accessdate=February 19, 2012[/tpl]  Both were initially created by the Constitutional Act of 1791.
It was the Union Nationale government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand that passed the "Bill 90" legislation to abolish the upper house, although earlier unsuccessful attempts had been made by earlier governments.
The presiding officer of the Assembly was known in French as "''Orateur,''" a literal translation of the English term, "speaker".   When the Assembly was renamed so too was the title of its presiding officer, becoming known as the President.
Today Quebec has a unicameral legislature, whose single house is the National Assembly.
The large chamber housing the assembly is also known as le salon bleu (the blue hall) because of the predominance of this colour on the walls.  It used to be known as le salon vert (the green hall) until 1978, when the colour was changed to suit televising of parliamentary debates.

[[Mindset computer]]

CATEGORIES: Computer workstations, IBM PC compatibles

The Mindset was sold around spring of 1984 as a high-end graphics workstation which was somewhat PC compatible. Based on Intel's 80186, it had proprietary VLSI chips that enhanced and sped up the graphics. It also had dual front-mounted ROM cartridge ports which had a unique locking knob on the left side of the main computer module to lock the ROM modules into place.  The Mindset had the option (through its System Configuration Utility) to be able to select whether the system booted from Left or Right ROM carts, or Disk Drive.
A dual 5.25 floppy drive module that sat above the main unit was available and part of the common sales configuration for the system. The module also included Expansion memory as well.
The case was well designed and distinctive enough to get it into the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
Mindset's design was modular in many aspects. The top of the case had an opening to access its systems bus, this allowed for the expansion module to plug into the main computer module to add memory and one or two disk drives. The Mindset was designed by several ex-Atari engineers like the Amiga 1000, another computer of the era with an advanced graphics subsystem and modular expandability. Jack Tramiel (forming TTL - Tramiel Technologies Limited) tried to buy Mindset's technology in Spring of 1984.
While released in 1984, models of the M1001 Mindset computer with BIOS ROM code 1.07 and earlier show a copyright notice of (c) 1983 Mindset Computer Corp.
The Base System Unit was referred to as Model M1001, later a "Mindset II" computer was released, basically the same exact case as the Mindset M1001, just with an adhesive label designating "II" under the embossed name. Internally the Video Processor Board is a separate mini-daughterboard. Its enhanced functionality is not totally understood - but from the "Mindset II Advanced Professional Videographics System" users guide it makes mention "Chaining" Two Mindset's:
"It is possible to genlock any Mindset System to a Mindset II. In such a case, the composite video output of one Mindset is used as an external video source for the Video Production Module connected to the Mindset II. It is very important that the Mindset System being used as a video source be set in the interlaced mode. Otherwise, vertical locking will not occur.
The Mindset II is referred to on the front of the user guide as Model# M1500, however other internal pages reference is an M1000-II and also make mention of Mindset Video Production Module Model# M1011.

[[Legislative Council of Quebec]]

CATEGORIES: Members of the Legislative Council of Quebec, Quebec Legislature, Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories, Defunct upper houses, Political history of Quebec

From 1867 until 1968, the Legislative Council of Quebec (French; Conseil législatif du Québec) was the unelected upper house of the bicameral legislature in the Canadian province of Quebec. The Legislative Assembly was the elected lower house.
The Council was composed of 24 members, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor upon recommendation of the Premier.  Each councillor nominally represented a portion of the Province of Quebec called a division. The boundaries of these divisions were identical to the ones used for Canada East by the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada and were also identical to the boundaries still used today by the Senate of Canada for Quebec. The division boundaries were never changed to accommodate the territorial expansion of Quebec in 1898 and 1912.
Members were originally appointed for life. In 1963 the rule was changed to force members to retire at age 75, but this did not apply to already-appointed members. In the event, the change remained entirely theoretical since the Council was abolished before it could be applied to anyone.
The Council had the right to introduce bills, except of a financial nature, and to amend or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly. Its speaker, known in French as Orateur, was by right a member of the Cabinet, and its members could serve as ministers or even Premier. Two Quebec premiers, Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville and John Jones Ross were members of the Legislative Council.
Effective December 31, 1968 the Legislative Council was abolished, and the Legislative Assembly of Quebec was renamed the National Assembly.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.revolutiontranquille.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=104&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=185 |title=L’Assemblée législative devient l’Assemblée nationale: 31 décembre 1968 |language=French |work=Révolution tranquille |publisher=Government of Quebec |accessdate=February 19, 2012[/tpl]   As a consequence, Quebec has a unicameral legislature.  The establishment of the original system dates back to the Constitutional Act of 1791.
The Union Nationale government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand passed the  legislation, known as "Bill 90", to implement the change.  Previous governments had made unsuccessful attempts to eliminate the upper chamber.  In fact, the first attempt dated all the way back to Félix-Gabriel Marchand in the late nineteenth century.  Quebec was the last Canadian province to abolish its upper house.
The large chamber which used to house the Legislative Council is also known in French as le salon rouge (the red hall) and in English as "the Red Room" because of the predominance of this colour on the walls.   It is now used for committee meetings and for important state functions that require a large, impressive hall, such as inductions into the National Order of Quebec.
When it was dissolved the standings were: Union Nationale - 15, Liberal - 9.

Haldir is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's  fictional universe of Middle-earth. He is introduced in The Silmarillion as a Chieftain of the Folk of Haleth in the First Age. He was the elder son of Halmir and married Glóredhel of the House of Hador, the elder sister of Galdor the Tall who married Haldir's sister Hareth. The son of Haldir and Glóredhel was Handir and their grandson Brandir the Lame.
As a son-in-law of Hador, he fostered Hareth's sons Huor and Húrin in Brethil, as was the custom of the Edain in those times. With them he joined the ambush of Orcs that came from the Pass of Sirion soon after the Dagor Bragollach, and the forces of his father Halmir utterly defeated the enemies.
After his father prepared the Folk of Brethil to join the Union of Maedhros, Haldir obeyed the summons of Fingon, and with Hundar his brother he led many warriors to the Nírnaeth Arnoediad and joined the forces of Húrin, now Lord of Dor-lómin.
Haldir was slain with most of his men in the rearguard of Fingon's retreating army.[tpl]ME-ref|Silm|"Of the Fifth Battle"[/tpl] To Brethil only three men returned, and learning the news of the fall of her husband, Glóredhel grieved and died.

Akbar II (1760–1837 CE), also known as Akbar Shah II, was the penultimate Mughal emperor of India. He reigned from 1806 to 1837. He was the second son of Shah Alam II and the father of Bahadur Shah II.
Akbar had little de-facto power due to the increasing British control of India through the East India Company. Shortly before his death, he sent Ram Mohan Roy as an ambassador to Britain. During his regime, in 1835, the East India Company (EIC) discontinued calling itself the lieutenant of the Mughal Emperor and issuing coins in his name. The Persian lines in the Company's coins to this effect were deleted.
His grave lies next to the dargah of 13th century Sufi saint Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki at Mehrauli, in a marble enclosure, along with that of Bahadur Shah I (also known as Shah Alam I) and Shah Alam II.

[[Heat pipe]]
CATEGORIES: Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning, Computer hardware cooling, Heat conduction, Spacecraft components, Heat transfer

A heat pipe or heat pin is a heat-transfer device that combines the principles of both thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently manage the transfer of heat between two solid interfaces.
At the hot interface of a heat pipe a liquid in contact with a thermally conductive solid surface turns into a vapor by absorbing heat from that surface. The vapor then travels along the heat pipe to the cold interface and condenses back into a liquid - releasing the latent heat. The liquid then returns to the hot interface through either capillary action, centrifugal force, or gravity, and the cycle repeats. Due to the very high heat transfer coefficients for boiling and condensation, heat pipes are highly efficient thermal conductors. The effective thermal conductivity varies with heat pipe length, and can approach 100,000 W/m K for long heat pipes, in comparison with approximately 400 W/m K for copper.

[[Death by natural causes]]
CATEGORIES: Causes of death, Medical terminology

A death by natural causes, as recorded by coroners and on death certificates and associated documents, is one that is primarily attributed to an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly influenced by external forces. For example, a person dying from complications from influenza (an infection) or a heart attack (an internal body malfunction) would be listed as having died from natural causes. Old age is not a scientifically recognized cause of death; there is always a more direct cause although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of aging-associated diseases.
In contrast, death caused by active intervention is called unnatural death.  The "unnatural" causes are usually given as accident (implying no unreasonable voluntary risk), misadventure (accident following a willful and dangerous risk), suicide, or homicide.[tpl]Cite book|author=Bryant, Clifton D. |title=Handbook of death & dying |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |year=2003 |pages=968 |isbn=0-7619-2514-7 |oclc= |doi=[/tpl]  In some settings, other categories may be added.

Its original political goal was to define and advance the Indian Muslim's civil rights and to provide protection to upper and gentry class of Indian Muslims. From 1906–30s, the party worked on its organizational structure, its credibility in all over the Muslim communities of British Indian Empire, and lacked as a mass organisation but represented the landed and commercial Muslim interests of the United Provinces (today's Uttar Pradesh).[tpl]cite book|author=John Keay|title=India: A History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3aeQqmcXBhoC&pg=PA468|year=2001|publisher=Grove Press|page=468[/tpl]

After the partition and subsequent establishment of Pakistan, the Muslim League continued as a minor party in India where it was often part of the government.

A Navvab or Nawaab ([tpl]lang-ur|نوّاب[/tpl]) is an honorific title ratified and bestowed by the reigning Mughal Emperor to semi-autonomous Muslim rulers of princely states in South Asia. "Nawab" usually refers to males; the female equivalent is "Begum" or "Nawab Begum". The primary duty of a Nawab was to uphold the sovereignty of the Mughal Emperor alongside with the administration of a certain province.
The title of "Nawab" was also awarded as a personal distinction by the paramount power, similar to a British peerage, to persons and families who ruled a princely state, for various services to the Government of British India. In some cases, these titles were also accompanied by jagir grants, either in cash revenues and allowances or land-holdings. In the British Punjab, North West Frontier Province, Sindh and Balochistan, some of the chiefs or Sardars of large or important tribes were also given the title, in addition to traditional titles already held by virtue of chieftainship.
The term "Nawab" was originally used for the Subahdar (provincial governor) or viceroy of a Subah (province) or region of the Mughal empire.

He was an iconic figure in the cultural history of the Indian subcontinent. He was a mystic and a spiritual disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi. Amīr Khusrow has been reputed to have invented musical instruments Sitar and Tabla. He wrote poetry primarily in Persian, but also in Hindavi. A vocabulary in verse, the Ḳhāliq Bārī, containing Arabic, Persian, and Hindavi terms'' is often attributed to him.[tpl]cite news|last=Rashid|first=Omar|title=Chasing Khusro|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3672990.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 August 2012|location=Chennai, India|date=23 July 2012[/tpl]
He is regarded as the "father of Qawwali" (a devotional music form of the Sufis in the Indian subcontinent). Introduced the Ghazal style of song into India. These music styles are still used widely in India and Pakistan.Regula Burckhardt Qureshi, Harold S. Powers. Sufi Music of India. Sound, Context and Meaning in Qawwali. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 4 (Oct. – Dec. 1989), pp. 702–705. [tpl]doi|10.2307/604123[/tpl]. He is also credited with introducing Persian, Arabic and Turkish elements into Indian classical music and was the originator of the khayal and tarana styles of music.
Khusrow was an expert in many styles of Persian poetry which were developed in medieval Persia, from Khāqānī's qasidas to Nizami's  khamsa. He used 11 metrical schemes with 35 distinct divisions. He has written in many verse forms including Ghazal, Masnavi, Qata, Rubai, Do-Beti and Tarkibhand. His contribution to the development of the g͟hazal, is significant.A.

Americana is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band The Offspring, released on November 17, 1998 (see 1998 in music). Following a worldwide tour in support of its previous album, Ixnay on the Hombre (1997), The Offspring commenced work on a new album. The music on the album marked a change, expanding their sound and exploring more pop punk elements.
Americana was a huge commercial success, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 with around 175,000 copies sold in its first week[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] and peaking at number two for two nonconsecutive weeks, spending 22 weeks nonconsecutive in the top 10, becoming the Offspring's highest ever chart position. It is the band's second best selling album to their 1994 breakout Smash. Americana has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockfreaks.net/?page=albumreviews&id=2023 |title=The Offspring - Americana |publisher=Rockfreaks.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09[/tpl] with over 9 million copies certified, while going 5x platinum in the United States for 5 million copies shipped. The album contains the hit singles "Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)", "Why Don't You Get a Job?" and "The Kids Aren't Alright" being the band's 3 biggest hits to date all crossing over from mainstream rock and alt-rock radio to Top 40 pop radio stations and sharing the similar success to the singles from Smash. "She's Got Issues" was the last single from the album and it only received some moderate success and it was not as popular or successful as its 3 prior hit singles making the song an unsuccessful finish for the album. The singles (except "She's Got Issues") can also be heard on the band's Greatest Hits compilation.
The Compact Disc version of the album also featured, "The Meaning Of Life" music video from the 1997 album,"Ixnay On the Hombre" playable on DVD ROM. 
Americana was nominated for the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Album, but lost to Boyzone's By Request. The Offspring supported the album with a worldwide tour and appeared at the infamous Woodstock 1999, where their performance was broadcast live on pay-per-view television.

or Pericope de Adultera is a traditional name for a famous passage (pericope) about Jesus and the woman taken in adultery from verses [tpl]bibleverse-nb||John|7:53-8:11[/tpl] of the Gospel of John. The passage describes a confrontation between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees over whether a woman, caught in an act of adultery, ought to be stoned. Jesus shames the crowd into dispersing, and averts the execution.
Although in line with many stories in the Gospels and probably primitive (Didascalia Apostolorum refers to it, possibly Papias also), certain critics[tpl]cite web | title = NETBible: John 7 | publisher = Bible.org | url = http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Joh&chapter=7#n139 | accessdate = 2009-10-17[/tpl] See note 139 on that page.[tpl]cite journal | last = Keith | first = Chris | title = Recent and Previous Research on the Pericope Adulterae (John 7.53—8.11) | journal = Currents in Biblical Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–404 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1177/1476993X07084793[/tpl] argue that it was "certainly not part of the original text of St John's Gospel."'Pericope adulterae', in FL Cross (ed.), The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005). On the other hand, the Council of Trent declared that the Latin Vulgate was authentic and authoritative.[tpl]cite web | title = Council of Trent Session 4, Dec. 1 | url = http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct04.html | accessdate = 2011-01-13[/tpl]  The Latin Vulgate includes the adultery episode in John 7:53-8:11.
The parable, and its messages of suspension of judgment when one is not blameless and tempering justice with mercy, have endured in Christian thought.  Both "let him who is without sin, cast the first stone"E.g., Britni Danielle, "Cast the First Stone: Why Are We So Judgmental?", Clutch, Feb 21, 2011 and "go, and sin no more"E.g., Mudiga Affe, Gbenga Adeniji, and Etim Ekpimah, "Go and sin no more, priest tells Bode George", The Punch, 27 Feb 2011. have found their way into common usage. The English idiomatic phrase to "cast the first stone" is derived from this passage.The Phrase Finder  The passage has been taken as confirmation of Jesus' ability to write (as opposed to read—in early societies many more people could read than write), otherwise only suggested by implication in the Gospels, but the word "εγραφεν" in 8:8 could mean "draw" as well as "write".An uncommon usage, evidently not found in the LXX, but supported in Liddell & Scott's Greek-English Lexicon (8th ed., NY, 1897) s.v. γραμμα, page 317 col. 2, citing (among others) Herodotus (repeatedly) including 2:73 ("I have not seen one except in an illustration") & 4:36 ("drawing a map"). See also, Chris Keith, The Pericope Adulterae, the Gospel of John, and the Literacy of Jesus (2009, Leiden, Neth., Brill) page 19.
The subject of Jesus' writing on the ground was fairly common in art, especially from the Renaissance onwards; Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery by Pieter Bruegel is a famous example.  There was a medieval tradition, originating in a comment attributed to Ambrose, that the words written were terra terram accusat ("earth accuses earth"),This phrase terra terram accusat is also given in the Gospel Book of Hitda of Maschede and a ninth-century glossa, Codex Sangelensis 292, and a sermon by Jacques de Voragine attributes the use of these words to Ambrose and Augustine, and other phrases to the Glossa Ordinaria and John Chrysostom, who is usually considered as not referencing the Pericope. - see  Knust, Jennifer; Wasserman, Tommy, "Earth accuses earth: tracing what Jesus wrote on the ground", Harvard Theological Review, October 01, 2010 which is shown in some depictions in art, for example the Codex Egberti. There have been other speculative suggestions as to what was written.

A pericope ([tpl]IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|k|ə|p|iː[/tpl]; Greek [tpl]lang|grc|περικοπή[/tpl], "a cutting-out") in rhetoric is a set of verses that forms one coherent unit or thought, suitable for public reading from a text, now usually of sacred scripture.
Manuscripts, often illuminated, called Pericopes, are normally abbreviated Gospel Books only containing the sections of the Gospels required for the Masses of the liturgical year. Notable examples, both Ottonian, are the Pericopes of Henry II and the Salzburg Pericopes.
Lectionaries are normally made up of pericopes containing the Epistle and Gospel readings for the liturgical year. A pericope consisting of passages from different parts of a single book, or from different books of the Bible, and linked together into a single reading is called a concatenation or composite reading.

[[Biblical criticism]]

CATEGORIES: Biblical criticism, Christian terms

Biblical criticism is the scholarly "study and investigation of biblical writings that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings".Harper's Bible Dictionary, 1985 Viewing biblical texts as having human rather than supernatural origins, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey. It will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the Old Testament, the letters of New Testament or the Canonical gospels. It also plays an important role in the quest for a Historical Jesus.
It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including archaeology, anthropology, folklore, linguistics, Oral Tradition studies, and historical and religious studies.

Cardiff, New York is a small hamlet in Onondaga County, New York, located south of Syracuse. It was named after Cardiff, the capital of Wales.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

It was the site of the William C. "Stub" Newell farm where the "Cardiff Giant", a famous hoax, was "discovered" on October 16, 1869.
In 1993, Cardiff experienced a landslide where part of Bear Mountain rolled over houses and trapped a few residents. The early afternoon of April 27 changed the lives of many people who lived on Tully Farms Road. Properties were covered in mud and clay, 15 feet high in some places.

[[NACDA Directors' Cup]]

CATEGORIES: College sports trophies and awards in the United States

The NACDA Learfield Sports Directors' Cup is an award given annually by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics to the colleges and universities in the United States with the most success in collegiate athletics.  Points for the NACDA Directors' Cup are based on order of finish in various National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sponsored championships or, in the case of Division I Football, media-based polls.  The award originated in 1993, and was presented to NCAA Division I schools only.  In 1995 it was extended to Division II, Division III, and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) schools as well, each division receiving its own award.
Stanford University has won the Division I award for nineteen straight years. Williams College has had similar success Division III, having won the award sixteen times. 
In Division II, UC Davis won six of the first eight awards, but its athletic program moved to Division I in 2003 and Grand Valley State won the award the following eight years.  The NAIA division was similarly dominated by Simon Fraser University of British Columbia in its early years, but in 2002, SFU transferred several of its sports programs to Canada's college athletics federation, Canadian Interuniversity Sport. From 2004 to 2012, Azusa Pacific University assumed the mantle at the NAIA level, winning eight consecutive championships before moving to Division II in the 2012–2013 season.
The physical award is a Waterford crystal trophy.  Prior to 2003, the sponsor of the NACDA Directors' Cup was retail merchandiser Sears, and the award was known as the Sears Cup.  Beginning in the 2003–2004 season, the sponsor was the United States Sports Academy.  In 2007–2008, Learfield Sports assumed the sponsorship of the Directors' Cup.

The Murray–Darling basin is a large geographical area in the interior of southeastern Australia, whose name  is derived from its two major rivers, the Murray River and the Darling River. It drains around one-seventh of the Australian land mass, and is one of the most significant agricultural areas in Australia.  It spans most of the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory, and parts of the states of Queensland (lower third) and South Australia (southeastern corner). It is [tpl]convert|3375|km|mi[/tpl] in length (the Murray River is [tpl]convert|2530|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long).
Most of the [tpl]convert|1061469|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] basin is flat, low-lying and far inland, and receives little direct rainfall. The many rivers it contains tend to be long and slow-flowing, and carry a volume of water that is large only by Australian standards.

[[Repurchase agreement]]
CATEGORIES: Derivatives (finance), Financial terminology, Money market instruments

A repurchase agreement, also known as a repo, RP, or sale and repurchase agreement,  is the sale of securities together with an agreement for the seller to buy back the securities at a later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest, sometimes called the repo rate. The party that originally buys the securities effectively acts as a lender.  The original seller is effectively acting as a  borrower, using their security as collateral for a secured cash loan at a fixed rate of interest.
A repo is almost equivalent to a spot sale combined with a forward contract. The spot sale results in transfer of money to the borrower in exchange for legal transfer of the security to the lender, while the forward contract ensures repayment of the loan to the lender and return of the collateral of the borrower. The difference between the forward price and the spot price is effectively the interest on the loan, while the settlement date of the forward contract is the maturity date of the loan.

Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts, was founded in 1831 as "America's first garden cemetery" or "rural cemetery". With classical monuments set in a rolling landscaped terrain, it marked a distinct break with Colonial-era burying grounds and church-affiliated graveyards. The appearance of this type of landscape coincides with the rising popularity of the term "cemetery", derived from the Greek for "a sleeping place." This language and outlook eclipsed the previous harsh view of death and the afterlife embodied by old graveyards and church burial plots.Bernhard Lang and Colleen McDaniel, Heaven: A History. Yale University Press, 2001. The [tpl]convert|174|acre|ha|adj=on|lk=on[/tpl] cemetery is important both for its historical aspects and for its role as an arboretum. It is Watertown’s largest contiguous open space and extends into Cambridge to the east, adjacent to the Cambridge City and Sand Banks Cemeteries.

He is one of the great saints of the Chishti order in India.Bhakti poetry in medieval India By Neeti M. Sadarangani. Pg 60 His predecessors were Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Bakhtiyar Kaki and Moinuddin Chishti. In that sequence, they constitute the initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chisti order, widely prevalent in the Indian subcontinent.
Nizamuddin Auliya, like his predecessors, stressed love as a means of realising God. For him his love of God implied a love of humanity. His vision of the world was marked by a highly evolved sense of secularity and kindness.Bhakti poetry in medieval India By Neeti M. Sadarangani. Pg 63 It is claimed by the 14th century historiographer Ziauddin Barani that his influence on the Muslims of Delhi was such that a paradigm shift was effected in their outlook towards worldly matters.

Poplar Forest was Thomas Jefferson's plantation and plantation house in what is now Forest, Bedford County, Virginia, near Lynchburg. He designed it and treated it as a private retreat, working on it from 1806 until his death 20 years later. Jefferson once wrote a correspondent saying "It is the most valuable of my possessions." Skilled slave-labor was used in its construction.
Known as the architect of such buildings as Monticello, the University of Virginia, and the Virginia State Capitol, Jefferson built the more remote and lesser-known Poplar Forest as a place to escape the hordes of visitors at Monticello and seek the "solitude of a hermit."  It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/69000223.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Poplar Foresta|date=June 2, 1969 |format=PDF |author=Staff, Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission James W.

Lake Mweru Wantipa (also spelled 'Mweru-wa-Ntipa' and also called 'Mweru Marsh') is a lake and swamp system in the Northern Province of Zambia. It has been regarded in the past as something of mystery, displaying fluctuations in water level and salinity which were not entirely explained by variation in rainfall levels; it has been known to dry out almost completely.W. V. Brelsford: “The Problem of Mweru-Wantipa”, The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol 2, No 5 (1954) This is compounded by its remoteness and it not receiving the same attention from geographers and geologists as its larger and more accessible neighbours, Lake Tanganyika, 25 km east, and Lake Mweru, 40 km west, with which its name is sometimes confused.
Lake Mweru Wantipa is a rift valley lake lying in a branch of the East African Rift, running from the Luapula River to Lake Tanganyika. There are some hot springs characteristics of a rift valley to the east. Its water is muddy in appearance, at times appearing reddish and 'slightly oily'. In the local dialect "wa ntipa" means "with mud", hence "Mweru Wantipa" distinguishes it from its bigger neighbour Mweru with clearer water.Camerapix: "Spectrum Guide to Zambia", Camerapix International Publishers, Nairobi, 1996

James Robert Wilson, PC (September 16, 1866 – April 3, 1941) was a Canadian politician. 
Born in Almonte, Canada West, he moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan in 1884 and was employed at a grocery and hardware store. During the 1885 North-West Rebellion he led the first medical corps to Saskatoon.  After the rebellion he worked as a farmer, before opening a general store in Saskatoon in 1896.
In January 1903 he was elected overseer over the village of Saskatoon, and when on July 1 of that year the village was incorporated as a town, he became its first mayor.  He served until 1904, and again later as mayor of the by now city of Saskatoon from 1907-1908.  He also sat on the city council from 1914-1919.
In his times as mayor he personally guaranteed a bank loan that allowed for the completion of sewer, water and electrical works, and it was also whilst he was mayor that Saskatoon's City Park was purchased.
Wilson also tried his hand at national politics, standing unsuccessfully as a federal candidate for the Conservatives in 1908, before managing to be elected in 1917.  He served for four years, including a spell as a cabinet minister, before being defeated in 1921.

[[Newent]]
CATEGORIES: Forest of Dean, Market towns in Gloucestershire, Towns in Gloucestershire, Post towns in the GL postcode area

Newent (originally called "Noent") is a small market town about 8 miles north west of Gloucester, on the northern edge of the Forest of Dean, and lying within the Forest of Dean Local Authority District. Its population at the 2001 census was 5,073. The town includes a half-timbered market house, other houses of historical nature, and the site of the former small Victorian museum, the Shambles, containing a replica of a 19th-century street has been transformed and now real local traders occupy the once replica shops. There has been a settlement here since at least Roman times and the town first appeared in the Domesday Book.
Newent's church, St Mary's, dates from the 13th century but the site has been used since the Anglo-Saxon period. St Mary's Church has stained glass windows from the famous company of Clayton and Bell.
Newent is home to the Devonia, a large house dating back to the Georgian period.
Newent was served by the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal, which opened between Gloucester and Ledbury in 1798. The canal closed on 30 June 1881 and the section between Ledbury and Gloucester converted into a railway line. This line, which was a branch of the Great Western Railway, opened on 27 July 1885."Railway Magazine", April 1958 The original course of the canal between Dymock and Newent was by-passed as it was decided not to take the line through the 2,192 yard Oxenhall Tunnel. Newent had a station on this line. The line closed in 1959, but the canal (including the tunnel), is now being restored. Today the nearest station is Ledbury on the Cotswold Line.
Newent also contains the largest cul-de-sac in Europe, Foley Road.http://www.royalforestofdean.info/leadon-vale/newent.shtml
Newent is home to the National Birds of Prey Centre, located just east of the neighbouring village of Cliffords Mesne, a vineyard (The Three Choirs), and is at the centre of the Golden Triangle, so called because of the preponderance of daffodils in the surrounding area.
The town holds an onion fayre each September, at which there are competitions for growing onions and for eating onions.
Educational commissioners during the reign of Edward VI (1547–53) noted the lack of educational opportunities in Newent. Gloucestershire commissioners reported that Newent was a market town with over 500 inhabitants but "all the youth of a great distance therehence rudely brought up and in no manner of knowledge and learning, where were a place meet to ... erect a school for the better and more godly bringing up of the same youth".Joan Simon, Education and Society in Tudor England, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967, p.229. Newent is now served by three schools, all within the town. Glebe Primary School is for children aged 4 to 7, moving on to Picklenash Junior School until age 11. Newent Community School provides both secondary and tertiary education for ages 11 upwards.

[[Logarithmic timeline]]
CATEGORIES: Timelines, Orders of magnitude (time)

A logarithmic timeline is a timeline laid out according to a logarithmic scale.  This necessarily implies a zero point and an infinity point, neither of which can be displayed. The most natural zero point is the Big Bang, looking forward, but the most common is the ever-changing present, looking backward. (Also possible is a zero point in the present, looking forward to the infinite future.)
The idea of presenting history logarithmically goes back at least to 1932, when John B. Sparks copyrighted his "Histomap of Evolution". Around the same time it was also explored by the cyberneticist Heinz von Foerster, who used it to propose that memories naturally fade in an exponential manner. Logarithmic timelines have also been used in future studies to justify the idea of a technological singularity.
A logarithmic scale enables events throughout time to be presented accurately, but enables more events to be included closer to one end. Sparks explained this by stating:
Two examples of such timelines are shown below, while a more comprehensive version (similar to that of Sparks' "Histomap") can be found at Detailed logarithmic timeline.

[[Traction engine]]
CATEGORIES: Traction engines

A traction engine is a self-propelled steam engine used to move heavy loads on roads, plough ground or to provide power at a chosen location. The name derives from the Latin tractus, meaning 'drawn', since the prime function of any traction engine is to draw a load behind it. They are sometimes called road locomotives to distinguish them from railway locomotives – that is, steam engines that run on rails.
Traction engines tend to be large, robust and powerful, but heavy, slow, and have poor manoeuvrability. Nevertheless, they revolutionized agriculture and road haulage at a time when the only alternative prime mover was the draught horse.
They became popular in industrialised countries from around 1850, when the first self-propelled portable steam engines for agricultural use were developed. Production continued well into the early part of the 20th century, when competition from internal combustion engine–powered tractors saw them fall out of favour, although some continued in commercial use in the UK into the 1950s and later. All types of traction engines have now been superseded, in commercial use. However, several thousand examples have been preserved worldwide, many in working order. Steam fairs are held throughout the year in the UK, and in other countries, where visitors can experience working traction engines at close hand.
Traction engines were cumbersome and ill-suited to crossing soft or heavy ground, so their agricultural use was usually either "on the belt" – powering farm machinery by means of a continuous leather belt driven by the flywheel – or in pairs, dragging an implement on a cable from one side of a field to another. However, where soil conditions permitted, direct hauling of implements ("off the drawbar") was preferred – in the US, this led to the divergent development of the steam tractor.

CATEGORIES: Developmental biology

Mesenchyme is a type of tissue characterized by loosely associated cells that lack polarity and are surrounded by a large extracellular matrix. Mesenchymal cells are able to develop into the tissues of the lymphatic and circulatory systems, as well as connective tissues throughout the body, such as bone and cartilage. A sarcoma is a cancer of mesenchymal cells.[tpl]cite book |author=Strum, Judy M.; Gartner, Leslie P.; Hiatt, James L. |title=Cell biology and histology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages=83 |isbn=0-7817-8577-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Sadler | first = T.W. | title = Langman's Medical Embryology | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year = 2006 | pages = 68–70 | isbn = 0-7817-9485-4[/tpl]

A draft horse (US), draught horse (UK) or dray horse (from the Old English dragan meaning to draw or haul; compare Dutch dragen and German tragen meaning 'to carry'), less often called a work horse or heavy horse, is a large horse bred for hard heavy tasks such as ploughing and farm labor. There are a number of breeds, with varying characteristics but all share common traits of strength, patience, and a docile temperament which made them indispensable to generations of pre-industrial farmers.
Draft horses and draft crossbreds are versatile breeds used today for a multitude of purposes, including farming, draft horse showing, logging, recreation, and other uses. They are also commonly used for crossbreeding, especially to light riding breeds such as the Thoroughbred for the purpose of creating sport horses.  While most draft horses are used for driving, they can be ridden and some of the lighter draft breeds are capable performers under saddle.

Doppler temperature is the minimum temperature achievable with Doppler cooling, one of the methods of laser cooling.
The term Doppler arises from the fact that the Doppler effect, which provides a velocity dependence of the absorption rate and thus the light force, is an essential ingredient of the Doppler cooling mechanism.
Temperatures well below the Doppler limit have been achieved with various laser cooling methods, including Sisyphus cooling, which allows to approach the lower so-called recoil limit.

CATEGORIES: Biochemistry methods, Biomolecules, Receptors

A radioligand is a radioactive biochemical substance (in particular, a ligand) that is used for diagnosis or for research-oriented study of the receptor systems of the body.
In a neuroimaging application the radioligand is injected into the pertinent tissue, or infused into the bloodstream. 
It binds to its receptor.
When the radioactive isotope in the ligand decays it can be measured by positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In in vivo systems it is often used to quantify the binding of a test molecule to the binding site of radio ligand. The higher the affinity of the molecule the more radio ligand is displaced from the binding site and the increasing radioactive decay can be measured by scintillography. This assay is commonly used to calculate binding constant of molecules to receptors.
The transport of the radioligand is described by receptor kinetics.

[[Installation testing]]

CATEGORIES: Software testing

Installation testing is a kind of quality assurance work in the software industry that focuses on what customers will need to do to install and set up the new software successfully.  The testing process may involve full, partial or upgrades install/uninstall processes.
This testing is typically done by the software testing engineer in conjunction with the configuration manager. Implementation testing is usually defined as testing which places a compiled version of code into the testing or pre-production environment, from which it may or may not progress into production. This generally takes place outside of the software development environment to limit code corruption from other future or past releases (or from the use of the wrong version of dependencies such as shared libraries) which may reside on the development environment. 
The simplest installation approach is to run an install program, sometimes called package software.  This package software typically uses a setup program which acts as a multi-configuration wrapper and which may allow the software to be installed on a variety of machine and/or operating environments. Every possible configuration should receive an appropriate level of testing so that it can be released to customers with confidence.
In distributed systems, particularly where software is to be released into an already live target environment (such as an operational website) installation (or software deployment as it is sometimes called) can involve database schema changes as well as the installation of new software. Deployment plans in such circumstances may include back-out procedures whose use is intended to roll the target environment back if the deployment is unsuccessful. Ideally, the deployment plan itself should be tested in an environment that is a replica of the live environment. A factor that can increase the organizational requirements of such an exercise is the need to synchronize the data in the test deployment environment with that in the live environment with minimum disruption to live operation. This type of implementation may include testing of the processes which take place during the installation or upgrade of a multi-tier application. This type of testing is commonly compared to a dress rehearsal or may even be called a “dry run”.

Welthauptstadt Germania ("World Capital Germania") refers to the projected renewal of the German capital Berlin during the Nazi period, part of Adolf Hitler's vision for the future of Germany after the planned victory in World War II. Albert Speer, the "first architect of the Third Reich", produced many of the plans for the rebuilt city in his capacity as overseer of the project, only a small portion of which was realized between the years 1937–1943 when construction took place.
Some projects, such as the creation of a great East-West city axis, which included broadening Charlottenburger Chaussee (today Straße des 17. Juni) and placing the Berlin victory column in the centre, far away from the Reichstag, where it originally stood, were successfully completed. Others, however, such as the creation of the Große Halle (Great Hall), had to be shelved owing to the beginning of war. A great number of the old buildings in many of the planned construction areas were, however, demolished before the war and eventually defeat stopped the plans.

He pitched from 1967-1986 for four different teams in his career, but is noted primarily for his time with the New York Mets. During a 20-year career, Seaver compiled 311 wins, 3,640 strikeouts, 61 shutouts and a 2.86 earned run average. In [tpl]By|1992[/tpl], he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the highest percentage ever recorded (98.84%), and has the only plaque at Cooperstown wearing a New York Mets hat. As of 2010, Tom Seaver and Gil Hodges (played for the Mets in 1962-63) are the only Met players to have their jersey numbers retired by the team (Gil Hodges' number was retired as a manager even though he also played for the Mets).
He won the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 1967, and three NL Cy Young Awards as the league's best pitcher. Seaver is the Mets' all-time leader in wins, and is considered by many baseball experts as one of the best starting pitchers in the history of baseball.

[[Image viewer]]

CATEGORIES: Graphics software, Image viewers

An image viewer or image browser is a computer program that can display stored graphical images; it can often handle various graphics file formats. Such software usually renders the image according to properties of the display such as color depth, display resolution, and color profile.
Although one may use a full-featured bitmap graphics editor (such as Photoshop or the GIMP or the StylePix) as an image viewer, these have many editing functionalities which are not needed for just viewing images, and therefore usually start rather slowly. Also, most viewers have functionalities that editors usually lack, such as stepping through all the images in a directory (possibly as a slideshow).
Image viewers give maximal flexibility to the user by providing a direct view of the directory structure available on a hard disk.  Most image viewers do not provide any kind of automatic organization of pictures and therefore the burden remains on the user to create and maintain their folder structure (using tag- or folder-based methods). However, some image viewers also have features for organizing images, especially an image database, and hence can also be used as image organizers.
Some image viewers, such as Windows Photo Viewer that comes with Windows operating systems, change a JPEG image if it is rotated, resulting in loss of image quality; others offer lossless rotation.

[[Camboinhas]]

CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods of Niterói

Camboinhas is one of the 48 neighborhoods into which the city of Niterói, in Brazil, is divided.
The name originated in a marine accident in the 1950s.  In that decade, a ship called Camboinhas grounded on the beach. A Brazilian Navy corvette named "Angostura" was sent to save the ship, but grounded during her attempts to tow "Camboinhas" out of the beach. The Navy then abandoned their attempts to salvage the "Camboinhas" and concentrated all efforts on saving the "Angostura", which they eventually succeeded in doing. Today, the remains of the hull of the Camboinhas can be seen on the beach, during low tide.
The neighborhood has shores on both the Itaipu Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean and was inhabited primarily by fishermen until 1978, when a company named Veplan started lotting the land for the real estate market.  Between the years of 1980 and 1991, the place experienced a population growth rate of 14.84% per year, leading the city's statistics in that category.  As a result, in 1991 it had a population of 926, which equals 0.21% of the total population of the municipality.
On the Atlantic shore, the place is marked by typical vegetation of the region, with sand dunes and restinga vegetation.
In terms of occupation, the area is dominated by middle and upper-class family residences.  95.51% of the houses have plumbing.
Tourism: the views of Rio de Janeiro from this beach are some of the most beautiful around. It's a wonderful place to spend the day.  It's about a 1 hr drive from Rio. The beach is not very crowded at all during the week, it's very swimmable and walkable, there are kiosks/little restaurants right on the beach serving snacks, full meals (great seafood) and cold drinks.  It's worth staying for the gorgeous sunsets.

Faiz Ahmad Faiz  (Punjabi, [tpl]lang-ur|[tpl]Nastaliq|فیض احمد فیض [/tpl][/tpl], born 13 February 1911 – 20 November 1984) MBE, NI,Lenin Peace Prize was an influential left-wing intellectual, revolutionary poet, and one of the most famous poets of Urdu. He also wrote poems in Punjabi http://sidhusaaheb.blogspot.de/2010/08/punjabi-poetry-by-faiz.html language as well.  A notable member of the Progressive Writers' Movement (PWM), Faiz was an avowed Marxist.  Listed four times for the Nobel Prize in poetry, he received the Lenin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union in 1962. Despite being repeatedly accused of atheism by the political and military establishment, Faiz's poetry suggested a more nuanced relationship with religion in general and with Islam in particular.  He was, in fact, greatly inspired by both secular poetry and South Asia's Sufi traditions. His popular ghazal Hum Dekhenge is an example of how he fused these interests.
Faiz was controversially named and linked by Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan's government for hatching the conspiracy (see Rawalpindi conspiracy case) against Liaquat Ali Khan's government, along with a left-wing military sponsor Major-General Akbar Khan. Having been arrested by Military police, Faiz among others received a maximum sentence by JAG branch, although his sentence was commuted after the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan in 1951.
He remained extremely influential in Pakistan and his work continues to influence the country's literature and arts. Faiz was publicly honored by the Pakistan Government after his literary work was publicly endorsed and posthumously honored him with nation's highest civil award, Nishan-e-Imtiaz, in 1990.

The Battle of Philippi—also known mockingly as "The Philippi Races"—was fought on June 3, 1861, in and around Philippi, Virginia (now West Virginia) as part of the Western Virginia Campaign of the American Civil War. It was the first organized land action in the war (the impromptu Battle of Fairfax Court House took place two days earlier), but is often treated dismissively as a skirmish rather than a significant battle.Eicher, Longest Night, p. 75, wrote "Although this minor skirmish was glorified in the press ... it had little significance." The National Park Service battle description concludes, "Although a small affair, this was considered the first major land action in the Eastern Theater." The other contender for first battle in the East is Big Bethel, on June 10.

Monia Mazigh ([tpl]lang-ar|منية مازيغ[/tpl]) (born 1970) is a Canadian academic best known for her efforts to free her husband Maher Arar from a Syrian prison. A resident of Ottawa, Ontario, she was the New Democratic Party candidate for the riding of Ottawa South, a traditionally Liberal riding, in the 2004 federal election.
She was born and raised in Tunisia and emigrated to Canada in 1991, at the age of 21. Mazigh has a Ph.D. in financial economics from McGill University and speaks Arabic, English and French fluently. In 2000, she started working for the University of Ottawa as a research assistant and later as a French-language instructor. She has stated that until 2002, her goal was to become a professor instead of a politician.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.carleton.ca/jmc/cnews/22102004/n4.shtml| title=Monia Mazigh finds political home with federal NDP| last=Tropea |first=Martha| date=22 October 2004| work=Capital News Online| publisher=Carleton University| accessdate=27 February 2011[/tpl]
Mazigh first entered the public spotlight when her husband was deported to Syria in 2002 by the US government, on suspicion of terrorist links. He was tortured and held without charge for over a year before being returned to Canada. Mazigh joined with a number of human rights groups to press the government for his release. She appeared frequently in the media and was widely respected for her tireless efforts. Of her willingness to speak out, she has said that she was never afraid: "I had lost my life. I didn't have more to lose."http://www.kamloopsthisweek.com/portals-code/list.cgi?paper=15&cat=23&id=815992&more=
She was courted by the Liberal Party, but chose to stand as a candidate for the NDP. Mazigh had reportedly grown personally close with NDP foreign affairs critic, and former federal leader, Alexa McDonough, and she perceived the NDP as having been more emphatic than the other parties in calling for her husband's release. During a leaders' debate, NDP leader Jack Layton said that the party was proud to have her as a candidate. However, Mazigh's candidacy was unusual in that Mazigh personally does not support same-sex marriage; had she been elected she would have been the only NDP MP, alongside Desmond McGrath, NDP candidate in the riding of Random-Burin-St. George's in Newfoundland and Labrador, to oppose same-sex marriage by abstaining from a vote. While campaigning Mazigh said that she would abstain if Parliament was ever called to vote on the issue because of her reluctance to vote against a human rights issue.Ottawa Citizen. "Ottawa South candidates unlikely allies on gay marriage".  June 5, 2004.  pg. B.1 She also joined several individuals and groups in criticizing the NDP's more friendly attitude to Israel following the departure of Svend Robinson from the role of foreign affairs critic.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.canpalnet-ottawa.org/letteropen.html| title=Open letter to Jack Layton on NDP/Middle East| last=Arif| first=Raza| date=22 September 2004| publisher=Canpalnet Ottawa| accessdate=27 February 2011[/tpl]
She ran against but lost to Liberal candidate David McGuinty, the brother of Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. Despite finishing third, her 8,080 votes were the highest the NDP has ever won in Ottawa South federally or provincially until Henri Sader won 8,138 votes in 2006.
After running in the election, she worked for a while as a policy researcher at NDP headquarters in Ottawa. Some of her areas of expertise included economics (such as budget issues) and child care. She was employed as a professor of finance, at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbiahttp://www.kamloopsnews.ca for about one year until spring 2007.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.tru.ca/news/06storiesdec/mazigh.html| title=Monia Mazigh: Quest for Justice| last=Jenks| first=Lori| date=n.d.| work=The Digital Times| publisher=Thompson Rivers University| accessdate=27 February 2011[/tpl] She currently resides in Ottawa.

It is a dark green, gelatinous, thixotropic substance used to clean grease, oil, printer's ink, or general persistent, hydrophobic dirt from the skin. Swarfega is used by working a small amount into dry skin, then wiping or rinsing off. As with other such cleaners, it can be more effective than soap or other common cleansing products at removing such dirt; Swarfega became virtually ubiquitous in environments where this kind of dirt is common, such as garages and machine shops.

[[Image:John Bauer-Tyr and Fenrir.jpg|right|240px|thumb|According to the Edda, Fenrisulfr bites off the
hand of Týr (John Bauer, 1911)]]
In J. R. R. Tolkien's mythology of Middle-earth, Carcharoth (pronounced [tpl]IPA-art|ˈkarxarɔθ|[/tpl]), Sindarin for "The Red Maw", was the greatest werewolf that had ever lived. He was also called Anfauglir (Jaws of Thirst; IPA: [tpl]IPA|anˈfaʊɡlir[/tpl]). He was bred with the specific goal of killing Huan, the hound of Valinor, a goal in which he succeeded (Morgoth, as well as his most powerful servant Sauron, was aware of the prophecies regarding Huan's death and set out to make the prophecy come true).
Born of the foul breed of the Wolves of Angband and fed by Morgoth's own hand with Elvish and man-flesh in which Morgoth deliberately infused his own powers, Carcharoth tirelessly guarded Morgoth's Dark Throne in Angband.
He became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril when Beren and Lúthien had to pass him on their way into Angband. Lúthien enchanted him with her magic, but on their way out Carcharoth attacked before Lúthien could enthral him again. Beren held out the captured Silmaril in an attempt to stay the beast, but Carcharoth bit off Beren's hand and swallowed it together with the Silmaril.
The Silmaril burned away Carcharoth's insides, and he became crazed with pain. A terror to Elves, Men and Orcs alike, he passed south through Beleriand until he arrived in Doriath. There Beren Erchamion, Elu Thingol, Beleg Cúthalion and Mablung joined with Huan the Hound to hunt the Wolf.
Carcharoth was killed by Huan, but Huan died soon afterwards from his wounds. When Mablung cut open the belly of Carcharoth, he found there the Silmaril with Beren's hand still around it, but when he touched the flesh it was swept away by a wind. Beren then died of his wound, but returned later after Lúthien's pleas to Mandos.

Foulness is an island on the east coast of Essex in England, which is separated from the mainland by narrow creeks. In the 2001 census, the usually resident population was 212, living in the settlements of Churchend and Courtsend, at the north end of the island. The island has a general store and post office. The George and Dragon pub in Churchend closed in 2007, while the church closed in May 2010.  
Foulness Island is predominantly farmland and is protected from the sea by a sea wall. The island's name is derived from the Old English for wild birds and promontory, and it is an internationally important site for migrating and breeding birds, including avocets. During the North Sea flood of 1953, almost the entire island was flooded, and two people died.
Prior to 1922, when the military road was built, the only access was across the Maplin Sands via the Broomway, a tidal path said to predate the Romans, or by boat. Although public rights of way exist, the island is run by QinetiQ on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, and access to the island is only permitted with a pass, obtainable from Shoeburyness. The island's visitor centre is opened to the public on the first Sunday in summer months, but permission must be sought to visit. Until 2007, members of the public could visit the island's pub by telephoning ahead; if they had not done so, access would be denied.

It is contested by 22 teams and organized by the Lega Serie B since July 2010, after the split of Lega Calcio that previously took care of both the Serie A and Serie B. Common nicknames for the league are campionato cadetto and cadetteria, as cadetto is the Italian for junior or cadet.
Serie B was composed of 20 teams until the 2002–03 season. It was enlarged to 24 teams for the 2003–04 season due to legal problems relating to Calcio Catania relegation. The league reverted to 22 teams for the 2004–05 season, while Serie A expanded from 18 to 20 teams.
During the regular season, each team plays 42 games – two games against every opponent. In Italian football, a true round-robin format is used. In the first half of the season, called andata, each team plays once against all its opponents, a total of 21 games.  In the second half of the season, called ritorno, each team will play the same teams in exactly the same order, the only difference being that a home game played in the first half will be an away game with that same team in the second half, and vice versa.
Since the 2006–07 season, the Serie B champion is awarded the cup Ali della Vittoria (Wings of Victory). The trophy is 63 cm high and weighs 5 kg.  Its structure represents the wings of the goddess Nike, the goddess of victory, holding a cup similar to an olympic flame.
Serie B matches are usually played on Saturday.  After one year where all games were played on Saturday, the league is again scheduling one game that is played on Friday called anticipo (the advanced game) and one game that is played on Monday called posticipo (the post-dated game).  The league also plays on several Tuesdays to fit in all 42 games.  The league also plays on Sunday if Serie A is off.

[[Charitas]]
CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods of Niterói

Charitas is one of the 48 neighborhoods in which the city of Niterói, in Brazil is divided.
The area was part of the Jesuitic Sesmaria, where the Jesuits built a cemetery and a church consecrated to Saint Francis Xavier.  The name of the neighborhood derives from the Latin word caritas, meaning charity, which is inscribed on the church's door.
In the 18th century, a landowner donated to the Saint Joseph Seminar, in Rio de Janeiro, the piece of land that came to be the Jurujuba Farm and upon which a mansion, known as Casarão (big house) was built.
In 1853, the Saint Isabel Naval Hospital was opened and originally run by the sanitarist Francisco de Paula Cândido, in whose honor the neighborhood was first named "Paula Cândido".  The hospital's function was to isolate the sick people that came with the ships that docked in Rio de Janeiro's harbor.  Later, the hospital was turned into a safe house to receive children that had been infected with tuberculosis known as Preventório, after which the local beach came to be known.
In the 1940s, an aeroclub was built in the area.  It still exists and can handle small, private planes and helicopter landings and take-offs.
The neighborhood's limits are: the waters of the Guanabara Bay, the neighborhood of Piratininga (at the Viração Hill) and the neighborhoods of Jurujuba and São Francisco (contiguous boundary).  Its territory is located in the São Francisco Ensenada, which is the land comprised between the Viração Hill and the shore.
The local population of approximately 3,854 (in 1991) represents 0.88% of Niterói's total population.  A small chanty town exists on the Preventório Hill.

Harry B. Helmsley (March 4, 1909 – January 4, 1997) was an American
businessman.  He built a company that became one of the biggest property holders in the United States. Part of his company's portfolio at one time included the Empire State Building, The Helmsley Palace, the Park Lane Hotel, the Helmsley Middletowne Hotel, the New York Helmsley Hotel (also known as the New York Harley), The Helmsley Windsor Hotel, the St. Moritz (now the Ritz-Carlton), the Carlton House hotels, the Harley Hotel chain and The Helmsley Building in New York City.
His wife, Leona Helmsley — notoriously called the "Queen of Mean" — was convicted in 1989 on federal charges of tax evasion in a celebrated trial.  Harry had been indicted along with Leona, but it was determined that he was too far ill physically to stand trial and too weak mentally to be capable of assisting his attorneys in his own defense, one of the legal standards which allows crimes to go unprosecuted on the grounds of mental defect of the defendant.
In 1980, Mr. Helmsley received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York."

São Francisco is one of the 48 neighborhoods in which the Brazilian city of Niterói is divided.
Its name derives from the church consecrated to Saint Francis Xavier (in Portuguese: São Francisco Xavier) and references to it can be found as early as the 17th century.  The São Francisco Ensenada, also known as "saco" de São Francisco" (roughly translated as São Francisco's "bag", on account of the Ensenada's shape), was an important source of fish for both the Indians and the Portuguese.
In the 19th century, an important road existed, connecting the neighborhood of Icaraí, across the Morro do Cavalão (Big Horse Hill), to Charitas and then across the Morro da Viração (Viração Hill) to Piratininga, on the Ocean shore (note that Icaraí, São Francisco and Charitas have their shores on the Guanabara Bay).
The population of approximately 9,620 (in 1991) represents 2.21% of Niterói's total population.  No slums exist in the neighborhood.
São Francisco is also the homeland of Marcelo Morcego and Rico Chilinque.
The São Francisco waterfront is famous for its concentration of bars, restaurants and night clubs, being the beating heart of Niterói's nightlife.

Gothmog is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium.  He appears briefly in The Return of the King, the third volume of The Lord of the Rings  as originally printed.
The only reference to Gothmog in The Lord of the Rings is one sentence in The Return of the King.[tpl]ME-ref|rotk|"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields"[/tpl]  He served in Sauron's army during the War of the Ring, as the lieutenant of Minas Morgul, second-in-command to the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the nine Nazgûl (Ringwraiths).  He took command of the forces of Morgul during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields after the Witch-king was slain by Éowyn and Merry.Foster, p. 117.
His fate is not described, although Tolkien writes almost all of the servants of Sauron that fought before the gates of Minas Tirith were killed. Tolkien writes nothing else about Gothmog — not even what race of beings he belonged to. In 1971, it was suggested in The Complete Guide to Middle-earth that he was possibly the second highest Ringwraith,Foster, p. 184. but in Unfinished Tales (first published posthumously in 1980), previously unpublished texts by Tolkien provided a different name for that character: Khamûl, "the Black Easterling".[tpl]ME-ref|UT|Index, entry for Khamûl[/tpl]
Gothmog shares his name with another of Tolkien's characters, Gothmog Lord of Balrogs, who is featured in The Silmarillion.

[[Punch line]]
CATEGORIES: Comedy, Storytelling

A punch line (or punchline) is the final part of a joke, comedy sketch, or profound statement, usually the word, sentence or exchange of sentences which is intended to be funny or to provoke laughter or thought from listeners. Few punchlines are inherently funny out of context, but when a comedian sets up the premise and builds up the audience's expectations, the punch line can function as the climactic part of the act.
Punch lines generally derive their humor from being unexpected. The classic stand-up punch line sound is a sting (erroneously called a rimshot) on drums.

[[Hexateuch]]
CATEGORIES: Biblical criticism, Hebrew Bible

The Hexateuch ("six scrolls") is the first six books of the Hebrew BibleHarris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. (the Torah or Pentateuch and the book of Joshua). 
The term Hexateuch came into scholarly use from the 1870s onwards mainly as the result of work carried out by Abraham Kuenen and Julius Wellhausen.[tpl]Cite NIE|year=1905|Hexateuch|author=Nathaniel Schmidt[/tpl] Following the work of Eichhorn, de Wette, Graf, Kuenen, Noldeke, Colenso and others, in his Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels Wellhausen proposed that Joshua represented part of the northern Yahwist source (c 950 BC), detached from  JE document by the Deuteronomist (c 650-621) and incorporated into the Deuteronomic history, with the books of Judges, Kings, and Samuel.
Reasons for this unity, in addition to the presumed presence of the other documentary traditions, are taken from comparisons of the thematic concerns that underlie the narrative surface of the texts. For instance, the Book of Joshua stresses the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua. Furthermore the theme of Joshua, the fulfillment of God's promise to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land, complements the thematic material of the Pentateuch, which had ended with the Israelites on the border of the Promised Land ready to enter.
The thesis that Joshua completes the Torah in a Hexateuch may be contrasted with the view of scholars following the older rabbinic tradition, as expressed by the compilers of the Jewish Encyclopedia (compiled between 1901 and 1906), that the Pentateuch is a complete work in itself.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl] The thesis may also be contrasted with the view put forward by Eduard Meyer (1855–1930) that there never was any Hexateuch per se, but that the Law, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings once formed one great historic work.

[[Liver transplantation]]

CATEGORIES: Accessory digestive gland surgery, Hepatology, Organ transplantation

Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is orthotopic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and hepatic tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.

The Confederation of the Rhine ([tpl]lang-de|Rheinbund[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|États confédérés du Rhin[/tpl], officially "Confederated States of the Rhine", but in practice Confédération du Rhin) was a confederation of client states of the First French Empire. It was formed initially from 16 German states by Napoleon after he defeated Austria and Russia in the Battle of Austerlitz. The Treaty of Pressburg, in effect, led to the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine. It lasted from 1806 to 1813.Hans A. Schmitt, "Germany Without Prussia: A Closer Look at the Confederation of the Rhine," German Studies Review (1983) 6#1 pp 9-39.
The members of the confederation were German princes (Fürsten) from the Holy Roman Empire. They were later joined by 19 others, all together ruling a total of over 15 million subjects providing a significant strategic advantage to the French Empire on its eastern front.  Prussia and Austria were not members.
Napoleon sought to consolidate the modernizing achievements of the revolution, but he wanted the soldiers and supplies these subject states could provide for his wars.  The most important accomplishments include the introduction of the Napoleon code, the establishment of religious toleration (especially for Jews), and the abolition of feudal rights.  It used a constitution written along French lines.  Napoleon required it to supply 63,000 troops to his army. The success of the Confederation depended on Napoleon's success in battle; it collapsed when he lost the battle of Leipzig in 1813.

Fort George (Gaelic: [tpl]lang|gd|Dùn Deòrsa[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|gd|An Gearastan[/tpl], meaning literally "the garrison"), is a large 18th century fortress near Ardersier, to the north-east of Inverness in the Highland council area of Scotland. It was built to pacify the Scottish Highlands in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745, replacing a Fort George in Inverness constructed after the 1715 Jacobite rising to control the area. The current fortress has never been attacked and has remained in continuous use as a garrison. 
The fortification is based on a Star design, it remains virtually unaltered and nowadays is open to visitors with exhibits and recreations showing use at different periods, while still serving as army barracks. Originally the depot of the Seaforth Highlanders and later the Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons), it was more recently home to the Royal Irish Regiment, and as of 2007, the new garrison of the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Brown sugar is a  sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color due to the presence of molasses. It is either an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content, or it is produced by the addition of molasses to refined white sugar (so-called Molasses Sugar).
Brown sugar contains from 3.5% molasses (light brown sugar) to 6.5% molasses (dark brown sugar) based on total volume.">[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.foodarts.com/news/classics/20964/roses-sugar-bible | title=Rose's Sugar Bible | last1=Levy Beranbaum | first1=Rose | date=April 2000 | accessdate=2013-04-06[/tpl][/ref] Based on total weight, regular brown sugar contains up to 10% molasses.[tpl]cite book |author=Paula I.

The product may undergo processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling. The addition of dyes and/or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products.
Particle size is variable but generally less than granulated white sugar. Products for industrial use (e.g., the industrial production of cakes) may be based on caster sugar which has crystals of approximately 0.35 mm.

[[Klingon starships]]

CATEGORIES: Klingon starship classes, Klingons, Star Trek ships

In the Star Trek franchise, the Klingon Empire makes use of several classes of starships. As the Klingons are portrayed as a warrior culture, driven by the pursuit of honor and glory, the Empire is shown to use warships almost exclusively. This contrasts with the exploration and research vessels used by Starfleet, the protagonists of the franchise. The first Klingon ship design used in The Original Series, the D7-class battlecruiser, was designed by Matt Jefferies to evoke a shape akin to that of a manta ray, providing a threatening and instantly recognizable form for viewers. The configuration of Jefferies's design featured a bulbous forward hull connected by a long boom to a wing-like main hull with the engine nacelles mounted on each wingtip. Though a variety of Klingon ships have appeared in Star Trek, their design generally conforms to this style. Most Klingon vessels were physically built as scale models, although later computer-generated imagery was used to create the models. In recent years, many of the original studio models have been sold at auctions.
All Klingon ships are equipped with some form of sublight engine, and most of these ships are equipped with superluminal propulsion technology called warp drive. Klingon vessels are usually depicted as being heavily armed, equipped with particle beam weapons called disruptors and photon torpedoes, an antimatter weapon, as primary offensive weaponry. Later Klingon ships utilize cloaking devices. For The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine, Klingon ships were designed by Rick Sternbach to reflect technology exchanges as a result of an alliance between the Klingons and Starfleet. In the prequel television series Enterprise, Klingon ships are designed to appear more primitive than those chronologically later in the franchise. The interior of Klingon vessels is very utilitarian in nature: this is intended to mimic an old submarine. Klingon ship names are usually preceded by the prefix "IKS", an abbreviation for "Imperial Klingon Starship".

Freddy Got Fingered is a 2001 American comedy film directed, co-written by and starring Tom Green. The film follows Green as Gordon "Gord" Brody, a 28-year-old slacker who wishes to become a professional cartoonist. The film's plot resembles Green's struggles as a young man trying to get his TV series picked up, which would later become the popular MTV show The Tom Green Show.
The film was critically panned at the time of its release, many considering it one of the worst films of all time. It won 5 Golden Raspberry Awards out of 8 nominations, as well as a Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Worst Picture. The film received a cult following, and was also met with more positive praise over time, most notably from The New York Times, Metacritic, IFC.com and Splitsider. Despite performing poorly at the box office, the film became a financial success by selling millions of copies on DVD.

Sir Harold Mario Mitchell Acton CBE (5 July 1904 – 27 February 1994) was a British writer, scholar and dilettante perhaps most famous for being wrongly believed to have inspired (in whole) the character of "Anthony Blanche" in Evelyn Waugh's novel Brideshead Revisited (1945). Waugh himself wrote, "The characters in my novels often wrongly identified with Harold Acton were to a great extent drawn from Brian Howard".  That being said, we must also note, that in a letter to Lord Baldwin, an elucidating Waugh reveals, "There is an aesthetic bugger who sometimes turns up in my novels under various names -- that was 2/3 Brian Howard and 1/3 Harold Acton. People think it was all Harold, who is a much sweeter and saner man Howard."[tpl]cite book |last=Waugh |first=Evelyn |coauthors=Edited by Mark Amory |year=1980 |title=The Letters of Evelyn Waugh |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |isbn=1-85799-245-8 |page= 505[/tpl] It would seem, that Waugh, like many other writers, peopled his novels with composite characters based upon individuals he personally knew and that while neither Howard nor Acton can be totally identified on a one-to-one basis with any particular character, neither can their influence, in large part or small measure, be completely ignored.

Americana is a municipality (município) located in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. As of 2006, its population was 203,845.
The original settlement developed around the local railway station, founded in 1875, and the development of a cotton weaving factory in a nearby farm.
After 1866, several Confederate refugees from the American Civil War settled in the region. Following the Civil War, slavery was abolished in the United States. In Brazil, however, slavery was still legal, making it a particularly attractive location to former Confederates, among whom was a former member of the state senate of Alabama, William Hutchinson Norris.
Heavy Italian immigration at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth reduced the proportion of residents of Confederado descent to a mere ten percent or so of the current population, and only about a dozen English-speaking families remain in the area.[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Around three hundred of the Confederados are members of the Fraternidade Descendência Americana (Fraternity of American Descendants). They meet quarterly at the Campo Cemetery.[tpl]cite web| last=Gage|first=Leighton| title=Brazilian Confederacy |url=http://sleuthsayers.blogspot.com/2012/01/brazilian-confederacy.html |publisher=Sleuthsayers| accessdate=18 January 2012| location=São Paulo, Brasil| date=8 January 2012[/tpl]
The city was known as Vila dos Americanos ("Village of the Americans") until 1904, when it belonged to the city of Santa Bárbara d'Oeste. It became a district in 1924 and a municipality in 1953.
Americana has several museums and tourist attractions, including the Pedagogic Historical Museum and the Contemporary Art Museum.
Rio Branco Esporte Clube, founded in 1913, is the football (soccer) club of the city. The team plays their home matches at Estádio Décio Vitta, which has a maximum capacity of 15,000 people.

Bad Homburg vor der Höhe is the district town of the Hochtaunuskreis, Hesse, Germany, on the southern slope of the Taunus, bordering among others Frankfurt am Main and Oberursel. The town's formal name is Bad Homburg vor der Höhe (translated as "Bad Homburg in front of the height") to distinguish it from other places of the same name, abbreviated as Bad Homburg v. d. Höhe.
The town is best known for its medically used mineral waters and spa (hence the prefix Bad, "bath"), and for its casino.
Today, Bad Homburg is again one of the wealthiest towns in Germany, in part thanks to its vicinity near Frankfurt, as many of the directors and employees of the Frankfurt banks live in Bad Homburg. (The Hochtaunuskreis and the Landkreis Starnberg regularly compete for the title of the wealthiest district in Germany.)

Edward Leon Sciaky (April 2, 1948 – January 29, 2004) was a disc jockey in Philadelphia.
He was born in New York City and raised in Philadelphia, where he graduated from Central High School, and then from Temple University where he majored in mathematics. Sciaky (pronounced SHOCK-ee) became known for promoting new talent, helping  establish the careers of scores of artists, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, David Bowie, Janis Ian, and Yes.Ed Sciaky, a Broadcast Pioneer
He was one of the first FM disc jockeys who thrived when given the chance to choose their own music and play music other than pop hits. Frequently, he would play lesser known songs that had personal meaning for himself or listeners. He was a good friend to many musicians who enjoyed his intelligent interviews and his knowledge of rock-n-roll. One of the biggest stars he was a part of was Billy Joel. Billy, 23, had just released his Cold Spring Harbor album and was looking for promotion for his album. He was featured on a Sigma Sound broadcast with Sciaky.
His shows would not only entertain listeners, but educate them, as well. Ed enjoyed being a disc jockey and he loved music. He would even talk to listeners if they called to ask questions about obscure artists or songs. It was this kind of personal touch that made him one of the most popular and respected FM disc jockeys of his time.
Sciaky's broadcasting career, all in the Philadelphia area, covered WRTI, WHAT, WXUR (in Media; unrelated to the modern WXUR), WDAS, WMMR, WIOQ, WYSP, WMMR (again), and finally WMGK.
Sciaky, a diabetic, was on kidney dialysis, and his right foot had been amputated in December 2002 as a result of complications from diabetes. While preparing to return home from New York after spending a weekend seeing Broadway shows with his wife, he died at Manhattan's Penn Station when he collapsed on the sidewalk from a massive heart attack. He was 55.
He left behind wife, Judy, and daughter, Monica.
The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia http://www.broadcastpioneers.com posthumously inducted Sciaky into their Hall of Fame in 2005.

Mughal-e-Azam (The Emperor of the Mughals) is a 1960 Indian film directed by K. Asif and produced by Shapoorji Pallonji. Starring Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, and Durga Khote, the historical epic follows the love affair between Mughal Prince Salim (who went on to become Emperor Jahangir) and Anarkali, a court dancer. Salim's father, Emperor Akbar, disapproves of the relationship, which leads to a war between father and son.
The development of Mughal-e-Azam began in 1944, when Asif read a play set in the reign of Emperor Akbar (1556–1605). Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty. Before its principal photography began in the early 1950s the project had lost a financier and undergone a complete change of cast. Mughal-e-Azam cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period. The soundtrack, inspired by Indian classical and folk music, comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singers including Lata Mangeshkar and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. It is often cited as one of the finest soundtracks in Bollywood cinematic history.
Mughal-e-Azam had the widest release of any Indian film up to that time and patrons often queued all day for tickets. Released on 5 August 1960 it broke box office records in India, and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time, a distinction it held for 15 years. The accolades awarded to the film include one National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards. Mughal-e-Azam was the first black-and-white Hindi film to be digitally coloured, and the first in any language to be given a theatrical re-release. The colour version, released in November 2004, was a commercial success.
The film is widely considered a milestone of its genre, earning praise from critics for its grandeur and attention to detail. Film scholars have welcomed its portrayal of enduring themes, but question its historical accuracy.

[[Semi-locally simply connected]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic topology, Homotopy theory, Properties of topological spaces

In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, the phrase semi-locally simply connected refers to a certain local connectedness condition that arises in the theory of covering spaces.  Roughly speaking, a topological space X is semi-locally simply connected if there is a lower bound on the sizes of the “holes” in X.  This condition is necessary for most of the theory of covering spaces, including the existence of a universal cover and the Galois correspondence between covering spaces and subgroups of the fundamental group.
Most “nice” spaces such as manifolds and CW complexes are semi-locally simply connected, and topological spaces that do not satisfy this condition are considered somewhat pathological.  The standard example of a non-semi-locally simply connected space is the Hawaiian earring.

Railroad police or Railway police (called Bahnpolizei in Germany, Austria and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland) are different from one country to another. Their roles in some countries are not different from that of any other police agency, while in others they are more related to a type of security police. They are all commonly responsible for the protection of railroad (or railway) vast networks of properties, facilities and personnel as well as public rail transit systems. Some are given extensive additional authority where other jurisdictions are more restricted. 
In the United States and Canada, all railroad police are employed by the major Class I railroads, as well as some smaller ones. In other countries, this work is typically done by territorial police forces rather than specialized agencies. In Great Britain, railways fall under the jurisdiction of the British Transport Police, a nation-wide transit police force that is responsible for policing all railways and some public transit systems.

[[Transit police]]

CATEGORIES: Law enforcement units, Public transport, Transit police departments

Transit police are a specialized police agency or unit employed by a common carrier, which could be a transit district, railroad, bus line, other transport carrier, or the state. Their mandate is to prevent and investigate crimes committed against the carrier or by or against passengers or other customers of the carrier, or those committed on the carrier's property.
A transit police force may consist of officers employed directly by a transit system, such as the Amtrak Police, or it may exist as a specialized unit of a local police force, such as the Transit Police Services Bureau of the Orange County, California Sheriff's Department, which serves the Orange County Transportation Authority or South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Servicehttp://www.gvtaps.bc.ca which serves the transit system of southern British Columbia, Canada.
Where the term "transit police" is used for the police working for a railroad, it usually refers to a railroad providing urban mass transit (such as a city elevated system or subway) as opposed to long-distance rail carriage. Police who work either for a private non-passenger railroad or long-haul rail carrier are usually referred to as "railroad police" or "railway police". In Britain, most of the rail system, including the London Underground, is policed by a national transport police agency, the British Transport Police. Some transit police departments have full policing powers, such as BART Police, SEPTA Transit Police, Metro Transit Police Department, Utah Transit Authority Police Department or MBTA Transit Police, while in other areas, they have limited powers and are classed as special police or special constables with limited powers.
Some of the crimes transit police and railroad police investigate include trespassing on the right-of-way of a railroad, assaults against passengers, tagging of graffiti on railroad rolling stock and buses or bus stops, pickpocketing, ticket fraud, robbery and theft of personal belongings, baggage or freight, and drug dealing at transit stations.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 (with the abolition of West Suffolk) by the merger of the Borough of Bury St Edmunds, Haverhill Urban District, Clare Rural District and Thingoe Rural District.
Until March 2009 its main offices were in Bury St Edmunds (Angel Hill and Western Way). Thereafter a purpose built complex, West Suffolk House housed both St Edmundsbury and Suffolk County Council staff.St Edmundsbury website
In 2008 the Council submitted a proposal to the Boundary Commission which would see it as central to a new West Suffolk unitary council.St Edmundsbury website Despite the considerable energies used to promote this conceptThey work for you.com the proposal was rejected and no unitary scheme for Suffolk was adopted.

[[Membrane keyboard]]

CATEGORIES: Computer keyboards

A membrane keyboard is a computer keyboard whose "keys" are not separate, moving parts, as with the majority of other keyboards, but rather are pressure pads that have only outlines and symbols printed on a flat, flexible surface. Very little, if any, tactile feedback is felt when using such a keyboard, and error-free blind typing is difficult.
Membrane keyboards, which work by electrical contact between the keyboard surface and the underlying circuits when keytop areas are pressed, were used with some early 1980s home computers, and have been much used in consumer electronics devices. The keyboards are very inexpensive to mass-produce, and are more resistant against dirt and liquids than most other keyboards, but due to the low or non-existent amount of tactile feedback provided, most people have difficulty typing with them, especially when large numbers of characters need to be typed. Chiclet keyboards were a slight improvement, at least allowing individual keys to be felt to some extent.
Aside from early hobbyist/kit/home computers and some video game consoles, membrane-based QWERTY keyboards are used in some industrial computer systems, and are also found as portable, even "rollable-collapsible" designs for PDAs and other pocket computing devices. Smaller, specialised membrane keyboards, typically numeric-and-a-few-control-keys only, have been used in access control systems (for buildings and restricted areas), simple handheld calculators, domestic remote control keypads, microwave ovens, and other similar devices where the amount of typing is relatively small or infrequent, such as cell phones.
Modern PC keyboards are essentially a membrane keyboard mechanism covered with an array of dome switches which give positive tactile feedback.

The Archdiocese of America, better known as the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, is a jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.  It was formally constituted in 1922 and has had seven incumbents.  The Archdiocese currently covers the United States and one parish in the Bahamas, and is mostly Greek-American in composition and culture.
The following individuals have held the office of Archbishop of America:
The Diocese of the Aleutians and North America was a pan-ethnic and missionary jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Russian Orthodox Church from 1900 to 1922.  (Before this period it was known as the "Diocese of the Aleutians and Alaska" from 1870 to 1900; before that, it was part of the Diocese of Kamchatka, Russia, from 1840 to 1870, and before that, of the Diocese of Irkutsk, Russia.  From the 1920s until 1970 it was the "Metropolia of All America and Canada" the "Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America", and since 1970 it has also been known as "The Orthodox Church in America," covering the United States, Canada, Mexico, and two parishes in Australia.)  From 1905 to 1922, its incumbents held the title of Archbishop:
Since 1922 its incumbents and primates have held the title of Metropolitan of All America and Canada.  Today it is majority-Russian in ecclesiastical heritage, but with significant Romanian, Albanian, Bulgarian, and Mexican (in Mexico) jurisdictions and at least one Arab parish - all largely English- (or Spanish-)speaking - as well as increasing numbers of transfers from other Orthodox jurisdictions, and converts to Orthodoxy.
The Russian Exarchate of North America was another jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church under its Patriarchate of Moscow from 1933 to 1970.  While most of its bishops were titled Metropolitans of varying Sees, the final one was
Moscow was permitted to replace this Exarchate, and a diocese in Canada, with a non-diocesan patriarchal vicariate in each country, the United States and Canada, when it and the Metropolia were reconciled, and Moscow recognized the Metropolia's autocephaly, in 1970.  These vicariates, the "Russian Orthodox Church in the USA" and in Canada, are commonly referred to as the "Patriarchal Parishes."

Watkins Glen International (nicknamed "The Glen") is an automobile race track located near Watkins Glen, New York, at the southern tip of Seneca Lake. The sports car racing facility is owned by International Speedway Corporation. It was long known around the world as the home of the United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961–1980), but since 1948 the site has been home to road racing of nearly every class, including Formula One, the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, and the IndyCar Series. Initially, public roads in the village were used for the race course. In 1956 a permanent circuit for the race was built. In 1968 the race was extended to six hours, becoming, the Six Hours of Watkins Glen. The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, although a chicane was installed at the uphill Esses in 1975 to slow cars through these corners, where there was a fatality during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. The chicane was removed in 1985, but another chicane called the "Inner Loop" was installed in 1992 after a fatal accident during the previous year's NASCAR Winston Cup event. The circuit is known as the Mecca of North American road racing and is a very popular venue among fans and drivers.
The circuit also has been the site of two concerts: the 1973 Summer Jam, featuring The Allman Brothers Band, The Grateful Dead and The Band and attended by 600,000 fans,[tpl]cite book|last=Santelli|first=Robert|title=Aquarius Rising|year=1980|publisher=Dell|location=New York|isbn=978-0-440-50956-1[/tpl], cited in [tpl]cite web|last=Strycharz|first=Robb|title=Watkins Glen "Summer Jam" Archive|url=http://www.chronos-historical.org/rockfest/articles/WG1.html|work=Chronos|accessdate=2 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60eFD9hTt|archivedate=2 August 2011|deadurl=no[/tpl]  and Phish's Super Ball IX in 2011.

The Niagara campaign occurred in 1814 and was the final campaign launched by the United States to invade Canada during the War of 1812.  
The American forces, commanded by General Jacob Brown and General Winfield Scott, began the campaign with the Capture of Fort Erie on the Niagara Peninsula.  
Next, they decisively defeated the British at the Battle of Chippawa.
At the Battle of Lundy's Lane, both sides claimed victory, but because U.S. forces had suffered so many casualties, they pulled back to Fort Erie.  
Following their return to the fort, the British, under Gordon Drummond, attempted to capture the fort and the Siege of Fort Erie followed.  
The Americans were able to hold out, and the British eventually lifted the siege after suffering severe losses.  After a small engagement at Cook's Mills, American forces, commanded by General George Izard, abandoned Fort Erie and returned to the U.S. territory.

"D'oh!" ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|oʊ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|DOH|'[/tpl]) is a catchphrase used by the fictional character Homer Simpson, from the long-running American animated sitcom The Simpsons (1989–present). It is typically used when Homer injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. All his prominent blood relations—son Bart, daughters Lisa and Maggie, his father, his mother and half-brother—have also been heard to use it themselves in similar circumstances. On a few occasions Homer's wife Marge and even non-related characters such as Mr. Burns and Krusty the Clown have also used this phrase.
In 2006, "d'oh!" was listed as number six on TV Land's list of the 100 greatest television catchphrases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-11-28-catchprase-list_x.htm|title=Dyn-O-Mite!

It is the largest prison transport network in the world.[tpl]citation |title=Relocating Prisoners |last=Graves |first=Lucas |journal=Wired |date=June 2010 |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=148–149|url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/process_prisoners/[/tpl]  Though primarily used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, JPATS also assists military and state law enforcement.
The agency is managed by the United States Marshals Service out of the JPATS headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri.  JPATS was formed in 1995 from the merger of the Marshals Service air fleet with that of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  JPATS completes over 350,000 prisoner/alien movements per year.http://www.usmarshals.gov/jpats/  Air fleet operations are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with hubs in Anchorage, Alaska; Mesa, Arizona; Alexandria, Louisiana; and the Virgin Islands. Additionally, the Federal Transfer Center at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport was built especially to facilitate prisoner transport on JPATS. 
Usually, the airline employs Boeing 727 or McDonnell-Douglas MD-83 aircraft to transport convicts and illegal residents of the United States for extradition.  Smaller jets and turboprops are also used to transport individual prisoners who are considered particularly dangerous.
According to the Boeing Jetliner Databook, JPATS operates four Boeing 727s. JPATS also operates an additional four McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft.
JPATS aircraft use the ICAO designator DOJ with the callsign JUSTICE.
Immediately after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all civilian air service, JPATS was the only non-military air service allowed to continue flying in U.S. airspace.

[[Designated marksman]]

CATEGORIES: Infantry, Combat occupations, Sniper warfare, Military snipers, Marksmanship

The designated marksman (DM) or squad designated marksman (SDM) is a military marksman role in an infantry squad. The term sniper was used in Soviet doctrine although the soldiers using the Dragunov SVD were the first to use a specifically designed designated marksman's rifle. The analogous role in the Israeli army is sharpshooter.  
The DM's role is to supply rapid accurate fire on enemy targets at ranges up to [tpl]convert|500|m|yd|sp=us[/tpl] with a rifle capable of semi-automatic fire called a designated marksman rifle equipped with a telescopic sight. Like snipers, DMs are trained in quick and precise shooting, but unlike the more specialized "true" sniper, they are also attached to an infantry fireteam and intended to lay down accurate rapid fire at valuable targets as needed, thus extending the reach of the Fireteam.

Need for Speed (NFS) is a series of racing video games published by Electronic Arts (EA) and developed by several studios including the Canadian company EA Black Box and the British company Criterion Games.
The series released its first title, The Need for Speed in 1994. Initially, it was designed exclusively for use on fifth generation video game consoles, but later on was reworked to be able to be used on all seventh generation consoles by 2008. All members of the series consist of racing cars on various tracks, with some titles including police pursuits in races. Since Need for Speed: Underground, the series has integrated car body customization into gameplay.
Need for Speed is the most successful racing video game series in the world, and one of the most successful video game franchises of all time. As of October 2009, over 140 million copies of games in the series have been sold.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://variety.com/2013/digital/games/ford-races-to-need-for-speed-1200494284/ |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2013-06-10 |date=2013-06-10 |title=Ford's Mustang Races to ‘Need for Speed’[/tpl]

Axiomatic semantics is an approach based on mathematical logic to proving the correctness of computer programs. It is closely related to Hoare logic. 
Axiomatic semantics define the meaning of a command in a program by describing its effect on assertions about the program state. The assertions are logical statements - predicates with variables, where the variables define the state of the program.

[[Official scorer]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball occupations

In the game of baseball, the official scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, all of which are included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.
Newspaper writers initially performed this function in the early days of Major League Baseball (MLB). As the importance of baseball player statistics increased, teams began to pressure writer-scorers for favorable scoring decisions for their players in games played at home stadiums, and a home team scoring bias was perceived by many coaches, players, and writers. Controversies related to perceived bias or errors in scoring have led to questions about important baseball records, including several no-hitters and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak of 1941. By 1979, many major newspapers decided to ban their writers from scoring baseball games due to conflict-of-interest concerns, and in 1980 MLB began to hire independent official scorers.
Since 1980, some reforms have been suggested to improve the performance of official scorers. In 2001, MLB formed a scoring committee to review their performance, and by 2008 the committee was given the authority to overturn scoring decisions. This authority was used by the scoring committee three times during the 2009 season. In 2006, an academic study seemed to confirm the historical existence of a home-team bias in scoring decisions, but this measurable bias decreased after 1979.

In zoological anatomy, a cloaca [tpl]IPAc-en|k|l|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|k|ə[/tpl] is the posterior opening that serves as the only opening for the intestinal, reproductive, and urinary tracts of certain animal species. All amphibians, birds, reptiles, and monotremes possess this orifice, from which they excrete both urine and feces, unlike most placental mammals, which possess two or three separate orifices for evacuation.
The cloacal region is also often associated with a secretory organ, the cloacal gland, which has been implicated in the scent-marking behavior of some reptiles, amphibians, and monotremes.

[[Jaywalking]]
CATEGORIES: Crimes, Road safety, Walking

Jaywalking is illegal or reckless pedestrian crossing of a roadway. Examples include a pedestrian crossing between intersections without yielding to drivers and starting to cross a crosswalk at a signalized intersection without waiting for a permissive indication to be displayed. In the United States, state statutes generally reflect the Uniform Vehicle Code in requiring drivers to yield the right of way to pedestrians at crosswalks; at other locations, crossing pedestrians are either required to yield to drivers or, under some conditions, are prohibited from crossing. The term's dissemination in the 1920s and 1930s was due in part to the redefinition of some streets as places where pedestrians do not belong.
The United Kingdom does not formally describe priority regulations for drivers and pedestrians at road junctions or other locations, except with respect to marked Zebra, Pelican, and Puffin crossings, where motorists are required to give way to pedestrians under defined conditions.The Zebra, Pelican and Puffin Pedestrian Crossings Regulations and General Directions 1997. Elsewhere, the Highway Code relies on the pedestrian making their own judgement on whether it is safe to cross based on the Green Cross Code.  If the pedestrian's judgement was correct then no evasive re-action should be required by any drivers, but drivers are expected to avoid hazards and are examined on their ability to do so during the Hazard Perception Test.

The Daniels & Fisher (D&F) Tower is a distinctive Denver, Colorado landmark. Built as part of the Daniels & Fisher department store in 1910, it was the tallest between the Mississippi and California at the time of construction, at a height of 325 feet (99 m). The building was designed by the architect Frederick Sterner and modeled after The Campanile (St. Mark's Bell Tower) at the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy.Daniels & Fisher Tower - Building information, emporis.com  The 20-floor clock tower has clock faces on all four sides. Daniels & Fisher were later bought out by the May Company in 1958, and the store vacated the tower. When the store was demolished (ca. 1971), the tower was saved and renovated into lofts and businesses in 1981. It stands today in downtown Denver.
The basement level of the D&F tower now hosts Lannie's Clocktower Cabaret, Lannie Garrett's own entertainment venue.
The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. A 2½ ton bell occupies the top two floors of the building, above the observation deck.

USS ''Tambor'' (SS-198), the lead ship of her class of submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tambor.
Her keel was laid down on 16 January 1939 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 20 December 1939 sponsored by Miss Lucia Ellis, and commissioned on 3 June 1940 with Lieutenant Commander John M. Murphy, Jr. (Class of 1925),Blair, Silent Victory (Lippincott, 1975), p.901. in command.
After fitting out at New London, Tambor got underway on 6 August 1940 for her shakedown cruise which took her to New York City, Washington, D.C., Morehead City, North Carolina, and Houston, Texas. Following further training off Colón, Panama, the submarine returned to New London, Connecticut, before holding her acceptance trials and undergoing a post-shakedown overhaul at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. After conducting live-fire trials on the effectiveness of depth charges, the first of their kind in the U.S. Navy, Tambor reported in May 1941 to the Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, and the command of Rear Admiral Thomas W. Withers, Jr. (COMSUBPAC).Blair, p.83.
Tambor began a routine peacetime patrol in late November 1941 and was off Wake Island when hostilities with Japan broke out. However, she was forced to return to Pearl Harbor with one engine out of commission. Routed back to Mare Island, where the damage was repaired, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor in March 1942.

[[Language of flowers]]
CATEGORIES: Language of flowers, Victorian culture

The language of flowers, sometimes called floriography, is a means of cryptological communication through the use or arrangement of flowers. Meaning has been attributed to flowers for thousands of years, and some form of floriography has been practiced in traditional cultures throughout Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Plants and flowers are used as symbols in the Hebrew Bible — particularly of love and lovers in the Song of Songs,"1  I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. 2 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. 3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste." Song of Songs 2:1-3 as an emblem for the Israelite people"8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.  9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.  10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.  11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.  12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?  13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.  14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;  15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.  16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance."  Psalm 80:10-16 and for the coming Messiah"11 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots" Isaiah 11:1 — and of Jesus Christ in the New Testament."I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing." John 15:5 In Western Culture, William Shakespeare ascribed emblematic meanings to flowers, especially in Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.
Interest in floriography soared in Victorian England and in the United States during the 19th century. Gifts of blooms, plants, and specific floral arrangements were used to send a coded message to the recipient, allowing the sender to express feelings which could not be spoken aloud in Victorian society.[tpl]cite book | url = http://www.archive.org/details/languageofflower00gree | title = Language of Flowers | first = Kate | last = Greenaway | location = London | publisher = George Routledge and Sons | year = [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Tussie-Mussies: the Victorian Art of Expressing Yourself in the Language of Flowers | first = Geraldine Adamich | last = Laufer |publisher=Workman Publishing |year=1993[/tpl] Armed with floral dictionaries, Victorians often exchanged small "talking bouquets," called nosegays or tussie-mussies, which could be worn or carried as a fashion accessory.

Katharina von Bora, referred to as "die Lutherin" (January 29, 1499 – December 20, 1552), was the wife of Martin Luther, German
leader of the Protestant Reformation. Beyond what is found in the writings of Luther and some of his contemporaries, little is known about her. Despite this, Katharina is often considered one of the most important participants of the Reformation because of her role in helping to define Protestant family life and setting the tone for clergy marriages.

Brown hair is the second most common human hair color, after black hair. It varies from light brown to almost black hair. It is characterized by higher levels of the dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin. Its strands are thicker than those of fair hair but not as much as those of red hair. People with brown or black hair are often referred to as brunette, which in French is the feminine form of brunet, which is the diminutive of brun (brown, brown-haired or dark-haired).[tpl]cite web |title=Brunet |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/brunet[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Brunette|publisher=TheFreeDictionary.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/brunette[/tpl]

The name Audenshaw is a corruption of its earlier name Aldwinshagh which derives from Aldwin, a Saxon personal name, combined with the Old English suffix shagh meaning woodland. Nico Ditch, an early-medieval linear earthwork possibly built as a defensive barrier against Vikings, runs through the area. During the Middle Ages, Audenshaw was a division of the township of Ashton, in the county of Lancashire. Audenshaw's urbanisation and expansion largely coincided with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. In the 1870s, many of Audenshaw's inhabitants were employed in hat-making, cotton-spinning, calico-printing, and silk-weaving.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=879460&word=NULL|work=A vision of Britain through time|accessdate=4 September 2009|title=Descriptive Gazetteer Entry for Audenshaw|postscript=|author=Great Britain Historical GIS Project|year=2004|publisher=University of Portsmouth[/tpl] In 1894 this area became Audenshaw Urban District and in the poor law union of Ashton-under-Lyne.

Leigham is the name of an area of the city of Plymouth in the English county of Devon.
Originally a hamlet and manor separate from the city, urban expansion of the 20th century has meant that the area has become widely built up.  The area is located to the north east of Plymouth itself.
The place name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'an open space in a wood'.  In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was referred to as Leaham and was recorded as consisting of the manor and two farms.
Unfortunately the ancient manor house is no longer there: it fell into disrepair following the Second World War.The History of Leigham Manor, Devonshire
Leigham was in the parish of Plympton St Mary but is now in the parish of Estover, which itself was carved out of the manorial estate in the 1970s.

When he made his Test debut in January 1995, he was the first black cricketer - and the youngest person - to play for Zimbabwe.  His international career came to an end in 2003 after Olonga and team mate Andy Flower wore black armbands during an international cricket match in the 2003 Cricket World Cup to "mourn the death of democracy" in Zimbabwe.  Death threats forced him to live in exile in England.  He is now pursuing a career as a cricket commentator and singer.

Christopher Arthur Amon MBE (born 20 July 1943 in Bulls, New Zealand) is a former motor racing driver. He was active in Formula One – racing in the 1960s and 1970s – and is widely regarded to be one of the best F1 drivers never to win a championship Grand Prix. His reputation for bad luck was such that fellow driver Mario Andretti once joked that "if he became an undertaker, people would stop dying". Former Ferrari's Technical Director Mauro Forghieri stated that Amon was "by far the best test driver I have ever worked with.

[[Angle of repose]]

CATEGORIES: Particulates, Soil mechanics, Engineering concepts

The angle of repose or the critical angle of repose, of a granular material is the steepest angle of descent or dip  relative to the horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping. At this angle, the material on the slope face is on the verge of sliding. The angle of repose can range from 0° to 90°. Smooth, rounded sand grains cannot be piled as steeply as can rough, interlocking sands. If a small amount of water is able to bridge the gaps between particles, electrostatic attraction of the water to mineral surfaces will increase soil strength.
When bulk granular materials are poured onto a horizontal surface, a conical pile will form. The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the density, surface area and shapes of the particles, and the coefficient of friction of the material. However, a 2011 study shows that the angle of repose is also gravity-dependent. Material with a low angle of repose forms flatter piles than material with a high angle of repose.
The term has a related usage in mechanics, where it refers to the maximum angle at which an object can rest on an inclined plane without sliding down. This angle is equal to the arctangent of the coefficient of static friction μs between the surfaces.

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth languages

Common Eldarin, or simply Eldarin, is a constructed language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is one of the many fictional languages set in his fictional universe of Middle-earth.
Common Eldarin is a tongue spoken by Elves called Eldar or the West-Elves. Common Eldarin evolved directly from the original speech of all Elves, Primitive Quendian (called Quenderin in Quenya). It was the language of all the Eldar—those Elves who decided to undertake the Great March to Valinor—before their divisions.
Common Eldarin is not actually a constructed language in the proper sense, as Tolkien didn't elaborate on its vocabulary or grammar, but merely a chronological stage of the Primitive Quendian. Common Eldarin is mentioned mainly in the context of a set of phonological rules and evolutionary stages of the Elvish languages between Primitive Quendian and the later languages. Although virtually all Primitive Quendian forms can be reconstructed as Common Eldarin, there is no particular Common Eldarin philology.

The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C. in August 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, the Idles' recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 Minor Disturbance EP before their broke up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing the Teen Idles 7" record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk outfit Minor Threat.
The Teen Idles were among the first punk rock groups from the early 1980s hardcore movement to break out of their regional scene to tour and sell nationally.Lahickey, 100 Inspired by other American punk bands like the Cramps and Bad Brains, the Teen Idles' music was an early version of hardcore punk, and an attempt, in the words of MacKaye, "to get away from a really corrupted music."Azerrad, 123 Their appearances, lyrics and musical style sought to revive a punk movement that they believed had lost its original zeal.

[[Taliska]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth languages

Taliska is a constructed language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is one of the many fictional languages set in his secondary world, often called Middle-earth. 
Taliska was based on the Gothic language.J.R.R. Tolkien, "The Comparative Tales", Parma Eldalamberon 19, p. 22 Gothic was an early interest of Tolkien. A grammar and a lexicon of Taliska are known to exist, but [tpl]As of|2012|lc=on[/tpl] they have not been published.
In Middle-earth, Taliska, when first devised, was the language spoken by Men of the houses of Bëor and Hador.
Adûnaic, the language of Númenor, later displaced Taliska.  During the writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien toyed with the idea of making Taliska the primordial tongue of the people of Rohan who spoke Old English in his translated setting of The Lord of the Rings.

Sister Rosetta Tharpe (March 20, 1915 – October 9, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist and recording artist. A pioneer of twentieth-century music, Tharpe attained great popularity in the 1930s and 1940s with her gospel recordings that were a unique mixture of spiritual lyrics and rhythmic/early rock accompaniment. She became gospel music's first crossover artist and its first great recording star, referred to later as "the original soul sister".http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sister-rosetta-tharpe-mn0000013511http://www.last.fm/music/Sister+Rosetta+TharpeWald, Gayle, Shout, Sister, Shout! Preface p. vii She was an early influence on iconic figures such as Little Richard, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/sister-rosetta-tharpe-got-rock-rolling-long-before-elvis/
Willing to cross the line between sacred and secular by performing her music of 'light' in the 'darkness' of the nightclubs and concert halls with big bands behind her, Tharpe pushed spiritual music into the mainstream and helped pioneer the rise of pop-gospel beginning with her 1939 hit "This Train."  Her unique music left a lasting mark on more conventional gospel artists such as Ira Tucker, Sr. of the Dixie Hummingbirds. While she offended some conservative churchgoers with her forays into the pop world, she never left gospel music.
Tharpe's 1944 hit "Down By The Riverside" was selected for the American Library of Congress National Recording Registry in 2004, with the citation stating that it captured her "spirited guitar playing" and "unique vocal style", which were an influence on early rhythm and blues performers, as well as gospel, jazz, and rock artists.http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-masterlist.html  Her 1945 hit "Strange Things Happening Every Day", recorded in late 1944, featured Tharpe's vocals and electric guitar, with Sammy Price (piano), bass and drums.  It was the first gospel record to cross over, hitting #2 on the Billboard "race records" chart, the term then used for what later became the R&B chart, in April 1945.[tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=440[/tpl]Jason Ankeny, Biography of Rosetta Tharpe, Allmusic.com The recording has been cited as an important precursor of rock and roll.Dan DeLuca, Sister Rosetta Tharpe got rock rolling long before Elvis, The Philadelphia Inquirer, 26 February 2007  Tharpe has been called the Godmother of Rock n' Roll."The Godmother of Rock & Roll: Sister Rosetta Tharpe", broadcast in UK by BBC Four on 24 May 2011

The Amoebozoa are a major group of amoeboid protozoa, including the majority that move by means of 
internal cytoplasmic flow.  Their pseudopodia are characteristically blunt and finger-like, 
called lobopodia.  Most are unicellular, and are common in soils and aquatic habitats, with some found as symbiotes 
of other organisms, including several pathogens.  The Amoebozoa also include the slime moulds, multinucleate or 
multicellular forms that produce spores and are usually visible to the unaided eye.
Amoebozoa vary greatly in size.  Many are only 10-20 μm in size, but they also include many of the larger 
protozoa.  The famous species Amoeba proteus may reach 800 μm in length, and partly on account of 
its size is often studied as a representative cell.  Multinucleate amoebae like Chaos and 
Pelomyxa may be several millimetres in length, and some slime moulds cover several square feet.

He studied the violin under Giovanni Battista Viotti and taught at the Paris Conservatoire together with Pierre Rode (also a pupil of Viotti) and Rodolphe Kreutzer, who wrote the conservatoire's official violin method (published in the early 19th century). He was sole author of the instructional L'art du violon (1834). Baillot's teachings had a profound influence on technical and musical development in an age in which virtuosity was openly encouraged. He was leader of the Paris Opéra, gave solo recitals and was a notable performer of chamber music. He died in Paris in 1842.

Arundinaria, commonly known as the canes, is the sole genus of bamboo native to eastern North America and the only temperate bamboo in North America. The genus is endemic to the eastern United States from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Ohio and Texas. Within this region they are found from the Coastal Plain to medium elevations in the Appalachian Mountains. Its members have running rhizomes and are woody and tree-like, attaining heights from 0.5 up to 8 metres (1.5 to 26 feet). They produce seeds only rarely and usually reproduce vegetatively, forming large genets. When seed production does occur, the colony usually dies afterwards. Among the distinctive features of the canes is a fan-like cluster of leaves at the top of new stems called a top knot. 
The genus Arundinaria has a complex taxonomic history spanning over two centuries. The canes of the southeastern U.S. were originally described as two species of reed grasses in the genus Arundo by Thomas Walter in 1788. André Michaux, working in 1803 and unaware of Walter's work, correctly interpreted the canes as a distinct group and created the genus Arundinaria with one species. However, neither of these researchers left enough information to their successors, leading to confusion surrounding the identity of the species they had described. The later workers G.H.E. Muhlenberg and A.S. Hitchcock each changed the circumscriptions of the species within the group, but it wasn't until epitypes, type specimens that clarify older ambiguous names, were applied to Walter's and Michaux's species in 2009 that the taxonomy could be stabilised. Meanwhile, many similar Asian and even African bamboos were placed in this genus under a very broad concept for the group. Preliminary phylogenetic studies in 2006 using molecular and morphological evidence have suggested that the genus forms three natural species confined to the southeastern United States. 
Early explorers in the U.S. described vast monotypic stands of Arundinaria called canebrakes that were especially common in river lowlands. These often covered hundreds of thousands of hectares.  These have declined significantly due to clearing, farming and fire suppression. Prior to the European colonization of the Americas, cane was an extremely important resource for local Native Americans. The plant was used to make everything from houses and weapons to jewelry and medicines. It was used extensively as a fuel, and parts of the plant were eaten. The canebrakes also provided ideal land for crops, habitat for wild game, and year-round forage for livestock. After colonisation, cane lost its importance due to the destruction and decline of canebrakes, forced relocation of indigenous people, and the availability of superior technology from abroad.

is a genus of bamboo.  The species are native to Asia with a large number of species found in Central China, but can now be found in many warm temperate and subtropical areas around the world as cultivated plants or escapes from cultivation.  Most of the species spread aggressively by underground rhizomes.  
The stem or culm has a prominent groove, called a sulcus, that runs along the length of each segment (or internode).  Because of this it is one of the most easily identifiable genera of bamboo.
There are approximately 75 species and 200 varieties and cultivars of Phyllostachys. The largest grow to be about 100 feet (30 m) tall in optimum conditions.  Some of the larger species, sometimes known as "timber bamboo", are used as construction timber and for making furniture.
The name Phyllostachys means "leaf spike" and refers to the inflorescences.[tpl]cite book|last=Coombes|first=Allen J.|title=The A to Z of plant names|year=2012|publisher=Timber Press|location=USA|isbn=9781604694962|pages=312[/tpl]

The band was occasionally joined by Todd Grant on rhythm guitar for live performances in later years.
The band members were advocates of the DIY punk ethic, as popularized by bands such as Fugazi and The Minutemen. Replicator started as a bay area Indie rock band of little distinction before finding their signature sound, often compared to bands such as Shellac, The Jesus Lizard, Steel Pole Bathtub and The Melvins. The band had multiple songs influenced by literary works, including those of Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen King, Philip K. Dick and Neal Stephenson. Largely ignored both the mainstream and underground music world, their irreverent attitude, unconventional attitude and "cleverness" won them over a very small but dedicated fanbase, including a handful of famous fans, including comedian Patton Oswalt and comic book author Warren Ellis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.warrenellis.com/?m=20060929 |title=2006 » September » 29 |publisher=Warren Ellis |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=2012-01-09[/tpl]

Shibataea is a genus of bamboo. It is used to make canes.
It is a unique shorter bamboo with dark green leaves. This genus of small bamboos are more closely related to the genus Phyllostachys than other small bamboos. An excellent tall groundcover or short hedge, this species is especially suited to climates similar to that of the Pacific Northwest since it dislikes dry climates. The bamboo does not do well with alkaline or water-logged soil. It needs acidic conditions to prevent leaf burn. It is sometimes called Ruscus-leaved bamboo, as the shape of the leaves resembles that of the Ruscus genus. This bamboo is very resistant to bamboo mites.

The Blueprint is the sixth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, released September 11, 2001 on Roc-A-Fella Records in the United States. Its release was set a week earlier than initially planned in order to combat bootlegging. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2001 at Manhattan Center Studios and Baseline Studios in New York City. Contrasting the radio-friendly sound of Jay-Z's previous work, The Blueprint features soul-based sampling and production handled primarily by Kanye West and Just Blaze.Hoard, Christian.

CATEGORIES: Populated places established in 1905, 1926 disestablishments, Monuments and memorials in Israel, Villages depopulated during the Arab–Israeli conflict

Tel Hai ([tpl]lang-he-n|תֵּל חַי[/tpl], meaning "Hill of Life" in Hebrew; Tal-ha in Arabic) is a name of a former Jewish settlement in northern Israel, the site of an early battle in the Arab–Israeli conflict, and of a noted monument, tourist attraction, and a college. It is currently part of kibbutz Kfar Giladi.
The Battle of Tel Hai on 1 March 1920, which gave Tel Hai its long-enduring fame, was significant far beyond the small number of fighters involved on either side - mainly due to its influence on Israeli culture, both inspiring an enduring heroic story and profoundly influencing the military of the Yishuv and political strategies over several decades. 
In retrospect, it can be regarded as the first military engagement between the New Yishuv (later to become Israel) and Arab rebels (of what was to become Syria), though at the time itself combatants on either side did not regard it in such terms.

[[Hyperpolarization (biology)]]
CATEGORIES: Nervous system, Membrane biology, Electrophysiology, Electrochemistry, Cellular neuroscience

Hyperpolarization is a change in a cell's membrane potential that makes it more negative. It is the opposite of a depolarization.  It inhibits action potentials by increasing the stimulus required to move the membrane potential to the action potential threshold.
Hyperpolarization is often caused by efflux of K+ (a cation) through K+ channels, or influx of Cl– (an anion) through Cl– channels. On the other hand, influx of cations, e.g. Na+ through Na+ channels or Ca2+ through Ca2+ channels, inhibits hyperpolarization. If a cell has Na+ or Ca2+ currents at rest, then inhibition of those currents will also result in a hyperpolarization. This voltage-gated ion channel response is how the hyperpolarizaion state is achieved. In neurons, the cell enters a state of hyperpolarization immediately following the generation of an action potential. While hyperpolarized, the neuron is in a refractory period that lasts roughly 2 milliseconds, during which the neuron is unable to generate subsequent action potentials. Sodium-potassium ATPases redistribute K+ and Na+ ions until the membrane potential is back to its resting potential of around –70 millivolts, at which point the neuron is once again ready to transmit another action potential.Pack, Phillip E.

[[The man on the Clapham omnibus]]
CATEGORIES: Legal fictions, English phrases, British English idioms

The man on the Clapham omnibus is a hypothetical reasonable person, used by the courts in English law where it is necessary to decide whether a party has acted as a reasonable person would — for example, in a civil action for negligence. The man on the Clapham omnibus is a reasonably educated and intelligent but nondescript person, against whom the defendant's conduct can be measured. The concept was used by Greer LJ in the case of Hall v. Brooklands Auto-Racing Club (1933) to define the standard of care a defendant must live up to in order to avoid being found negligent.
The phrase was first put to legal use in a reported judgment by Sir Richard Henn Collins MR in the 1903 English Court of Appeal libel case, McQuire v. Western Morning News.1903 2 KB 100 (CA) at 109 per Collins MR He attributed it to Lord Bowen, said to have coined it as junior counsel defending the Tichborne Claimant case in 1871. Brewer's also lists this as a possible first use.
It may be derived from the phrase "Public opinion ... is the opinion of the bald-headed man at the back of the omnibus," a description by the 19th-century journalist Walter Bagehot of a normal London man. Clapham, in South London, was at the time a nondescript commuter suburb seen to represent "ordinary" London. Omnibus is now rather an archaic term for a public bus, but was in common use by the judiciary at the beginning of the 20th century.
The expression has also been incorporated in Canadian patent jurisprudence, notably Beloit v. Valmet Oy (1986), C.P.R. (3d) 289 in its discussion of the test for obviousness.
In Australia, the "Clapham omnibus" expression has inspired the New South Wales and Victorian equivalents, "the man on the Bondi tram" and "the man on the Bourke Street tram".
In Hong Kong, the equivalent expression is "the man on the Shaukiwan Tram."

CATEGORIES: 527 organizations, Internal Revenue Code, Campaign finance in the United States

A 527 organization or 527 group is a type of U.S. tax-exempt organization organized under Section 527 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code ([tpl]usc|26|527[/tpl]). A 527 group is created primarily to influence the selection, nomination, election, appointment or defeat of candidates to federal, state or local public office.
Technically, almost all political committees, including state, local, and federal candidate committees, traditional political action committees, "Super PACs", and political parties are "527s." However, in common practice the term is usually applied only to such organizations that are not regulated under state or federal campaign finance laws because they do not "expressly advocate" for the election or defeat of a candidate or party.
There are no upper limits on contributions to 527s and no restrictions on who may contribute. There are no spending limits imposed on these organizations; however, they must register with the IRS, publicly disclose their donors and file periodic reports of contributions and expenditures.The Center for Public Integrity, 527 Frequently Asked Questions http://projects.publicintegrity.org/527/default.aspx?act=faq#5
Because they may not expressly advocate for specific candidates or coordinate with any candidate’s campaign, many 527s are used to raise money to spend on issue advocacy and voter mobilization.  Examples of 527s include Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, Texans for Truth, The Media Fund, America Coming Together, the Progress for America Voter Fund, and the Secretary of State Project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~eroberts/cs181/projects/2004-05/political-action/527one.html |title=What are 527's? | Who Donates? | Where does the money go?

He continued on the work started by the first Sikh Guru.
Guru Angad  married Mata Khivi in January 1520 and had two sons (Dasu and Datu) and two daughters (Amro and Anokhi). The entire family of his father had left their ancestral village in fear of the invasion of Babar's armies. After this the family settled at Khadur Sahib, a village by the River Beas near what is now Tarn Taran a small town about 25 km from the city of Amritsar, the holiest of Sikh cities.

[[Hereditary coproporphyria]]
CATEGORIES: Porphyrias, Skin conditions resulting from errors in metabolism

Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is a disorder of heme biosynthesis, classified as an acute hepatic porphyria.[tpl]cite web|title= #121300  COPROPORPHYRIA, HEREDITARY;  HCP|url=http://omim.org/entry/121300|accessdate=2012-05-27|publisher=Johns Hopkins University[/tpl]  HCP is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase, coded for by the CPOX gene, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although homozygous individuals have been identified.  Unlike acute intermittent porphyria, individuals with HCP can present with cutaneous findings similar to those found in porphyria cutanea tarda in addition to the acute attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting and neurological dysfunction characteristic of acute porphyrias. Like other porphyrias, attacks of HCP can be induced by certain drugs, environmental stressors or diet changes.  Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect.  Overall, porphyrias are rare diseases.  The combined incidence for all forms of the disease has been estimated at 1:20,000.  The exact incidence of HCP is difficult to determine, due to its reduced penetrance.

[[Charism]]
CATEGORIES: Charismatic and Pentecostal Christianity, Religious behaviour and experience, Social psychology, Spiritual gifts, Christian terms

In Christian theology, a charism (in Greek: χαρίσμα; plural: charismata) in general denotes any good gift that flows from God's love to humans. The word can also mean any of the spiritual graces and qualifications granted to every Christian to perform his or her task in the Church. In the narrowest sense, it is a theological term for the extraordinary graces given to individual Christians for the good of others.  
These extraordinary spiritual gifts, often termed "charismatic gifts", are the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, increased faith, the gifts of healing, the gift of miracles, prophecy, the discerning of spirits, diverse kinds of tongues, interpretation of tongues (1 Corinthians 12:8-10). To these are added the gifts of apostles, prophets, teachers, helps (connected to service of the poor and sick), and governments (or leadership ability) which are connected with certain offices in the Church. These gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to individuals, but their purpose is to build up the entire Church. 
The charismata in this narrowest sense are distinguished from the graces given for personal sanctification, such as the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit.

[[Faraday effect]]

CATEGORIES: Optics, Magnetism, Michael Faraday, Polarization (waves)

In physics, the Faraday effect or Faraday rotation is a magneto-optical phenomenon, that is,  an interaction between light and a magnetic field in a medium. The Faraday effect causes a rotation of the plane of polarization which is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field in the direction of propagation. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal.[tpl]cite journal |last=Prati |first=E. |year=2003 |title=Propagation in gyroelectromagnetic guiding systems |journal=J. of Electr. Wav. and Appl. |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=1177–1196 |doi=10.1163/156939303322519810 [/tpl]
Discovered by Michael Faraday in 1845,  the Faraday effect was the first experimental evidence that light and electromagnetism are related. The theoretical basis of electromagnetic radiation (which includes visible light) was completed by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s and 1870s. This effect occurs in most optically transparent dielectric materials (including liquids) under the influence of magnetic fields.
The Faraday effect is caused by left and right circularly polarized waves propagating at slightly different speeds, a property known as circular birefringence. Since a linear polarization can be decomposed into the superposition of two equal-amplitude circularly polarized components of opposite handedness and different phase, the effect of a relative phase shift, induced by the Faraday effect, is to rotate the orientation of a wave's linear polarization.
The Faraday effect has a few applications in measuring instruments. For instance, the Faraday effect has been used to measure optical rotatory power and for remote sensing of magnetic fields. The Faraday effect is used in spintronics research to study the polarization of electron spins in semiconductors. Faraday rotators can be used for amplitude modulation of light, and are the basis of optical isolators and optical circulators; such components are required in optical telecommunications and other laser applications.See http://www.rp-photonics.com/regenerative_amplifiers.html

[[Regular polytope]]

CATEGORIES: Polytopes, Symmetry, Multi-dimensional geometry

In mathematics, a regular polytope is a polytope whose symmetry is transitive on its flags, thus giving it the highest degree of symmetry. All its elements or j-faces (for all 0 ≤ j ≤ n, where n is the dimension of the polytope) — cells, faces and so on — are also transitive on the symmetries of the polytope, and are regular polytopes of dimension ≤ n. 
Regular polytopes are the generalized analog in any number of dimensions of regular polygons (for example, the square or the regular pentagon) and regular polyhedra (for example, the cube). The strong symmetry of the regular polytopes gives them an aesthetic quality that interests both non-mathematicians and mathematicians.
Classically, a regular polytope in n dimensions may be defined as having regular facets (n − 1)-faces and regular vertex figures. These two conditions are sufficient to ensure that all faces are alike and all vertices are alike. Note, however, that this definition does not work for abstract polytopes.
A regular polytope can be represented by a Schläfli symbol of the form {a, b, c, ...., y, z}, with regular facets as {a, b, c, ..., y}, and regular vertex figures as {b, c, ..., y, z}.

[[Crusader tank]]

CATEGORIES: Armoured fighting vehicles of Argentina, Cruiser tanks, World War II tanks of the United Kingdom

The Tank, Cruiser, Mk VI or A15 Crusader was one of the primary British cruiser tanks of the early part Second World War and perhaps the most important British tank of the North African Campaign. 
The Crusader's mobility made it a favourite of British tank crews and once upgraded with the Ordnance QF 6 pounder main gun made it more than a match for the early Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks it faced in combat. 
Retained in service because of delays with its replacement, by late 1942 the lack of armament upgrade combined with the presence of Tiger I Tanks among the Afrika Korps and reliability problems due to the harsh desert conditions, led to the Crusader being replaced in the main line of battle by US-supplied M3 Grant and Sherman medium tanks. The next British cruiser in combat would be the Cromwell heavy cruiser.

The Douglas SBD Dauntless was a World War II American naval scout plane and dive bomber that was manufactured by Douglas Aircraft from 1940 through 1944. The SBD ("Scout Bomber Douglas") was the U.S. Navy's main carrier-borne scout plane and dive bomber from mid-1940 through mid-1944. The SBD was also flown by the U.S. Marine Corps, both from land air bases and aircraft carriers. The SBD is best remembered as the bomber that delivered the fatal blows to the Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway in June 1942.
During its combat service, the SBD was an excellent naval scout plane and arguably the world's best dive bomber. It possessed long range, good handling characteristics, maneuverability, potent bomb load capacity, great diving characteristics, defensive armament and ruggedness. In most of these characteristics, the SBD was superior to the German Junkers Ju 87, the Japanese Aichi D3A "Val", and any dive bomber possessed by the Royal Air Force or the Soviet Air Force.[tpl]cn|date=August 2013[/tpl] A variant was a purpose-built design for the U.S. Army Air Forces, which used the SBD without an arrestor hook as the A-24 Banshee.

The Sonics are an American garage rock band from Tacoma, Washington, originating in the early 1960s. Among the Sonics' contemporaries were the Kingsmen, the Wailers, the Dynamics, the Regents, and Paul Revere & the Raiders. Their aggressive, hard-edged sound has been a major influence on punk, garage, and hard rock music worldwide, and they've been named as inspirations by Nirvana, Bruce Springsteen, the Fall, and other major artists.
They played a mixture of garage rock standards ("Louie, Louie", "Have Love, Will Travel"), early rock and roll ("Jenny, Jenny", "Skinny Minnie") and original compositions such as "Strychnine", "Psycho", and "The Witch", all based upon simple chord sequences, played hard and fast.
The lyrics of The Sonics' original material dealt with early 1960s teenage culture: cars, guitars, surfing, and girls (in songs like "The Hustler", "Boss Hoss" and "Maintaining My Cool") alongside darker subject matter such as drinking strychnine for kicks, witches, psychopaths, and Satan (in the songs "Strychnine", "The Witch", "Psycho", and "He's Waitin'", respectively).

[[Rock flour]]

CATEGORIES: Glaciology, Soil, Agronomy

Rock flour, or glacial flour, consists of fine-grained, silt-sized particles of rock, generated by mechanical grinding of bedrock by glacial erosion or by artificial grinding to a similar size. Because the material is very small, it becomes suspended in meltwater making the water appear cloudy, which is sometimes known as glacial milk."Glossary of Terms: G: Glacial Milk" PhysicalGeography.netGornitz, Vivien (editor) (2007) "Glacial Geomorphology" pp. 361-374 Encyclopedia of paleoclimatology and ancient environments Springer Netherland, Berlin, page 365, ISBN 978-1-4020-4551-6 
When the sediments enter a river, they turn the river's colour grey, light brown, iridescent blue-green, or milky white. If the river flows into a glacial lake, the lake may appear turquoise in colour as a result. When flows of the flour are extensive, a distinct layer of a different colour flows into the lake and begins to dissipate and settle as the flow extends from the increase in water flow from the glacier during snow melts and heavy rain periods. Examples of this phenomenon may be seen at Lake Louise and Peyto Lake in Canada and Gjende lake in Norway.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|ŋ[/tpl][/tpl], and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is N. The IPA symbol [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|ŋ[/tpl][/tpl] is similar to [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|ɳ[/tpl][/tpl], the symbol for the retroflex nasal, which has a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem, and to [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|ɲ[/tpl][/tpl], the symbol for the palatal nasal, which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the left stem. Both the IPA symbol and the sound are commonly called 'eng' or 'engma' (not to be confused with the Greek letter angma.)  
As a phoneme, the velar nasal does not occur in many of the indigenous languages of the Americas or in a large number of European or Middle Eastern languages, but it is extremely common in Australian Aboriginal languages. While almost all languages have [tpl]IPA|/m/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/n/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ŋ/[/tpl] is rarer.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|2005|p=164[/tpl]. The oral counterparts, [tpl]IPA|/p t k/[/tpl] are found together in almost all languages Only half of the 469 languages surveyed in [tpl]Harvcoltxt|Anderson|2008[/tpl] had a velar nasal phoneme; as a further curiosity, a large proportion of them limits its occurrence to the syllable coda. In many languages that do not have the velar nasal as a phoneme, it occurs as an allophone of other nasals before velar consonants.
As with the voiced velar stop [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl], the relative rarity of the velar nasal is because the small oral cavity, used to produce velar consonants, makes it more difficult for voicing to be sustained.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] It also makes it much more difficult to allow air to escape through the nose, as is required for a nasal.

[[Locally convex topological vector space]]

CATEGORIES: Topological vector spaces

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, locally convex topological vector spaces or locally convex spaces are examples of topological vector spaces (TVS) that generalize normed spaces.   They can be defined as topological vector spaces whose topology is generated by translations of  balanced, absorbent, convex sets.  Alternatively they can be defined as a vector space with a family of seminorms, and a topology can be defined in terms of that family.  Although in general such spaces are not necessarily normable, the existence of a convex local base for the zero vector is strong enough for the Hahn–Banach theorem to hold, yielding a sufficiently rich theory of continuous linear functionals.
Fréchet spaces are locally convex spaces that are metrizable and complete with respect to this metric. They are generalizations of Banach spaces, which are complete vector spaces with respect to a norm.

CATEGORIES: Lütjens-class destroyers, Ships built in Maine, 1967 ships, Steam turbine-powered ships

Lütjens was a guided missile destroyer of the Bundesmarine (West German navy) and subsequently the German Navy (navy of reunited Germany). She was the lead ship of the Lütjens class, a modification of the Charles F. Adams class.  The ship was named for Admiral Günther Lütjens, who commanded the battlegroup Bismarck and Prinz Eugen during Operation Rheinübung (Exercise Rhine). Lütjens was killed when Bismarck was surrounded by overwhelming British naval force on 27 May 1941 in the North Atlantic. 
The ship was laid down at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine on 1 March 1966 with the hull classification symbol DDG-28. She was launched on 11 August 1967 and commissioned on 22 March 1969. On 14 September 2001, three days after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, the crew of the destroyer Lütjens manned the rails, and as they approached the destroyers [tpl]USS|Winston S. Churchill|DDG-81|6[/tpl] and [tpl]USS|Gonzalez|DDG-66|6[/tpl], they displayed an American flag and a banner reading "We Stand By You."
After over 30 years of service and a travelled distance of [tpl]convert|800000|nmi|km|lk=in[/tpl] Lütjens was decommissioned on 18 December 2003. She was the last steam-powered vessel and the last ship classified as a destroyer of the German Navy.

[[Pleasure at Her Majesty's]]

CATEGORIES: Amnesty International

Pleasure At Her Majesty's was the name given to the filmed release of A Poke In The Eye (With A Sharp Stick), the first of the Amnesty International comedy benefit galas. The title is a play on the phrase at Her Majesty's pleasure (the show was performed at Her Majesty's Theatre, London). In America, the film was originally called Monty Python Meets Beyond the Fringe.
This show came to be considered part of the Secret Policeman's Ball series of shows that it inspired, although it pre-dated the first show in the series by three years.
The event was organized by a team of three: Monty Python member John Cleese, Amnesty's Assistant Director Peter Luff and Transatlantic Records executive Martin Lewis. It featured the cream of Britain's comedic talent of the era, setting a precedent that would inspire many subsequent Amnesty galas, as well as Comic Relief. The concept was also the inspiration of similar events, also in aid of Amnesty International in countries around the world as far away as Australia, in the case of the Stand Up For Your Rights Comedy Galas.
The film consists of both on-stage and back-stage footage, taken from all three nights of the run (1 –3 April 1976).
Luff and Lewis collaborated on producing the successor show - video-taped in 1977 as The Mermaid Frolics.  Then Cleese and Lewis teamed up (with Amnesty's new fundraising director Peter Walker) in 1979 to create The Secret Policeman's Ball - the first show to carry what became the iconic Secret Policeman's Ball title.

The Tokyo Express was the name given by Allied forces to the use of Imperial Japanese Navy ships at night to deliver personnel, supplies, and equipment to Japanese forces operating in and around New Guinea and the Solomon Islands during the Pacific campaign of World War II. The operation involved loading personnel or supplies aboard fast warships (mainly destroyers), later submarines, and using the warships' speed to deliver the personnel or supplies to the desired location and return to the originating base all within one night so Allied aircraft could not intercept them by day.

D186 ''Mölders was a guided missile destroyer of the Bundesmarine (West German Navy) and later the Deutsche Marine'' (Navy of reunited Germany). It was the second ship of the Lütjens class, a modification of the Charles F. Adams class.
On March 3, 1965 Bath Iron Works got the order to build Mölders and her keel was laid down on April 12, 1966 with the hull number DDG-29. April 13, 1967 Mölders was launched and christened for Luftwaffe Oberst (Colonel) Werner Mölders by his mother Anne-Marie Mölders. Mölders was commissioned on February 23, 1969 into the 1. Zerstörergeschwader (first destroyer squadron) based in Kiel.
During her 33 years in commission 14,000 sailors served on her under 16 commanders, and she traveled 675,054.6 nautical miles. The Mölders was decommissioned May 28, 2003 in Wilhelmshaven.
Unlike her sisters [tpl]Ship|German destroyer|Lütjens|D185|3[/tpl] and [tpl]Ship|German destroyer|Rommel|D187|3[/tpl], Mölders was preserved and is now on display as museum ship at the Deutsches Marinemuseum at Wilhelmshaven, although she was, ironically, never stationed in Wilhelmshaven during her active career.

Sam Dolgoff (1902–1990) was an American anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist.Porton, p.40
Dolgoff was born in the shtetl of Ostrovno in Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Beshankovichy Raion, Belarus),Avrich, p.419 moving as a child to New York City in 1905 or 1906,Avrich, ibid. where he lived in the Bronx and in Manhattan's Lower East Side where he died. His father was a house painter, and Dolgoff began house painting at the age of 11, a profession he remained in his entire life.
After being expelled from the Young People's Socialist League, Sam joined the Industrial Workers of the World in the 1922Avrich, p.420 and remained an active member his entire life, playing an active role in the anarchist movement for much of the century. He was a co-founder of the Libertarian Labor Review magazine, which was later renamed Anarcho-Syndicalist Review to avoid confusion with America's Libertarian Party.
Dolgoff was a member of the Chicago Free Society Group in the 1920s, Vanguard Group member and editor of its publication Vanguard: A Journal of Libertarian CommunismKayton, p.155 in the 1930s, and co-founded the Libertarian League in New York in 1954.Greeman, p.13 He wrote articles for anarchist magazines as well as books as the editor of highly-acclaimed anthologies, some of which are listed below. He was active in many causes, and attended groups like New York's Libertarian Book Club regularly.
Dolgoff, and his wife Esther, served as a link to anarchism's past to young anarchists of the 1960s and 1970s living in New York. He focused upon anarchism's (specifically anarcho-syndicalism's) roots in workers' movements and served as a moderating counterbalance to the punk-era anarchists who tended towards 'monkeywrenching' and confrontations with the police. Although Dolgoff was friends with Murray Bookchin, a notable anarchist theorist of the period, he was opposed to Bookchin's theory of Social Ecology, rooted as he was in the classical anarchist traditions of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin.

The Ganongs were descendants of Huguenots who fled persecution in France and emigrated to New Amsterdam in the second half of the 17th century, the family name "Ganong" is a corruption of the original French language name, "Guenon".
Ganong Bros.' Limited has been one of the chocolate industry's most important companies.  Arthur Ganong was the first to make any sort of a wrapped chocolate bar;  Ganong began selling the first chocolate bars in 1910. In 1920 they began using the brand name "Pal-O-Mine" for their chocolate bar.
The company also was the first to introduce a heart-shaped box of chocolates in North America. The heart-shaped boxes were originally used for presents over the Christmas season before it also succeeded around Valentine's Day
In 1911, Ganong Bros. purchased the bankrupt White Candy Company in Saint John, New Brunswick and operated a factory there until 1931.

Tus was taken by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and remained under Umayyad control until 747, when a subordinate of Abu Muslim Khorasani defeated the Umayyad governor.Tus, V. Minorsky, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. X, ed. P.J. Bearman, T. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs, (Brill, 2000), 741. In 809, the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid fell ill and died in Tus, on his way to solve the unrest in Khorasan.The Court of the Caliphs by Hugh N Kennedy (ISBN 0 297 83000 7)
Tus was almost entirely destroyed by the Mongol conquests between 1220-1259.
Perhaps the most famous resident of Tus was the poet Ferdowsi, author of the Persian epic Shahnameh.  His mausoleum, built in 1934 in time for the millennium of his birth, dominates the town. Other notable residents of Tus include the early polymath Jābir ibn Hayyān; the poet Asadi Tusi; the powerful Seljuk vizier Nizam al-Mulk; the theologian, jurist, philosopher, and mystic al-Ghazali; the medieval polymath Nasir al-Din al-Tusi; and the prominent Twelver Shi'i Islamic scholar Abu Ja'far Tusi.

The Grumman F4F Wildcat was an American carrier-based fighter aircraft that began service with both the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy (as the Martlet) in 1940. First used in combat by the British in Europe, the Wildcat was the only effective fighter available to the United States Navy and Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater during the early part of World War II in 1941 and 1942; the disappointing Brewster Buffalo was withdrawn in favor of the Wildcat and replaced as units became available.  With a top speed of [tpl]convert|318|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], the Wildcat was still outperformed by the faster [tpl]convert|331|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], more maneuverable, and longer ranged  Mitsubishi A6M Zero. But the F4F's ruggedness, coupled with tactics such as the Thach Weave, resulted in an air combat kill-to-loss ratio of 5.9:1 in 1942 and 6.9:1 for the entire war.Polmar 2004
Lessons learned from the Wildcat were later applied to the faster F6F Hellcat which, with the exception of range,Tillman 1983, pp. 5, 96. could outperform the Zero on its own terms. The Wildcat continued to be built throughout the remainder of the war to serve on escort carriers, where larger and heavier fighters could not be used.

[[Glycoside]]
CATEGORIES: Carbohydrate chemistry, Glycosides

In chemistry, a glycoside [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|l|aɪ|k|ə|s|aɪ|d[/tpl] is a molecule in which a sugar is bound to another functional group via a glycosidic bond. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms. Many plants store chemicals in the form of inactive glycosides. These can be activated by enzyme hydrolysis,[tpl]cite book|last=Brito-Arias|first=Marco|title=Synthesis and Characterization of Glycosides|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=978-0-387-26251-2[/tpl] which causes the sugar part to be broken off, making the chemical available for use. Many such plant glycosides are used as medications. In animals and humans, poisons are often bound to sugar molecules as part of their elimination from the body.
In formal terms, a glycoside is any molecule in which a sugar group is bonded through its anomeric carbon to another group via a glycosidic bond. Glycosides can be linked by an O- (an O-glycoside), N- (a glycosylamine), S-(a thioglycoside), or C- (a C-glycoside) glycosidic bond. According to the IUPAC the name "C-glycoside" is a misnomer, the preferred term is "C-glycosyl compound".[tpl]cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/G02661.html|title=IUPAC Gold Book - Glycosides[/tpl]  The given definition is the one used by IUPAC, which recommends the Haworth projection to correctly assign stereochemical configurations. Many authors require in addition that the sugar be bonded to a non-sugar for the molecule to qualify as a glycoside, thus excluding polysaccharides. The sugar group is then known as the glycone and the non-sugar group as the aglycone or genin part of the glycoside. The glycone can consist of a single sugar group (monosaccharide) or several sugar groups (oligosaccharide).
The first glycoside ever identified was amygdalin, by the French chemists Pierre Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard, in 1830.[tpl]cite journal |title=[tpl]lang|fr|Nouvelles expériences sur les amandes amères et sur l'huile volatile qu'elles fournissent[/tpl] |last=Robiquet |last2=Boutron-Charlard |journal=Annales de chimie et de physique |volume=44 |year=1830 |issue= |pages=352–382 |doi= |pmid= [/tpl]

[[Voiceless alveolar stop]]

CATEGORIES: Alveolar consonants

The voiceless alveolar stop is a type of consonantal sound used in many spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents voiceless dental, alveolar, and postalveolar stops is [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|t[/tpl][/tpl], and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is t. The dental stop can be distinguished with the underbridge diacritic, [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|t̪[/tpl][/tpl], the postalveolar with a retraction line, [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|t̠[/tpl][/tpl], and the Extensions to the IPA have a double underline diacritic which can be used to explicitly specify an alveolar pronunciation, [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|t͇[/tpl][/tpl].

Helmut Hirsch (January 27, 1916 in Stuttgart – June 4, 1937 in Berlin) was a German Jew who was executed for his part in a bombing plot intended to destabilize the German Reich. Although a full and accurate account of the plot is unknown, his targets were understood to be the Nazi party headquarters in Nuremberg, Germany, and/or the plant where the antisemitic weekly propaganda newspaper Der Stürmer was printed.[ref]The day after his execution, the New York Times put the story on its front page. The 2000-word article, datelined Berlin, June 4, gives a detailed summary of the case. "Germans Execute Hirsch, U. S. Citizen; Youth of 21 Guillotined Despite Repeated American Appeals to Hitler for Clemency." New York Times, June 5, 1937, page 1. In addition, William Shirer provides an account in Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934–1941 (New York: Knopf, 1941; pp. 74–76.) Many of the details reported by the Times and Shirer are at odds with other sources, including the dossier containing the "Case of Helmut Hirsch." (note 6) and the recollections of Hirsch's sister (note 2), as well as documents written by or related to Hirsch held in the Robert D. Farber University Archives and Special Collections Department at Brandeis University. http://lts.brandeis.edu/research/archives-speccoll/collections/mancoll.html No one reporting the story had access to these sources at the time. Nonetheless, the contemporary version of the events was for many years all that was available in English. 
In 2004, the German weekly magazine Stern ran a cover story about the von Stauffenberg plot and other attempts on Hitler's life. A timeline (page 66) of failed plots to kill or unseat Hitler begins with Hirsch: "December 1936: The Jewish student Helmut Hirsch plans to blow up the Nürnberg Party headquarters. He was executed on June 4, 1937." "20. Juli 1944: Das Attentat auf Hitler: Operation Walküre. " Stern. July 1, 2004, pages 47–68. http://www.stern.de/politik/historie/503288.html?eid=526246[/ref]
Hirsch was the elder of the two children of Marta Neuburger Hirsch and Siegfried Hirsch.
In 1935, after the newly introduced antisemitic Nuremberg Laws excluded the Jews from German universities, he moved to Prague, the capital of what was then Czechoslovakia. He was nineteen when he enrolled as a student of architecture at the Deutsche Technische Hochschule (German Institute of Technology) there.[ref]Details of Helmut Hirsch's family, his life prior to his arrest, and subsequent efforts to save his life were obtained from his sister, Kaete (Katie Sugarman), through a series of interviews and an account she wrote in 1962. Documents, including Hirsch's journal and letters he wrote before his arrest and, from prison, after he was sentenced to death, are in the Robert D. Farber University Archives and Special Collections Department at Brandeis University. Most are in German; some have been translated into English.

[[Longhorn beetle]]

CATEGORIES: Cerambycidae, Insect families

The longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae; also known as long-horned beetles or longicorns) are a cosmopolitan family of beetles, typically characterized by extremely long antennae, which are often as long as or longer than the beetle's body. In various members of the family, however, the antennae are quite short (e.g., Neandra brunnea, figured below) and such species can be difficult to distinguish from related beetle families such as Chrysomelidae. The family is large, with over 20,000 species described, slightly more than half from the Eastern Hemisphere. Several are serious pests. The larvae, called roundheaded borers, bore into wood, where they can cause extensive damage to either living trees or untreated lumber (or, occasionally, to wood in buildings; the old-house borer, Hylotrupes bajulus, being a particular problem indoors). A number of species mimic ants, bees, and wasps, though a majority of species are cryptically colored. The rare titan beetle (Titanus giganteus) from northeastern South America is often considered the largest (though not the heaviest, and not the longest including legs) insect, with a maximum known body length of just over [tpl]convert|16.7|cm[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |author=Max Barclay |year=2010 |title=Titanus giganteus Linnaeus (1771) |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/biodiversity/loss-of-habitat/titanus-giganteus/index.html |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |publisher=Natural History Museum[/tpl]

USS ''Conyngham'' (DDG-17), the third ship named for Captain Gustavus Conyngham USN (1744–1819), was a Charles F. Adams-class guided missile armed destroyer in the United States Navy.
Conyngham was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 1 May 1961, launched on 19 May 1962 by Mrs. Carl B. Albert, wife of Representative Albert of Oklahoma, House Majority Leader and commissioned on 13 June 1963, Commander Edwin P. Smith in command.
The USS Conyngham, nicknamed The Gus Boat, was unique in that it was only one of three naval warships with shamrocks on her stacks (the others being the [tpl]USS|Coral Sea|CV-43[/tpl] and the [tpl]USS|The Sullivans|DD-537[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl] During her 27 years of commissioned service, Conyngham lived up to her motto, Ready to Serve. Her presence exerted a powerful influence during times of crisis and helped maintain peace as a component of NATO seapower throughout the Cold War period. Conyngham made 15 Mediterranean deployments—three to the Persian Gulf, seven to Northern Europe, and 11 deployments to the Caribbean. She distinguished herself during crises in Cyprus (1964, 1974); provided air cover for planes evacuating Americans from an insurrection in Amman, Jordan (1970); took part in contingency operations during the Arab-Israeli Yom-Kippur War (1973); was the escort combatant during the evacuation of Americans from Beirut, Lebanon (1976); and conducted Black Sea Freedom of Navigation operations (1979).
During the 1980s, Conyngham continued to support United States foreign policy when she served off the coast of Libya (1982); was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for providing naval gunfire support of Marines stationed in, and off the coast of, Beirut, Lebanon (1983) and monitored maritime traffic off the coast of Nicaragua (1983). She sailed with the [tpl]USS|America|CV-66[/tpl] Baffle Group in support of U. S. intervention forces in Grenada (1983). While deployed to the Caribbean in 1986, Conyngham was credited with four drug interdictions and was awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation Medal.
Conyngham continued superior performance as she escorted U. S. Flagged merchant shipping through the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War in 1987 in Operation Earnest Will. During that deployment she sortied from Bahrain on short notice and provided assistance to [tpl]USS|Stark|FFG-31[/tpl] after she was hit by two anti-ship missiles launched by an Iraqi F-1 Mirage. Conyngham was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her efforts in saving the crippled ship. In 1988, Conyngham continue the Gus Can Do tradition during her deployments to the Fjords of Norway and Northern Europe. She completed her fifteenth Mediterranean deployment and received her fourth Battle Efficiency "E" in 1989 while part of the [tpl]USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71[/tpl] battlegroup.

The Vatican Secret Archives ([tpl]lang-la|Archivum Secretum Apostolicum Vaticanum[/tpl]), located in Vatican City, is the central repository for all of the acts promulgated by the Holy See. The Pope, having primal incumbency until death or resignation, owns the archives until the next appointed Papal successor. The archives also contain the state papers, correspondence, papal account books,See Pastor, History of the Popes, vol. III, 31. and many other documents which the church has accumulated over the centuries. In the 17th century, under the orders of Pope Paul V, the Secret Archives were separated from the Vatican Library, where scholars had some very limited access to them, and remained absolutely closed to outsiders until 1881, when Pope Leo XIII opened them to researchers, more than a thousand of whom now examine its documents each year.Table of Admittances to the Vatican Secret Archives in the Last Years ([tpl]WayBack|http://asv.vatican.va/en/fond/ammiss.htm|date=20110506021633[/tpl])
The use of the word "secret" in the title "Vatican Secret Archives" does not denote the modern meaning of confidentiality. Its meaning is closer to that of the word "private", indicating that the archives are the Pope's personal property, not belonging to those of any particular department of the Roman Curia or the Holy See. The word "secret" was generally used in this sense as also reflected in phrases such as "secret servants", "secret cupbearer", "secret carver", or "secretary", much like an esteemed position of honor and regard comparable to a VIP.The Title "Vatican Secret Archives"

At the time of his initial retirement, he also ranked second in career triples (205), and third in runs batted in (1,296) and hits.Brouthers is credited with differing totals in career hits; at the time, he was credited with 2,349 hits, a figure still recognized by Major League Baseball, but this total includes 71 walks in 1887, when walks were counted as hits. There are slight variations in other seasons as well, but most sources today credit Brouthers with 2,296 hits.
A dominating hitter during the prime of his career, he led (or was in the top of) the league in most offensive categories, including batting average, runs scored, runs batted in (RBI), on-base percentage and hits. He led the league in batting average five times, the most by a 19th-century player, and his career .342 batting average still ranks ninth all-time. Brouthers is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date who have appeared in Major League games in four decades.
He was also an active players' union member, and was elected vice president of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players. Brouthers was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 by the Veterans Committee.

The product sold as "black lentil" is usually the whole urad bean or urad dal.  The product sold as "white lentil" is the same lentil with the black skin removed.
Black gram originated in India, where it has been in cultivation from ancient times and is one of the most highly prized pulses of India and Pakistan. The coastal Andhra region in Andhra Pradesh is famous for black gram after paddy. The Guntur District ranks first in Andhra Pradesh for the production of black gram.

USS ''Buchanan'' (DDG-14), named for Admiral Franklin Buchanan, was a Charles F. Adams class guided missile armed destroyer in the United States Navy.
Buchanan was laid down by Todd-Pacific Shipbuilding at Seattle in Washington on 23 April 1959, launched on 11 May 1960 and commissioned on 7 February 1962. She was commissioned by the Commandant, Thirteenth Naval District, Rear Admiral George C. Towner.USS Buchanan DDG14.org
In April 1962, she arrived in her home port of San Diego for the first time.USS Buchanan DDG14.org Shakedown training included a visit to Pearl Harbor and taking part in the USS Arizona Monument Dedication of May 31, 1962. A year later, in May 1963, she toured  Australia, stopping at several cities to allow the public to board, so the Australian people could see what the U.S. guided missile destroyers looked like that they were purchasing. In June 1963 she was credited with providing medical attention that saved the life of a Chinese sailor (Yunglai Chu) aboard a National Chinese merchant union carrier.
In 1965 Buchanan, along with the other three destroyers of Destroyer Division 152 (COMDESDIV 152) steamed north of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) many times at night on reconnaissance missions. These were the first US naval missions north of the DMZ since the Gulf of Tonkin incidents of early August 1964.
In February 1985, a port visit request by the United States for the Buchanan was refused by New Zealand, as the Buchanan was capable of launching nuclear depth bomb equipped ASROCs. Following the victory of the New Zealand Labour Party led by David Lange at elections in 1984, the Parliament of New Zealand enacted a law which barred nuclear powered or nuclear armed ships from using New Zealand ports, citing the dangers of nuclear weapons and continued nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Given that the United States Navy refused to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard ships, these laws in effect refused access to New Zealand ports for all ships of the United States Navy.
After consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States announced that it was suspending its ANZUS treaty obligations to New Zealand until United States Navy ships were readmitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was "a friend, but not an ally".
Buchanan was decommissioned on 1 October 1991, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sunk as a target off Hawaii on 14 June 2000.

He rose to prominence as a founding member of the band White Zombie which formed in the mid-1980s and rose to fame in the early 1990s. As a solo artist, he has released five studio albums, five compilation albums, and a live album. He expanded his career and became a director, and has directed a total of six films, the majority of which he also wrote or co-wrote. He has also released numerous brands of comic books, and appeared as an actor on numerous occasions.
White Zombie's debut album, Soul-Crusher, was released in 1987 and was followed by their second album Make Them Die Slowly in 1989. They rose to prominence after the success of their third album, La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1, and its lead single "Thunder Kiss '65" in 1993. The album went on to be certified multi-platinum by the RIAA, for sales exceeding two million copies in the US. Their fourth and final studio album, Astro-Creep: 2000, became their first top-10 entry on the Billboard 200, and their second album to reach multi-platinum status. Zombie began his solo career with the release of his 1998 debut album Hellbilly Deluxe. The album was both a critical and commercial success, spawning three hit singles, reaching the Top 5 of the Billboard 200, and selling over three million copies worldwide. Hellbilly is Zombie's highest selling album to date. He followed the success of the album with The Sinister Urge in 2001, which had similar success to that of its predecessor. Zombie's first greatest hits album, Past, Present & Future, was released in 2003, and reached Platinum status by the RIAA. His third studio album, Educated Horses, was released in 2006, and was his third Top 10 entry on the Billboard 200. In 2010, he released Hellbilly Deluxe 2, calling it a companion to his debut album. His fifth album, Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor, was released on April 23, 2013.
Following his success as a musician, Zombie began directing, writing and producing films. His first film, House of 1000 Corpses, was completed in 2000, but numerous struggles with the distributor over the film's violence and gore ultimately led to the film not being released until 2003. Its sequel, The Devil's Rejects, was released in 2005. In 2007, he released his third film, a remake of the 1978 classic film Halloween. The film went on to gross over $80 million, the highest-grossing film in the Halloween franchise. In 2009, Zombie released a sequel for the film, titled Halloween II. In 2009, Zombie released his first animated film, The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, based on his comic book series of the same name. His film The Lords of Salem was released in 2013. Zombie bought the rights to a film about the Philadelphia Flyers, titled The Broad Street Bullies, though no release date for the film has been announced yet.
Zombie directed the majority of his band White Zombie's music videos, as well as numerous videos of his own. Zombie's lyrics are noted for their horror and sci-fi themes, and his live shows for their elaborate shock rock theatricality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://film.list.co.uk/article/32670-shock-rocker-and-horror-film-director-rob-zombie-full-interview-transcript/|title=Shock Rocker and Horror Film Director Rob Zombie Full Interview| publisher= Film.list.co.uk| accessdate= 2012-04-30[/tpl] He has sold over 15 million albums worldwide, and had six Top 20 hits on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the United States.[tpl]cite web|author=Zombie Live |url=http://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Live-Rob/dp/B000SUKPTS |title=Zombie Live: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-22[/tpl]

[[European badger]]

CATEGORIES: Badgers, Mammals of Europe, Mammals of Azerbaijan, Mammals of Iran, Mammals of Asia, Megafauna of Eurasia, Mammals of Israel, Animals described in 1758

The European badger (Meles meles) is a species of badger in the family Mustelidae and is native to almost all of Europe and some parts of the Middle East.  Several subspecies are recognised; the nominate subspecies (Meles meles meles) predominates over most of Europe.  The European badger is classified as being of Least Concern by the IUCN as it has a wide range and a large population size which is stable, and even increasing in some areas.
The European badger is a powerfully built black, white and grey animal with a small head, a stocky body and short tail. Its weight varies, being 7–13 kg (15–29 lb) in spring but building up to 15–17 kg (33–37 lb) in autumn before the winter sleep period. It is nocturnal and is a social, burrowing animal that sleeps during the day in one of several setts in its territorial range.  These burrows, which may house several badger families, have extensive systems of underground passages and chambers and have multiple entrances.  Some setts have been in use for decades.  Badgers are very fussy over the cleanliness of their burrow, carrying in fresh bedding and removing soiled material, and they defecate in latrines strategically situated around their territory.
Though classified as a carnivore, the European badger feeds on a wide variety of plant and animal foods.  The diet consists mainly of earthworms, large insects, small mammals, carrion, cereals and root tubers.  Litters of up to five cubs are produced in spring. The young are weaned a few months later but usually remain within the family group. The European badger is generally a peaceful animal, having been known to share its burrow with other species such as rabbits, red foxes and raccoon dogs, but it can be ferocious when provoked, a trait which has been exploited in the now illegal blood sport of badger-baiting.  Although it does not usually prey on domestic stock, the badger is believed to be harmful to livestock through the spread of bovine tuberculosis, a disease to which it is prone.

Télé-Québec is a French language public educational television network in the Canadian province of Quebec. Known legally as  Société de télédiffusion du Québec (Quebec Television Broadcasting Corporation), it is a provincial crown corporation owned by the Government of Quebec. The network's main studios and general offices are located in Montreal, at the corner of Saint Catherine and Fullum Streets in Downtown Montreal.
Télé-Québec is equivalent to Ontario's TVOntario and TFO, and British Columbia's Knowledge, and similar to the US PBS network, in that it is somewhat modest in scope, runs mostly educational or cultural programming, and does not try to compete with privately owned television networks or with the Radio-Canada television network owned and operated by the federal government. The network also runs commercials during its programming, not unlike its federal counterparts Radio-Canada and CBC Television. The latter, by contrast, does strongly compete with private networks and overlaps with their programming categories.
All programming on Télé-Québec is in French, though there are a few shows and movies that are presented in the original language (predominantly English), with French subtitles.
Télé-Québec operates local offices in Val-d'Or, Trois-Rivières, Rimouski, Gatineau, Sept-Îles, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay and Carleton-sur-Mer.
Télé-Québec is one of the partners in the TV5 Québec Canada and TV5MONDE consortiums. It also had a 25% stake in the French-Canadian arts specialty channel, ARTV, which it sold to the CBC in 2010.

The Nezamiyeh ([tpl]lang-tr|Nizamiye Medresesi[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fa|نظامیه[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ar|النظامیة[/tpl]) are a group of the medieval institutions of higher education established by Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk in the eleventh century in  Iran. The name nizamiyyah derives from his name. Founded at the beginning of the Seljuk empire, these Sunni Islam theological schools are considered to be the model of madrasahs, or Islamic religious schools.Ed(s). "al- Niẓāmiyya , al- Madrasa." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010, retrieved 20(03/2010)
Nizamiyyah institutes were the first well organized institutions of higher learning in the Muslim world. The quality of education was the highest in the Islamic world, and they were even renowned in Europe. They were supported financially, politically, and spiritually by the royal establishment and the elite class. Some scholars have suggested that the establishment of the Nizamiyya madrasas was in fact an attempt to thwart the growing influence of another group of Muslims, the Ismailis, in the region. Indeed, Nizam al-Mulk devoted a significant section in his famous Books of Politics (Siyāsatnāma) to refuting the Ismaili doctrines.Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 73.
The most famous and celebrated of all the nizamiyyah schools was Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad (established 1065), where Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk appointed the distinguished philosopher and theologian, al-Ghazali, as a professor.  Persian poet Sa'di was a student of the Baghdad Nizamiyyah.  Other nizamiyyah schools were located in Nishapur, Amol, Balkh, Herat and Isfahan.
Nizam ul-Mulk was finally assassinated en route from Isfahan to Baghdad in 1092 CE. According to several books, he was assassinated by a member of Hashshashin, a group of the Ismaili sect of Shi'a Islam.
According to Mughatil ibn Bakri, a staff member of the Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad, he alleges that Nizam al-Mulk converted to Shia Islam after a Sunni-Shia debate held on the orders of Sultan Malik Shah I, who also converted to Shia'ism. But it is thereafter that they were both assassinated.Mughatil ibn Bakri, In search of Truth in Baghdad (در جستجوی حق در بغداد), also appearing under the title "راهي به سوي حقيقت", ISBN 964-93287-8-5, p.134-136. Link to item in publisher's catalog: http://www.iran-books.com/Book/detail.asp?key=5-8-93287-964 This narration is disputed, however, by most historians and Sunni scholars.

The International Workers' Association (IWA) ([tpl]lang-es|AIT - Asociación Internacional de los Trabajadores[/tpl], [tpl]lang-de|IAA-Internationale ArbeiterInnen Assoziation[/tpl]) is an international federation of anarcho-syndicalist labor unions and initiatives.
Based on the principles of revolutionary unionism,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.iwa-ait.org/content/statutes|title=The Statutes of Revolutionary Unionism (IWA)|publisher=IWA|accessdate=2013-10-13[/tpl] the international aims to create unions capable of fighting for the economic and political interests of the working class and eventually, to directly abolish capitalism through "the establishment of economic communities and administrative organs run by the workers."
At its peak the International represented millions of people worldwide. Its member unions played a central role in the social conflicts of the 1920s and 30s. However the International was formed as many countries were entering periods of extreme repression, and many of the largest IWA unions were shattered during that period.Vadim Damier (2009), Anarcho-syndicalism in the 20th Century
As a result, by the end of World War II all but one of the International's branches, had ceased to function as unions, a slump which continued throughout the 1940s and 50s. It would not be until the late 1970s, with the death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, that it would see a major union, the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) reform within its ranks.
After the 1970s, the International expanded and currently counts 14 member sections and 4 Friends.

[[Devotional song]]
CATEGORIES: Religious music, Song forms

A devotional song is a hymn which accompanies religious observances and rituals.
Each major religion has its own tradition with devotional hymns. In the West, the devotional has been a part of the liturgy in Roman Catholicism, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, and others, since their earliest days. A devotional is a part of the prayer service proper and is not, in these contexts, ornamentation.  During the Protestant Reformation, church music in general was hotly debated. Some Puritans objected to all ornament and sought to abolish choirs, hymns, and, inasmuch as liturgy itself was rejected, devotionals.
In Eastern and Near-Eastern religions, devotionals can function as communion prayer and meditation. These are sung in particular rhythms which are sustained over a prolonged period to give practitioners a mystical experience.

[[Political convention]]
CATEGORIES: Political party assemblies, Conventions (meetings)

In politics, a political convention is a meeting of a political party, typically to select party candidates.  
In the United States, a political convention usually refers to a presidential nominating convention, but it can also refer to state, county, or congressional district nominating conventions. In Canada, a political convention held to choose a party leader is often known as a leadership convention. The new leader of a party may then become prime minister.
Outside of the United States and Canada, national meetings of political parties are often called party congresses, or party conferences, as in the United Kingdom.
The first political convention held in America took place in Hartford, Connecticut in March 1766.  The meeting was organized by the Sons of Liberty, who, in challenging incumbent governor Thomas Fitch, nominated William Pitkin for governor and Jonathan Trumbull for deputy governor.

[[Space-cadet keyboard]]
CATEGORIES: Computer keyboards

The space-cadet keyboard is a keyboard used on MIT Lisp machines and designed by Tom Knight, which inspired several still-current jargon terms in the field of computer science and influenced the design of Emacs. It was inspired by the Knight keyboard (also developed by Tom Knight), which was developed for the Knight TV system, used with MIT's Incompatible Timesharing System.
The Symbolics-labeled version shown here was only used with the LM-2, which was Symbolics's repackaged version of the MIT CADR. Later Symbolics systems used a greatly simplified keyboard that retained only the basic layout and the more commonly used function and control keys from the space-cadet keyboard.

[[Shloka]]
CATEGORIES: Sanskrit, Hindu texts, Poetic rhythm, Indian poetics

A [tpl]IAST|śloka[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-sa|श्लोक[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sa|ˈɕloːkə|IPA[/tpl]; also anglicized as shloka or sloka, meaning "song", from the root śru, "hear"Macdonell, Arthur A., A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 232(Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927).) is a category of verse line developed from the Vedic Anustubh. It is the basis for Indian epic verse, and may be considered the Indian verse form par excellence, occurring, as it does, far more frequently than any other meter in classical Sanskrit poetry.Macdonell, Arthur A., A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 232(Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927). The Mahabharata and Ramayana, for example, are written almost exclusively in shlokas. The traditional view is that this form of verse occurred to Valmiki, the author of the Ramayana, on seeing a hunter shoot down one of two birds in love.
The shloka is treated as a couplet.  Each hemistich (half-verse) of 16 syllables, composed of two Pādas of eight syllables, can take either a pathyā ("normal") form or one of several vipulā ("extended") forms. The form of the second foot of the first Pāda (II) limits the possible patterns the first foot (I) may assume, as in the scheme below.
The Pathyā and Vipulā half-verses are arranged in the table above in order of frequency of occurrence. Out of 2579 half-verses taken from Kalidasa, Magha, Bharavi, and Bilhana, each of the four admissible forms of shloka in the above order claims the following share: 2289, 116, 89, 85.Macdonell, Arthur A., A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 233(Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927)  
The metrical constraints on a hemistich in terms of its two constituent padas are as follows:Steiner, Appendix 4; translated: Macdonald, Appendix
Noteworthy is the avoidance of an iambic cadence in the first pāda.  By comparison, Syllables 5-7 of any pāda in the old Vedic anuṣṭubh is typically a ja-gaṇa ("⏑ – ⏑"), or a dijambus.
An example of an anuṣṭubh stanza which fails the classical requirements of a shloka is from the Shatapatha Brahmana

Tulsidas ([tpl]IPA-hns|t̪ʊls̪iːd̪aːs̪|hi[/tpl], also known as Goswami Tulsidas; 1497/1532–1623) was a Hindu poet-saint, reformer and philosopher renowned for his devotion to the god Rama. A composer of several popular works, he is best known as the author of the epic Ramcharitmanas, a retelling of the Sanskrit Ramayana in the vernacular Awadhi. Tulsidas was acclaimed in his lifetime to be a reincarnation of Valmiki, the composer of the original Ramayana in Sanskrit.Lutgendorf 2007, p. 293. He is also considered to be the composer of the Hanuman Chalisa, a popular devotional hymn dedicated to Hanuman, the divine devotee of Rama.Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 306. Tulsidas spent most of his life in the city of Varanasi.Prasad 2008, p. 857, quoting Mata Prasad Gupta: Although he paid occasional visits to several places of pilgrimage associated with Rama, his permanent residence was in Kashi.

One could scarcely attend a public or private religious function in Banaras that year without hearing, over the obligatory loudspeaker system, the familiar strains of Murli Manohar Svarup's orchestration and Mukesh's mellifluous chanting.Lutgendorf 1991, p. 411–412: On January 25, 1987, a new program premiered on India's government-run television network, Doordarshan... it was the first time that television was used to present a serialized adaption of a religious epic. The chosen work was the Ramayan and the major source for the screenplay was the Manas. Long before the airing of the main story concluded on July 31, 1988, the Ramayan had become the most popular program ever shown on Indian television, drawing an estimated one hundred million viewers and generating unprecedented advertising revenues. Throughout much of the country, activities came to a halt on Sunday mornings and streets and bazaars took on a deserted look, as people gathered before their own and neighbors' TV sets.... The phenomenal impact of the Ramayan serial merits closer examination than it can be given here, but it is clear that the production and the response it engendered once again dramatized the role of the epic as a principal medium not only for individual and collective religious experience but also for public discourse and social and cultural reflection.

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Sporting dogs, Dog breeds originating in Germany

The German shorthaired pointer (GSP) is a breed of dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]
The breed is streamlined yet powerful with strong legs that make it able to move rapidly and turn quickly. It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. Its muzzle is long, broad, and strong, allowing it to retrieve even heavy game. The dog's profile should be straight or strongly Roman nosed; any dished appearance to the profile is incorrect.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The eyes are generally brown, with darker eyes being desirable; yellow or "bird of prey" eyes are a fault. The tail is commonly docked, although this is now prohibited in some countries. The correct location for docking for GSP is after the caudal vertebrae start to curl, leaving enough tail to let the dog communicate through tail wagging and movement.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The docked tail should not be too long or too short but should balance the appearance of the head and body. The GSP tail is carried at a jaunty angle, not curled under. When the GSP is in classic point stance, the tail should be held straight out from the body forming a line with the pointing head and body. Like all German pointers, GSP have webbed feet.They are known for going after water fowl in the water.

Wood advocated a summer training school for reserve officers to be held in Plattsburg, New York.
The movement was originally opposed by President Woodrow Wilson, who believed the United States should be in a position of armed neutrality.  Several organizations were formed around the Preparedness Movement and held parades and organized opposition to Wilson's policies.  After the Lusitania was sunk by German U-boats on May 7, 1915 and Pancho Villa launched his raid against Columbus, New Mexico, Wilson's attitude changed.Link, 1972  Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916 in June 1916 to authorize an enormous increase in the size of the military, and the Preparedness Movement faded.[tpl]cite journal|title=James Hay and the Preparedness Controversy, 1915-1916|journal=The Journal of Southern History|date=1964-11-04|first=George|last=Herring|coauthors=|volume=30|issue=4|pages=383–404|id= |format=|accessdate=2008-12-04|doi=10.2307/2204278|publisher=Southern Historical Association|jstor=2204278 [/tpl]

[tpl]nihongo|Fist of the North Star|北斗の拳|Hokuto no Ken[/tpl][tpl]nihongo|Hokuto|北斗[/tpl] is the Japanese name of the Big Dipper constellation, which literally means the "Northern Ladle". is a Japanese manga series written by Buronson and drawn by Tetsuo Hara that was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1983 to 1988, spanning 245 chapters, which were initially collected in a 27-volume tankōbon edition by Shueisha. Set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been destroyed by a nuclear war, the story centers around a warrior named Kenshiro, the successor of a deadly martial art style known as Hokuto Shinken, which gives him the ability to kill most adversaries from within through the use of the human body's secret vital points, often resulting in an exceptionally violent and gory death. Kenshiro dedicates his life to fighting against the various ravagers who threaten the lives of the weak and innocent, as well as rival martial artists, including his own "brothers" from the same clan.
The manga was adapted into an anime TV series produced by Toei Animation which aired on Fuji TV affiliates from 1984 through 1988, comprising a combined total of 152 episodes. Several films, OVAs, and video games had been produced as well, including a series of spin-offs centering around other characters from the original story.
The original manga was republished in English by Viz Communications as a monthly comic book, and later by Gutsoon! Entertainment as a series of colorized graphic novels, although neither translations were completed. English adaptations of other Fist of the North Star media have also been licensed to other companies, including the TV series and the original 1986 film.

[[Low-key lighting]]
CATEGORIES: Photographic techniques, Cinematography

Low-key lighting is a style of lighting for photography, film or television. It is a necessary element in creating a chiaroscuro effect. Traditional photographic lighting, three-point lighting uses a key light, a fill light, and a back light for illumination. Low-key lighting often uses only one key light, optionally controlled with a fill light or a simple reflector. 
Low key light accentuates the contours of an object by throwing areas into shade while a fill light or reflector may illuminate the shadow areas to control contrast. The relative strength of key-to-fill, known as the lighting ratio, can be measured using a light meter. Low key lighting has a higher lighting ratio, e.g. 8:1, than high-key lighting, which can approach 1:1.  
The term "low key" is used in cinematography to refer to any scene with a high lighting ratio, especially if there is a predominance of shadowy areas. It tends to heighten the sense of alienation felt by the viewer, hence is commonly used in film noir and horror genres.

CATEGORIES: 1586 births, 1635 deaths, People from King's Lynn, Newfoundland colonial leaders, Alumni of Peterhouse, Cambridge, 17th-century cartographers

Captain John Mason (1586–1635) was a sailor and colonizer born at King's Lynn, Norfolk, England, and educated at Peterhouse College, Cambridge.[tpl]acad|id=M602J|name=Mason, John[/tpl] He was appointed the second Proprietary Governor of Newfoundland's Cuper's Cove colony in 1615, succeeding John Guy. Mason arrived on the island in 1616 and explored much of the territory. He compiled a map of the island and wrote and published a short tract (or "Discourse") of his findings.
Mason drew up the first known English map of the island of Newfoundland. Published in William Vaughan's Cambrensium Caroleia in 1625, the map included previously established placenames as well as new ones such as Bristol's Hope and Butter Pots, near Renews. His tract entitled A Briefe Discourse of the New-Found-Land with the situation, temperature, and commodities thereof, inciting our nation to go forward in the hopefull plantation begunne, was published in 1620 by Mason while in England.
In 1620 King James I's Privy Council issued Mason a commission and provided him with a ship to suppress piracy in Newfoundland. Mason ceased to be Cuper's Cove governor in 1621 and apparently he was not replaced, although the settlement continued to be occupied throughout the seventeenth century.
Upon returning to England, Mason consulted with Sir William Alexander about possibly colonizing Nova Scotia. In 1622, Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges received a patent from the Council for New England for all the territory lying between the Merrimack and Kennebec rivers.Burrage, Henry S. The Beginnings of Colonial Maine, 1602-1658. Marks Printing House (1914), p. 166-67. In 1629 they divided the grant along the Piscataqua River, with Mason receiving the southern portion. The colony was recharted as the Province of New Hampshire. It included most of the southeastern part of the current state of New Hampshire, as well as portions of present-day Massachusetts north of the Merrimack.
Although Mason never set foot in New England, he was appointed first vice-admiral of New England in 1635. He died that same year while preparing for his first voyage to the new colony.

The District of Columbia statehood movement is a political movement that advocates making the District of Columbia a U.S. state. As the national capital, Washington, D.C. is a federal district under the direct jurisdiction of the United States Congress. Statehood would grant the District voting representation in the Congress and full control over local affairs. If achieved, the new state would be named New Columbia.
Statehood for the District could potentially be achieved by an act of Congress using the power granted under Article Four, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution. However, there is some debate as to whether simple legislation would be sufficient to grant statehood to the seat of government.

Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn officially designated the area as Chinatown in October 1999 and it continues to grow as the Asian population in Las Vegas expands rapidly.  The Chinatown area has gained much popularity, receiving national attention in a 2004 article by The Wall Street Journal (See Further Reading below for the specific citation).

LGBT adoption is the adoption of children by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. This may be in the form of a joint adoption by a same-sex couple, adoption by one partner of a same-sex couple of the other's biological child (step-parent adoption) and adoption by a single LGBT person.
Adoption by same-sex couples is legal in 14 countries and in some territories. Opponents of LGBT adoption question whether same-sex couples have the ability to be adequate parents (see LGBT parenting). Since constitutions and statutes usually fail to address the adoption rights of LGBT persons, judicial decisions often determine whether they can serve as parents either individually or as couples.

Other regions, such as Tripura, and the Barak Valley region of Assam (in India) also have large native Bengali populations and share this cuisine. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet, Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the Indian subcontinent that is analogous in structure to the modern service à la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.

CATEGORIES: Film festivals in Australia, International film festivals, Recurring events established in 1993, Short film festivals, Festivals in Sydney, Tropfest

Tropfest is the world's largest short film festival. It has also become known as the world's first truly global film festival.
Tropfest began in 1993 as a screening for 200 people in a cafe in Sydney but has since become the largest platform for short films in the world. Tropfest Australia takes place in February each year and is broadcast live to an audience of approximately 150,000. The main event takes place in Sydney[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydney.com/events|title=Sydney Events|publisher=Sydney.com|accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl] but live satellite events are also staged in Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Perth and other cities. The event is broadcast live on television and webcast to viewers around Australia and the world.
Tropfest has expanded to cities around the world including Abu Dhabi, London, Berlin, Toronto, Bangkok, and New York. The inaugural Tropfest Arabia, encompassing approximately 33 countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa, took place in Abu Dhabi in November 2011. Tropfest launched into the United States in June 2012, with a weekend-long event in Las Vegas and a fully-fledged Tropfest New York competition in New York on 23 June 2012 at Manhattan's Bryant Park. Tropfest New Zealand will take place for the first time in 2013 & Tropfest South East Asia at Penang, Malaysia in 2014
Tropfest distinguishes itself from other events by being a "content generation" platform, rather than merely an exhibition platform. Filmmakers are required to create new works for the festival which must include an item, known as the "Tropfest Signature Item" (TSI) and which changes each year. The films must be less than 7 minutes (including titles and credits) and be world premieres at the Tropfest event. 
Tropfest's prize pool is one of the richest in the short film arena, and includes international trips to develop filmmaking careers and "work experience" with top filmmakers. As a result, Tropfest has become known as the undisputed premiere launch pad for filmmaking careers, although to date this has been most notable in Australia, where many commercial and critical successes are directed by Tropfest alumni.

Sri Lanka is a tropical island situated close to the southern tip of India. The bird life of Sri Lanka is very rich for its size, and about 433 species have been recorded. In addition to the many resident birds, a considerable number of migratory species winter in the country to escape their northern breeding grounds.
233 species are resident, of which the most important are the 26 Endemic.The other resident species are also found in the adjacent Indian mainland, but over 80 have developed distinct Sri Lankan races. Some of these races are very different in their plumage characteristics from the related forms in India.
Bird distribution in Sri Lanka is largely determined by its climatic zones. The dry zone is largest of the three, covering more than half of the area of the island, with a prolonged dry and hot period and only one monsoon (the northeast monsoon from October to January).
The wet zone, with two monsoons, is in the southwestern quarter of the island, where the few remaining rain forests are found and humidity is high.
The central hill zone rises to over 2450 m (8-10,000 ft) and has a cool temperate climate. Most of the 26 endemic species are confined to the wet and the hill zones, with only a few extending into the dry zone as well.
Recent updates and sighting information can be obtained through the Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka web site.

In linear algebra, a Hessenberg matrix is a special kind of square matrix, one that is "almost" triangular. To be exact, an upper Hessenberg matrix has zero entries below the first subdiagonal, and a lower Hessenberg matrix has zero entries above the first superdiagonal.[tpl]harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985[/tpl], page 28; [tpl]harvtxt|Stoer|Bulirsch|2002[/tpl], page 251 They are named after Karl Hessenberg.Biswa Nath Datta (2010) Numerical Linear Algebra and Applications, 2nd Ed., Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) ISBN 978-0-89871-685-6, p. 307

Pak Tea House is an intellectual tea–café located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Traditionally frequented by country's notably artistic, cultural and literary personalities, it was founded by a Sikh family in 1940 and quickly acquired its current name in after leased to one of the locals in Lahore after the partition of India in 1947. Intervention of Lahore High Court and personal initiatives of Navaz Sharif led to the re-opening of the Tea House in 2013. Noted of being the birthplace of influential literary movement, the PWA, the place is described as "house of writers and thinkers who serve the nation selflessly."[tpl]cite news|last=APP|title=Nawaz reopens Pak Tea House in Lahore|url=http://dawn.com/2013/03/09/nawaz-reopens-pak-tea-house-in-lahore/|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=Dawn Newspapers|date=9 March 2013[/tpl]

[tpl]nihongo|Quarth|クオース[/tpl] is a hybrid puzzle game/shoot 'em up developed by Konami which was released in 1989 as an arcade game, sold as Block Hole outside Japan.
Besides the arcade version, there were also ports of the game to the MSX2 (with a built-in SCC chip), Famicom, and Game Boy—home releases used the Quarth name worldwide (with the exception of the Game Boy Color release in Europe of Konami GB Collection Vol. 2, where the game was renamed to the generic title Block Game for unknown reasons).
Quarth was released on the Konami Net i-mode service as Block Quarth, with an updated Block Quarth DX in 2001. It was released without the "DX" suffix in 2005, and was made globally available through Konami Net licensing on many i-mode services offered by mobile operators. In Europe, for example, it was available from O2 UK, O2 Ireland, and Telefónica Spain.
In 2005, Konami also included the game in the Nintendo DS title Ganbare Goemon: Tōkai Dōchū Ōedo Tengu ri Kaeshi no Maki. An emulated version of the game was released in 2006 for PlayStation 2 in Japan as part of the Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono-series.

The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, Act No 55 of 1949, was an apartheid law in South Africa that prohibited marriages between people of different races. It was among the first pieces of apartheid legislation to be passed following the National Party's rise to power in 1948. Subsequent legislation, especially the Population Registration and Immorality Acts of 1950, facilitated its implementation by requiring all individuals living in South Africa to register as a member of one of four officially defined racial groups and prohibiting extramarital sexual relationships between people of different races.

[[Domain-specific language]]

CATEGORIES: Domain-specific programming languages, Programming language classification

A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain. There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only a single piece of software. DSLs can be further subdivided by the kind of language, and include domain-specific markup languages, domain-specific modeling languages (more generally, specification languages), and domain-specific programming languages. Special-purpose computer languages have always existed in the computer age, but the term "domain-specific language" has become more popular due to the rise of domain-specific modeling. Simpler DSLs, particularly ones used by a single application, are sometimes informally called mini-languages.
The line between general-purpose languages and domain-specific languages is not always sharp, as a language may have specialized features for a particular domain but be applicable more broadly, or conversely may in principle be capable of broad application but in practice used primarily for a specific domain. For example, Perl was originally developed as a text-processing and glue language, for the same domain as AWK and shell scripts, but has since become a general-purpose programming language. By contrast, PostScript is a Turing complete language, and in principle can be used for any task, but in practice is narrowly used as a page description language.

Peter Joshua Sculthorpe AO OBE (born 29 April 1929) is an Australian composer.  Much of his music has resulted from an interest in the music of Australia's neighbours as well as from the impulse to bring together aspects of native Australian music with that of the heritage of the West. He is known primarily for his orchestral and chamber music, such as Kakadu (1988) and Earth Cry (1986), which evoke the sounds and feeling of the Australian bushland and outback. He has also written 17 string quartets, using unusual timbral effects, works for piano, and two operas.   He has stated that he wants his music to make people feel better and happier for having listened to it. He has typically avoided the dense, atonal techniques of many of his contemporary composers.  His work has often been distinguished by its distinctive use of percussion.

Hazuri Bagh ([tpl]lang-ur|[tpl]Nastaliq|حضوری باغ[/tpl][/tpl]) is a garden in Lahore, Pakistan, bounded by the Lahore Fort (east side), Badshahi Mosque (west side), the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh (north side) and the Roshnai Gate (south side). In the center stands the Hazuri Bagh Baradari, built by Ranjit Singh.
The Hazuri Bagh is a small enclosure between the Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort and eastern gate of the Badshahi Mosque. This garden was built by Maharajah Ranjit Singh in 1813 to celebrate the capture of the famous Koh-i-Noor Diamond from Shah Shujah of Afghanistan. The Serai Alamgiri formerly stood here.
The garden was planned and built under the supervision of Faqir Azizuddin in the traditional Mughal style layout. After its completion, it is said, Maharajah Ranjit Singh, at the suggestion of Jamadar Khushhal Singh, ordered that marble be removed from various mausoleums of Lahore to construct a baradari (pavilion) here. This task was given to Khalifa Nooruddin. Elegant carved marble pillars support the baradari’s delicate cusped arches. The central area, where Ranjit Singh held court, has a mirrored ceiling. Both the garden and the baradari, originally a 45-foot, three-storey  square with a basement approached by fifteen steps, suffered extensive damage during the fratricidal Sikh wars and was only reclaimed and laid out according to the original plan during the British period. On 19 July 1932, the uppermost story collapsed and was never reconstructed.
Every Sunday afternoon, people gather in the gardens to hear reciters recite traditional Punjabi Qisse, such as Heer Ranjha and Sassi Punnun, and other Punjabi Sufi poetry.
The tomb of Muhammad Iqbal lies across from the garden outside of the Badshahi Mosque.

Intelligence has been defined in many different ways such as in terms of one's capacity for logic, abstract thought, understanding, self-awareness, communication, learning, emotional knowledge, memory, planning, and problem solving.
Intelligence is most widely studied in humans, but has also been observed in animals and in plants.  Artificial intelligence is the simulation of intelligence in machines.
Within the discipline of psychology, various approaches to human intelligence have been adopted. The psychometric approach is especially familiar to the general public, as well as being the most researched and by far the most widely used in practical settings.[tpl]cite doi|10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77[/tpl] Article in Wikipedia: Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns

In recent years jegog has started to become popular in other regions of Bali with a few groups being established in central Bali to entertain tourists.  International interest has been spread by tourists visiting Bali and by recordings.  There are virtually no ensembles outside of Bali with the exception of at least two groups in Japan (http://www17.ocn.ne.jp/~sekar/index.htm Sekar Sakura and Geinoh Yamashirogumi, the latter's being used in 4 of the tracks to their score for the film Akira ), one in the United States (http://gsj.org Sekar Jaya Sekar Jaya) and one in  Germany.http://web.mac.com/niebauer/iWeb/Puspa-Kamala/Puspa-Kamala.html Puspa Kamala  Jegog music is very fast, loud, rhythmic and precise.

[[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]]
CATEGORIES: Algebraic numbers

In mathematics, a Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number, also called simply a Pisot number or a PV number, is a real algebraic integer greater than 1 such that all its Galois conjugates are less than 1 in absolute value. These numbers were discovered by Axel Thue in 1912 and rediscovered by G. H. Hardy in 1919 within the context of diophantine approximation. They became widely known after the publication of Charles Pisot's dissertation in 1938. The same condition also occurs in the uniqueness problem for Fourier series. Tirukkannapuram Vijayaraghavan and Raphael Salem continued their study in the 1940s. Salem numbers are a closely related set of numbers.
A characteristic property of PV numbers is that their powers approach integers at an exponential rate. Pisot proved a remarkable converse: if α > 1 is a real number such that the sequence
measuring the distance from its consecutive powers to the nearest integer is square-summable, or ℓ2, then α is a Pisot number (and, in particular, algebraic). Building on this characterization of PV numbers, Salem showed that the set S of all PV numbers is closed. Its minimal element is a cubic irrationality known as the plastic number. Much is known about the accumulation points of S. The smallest of them is the golden ratio.

CATEGORIES: 1957 births, Living people, American composers, Ethnomusicologists, Gamelan musicians, Asian Cultural Council grantees, People from New York City

Michael Tenzer (born 1957) is a composer, performer, and music educator and scholar. 
Tenzer was born in New York City and studied music at Yale University (BA. 1978) and University of California, Berkeley (Ph.D. 1986). After teaching at Yale from 1986-96, he moved to University of British Columbia where he teaches ethnomusicology, composition, music theory and gamelan performance, co-directs the doctoral program in ethnomusicology.
Tenzer's compositions for chamber, solo and orchestral media have been performed in North America, Europe, and Asia, featuring performers such as Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri (tabla), Alex Klein (oboe) and Evan Ziporyn (clarinet). His publications have been recognized with the Society for Ethnomusicology's Alan P. Merriam Prize (best book of 2000) and the 34th annual ASCAP-Deems Taylor award, and his research has been supported with grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and Fulbright. Among his composition prizes are a Library of Congress/Koussevitzky commission for a chamber work, Sources of Current. After its premiere the New York Times called it "deft, sophisticated and inventive." He received the Charles Ives Center award for his percussion quartet (1981), the DiLorenzo prize for the octet Daya (1985) for string quartet and clarinets, and the Morse Fellowship to complete his Symphony for Strings (1988). Tenzer's music is available on New World, Canteloupe and Bali Stereo labels. 
Since 1977, Tenzer has been deeply involved with the gamelan music of Bali, Indonesia. He carried out several years of research and writing about it on a series of fellowships, among them a Fulbright (1982), a grant from the Asian Cultural Council (1987) the Morse Fellowship (1989), and a National Endowment for the Humanities University Teacher's Fellowship (1994). An experienced performer and teacher of gamelan, Tenzer is the author of two books on the subject: Balinese Music (Periplus: 1991; 2nd ed. 1998) and Gamelan Gong Kebyar: The Art of 20th Century Balinese Music (University of Chicago Press 2000). More recently he published Analytical Studies in World Music (Oxford 2006). He was the first Western composer invited to compose for Balinese ensembles in Bali and has completed a series of works of an increasingly experimental character for the gamelan since 1982, among them Sinar Jegog (1985), Situ Banda ("Bridge of Monkeys"; 1989), Banyuari ("Tributary"; 1992), Talakalam for gamelan with tabla (1999), "Puser Belah" for 2 simultaneous gamelan ("Unstable Center"; 2003), and "Buk Katah" for gamelan with a nonet of brass, winds and piano ("Underleaf"; 2006). These works have been cited by Balinese critics as "an important and unique contribution to our cultural heritage". The last three compositions cited plus others are featured on the 2009 CD Let Others Name You on New World records. In 1979, Tenzer co-founded the Sekar Jaya gamelan ensemble in Berkeley, California, an organization of Americans dedicated to the performance of Balinese arts that is now internationally known. Since 1996 he has directed Gamelan Gita Asmara in Vancouver.

The Mourne Mountains [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔər|n[/tpl] [tpl]respell|MOHRN|'[/tpl], also called the Mournes or Mountains of Mourne, (Irish –  na Beanna Bóirche) are a granite mountain range in County Down in the south-east of Northern Ireland. It includes the highest mountains in Northern Ireland and the province of Ulster. The highest of these is Slieve Donard at [tpl]convert|850|m|ft[/tpl]. The Mournes is an area of outstanding natural beauty and has been proposed as the first national park in Northern Ireland. The area is partly owned by the National Trust and sees a large number of visitors every year. The name Mourne (historically spelt Morne) is derived from the name of a Gaelic clann or sept called the Múghdhorna.Joyce, Patrick.

The Whole Earth Catalog  was an American counterculture catalog published by Stewart Brand between 1968 and 1972, and occasionally thereafter, until 1998.  Although the WECs listed all sorts of products for sale (clothing, books, tools, machines, seeds—things useful for a creative or self-sustainable lifestyle) the Whole Earth Catalogs themselves did not sell any of the products.  Instead, the vendors and their prices were listed alongside the items.  This led to a need for the catalogs to be frequently updated.

The Ulster Scots (Ulster-Scots: Ulstèr-Scotch; [tpl]lang-ga|Ultais[/tpl]) are an ethnic grouphttp://books.google.ie/books?id=-pKgna9SNaEC&pg=PA415&dq=ulster+scots,+cultural+group&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bZ4OUr-RL9SHhQfUiYGAAQ&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=ulster%20scots%2C%20cultural%20group&f=false in Ireland, found mostly in Northern Ireland and the rest of the Ulster region, although also to a lesser extent in the rest of Ireland. Their ancestors were mostly Protestant Lowland Scottish and Northern English people, many being from the "Border Reivers" culture.  These people migrated to Ireland in large numbers with the Plantation of Ulster, a planned process of colonisation which took place under the auspices of James VI of Scotland and I of England on land often confiscated from the Irish nobility, most extensively in the Province of Ulster.
Ulster-Scots were largely descended from colonists from Galloway, Ayrshire, and the Scottish Borders Country, although some descend from people further north in the Scottish Lowlands and the Highlands, as well as areas in England south of Northern England and Wales. Ulster-Scots emigrated in significant numbers to the United States and all corners of the then-worldwide British Empire — Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa along with the British West Indies — and to a lesser extent to Argentina and Chile. Scotch-Irish is a traditional term for Ulster Scots who later emigrated to what is now the United States;  "Scots-Irish" is a more recent form of the American term,The term has usually been Scotch-Irish in America, as evident in Merriam-Webster dictionaries, where the term Scotch-Irish is recorded from 1744. Scots-Irish was recorded in 1972.  See http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scotch-irish, and http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scots-irish and is not to be confused with Irish-Scots, i.e., recent Irish immigrants to Scotland.

Transcendental idealism is a doctrine founded by German philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century. Kant's doctrine maintains that human experience of things is similar to the way they appear to us — implying a fundamentally subject-based component, rather than being an activity that directly (and therefore without any obvious causal link) comprehends the things as they are in and of themselves.

Harry Austryn Wolfson (November 2, 1887 – September 20, 1974) was a scholar, philosopher, and historian at Harvard University,  the first chairman of a Judaic Studies Center in the United States.  He is best known for his seminal work on the Jewish philosopher Philo, but was the author of an astonishing variety and quantity of other works on Crescas, Maimonides, Averroes, Spinoza, the Kalam, the Church Fathers, and the foundations of Western religion.  His greatest contribution may therefore have been in collapsing all the artificial barriers that isolated the study of Christian philosophy from Islamic philosophy from Jewish philosophy [tpl]Harv|Twersky|1975[/tpl].    Being the first Judaica scholar to progress through an entire career at a top-tier university [tpl]Harv|Mendes-Flohr|1998[/tpl], in Wolfson is also represented the fulfillment  of the goals of the 19th-century Wissenschaft des Judentums movement.

The Fairey Battle was a British single-engine light bomber built by the Fairey Aviation Company in the late 1930s for the Royal Air Force. The Battle was powered by the same Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engine that gave contemporary British fighters[tpl]#tag:ref|The Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire were powered by the Rolls-Royce Merlin.|group=N[/tpl] high performance; however, the Battle was weighed down with a three-man crew and a bomb load. Despite being a great improvement on the aircraft that preceded it, by the time it saw action it was slow, limited in range and highly vulnerable to both anti-aircraft fire and fighters with its single defensive .303 machine gun.Ethell 1995, p. 177. 
During the  "Phoney War", the Fairey Battle recorded the first RAF aerial victory of the Second World War but by May 1940 was suffering heavy losses of well over 50% per mission. By the end of 1940 the Battle had been withdrawn from combat service and relegated to training units overseas. For such prewar promise, the Battle was one of the most disappointing of all RAF aircraft.

Möhring was physician to the Prince of Anhalt. In 1752 he published Avium Genera, an early attempt to classify bird species, which divided birds into four classes and shows the beginnings of the modern groupings.
He studied medicine in Danzig and Wittenberg, and following graduation (1733), he settled as a general practitioner in his hometown of Jever. During his long career, he maintained correspondence with Albrecht von Haller, Lorenz Heister, Carl Linnaeus, Hans Sloane and Paul Gottlieb Werlhof.

[[Eastern Front (World War II)]]

The Eastern Front of World War II was a theatre of conflict between the European Axis powers and co-belligerent Finland against the Soviet Union, Poland, NorwayWehrmacht Casualty Reports, the Wehrmacht considered Norway as a sub-theatre of the osten (east) and some other Allies which encompassed Northern, Southern and Central and Eastern Europe from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945. It has been known as the Great Patriotic War ([tpl]lang-ru|Великая Отечественная Война[/tpl]) in the former Soviet Union and in modern Russia, while in Germany it was called the Eastern Front ([tpl]lang-de|die Ostfront[/tpl]),russlandfeldzug.de the Eastern Campaign ([tpl]lang-de|der Ostfeldzug[/tpl]) or the Russian Campaign ([tpl]lang-de|der Rußlandfeldzug[/tpl]).[ref]

torweihe.de[/ref]
The battles on the Eastern Front constituted the largest military confrontation in history. They were characterized by unprecedented ferocity, wholesale destruction, mass deportations, and immense loss of life variously due to combat, starvation, exposure, disease, and massacres. The Eastern Front, as the site of nearly all extermination camps, death marches, ghettos, and the majority of pogroms, was central to the Holocaust. Of the estimated 70 million deaths attributed to World War II, over 30 million, many of them civilian, occurred on the Eastern Front. The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome of World War II, eventually serving as the main reason for Germany's defeat.[tpl]Harvnb|Bellamy|2007|p=xix[/tpl]W. Churchill: "Red Army decided the fate of German militarism". Source: Correspondence of the Council of Ministers of the USSR with the U.S. Presidents and Prime Ministers of Great Britain during the Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945., V. 2. M., 1976, pp. 204Norman Davies: "Since 75%–80% of all German losses were inflicted on the eastern front it follows that the efforts of the Western allies accounted for only 20%–25%". Source: Sunday Times, 05/11/2006. It resulted in the destruction of the Third Reich, the partition of Germany for nearly half a century and the rise of the Soviet Union as a military and industrial superpower.
The two principal belligerent powers were Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies. Though never engaged in military action in the Eastern Front, the United Kingdom and the United States both provided substantial material aid to the Soviet Union, though they failed to meet the specific quotas that had been agreed on. The Soviet–Finnish Continuation War may be considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front. In addition, the joint German–Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish–Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are also considered part of the Eastern Front.

[[Voronwë]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in The Silmarillion, Fictional captains, Fictional characters introduced in 1977, High Elves, Noldor

In Tolkien's The Silmarillion, Voronwë (pronounced [tpl]IPA-art|vɔˈrɔnwɛ|[/tpl]) was a Noldorin Elf from Gondolin. His name is Quenya in origin, meaning 'steadfast one' (the Sindarin form is Bronwë). The name Voronwë also appears as an epessë (honorary title) of various other characters, for example Mardil Voronwë.
Voronwë was relatively young according to the measure of the Elves, having been born in Middle-earth (and specifically in Nevrast) instead of Valinor. His father was Aranwë, a Noldo, but his mother was of the Sindarin Elves of the Falas, and kinswoman of Círdan. Voronwë called himself "of the House of Fingolfin", which in this case likely means a follower of that house, rather than a relationship of blood, although some Tolkien fans have proposed his descent from Irimë, sister of Fingolfin.
Voronwë was among those Gondolindrim who were sent by Turgon to the Bay of Balar after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. Their errand was to seek the help of Círdan in shipbuilding so that they would be able to reach Valinor and deliver the Elves' prayer for aid to the Lords of the West. But he tarried on the way, wandering enchanted in the Willow-meads of Nan-tathren. Thus Voronwë came last of the messengers to Círdan, when six out of seven ships built at Turgon's asking had sailed into the West.
He was the captain of the last, and the greatest, ship that for seven years journeyed across Belegaer, seeking a path into the West through "loathing, and loneliness, and madness; terror of wind and tumult, and silence, and shadows where all hope is lost and all living shapes pass away".[tpl]ME-ref|UT|Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin, p. 36[/tpl] Still, the Doom of the Valar worked against them, and the West was still shut. In despair they turned back, but when already within the sight of Mortal Lands, their ship was caught in a great storm and drowned.
However, Voronwë was spared, alone of all sent by Turgon and Círdan. He was saved by Ulmo and cast ashore at Vinyamar, the land of his birth. There he was greeted by Tuor of the Third House of Men, who passed him Ulmo's bidding to guide Tuor to Gondolin. Reluctantly, Voronwë obeyed, remembering the prophecies of old. For more than a month they journeyed eastward along the southern slopes of Ered Wethrin to the entrance into the Hidden City, in spite of the Doom of the Valar and the Malice of the Enemy, protected by Ulmo's power. On the road they met Tuor's first cousin Túrin Turambar by the ruins of Eithel Ivrin without recognizing him. Voronwë was admitted to Gondolin as a former inhabitant; Tuor was at first held captive, but then released and was able to pass to Turgon Ulmo's warnings.
There is no further mention of Voronwë in the canon works, except a statement where it is implied that he survived the Fall of Gondolin.Unfinished Tales: Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin, p. 33 and note 12. Other accounts suggest that later he sailed into the West with Tuor and Idril.[tpl]ME-ref|WotJ|The Tale of Years, p. 352, 354[/tpl]

[[Western Front (World War II)]]
CATEGORIES: Western European theatre of World War II, Western European Campaign (1944–1945)

The Western Front of the European Theatre of World War II encompassed Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, and Western Germany.German deployments to the Western Front (including North Africa and Italy) reached levels as high as approximately 40% of their ground forces, and 75% of the Luftwaffe. During 1944, there were approximately 69 German divisions in France, in Italy there were around 19. (Approximate data is given because the number of units changed over time as a result of troop transfers and the arrival of new units.) [tpl]cite book |work=Source-Axis History Factbook |title=The Second World War |first=John |last=Keegan [/tpl] According to David Glantz PDF[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl], In January 1945 the Axis fielded over 2.3 million men, including 60 percent of the Wehrmacht's forces and the forces of virtually all of its remaining allies, against the Red Army. In the course of the ensuing winter campaign, the Wehrmacht suffered 510,000 losses in the East against 325,000 in the West. By April 1945, 1,960,000 German troops faced the 6.4 million Red Army troops at the gates of Berlin, in Czechoslovakia, and in numerous isolated pockets to the east, while four million Allied forces in western Germany faced under one million Wehrmacht soldiers. In May 1945 the Soviets accepted the surrender of almost 1.5 million men, while almost  one million more fortunate Germans soldiers surrendered to the British and Americans, including many who fled west to escape the dreaded Red Army. World War II military engagements in Southern Europe and elsewhere are generally considered under separate headings.  The Western Front was marked by two phases of large-scale combat operations. The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. The second phase consisted of large-scale ground combat, which began in June 1944 with the Allied landings in Normandy and continued until the defeat of Germany in May 1945.
Although the majority of German military deaths occurred on the Eastern Front, German losses on the Western Front were almost irreplaceable, because most of Germany's resources were being allocated to the Eastern Front. This meant that, while losses there could be replaced to some extent, very few replacements or reinforcements were being sent to the west to stop the advance of the Western Allies. The Normandy landings  was a tremendous psychological blow to the German military and its leaders, who had feared a repetition of the two-front war of World War I.

The 2001 census found 6,870 inhabitants in 2,758 households. About two miles to the north of the village is the site of the possible deserted settlement of Salterford.
The parish is bounded on the south-east by Woodborough,  to the south-west by Arnold, Papplewick and Ravenshead, to the north by Blidworth, and to the north-east by Oxton and Epperstone.Calverton ecclesiastical parish map
For most of its existence Calverton was one of the forest villages in that part of Sherwood known as Thorney Wood Chase, with an economy in which handicrafts, like the knitting of stockings, will have assumed a more than usual rural importance.J. Thirsk, (ed.), The Agrarian History of England and Wales, Vol.IV, 1500-1640 (Cambridge, 1967), p.97 The parliamentary enclosure of 1780 brought agrarian progress to the village, but it was not until the opening of a colliery by the National Coal Board in 1952, that the village began to assume its present identity, with new housing estates and population growth. In 1957 Colonel Frank Seely School, the main secondary school serving the area, opened. 
The colliery closed in 1999 and while a small industrial estate provided some local employment, Calverton has taken on the character of a large commuter village. 
In May 1974 the village was officially twinned with Longué-Jumelles, in the Loire valley of France .

Its members were signed to major record label EMI Records and afterwards released their self-titled debut album Junoon in 1991. After two years, the band recorded their second album Talaash (1993) with their new bassist Brian O'Connell after Nusrat Hussain left the band. The release of their second album began to create a cult following for the band. In 1996, Junoon released their third album Inquilaab, and it was only then that Junoon developed a nationwide fan following, with blending rock guitars and bluesy vocals with Eastern elements like the use of tablas, raga-inspired melodies, traditional Pakistani folk music, and Eastern-inspired poetry. The following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed Azadi (1997), being the band's first international record deal, and making it Junoon's debut album in neighbouring India. The band went on to record and release Parvaaz in 1999. The band found renewed success and popularity starting with 2001's Andaz and through 2003's Dewaar and their supporting tours.

It was the first time during the war that a significant German force fought on the defensive.Maule, p. 115 The operation did not succeed though, as British forces launched their initial assaults against strong defensive positions created by German General Erwin Rommel. The British lost over half of their tanks on the first day and only achieved victory at one of their three thrusts. They achieved mixed results on the second day, being pushed back on their western flank, but repelled a significant German counter-attack in their centre. On the third day, the British narrowly avoided outright disaster by withdrawing just ahead of a German encircling movement which would have cut them off from retreat.
The failure of this operation led to the replacement of British General Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, by Claude Auchinleck.

[[Transcendental curve]]

CATEGORIES: Curves

In mathematics, a transcendental curve is a curve that is not an algebraic curve.Newman, JA, The Universal Encyclopedia of Mathematics, Pan Reference Books, 1976, ISBN 0-330-24396-9, "Transcendental curves". Here for a curve, C, what matters is the point set (typically in the plane) underlying C, not a given parametrisation. For example, the unit circle is an algebraic curve (pedantically, the real points of such a curve); the usual parametrisation by trigonometric functions may involve those transcendental functions, but certainly the unit circle is defined by a polynomial equation. (The same remark applies to elliptic curves and elliptic functions; and in fact to curves of genus > 1 and automorphic functions.)
The properties of algebraic curves, such as Bézout's theorem, give rise to criteria for showing curves actually are transcendental. For example an algebraic curve C either meets a given line L in a finite number of points, or possibly contains all of L. Thus a curve intersecting any line in an infinite number of points, while not containing it, must be transcendental. This applies not just to sinusoidal curves, therefore; but to large classes of curves showing oscillations.
The term is originally attributed to Leibniz.

[[Vinculum (ligament)]]

CATEGORIES: Upper limb anatomy, Ligaments

In anatomy, a vinculum (pl. vincula) is a band of connective tissue, similar to a ligament, that connect a flexor tendon to a phalanx bone.  They contain tiny vessels which supply blood to the tendon.[ref]
</ref>
In vertebrate anatomy, they are referred to as mesotendons.
For example, in the fingers and toes of humans and related vertebrates, vincula are responsible for the direct vascularization of the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus tendons to the intermediate and distal phalanges in each finger.  These vincula are four folds in the synovial membrane that carry blood vessels to the body and insertion of the tendon.  The tendon receives some additional nutrition directly from the synovial fluid in the sheath, which is important in case of partial loss of direct vascularization from the vincula.[ref]
</ref>
In the chick, vincula are much larger and more complex than in humans.  Though they contain blood vessels, these only make up a very limited portion of the total mass of the vincula, most of whom consists of collagen and elastic fibres.
A vinculum is also found in insects' male genitalia. Unlike the vertebrate structures, it is part of the exoskeleton, being formed by the ventral part of the ninth abdominal segment. It retains the aedeagus and the clasper attaches to it.

CATEGORIES: Plantaginaceae

Cymbalaria is a genus of about 10 species of herbaceous perennial plants previously treated in the family Scrophulariaceae, but recently shown by genetic research to be in the much enlarged family Plantaginaceae. 
The genus is native to southern Europe.  It is closely related to the genera Linaria and Antirrhinum, differing in having creeping growth and flowers borne singly rather than in dense erect spikes. The common name toadflax is shared with Linaria and other related genera. The scientific name means "resembling a cymbal" for the somewhat rounded leaves.
By far the best known species is Cymbalaria muralis (also called Ivy-leaved toadflax, and Kenilworth Ivy), native to southwest Europe. It has widely naturalised elsewhere and is commonly sold as a garden plant. C. muralis characteristically grows in sheltered crevices in walls and pathways, or in rocks and scree, making a trailing or scrambling plant up to 1 m long.

Operation Crusader was a military operation by the British Eighth Army between 18 November–30 December 1941 during the Second World War. The operation successfully relieved the 1941 Siege of Tobruk.
The Eighth Army's initial plan to destroy the Axis armoured force before advancing its infantry came apart when, after a number of inconclusive engagements, the British 7th Armoured Division were heavily defeated by the Afrika Korps at Sidi Rezegh. Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel's subsequent advance of his armoured divisions to the Axis fortress positions on the Egyptian border failed to find the main body of the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk, so Rommel had to withdraw his armoured units to support the fighting at Tobruk. Despite achieving some tactical successes at Tobruk, the need to preserve his remaining forces prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk, and then all the way back to El Agheila. It was the first victory over the German ground forces by British-led forces in the Second World War.Taylor 1974, p. 86

[[Wall crab spider]]
CATEGORIES: Selenopidae

The wall crab spiders (family Selenopidae) are members of a group of families collectively called crab spiders because of their laterigrade (sideways-moving) legs. This family consists of about 175 species in four genera, of which Selenops is the best known. The family is primarily tropical with the genus Anyphops confined to Sub-Saharan Africa and the genus Hovops confined to Madagascar. The spiders are very flat and are commonly found on walls or under rocks. They are quite agile and very difficult to capture. In addition their coloring makes them often quite difficult to see. Like almost all Entelegynae, they have eight eyes. At least one species of Garcorops, G. jadis, is known only from subfossil copal.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bosselaers |first1=J. |year=2004|title=A new Garcorops species from Madagascar copal (Araneae: Selenopidae) |journal=Zootaxa |volume=445 |pages=1–7 |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2004f/zt00445.pdf[/tpl]

It got its name when this branch of the river became increasingly moribund. A harbor canal was constructed with the Westerplatte on one of its banks. It was constructed to flow through Danzig (Gdańsk) into the Danziger Bucht, now Gdańsk Bay. Its river mouth and environs double as a harbor channel for the Inner Port of the port of Gdańsk.

[[Deba bōchō]]
CATEGORIES: Japanese kitchen knives

Deba bōchō (出刃包丁, literally: pointed carving knife) are Japanese style kitchen carvers primarily used to cut fish, though also used when cutting meat. They come in different sizes, sometimes up to 30 cm (12 inches) in length. The deba bōchō first appeared during the Edo period in Sakai. It is designed to behead and fillet fish. Its thickness, and often a more obtuse angle on the back of the heel allow it to cut off the heads of fish without damage. The rest of the blade is then used to ride against the fish bones, separating the fillet. Traditionally, these are made of carbon steel, which needs regular maintenance and oiling to prevent rust. However, many modern knives are also available as stainless steel, which may be dishwasher safe. The carbon steel blades, however, can be sharpened into a sharper cutting edge.
The deba is not intended for chopping large diameter bones.Japanese Knives, Cooks Knives.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

[[Donabe]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese cooking tools

Donabe (Japanese: 土鍋, literally "earthenware pot") are pots made out of a special clay [tpl]Fact|date=February 2007[/tpl] for use over an open flame in the Japanese kitchen. Often, the food is cooked right at the table on a gas burner for various nabemono dishes such as shabu-shabu.
The donabe is usually glazed on the inside and porous on the outside. The material is similar to earthenware or stoneware (although normally, earthen- or stoneware pots should usually not be used over an open flame). Donabe however, can be used over an open flame as well as in an oven if three precautions are taken. First, the outside of the donabe should be dry before use, as moisture within the clay will expand in the heat and may chip or crack the pot. Secondly, the pot should be heated gradually to reduce the possibility of cracks due to heat stress. Third, the pot should never be left over the flame while empty.
If properly treated, these pots should last for decades and a few special ones have survived for centuries.  When a new donabe is obtained, one should let the donabe boil water for hours and dry before using it for cooking.  Other sources suggest that the user should simply fill the donabe with water and let it sit overnight.  This process should be repeated if the donabe has been unused for a long time.
In old ryoutei of Kyoto, decades-old donabe would be stored and only used for special guests.  Young donabe would be used for preparing lunch menus and food for cooks, to age them for this purpose.

[[Suribachi]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese cooking tools, Food grinding tools

Suribachi (すり鉢　or 擂鉢, literally: grinding-bowl) and surikogi (すりこぎ or 擂粉木, literally: grind-powder-wood) are a Japanese mortar and pestle. These mortars are used in Japanese cooking to crush different ingredients such as sesame seeds.
The suribachi is a pottery bowl, glazed on the outside and with a rough pattern called kushi-no-me on the unglazed inside. This surface is somewhat similar to the surface of the oroshigane (grater). The surikogi pestle is made from wood to avoid excessive wear on the suribachi. Traditionally, the wood from the sanshō tree (Japanese prickly ash) was used, which adds a slight flavor to the food, although nowadays other woods are more common. The bowls have a diameter from 10 cm to 30 cm. To use the suribachi the bowl is set on a non-slip surface, such as a rubber mat or a damp towel, and the surikogi is used to grind the material. Recently, plastic versions of the suribachi have also become popular, but they have a much shorter lifespan.
The suribachi and surikogi arrived in Japan from China around 1000 AD. The mortar was first used for medicine, and only later for food products.
A larger sized Japanese mortar used to pound rice is an usu with a pestle called kine.
The highest mountain on Iwo Jima, Mount Suribachi was named after this kitchen device.

[[Oroshigane]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese cooking tools

[tpl]nihongo3|"grating metal"|おろし金[tpl]lang|en| or [/tpl]下ろし金|Oroshigane[/tpl], also known as [tpl]nihongo3||下ろし器|oroshiki[/tpl] are graters used in Japanese cooking.
These oroshigane differ significantly from Western-style graters, as they produce a much finer grating. Traditionally, these graters were tin-coated copper plates with many small spikes gouged out of the metal, but no actual perforations through the metal. These graters are still considered the best and are used by professional chefs. For preparing wasabi and yamaimo, graters with the surface made from shark skin were exclusively used. These have an even finer grating surface than a metal one; much closer to a sanding paper. However, nowadays non-professional cooks usually use much less expensive graters made from other metals, plastic, or ceramics. A modern variation of these graters also has perforations and may come with a matching box so that the grated material drops through the grater into the box. 
There are two versions of the grater in common use with different coarseness. The coarse grater is used to grate daikon and the like, whereas the fine graters are used for grating wasabi or ginger. The fine graters are also sometimes sold as a wooden board covered with shark skin, which has many tiny teeth (dermal denticles) and give it a feel similar to sandpaper.

[[Zaru]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese cooking tools

A [tpl]nihongo|zaru|笊, ざる[/tpl] is a draining basket made from bamboo used in the preparation and presentation of Japanese cuisine. It can be used in a similar fashion to a sieve or colander, both of which are common in western cooking. Additionally, well-designed zaru are used to present food directly, as for example zarusoba. Plastic and metal versions of the zaru have also come into use, but are rarely used to present food.
Similar to the makisu, zaru are dried and stored after use to extend the lifespan of the tool and prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi on the mat. However, drying in harsh sunlight can cause the bamboo of the zaru to crack.
Reflecting the zaru's capacity to soak up liquid, this term is also used as slang for a person who can drink a lot of alcohol without showing signs of inebriation.

[[Agemono nabe]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese cooking tools

Agemono nabe (Japanese: 揚げ物鍋, Literally: pot for fried things) are very thick pots used for deep frying in the Japanese kitchen. They are made usually of either cast iron or heavy brass. The thickness ensures an even temperature of the oil inside of the pot. Thin pots cannot maintain an even temperature of the oil, possibly allowing food to slightly under- or overcook.
The agemono nabe is usually used in combination with metal-ended Japanese kitchen chopsticks, a net ladle or scoop ami shakushi,  and a tool to drain the oil after frying abura kiri.

A makisu is usually 25 cm x 25 cm, although this may vary. There are two variations, one with thick bamboo strips and the other with thin. Experts consider the thick mat more versatile, while the thin mat is designed specifically for makizushi. These mats come in various sizes.  
After use, a makisu should be thoroughly air dried to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi. Some cooks cover the makisu with plastic film before use to reduce the cleaning effort. This is especially necessary for producing uramaki (裏巻), a kind of maki sushi (巻き寿司) with the rice on the outside of the roll. Makisu are inexpensive so people can simply dispose of them after use.

Nakiri bōchō (菜切り包丁, translation: knife for cutting greens) and usuba bōchō (薄刃包丁, thin knife) are Japanese-style vegetable knives. They differ from the deba bōchō in their shape, as they have a straight blade edge suitable for cutting all the way to the cutting board without the need for a horizontal pull or push.http://www.knife-making-supplies.net/japanese-kitchen-knives.html Japanese Kitchen Knives These knives are also much thinner. While the deba bōchō is a heavy blade for easy cutting through thin bones, the blade is not suitable for chopping vegetables, as the thicker blade can break the vegetable slice. The nakiri bōchō and the usuba bōchō have a much thinner blade. This does not help with cutting small bones in fish or meat, but is useful for cutting vegetables.
Nakiri bōchō are knives for home use, and usually have a black blade. The shape of the nakiri bōchō differs according to the region of origin, with knives in the Tokyo area being rectangular in shape, whereas the knives in the Osaka area are called kamagata nakiri and have a rounded corner on the far blunt side. There are also kamagata usuba. The cutting edge is angled from both sides, called ryōba in Japanese. This makes it easier to cut straight slices.
Usuba bōchō are vegetable knives used by professionals. They differ from the Nakiri bōchō in the shape of the cutting edge. While the nakiri bōchō is sharpened from both sides, the usuba bōchō is sharpened only from one side, a style known as kataba in Japanese. The highest quality kataba blades have a slight depression on the flat side. This kataba style edge gives better cuts and allows for the cutting of thinner slices than the ryōba used for nakiri bōchō, but requires more skill to use. The sharpened side is usually the right side for a right hand use of the knife, but knives sharpened on the left side are available for left hand use. The usuba bōchō is heavier than a nakiri bōchō, although still much lighter than a deba bōchō.http://zen-cooking.com/index.php?main_page=page_2 Kind and History of Hocho

[[Otoshi buta]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese cooking tools

Otoshi buta (落し蓋, literally: drop-lid) are Japanese-style drop-lids for use in Japanese cooking. These round lids float on top of the liquid in a pot while simmering foods. They ensure that the heat is evenly distributed and reduce the tendency of liquid to boil with large bubbles. This reduces the mechanical stress on the food and keeps fragile ingredients in their original shape.
Otoshi buta are almost always made from wood, so they have to be soaked in water for a few minutes before use to avoid absorbing the flavor of the dish and disturbing the flavor of the next dish cooked using the otoshi buta. After use, the otoshi buta is washed and dried completely before storing.
Though it depends on the recipe and food being cooked, otoshi buta may be substituted with a sheet of tough cooking paper or aluminum foil.

[[Yanagi ba]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese kitchen knives

Yanagi-ba-bōchō (柳刃包丁, lit. willow blade knife), Yanagi-ba or shortly Yanagi is a long and very thin knife used in the Japanese kitchen, belonging to the group of Sashimi hōchō (Japanese: 刺身包丁, Sashimi fish hōchō knife) to prepare sashimi, sushi, sliced raw fish and seafood.
In preparing sashimi and sushi, there are very important conditions that the sliced cross section be smooth, shiny and sharp in a microscopic view. Those conditions cannot be met by other usual knives. Yanabi-ba-bocho is especially designed to satisfy the conditions.  Important design points for it are as follows:
The first two characteristics are particularly for yanagi-ba-bocho, and its name 'yanagi' is from long and pliant characteristics of a willow branch.  The other characteristics are shared by all knives in Japanese cuisine.
The important principle in using a yanagi-ba to prepare sashimi is not cutting down but pulling with its long blade in a single motion.

[[Usuba bōchō]]
CATEGORIES: Japanese kitchen knives

Usuba knives (薄刃包丁) are the traditional vegetable knife for the professional Japanese chef. Like other Japanese professional knives, usuba are chisel ground, and have a bevel on the front side, and have a hollow ground urasuki on the back side. Usuba characteristically have a flat edge, with little or no curve, and are tall, to allow knuckle clearance when chopping on a cutting board. Usuba literally means "thin blade" indicating its relative thinness compared to other knives, required for cutting through firm vegetables without cracking them. The Kanto variation have a square blunt tip, making it appear like a small meat cleaver. The Kansai, kamagata style variation has a spine that drops down to the edge at the tip, allowing the usuba to do fine delicate work. However, this tip is also delicate and can be broken easily. The usuba is particularly popular with Kyoto chefs, who use the Kamagata usuba for most of their work.  Since Kyoto is landlocked, they rely more heavily on vegetables than Tokyo, making the usuba the quintessential knife of professional chefs there. In Kyoto cuisine, the versatile tip allows for intricate cuts and preparations, however due to its height and straight edge usuba in general are used for chopping vegetables, and specialized cuts such as katsuramuki, shaving a vegetable cylinder into a thin sheet.Photo of an usuba knife
The nakiri bōchō are similarly made but sharpened from both sides. They are preferred for home use.

European route E 67 is an E-road running from Prague in the Czech Republic to Helsinki in Finland by way of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and  Estonia. It goes via Prague, Wrocław, Warsaw, Kaunas, Panevėžys, Riga, Tallinn and Helsinki.
It is known as the Via Baltica between Warsaw and Tallinn, a distance of [tpl]convert|970|km[/tpl]. It is a significant road connection between the Baltic states. The final stretch between Tallinn and Helsinki is by ferry (with about 10 car ferry departures each direction per dayViking Line Tallink Eckerö Line).
The route is mostly ordinary road, but there are plans to convert it into a motorway or expressway, in Poland called S8 and S61. The Via Baltica attracted great controversy in 2007, as its planned new express road was to take it through several areas in Poland of great natural value.  Most controversial was the Augustów bypass, which would take the route through the wetlands of the Rospuda Valley, the last area of its kind remaining in Europe,[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] and an area protected by EU law as part of the European Natura 2000 Network.

[[ActionScript]]

CATEGORIES: ActionScript, Adobe Flash, Scripting languages, JavaScript programming language family, Class-based programming languages

ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (now owned by Adobe Systems). It is a dialect of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), and is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash Player platform, used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files. ActionScript 3 is also used with the Adobe Integrated Runtime system for the development of desktop and mobile applications. The language itself is open-source in that its specification is offered free of chargehttp://livedocs.adobe.com/specs/actionscript/3/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm and both an open source compiler (as part of Apache Flex) and open source virtual machine (Mozilla Tamarin) are available.
ActionScript was initially designed for controlling simple 2D vector animations made in Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash). Initially focused on animation, early versions of Flash content offered few interactivity features and thus had very limited scripting capability. Later versions added functionality allowing for the creation of Web-based games and rich Internet applications with streaming media (such as video and audio). Today, ActionScript is suitable for use in some database applications, and in basic robotics, as with the Make Controller Kit. 
Flash MX 2004 introduced ActionScript 2.0, a scripting language more suited to the development of Flash applications. It is often possible to save time by scripting something rather than animating it, which usually also enables a higher level of flexibility when editing.
Since the arrival of the Flash Player 9 alpha (in 2006) a newer version of ActionScript has been released, ActionScript 3.0. This version of the language is intended to be compiled and run on a version of the ActionScript Virtual Machine that has been itself completely re-written from the ground up (dubbed AVM2).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/six_reasons_as3.html |last1=Brimelow |first1=Lee |title=Six reasons to use ActionScript 3.0 |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=August 18, 2008|accessdate=June 18, 2010[/tpl] Because of this, code written in ActionScript 3.0 is generally targeted for Flash Player 9 and higher and will not work in previous versions. At the same time, ActionScript 3.0 executes up to 10 times faster than legacy ActionScript code due to the Just-In-Time compiler enhancements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/actionscript3_overview.html |last1=Grossman |first1=Gary |last2=Huang |first2=Emmy |title=ActionScript 3.0 overview |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=June 27, 2006|accessdate=June 18, 2010[/tpl] 
Flash libraries can be used with the XML capabilities of the browser to render rich content in the browser. This technology is known as Asynchronous Flash and XML, much like AJAX. Adobe offers its Flex product line to meet the demand for Rich Internet Applications built on the Flash runtime, with behaviors and programming done in ActionScript. ActionScript 3.0 forms the foundation of the Flex 2 API.

[[Ælfwine of England]]
CATEGORIES: Middle-earth Men, Fictional British people

Ælfwine is a fictional character found in  various early versions of  J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. Tolkien envisaged Ælfwine as an Anglo-Saxon who visited and befriended the elves and acted as the source of later  mythology. Thus, Ælfwine is  given as the author of the various translations in Old English that appear in The History of Middle-earth Series.  
The Old English name Ælfwine  means "Elf-friend". It is a well attested historical Germanic name, alongside its Old High German and Lombard equivalents, Alwin and Alboin, respectively. 
The unfinished The Lost Road was intended as a tale of "time travel" where descendants of Ælfwine experience memories or visions of their ancestors, connecting the present time with the mythological back to the fall of Atlantis (Númenor).
The later Quenya or "Elven-Latin" name  Elendil translates the name Ælfwine.

Vermont Yankee is an electricity generating nuclear power plant, located in the town of Vernon, Vermont, in the northeastern United States. It generates 620 megawatts (MWe) of electricity at full power. The plant was designed by General Electric, and is a boiling water reactor (BWR).  Entergy, the present owner, has scheduled the plant to cease operations in late 2014. The plant began commercial operations in 1972 under different ownership. In 2008, the plant provided 71.8% of all electricity generated within Vermont, which amounted to 35% of the entire electricity consumed in the state. The plant is on the Connecticut River, upstream of the Vernon, Vermont Hydroelectric Dam. The Connecticut River reservoir pool created by the Vernon dam is drawn upon by Vermont Yankee for its cooling water.
The plant's initial 30-year operating license was scheduled to expire in March 2012; the license was extended for 20 years by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in March 2011.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]   Vermont Yankee's continued operations was complicated by the Vermont state legislature's enactment of a law providing the state legislature authority to determine the continued operation of the plant, in addition to the federal government. Entergy requested a new state certificate of public good (CPG), but the Vermont legislature voted in February 2010 against allowing renewed permission to operate.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] In January 2012, Entergy won a court case, invalidating the state's veto power on continued operations. On August 28, 2013, Entergy announced that economic factors, notably the lower cost of electricity provided by competing natural gas-fired power plants, had led Entergy to cease operations and schedule the decommissioning of the plant in the fourth quarter of 2014.
There have been many anti-nuclear protests about Vermont Yankee since the 1970s, including large protests following the Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011 and on the date of the original operating license expiry in March 2012.

[[Mithral Hall]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional populated places, Forgotten Realms cities

In the fictional world of Forgotten Realms, Mithral Hall (sometimes referred to as Mithril Hall) is the fabled dwarven home of Bruenor Battlehammer, an old dwarven city where tunnels were often lined with natural veins of mithral as thick as an arm.
Bruenor was but a non-bearded dwarven youth when gray dwarves, with the aid of a shadow dragon named Shimmergloom, attacked Mithral Hall and drove out his clan. Its surviving members were scattered, with a main remnant, containing Bruenor, escaping to Icewind Dale. Bruenor rose to leadership of the hundred or so dwarves that remained, and eked out a profitable partnership with the human settlement Ten-Towns, though the dwarf treasured his few memories of his home and vowed to return there. Bruenor tricked Drizzt into vowing to help him find it. After finding it, Bruenor and his companions took back Mithral Hall with the aid of Citadel Adbar, Longsaddle, and Nesmé. After it was reclaimed, the Clan Battlehammer dwarves moved from Icewind Dale back to their ancestral home of Mithral Hall. Dwarves from other strongholds immigrated to Mithral Hall, as well. Bruenor then became the eighth king and later the tenth king after his ancestor, the first king Gandalug, was recrowned and later died.
After that, Matron Baenre of Menzoberranzan's first house used the city's hatred for Drizzt Do'Urden to mount a war effort against Mithral Hall. Publicly vowing to send Drizzt to the Spider Queen, her main motivation was a rout of the dwarven fortress. The battle for Mithral Hall was incredibly pitched, with the day's light ultimately crippling the light-sensitive drow soldiers. Drizzt and his companions fought and killed Matron Baenre and her party, forcing the remaining drow attackers to retreat.
Several years later, an orc king named Obould massed a huge army of orcs, goblins, trolls, and frost giants together, intending to take Mithral Hall for himself. Bruenor and his friends were forced to hold off a massive army, but managed to seal themselves into the fortress where they could wait out the orcs.

James Harrison Wilson (September 2, 1837 – February 23, 1925) was a United States Army topographic engineer and a Union Army Major General in the American Civil War. In the Maryland campaign, he served as an aide to McClellan, before joining Grant’s army in the West, where he was promoted brigadier. 
In 1864, he transferred from engineering to the cavalry, where he displayed notable leadership in many engagements of the Overland campaign, though his attempt to destroy Lee’s supply-line failed, when he was routed by a much-smaller and irregular Confederate force.
At the Battle of Franklin, he became one of the few commanders ever to defeat the legendary cavalry leader Bedford Forrest, helping to secure decisive Union victory in that campaign. Later, in Georgia, he had the honour of capturing the Confederate President Jefferson Davis.
Wilson was the fourth-last surviving Union general.

In organic chemistry, a nucleophilic addition reaction is an addition reaction where a chemical compound with an electron deficient or electrophilic double or triple bond, a π bond, reacts with electron rich reactant, termed a nucleophile, with disappearance of the double bond and creation of two new single, or σ, bonds. The reactions are involved in the biological synthesis of compounds in the metabolism of every living organism, and are used by chemists in academia and industries such as pharma to prepare most new complex organic chemicals, and so are spoken of as being central to organic chemistry. Addition reactions require the presence of groups with multiple-bondes in the electrophile: carbon–heteroatom multiple bonds as in carbonyls, imines, and nitriles, or carbon–carbon double or triple bonds.

[[Organolithium reagent]]
CATEGORIES: Organolithium compounds

Organolithium reagents are organometallic compounds that contain carbon – lithium bonds. They are important reagents in organic synthesis, and are frequently used to transfer the organic group or the lithium atom to the substrates in synthetic steps, through nucleophilic addition or simple deprotonation.[ref]

</ref> Organolithium reagents are used in industry as an initiator for [[anionic polymerization]], which leads to the production of various [[elastomers]]. They have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry.<ref name=orglipharm>

[/ref] 
Due to the large difference in electronegativity between the carbon atom and the lithium atom, the C-Li bond is highly ionic. This extremely polar nature of the C-Li bond makes organolithium reagents good nucleophiles and strong bases. For laboratory organic synthesis, many organolithium reagents are commercially available in solution form. These reagents are highly reactive, sometimes pyrophoric. thumb|right|Glass bottles containing butyllithium

[[Catholic Youth Organization]]
CATEGORIES: Catholic lay societies, Catholic youth organizations, Religious organizations established in 1930

A Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) is an organization for young Catholics. Usually each group uses the church for meeting and gathering, although some have their own premises.  It was initiated by Bishop Bernard J. Sheil of Chicago in the year 1930.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] 
The organization's main purposes are guiding the young Catholics to live a Christian life from a young age, developing trust between peers, and living a happy life in a positive manner.
Activities vary in accordance with local culture but often includes prayer, singing, charity, sales, sports and visiting the sick. In the United States, CYO is mainly known for its organized sports programs, notably boxing, basketball, baseball, track and field, and volleyball, as well as marching bands.  Its athletic contests are often so competitive that CYO has been jokingly described as "Crush Your Opponents."[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
There are also active units of this organization in the Philippines. Most units are choirs of their parishes, and they also organize various activities under sports, spiritual, social, cultural, formation, ways and means, and membership committees. All of these projects have helped in nurturing the faith of the Filipino Christian youth, their holistic growth, leadership capabilities, cultural and artistic talents, love for the family, and for the community. CYO in the Philippines was founded by Fr. George J. Willman in the year 1938, with Loreto Parish in Sampaloc, Manila as the pilot unit. Its National Chaplain, Emeritus is Msgr. Francisco Tantoco, and Fr. Jerome Cruz as National Chaplain. CYO's Founder's Day is celebrated every 29 June, which is also Fr. George J. Willman's birthday. 
The largest Catholic youth organization in the world is CFC-Youth for Christ, which is based in the Philippines and established in 160 countries worldwide together with its community, Couples for Christ.  Another Youth movement that has risen from the continent of Asia is Jesus Youth, spread across 25 countries in the world. There is a gathering every two (or three) years for the young Catholics of the world called World Youth Day. Rexband, the music ministry of Jesus Youth is the only music band from Asia to perform during World Youth Day 2002, held in Canada. In 2008, it was  held in Sydney from 15 to 20 July.

[[Late-night news]]
CATEGORIES: Local news programming in the United States

Late-night news is television news programming broadcast late at night, often focussing on local news stories.
In the United States, late-night local news is traditionally broadcast at 11:00 pm local time on stations affiliated with the Big Three television networks (CBS, NBC, and ABC) as well as those owned and operated by CTV and Global in Canada that are in the Eastern Time Zone or the Pacific Time Zone. In contrast, stations in the Central and Alaska time zones air their local news at 10:00 pm local time, with stations in other, more exotic time zones following their own schedules. The late local news is typically scheduled in-between a network's prime time programming and its late night offerings. Stations that are affiliated with Fox, The CW, MyNetworkTV, or that are independent stations tend to have newscasts at 10:00 pm (Eastern/Pacific), 9:00 pm (Central/Mountain; in these time zones, the 9:00 news is often marketed as a "prime time" newscast). 
The late local news is generally between 35 minutes (for Big Three affiliates) to 60 minutes (in Canada and on some larger non-Big Three stations in the U.S.) in length; smaller stations not affiliated with the Big Three may have newscasts fit to a 30-minute time slot. Prior to the 1960s, the typical late-night newscast lasted a mere 15 minutes; this short-form late local news is still common on local owned-and-operated stations of the CBC, which airs The National as its hourlong late-night news across Canada. Many stories on the 11 pm newscasts are follow-ups of ones airing earlier in the day, including scores from the evening's sporting events.
The stock phrase "film at 11" comes from promos run during prime time for the upcoming newscast, promising shots from a breaking story during the 11 pm newscast. However, it has gone out of the television lexicon due to technological advances in remote broadcasting have made getting film back to the station a thing of the past.
Late local news is commonplace in Canada in part due to the ease in which it can be produced to meet that country's domestic content quotas.

Fiber crops are field crops grown for their fibers, which are traditionally used to make paper,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.paperonweb.com/articles.htm |title=Multiple references to non-wood fibers for paper |accessdate=2007-10-19 |last= Goyal  |first=Hari|coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=PaperOnWeb, PULP & PAPER RESOURCES & INFORMATION SITE[/tpl] cloth, or rope. The fibers may be chemically modified, like in viscose (used to make rayon and cellophane). In recent years materials scientists have begun exploring further use of these fibers in composite materials.
Fiber crops are generally harvestable after a single growing season, as distinct from trees, which are typically grown for many years before being harvested for wood pulp fiber. In specific circumstances, fiber crops can be superior to wood pulp fiber in terms of technical performance, environmental impact or cost.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agripulp.com/index.html|title=Agripulp: pulping agricultural crops|accessdate=2007-10-03[/tpl] 
There are a number of issues regarding the use of fiber crops to make pulp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bc.com/environment/positionNonwood.jsp|title=Nonwood Alternatives to Wood Fiber in Paper|accessdate=2007-10-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070708092411/http://www.bc.com/environment/positionNonwood.jsp  |archivedate = 2007-07-08[/tpl] One of these is seasonal availability.  While trees can be harvested continuously, many field crops are harvested once during the year and must be stored such that the crop doesn't rot over a period of many months. Considering that many pulp mills require several thousand tonnes of fiber source per day, storage of the fiber source can be a major issue.
Botanically, the fibers harvested from many of these plants are bast fibers; the fibers come from the phloem tissue of the plant. The other fiber crop fibers are seed padding, leaf fiber, or other parts of the plant.

[[Spaniel]]

CATEGORIES: Dog types, Hunting dogs, Spaniels, Sporting dogs

A spaniel is a type of gun dog. It is assumed spaniels originated from Spain as the word spaniel may be derived from Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) or possibly from the French phrase "Chiens de l’Espagnol" (Dogs of the Spaniard). Spaniels were especially bred to flush game out of dense brush. By the late 17th century spaniels had become specialized into water and land breeds. The extinct English Water Spaniel was used to retrieve water fowl shot down with arrows. Land spaniels were setting spaniels—those that crept forward and pointed their game, allowing hunters to ensnare them with nets, and springing spaniels—those that sprang pheasants and partridges for hunting with falcons, and rabbits for hunting with greyhounds. During the 17th century, the role of the spaniel dramatically changed as Englishmen began hunting with flintlocks for wing shooting. Charles Goodall and Julia Gasow (1984)Goodall and Gasow, The New Complete English Springer Spaniel, 1984. write the spaniels were "transformed from untrained, wild beaters, to smooth, polished gun dogs."

Many of them have massive, fleshy rootstocks and the largest known fronds of any fern. The Marattiaceae is one of two groups of ferns traditionally known as eusporangiate fern,C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Fern. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment. Washington, DC meaning that the sporangium is formed from a group of cells vs the leptosporangium in which there is a single initial cell. There have long been four traditional extant genera (Angiopteris, Christensenia, Danaea and Marattia), but recent genetic/cladistic analysis [tpl]cite journal | last=Murdock | first=Andrew G.| year=2008 | title= A taxonomic revision of the eusporangiate fern family Marattiaceae, with description of a new genus Ptisana | journal=Taxon | volume= 57 | issue=3 | pages= 737–755 [/tpl] has determined the genus Marattia to be paraphyletic, and the genus has been split into three genera, the two new ones being Eupodium and Ptisana. This fern group has a long fossil history with many extinct taxa (Psaronius, Asterotheca, Scolecopteris, Eoangiopteris, Qasimia, Marantoidea, Danaeites, Marattiopsis, etc.).
In this group, such fronds are found in the genus Angiopteris, native to Australasia, Madagascar and Oceania. These fronds may be up to 9 meters long in the species Angiopteris teysmanniana of Java. In Jamaica the species Angiopteris evecta is widely naturalized and is registered as an invasive species. The plant was introduced by Captain Bligh from Tahiti as a staple food for slaves and cultivated in the Castleton Botanical Garden in 1860. From there it was able to distribute itself throughout the eastern half of the island.
The East-Asian genus Christensenia is named in honor of the Danish pteridologist Carl Christensen is an uncommon fern with distinctive fronds resembling a horse chestnut leaf, hence the species Christensenia aesculifolia, meaning horse-chestnut-leaved Christensenia.
The most widespread genus in Marattiaceae is the pantropical Marattia, usually occurring at higher elevations. These are also large ferns with globular rhizomes, but fronds can be up to 4 times pinnate. The sporangia are fused into bivalvate structures called a synangium. 
The fourth genus Danaea is endemic to the Neotropics. They have bipinnate leaves with opposite pinnae, which are dimorphic, the fertile leaves much contracted, and covered below with sunken synangia.
The genus Eupodium is also neotropical, with two species. It has fronds that are 2-5 times pinnate, stalked synangia, and awns on the adaxial side of distal blade segments. Blade division decreases towards the apex of the frond. Plants of Eupodium usually only have one frond per plant per year (sometimes two).
Ptisana is a paleotropical genus. These plants are 2-4 times pinnate. Terminal segments usually have a prominent suture where they attach. The sporangia lack the labiate apertures of Marattia and Eupodium, and synangia are deeply cut.  The King Fern, Ptisana salicina, from New Zealand and the South Pacific and known in Māori as para now has been placed in this genus. Sometimes called the Potato Fern, this is a large fern with an edible fleshy rhizome that is used as a food source by some indigenous peoples.
Several other genera have been named in the Marattiaceae, namely: Archangiopteris, Macroglossum, Protangiopteris, and Protomarattia. These are all synonyms of Angiopteris.
According to recent molecular studies it appears that these eusporangiate ferns may be a sister group to the horsetails (Equisetaceae). Both groups are certainly of ancient lineage.

Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta (often shortened to Shikasta) is a 1979 science fiction novel by British Nobel Prize in Literature-winner Doris Lessing, and is the first book in her five-book Canopus in Argos series. It was first published in the United States in October 1979 by Alfred A. Knopf, and in the United Kingdom in November 1979 by Jonathan Cape. Shikasta is also the name of the fictional planet featured in the novel.
Subtitled "Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days", Shikasta is the history of the planet Shikasta (Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, Canopus, Sirius, and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The book is presented in the form of a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to Shikasta who document the planet's prehistory, its degeneration leading to the "Century of Destruction" (the 20th century), and the Apocalypse (World War III).
Shikasta draws on the Old Testament and is influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism, an Islamic belief system which Lessing had taken an interest in the mid-1960s. The book represented a major shift of focus in Lessing's writing, from realism to science fiction, and this disappointed many of her readers. It received mixed reviews from critics. Some were impressed by the scope and vision of the book, with one reviewer calling it "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers". Others were critical of the novel's bleakness, that humanity has no free will and that their fate lies in the hands of galactic empires.
The story of Shikasta is retold in the third book of the Canopus series, The Sirian Experiments (1980), this time from the point of view of Sirius. Shikasta reappears in the fourth book in the series, The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (1982), and the Zones, briefly mentioned in Shikasta, are the subject of the second book in the series, The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five (1980).

[[Regioselectivity]]
CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry

In chemistry, regioselectivity is the preference of one direction of chemical bond making or breaking over all other possible directions.[tpl]JerryMarch[/tpl]http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/351/Carey5th/Ch06/ch6-0-1.html Regioselectivity & Stereoselectivity It can often apply to which of many possible positions a reagent will affect, such as which proton a strong base will abstract from an organic molecule, or where on a substituted benzene ring a further substituent will add.
A specific example is a halohydrin formation reaction with 2-propenylbenzene:Regioselectivity in Organic Synthesis: Preparation of the Bromohydrin of alpha-Methylstyrene Brad Andersh, Kathryn N. Kilby, Meghan E. Turnis, and Drew L. Murphy 102 Journal of Chemical Education • Vol. 85 No. 1 January 2008
Because of the preference for the formation of one product over another, the reaction is selective.  This reaction is regioselective because it selectively generates one constitutional isomer rather than the other.
Certain examples of regioselectivity have been formulated as rules for certain classes of compounds under certain conditions, many of which are named. Among the first introduced to chemistry students are Markovnikov's rule for the addition of protic acids to alkenes, and the Fürst-Plattner rule for the addition of nucleophiles to derivatives of cyclohexene, especially epoxide derivatives.W. Markownikoff (1870). "Ueber die Abhängigkeit der verschiedenen Vertretbarkeit des Radicalwasserstoffs in den isomeren Buttersäuren". Annalen der Pharmacie 153 (1): 228–259.Fürst, A.; Plattner, P. A. Helv. Chim. Acta 1949, 32, 275
Regioselectivity in ring-closure reactions is subject to Baldwin's rules.
If there are two or more orientations that can be generated during a reaction, one
of them is dominant (e.g., Markovnikov/anti-Markovnikov addition across a double 
bond)
Regioselectivity can also be applied to specific reactions such as addition to pi ligands.

William Smith Clark (July 31, 1826 – March 9, 1886) was a professor of chemistry, botany and zoology, a colonel during the American Civil War, and a leader in agricultural education. Raised and schooled in Easthampton, Massachusetts, Clark spent most of his adult life in Amherst, Massachusetts.  He graduated from Amherst College in 1848 and obtained a doctorate in chemistry from Georgia Augusta University in Göttingen in 1852.  He then served as professor of chemistry at Amherst College from 1852 to 1867.  During the Civil War, he was granted leave from Amherst to serve with the 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, eventually achieving the rank of colonel and the command of that unit.Browne, 2–3.
In 1867, Clark became the third president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He was the first to appoint a faculty and admit a class of students. Although initially successful, MAC was criticized by politicians and newspaper editors who felt it was a waste of funding in a state that was growing increasingly industrial. Farmers of western Massachusetts were slow to support the college. Despite these obstacles, Clark's success in organizing an innovative academic institution earned him international attention.  Japanese officials, striving to achieve rapid modernization of that country in the wake of the Meiji Restoration, were especially intrigued by Clark's work.Maki, 124–125.
In 1876, the Japanese government hired Clark as a foreign advisor to establish the Sapporo Agricultural College (SAC), now Hokkaido University.  During his eight months in Sapporo, Clark successfully organized SAC, had a significant impact on the scientific and economic development of the island of Hokkaido, and made a lasting imprint on Japanese culture.  Clark's visage overlooks Sapporo from several statues and his parting words to his Japanese students, "Boys, be ambitious!" have become a nationally known motto in Japan.Maki, xv–xvi.
After resigning the presidency of MAC in 1879, Clark left academia to become the president of a mining company, Clark & Bothwell. The company, in operation from 1881 to 1882, purchased several silver mines, mostly in Utah and California. Clark's partner, John R. Bothwell, proved to be corrupt and the company quickly folded, destroying Clark's reputation, his own finances and the fortunes of many of his friends and family. The subsequent scandal ruined Clark's health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.Maki, 267–272.

[[Synoptic scale meteorology]]

CATEGORIES: Weather, Storm

The synoptic scale in meteorology (also known as large scale or cyclonic scale) is a horizontal length scale of the order of 1000 kilometres (about 620 miles) or more.American Meteorological Society. Cyclonic scale. Retrieved on 10 May 2007. This corresponds to a horizontal scale typical of mid-latitude depressions (e.g. extratropical cyclones).  Most high and low-pressure areas seen on weather maps such as surface weather analyses are synoptic-scale systems, driven by the location of Rossby waves in their respective hemisphere.  Low-pressure areas and their related frontal zones occur on the leading edge of a trough within the Rossby wave pattern, while surface highs form on the back edge of the trough.  Most precipitation areas occur near frontal zones.  The word synoptic is derived from the Greek word [tpl]lang|grc|συνοπτικός[/tpl] ([tpl]transl|grc|synoptikos[/tpl]), meaning seen together.
The Navier–Stokes equations applied to atmospheric motion can be simplified by scale analysis in the synoptic scale. It can be shown that the main terms in horizontal equations are Coriolis force and pressure gradient terms; therefore, one can use geostrophic approximation.  In vertical coordinates, the momentum equation simplifies to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation.

[[History of Manchuria]]

CATEGORIES: History of Manchuria, Balhae, History of Northeast Asia, History of Korea, History of Russia by locality

Manchuria is a region in East Asia. Depending on the definition of its extent, Manchuria can either refer to a region falling entirely within China, or a larger region today divided between Northeast China and the Russian Far East. To differentiate between the two parts following the latter definition, the Russian part is also known as Outer Manchuria in English, while the Chinese part is known as Inner Manchuria.
It is the homeland of the Manchu people, the designation introduced in 1636 for the Jurchen people, in origin a Tungusic people which took power in 17th century China, establishing the Qing Dynasty that lasted until 1912. The population grew from about 1 million in 1750 to 5 million in 1850 and 14 million in 1900, largely because of the immigration of Chinese farmers. 
Lying at the juncture of the Chinese, Japanese and Russian spheres of influence, Manchuria has been a cockpit of conflict since the late 19th century. The Russian Empire established control over the northern part of Manchuria in 1860 (Beijing Treaty); it built a railway to consolidate its hold.  Disputes over Manchuria and Korea led to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 to 1905. The Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931, setting up the puppet state of Manchukuo which became a centerpiece of the fast-growing Japanese Empire. The Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945 led to the overnight collapse of Japanese rule. Manchuria was a base of operations for the Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army in the Chinese Civil War, leading to the formation of the People's Republic of China. In the Korean War, Chinese forces used Manchuria as a base to assist North Korea against the UN forces. During the Cold War era,  Manchuria became a matter of contention, escalating to the Sino–Soviet border conflict in 1969. The Sino-Russian border dispute was resolved diplomatically only in 2004.  In recent years there has been extensive scholarship on Manchuria in the 20th century, while the earlier period is less studied.

[[Latin alphabets]]

CATEGORIES: Latin alphabets, Collation

A Latin or Roman alphabet is an alphabet that uses the letters of the Latin script, the basis of the original Roman Latin alphabet. Extension of the Latin script may be through adding diacritics to existing letters, fusing letters together into ligatures, adding new letters, or treating pairs or triplets of letters as units (digraphs and trigraphs). 
These added letters are often given a place in the alphabet by defining an alphabetical order or collation sequence, which can vary between languages. Some, especially those with diacritics, are not considered distinct letters for this purpose: French é and German ö, for example, are not used in the commonly quoted alphabet sequences. In some languages, digraphs are included in the collation sequence (eg Hungarian CS, Welsh RH).
The ISO basic Latin alphabet includes the 26 basic letters that are included in most alphabets. The International Phonetic Alphabet is also derived mainly from the Latin script. 
The tables below summarize and compare some of the alphabets. In this article, the scope of the word "alphabet" is broadened to include letters with tone marks and other diacritics used to represent a wide range of orthographic traditions found in modern and classical literature, without special regard as to whether the modified letters have their own traditional alphabetic place or are interfiled, or whether the letters are in the sequence in the table or elsewhere.

[[Dewey Square Tunnel]]
CATEGORIES: Tunnels in Massachusetts, Transportation in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. Route 1, Interstate 93, Buildings and structures in Boston, Massachusetts, Tunnels completed in 1959

The Dewey Square Tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, is part of Interstate 93 (concurrent with US 1 and Route 3), running under the heart of the city's financial district, including Dewey Square. Built in 1959, it was part of Boston's Central Artery freeway construction project of the 1950s.http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/central-artery/ Known to locals as the South Station Tunnel (due to its proximity to the city's main train station), the Dewey Square Tunnel is of cut-and-cover design, and originally was six lanes wide (three in each direction), with no breakdown lanes.
Because of public outcry during construction of The Central Artery, elevated for most of its length and reviled because it cut off views of and access to Boston's historic waterfront, it was decided by then-Governor John A. Volpe that the final section of the artery was to be put underground from just south of Congress Street to Kneeland Street near Boston's Chinatown section.  At the time of its construction, it was the widest vehicular tunnel in the world.
At one time, a bus terminal serving Peter Pan, Bonanza, and other regional bus lines sat atop the tunnel near its northern portal.  That bus station has since been relocated to the major intermodal transportation hub at South Station.
The lack of breakdown lanes, the limited number of travel lanes, and the myriad access ramps to and from the Artery and the tunnel caused massive traffic jams and gridlock, forcing transportation officials to consider rebuilding the Artery and putting it totally underground. The Dewey Square Tunnel received new life as part of the massive Big Dig project of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The tunnel was rehabilitated and now serves as exclusive southbound lanes of Interstate 93, complete with a new ventilation system and gently banked corners consistent with appropriate superelevation.  Its old northern portal at Congress Street was connected to the underground southbound lanes of the new artery in 2005.
A long-closed northbound off-ramp to Chinatown was rebuilt and reopened as a southbound on-ramp from Surface Road. The refurbished tunnel, with 6 lanes at its widest point, was fully opened on March 5, 2005. The Dewey Square Tunnel is the only remaining section of the original Central Artery still in use.  Since the completion of the Big Dig project, the name "Dewey Square (South Station) Tunnel" has fallen into general disuse; instead, it is considered to be part of the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel, a name used for the entire length of the north-south tunnel system.

[[Protecting group]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical synthesis, Protecting groups

A protecting group or protective group is introduced into a molecule by chemical modification of a functional group to obtain chemoselectivity in a subsequent chemical reaction. It plays an important role in multistep organic synthesis. 
In many preparations of delicate organic compounds, some specific parts of their molecules cannot survive the required reagents or chemical environments. Then, these parts, or groups, must be protected. For example, lithium aluminium hydride is a highly reactive but useful reagent capable of reducing esters to alcohols. It will always react with carbonyl groups, and this cannot be discouraged by any means. When a reduction of an ester is required in the presence of a carbonyl, the attack of the hydride on the carbonyl has to be prevented. For example, the carbonyl is converted into an acetal, which does not react with hydrides. The acetal is then called a protecting group for the carbonyl. After the step involving the hydride is complete, the acetal is removed (by reacting it with an aqueous acid), giving back the original carbonyl. This step is called deprotection.  
Protecting groups are more commonly used in small-scale laboratory work and initial development than in industrial production processes because their use adds additional steps and material costs to the process. However, the availability of a cheap chiral building block can overcome these additional costs (e.g. shikimic acid for oseltamivir).

[[IRAF]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomy software, Cross-platform software

IRAF (image reduction and analysis facility) is a collection of software written at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) geared towards the reduction of astronomical images in pixel array form. This is primarily data taken from imaging array detectors such as CCDs. It is available for all major operating systems for mainframes and desktop computers. Although written for UNIX-like operating systems, use on Microsoft Windows is made possible by Cygwin. It is primarily used on Linux distributions, with a growing share of Mac OS X users.
IRAF commands (known as tasks) are organized into package structures. Additional packages may be added to IRAF. Packages may contain other packages. There are many packages available by NOAO and external developers often focusing on a particular branch of research or facility. Of particular note are the STSDAS and TABLES packages by the STScI.
Just a few examples of functionality available in IRAF would be calibration of the fluxes and positions of astronomical objects within an image, compensation for sensitivity variations between detector pixels, combination of multiple images or measurement of the redshifts of absorption or emission lines in a spectrum.

John Robert Clynes PC (27 March 1869 – 23 October 1949)[tpl]Rayment-hc|m|1|date=March 2012[/tpl] was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician.  He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 35 years, and as leader of the Labour Party (from 14 February 1921 to 21 November 1922), led the party in its breakthrough at the 1922 general election. He was the first Englishman to serve as leader of the Labour Party
The son of a labourer named Patrick Clynes, he was born in Oldham, Lancashire, and began work in a local cotton mill when he was 10 years old. At the age of 16, he wrote a series of articles about child labour in the textile industry, and a year later he helped form the Piercers' Union.
In 1892, Clynes became an organiser for the Lancashire Gasworkers' Union and came in contact with the Fabian Society. Having joined the Independent Labour Party, he attended the 1900 conference where the Labour Representation Committee was formed; this committee soon afterwards became the Labour Party. 
Clynes stood for the new party in the 1906 general election and was elected to Parliament for Manchester North East, becoming one of Labour's bright stars. In 1910 he became the party's deputy chairman.
During the First World War Clynes was a supporter of British military involvement (in which he differed from Ramsay MacDonald), and in 1917 became Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Food Control in the Lloyd George coalition government. The next year he was appointed Minister of Food Control, and at the 1918 general election he was returned to Parliament for the Manchester Platting constituency.
Clynes became leader of the party in 1921, and led it through its major breakthrough in the 1922 general election. Before that election, Labour only had 52 seats in parliament; but as a result of the election, Labour's total number of seats rose to 142.
MacDonald had resigned as Labour leader in 1914, due to his wartime pacifism, and at the 1918 general election he lost his seat. Not for another four years did he return to the House of Commons. By that stage, MacDonald's pacifism had been forgiven. When the occupant of the Labour leadership had to be decided on through a vote of Labour parliamentarians, MacDonald narrowly defeated Clynes.
When MacDonald became Prime Minister he made Clynes the party's leader in the Commons until the government was defeated in 1924. During the second MacDonald government of 1929–1931, Clynes served as Home Secretary. In this role, Clynes gained literary prominence, when he explained in the Commons his refusal to grant a visa 
to the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, then living in exile in Turkey, who had been invited by Ramsay MacDonald's party to give a lecture in Britain. Clynes had then been immortalized by the scathing criticism of Clynes' concept of the right to asylum, voiced by Trotsky in the last chapter of his autobiography "My Life" entitled "The planet without visa".
In 1931, Clynes sided with Arthur Henderson and George Lansbury, against MacDonald's support for austerity measures to deal with the Great Depression. Clynes split with MacDonald when the latter left Labour to form a National Government. In the 1931 election, Clynes was one of the casualties, losing his Manchester Platting seat. Nevertheless he regained this constituency in 1935, and then remained in the House of Commons until his retirement ten years later at the 1945 general election.
He died in 1949. He had married Mary Harper, a mill worker, in 1893.

[[History of cryptography]]
CATEGORIES: History of cryptography, Classical cryptography, Military communications, History of telecommunications

Cryptography, the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, began thousands of years ago. Until recent decades, it has been the story of what might be called  classic cryptography — that is, of methods of encryption that use pen and paper, or perhaps simple mechanical aids. In the early 20th century, the invention of complex mechanical and electromechanical machines, such as the Enigma rotor machine, provided more sophisticated and efficient means of encryption; and the subsequent introduction of electronics and computing has allowed elaborate schemes of still greater complexity, most of which are entirely unsuited to pen and paper.
The development of cryptography has been paralleled by the development of cryptanalysis —  the "breaking" of codes and ciphers. The discovery and application, early on, of frequency analysis to the reading of encrypted communications has, on occasion, altered the course of history.  Thus the Zimmermann Telegram triggered the United States' entry into World War I; and Allied reading of Nazi Germany's ciphers shortened World War II, in some evaluations by as much as two years.
Until the 1970s, secure cryptography was largely the preserve of governments. Two events have since brought it squarely into the public domain: the creation of a public encryption standard (DES), and the invention of public-key cryptography.
