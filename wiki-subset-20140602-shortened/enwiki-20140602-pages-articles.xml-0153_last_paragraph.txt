CATEGORIES: Popes, Italian popes, 10th-century archbishops, 996 deaths, People of medieval Rome, 10th-century Italian people, Year of birth unknown

Pope John XV ([tpl]lang-la|Ioannes XV[/tpl]; born in Rome, died April 1 996) was Pope from August 985 to his death in 996. He succeeded Boniface VII. He was said to have been Pope after another Pope John who reigned four months after Pope John XIV (983–984) and was named "Papa Ioannes XIV Bis" or "Pope John XIVb". This supposed second John XIV never existed, rather he was confused with a certain cardinal deacon John, son of Robert, who was opposed to Boniface VII and is now excluded from the papal lists.

Damn Yankees is a musical comedy with a book by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop and music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross.  The story is a modern retelling of the Faust legend set during the 1950s in Washington, D.C., during a time when the New York Yankees dominated Major League Baseball.  The musical is based on Wallop's novel The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant.  
Damn Yankees ran for 1,019 performances in its original 1955 Broadway production.  Adler and Ross's success with The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees seemed to point to a bright future for them, but Ross suddenly died of chronic bronchiectasis, at the age of twenty-nine, a few months after Damn Yankees opened.

The term gained fame in 1980s Britain, when out-of-the-ordinary sitcoms like "The Young Ones" or "Absolutely Fabulous" popped up, and continued in America with unorthodox sketch comedy groups such as Manhattan’s Upright Citizen’s Brigade. But, according to Rosen of the "Pie Hole Comedy Show" in Brooklyn, New York, alternative comedy predates all of those acts. "Mel Brooks was an alternative comic," said Rosen, citing his famous 2000-Year-Old Man routine. "So is Steve Martin." And Rosen’s influences also include old masters like filmmaker Woody Allen, who started his career as a standup. "There’s a whole world of alternative comedy rooms, in bars and basements."

Patton Oswalt has defined it as "comedy where the audience has no pre-set expectations about the crowd, and vice versa. In comedy clubs, there tends to be a certain vibe—alternative comedy explores different types of material."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.altcomfestival.com/pressArticle6.php | title=Patton Oswalt | work= Panorama Magazine| date=5 May 2008| publisher=AltCom!| accessdate=2009-10-30 [/tpl]
After his performance in Young Adult, Oswalt clarified the method and attitude of the alt comics he came up with as, "Don't try it, man. Just go up and wing it". He goes on to say how it affected his acting, "I didn’t really have the confidence to in the work...I think a lot of that comes from insecurity. It’s that fashion of improv and amateurism that comes from the insecurity of saying to the audience, 'Well, it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t go well, because I didn’t even try that hard to begin with.' It’s like, 'Oh, that’s why you’re not trying. If you actually tried hard and it sucked, then you’ve got to blame yourself.' So that’s what makes it hard for some people to sit down and actually just do the fucking work, because doing the work means you’re making a commitment."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/patton-oswalt-on-his-most-memorable-roles-and-givi,88860/2/ | title=Patton Oswalt on his most memorable roles and giving life advice to Dane Cook | work= Random Roles| date=9 November 2012| publisher=A.V.

Pope John XVIII ([tpl]lang-la|Ioannes XVIII[/tpl]; died June or July 1009) was Pope and ruler of the Papal states from January 1004 (25 December 1003 - NS) to his abdication in June 1009. He was born Fasanius at Rapagnano, near Ascoli Piceno, the son of a Roman priest named Leo.
During his whole pontificate he was allegedly subordinate to the head of the Crescentii clan who controlled Rome, the patricius (an aristocratic military leader) John Crescentius III. 
This period was disrupted by continuing conflicts between the Ottonian Emperor Henry II and Arduin of Ivrea, who had styled himself King of Italy in 1002 after the death of Emperor Otto III. Rome was wracked with bouts of plague, and Saracens operated freely out of the Emirate of Sicily ravaging the Tyrrhenian coasts.
As Pope, John XVIII occupied his time mainly with details of ecclesiastical administration. He authorized a new Diocese of Bamberg to serve as a base for missionary activity among the Slavs, a concern of Henry II's. He also adjudicated a squabble between the abbot of Fleury and the bishops of Sens and Orléans.Richard P. McBrien, Lives of the Popes: The Pontiffs from St. Peter to Benedict XVI, (HarperCollins Publishers, 2000) ISBN 978-0060878078. P. 168. 
Ultimately he abdicated and, according to one catalog of Popes, retired to a monastery, where he died shortly afterwards. His successor was Pope Sergius IV.

[[One-way function]]
CATEGORIES: Cryptography, Cryptographic primitives, Unsolved problems in computer science

In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input.  Here, "easy" and "hard" are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems. Not being one-to-one is not considered sufficient of a function for it to be called one-way (see Theoretical Definition, below).
The existence of such one-way functions is still an open conjecture.  In fact, their existence would prove that the complexity classes P and NP are not equal, thus resolving the foremost unsolved question of theoretical computer science.Oded Goldreich (2001). Foundations of Cryptography: Volume 1, Basic Tools, (draft available from author's site). Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-79172-3. (see also http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/foc-book.html) [tpl]rp|ex. 2.2, page 70[/tpl] The converse is not true, i.e. the existence of a proof that P and NP are not equal would not directly imply the existence of one-way functions.Goldwasser, S. and Bellare, M. "Lecture Notes on Cryptography". Summer course on cryptography, MIT, 1996–2001
In applied contexts, the terms "easy" and "hard" are usually interpreted relative to some specific computing entity; typically "cheap enough for the legitimate users" and "prohibitively expensive for any malicious agents". One-way functions, in this sense, are fundamental tools for cryptography, personal identification, authentication, and other data security applications.  While the existence of one-way functions in this sense is also an open conjecture, there are several candidates that have withstood decades of intense scrutiny.  Some of them are essential ingredients of most telecommunications, e-commerce, and e-banking systems around the world.

Ethidium bromide is an intercalating agent commonly used as a fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) in molecular biology laboratories for techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis.

The Regional Municipality of Niagara, also known as the Niagara Region, or colloquially "Regional Niagara", is a regional municipality comprising twelve municipalities of Southern Ontario, Canada.
The region occupies most of the Niagara Peninsula. Its eastern boundary is the Niagara River, which is also the border with the United States. It is bounded on the north by Lake Ontario and on the south by Lake Erie.
Unique natural landscapes make the Niagara Region an important centre for agriculture and tourism in Canada. The most important agricultural enterprise in Niagara is viticulture, or winemaking. The Niagara Wine Route, which connects visitors to dozens of wineries, is a growing tourism draw while the internationally-renowned Niagara Falls is one of Canada's major tourist attractions.  Along with Shaw Festival, held annually in Niagara-on-the-Lake, and the Welland Canal, the Regional Municipality of Niagara receives up to 12 million visitors each year.

[[Hugh Edwin Strickland]]

Hugh Edwin Strickland (2 March 1811 – 14 September 1853) was an English geologist, ornithologist, naturalist, and systematist.
Strickland was born at Reighton, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He was the second son of Henry Eustatius Strickland of Apperley, Gloucestershire, by his wife Mary, daughter of Edmund Cartwright, inventor of the power loom, and grandson of Sir George Strickland, bart., of Boynton. In 1827 he was sent as a pupil to Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), a family friend.Wikisource
As a boy he acquired a taste for natural history which dominated his life. He received his early education from private tutors and in 1829 entered Oriel College, Oxford. He attended the anatomical lectures of John Kidd and the geological lectures of William Buckland and he became interested both in zoology and geology. He graduated B.A. in 1831, and proceeded to M.A. in the following year. He married Catherine Dorcas Maule Jardine, the daughter of Sir William Jardine, in 1845.http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I8517&ged=auden-bicknell.ged She drew many of the illustrations for Contributions to Ornithology, which were reproduced by papyrography, a process described by Strickland in the first volume of that journal.
Returning to his home at Cracombe House, near Tewkesbury, he began to study the geology of the Vale of Evesham, communicating papers to the Geological Society of London (1833 - 1834). He also gave much attention to ornithology. Becoming acquainted with Roderick Murchison he was introduced to William John Hamilton (1805 - 1867) and accompanied him in 1835 on a journey through Asia Minor, the Thracian Bosporus and the island of Zante. Hamilton afterwards published the results of this journey and of his subsequent excursion to Armenia in Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Armenia (1842).
After his return in 1836 Strickland brought before the Geological Society several papers on the geology of the districts he had visited in southern Europe and Asia. He also described in detail the "drift deposits in the counties of Worcester and Warwick, drawing particular attention to the fluviatile deposits of Cropthorne in which remains of hippopotamus, &c., were found". With Murchison he read before the Geological Society an important paper On the Upper Formations of the New Red Sandstone System in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire (Trans. Geol. Soc., 1840). In other papers he described the Bristol Bone-bed near Tewkesbury and the Ludlow Bone-bed of Woolhope. He was author likewise of ornithological memoirs communicated to the Zoological Society, the Annals and Magazine of Natural History and the British Association. He also drew up the report, in 1842, of a committee appointed by the British Association to consider the rules of zoological nomenclature.  This report is the earliest formal codification of the principle of priority, which represents the fundamental guiding precept that preserves the stability of biological nomenclature.
He was one of the founders of the Ray Society, suggested in 1843 and established in 1844, the object being the publication of works on natural history which could not be undertaken by scientific societies or by publishers. For this society Strickland corrected, enlarged and edited the manuscript of Agassiz for the Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae (1848). In 1845 he edited with J. Buckman a second and enlarged edition of Murchison's Outline of the Geology of the neighbourhood of Cheltenham. In 1846 he settled at Oxford, and two years later he issued in conjunction with Alexander Gordon Melville a work on The Dodo and its kindred (1848).
In 1850 he was appointed deputy reader in geology at Oxford during the illness of Buckland, and in 1852 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, after attending the meeting of the British Association at Hull, he went to examine the cuttings on the Manchester Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway near Retford. There he was knocked down and killed by a train; on a double track he stepped out of the way of a goods train and was hit by an express coming in the opposite direction. He was buried at Deerhurst church near Tewkesbury, where a memorial window was erected.
His Ornithological Synonyms was published in 1855. His collection of 6,000 birds went to Cambridge in 1867. Whilst travelling in 1835 he discovered the Olive-tree Warbler on the island of Zante, and the Cinereous Bunting in the vicinity of İzmir in western Turkey.
His name was honoured in the name of a bird endemic to N.Borneo, Copsychus stricklandii Motley & Dillwyn (1855) Three Men and a Bird: Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol.86, Part 1, pp.113-119 (June 2013)

[[Newtonian fluid]]

CATEGORIES: Viscosity, Fluid dynamics

In continum mechanics, a fluid is said to be Newtonian if the viscous stresses that arise from its flow, at every point, are proportional to the local strain rate — the rate of change of its deformation over time.[tpl]cite book | author=G. K. Batchelor| title=An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics| publisher=Cambridge Mathematical Library series, Cambridge University Press | year=2000 | origyear=1967 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=Rla7OihRvUgC&lpg=PP1&dq=An%20Introduction%20to%20Fluid%20Dynamics&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q | isbn=0-521-66396-2[/tpl]

More precisely, a fluid is Newtonian only if the tensors that describe the viscous stress and the strain rate are related by a constant viscosity tensor that does not depend on the stress state and velocity of the flow.  If the fluid is also isotropic (that is, its mechanical properties are the same along any direction), the viscosity tensor reduces to two real coefficients, describing the fluid's resistance to continuous shear deformation and continuous compression or expansion, respectively.
Newtonian fluids are the simplest mathematical models of fluids that account for viscosity. While no real fluid fits the definition perfectly, many common liquids and gases, such as water and air, can be assumed to be Newtonian for practical calculations under ordinary conditions. However, non-Newtonian fluids are relatively common, and include oobleck (which becomes stiffer when vigorously sheared), or non-drip paint (which becomes thinner when sheared). Other examples include many polymer solutions (which exhibit the Weissenberg effect), molten polymers, many solid suspensions, blood, and most highly viscous fluids.
Newtonian fluids are named after Isaac Newton, who first derived the relation between the rate of shear strain rate and shear stress for such fluids in differential form.

The Comedians is a British television show of the 1970s (later reprised in the mid-1980s and early 1990s) produced by Johnnie Hamp of Granada Television. The show gave a stage to nightclub and working men's club comedians of the era, including Russ Abbot, Lennie Bennett, Stan Boardman, Jim Bowen, Jimmy Bright, Duggie Brown, Mike Burton, Dave Butler, Brian Carroll, Frank Carson, Mike Coyne, Jimmy Cricket, Colin Crompton, Pauline Daniels, Charlie Daze, Vince Earl, Steve Faye, Eddie Flanagan, Stu Francis, Ken Goodwin, Jackie Hamilton, Jerry Harris, George King, Bobby Knutt, Bernard Manning, Mike McCabe, Paul Melba, Mick Miller, Hal Nolan, Tom O'Connor, Tom Pepper, Bryn Phillips, Mike Reid, George Roper, Harry Scott, Sammy Thomas, Johnny Wager, Roy Walker, Charlie Williams, Lee Wilson and Lenny Windsor.
Also featured on the TV show, were Shep's Banjo Boys, a 7-piece band comprising (for the first 5 series) Charlie Bentley (tenor banjo), John Drury (sousaphone), Andy Holdorf (trombone), John Orchard (piano), John Rollings (drums), Graham Shepherd (banjo) and Howard Shepherd (lead banjo). In 1973, the line up was Mike Dexter (banjo), Tony "Tosh" Kennedy (sousaphone), Ged Martin (drums), Tony Pritchard (trombone), Graham Shepherd (banjo) and Howard "Shep" Shepherd (lead banjo).
The Comedians began as an experiment for Granada TV. Filmed before a live audience in Manchester, comics each performed 20-minute sets, which were then edited together into half-hour shows. Each edition featured up to ten stand-up comics.
Working men's clubs are numerous in Britain, especially in North East England and have been a useful training ground for artists, especially comedians. Most of these clubs are affiliated to the CIU (Working Men's Club and Institute Union) founded in 1862 by the Rev. Henry Solly. There are also political clubs, as well as Servicemen's Clubs affiliated to the Royal British Legion.
It was remarkably popular during the earlier series. An LP recording of the show reached the best-seller charts, several sell-out national tours followed, including a season at the London Palladium, and the programme won the Critics' circle Award.
The comedy frequently took the form of anecdotes or jokes and often involved racist or sexist stereotypes. Like other British comedy successes of the day, notably, Love thy neighbour, this kind of entertainment was acceptable on British television during this period but would not be so today. Viewing the series in retrospect it stands as a major social document of the times.
In recent years, the series has been repeated on the (now defunct) British satellite television channel Plus, and can now be bought, on DVD, having been released by Network.

Star 80 is a 1983 American film about the true story of Playboy Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered by her estranged husband Paul Snider in 1980. The film was directed by Bob Fosse, and starred Mariel Hemingway and Eric Roberts.
The film was shot on location in Vancouver, British Columbia and Los Angeles, California; the death scene was filmed in the same house in which the murder-suicide actually took place. The story is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Village Voice article "Death of a Playmate" by Teresa Carpenter; the film's title was taken from Snider's vanity license plates.
Star 80 was the second movie based on the murder of Stratten. It was preceded by the 1981 television film Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story in which Jamie Lee Curtis portrayed Stratten and Bruce Weitz portrayed Paul Snider.
Roberts earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Dramatic Actor for his performance in the film. Star 80 was the last film Fosse directed.

The act extended the territorial application of the initial embargo to apply to foreign companies trading with Cuba, and penalized foreign companies allegedly "trafficking" in property formerly owned by U.S. citizens but confiscated by Cuba after the Cuban revolution. The act also covers property formerly owned by Cubans who have since become U.S. citizens.http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp98/rp98-114.pdf
The Act is named for its original sponsors, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana.
The law was passed on March 12, 1996 by the 104th United States Congress.  The bill, which had been tabled in late 1995 after Senator Helms was unable to overcome several Democratic filibusters, was reintroduced prompted by an episode that happened a month earlier.

[[Mycoprotein]]

CATEGORIES: Proteins

Mycoprotein (also known as fungal protein) is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as "the albuminoid which is the principal constituent of the protoplasm of the cell." "Myco" is from the Greek word for "fungus".
Mycoprotein means protein from fungi. The main mycoprotein on sale in Europe and North America is called Quorn. It was originally developed as a food source to combat food shortages. Mycoprotein Story
A fungus called Fusarium venenatum is the main source of mycoprotein. The fungus is grown in vats using glucose syrup as food. A fermentation vat is filled with the growth medium, and then inoculated with the fungal spores. The Fusarium venenatum culture  respires aerobically, so for it to grow at an optimum rate, it is supplied with oxygen, and carbon dioxide is drawn from the vat. To make protein, nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) is added, and vitamins and minerals are needed to support growth. The vat is kept at a constant temperature, also optimized for growth; the fungus can double its mass every five hours.
When the desired amount of mycoprotein has been created, the growth medium is drawn off from a tap at the bottom of the fermenter. The mycoprotein is separated and purified. It is a pale yellow solid with a faint taste of mushrooms. Different flavours and tastes can be added to the mycoprotein to add variety.
The protein is a form of single cell protein (SCP) and was first produced in the early 1980s.
About one in 140,000 consumers are sensitive to mycoproteins.[tpl]cite journal | pmid =     12743577 | year =     2003 | last1 =     Hoff | first1 =     M | last2 =     Trüeb | first2 =     RM | last3 =     Ballmer-Weber | first3 =     BK | last4 =     Vieths | first4 =     S | last5 =     Wuethrich | first5 =     B | title =     Immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction to ingestion of mycoprotein (Quorn) in a patient allergic to molds caused by acidic ribosomal protein P2 | volume =     111 | issue =     5 | pages =     1106–10 | journal =     The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology | doi=10.1067/mai.2003.1339[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 12401831 | year = 2002 | last1 = Katona | first1 = SJ | last2 = Kaminski | first2 = ER | title = Sensitivity to Quorn mycoprotein (Fusarium venenatum) in a mould allergic patient | volume = 55 | issue = 11 | pages = 876–7 | pmc = 1769805 | journal = Journal of clinical pathology[/tpl] The Center for Science in the Public Interest claims this may result in "vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, hives and potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions."Chemical Cuisine: Learn about Food Additives, Center for Science in the Public Interest

A dispute between two leading dynastic families of medieval Ireland, the Butlers, (Earls of Ormond) and the FitzGeralds, (Earls of Kildare) was resolved in 1492 by a brave act and a magnanimous response.   Black James, nephew of the Earl of Ormond, fleeing from FitzGerald's Geraldine soldiers, took sanctuary in the chapter house of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. Though he had the upper hand, with his soldiers surrounding Black James and his men, Gearóid Mór FitzGerald, Ireland's premier earl, wished to end the bloody feud between both families. He pleaded with Black James through the Chapter House's oak door to meet him to negotiate a peace. Black James rebuffed all requests. FitzGerald ordered his soldiers to cut a hole in the centre of the door. Then, having explained how he wished to see peace between the families, the Earl thrust his hand and arm through the hole to shake hands with Black James. It was a risky venture; any of Black James's heavily armed men could have hacked the Earl's arm off; however, James shook his hand and ended the dispute.

[[Metacentric height]]

CATEGORIES: Geometric centers, Buoyancy, Ship measurements

The metacentric height (GM) is a measurement of the initial static stability of a floating body.  It is calculated as the distance between the centre of gravity of a ship and its metacentre. A larger metacentric height implies greater initial stability against overturning.  Metacentric height also has implication on the natural period of rolling of a hull, with very large metacentric heights being associated with shorter periods of roll which are uncomfortable for passengers.  Hence, a sufficiently high but not excessively high metacentric height is considered ideal for passenger ships.

It was located in the southernmost part of the country, encompassing the whole of today's Republic of Macedonia, southern parts of Southern and Eastern Serbia and southeastern parts of Kosovo (Serbia). It was named after the Vardar River and its administrative capital was the city of Skopje.
According to the 1930 statistics of the Central Press Bureau of the Ministerial Council published in the: Central Press Bureau of the Ministerial Council, Belgrade 1930 out of the 9 Yugoslav banovinas, the “Vardarska” banovina was the largest at 38,879km2; while its population, was the fourth at 1,386,370 inhabitants. It also suffered the worst health problems, especially typhus and smallpox, and required one Institute of Hygiene, 3 health stations and 6 dispensaries and convalescent homes.

Force H was a British naval formation during the Second World War. It was formed in 1940 to replace French naval power in the western Mediterranean that had been removed by the French armistice with Nazi Germany.
It occupied an odd place within the naval chain of command. Normal British practice was to have various naval stations and fleets around the world whose commanders reported to the First Sea Lord via a flag officer. Force H was based at Gibraltar, but there was already a flag officer at the base - Flag Officer Commanding, North Atlantic. However, the commanding officer of Force H did not report to this officer; instead, he reported directly to the First Sea Lord.

[[Hill climbing]]

CATEGORIES: Optimization algorithms and methods, Search algorithms

In computer science, hill climbing is a mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family of local search. It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by incrementally changing a single element of the solution. If the change produces a better solution, an incremental change is made to the new solution, repeating until no further improvements can be found.
For example, hill climbing can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. It is easy to find an initial solution that visits all the cities but will be very poor compared to the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with such a solution and makes small improvements to it, such as switching the order in which two cities are visited. Eventually, a much shorter route is likely to be obtained.
Hill climbing is good for finding a local optimum (a solution that cannot be improved by considering a neighbouring configuration) but it is not guaranteed to find the best possible solution (the global optimum) out of all possible solutions (the search space).
The characteristic that only local optima are guaranteed can be cured by using restarts (repeated local search), or more complex schemes based 
on iterations, like iterated local search, on memory, 
like reactive search optimization and tabu search, 
or memory-less stochastic modifications, like simulated annealing.
The relative simplicity of the algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node. Choice of next node and starting node can be varied to give a list of related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well. Hill climbing can often produce a better result than other algorithms when the amount of time available to perform a search is limited, such as with real-time systems.
It is an anytime algorithm:
it can return a valid solution even if it's interrupted at any time before it ends.

Route 181 is a [tpl]convert|7.47|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] state highway in Jefferson Township and Sparta Township in New Jersey, which is in the United States. The highway begins in Jefferson Township at an interchange with New Jersey Route 15 and Weldon Road, where that road changes from a divided surface road to a four-lane freeway. The highway heads through Sparta Township, and indirectly interchanges several times with Route 15. The highway continues through downtown Sparta, where it intersects with several county highways. Route 181 continues north out of Sparta, ending at an intersection with Route 15 at the northern end of the NJ 15 freeway in Sparta Township.
Route 181 is a former alignment of Route 15, which remained on that alignment for 21 years. In 1974, construction began on a new bypass of downtown Sparta. Route 15 was reassigned onto the bypass, and Route 181 was assigned onto the former alignment of Route 15.

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Warren County, New Jersey

Route 182 is a [tpl]convert|0.96|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] state highway in Hackettstown, New Jersey, United States. The highway serves as a connector of Route 57 to U.S. Route 46. The southern end of Route 182 is at a three-way intersection, where Route 57 heads westbound towards Phillipsburg. Also present at this intersection is Warren County Route 517, which is signed as New Jersey Route 24, but not maintained by the state. County Route 517 runs concurrent with Route 182 to its north end at U.S. Route 46, and turns west with US 46 before splitting in downtown Hackettstown.
Route 182 was first an alignment of pre-1927 Route 12, but was not maintained by the state. In 1927, there was a renumbering, and it became part of New Jersey Route S-24, which was a spur of Route 24. Route 24 at the time went along the alignment of Route 57, but when the second renumbering occurred in 1953, there was yet another change. In 1953, Route 24 was realigned onto most of Route S24, except for a short part which was designated Route 57. The highway went through a final change on October 9, 1969. On that day, there was a small renumbering of Hackettstown, with Route 24 being truncated to the three-way intersection, and Route 57 reassigned onto the rest of Route 24. The former alignment of Route 57 was reassigned as New Jersey Route 182.

[[Psychology of self]]

CATEGORIES: Self, Conceptions of self, Ego psychology

The psychology of self is the study of either the cognitive, conative or affective representation of one's identity or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology derived from the distinction between the self as I, the subjective knower, and the self as Me, the object that is known.James, W. (1891).  The Principles of Psychology, Vol.1. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1891)
Current views of the self in psychology position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and social identity.Sedikides, C. & Spencer, S. J. (Eds.) (2007). The Self. New York: Psychology Press It may be the case that we can now usefully attempt to ground experience of self in a neural process with cognitive consequences, which will give us insight into the elements of which the complex multiply situated selves of modern identity are composed.
The self has many facets that help make up integral parts of it, such as self-awareness, self-esteem, self-knowledge, and self-perception. All parts of the self enable people to alter, change, add, and modify aspects of themselves in order to gain social acceptance in society. “Probably the best account of the origins of selfhood is that the self comes into being at the interface between the inner biological processes of the human body and the sociocultural network to which the person belongs.” Baumeister, Roy F., and Brad J. Bushman. "The Self." Social Psychology and Human Nature. 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2011. 57-96. Print.

[[RobotWar]]

CATEGORIES: 1981 video games, Apple II games, Apple II-only games, Programming games, Video games set in 2002, Fictional wars

RobotWar was a programming game written by Silas Warner.  This game, along with the companion program RobotWrite, was originally developed in the TUTOR programming language language on the PLATO system in the 1970s. Later the game was commercialized and adapted for the Apple II family of computers and published by Muse Software in 1981.  The premise was that in the distant future of 2002, war was declared hazardous to human health, and now countries settled their differences in a battle arena full of combat robots.  As the manual stated, "The task set before you is: to program a robot, that no other robot can destroy!"
The main activity of the game was to write a computer program that would operate a (simulated) robot. The player could then select multiple robots who would do battle in an arena until only one was left standing.  The robots did not have direct knowledge of the location or velocity of any of the other robots; they could only use radar pulses to deduce distance, and perhaps use clever programming techniques to deduce velocity.  No physical dexterity was required or even relevant in RobotWar; there was no way for the player to actually take part in the battle.

[[Incumbent]]
CATEGORIES: Political terminology

The incumbent, in politics, is the existing holder of a political office. This term is usually used in reference to elections, in which races can often be defined as being between an incumbent and non-incumbent(s). For example, in the 2012 United States presidential election, Barack Obama was the incumbent, because he had been the president in the previous term while the election sought to determine the president for the current term. A race without an incumbent is referred to as an open seat.

[[Master of Public Administration]]

CATEGORIES: Master's degrees, Public administration

The Master of Public Administration (M.P.Adm., M.P.A. or MPA) is a professional post-graduate degree in Public Administration which is the public sector's offering equivalent to the private sector's Master of Business Administration.
The MPA program is a business degree for the public sector and it prepares individuals to serve as managers in the executive arm of local, state/provincial, and federal/national government, and increasingly in nongovernmental organization (NGO) and nonprofit sectors; it places a focus on the systematic investigation of executive organization and management. Instruction includes the roles, development, and principles of public administration; public policy management and implementation.
Through its history, the MPA degree has become more interdisciplinary by drawing from fields such as economics, sociology, law, anthropology, political science, and regional planning in order to equip MPA graduates with skills and knowledge covering a broad range of topics and disciplines relevant to the public sector. A core curriculum of a typical MPA program usually includes courses on microeconomics, public finance, research methods / statistics, policy process and policy analysis, public financial management, managerial accounting, ethics, public management, leadership, planning & Geographic
Information Systems (GIS), and program evaluation/performance measurement. Depending on their interest, MPA students can focus their studies on a variety of public sector fields such as urban planning, emergency management, transportation, health care (especially public health), economic development, urban management, community development, education, non-profits, information technology, environmental policy, cultural policy, criminal justice, etc.
MPA graduates currently serve in some important positions within the public sector including Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, former CIA Director David Petraeus, President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Former President of Mexico Felipe Calderón, Foreign Minister of Serbia Vuk Jeremić, NYC Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, former Treasurer of Australia Wayne Swan, Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek, former Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard Thad Allen.http://www.uscg.mil/FLAG/cg00.asp
In recent years, there has been a gradual convergence between the MPA and the Master of Public Policy (MPP) degrees. Today, the course offerings of most MPA and MPP programs overlap to some degree, but MPP programs tend to provide more focused training in policy analysis and policy design, while MPA programs usually still provide more focused coursework in program implementation and public management.
Many educational institutions are now offering MPA degrees via online instruction. There are also Executive MPA programs for professionals who have prior work and management experience.
Outside the United States, the MPA degree increasingly includes a substantial element of management education sitting alongside public policy and public administration thereby bringing it closer to the MBA degree. However, some MPA programs in the United States are housed in Business schools (see BYU's Marriott School of Management and LSU's E. J. Ourso College of Business). In other cases, they bring together multidisciplinary approaches and methodologies as to give their students a more comprehensive overview of the current challenges of public administration. (see School of Government, LUISS Guido Carli)

The Master of Public Policy (M.P.P.) one of several public policy degrees, is a master's level professional degree that provides training in policy analysis and program evaluation at public policy schools. The MPP program places a focus on the systematic analysis of issues related to public policy and the decision processes associated with them. This includes training in the role of economic and political factors in public decision-making and policy formulation; microeconomic analysis of policy options and issues; resource allocation and decision modeling; cost/benefit analysis; statistical methods; and various applications to specific public policy topics.National Center for Education Statistics, Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP 2000): 44.0501 (1990 Crosswalk) Public Policy Analysis.

[[Self-perception theory]]

CATEGORIES: Attitude change, Self, Social psychology, Identity

Self-perception theory (SPT) is an account of attitude formation developed by psychologist Daryl Bem.Bem, D. J. (1967). Self-Perception: An Alternative Interpretation of Cognitive Dissonance Phenomena. Psychological Review, 74, 183-200.Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-Perception Theory. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp.1-62). New York: Academic Press. It asserts that people develop their attitudes (when there is no previous attitude-due to a lack of experience, etc-- and the emotional response is ambiguous) by observing their own behavior and concluding what attitudes must have caused it. The theory is counterintuitive in nature, as the conventional wisdom is that attitudes determine behaviors. Furthermore, the theory suggests that people induce attitudes without accessing internal cognition and mood states.Robak, R. W., Ward, A., & Ostolaza, K. (2005). Development of a General Measure of Individuals’ Recognition of Their Self-Perception Processes. Psychology, 7, 337-344. The person interprets their own overt behaviors rationally in the same way they attempt to explain others’ behaviors.

[[Television in New Zealand]]

CATEGORIES: Television in New Zealand

Television in New Zealand was introduced in 1960. Provision was first made for the licensing of private radio and television stations in New Zealand by the Broadcasting Act 1976. 
In New Zealand there are three forms of broadcast digital television. Satellite services provided nationwide by both Freeview and Sky, terrestrial DVB-T service provided in the main centres by Freeview and Igloo, Broadband service delivered over UFB cable and UFB fibre, available in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, Whangarei, Palmerston North and Dunedin from Vodafone.
The first nationwide digital TV service was launched in December 1998 by SKY TV, who had a monopoly on digital satellite TV until the launch of Freeview's nationwide digital satellite service in May 2007. The Freeview digital terrestrial television service launched on 14 April 2008. A pay digital terrestrial service was launched in 2012 by Igloo. This is a joint venture between Sky and TVNZ and provides Freeview UHF aerial channels along with 11 Sky channels. Broadband television currently operates in Wellington, Christchurch, Whangarei, Palmerston North and Dunedin from Vodafone. The Vodafone service includes all SKY TV channels and Freeview channels. High definition programming is available from Freeview and Igloo on terrestrial, on SKY TV through the MY SKY HDi decoder and on Vodafone through UFB Broadband.
The digital television transition in New Zealand is now complete. It began on 30 September 2012, when Hawke's Bay and the West Coast (including parts of Tasman) switched off analogue television transmission. The rest of the South Island switched off analogue television transmission on 28 April 2013, followed by the lower North Island on 29 September 2013. The upper North Island (including the Waikato, Auckland, Bay of Plenty and Northland) was the last region to cease analogue transmissions on 1 December 2013.

[[History of Moscow]]

CATEGORIES: History of Moscow

The city of Moscow gradually grew around the Moscow Kremlin, beginning in the 14th century. It was the capital of Great Russia, also known as the Grand Duchy of Moscow (or Muscovy), from 1340 to 1547 and then the Tsardom of Russia until 1712 (when the capital was moved to Saint Petersburg). It was the capital of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918, which then became the Soviet Union (1922 to 1991), and since 1991 has served as capital of the Russian Federation.
Situated on either bank of the eponymous Moskva River, the city during the 16th to 17th centuries grew up in five concentric divisions, formerly separated from one another by walls: the Kremlin ("fortress"), Kitaigorod ("walled town", but interpreted as "Chinatown" by folk etymology), Bielygorod ("white town"), Zemlianoigorod ("earthworks town"), and Miestchanskygorod ("bourgeois town") outside the city walls.
After the fire of 1812, the city ramparts were replaced with the Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring roads, replacing the walls around Bielygorod and Zemlianoigorod, respectively. The city's population grew from 250,000 to over a million in the 19th century, and from one to ten million in the 20th century, putting it among the top twenty of the world's most populous cities today.

[[Duncan Kyle]]

CATEGORIES: 1930 births, British thriller writers, 2001 deaths

John Franklin Broxholme (born 11 June 1930 Bradford, died 24 June 2000 Bury St EdmundsObituary in Turun Sanomat on 18 July 2000) is an English thriller writer who published fifteen novels in a little over twenty years (1971–1993) using the pen name of Duncan Kyle. 
Reminiscent of the work of Desmond Bagley, Kyle's books typically involve a tough, resourceful individual who unexpectedly becomes involved in danger and intrigue in an exotic setting.  A Cage of Ice, for example, involves a London physician who accompanies a hand-picked team of adventurers on a snowmobile journey across the Arctic to rescue a defecting Soviet scientist.  Green River High follows another group of adventurers into the jungles of Borneo in search of a plane that crashed there during World War II. Kyle's novels are, like those of Bagley and Alistair MacLean, stronger on plot and setting than on characterization.  They are invariably well-crafted, however, and two--The King's Commissar and The Dancing Men--are classics of the historical fiction and historical detective story genres, respectively.

In economics, a time-based currency is an alternative currency where the unit of exchange is the person-hour.
Some time-based currencies value everyone’s contributions equally: one hour equals one service credit. In these systems, one person volunteers to work for an hour for another person; thus, they are credited with one hour, which they can redeem for an hour of service from another volunteer. Critics charge that this would lead to fewer doctors or dentists. Other systems, such as Ithaca Hours, let doctors and dentists charge more hours per hour.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

[[Covenanted Baptist Church of Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Baptist denominations in North America

The Covenanted Baptist Church of Canada - a small body of Predestinarian Baptists in Canada with Scottish roots.
In 1818 Dugald Campbell, of North Knapdale, Scotland emigrated to Canada and settled in Aldborough, Elgin County, Ontario. Campbell was a deacon in Scotland, but upon his arrival soon began preaching.
In 1820, Elder Dugald Campbell and his followers, believing the Regular Baptists of the area had departed from gospel faith and order, withdrew from them and constituted a church in Aldborough, now known as the Particular Covenanted Baptist Church in Canada. Still a small group, they had grown to five churches in the 1850s - Aldborough, Dunwich, Ekfird, Lobo, and Orford. The Covenanted Baptist Church did not fellowship with any other churches in North America, until an elder, Thomas McColl, received some issues of the Signs of the Times, a Primitive Baptist periodical published by Gilbert Beebe of New York. In 1857 and 1858, McColl invited Primitive Baptists to visit and preach among their churches. The two groups saw they were established on the same faith and order, and began a relationship of fellowship one with another, which continued to the 20th century. The Covenanted Baptists held the doctrine of absolute predestination, and, after Primitive Baptists in the United States suffered division, remained in correspondence with the Absolute Predestinarian Primitive Baptists.

Their use of heavily distorted keyboards and synthesizers made them, along with The Screamers, one of the original innovators of what is today called "Synthpunk", although they could equally be considered an early industrial group. The group was confrontational and experimental.
Phranc's androgynous appearance was the embodiment of the group's name, garnered the band much press in zines such as Slash and, later,  proving inspirational to founders of the Queercore movement. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] Despite their somewhat high profile, the groups' habit of provoking the audience, obscene material and harsh erotics guaranteed they would never gain commercial acceptance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] At their first show in 1979, a benefit for the Women's Video Center, Phranc called the audience "pussies" and "dykes" when the band was requested to stop playing.

The culture of the Philippines reflects the country's complex history. It is a Malayo-Polynesian culture.
The Philippines was first settled by Melanesians; today, although few in numbers, they preserve a very traditional way of life and culture.  After them, the Austronesians or more specifically, Malayo-Polynesians, arrived on the islands. Today the Austronesian culture is very evident in the ethnicity, language, food, dance and almost every aspect of the culture. These Austronesians engaged in trading with China, India, Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, the Middle East, Borneo, and other places. As a result, those cultures have also left a mark on Filipino culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thephilippines.ph/philippine-culture/going-banana/|title=Going Banana|publisher=ThePhilippines.ph[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html|title=The Cultural Influences of India, China, Arabia, and Japan|publisher=Philippine Almanac[/tpl]
The Spanish colonized the islands and after more than three centuries of colonization Hispanic influence has heavily impacted the culture. The Philippines being governed from both Mexico and Spain, had received a fair bit of Hispanic influence. Mexican and Spanish influence can be seen in dance and religion as well as many other aspects of the culture. After being colonized by Spain, the Philippines became a U.S. territory for about 40 years. Influence from the United States is seen in the wide use of the English language, and the modern pop culture.

CATEGORIES: Boston (band) albums, 1978 albums, Albums produced by Tom Scholz, Epic Records albums, Legacy Recordings albums

Don't Look Back is the second studio album by American rock band Boston, released in 1978. The title track is one of the band's biggest hits, reaching #4 in 1978 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The album sold over four million copies in the first month of its release, and has been certified 7x platinum by the RIAA in the US.[tpl]cite certification |region=United States |artist=Boston |title=Don't Look Back |type=album |accessdate=[tpl]date|2010-01-10|mdy[/tpl][/tpl]
This album also marked the beginning of the band's legal fight with its record label Epic Records. Tom Scholz has been on record stating that executives at Epic pushed him and the band into releasing the album before they felt it was ready. He also said that the album "was ridiculously short. It needed another song." Their next album, Third Stage, was not released for another eight years, by which time the band and record label had parted ways and were fighting a courtroom battle that Boston ultimately won.

For most of the series, the team includes leader King Mob; Lord Fanny, a Brazilian  shaman; Boy, a former member of the NYPD; Ragged Robin, a telepath with a mysterious past; and Jack Frost, a young hooligan from Liverpool who may be the next Buddha. Their enemies are the Archons of Outer Church, interdimensional alien gods who have already enslaved most of the human race without their knowledge.

[[PTAT-1]]

CATEGORIES: Transatlantic communications cables, Infrastructure completed in 1989, United Kingdom–United States relations, Ireland–United Kingdom relations, Ireland–United States relations

PTAT-1 was the first privately financed transatlantic fiber optic cable, which was completed in 1989, at a cost of 400 million US dollars.
It was maintained by C&W and Sprint/PSI and connected Manasquan, New Jersey, USA with Devonshire, Bermuda and Ballinspittle, Ireland, terminating at Brean, England, UK for a distance of 7,552 kilometres.
The significance of PTAT-1 is that it broke the international telecommunication monopoly held by AT&T Corporation and British Telecom for communications between the US and UK.  When PTAT-1 filed for its Cable Landing License under the 1934 Cable Landing Act the idea of competitive international telecommunications was widely condemned[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] by the international telecommunication establishment, i.e. the PTTs.  By the time PTAT-1 was placed into service in 1989 competition was widely accepted[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl].
PTAT-1 was built by a joint venture of a small private US company, Private TransAtlantic Telecommunication System (founded as TelOptik in 1984) and Cable & Wireless plc of the UK.  The submarine system and line terminal equipment was provided by STC and alarm and control system management by ICL. The US shore end was built by Lightwave Spectrum.  
The UK to US section of the cable was shut down just after 2.00 a.m. on 8 February 2004 as it was no longer considered financially viable by Cable & Wireless. Competitors to the cable had dropped their prices drastically after they re-emerged from Chapter 11 with little or no debts to service, something C&W was unable to compete with.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
This cable provided intelligent repeaters that counted bit errors which were reported in response to interrogation from a base station. It contained three fibre pairs which were used to provide two active channels. Each repeater included a base station-controlled cross-over data switch to swap traffic through a choice of two fibre pairs, the switch connections in successive repeaters enabled any desired connection to be made and provide a diversity path when required.

[[Third Stage]]

CATEGORIES: 1986 albums, Boston (band) albums, Albums produced by Tom Scholz, MCA Records albums

Third Stage is the third album by American hard rock band Boston released September 23, 1986 on MCA Records. It was recorded at Tom Scholz's Hideaway Studio over a six-year period "between floods and power failures".[tpl]cite AV media notes |title=Third Stage |others=Boston |year=1986 |chapter= |url= |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |page= |pages= |type=CD liner |publisher=MCA Records |id= |location= |ref=[/tpl]
After winning a legal battle with Epic Records, Scholz switched his band's recording label to MCA.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/arts/the-pop-life-new-boston-hit-a-throwback-to-70-s.html |last=Pareles |first=Jon |title=The Pop Life; New Boston Hit a Throwback to 70's |date=1986-11-05 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company[/tpl] The album's first track, "Amanda", was actually written in 1980 (when Boston began work on the album) and became the band's only #1 single. It reached and stayed at #1 for two weeks in November 1986. It was followed by the second Top 10 single from the album, "We're Ready", which reached #9 in 1987.  The songs "Cool the Engines" and "Can'tcha Say / Still in Love" also got substantial airplay, with the "Can'tcha Say (You Believe In Me) / Still In Love" peaking at #20 in 1987 on the Billboard Hot 100. It remains Boston's last Top 40 hit to date.
Third Stage went to #1 on the Billboard 200, where it stayed for four weeks. It was the first CD-formatted album to be certified gold (500,000 copies) by the RIAA. It was also certified gold in the LP format, making it what is believed to be the first album certified in both of these formats. In all, the album was certified 4x platinum.
The album was a first in many respects: the first Boston LP to feature electronic drum samples, the first to feature songs not written by either Scholz or Brad Delp, the first Boston LP without original members Barry Goudreau, Sib Hashian and Fran Sheehan (though Hashian and Sheehan were included in the early recording sessions and Sheehan received a writing credit), and the first (and only) Boston LP without the iconic guitar UFO dominating the cover art, though a small image of it is present. The spaceship on its cover art later appears on the disc of their next album, Walk On. Original drummer Jim Masdea (who played on the demos that made a bulk of the first Boston album) plays drums on most of the album. This LP was also the first Boston recording to use the Scholz-invented Rockman guitar processor. No orchestral sounds or synthesizers were used on the album.

Katmai National Park and Preserve is a United States National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska, notable for the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and for its brown bears. The park and preserve covers [tpl]convert|4,093,077|acres|sqmi km2|2[/tpl], being roughly the size of Wales. Most of this is a designated wilderness area in the national park where all sport hunting is banned, including over [tpl]convert|3922000|acres[/tpl] of land. The park is named after Mount Katmai, its centerpiece stratovolcano. The park is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about [tpl]convert|290|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Anchorage. The area was first designated a national monument in 1918 to protect the area around the major 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta, which formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a [tpl]convert|40|sqmi|km2|adj=on[/tpl], [tpl]convert|100|to|700|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep[/tpl] pyroclastic flow. The park includes as many as 18 individual volcanoes, seven of which have been active since 1900.
Following its designation, the monument was left undeveloped and largely unvisited until the 1950s. Initially designated because of its violent volcanic history, the monument and surrounding lands became appreciated for their abundance of sockeye salmon, the grizzly bears that fed upon them, and a wide variety of other Alaskan wildlife and marine life.  After a series of boundary expansions, the present national park and preserve were established in 1980 under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980.

Christianity teaches that Jesus is the Messiah (Christ) and the Son of God Incarnate. Christians believe that through his death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life.Oxford Companion to the Bible p.649 These teachings emphasize that as the willing Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury by Dániel Deme 2004 ISBN 0-7546-3779-4 pages 199-200The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 79 Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.
In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is one of God's highest-ranked and most-beloved prophets. Islam considers Jesus to be neither the incarnation nor the Son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry (shirk).
The Bahá'í Faith consider Jesus to be a manifestation of God, who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world. Bahá'ís reject the idea that divinity was contained with a single human body.
Apart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Mainstream Jewish scholars argue that Jesus neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.
Other world religions such as Buddhism have no particular view on Jesus, and have but a minor intersection with Christianity. For non-religious perspectives on Jesus, see historical Jesus.

[[Scream queen]]

CATEGORIES: Film and video terminology, Horror films

A scream queen is an actress who has become associated with horror films, either through an appearance in a notable entry in the genre as a frequent victim or through constant appearances as the female protagonist. Jamie Lee Curtis is noted as a seminal example for her performance in the popular slasher films of the  Halloween franchise.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/dvd/features/fridaythe13th/1.asp |title=The Top 11 Scream Queens - Jamie Lee Curtis |publisher=UGO |date= |accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl]

[[Liebig's law of the minimum]]

CATEGORIES: Agronomy, Ecological theories, Systems ecology

Liebig's law of the minimum, often simply called Liebig's law or the law of the minimum, is a principle developed in agricultural science by Carl Sprengel (1828) and later popularized by Justus von Liebig. It states that growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource (limiting factor).

Photometric-standard stars are a series of stars that have had their light output in various passbands of photometric system, measured very carefully.  Other objects can be observed using CCD cameras or photoelectric photometers connected to a telescope, and the flux, or amount of light received, can be compared to a photometric-standard star to determine the exact brightness, or stellar magnitude, of the object.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

A learned society (also known as a scholarly society or academic association) is an organization that exists to promote an academic discipline or profession, or a group of related disciplines or professions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esac.ca/about/what-is-a-learned-society/|title=The Environmental Studies Association of Canada - What is a Learned Society?|accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl] Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some qualification, or may be an honor conferred by election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/science-uk-organisations-learned-societies.htm|title=Learned societies & academies|accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl] This is the case with the oldest learned societies, such as the Polish Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana (founded 1488), the Italian Accademia dei Lincei (founded 1603), the Académie Française (founded 1635), the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (founded 1652) or the Royal Society of London (founded 1660).
Most learned societies are non-profit organizations. Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership.
Learned societies are of key importance in the sociology of science, and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.
Societies can be very general in nature, such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, specific to a given discipline, such as the Modern Language Association, or specific to a given area of study, such as the Royal Entomological Society.
Most are either specific to a particular country (though they generally include some members from other countries as well), often with local branches, or are international, such as the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) or the Regional Studies Association, in which case they often have national branches. But many are local, such as the Massachusetts Medical Society, the publishers of the internationally known New England Journal of Medicine.
Some learned societies (such as the Royal Society of New Zealand) have been rechartered by legislation to form quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations.

[[Jesus in Christianity]]
CATEGORIES: Christology, Perspectives on Jesus

Christian views of Jesus are based on the teachings and beliefs outlined in the Canonical gospels, New Testament letters, and the Christian creeds. These outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life. The second sentence in the ICET version of the Nicene Creed states: "We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God...". In the New Testament Jesus indicates that he is the Son of God by calling God his heavenly father.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Mt.|6:9[/tpl] One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 ISBN 3-11-018151-7 pages 240-241
Christians consider Jesus the Christ and believe that through his death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life.Oxford Companion to the Bible p.649 These teachings emphasize that as the willing Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer on the cross at Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of the Eternal Father, as an "agent and servant of God".The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury by Dániel Deme 2004 ISBN 0-7546-3779-4 pages 199-200The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 79 The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam's disobedience.Systematic Theology, Volume 2 by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303
Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and divine—the Son of God. While there has been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, Trinitarian Christians believe that Jesus is the Logos, God incarnate, God the Son, and "true God and true man"—both fully divine and fully human. Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again.

[[Historicity of Jesus]]

CATEGORIES: Perspectives on Jesus, Jesus and history, Historicity of religious figures, Christianity-related controversies, Christianity and the Greco-Roman world

The historicity of Jesus concerns the analysis of historical evidence to determine whether Jesus of Nazareth existed as a historical figure, and whether any of the major milestones in his life as portrayed in the gospels can be confirmed as historical events.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Historicity is the study of the historical actuality of persons and events, meaning the quality of being part of history as opposed to being a historical myth or legend, or of being part of prehistory. Questions of historicity arise where accounts of events are believed by some to be true, but cannot be verified, either due to the absence of historical records of sufficient reliability or where historical accounts incorporate folklore, theological views or literature as fact.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The historicity of Jesus is distinct from the related study of the Historical Jesus, which refers to scholarly reconstructions of the life of Jesus, based on historical methods including critical analysis of gospel texts as the primary source for his biography, along with consideration of the historical and cultural context in which he lived.Jesus Remembered Volume 1, by James D.

Since the 18th century a number of quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, and historical critical methods for studying the historicity of Jesus have been developed. Various Christian and non-Christian sources are used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus, e.g. Jewish sources such as Josephus, and Roman sources such as Tacitus. These sources are compared and contrasted to Christian sources such as the Pauline Letters and the Synoptic Gospels. These sources are usually independent of each other (e.g. Jewish sources do not draw upon Roman sources), and similarities and differences between them are used in the authentication process.The Cambridge Companion to Jesus by Markus N.

[[Relics associated with Jesus]]

CATEGORIES: Mythological objects, Relics associated with Jesus

A number of relics associated with Jesus have been claimed and displayed throughout the history of Christianity. Some people believe in the authenticity of some relics; others doubt the authenticity of various items. For instance, the sixteenth-century Catholic theologian Erasmus wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics, and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the cross used in the Crucifixion of Christ.[tpl]harvnb|Dillenberger|1999|p=5[/tpl] Similarly, while experts debate whether Christ was crucified with three or with four nails, at least thirty Holy Nails continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle =Holy Nails|title=Holy Nails|first= Herbert|last=Thurston[/tpl]
Some relics, such as purported remnants of the Crown of Thorns, receive only a modest number of pilgrims, while others, such as the Shroud of Turin (which is associated with an approved Catholic devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus), receive millions of pilgrims, which in recent years have included Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI.[tpl]citation|last=Pope John Paul II|authorlink=Pope John Paul II|title=Pope John Paul II's address in Turin Cathedral|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_24051998_sindone_en.html|publisher=Holy See|date=1998-05-24[/tpl]

The experimental analysis of behavior (EAB) is the name given to the school of psychology founded  J.B. Watson.Skinner, B.F.: The Evolution of Behavior (1984) EAB paved the way of I.

A central principle was the inductive, data-drivenChiesa, Mecca: Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science (2005) examination of functional relations, as opposed to the kinds of hypothetico-deductive learning theorySkinner, B.F.: Are Theories of Learning Necessary? (1951) that had grown up in the comparative psychology of the 1920–1950 period. Skinner's approach was characterized by empirical observation of measurable behavior which could be predicted and controlled. It owed its early success to the effectiveness of Skinner's procedures of operant conditioning, both in the laboratory and in behavior therapy—what is now called applied behavior analysis.

CATEGORIES: Gestures of respect, Interpersonal relationships, Virtue, Positive psychology, Cultural conventions, Human behavior, Anti-social behaviour

Respect is a positive feeling of esteem or deference for a person or other entity (such as a nation or a religion), and also specific actions and conduct representative of that esteem. Respect can be a specific feeling of regard for the actual qualities of the one respected (e.g., "I have great respect for her judgment"). It can also be conduct in accord with a specific ethic of respect. 
Rude conduct is usually considered to indicate a lack of respect, disrespect, whereas actions that honor somebody or something indicate respect. 
Specific ethics of respect are of fundamental importance to various cultures. Respect for tradition and legitimate authority is identified by Jonathan Haidt, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, as one of five fundamental moral values shared to a greater or lesser degree by different societies and individuals.
Respect can be both given and/or received. Depending on an individual's cultural reference frame, respect can be something that is earned. Respect is often thought of as earned or built over time. Often, continued caring interactions are required to maintain or increase feelings of respect among individuals. Chivalry, by some definitions, contains the outward display of respect.
Respect should not be confused with tolerance.
The antonym and opposite of respect is disrespect.

[[Lesser Crested Tern]]

CATEGORIES: Thalasseus, Birds of Europe, Birds of Turkey, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of Western Australia, Birds of Western Sahara

The Lesser Crested Tern (Thalasseus bengalensis, syn. Sterna bengalensis - see Bridge et al., 2005) is a seabird of the tern family Sternidae. It breeds in subtropical coastal parts of the world mainly from the Red Sea across the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific, and Australia, with a significant population on the southern coast of the Mediterranean on two islands off the Libyan coast. Accidental breeding has also been reported in Italy and France. The Australian birds are probably sedentary, but other populations are migratory, wintering south to South Africa.
This bird has a number of geographical subspecies, differing mainly in size and minor plumage details:
The Mediterranean race is a rare vagrant to Europe, and has bred in pure or mixed pairs (with Sandwich Tern) in Italy, Spain and England.
This species breeds in dense colonies on coasts and islands. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to two (rarely three) eggs. Nesting behaviour is very similar to that of Sandwich Terns, with predator avoidance by nesting in very dense colonies, and also (in race emigrata at least) by nesting in the late summer when predatory Yellow-legged Gulls have finished breeding and departed from the nesting area.
Like all Thalasseus terns, Lesser Crested Tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, usually from saline environments. It usually dives directly, and not from the "stepped-hover" favoured by Arctic Tern.  The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.
This is a medium-large tern, very similar in size and general appearance to its three very close relatives Sandwich Tern, Elegant Tern and Chinese Crested Tern. The summer adult has a black cap, black legs and a long sharp orange bill. The upperwings, rump and central tail feathers are grey and the underparts white. The primary flight feathers darken during the summer. In winter, the forehead becomes white. The call is a loud grating noise like Sandwich Tern.
The grey rump is a useful flight identification feature distinguishing it from the related species. The Elegant Tern also differs in a slightly longer, slenderer bill, while Chinese Crested Tern differs in a black tip to the bill and Sandwich Tern a black bill with a yellow tip.
Juvenile Lesser Crested Terns resemble same-age Sandwich Terns, but with a yellow-orange bill, and paler overall, with only faint dark crescents on the mantle feathers.
There are two other orange-billed terns within the range of this species, Royal Tern and Greater Crested Tern. Both are much larger and stouter-billed; Royal also has a white rump and tail, while Crested (which shares the grey rump) is darker overall above and has a yellower bill. See also Orange-billed tern.
T. bengalensis is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies, and one of 10 marine bird species listed in Mediterranean marine birds Action Plan http://www.rac-spa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=97&Itemid=154.

The Iron Guard ([tpl]lang-ro|Garda de fier[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ro|ˈɡarda de ˈfjer|pron[/tpl]) is the name most commonly given to a far-right movement and political party in Romania in the period from 1927 into the early part of World War II. The Iron Guard was ultra-nationalist, fascist, anti-communist, and promoted the Orthodox Christian faith. It is also considered an antisemitic organization, an ideology even going so far as to demand the introduction of "state anti-semitism".[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=U6KVOsjpP0MC&pg=PA230&dq=iron+guard+antisemitic&hl=de&ei=q4FSTerbL4ak8QPlq6GjCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The World Reacts to the Holocaust - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.de |date= |accessdate=2013-05-16[/tpl]
When Ion Antonescu came to power in September 1940 he brought the Iron Guard into the government.  The Guard launched a murderous attack on Jews. In January 1941, however, Antonescu used the army to suppress a revolt of the Iron Guard. He destroyed the organization, as its  commander Horia Sima and some other leaders escaped to Germany.

They are deciduous flowering shrubs or small trees, reaching 10-15 m tall.
The leaf arrangement is opposite and pinnate. The inflorescences are paniculate, terminal or axillary. The flowers have five sepals and petals; staminate flowers have eight stamens, and bisexual flowers have a two-celled ovary. The fruit is a rounded samara containing two compressed nutlets, flat, encircled by a broad wing which turns from light green to red with ripening.
There are only two living species, Dipteronia sinensis and Dipteronia dyeriana; both are endemic to mainland China. Dipteronia dyeriana is listed by the IUCN as being a "Red List" threatened species. Dipteronia browni is an extinct species from the early Eocene Klondike Mountain Formation of Washington, and is also known from early Eocene sites in British Columbia Canada such as Driftwood Canyon Provincial Park and the McAbee Fossil Beds.
The name Dipteronia stems from the Greek "di-" (two, both) & "pteron" (wings), from the winged fruits with wings on both sides of the seed.

eLISA will be the first dedicated space-based gravitational wave detector. It will measure gravitational waves directly by using laser interferometry. The LISA concept has a constellation three spacecraft, arranged in an equilateral triangle with million kilometre arms (5 million km for classic LISA, 1 million km for eLISA) flying along an Earth-like heliocentric orbit. The distance between the satellites is monitored to detect a passing gravitational wave.
A LISA-like mission is designed to directly observe gravitational waves, which are distortions of space-time travelling at the speed of light. Passing gravitational waves alternately squeeze and stretch objects by a tiny amount. Gravitational waves are caused by energetic events in the universe and, unlike any other radiation, can pass unhindered by intervening mass. Launching eLISA will add a new sense to scientists' perception of the universe and enable them to listen to a world that is invisible with light.[tpl]Cite web | title = eLISA: Science Context 2028 | publisher = eLISA Consortium | url = https://www.elisascience.org/articles/science-context-2028 |accessdate = 15 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite web | title = Gravitational-Wave Detetectors Get Ready to Hunt for the Big Bang | publisher = Scientific American | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gravitational-wave-detectors-get-ready-to-hunt-for-the-big-bang |date = 17 September 2013[/tpl]

In mathematics, the Gelfand representation in functional analysis (named after I. M. Gelfand) has two related meanings:
In the former case, one may regard the Gelfand representation as a far-reaching generalization of the Fourier transform of an integrable function. In the latter case, the Gelfand-Naimark representation theorem is one avenue in the development of spectral theory for normal operators, and generalizes the notion of diagonalizing a normal matrix.

[[Ross rifle]]

CATEGORIES: Bolt-action rifles, Rifles of Canada, Scottish inventions, World War I Canadian infantry weapons, World War II military equipment of Canada, 1903 introductions

The Ross rifle was a straight-pull bolt action .303 inch-calibre rifle produced in Canada from 1903 until 1918.Phillips, J. et al The Ross Rifle Story (The Casket Printing & Publishing Co., 2005).
The Ross Mk.II (or "model 1905") rifle was highly successful in target shooting before WWI, but the close chamber tolerances, lack of primary extraction and overall length made the Mk.III (or "1910") Ross rifle unsuitable for the conditions of trench warfare and the often poor quality ammunition issued.Duguid, Col. A.F. ''A Question of Confidence; The Ross Rifle in the Trenches" (Service Publications, 1999).
By 1916, the rifle had been withdrawn from front line service, but continued to be used by many snipers of the Canadian Expeditionary Force until the end of the war due to its exceptional accuracy.Without Warning: Canadian Sniper Equipment (Service Publications, 2005).
The Ross Rifle Co. made sporting rifles from early in its production, most notably chambered in .280 Ross, introduced in 1907.  This cartridge is recorded as the first to achieve over 3000 feet per second velocity, and the cartridge acquired a very considerable international reputation among target shooters and hunters.

In mathematics, a functional equation is any equation that specifies a function in implicit form.
Often, the equation relates the value of a function (or functions) at some point with its values at other points. For instance, properties of functions can be determined by considering the types of functional equations they satisfy. The term functional equation usually refers to equations that cannot be simply reduced to algebraic equations.

[[Montafon]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Vorarlberg, Valleys of Austria

Montafon is a valley in Austria that extends from the city of Bludenz to the Silvretta mountain range. It is also known in the local dialect as Muntafu. 
The Stand Montafon is the association of the ten valley villages. The main town is Schruns. Travelling from Bludenz, you enter state road B188 which takes you by the old cement plant of Lorüns and through the town of Lorüns. After driving through the magic Alma woods and past the Tränabächle (brook of tears) the valley opens to its main splendor at St. Anton (in the local dialect: "Santatöni") on the left, and Vens and Vandans on the right. St. Anton, which is not to be confused with its larger and more famous sister, St. Anton am Arlberg, is the hometown of the Stemer clan and the Battlogg clan. On you travel by Rodund, the main center-valley electrohydric plant of the Vorarlberger Illwerke, through Gantschier and Kaltenbrunnen and on to Schruns and Tschagguns (in the local dialect: "Schru und Tschaggu"). The mountain town of Bartholomäberg spreads its wings above Schruns, with its outliers Jetzmunt and Lutt watching over St. Anton and its southeastern outliers Kristberg and Innerberg watching over the Silbertal valley. The Silbertal stretches from Schruns to the outpost of the Fellamendli in a south-easterly direction pointing towards the Arlberg mountain range. The hamlet of Latschau, with its hydroelectric power station and the main base of the Golm ski resort, watches over Tschagguns opposite from Bartholomäberg. 
From Schruns and Tschagguns onward you cross the Montafon midpoint that divides the outer valley ("Außerfratte") from the inner valley ("Innerfratte"). As you arrive in St. Gallenkirch, you will be able to branch off at Galgenul towards Gargellen, another magically rugged branch valley that terminates at the ski resort of Gargellen. Continuing in the main Montafon valley, you will pass through Gortipohl and on to Gaschurn (in the local dialect: "Gaschorra") and then Partenen, where the road starts to snake up to the Silvretta mountain pass.  
A number of celebrities, including Al Dassler, have stayed in the valley. Some of the older folks still talk about the long nights in Schruns playing cards and drinking with Ernest Hemingway and John dos Passos. The Snows of the Kilimanjaro and several other novels and short stories were written in, or they contain material from, the Montafon and the Silvretta glaciers. Later, the famous German novelist and poet Erich Kästner repeatedly visited the valley, as did the former German chancellor Helmut Kohl. The noted opera singer Elisabeth Schwarzkopf spent her last years in Schruns, where she died on August 2, 2006.
The Montafon is famous for skiing, hiking, and mountain biking. There are two 9-hole golf courses, one in Tschagguns and one in Partenen.

[[Quantum foam]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum gravity, Quantum field theory, Wormhole theory, Foams

Quantum foam (also referred to as space-time foam) is a concept in quantum mechanics devised by John Wheeler in 1955. The foam is supposed to be conceptualized as the foundation of the fabric of the universe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ldolphin.org/qfoam.html|title=Quantum foam|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=29 June 2008[/tpl]
Additionally, quantum foam can be used as a qualitative description of subatomic space-time turbulence at extremely small distances (on the order of the Planck length). At such small scales of time and space, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows energy to briefly decay into particles and antiparticles and then annihilate without violating physical conservation laws. As the scale of time and space being discussed shrinks, the energy of the virtual particles increases. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, energy curves space-time. This suggests that—at sufficiently small scales—the energy of these fluctuations would be large enough to cause significant departures from the smooth space-time seen at larger scales, giving space-time a "foamy" character.
With an incomplete theory of quantum gravity, it is impossible to be certain what space-time would look like at these small scales, because existing theories of gravity do not give accurate predictions in that regime. Therefore, any of the developing theories of quantum gravity may improve our understanding of quantum foam as they are tested. However, observations of radiation from nearby quasars by Floyd Stecker of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have placed strong experimental limits on the possible violations of Einstein's special theory of relativity implied by the existence of quantum foam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/1212einstein.html|title=Einstein makes extra dimensions toe the line|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl] Thus experimental evidence so far has given a range of values in which scientists can test for quantum foam.

[[Genetic variation]]
CATEGORIES: Population genetics

Genetic variation, variation in alleles of genes, occurs both within and among populations. Genetic variation is important because it provides the genetic material for natural selection. Genetic variation is brought about by mutation, which is a permanent change in the chemical structure of a gene. Polyploidy is an example of chromosomal mutation. Polyploidy is a condition wherein organisms have three or more sets of genetic variation (3n or more). The mutation is started off by a parent, as the parent mates the offspring now has a chance to receive that mutation trait also. Now when that mutated offspring is ready to mate they now have the chance of passing on that trait to their offspring. This process begins the first generation of mutated offspring.

The Objectivist poets were a loose-knit group of second-generation Modernists who emerged in the 1930s. They were mainly American and were influenced by, amongst others, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams. The basic tenets of Objectivist poetics as defined by Louis Zukofsky were to treat the poem as an object, and to emphasise sincerity, intelligence, and the poet's ability to look clearly at the world. Note that while the name is similar to Ayn Rand's school of philosophy, the two movements are not affiliated, and are, in fact, radically different.[tpl]cite book|last=Axelrod|first=Steven Gould, Camille Roman and Thomas Travisano|title=The New Anthology of American Poetry: Vol. III: Postmodernisms 1950-Present|year=2012|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=Piscataway NJ|isbn=978-0813551562|pages=10[/tpl]
The core group consisted of the Americans Zukofsky, Williams, Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen and Carl Rakosi, and the British poet Basil Bunting. Later, another American poet, Lorine Niedecker, became associated with the group. A number of other poets were included in early publications under the Objectivist rubric without actually sharing the attitudes and approaches to poetry of this core group. Although these poets generally suffered critical neglect, especially in their early careers, and a number of them abandoned the practice of writing and/or publishing poetry for a time, they were to prove highly influential for later generations of writers working in the tradition of modernist poetry in English.

[[Feet forwards motorcycle]]

CATEGORIES: Motorcycle classifications, Feet forwards motorcycles

A Feet First (FF) Motorcycle is a class of motorcycle design that seeks to look at the two-wheeled concept afresh, and create a new form of practical personal transport. The name "feet first" (also referred to as "feet forward") was first used by Royce CreaseyHi-tech, R. Creasey, Bike Magazine October 1979 and refers to the rider's seating position, with feet ahead in a position (like a car), rather than below and astride, as with conventional bikes.  As there are other types of motorcycle (e.g. choppers) that have a 'feet forward' position, an alternative term sometimes used is Advanced Single Track Vehicle.
To be classed as an FF the originators of the 'modern' FF - Malcolm Newell and Royce Creasey - came up with the definition that:
In practice this is not strictly adhered to, and this has developed into:
and that:
The Feet Forward motorcycle differs significantly from the conventional scooter (e.g. the Piaggio Vespa), and the maxi scooter (e.g. the Suzuki Burgman), in that the expectation of the design is that it should outmatch a conventional motorcycle in terms of handling and performance, as well as in rider comfort.

[[Lagniappe]]
CATEGORIES: Quechua words and phrases, Cultural conventions

A lagniappe ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|n|j|æ|p[/tpl] [tpl]respell|LAN|yap[/tpl]) is a small gift given to a customer by a merchant at the time of a purchase (such as a 13th doughnut when buying a dozen), or more broadly, "something given or obtained gratuitously or by way of good measure."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=lagniappe | publisher=Merriam-Webster | title=Definition of lagniappe | accessdate=2007-10-29[/tpl]
The word entered English from the Louisiana French adapting a Quechua word brought in to New Orleans by the Spanish creoles. It derived from the South American Spanish phrase la yapa (referring to a free extra item, usually a very cheap one). The term has been traced back to the Quechua word yapay ('to increase; to add'). In Andean markets it is still customary to ask for a yapa (translates as "a little extra") when making a purchase. The seller usually responds by throwing in a little extra.  Although this is an old custom, it is still widely practiced today in Louisiana.  Street vendors, especially vegetable vendors, are expected to throw in a few green chillies or a small bunch of cilantro with a purchase.
The word is chiefly used in the Gulf Coast of the United States, but the concept is practiced in many places, such as Southeast Asia, North Africa, rural France, Australia and Holland.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]

[[Vedic Sanskrit]]
CATEGORIES: Vedic period, Sanskrit, Linguistic history of India

Vedic Sanskrit is an Old Indo-Aryan language. It is the spoken ancestor of liturgical Sanskrit, and an early descendant of Proto-Indo-Iranian. It is closely related to Avestan, the oldest preserved Iranian language. Vedic Sanskrit is the oldest attested language of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family.
Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, texts compiled over the period of early-to-mid 2nd to mid 1st millennium BC. It was orally preserved as a part of the Śrauta tradition of Vedic chanting, predating the advent of alphabetic writing in India by several centuries. For lack of both epigraphic evidence and an unbroken manuscript tradition, Vedic Sanskrit can be considered a reconstructed language. Especially the oldest stage of the language, Rigvedic Sanskrit, the language of the hymns of the Rigveda, is preserved only in a redacted form several centuries younger than the texts' composition.  Recovering its original form is a matter of linguistic reconstruction.Restoring historical language of the vedas from attested vedic
From about the 4th century BC, in the classical period of Iron Age Ancient India, Vedic Sanskrit gave way to Classical Sanskrit as defined by the grammar of [tpl]IAST|Pāṇini[/tpl].

[[Single-track vehicle]]
CATEGORIES: Vehicles by type

A single-track vehicle is a vehicle that leaves a single ground track as it moves forward. Single-track vehicles usually have little or no lateral stability when stationary but develop it when moving forward or controlled. In the case of wheeled vehicles, the track of the front and rear wheel usually follow slightly different paths when turning or when out of alignment. 
Single-track vehicles have unique dynamics that, in the case of wheeled vehicles, are discussed at length in bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, that usually require leaning into a turn, and that usually include countersteering. Single-track vehicles can roll on wheels, slide, float, or hydroplane.

[[PSOLA]]
CATEGORIES: Speech synthesis

PSOLA  (Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add) is a digital signal processing technique used for speech processing and more specifically speech synthesis. It can be used to modify the pitch and duration of a speech signal.
PSOLA works by dividing the speech waveform in small overlapping segments. To change the pitch of the signal, the segments are moved further apart (to decrease the pitch) or closer together (to increase the pitch). To change the duration of the signal, the segments are then repeated multiple times (to increase the duration) or some are eliminated (to decrease the duration). The segments are then combined using the overlap add technique.
PSOLA can be used to change the prosody of a speech signal.

The Honda Accord [tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɔr|d[/tpl] is a series of automobiles manufactured by Honda since 1976, best known for its four-door sedan variant, which has been one of the best-selling cars in the United States since 1989. The Accord nameplate has been applied to a variety of vehicles worldwide, including coupes, wagons, hatchbacks and a crossover.
In 1982, the Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the United States when production commenced in Marysville, Ohio at Honda's Marysville Auto Plant. The Accord has achieved considerable success, especially in the United States, where it was the best-selling Japanese car for fifteen years (1982–97), topping its class in sales in 1991 and 2001, with around ten million vehicles sold.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0710_2008_honda_accord_vs_2007_toyota_camry/index.html|title=2008 Honda Accord vs. 2007 Toyota Camry - Head to Head|publisher=Motor Trend|accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl] Numerous road tests, past and present, rate the Accord as one of the world's most reliable vehicles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/go/5657/|title=The 100 most reliable cars of the last decade (in order)|publisher=Gizmag.com |date=2006-05-21 |accessdate=2009-04-28[/tpl] The Accord has been on the Car and Driver 10Best list a record 28 times.
Since initiation, Honda has offered several different car body styles and versions of the Accord, and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially. It debuted in 1976 as a compact hatchback, though this style only lasted through 1981, as the line-up was expanded to include a sedan, coupé, and wagon. By the Accord's sixth generation in the 1990s, it evolved into an intermediate vehicle, with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets. For the eighth generation of the Accord released for the North America market in 2008, Honda had again chosen to move the model further up-scale and increase its size.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/honda/accord/2008/|title=2008 Honda Accord Review|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=2011-04-03[/tpl] This pushed the Accord sedan from the upper limit of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines as a mid-size car

[[Ring of symmetric functions]]

CATEGORIES: Polynomials, Invariant theory, Algebraic combinatorics, Symmetric functions, Permutations, Types of functions

In algebra and in particular in algebraic combinatorics, the ring of symmetric functions, is a specific limit of the rings of symmetric polynomials in n indeterminates, as n goes to infinity. This ring serves as universal structure in which relations between symmetric polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number n of indeterminates (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions). Among other things, this ring plays an important role in the representation theory of the symmetric groups.
The ring of symmetric functions can be given a coproduct and a bilinear form making it into a positive selfadjoint graded Hopf algebra that is both commutative and cocommutative.

The Chairman and Vice Chairman may not be members of the same armed force service branch. However, the President may waive that restriction for a limited period of time in order to provide for the orderly transition of officers appointed to serve in those positions.  The Vice Chairman serves a two-year term of office at the pleasure of the President, but can be reappointed to serve two additional terms for a total of six years. In case of times of war or nation emergency, there is no limit to how many times an officer can be reappointed to serve as Vice Chairman. Historically, the Vice Chairman has served two terms. By statute, the Vice Chairman is appointed as a four-star general or admiral.

[[Absorption spectroscopy]]
CATEGORIES: Scientific techniques, Analytical chemistry, Spectroscopy, Electromagnetic radiation, Astrochemistry, Radiation

Absorption spectroscopy refers to spectroscopic techniques that measure the absorption of radiation, as a function of frequency or wavelength, due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the absorption spectrum. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the electromagnetic spectrum.
Absorption spectroscopy is employed as an analytical chemistry tool to determine the presence of a particular substance in a sample and, in many cases, to quantify the amount of the substance present. Infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy are particularly common in analytical applications. Absorption spectroscopy is also employed in studies of molecular and atomic physics, astronomical spectroscopy and remote sensing.
There are a wide range of experimental approaches to measuring absorption spectra. The most common arrangement is to direct a generated beam of radiation at a sample and detect the intensity of the radiation that passes through it. The transmitted energy can be used to calculate the absorption. The source, sample arrangement and detection technique vary significantly depending on the frequency range and the purpose of the experiment.

Brian Coffey (8 June 1905 – 14 April 1995) was an Irish poet and publisher. His work was informed by his Catholicism and by his background in science and philosophy, and his connection to surrealism. For these reasons, he is seen as being closer to an intellectual European Catholic tradition than to mainstream Irish Catholic culture. Two of his long poems published in later years, Advent (1975) and Death of Hektor (1979), are widely considered to be among the most important works in the canon of Irish poetic modernism. He also ran Advent, a small press, during the 1960s and 1970s.

[[Aa (orchid)]]

CATEGORIES: Orchidoideae genera, Neotropic ecozone flora

Aa Rchb.f. 1854, is a genus of plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae.
Species in this genus can be found growing terrestrially in cold habitats near the snowline in the Andes and also in Costa Rica; they are usually found close to small streams. The elongated inflorescence grows from a basal rosette of leaves, terminating in a small white non-resupinate flower. This lip is fringed and hood-shaped. The flower gives off a pungent smell that attracts flies. This genus has often been included in the orchid genus Altensteinia.
The first scientific description of a species of this genus was made in 1815 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, naming it first Ophrys paleacea Kunth (1806)., and later Altensteinia paleacea. In 1854 Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach separated Aa from Altensteinia, to include two species Aa argyrolepis and Aa paleacea. The genus name apparently was rendered by the author to always appear first in alphabetical listings. Another - disputed - explanation, is that Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach named this genus after Pieter van der Aa; the printer of the Dutch botanist Paul Herman's "Paradisus Batavus".[tpl]Cite web |url=http://falco.elte.hu/eoc/ParadisusBatavus.htm |title= Paradisus batavus |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020219095614/http://falco.elte.hu/eoc/ParadisusBatavus.htm |archivedate=2002-02-19[/tpl] A few years later, Reichenbach reviewed the name of the genus and named it again Altensteinia. Finally in 1912 Rudolf Schlechter switched the name again to Aa, as more species were being discovered making the new name more significant.

[[Thorn Lighting]]

CATEGORIES: Lighting brands

Thorn Lighting Ltd, a subsidiary of the Austrian company Zumtobel Group, is a global supplier of both outdoor and indoor luminaires and integrated controls.
Thorn was founded when Sir Jules Thorn started The Electric Lamp Service Company Ltd, in 1928, dealing in incandescent filament lamps. In 1936, renamed Thorn Electrical Industries Ltd, the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange. Continuous post-war expansion followed and the organisation seized a variety of lighting, engineering and consumer electronics businesses, merging with EMI in 1979 to create Thorn EMI, which itself demerged in the mid-1990s.
In 1994, following a leveraged management buy-out, Thorn Lighting Ltd floated on the London Stock Exchange as TLG plc (the Thorn Lighting Group) until it was acquired by Wassall plc four years later. In 2000, Wassall plc was purchased in order to merge TLG with the luminaire business of the Zumtobel Group, an acquisition financed with the assistance of private equity firm KKR who subsequently reduced its position. Thorn is now fully owned by the Zumtobel Group.

Thomas Gallaudet (June 3, 1822 – August 27, 1902), an American Episcopal priest, was born in Hartford, Connecticut. His father, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, was the renowned pioneer of deaf education in the United States. His mother, Sophia Fowler Gallaudet, who was deaf, was the founding matron of the school that became Gallaudet University.
After graduating from Trinity College in Hartford, Gallaudet accepted a teaching position in the New York Institution for Deaf-mutes, where he met and married a deaf woman, Elizabeth Budd. They had seven children, one of whom died in infancy, named Laurent Clerc Gallaudet. He was most certainly named after the man his father brought back from France to help start his Deaf-Mute School, Laurent Clerc. 
Following in his father's footsteps, in 1852, Gallaudet established St. Ann's Church for Deaf Mutes in New York City; in 1885, he established the Gallaudet Home for Deaf-Mutes near Poughkeepsie.
One of Gallaudet's students, Henry Winter Syle, became the first deaf person to be ordained by the Episcopal Church. Both Gallaudet and Syle are listed in the Episcopal Church's Calendar of Saints for August 27.
Gallaudet is buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.

[[Welsummer]]

CATEGORIES: Chicken breeds, Chicken breeds originating in the Netherlands

It was bred at the beginning of the 20th century from local fowls of mixed origin: Rhode Island Reds, Barnevelders, Partridge Leghorns, Cochins, and Wyandottes. In 1922-23 steps were taken to fix a standard after the birds began to show a good deal of uniformity. The eggs were originally exported for the commercial egg trade where they were an instant hit. Soon after stock was imported into England. The breed was added to the British Standard in 1930.
It is a light, friendly, and intelligent breed, with rustic-red and orange colour. Representations of cockerels in the media are often based upon the "classic" Welsummer look. The most common example of this would be the Kelloggs Cornflakes rooster. There are three variations of the standard Welsummer, these are the Partridge, Silver Duckwing and the Gold Duckwing. There is also a Bantam Welsummer breed which is similar but lays light brown eggs. Bantams exist in both Partridge and Silver Duckwing colours but are quite rare in North America.

There have been at least sixteen sieges of Stirling Castle, a strategically important fortification in Stirling, Scotland. Stirling is located at the crossing of the River Forth, making it a key location for access to the north of Scotland. The castle changed hands several times between English and Scottish control during the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357).
In 1299, the castle was in English hands, when the constable, John Sampson, was besieged by the Scots. In 1304, Edward I of England besieged the Scots, deploying siege engines to force the garrison to surrender. In 1337, a siege by Sir Andrew Murray failed to retake the castle. Between 1571 and 1585, the castle was besieged three times by Scots factions during the reign of James VI. In 1651, Oliver Cromwell captured the castle during his invasion of Scotland. The final siege took place in 1746, when Charles Edward Stuart besieged the castle during the final Jacobite Rising.

[[Identity document]]
CATEGORIES: Authentication methods, International travel documents, Personal documents, Personal identification documents

An identity document (also called a piece of identification or ID, or colloquially as one's 'papers') is any document which may be used to verify aspects of a person's personal identity. If issued in the form of a small, mostly standard-sized card, it is usually called an identity card (IC or ID card). Countries which do not have formal identity documents may require identity verification using informal documents.
In the absence of a formal identity document, driving licences may be accepted in many countries for identity verification. Some countries do not accept driving licences for identification, often because in those countries they do not expire as documents and can be old or easily forged. Most countries accept passports as a form of identification.
Some countries require foreigners to have a passport or occasionally a national identity card from their country available at any time if they do not have residence permit in the country.
The personal information present on the identity document, or in a supporting database, might include the bearer's full name, a portrait photo, age, birth date, address, an identification number, profession or rank, religion, ethnic or racial classification, restrictions, and citizenship status.

Dura-Europos ([tpl]lang-el|Δοῦρα Εὐρωπός[/tpl]), also spelled Dura-Europus, was a Hellenistic, Parthian and Roman border city built on an escarpment 90 m above the right bank of the Euphrates river. It is located near the village of Salhiyé, in today's Syria.
Dura-Europos is extremely important for archaeological reasons. As it was abandoned after its conquest in 256–7, nothing was built over it and no later building programs obscured the architectonic features of the ancient city. Its location on the edge of empires made for a co-mingling of cultural traditions, much of which was preserved under the city's ruins. Some remarkable finds have been brought to light, including numerous temples, wall decorations, inscriptions, military equipment, tombs, and even dramatic evidence of the Sassanian siege during the Imperial Roman period which led to the site's abandonment.

The Muscovy Duck (Cairina moschata) is a large duck native to Mexico, Central, and South America. Small wild and feral breeding populations have established themselves in the United States, particularly in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, as well as in many other parts of North America, including southern Canada. Feral Muscovy Ducks are found in New Zealand and have also been reported in parts of Europe.
They are a large duck, with the males about 76 cm or 30 inches long, and weighing up to 7 kg or 15 pounds.  Females are considerably smaller, and only grow to 3 kg or 7 pounds, roughly half the males' size.  The bird is predominantly black and white, with the back feathers being iridescent and glossy in males, while the females are more drab.  The amount of white on the neck and head is variable, as well as the bill, which can be yellow, pink, black, or any mixture of these.  They may have white patches or bars on the wings, which become more noticeable during flight. Both sexes have pink or red wattles around the bill, those of the male being larger and more brightly colored.
Although the Muscovy Duck is a tropical bird, it adapts well to cooler climates, thriving in weather as cold as −12°C (10°F) and able to survive even colder conditions.Holderread (2001): p. 17[tpl]cite web|url=http://nis.gsmfc.org/nis_factsheet.php?toc_id=210 |title=Non-Native Aquatic Species in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Regions |publisher=Nis.gsmfc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06[/tpl] In general, Barbary Duck is the term used for C. moschata in a culinary context.
The domestic breed, Cairina moschata forma domestica, is commonly known in Spanish as the pato criollo ("creole duck"). They have been bred since pre-Columbian times by Native Americans and are heavier and less able to fly long distances than the wild subspecies. Their plumage color are also more variable. Other names for the domestic breed in Spanish are pato casero ("backyard duck") and pato mudo ("mute duck").

[[Juan Laurentino Ortiz (Argentine poet)]]

CATEGORIES: 1896 births, 1978 deaths, Argentine poets, People from Entre Ríos Province

Juan Laurentino Ortiz (June 11, 1896 - September 2, 1978) was an Argentine poet, born in the town of Puerto Ruiz, Entre Ríos Province. He died in Paraná, capital of the same province, at the age of 82.
He spent his childhood in the wilds of Montiel, a landscape that forever marked his poetry.
He studied philosophy and lived a short time in Buenos Aires, but soon returned to his province. Although he joined some political movements, he lived mostly isolated from the cultural climate of Argentina's capital and only traveled abroad once at the invitation of the communist government of China.
His extensive work identified the mind with the landscape that surrounded him throughout his life in a "splendid monotony". The image of his tall and thin figure in concentrated observation of the river scenery transcended his work and became a literary legend. 'Juanele', as he began to be called in the literary circles of the Argentinian capital, published his poems of long verses in lowercase typography, taking painstaking care of every aspect of the manuscript. As a result, these characteristics tended to be respected by his publishers in the published version of his poems.
The symbolism of French and Oriental poetry influenced his work, which was characterized by delicacy and a contemplative disposition which often referred to rivers, trees, floods, and the changes of the seasons without skirting the social history of his home province. At the same time, his poems exhibit a special sensitivity to the "drama of poverty" and, in particular, the suffering of innocent children. One of his well-known poems, "The Gualeguay", is a narrative of both the landscape and historical and economic events that occurred on the banks of one of the rivers in the province.

Sidney Arthur Lumet ([tpl]IPAc-en|l|uː|ˈ|m|ɛ|t[/tpl] [tpl]respell|loo|MET|'[/tpl]; June 25, 1924 – April 9, 2011) was an American director, producer and screenwriter with over 50 films to his credit. He was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Director for 12 Angry Men (1957), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Network (1976) and The Verdict (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, but he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as Network, which was nominated for ten, winning four.
The Encyclopedia of Hollywood states that Lumet was one of the most prolific directors of the modern era, making more than one movie per year on average since his directorial debut in 1957. He was noted by Turner Classic Movies for his "strong direction of actors", "vigorous storytelling" and the "social realism" in his best work."TCM Biography" Film critic Roger Ebert described him as having been "one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors."Ebert, Roger. "Sidney Lumet: In memory" Chicago Sun Times, April 9, 2011 Lumet was also known as an "actor's director," having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than "any other director." Sean Connery, who acted in five of his films, considered him one of his favorite directors, and a director who had that "vision thing.""Sidney Lumet", The Sunday Herald, Scotland, April 10, 2011

His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered "problem picture," 12 Angry Men (1957).  From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies.[tpl]cite book|last=Messina|first=Elizabeth|title=What's His Name?

In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his "brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture." Two years later, he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007). A few months after Lumet's death in April 2011, a retrospective celebration of his work was held at New York's Lincoln Center with the appearance of numerous speakers and film stars.Fleming, Mike.

[[Mahuika crater]]
CATEGORIES: Geology of New Zealand, Possible impact craters on Earth, Holocene impact craters

Mahuika crater is a submarine bolide impact crater, 20 ± 2 km wide and over 153 m deep, on the New Zealand continental shelf named after the Māori god of fire. It was discovered by Dallas Abbott and her colleagues from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of the Columbia University.
Around the year 1400, the natives of New Zealand abandoned their southern coastal settlements. New Zealand tsunami expert Professor James Goff attributes coastal abandonment in New Zealand at 1500 AD to an earthquake-induced tsunami event. However, the largest historical earthquakes produced maximum tsunami runups of 40 to 60 metres. On Stewart Island, New Zealand, beach sand is present ~220 metres above sea level at Hellfire Hut and ~150 metres above sea level at Mason Bay. In eastern Australia, there are megatsunami deposits with maximum run-ups of over 130 metres and a C-14 age of ~1500 AD2. Megatsunami deposits occur on the eastern side of Lord Howe Island in the middle of the Tasman Sea, implying a source crater for the tsunami further east. Abbott et al. (2003) suggests that a bolide impact would explain both the geological and anthropological evidence better than an earthquake.
Based on elemental anomalies, fossils, and minerals, which are interpreted to be derived from the impact, found in an ice core from the Siple Dome in Antarctica, Abbott et al. (2005) believes that the impact, which created the Mahuika crater occurred around 1443 AD.

The  Nepali Congress (abbreviated NC, and commonly known as the Congress) is a Nepalese political party. Nepali Congress led the 1950 Democratic Movement which successfully ended the Rana dynasty and allowed commoners to take part in the politics. It again led democratic movements in 1990 and 2006, in partnership with leftist forces, to end absolute monarchy and reinstate parliamentary democracy. With the 12-point agreement of November 22, 2005 it worked together with the CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist to end King Gyanendra's takeover of the government. The ensuing 2006 movement successfully reinstated the parliament and led to the formation of the Federal Republic of Nepal.
In the most recent elections, the NC emerged as the largest party in the Constituent Assembly winning 196 out of 575 seats.

Viborg and Nyslott County ([tpl]lang-sv|Viborgs och Nyslotts län[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|Viipurin ja Savonlinnan lääni[/tpl]) was a county of the Swedish Empire from 1634 to 1721. The county was named after the castle towns of Viborg ([tpl]lang-fi|Viipuri[/tpl]) and Nyslott ([tpl]lang-fi|Savonlinna[/tpl], literally New Castle), today located in the towns of Vyborg in Russia and Savonlinna in Finland.
The county was established in 1634 as Karelia County ([tpl]lang-sv|Karelens län[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|Karjalan lääni[/tpl]), but in 1641 Nyslott County ([tpl]lang-sv|Nyslotts län[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|Savonlinnan lääni[/tpl]) was broken out and made a separate entity. Remainder of Karelia County was now called Viborg County. In 1650 the counties were joined again as the Viborg and Nyslott County.
Following the Great Northern War southeastern parts of the county were ceded to Russia in 1721, and the territory that remained was reconsitituted into the County of Kymmenegård and Nyslott ([tpl]lang-sv|Kymmenegårds och Nyslotts län[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|Savonlinnan ja Kymenkartanon lääni[/tpl]), with the northern and western parts of County of Kexholm. In 1743 following a new conflict part of this county was also ceded to Russia in the Treaty of Åbo. The ceded parts of the County of Viborg and Nyslott and the County of Kexholm were at first part of the Saint Petersburg Governorate, but in 1744 they were reconsitituted with new conquests into the Russian Vyborg Governorate, which also became known as Old Finland. Remainder of the County of Kymmenegård and Nyslott was joined with some parts of the County of Nyland and Tavastehus in 1747 into the County of Savolax and Kymmenegård.
After the Russian victory in the Finnish War in 1809, Sweden ceded all its territory in Finland to Russia by the Treaty of Fredrikshamn. As part of Russian Empire Finland became to constitute a separate grand duchy. In 1812 Russia made the territories of Vyborg Governorate part of the new Grand Duchy of Finland as Viipuri Province.

[[Trade card]]
CATEGORIES: Business cards, Ephemera, Stationery

Trade card describes small cards, similar to the visiting cards exchanged in social circles, that businesses would distribute to clients and potential customers. Trade cards first became popular at the beginning of the 17th century in London. These functioned as advertising and also as maps, directing the public to merchants' stores, as no formal street address numbering system existed at the time.
The trade card is an early example of the modern business card. Some businesses began to create increasingly sophisticated designs, especially with the development of color printing. A few companies specialized in producing stock cards, usually with an image on one side and space on the other side for the business to add its own information. As the designs became more attractive and colorful, collecting trade cards became a popular hobby in the late 19th century, since color images were not yet widely available.
In its original sense, the "trade" in trade card refers to its use by the proprietor of a business to announce his trade, or line of business. By moving into the realm of collecting, trade cards gave rise to the trading card, the meaning now shifting to the exchange or trade of cards by enthusiasts. Some cards, particularly those produced by tobacco companies featuring baseball players, later developed into collectibles and lost their function as a business advertisement.

The Parachute Regiment, colloquially known as the Paras, is the Airborne Infantry of the British Army. One battalion is permanently under the command of the Director Special Forces in the Special Forces Support Group. The other battalions are the parachute infantry component of the British Army's rapid response formation 16 Air Assault Brigade. It is the only line infantry regiment that has not been amalgamated with another unit since the end of the Second World War. Members of the Parachute Regiment are often colloquially known to the rest of the army and the British public as the "Paras".
The Parachute Regiment was formed during the Second World War and eventually raised 17 battalions. In Europe, these battalions formed part of the 1st Airborne Division, the 6th Airborne Division and the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade. Another three battalions served with the British Indian Army in India and Burma. The regiment took part in five major parachute assault operations in North Africa, Italy, Greece, France, the Netherlands and Germany, often landing ahead of all other troops.
At the end of the Second World War, the regiment was reduced to three regular army battalions first assigned to the 16th Parachute Brigade and later the 5th Airborne Brigade. The reserve 16th Airborne Division was formed using the regiment reserve battalions in the Territorial Army (TA). Defence cuts gradually reduced the TA formations to a parachute brigade and then a single reserve battalion. In the same time period, the regular army battalions have taken part in operations in Suez, Cyprus, Borneo, Aden, Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan, at times being reinforced by men from the reserve battalion.

The Governor-General of the Union of South Africa was the representative of the British (1910–1931) and later South African Crown (1931–1961) in the Union of South Africa between 31 May 1910 and 31 May 1961. The Union of South Africa was a Commonwealth realm in which Queen Elizabeth II was given the title Queen of South Africa, although she never visited the country in that capacity.
Some of the first holders of the post were members of the British Royal Family including Prince Arthur of Connaught, between 1920 and 1924, and the Earl of Athlone, who served between 1924 and 1931, before becoming the Governor General of Canada. As in other Dominions, this would change, and from 1946 onward only local South African citizens held the office.
The office was established by the South Africa Act 1909.  Although he was nominally the country's chief executive, in practice he was bound by convention to act on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.

[[Anomaly (physics)]]
CATEGORIES: Anomalies in physics

In quantum physics an anomaly or quantum anomaly is the failure of a symmetry of a theory's classical action to be a symmetry of any regularization of the full quantum theory.  In classical physics an anomaly is the failure of a symmetry to be restored in the limit in which the symmetry-breaking parameter goes to zero. Perhaps the first known anomaly was the dissipative anomaly in turbulence: time-reversibility remains broken (and energy dissipation rate finite) at the limit of vanishing viscosity.
Technically, an anomalous symmetry in a quantum theory is a symmetry of the action, but not of the measure, and so not of the partition function as a whole.

Like his uncle, he was a canonist, was rector of the University of Toulouse and succeeded his uncle as Bishop of Mende.
Pope John XXII and Charles IV of France sent him on an embassy to the Sultan Orkhan (1326–1360) at Brusa, to obtain more favourable conditions for the Latins in Syria. He died on the way back, in Cyprus (1328 or 1330).

In mathematics, schemes connect the fields of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and number theory. Schemes were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in 1960 in his treatise Éléments de géométrie algébrique, with the aim of developing the formalism needed to solve deep problems of algebraic geometry, such as Weil conjectures (proved by Pierre Deligne).Introduction of the first edition of Éléments de géométrie algébrique Schemes enlarge the notion of algebraic variety to include nilpotent elements (the equations x = 0 and x2 = 0 define the same points, but different schemes), and "varieties" defined over any commutative ring. Some consider schemes to be the basic object of study of modern algebraic geometry.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] Technically, a scheme is a topological space together with commutative rings for all of its open sets, which arises from gluing together spectra (spaces of prime ideals) of commutative rings along their open subsets.

[[Grand Vizier]]

CATEGORIES: Grand Viziers

In the Ottoman Empire, Grand Vizier, deriving from the Arabic word vizier (وزير), was the prime minister of the king, with absolute power of attorney and, in principle, dismissable only by the king himself.Diplomatic documents relating to the outbreak of the European war, Volume 2. By Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. P.1411 He held the imperial seal and could convene all other viziers to attend to affairs of the state; the viziers in conference were called "Kubbealtı viziers" in reference to their meeting place, the Kubbealtı ('under the dome') in Topkapı Palace. His offices were located at the Sublime Porte.
"Grand Vizier" (Vazīr-e Azam) is also the official Urdu title of the Pakistani Prime Minister (ministers are titled "vizier").

[[Conformal field theory]]

CATEGORIES: Symmetry, Scaling symmetries, Conformal field theory

A conformal field theory (CFT) is a quantum field theory, also recognized as a model of statistical mechanics at a thermodynamic critical point, that is invariant under conformal transformations. Conformal field theory is often studied in two dimensions where there is an infinite-dimensional group of local conformal transformations, described by the holomorphic functions.
Conformal field theory has important applications in string theory, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter physics.

She studied biology in Halle and literature at the Johannes R. Becher Institute for Literature in Leipzig. In 1965, she married the writer Rainer Kirsch. She protested against East Germany's expulsion of Wolf Biermann in 1976, which led to her exclusion from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). One year later she left the country herself, nevertheless being critical of the west as well. She is mainly known for her poetry, but she also wrote prose and has translated children's books into German.[ref]

Rose Ausländer (May 11, 1901 – January 3, 1988), maiden name Rosalie Beatrice Scherzer, was a Jewish German- and English language poet. She was born in Bucovina, and lived in the United States, Romania, and Germany.
She was born in Czernowitz, Bucovina, which at that time was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Her father Sigmund (Süssi) Scherzer (1871–1920) was from a small town near Czernowitz, and her mother Kathi Etie Rifke Binder (1873–1947) was born in Czernowitz to a German-speaking family.Rose Ausländers Leben und Dichtung (Rose Ausländer life and poetry). „Ein denkendes Herz, das singt“ ("A thinking heart that sings") Between 1907 and 1919, she received her primary and secondary education in Vienna and Czernowitz, which became part of Romania after 1918.
In 1919, she began studying literature and philosophy in Czernowitz. She developed at this time a lifelong devotion to the philosopher Constantin Brunner. 
After her father died in 1920, she gave up her studies. In 1921, together with her friend and future husband Ignaz Ausländer, she left Bukovina, and migrated to the United States. Here, she worked as an editor for the newspaper Westlicher Herold, and she began writing poems. In 1927, her first poems were published in the Amerika-Herold-Kalender, which she edited.
On October 19, 1923 she married Ausländer in New York. A mere 3 years later, they divorced, presumably because of a boring family life. In the same year, she became an American citizen. In 1927, she returned home for eight months to take care of her sick mother. In 1931, she returned home again for the same reason; there she met graphologist Helios Hecht, with whom she lived until 1936. Because she hadn't been in America for more than 3 years, she meanwhile lost her American citizenship. After breaking up with Hecht, she left Czernowitz for Bucharest in 1936.
In 1939, her first volume of poems, Der Regenbogen (The Rainbow) was published after intermediation of Alfred Margul-Sperber. Even though it was a success with the critics, it was not accepted by the public. The greater part of the print run was destroyed by command of the Nazis in 1941, after they had occupied the city. As a Jew, she had to move into the ghetto of Czernowitz. She remained there 2 years, plus another year in hiding so as not to be deported to the camps. In the ghetto, she got to know Paul Celan, under whose influence she modernised her style, leaving behind her classic-expressionist tone. In spring 1944, the Nazis had to withdraw and the city was occupied by the Red Army. She left the country again, returning to New York, where she again was given American citizenship in 1948. She was able to meet Celan only once more, in 1957 in Paris. After the trauma of persecution, she began writing in English and only in 1956 did she resume writing texts in German.
When she published her second volume of poems, Blinder Sommer (Blind summer), in 1965, it was welcomed enthusiastically by the public. In 1967, she returned to West Germany. From then on, she lived in Düsseldorf; she was bedridden from 1978 due to arthritis. She had to dictate her texts, as she was not able to write by herself. She died in Düsseldorf in 1988.

Assad graduated from the medical school of Damascus University in 1988, and started to work as a physician in the army. Four years later, he attended postgraduate studies at the Western Eye Hospital, in London, specializing in ophthalmology. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel was killed in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as heir apparent. He entered the military academy, taking charge of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon in 1998. In December 2000, Assad married Asma Assad, née Akhras.

It is the same construction used for quotient groups and quotient rings.
Given a module A over a ring R, and a submodule B of A, the quotient space A/B is defined by the equivalence relation
for any a and b in A.  The elements of A/B are the equivalence classes a = { a + b : b in B }.
The addition operation on A/B is defined for two equivalence classes as the equivalence class of the sum of two representatives from these classes; and in the same way for  multiplication by elements of R.  In this way A/B becomes itself a module over R, called the quotient module.  In symbols, a + b = a+b, and r·a = r·a, for all a,b in A and r in R.

The Balkan range runs 560 km from the Vrashka Chuka / Vrška Čuka Peak on the border between Bulgaria and eastern Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea. The highest peaks of the Stara planina are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is Botev (2,376 m), located in the Central Balkan National Park (established 1991). The mountain gives the name of the Balkan Peninsula. Stara planina played an enormous role in the history of Bulgaria and the development of the Bulgarian nation and people.
In earlier times the mountains were known as the Haemus Mons. Scholars consider that Haemus (Greek  Emos) is derived from an unattested Thracian word[tpl]Dubious|date=September 2011[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] *saimon, meaning 'mountain range'. Other names used to refer to the mountains in different time periods include Aemon, Haemimons, Hem, Emus, the Slavonic Matorni gori, the Turkish Kodzhabalkan and Balkan.
Stara Planina is remarkable for its flora and fauna. Edelweiss grows there in the region of Kozyata stena. Some of the most striking landscapes are included in the Central Balkan National Park with steep cliffs, the highest waterfalls in the Balkan Peninsula and lush vegetation. There are a number of important nature reserves such as Chuprene, Kozyata stena and others. Most of Europe's large mammals inhabit the area including the brown bear, wolf, boar, chamois and deer.

[[Coat of arms of Åland]]

CATEGORIES: Finnish heraldry, History of the Åland Islands, Finnish coats of arms

The coat of arms of Åland features a golden red deer on a blue field. This is traditionally surmounted by a comital coronet of the elder Swedish style.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kunnat.net/k_perussivu.asp?path=1;29;102942;486;85008 |title=Maakuntien vaakunat |language=Finnish |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070221072304/http://www.kunnat.net/k_perussivu.asp?path=1;29;102942;486;85008 |archivedate=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2013-07-19[/tpl]
The arms borne today by the Åland islands were originally granted to the similar-sounding island province of Öland in 1560, displaying a golden red deer on a blue field.  In 1569, Åland had been given to the Swedish queen dowager Katarina Stenbock as a fief and was awarded a provincial coat of arms displaying two roe deer on a field strewn with nine roses.  The arms of these two similar-sounding Swedish provinces became confused early on, and in the 1880s Öland's arms were recorded as two roe deer with nine roses.[tpl]Cite book |last1=Nevéus |first1=Clara |last2=Wærn |first2=Jacques de |title=Ny Svensk Vapenbok |year=1992 |language=Swedish |location=Stockholm, Sweden |publisher=Streiffert & Co Bokförlag HB |isbn=91-7886-092-X |page=32[/tpl]
Sweden had ceded much of its eastern territority, including the Åland Islands, to Russia in 1809, which became the Grand Duchy of Finland, but the heraldic switch-up was not discovered until the 1940s.
During a heraldic revision in 1944, the Swedish National Heraldry Office (Riksheraldikerämbetet) discovered that a mistake had been committed. Heraldic authorities in Finland were notified of the error but ultimately decided not make any changes and not to adopt the coat of arms originally intended for Åland (with the two roe deer and nine Finnish roses), as they had long since granted Åland the arms which had been usurped from Öland. This decision made it necessary for Swedish heralds to once again alter the coat of arms for Öland, to avoid further confusion. It was then decided in 1944 that the Öland deer should have a red collar and attire to distinguish it from the arms which had been first granted to Öland but now belonged to Åland.

[[Salary cap]]
CATEGORIES: Sports culture, Terminology used in multiple sports, Personnel economics, Employment compensation

In professional sports, a salary cap (or wage cap) is an agreement or rule that places a limit on the amount of money that a team can spend on player salaries. The limit exists as a per-player limit or a total limit for the team's roster, or both. Several sports leagues have implemented salary caps, both as a method of keeping overall costs down, and to ensure parity between teams so wealthy teams cannot entrench dominance by signing many more top players than their rivals. Salary caps can be a major issue in negotiations between league management and players' unions, and has been the focus point of several strikes by players and lockouts by owners and administrators.http://amog.com/sports/101341-professional-sports-disputes/http://www.midwestsportsfans.com/2011/10/the-10-most-significant-pro-sports-strikes-and-lockouts/

The Bell P-59 Airacomet was the first American jet fighter aircraft, designed and built by Bell Aircraft during World War II.  The United States Army Air Force was not impressed by its performance and cancelled the contract when fewer than half of the aircraft ordered had been produced.  Although no P-59s went into combat, it paved the way for another design generation of U.S. turbojet-powered aircraft and was the first turbojet fighter to have its turbojet engine and air inlet nacelles integrated within the main fuselage.

The Right Honourable Sir Patrick Duncan, GCMG, PC (1870–1943) was the sixth Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, holding office from 1937 to 1943.
Born in Scotland in 1870, he took degrees in classics at the University of Edinburgh and at Balliol College, Oxford, and studied law in the Inner Temple, before joining the British civil service.
In 1901, during the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902), he was recruited by Viscount Milner, to join a team of young administrators - known as "Milner's Kindergarten" - to govern and anglicise the British-occupied Transvaal.  He was Colonial Secretary of the Transvaal from 1903 until the colony was granted self-government in 1907, playing an important part in the repatriation of ex-prisoners of war, and in the social and financial reconstruction of the former Boer state.
Duncan practised as an attorney from 1907 to 1910, and was a legal adviser to the Transvaal delegation to the 1908-1909 National Convention that drew up the constitution for the Union of South Africa.
He was a member of the Union Parliament from 1910 to 1936, first as a member of the Unionist Party, then of the South African Party and its successor the United Party.  He was Minister of Education, the Interior, and Public Health in the SAP administration from 1921 to 1924, and Minister of Mines in the UP administration from 1933 to 1936.
Duncan was appointed Governor-General in 1937, the first South African appointee to hold the post.  King George VI, whom he represented as head of state, knighted him and appointed him to the Privy Council.
Although widely respected and above party politics, he made himself controversial in 1939 by refusing to call a general election on the question of whether or not the Union should enter World War II.
The prime minister, General Hertzog, wanted to stay neutral, but Parliament supported his deputy, General Smuts, who proposed to declare war.  Hertzog resigned, Smuts became prime minister and led the country into war, and political re-alignments followed.
Sir Patrick died in office, in 1943.  His ashes were interred in a monument at the new Duncan Dock in Cape Town harbour, which was named after him.  The suburb of Duncan Village in East London, and the suburb of Duncanville near Vereeniging, were also named after him.
Sir Patrick married Alice Dold in 1916.  They had three sons and a daughter.  One son, Andrew (1920–1942), was killed on active service in Libya.  Another son, Patrick (1918–1967), was a well-known anti-apartheid activist.

[[Culture of South Africa]]

CATEGORIES: South African culture

The culture of South Africa is known for its ethnic and cultural diversity. The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and Westernised, aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak English or Afrikaans in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of Khoisan languages, not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of endangered languages, most of which are from the Khoisan family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.
Members of middle class, who are predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of people of colour, have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and Australia. Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world.
Indian South Africans preserve their cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either Christian, Hindu or Muslim and speaking English, with Indian languages like Hindi, Telugu, Tamil or Gujarati being spoken less frequently as second languages. The first Indians arrived on the Truro ship as indentured labourers in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields, while the rest arrived as traders. A post-apartheid wave of South Asian (including Pakistani) immigration has also influenced South African Indian culture. There is a much smaller Chinese South African community, made up of early immigrants, apartheid-era immigrants from Taiwan, and post-apartheid immigrants from mainland China.

[[Namib-Naukluft National Park]]

CATEGORIES: National parks of Namibia, Protected areas established in 1979

 
The Namib-Naukluft National Park is a national park of Namibia encompassing part of the Namib Desert (considered the world's oldest desert) and the Naukluft mountain range. With an overall area of [tpl]convert|49,768|km2|abbr=on[/tpl], the Namib-Naukluft is the largest game park in Africa and the fourth largest in the world.Namib Naukluft Park The most well-known area of the park is Sossusvlei, which is the main visitor attraction in Namibia.
A surprising collection of creatures survives in the hyper-arid region, including snakes, geckos, unusual insects, hyenas, gemsboks and jackals. More moisture comes in as a fog off the Atlantic Ocean than falls as rain, with the average 106 millimeters of rainfall per year concentrated in the months of February and April.
left|thumb|250px|Ancient dunes near Sossusvlei, in the relatively frequently visited center of the national park, accessible by road from Sesriem.The winds that bring in the fog are also responsible for creating the park’s towering sand dunes, whose burnt orange color is a sign of their age. The orange color develops over time as iron in the sand is oxidized, like rusty metal; the older the dune, the brighter the color. 
These dunes are the tallest in the world, in places rising more than 300 meters (almost 1000 feet) above the desert floor. The dunes taper off near the coast, and lagoons, wetlands, and mudflats located along the shore attract hundreds of thousands of birds.
‘Namib’ means open space and the Namib Desert gave its name to form Namibia – “land of open spaces”. The park was established in 1907 when the German Colonial Administration proclaimed the area between the Swakop River and the Kuiseb River a game reserve. The park's present boundaries were established in 1978 by the merging of the Namib Desert Park, the Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park and parts of Diamond Area 1 and some other bits of surrounding government land. 
The park has some of the most unusual wildlife and nature reserves in the world, and covers an area of [tpl]convert|49,768|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. It's an area larger than Switzerland (41,285 km²), roughly the size of the US states New Hampshire and Vermont combined. The region is characterised by high, isolated inselbergs and kopjes (the Afrikaans term for rocky outcrops), made up of dramatic blood red granites, rich in feldspars and sandstone. The easternmost part of the park covers the Naukluft Mountains.

Theodore Dwight Weld (November 23, 1803 – February 3, 1895), was one of the leading architects of the American abolitionist movement during its formative years, from 1830 through 1844.
Weld played a role as writer, editor, speaker, and organizer. He is best known for his co-authorship of the authoritative compendium, American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses, published in 1839. Harriet Beecher Stowe partly based Uncle Tom’s Cabin on Weld's text and it is regarded as second only to that work in its influence on the antislavery movement. Weld remained dedicated to the abolitionist movement until slavery was ended by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.Columbia 2003 Encyclopedia Article Columbia 2003 Encyclopedia Article

Porcupine Tree are an English rock band formed by musician  Steven Wilson in 1987. The band began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the band's music. However, by 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri on keyboards, Colin Edwin on bass and Chris Maitland on drums as permanent band members. With Wilson still in charge of guitar and lead vocals, this would remain the lineup until 2001, when the band recruited Gavin Harrison to replace Maitland on drums.
Porcupine Tree's early sound evokes a style of psychedelic rock comparable to that of progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Upon signing with  Kscope record label in the late 1990s, the band approached a more mainstream alternative rock sound. By the early  2000s, the band signed to a major record label and shifted their sound again, this time in a more progressive metal direction.
After the release and tour in support of their tenth studio album, The Incident, the band became inactive as Wilson began to focus on his solo career. While not formally broken up, they also have no particular reformation plans beyond "someday", with members all working on separate projects, and Wilson committing himself to his solo work through most of 2015.

[[Music of Barbados]]

CATEGORIES: Barbadian music

The music of Barbados includes distinctive national styles of folk and popular music, including elements of Western classical and religious music. The culture of Barbados is a syncretic mix of African and British elements, and the island's music reflects this mix through song types and styles, instrumentation, dances, and aesthetic principles.
Barbadian folk traditions include the Landship movement, which is a satirical, informal organization based on the British navy, tea meetings, tuk bands and numerous traditional songs and dances. In modern Barbados, popular styles include calypso, spouge, contemporary folk and world music. Barbados is, along with Guadeloupe, Martinique, Trinidad, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, one of the few centers for Caribbean jazz.De Ledesma and Popplewell, pg. 518

[[Music of Anguilla]]

CATEGORIES: Anguillan culture, Music of British Overseas Territories, Lesser Antillean music

The music of Anguilla is part of the Lesser Antillean music area. The earliest people of the island were the Caribs and Arawaks, who arrived from South America. English settlers from St Kitts and Irish people later colonised the island. Unlike regional neighbours, however, the plantation system of agriculture that relied on chattel slavery never took root in Anguilla, causing a distinctly independent cultural makeup. The most recent influences on Anguilla's musical life come from elsewhere in the Caribbean, especially the music of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica, as well as abroad, especially the music of the United States and the United Kingdom. Anguilla's Rastafarian heritage has played a role in the island's music and culture and produced influential figures like activist Ijahnya Christian and Robert Athlyi Rogers, author of The Holy Piby.Anguilla Guide
The island has produced a number of popular reggae, calypso, soca and country musicians. Of these, the last is especially characteristic, as country is not otherwise a part of much Caribbean popular music. Anguilla's Island Harbour, an Irish-settled village on the east side of the island, is a major centre for local country music.Anguilla Vibe: The Story of Island Harbour Soca is a major recent import that has become the most important form of dance music on Anguilla; it is often accompanied by frenzied, sexualised dancing called wukin up.Anguilla Vibe: Wukin Up- Cultural Expression or Vulgar Gyration
Perhaps the most famous musician from Anguilla and one of the Caribbean's most acclaimed recording artists is Bankie Banx. Banx has released over ten albums and has played with such music legends such as Bob Dylan, Jimmy Cliff and Jimmy Buffett. He has also opened a popular music bar called the Dune Preserve, built in order to save the Rendezvous Bay dune; the Dune Preserve is home to the Moonsplash Annual Music Festival.Cameron, pg. 525 More recent popular successes include the soca group Xtreme Band, who gained regional fame following their success in the 2001 Carnival.Art Guide of Anguilla: Xtreme Band
Music institutions in Anguilla include the Soroptimist Club and the annual Tranquility Jazz Festival, though the island's most famous music celebration is Carnival, held near the beginning of August (the first Friday after the first Monday); it includes calypso competitions, j'ouvert, street dances, boat races, costumed parades and stilt walking, and beachside barbecues.Anguilla News Anguillans also celebrate the anniversary of emancipation in August, and British holidays like the Queen's birthday. For the first time in 2005, Anguilla was home to a Country Music Festival, which was promoted by American country star Billy Ray Cyrus; in addition to Cyrus and other American musicians. Other popular musicians from Anguilla include Evan Webster,Art Guide of Anguilla: Evan Webster the most famous recent performer to emerge from the island's country music heritage.

[[William Molineux]]
CATEGORIES: 1717 births, 1774 deaths, Colonial American merchants, Colonial American smugglers, Patriots in the American Revolution, People from colonial Boston, Massachusetts, People of Massachusetts in the American Revolution, Huguenot Participants in the American Revolution

There are several people bearing the name of William Mol'y'neux: for the list, see Molyneux (surname)
William Molineux (c. 1717 – October 22, 1774) was a hardware merchant in colonial Boston of Irish descent best known for his role in the Boston Tea Party of 1773 and earlier political protests
Molineux was unusual among the Boston Whigs in having been born in England and emigrating to Massachusetts. He was also not part of the province's Congregationalist orthodoxy, attending an Anglican church and reportedly dabbling with deist views. Insurance records show that Molineux broke British trade laws in his business by sending ships to the Dutch Republic, so he might have been motivated to join the radical cause by increased customs duties and enforcement in the 1760s. Colleagues like John Adams described him as a volatile man.
Molineux rose to prominence leading committees and crowds in demonstrations against the Townshend Acts, seizures by customs officers, and the stationing of British troops in Boston. He also organized a public works effort to employ the town's poor at spinning and weaving linen. With Doctor Thomas Young he was one of the most radical among the genteel Whig organizers who sought to steer public demonstrations in Boston after 1765. For example, on January 18, 1770, he advocated a march on acting governor Thomas Hutchinson's mansion despite warnings that such an act against the king's representative was tantamount to treason, and reportedly threatened to kill himself if his colleagues did not agree.
Molineux was the only top Whig organizer not in Old South Meeting House on the night of the Tea Party, meaning he was probably at the dock observing the destruction of the tea. In 1774 he set an example by refusing jury duty under royal judges and may have helped to gather field artillery for the province. However, in late October, he suddenly became ill, and on October 22 he died, reportedly saying, "O save my Country, Heaven."
Conflicting rumors circulated. The working-class Whigs who followed Molineux suggested he had been poisoned by British army officers. Friends of the royal government said he had committed suicide after being caught embezzling for the linen project from a New York merchant whose affairs he represented. His estate was in debt to that man, but Molineux may have died of entirely natural causes.
Because Molineux died before the American Revolutionary War began, and because some of his colleagues were uncomfortable with his radical methods, he was largely omitted in histories of America's independence. In fact, his name was preserved most prominently in a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne titled "My Kinsman, Major Molineux," set in the 1740s, in which the title character is a victim, not a leader, of a Boston crowd. Molineux's home on Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts was torn down to make room for the Massachusetts State House.
He is a featured character in the 2012 video game, Assassin's Creed III.

[[Wishart distribution]]

CATEGORIES: Continuous distributions, Multivariate continuous distributions, Multivariate statistics, Random matrices, Conjugate prior distributions, Exponential family distributions, Probability distributions

In statistics, the Wishart distribution is a generalization to multiple dimensions of the chi-squared distribution, or, in the case of non-integer degrees of freedom, of the gamma distribution. It is named in honor of John Wishart, who first formulated the distribution in 1928.[tpl]cite journal |first=J. |last=Wishart |authorlink=John Wishart (statistician) |title=The generalised product moment distribution in samples from a normal multivariate population |journal=Biometrika |volume=20A |issue=1–2 |pages=32–52 |year=1928 |doi=10.1093/biomet/20A.1-2.32 |jfm=54.0565.02 |jstor=2331939[/tpl]
It is any of a family of probability distributions defined over symmetric, nonnegative-definite matrix-valued random variables (“random matrices”). These distributions are of great importance in the estimation of covariance matrices in multivariate statistics. In Bayesian statistics, the Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior of the inverse covariance-matrix  of a multivariate-normal random-vector.

Angelina Emily Grimké Weld (February 20, 1805 – October 26, 1879) was an American political activist, abolitionist, women's rights advocate, and supporter of the women's suffrage movement. While she was raised a southerner, she spent her entire adult life living in the North. The years of her greatest fame were between 1836, when a letter she sent to William Lloyd Garrison was published in his anti-slavery newspaper, The Liberator, and May 1838, when she gave a courageous and brilliant speech to abolitionists gathered in Philadelphia, with a hostile crowd throwing stones and shouting just outside the hall. The essays and speeches she produced in that two-year period were incisive arguments to end slavery and advance women's rights.
Drawing her views from natural rights theory (famously set forth in the Declaration of Independence), the Constitution, and from Christian beliefs in the Bible, as well has her own experience of slavery and racism in the South, she argued for the injustice of denying freedom to any man or woman, and was particularly eloquent on the problem of racial prejudice. When challenged for speaking in public to mixed audiences of men and women in 1837, she, joined by her sister Sarah, fiercely defended women's right to make speeches and more generally be fully political beings.
Grimké married Theodore Weld, a prominent abolitionist himself, in May 1838. They lived in New Jersey, with her sister Sarah Grimke, and raised three children, and supported themselves by running two schools, the later located in the Raritan Bay Union utopian community. After the Civil War ended, the Grimke-Weld household moved to Hyde Park, Massachusetts, where they spent their last years. Angelina and Sarah were active in the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association in the 1870s.

Lasers is the third studio album by American rapper Lupe Fiasco, released on March 7, 2011 by Atlantic Records. Production for the album took place between 2008 and 2010. Lasers features production by The Audibles, The Neptunes, Needlz, Alex da Kid, Syience, and long-time collaborator Soundtrakk, among others. Trey Songz, John Legend, Skylar Grey, Sway, Matt Mahaffey, MDMA, Eric Turner and Sarah Green contribute vocals to the album.
Lasers was preceded by the lead single "The Show Goes On" and its follow-up "Words I Never Said" featuring Skylar Grey. The former became Fiasco's highest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 and has been certified double platinum in the US. The latter, however, only achieved moderate success on the Hot 100.
The album has received "mixed or average reviews" from most major music critics, having a score of 57 out of 100 at the review aggregator Metacritic. It fared better commercially however, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over 200,000 copies sold, making the album Fiasco's second top ten album as well as his highest entry on the chart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/chart-moves-katy-perry-rihanna-set-records-1005079122.story |title=Chart Moves: Katy Perry, Rihanna Set Records; Lupe Fiasco, Christian Music on Billboard 200 |publisher=Billboard.biz |date= |accessdate=2011-03-19[/tpl]

He held several major commands and was most famous for resurrecting the United Nations (U.N.) war effort during the Korean War. Several historians have credited Ridgway for turning the war around in favor of the UN side. His long and prestigious military career was recognized by the award of the Presidential Medal of Freedom on May 12, 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, who stated that "Heroes come when they're needed; great men step forward when courage seems in short supply."Arthur, Billy A., Obituary: General Matthew Ridgway, The Independent, 1993-08-10, retrieved 2009-08-31

Silent Movie is a 1976 satirical comedy film co-written, directed by, and starring Mel Brooks, and released by 20th Century Fox on June 17, 1976. The ensemble cast includes Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Bernadette Peters, and Sid Caesar, with appearances by Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Marcel Marceau and Paul Newman playing themselves. 
While indeed silent (except for one word and numerous sound effects), the film is a parody of the silent film genre, particularly the slapstick comedies of Charlie Chaplin, Mack Sennett, and Buster Keaton. Among the film's most famous gags is the fact that the only audible line in the movie is spoken by Marcel Marceau, a noted mime.
Sound is a big factor in the film's humor, as when a scene that shows New York City begins with the song "San Francisco", only to have it come to a sudden stop as if the musicians realize they are playing the wrong music. They then go into "I'll Take Manhattan" instead.
A play on the 1970s trend of large corporations buying up smaller companies is parodied in this film by the attempt of the Engulf and Devour Corporation to take control of a studio (a thinly veiled reference to Gulf+Western's takeover of Paramount Pictures).

The sketches were originally published in various newspapers and other periodicals between 1833 and 1836, then issued in instalments under their current title from 1837 to 1839.

(Sizes in the diagram are not meant to indicate relative sizes within a population.)]]
Positive atheism (also called strong atheism and hard atheism) is the form of atheism that asserts that no deities exist. Negative atheism (also called weak atheism and soft atheism) is any other type of atheism, wherein a person does not believe in the existence of any deities, but does not explicitly assert there to be none.
The terms negative atheism and positive atheism were used by Antony Flew in 1976, and appeared again in Michael Martin's writings in 1990.[ref]

"negative atheism, the position of not believing a theistic God exists" / "positive atheism: the position of disbelieving a theistic God exists";

Gotthelf Bergsträsser (April 5, 1886, Oberlosa, Plauen – August 16, 1933, near Berchtesgaden) was a German linguist specializing in Semitic studies, usually considered to be one of the greatest of the twentieth century. Bergsträsser was first a teacher of Classical languages and then decided to learn the Semitic languages.
He was a professor at the University of Constantinople during World War I, when he was an officer in the German army stationed in Turkey. When he was there, he studied the spoken dialects of Arabic and Aramaic in Syria and Palestine. One of his most well known works is the 29th (and final) edition of Wilhelm Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (1918–1929), which remained incomplete, containing only phonology and morphology of the verb. Also widely admired was his Introduction to the Semitic Languages (1928, English translation 1983). These brought him international fame as a scholar. His last position was professor of the Semitic languages at the University of Munich.
Bergsträsser mostly engaged in the study of Arabic, focusing on the history of the text of the Qur'an. Bergsträsser left many of his planned works unfinished (including the rest of his Hebrew grammar and his grammar of spoken Aramaic), when he disappeared while mountaineering in 1933.
Bergsträsser was an outspoken anti-Nazi, and helped to save German Jewish scholars.

Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp was a large group of German concentration camps that was built around the villages of Mauthausen and Gusen in Upper Austria, roughly [tpl]convert|20|km[/tpl] east of the city of Linz. Its history ran from the time of the Anschluss in 1938 to the beginning of May 1945.
Initially a single camp at Mauthausen, it expanded over time and by the summer of 1940, Mauthausen had become one of the largest labour camp complexes in the German-controlled part of Europe.[tpl]sfn|Dobosiewicz (2000)|pp=191-202[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bischof & Pelinka|pp=185-190[/tpl] Apart from the four main sub-camps at Mauthausen and nearby Gusen, more than 50 sub-camps, located throughout Austria and southern Germany, used the inmates as slave labour. Several subordinate camps of the KZ Mauthausen complex included quarries, munitions factories, mines, arms factories and Me 262 fighter-plane assembly plants.[tpl]sfn|Haunschmied (2008)|pp=172-175[/tpl] In January 1945, the camps, directed from the central office in Mauthausen, contained roughly 85,000 inmates.[tpl]sfn|Dobosiewicz (1977)|pp=449[/tpl] The death toll remains unknown, although most sources place it between 122,766 and 320,000 for the entire complex.
The camps formed one of the first massive concentration camp complexes in Nazi Germany, and were the last ones to be liberated by the Allies. The two main camps, Mauthausen and Gusen I, were labelled as "Grade III" (Stufe III) camps, which meant that they were intended to be the toughest camps for the "Incorrigible Political Enemies of the Reich". Mauthausen never lost this Stufe III classification. In the offices of the RSHA (Reichssicherheitshauptamt) it was referred to by the nickname Knochenmühle—the bone-grinder.[tpl]sfn|Pike|p=14[/tpl] Unlike many other concentration camps, which were intended for all categories of prisoners, Mauthausen was mostly used for extermination through labour of the intelligentsia, who were educated people and members of the higher social classes in countries subjugated by the Nazi regime during World War II.[tpl]sfn|Gębik|p=332[/tpl] The main camp of the complex in Mauthausen is now a museum, some of its sub-camps were also turned into memorials.

Sherman's March to the Sea is the name commonly given to the military Savannah Campaign  in the American Civil War, conducted through Georgia from November 15 to December 21, 1864 by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman of the Union Army. The campaign began with Sherman's troops leaving the captured city of Atlanta, Georgia, on November 15 and ended with the capture of the port of Savannah on December 21. His forces destroyed military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property and disrupted the South's economy and its transportation networks. Sherman's bold move of operating deep within enemy territory and without supply lines is considered to be revolutionary in the annals of war.Eicher, p. 768.

Symptoms include lower back pain, buttock pain, and pain, numbness or weakness in various parts of the leg and foot. Other symptoms include a "pins and needles" sensation, or tingling and difficulty moving or controlling the leg. Typically, symptoms only manifest on one side of the body. The pain may radiate below the knee, but does not always.
Sciatica is a relatively common form of low back and leg pain, but the true meaning of the term is often misunderstood. Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a diagnosis for what is irritating the root of the nerve to cause the pain. Treatment for sciatica or sciatic symptoms often differs, depending on underlying causes and pain levels. Causes include compression of the sciatic nerve roots by a herniated (torn) or protruding disc in the lower back.
The first known use of the word sciatica dates from 1451.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Ed. "a1450a Mankind (Brandl)."

[[Irish literature]]

CATEGORIES: Irish literature

Irish literature comprises writings in the Irish, Latin, Ulster Scots and English languages on the island of Ireland. For a comparatively small island, Ireland has made a disproportionately large contribution to world literature.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] The earliest recorded Irish writing dates from the seventh century and was produced by monks writing in both Latin and Early Irish. In addition to scriptural writing, the monks of Ireland recorded both poetry and mythological tales. There is a large surviving body of Irish mythological writing, including tales such as The Táin and Mad King Sweeny. During the medieval, period there was a strong Bardic culture,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] in which professional literati had high status as panegyrists, historians and poets.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The English language was introduced to Ireland in the thirteenth century, following the Norman Conquest of Ireland. The Irish language, however, remained the dominant language of Irish literature down to the nineteenth century, despite a slow decline which began in the seventeenth century with the expansion of English power. The nineteenth century saw a sudden and rapid replacement of Irish by English in the greater part of the country. At the end of the century, however, cultural nationalism displayed a new energy, marked by the Gaelic Revival (which encouraged a modern literature in Irish) and more generally by the Irish Literary Revival.
The Anglo-Irish literary tradition found its first great exponent in Jonathan Swift. Writers such as Lawrence Sterne, Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan are often claimed for Ireland, though their lives and their works were essentially English. The same can be said of Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker and C.S. Lewis, prominent writers who left Ireland to make a life in London. More recognizably "Irish" writers included Louis McNeice, George Bernard Shaw (though he spent most of his life in England) and W. B. Yeats. The descendants of Scottish settlers in Ulster formed the Ulster-Scots writing tradition, having an especially strong tradition of rhyming poetry.
Though English was the dominant Irish literary language in the twentieth century, much work of high quality appeared in Irish. A pioneering modernist writer in Irish was Pádraic Ó Conaire, and traditional life was given vigorous expression in a series of autobiographies by native Irish speakers from the west coast, exemplified by the work of Tomás Ó Criomhthain and Peig Sayers. The outstanding modernist prose writer in Irish was Máirtín Ó Cadhain, and prominent poets included Máirtín Ó Direáin, Seán Ó Ríordáin and Máire Mhac an tSaoi. Prominent bilingual writers included Brendan Behan (who wrote poetry and a play in Irish) and Flann O'Brien. Two novels by O'Brien, At Swim Two Birds and The Third Policeman, are considered early examples of postmodern fiction, but he also wrote a satirical novel in Irish called An Béal Bocht (translated as The Poor Mouth). Liam O'Flaherty, who gained fame as a writer in English, also published a book of short stories in Irish (Dúil).
Most attention has been given to Irish writers who wrote in English and who were at the forefront of the modernist movement, notably James Joyce, whose novel Ulysses is considered one of the most influential of the century. The playwright Samuel Beckett, in addition to a large amount of prose fiction, wrote a number of important plays, including Waiting for Godot. Several Irish writers have excelled at short story writing, in particular Frank O’Connor and William Trevor. In the late twentieth century Irish poets, especially those from Northern Ireland, came to prominence with Derek Mahon, John Montague, Seamus Heaney and Paul Muldoon. Other notable Irish writers from the twentieth century include, poet Patrick Kavanagh, dramatists Tom Murphy and Brian Friel and novelists Edna O'Brien and John McGahern.
Well-known Irish writers in English in the twenty-first century include Colum McCann, Anne Enright, Roddy Doyle, Sebastian Barry, Colm Toibín and John Banville, all of whom have all won major awards. Younger writers include Kevin Barry, Emma Donoghue, Donal Ryan and dramatist Martin McDonagh. Writing in Irish has also continued to flourish.
A total of four Irish writers have won the Nobel Prize for Literature – W.B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney. Modern literature in Irish continues to be vigorous.

[[Lab color space]]
CATEGORIES: Color space

A Lab'' color space''' is a color-opponent space with dimension L for lightness and a and b' for the color-opponent dimensions, based on nonlinearly compressed CIE XYZ color space coordinates.
The dimensions of the Hunter 1948 ''L'', ''a'', ''b'' color space are L, a, and b.[tpl]cite journal|title=Photoelectric Color-Difference    Meter|first=Richard Sewall|last=Hunter|journal=JOSA|volume=38|issue=7|pages=661|date=July 1948| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-38-7-651[/tpl] (Proceedings of the Winter Meeting of the Optical Society of America)[tpl]cite journal|title= Accuracy, Precision, and Stability of New Photo-electric Color-Difference Meter|first=Richard Sewall|last=Hunter|journal=JOSA|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1094|date=December 1948| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-38-12-1092[/tpl] (Proceedings of the Thirty-Third Annual Meeting of the Optical Society of America) However, Lab is now more often used as an informal abbreviation for the CIE 1976 (''L*'', ''a*'', ''b*'') color space (or CIELAB). The difference between Hunter and CIE color coordinates is that the CIE coordinates are based on a cube root transformation of the color data, while the Hunter coordinates are based on a square root transformation.
Both spaces are derived from the "master" space CIE 1931 XYZ color space, which can predict which spectral power distributions will be perceived as the same color (see metamerism), but which is not particularly perceptually uniform.A discussion and proposed improvement, Bruce Lindbloom  Strongly influenced by the Munsell color system, the intention of both "Lab" color spaces is to create a space that can be computed via simple formulas from the XYZ space but is more perceptually uniform than XYZ.Explanation of this history, Bruce MacEvoy Perceptually uniform means that a change of the same amount in a color value should produce a change of about the same visual importance. When storing colors in limited precision values, this can improve the reproduction of tones.  Both Lab spaces are relative to the white point of the XYZ data they were converted from.  Lab values do not define absolute colors unless the white point is also specified.  Often, in practice, the white point is assumed to follow a standard and is not explicitly stated (e.g., for "absolute colorimetric" rendering intent ICC L*a*b* values are relative to CIE standard illuminant D50, while they are relative to the unprinted substrate for other rendering intents).
The lightness correlate in CIELAB is calculated using the cube root of the relative luminance.
The L*a*b* color space includes all perceivable colors, which means that its gamut exceeds those of the RGB and CMYK color models  (for example, ProPhoto RGB includes about 90% all perceivable colors). One of the most important attributes of the L*a*b*-model is device independence. This means that the colors are defined independent of their nature of creation or the device they are displayed on.  The L*a*b* color space is used when graphics for print have to be converted from RGB to CMYK, as the L*a*b* gamut includes both the RGB and CMYK gamut. Also it is used as an interchange format between different devices as for its device independency.

CATEGORIES: 2003 novels, Transhumanist books, Novels by Charles Stross, Postcyberpunk novels, British science fiction novels, 2000s science fiction novels, Libertarian science fiction, Anarchist fiction, Ace Books books

Singularity Sky is a science fiction novel by author Charles Stross, published in 2003. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2004. A sequel, Iron Sunrise, was published that same year. Together the two are referred to as the Eschaton novels, after a near-godlike intelligence that exists in both.
The novel follows the ill-fated military campaign by a repressive state, the New Republic, to retaliate for a perceived invasion of one of its colony worlds. In actuality, the planet has been visited by the Festival, a technologically advanced alien race that rewards its hosts for "entertaining" them by granting whatever the entertainer wishes, including the Festival's own technology. This causes extensive social, economic and political disruption to the colony, which was generally limited by the New Republic to technology equivalent to that found on Earth during the Industrial Revolution. Aboard the New Republic's flagship, an engineer and intelligence operative from Earth covertly attempt to prevent the use of a forbidden technology—and fall in love along the way.
Themes of the novel include transhumanism (the impact of a sudden technological singularity on a repressive society) and the need for information to be free, which inspired a proposal to give every Afghan a free mobile phone to combat the Taliban.[tpl]cite web|last=Betz|first=David|title=Fresh from the Department of Crazy Ideas: Phonebomb Afghanistan|url=http://kingsofwar.org.uk/2010/10/fresh-from-the-department-of-crazy-ideas-phonebomb-afghanistan/|publisher=King's College, London|date=7 October 2010|accessdate=17 January 2013[/tpl] Its narrative encompasses space opera and elements of steampunk[tpl]cite book|last=Elhefnawy|first=Nader|title=After the New Wave: Science Fiction Since 1980|year=2011|publisher=Nader Elhefnawy|isbn=9781463644826|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ztyLjzdvB6UC&oi=fnd&pg=PA17|accessdate=18 January 2013|page=17[/tpl] and science fantasy. Intertwined within are social and political satire, and Stross's trademark dark humour and subtle literary and cultural allusions.
Stross wrote the novel during the late 1990s, his first attempt at the form. It was not his first novel to be published, but it was the first to be originally published in book form. Its original title, Festival of Fools, was changed to avoid confusion with Richard Paul Russo's Ship of Fools.

[[Titles of Nobility Amendment]]

CATEGORIES: United States nationality law, Unratified amendments to the United States Constitution

The Titles of Nobility Amendment (TONA) was proposed as an amendment to the United States Constitution by the 11th Congress in 1810. The amendment would strip United States citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility from a foreign country. 
TONA was ratified by 12 state legislatures, and on two occasions between 1812 and 1816 was within two states of the required three-quarters, though it never reached that threshold and thus is not part of the Constitution.  Because Congress did not impose a time limit for ratification, TONA technically could still become part of the Constitution if it were ratified by an additional 26 states.

[[Duke of Silesia]]

CATEGORIES: Dukes of Silesia, History of Silesia

The Duke of Silesia was the sons and descendants of the Polish Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth.  In accordance with the last will and testament of Bolesław, upon his death his lands were divided into four or five hereditary provinces distributed among his sons, and a royal province of Kraków reserved for the eldest, who was to be High Duke of all Poland. This was known as the fragmentation of Poland. Subsequent developments lead to further splintering of the duchies.
At the beginning of the 14th century, fourteen independent Duchies existed in Silesia: Brzeg, Wrocław, Świdnica, Jawor, Ziębice, Głogów, Ścinawa, Żagan and Oleśnica in Lower Silesia; Koźle, Cieszyn, Bytom, Niemodlin, Opole, Strzelce, Racibórz and Opava in Upper Silesia and the eclessiatical duchy of Nysa. Between 1327 and 1329 most dukes accepted the overlordship of Bohemian king John of Bohemia, who acquired the right of succession for all of these duchies. In the coming centuries all branches of the Silesian Piasts died out, and with the death of George William, Duke of Liegnitz the dynasty ceased to exist.

USS ''Hancock'' (CV/CVA-19) was one of 24 [tpl]Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier[/tpl]s built during World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for John Hancock, president of the Second Continental Congress and first governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.There is some controversy regarding the naming of fleet carriers after famous Americans.

The other examples are the [tpl]USS|Franklin|CV-13|2[/tpl] was named for Benjamin Franklin, and was the fifth ship to bear the name, and the [tpl]USS|Randolph|CV-15|2[/tpl] was named for Peyton Randolph, President of the First Continental Congress. Hancock was commissioned in April 1944, and served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning four battle stars. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA). In her second career she operated exclusively in the Pacific, playing a prominent role  in the Vietnam War, for which she earned a Navy Unit Commendation. She was the first US Navy carrier to have steam catapults installed.
She was decommissioned in early 1976, and sold for scrap later that year.

The Hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothraustes) is a passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. Its closest living relatives are the Evening Grosbeak (C. vespertinus) from North America and the Hooded Grosbeak (C. abeillei) from Central America especially Mexico.
This bird breeds across  Europe and temperate Asia. It is mainly resident in Europe, but many Asian birds migrate further south in the winter. It is a rare vagrant to the western islands of Alaska.
Deciduous or mixed woodland, including parkland, with large trees - especially Hornbeam - is favoured for breeding,. The Hawfinch builds its nest in a bush or tree, and lays 2-7 eggs. The food is mainly seeds and fruit kernels, especially those of cherries, which it cracks with its powerful bill. This large finch species is usually seen in a pair or small group.
The 16.5–18 cm long Hawfinch is a bulky bull-headed bird, which appears very short-tailed in flight. Its head is orange-brown with a black eyestripe and bib, and a massive bill, which is black in summer but paler in winter. The upper parts are dark brown and the underparts orange.
The white wing bars and tail tip are striking in flight. The sexes are similar. The call is a hard chick. The song of this unobtrusive bird is quiet and mumbled.

[[Combat air patrol]]
CATEGORIES: Aerial warfare tactics, Military terminology

Combat air patrol (CAP) is a type of flying mission for fighter aircraft.
A combat air patrol is an aircraft patrol provided over an objective area, over the force protected, over the critical area of a combat zone, or over an air defense area, for the purpose of intercepting and destroying hostile aircraft before they reach their target. Combat air patrols apply to both overland and overwater operations, protecting other aircraft, fixed and mobile sites on land, or ships at sea.
Known by the acronym CAP, it typically entails fighters flying a tactical pattern around or screening a defended target, while looking for incoming attackers. Effective CAP patterns may include aircraft positioned at both high and low altitudes, in order to shorten response times when an attack is detected. Modern CAPs are either GCI or AWACS-controlled to provide maximum early warning for defensive reaction.
The first CAPs were characteristic of aircraft carrier operations, where CAPs were flown to protect a carrier battle group, but the term has become generic to both Air Force and Navy flight operations. Capping operations differ from fighter escorts in that the CAP force is not tied to the group it is protecting, is not limited in altitudes and speeds it flies, and has tactical flexibility to engage a threat. Fighter escorts typically stay with the asset they are supporting and at the speed of the supported group, as a final reactive force against a close threat. When an escort engages, the supported force is left unprotected.

[[Parasitic drag]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid dynamics, Aerodynamics

Parasitic drag is drag that results when an object is moved through a fluid medium (in the case of aerodynamics, a gaseous medium, more specifically, the atmosphere). Parasitic drag is a combination of form drag, skin friction and interference drag. Induced drag and wave drag are separate components of total drag, and are NOT components of parasitic drag.
In flight, induced drag results from the need to maintain lift. It is greater at lower speeds where a high angle of attack is required. As speed increases, the induced drag decreases, but parasitic drag increases because the fluid is striking the object with greater force, and is moving across the object's surfaces at higher speed. As speed continues to increase into the transonic and supersonic regimes, wave drag enters the picture. Each of these drag components changes in proportion to the others based on speed. The combined overall drag curve therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed; an aircraft flying at this speed will be close to its optimal efficiency. Pilots will use this speed to maximize the gliding range in case of an engine failure. However, to maximize the gliding endurance, the aircraft's speed would have to be at the point of minimum power, which occurs at lower speeds than minimum drag.
At the point of minimum drag, CD,o (drag coefficient of aircraft when lift equals zero) is equal to CD,i (induced drag coefficient, or coefficient of drag created by lift). At the point of minimum power, CD,o is equal to one third times CD,i. This can be proven by deriving the following equations:

[[Pressure altitude]]

CATEGORIES: Altitudes in aviation

Pressure altitude within the atmosphere is the altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere with the same pressure as the part of the atmosphere in question.
In aviation, pressure altitude is the indicated altitude when an altimeter is set to an agreed baseline pressure setting under certain circumstances where the aircraft's altimeter would be unable to give a useful read out of altitude. Examples would be landing at a very high altitude or near sea level in conditions of exceptionally high air pressure. Old altimeters were typically limited to show altitude when set between 950mbs and 1030mbs. "Standard" pressure, the baseline used universally is 1013.25hPa, equivalent to 1013.25millibars(mbs), or 29.92" of mercury. This setting is equivalent to the air pressure at mean sea level (MSL) in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). Pressure altitude is primarily used in aircraft performance calculations and in high-altitude flight (above the transition altitude).  The term "QNE" refers to the indicated altitude at the landing runway threshold when 1013.2mb/29.92 inHg is set in the altimeter's Kollsman window and not the setting itself, as is commonly misconceived.
Most aviation texts for PPL and CPL exams describe a process of finding pressure altitude using the following formula 
Pressure Altitude(PA) = Hgt + 1000(29.92-altimeter setting)
For example if the airfield height is 500 feet and the altimeter setting is 29.32"Hg then
PA= 500 + 1000(29.92-29.32)
  = 500 + 1000 x 0.6
  = 500 + 600
  = 1100 feet
Alternatively, Pressure Altitude(PA) = Hgt + 30(1013-QNH)
For example if the airfield height is 500 feet and the QNH is 993 Mb then
PA= 500 + 30(1013-993)
  = 500 + 30 x 20
  = 500 + 600
  = 1100 feet
Aircraft transponders report the pressure altitude; corrections for atmospheric pressure variations are applied on the ground.
The relationship between static pressure and pressure altitude is defined in terms of the properties of the International Standard Atmosphere.

As Li Tai was clearly younger and born of the same mother as Li Chengqian, the dates cannot be both correct, but it is not clear which, if either, date was correct.

He was Emperor Taizong's oldest son and first crown prince, but was replaced later by his younger brother Li Zhi (the eventual Emperor Gaozong).
Li Chengqian was created crown prince in 627 at the age of eight, after his father became emperor in 626. In his youth, he had a reputation for good judgment, but was also said to be suffering from a foot illness. Later on, he was said to be frivolous, favoring Tujue customs instead of studying about ways to rule an empire. He lost favor in Emperor Taizong's eyes to a younger brother, Li Tai the Prince of Wei.  (Both were born of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun.)  In 643, in fear that Emperor Taizong was about to depose him in favor of Li Tai, he plotted with the general Hou Junji to overthrow Emperor Taizong. The plot was discovered, and he was deposed and reduced to commoner rank, but Emperor Taizong, believing that Li Tai to be responsible for Li Chengqian's downfall, created yet another son, Li Zhi (also by Empress Zhangsun), crown prince instead. Li Chengqian was exiled, and died in exile in 644, as a commoner under house arrest. He was posthumously granted an imperial prince title during the reign of his grandnephew, Emperor Xuanzong after his grandson Li Shizhi became chancellor.

Li Tai, who carried the title of Prince of Wei, was favored by his father, Emperor Taizong, for his literary talent and studiousness.  His older brother Li Chengqian was crown prince, but Li Tai and his associates had design on that position, eventually pushing Li Chengqian to plot treason in 643.  After Li Chengqian's plot was discovered, Li Chengqian was deposed, and Emperor Taizong agreed to create Li Tai the new crown prince.  However, Emperor Taizong soon saw that Li Tai had pushed Li Chengqian toward rebellion by machination and further appeared to bear ill intentions toward their younger brother Li Zhi the Prince of Jin, and so Emperor Taizong created Li Zhi crown prince instead.

It was the first spaceflight to send animals into orbit and return them safely back to Earth. Launched on August 19, 1960 it paved the way for the first human orbital flight, Vostok 1, which was launched less than eight months later.
Korabl-Sputnik 2 was the second attempt to launch a Vostok capsule with dogs on board as the first try on July 28 had been unsuccessful after the Blok G strap-on suffered a fire and breakdown in one of the combustion chambers, followed by its breaking off of the booster 19 seconds after launch. The launch vehicle then disintegrated, the rest of the strap-ons separating and flying in random directions with the Blok I core stage continuing on its trajectory until Range Safety issued the destruct command at T+28 seconds.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] The Vostok descent module was blasted free of the exploding booster, but the dogs were killed upon impact with the ground. It was believed that the combustion chamber disintegration was due to longitudinal vibrations. This created a considerable uproar as this problem (which had plagued earlier 8K72 launches) had supposedly been corrected.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The launch of Korabl-Sputnik 2 occurred on 19 August 1960, using a Vostok-L carrier rocket. Official sources reported the launch time to have been 08:44:06 UTC, however Sergei Voevodin gave it as 08:38:24.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] A radio station in Bonn, West Germany, was among the first to pick up signals from the spacecraft, which were confirmed on the third orbit by a Swedish radio station.
The spacecraft carried two dogs, Belka and Strelka, 40 mice, two rats and a variety of plants, as well as a television camera which took images of the dogs. The spacecraft returned to Earth at 06:00:00 UTC on 20 August, the day after its launch, although telemetry revealed that one dog had suffered seizures during the fourth orbit. Thus, it was decided to limit the first manned flight to three orbits. All of the animals were recovered safely, and a year later Strelka had a litter of puppies, one of which was sent to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy as a goodwill present from the Soviet Union. President Kennedy's advisers initially opposed taking the dog for fear that the Soviets might have planted microphones in its body to listen in on national defense meetings.

[tpl]About|the automobile|the motorcycle of the same name|Triumph TR6 Trophy[tpl]![/tpl]Triumph TR6 Trophy[/tpl]

The Triumph TR6 (1969–76) is a British six-cylinder sports car and the best-seller of the TR range built by Triumph when production ended in July 1976. This record was then surpassed by the TR7. Of the 94,619 TR6s produced, 86,249 were exported; only 8,370 were sold in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vtr.org/TR6/TR6-history.shtml|title=A History of the TR6 |accessdate=2010-10-11|author=vtr.org[/tpl]
The bodywork closely resembled that of the previous model, the Triumph TR5, but the front and back ends were squared off, reportedly based on a consultancy contract involving Karmann. This is referred to as a Kamm tail, which was very common during 1970s era of cars and a feature on most Triumphs. The body shape was similar to the TR4/TR5 except for the rear and front.[tpl]cite journal | authorlink = |title = Autotest: Triumph TR6 PI | series = 130| journal = Autocar | volume =(nbr3818) | pages =pages 2–6 "... so Karmann Ghia were consulted for a quick rejuvenating process, and the result is a kind of smoothed out TR with fashionable and effective use of matte black for the radiator grill and undercut tail panel".| date = 17 April 1969[/tpl]
All TR6 sports cars featured inline six-cylinder engines. For the US market the engine was carburetted, as had been the US-only TR250 engine. Like the TR5, the TR6 was fuel-injected for other world markets including the United Kingdom, hence the TR6PI (petrol-injection) designation. The Lucas mechanical fuel injection system helped the home-market TR6 produce [tpl]convert|150|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] (145 hp DIN) at model introduction. Later the non-US TR6 variant was detuned to [tpl]convert|125|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] in order for it to be easier to drive,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] while the US variant continued to be carburetted with a mere (but more reliable[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]) [tpl]convert|104|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
The TR6 featured a four-speed manual transmission. An optional overdrive unit was a desirable feature because it gave drivers close gearing for aggressive driving with an electrically switched overdrive which could operate on 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears on early models and 3rd and 4th on later models because of constant gearbox failures in 2nd at high revs. Both provided "long legs" for open motorways. TR6 also featured semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering, [tpl]convert|15|in|adj=on[/tpl] wheels and tires, pile carpet on floors and trunk/boot, bucket seats, and a full complement of instrumentation. Braking was accomplished by disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear.  A factory steel hardtop was optional, requiring two people to fit it. TR6 construction was fundamentally old-fashioned: the body was bolted onto a frame instead of the two being integrated into a unibody structure; the TR6 dashboard was wooden (plywood w/ veneer). Other factory options included a rear anti-roll bar and a limited slip differential.
The UK version TR6PI could accelerate from zero to [tpl]convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in 8.2 seconds and had a top speed of [tpl]convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] according to Autocar magazine.Autocar, full road test 1969
As of Q1 2011 there were approximately 2723 licensed and 1320 SORN TR6s registered with the DVLA in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.howmanyleft.co.uk/vehicle/triumph_tr6 |title=How Many Left web site |publisher=www.howmanyleft.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/vehicles/licensing/ |title=Vehicle licensing statistics |publisher=Department of Transport |date= |accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl]
Some say that the car is one of Leyland's best achievements, but there were and remain a number of issues because of poor design. These issues include a low level radiator top-up bottle and a poor hand-brake. As is the case with other cars of the era, the TR6 can suffer from rust issues, although surviving examples tend to be well-cared for.  The TR6 can be prone to overheating. Many owners fit an aftermarket electric radiator fan to supplement or replace the original engine-driven fan. There is also the Leyland factory option of an oil cooler. Parts and services to support ownership of a TR6 are readily available and there are a number of classic car owners' clubs that cater for the model.

Welsh rarebit or Welsh rabbithttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/welsh%20rabbithttp://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Welsh-rarebit is a dish made with a savoury sauce of melted cheese and various other ingredients and served hot, after being poured over slices (or other pieces) of toasted bread,Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press, 2006, ISBN 0-7862-8517-6 or the hot cheese sauce may be served in a chafing dish like a fondue, accompanied by sliced, toasted bread. The names of the dish originate from 18th-century Great Britain.
Welsh rarebit is typically made with Cheddar cheese, in contrast to the Continental European fondue which classically depends on Swiss cheeses.
Various recipes for Welsh rarebit include the addition of ale, mustard, ground cayenne pepper or ground paprikaLe Guide Culinaire by Georges Auguste Escoffier, translated by H. L. Cracknell and R. J.

Acknowledging that there is more than one way to make a rarebit, some cookbooks have included two recipes: the Boston Cooking-School Cook Book of 1896 provides one béchamel-based recipe and another with beer, Le Guide Culinaire of 1907 has one with ale and one without, and the Constance Spry Cookery Book of 1956 has one with flour and one without.

The American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), sometimes colloquially known as the Sparrow Hawk, is a small falcon, and the only kestrel found in the Americas. It is the most common falcon in North America, and is found in a wide variety of habitats. At [tpl]convert|19|-|21|cm|in|0|sp=us|abbr = on[/tpl] long, it is also the smallest falcon in North America. It exhibits sexual dimorphism in size and plumage, although both sexes have a rufous back with noticeable barring. Juveniles are similar in plumage to adults.
The American Kestrel hunts by hovering in the air with rapid wing beats or perching and scanning the ground for prey. Its diet typically consists of grasshoppers, lizards, mice, and small birds. It nests in cavities in trees, cliffs, buildings, and other structures. The female lays three to seven eggs, which both sexes help to incubate. It is a common bird to be used in falconry, especially by beginners.
Its breeding range extends from central and western Alaska across northern Canada to Nova Scotia, and south throughout North America, into central Mexico and the Caribbean. It is a local breeder in Central America and is widely distributed throughout South America. Most birds breeding in Canada and the northern United States migrate south in the winter. It is an occasional vagrant to western Europe.

The Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) is a bird of prey, one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the "chickenhawk," though it rarely preys on standard sized chickens.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/lifehistory |title=Red-tailed Hawk |work=All About Birds |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=16 May 2011[/tpl] It breeds throughout most of North America, from western Alaska and northern Canada to as far south as Panama and the West Indies, and is one of the most common buteos in North America. Red-tailed Hawks can acclimate to all the biomes within their range. There are fourteen recognized subspecies, which vary in appearance and range. It is one of the largest members of the genus Buteo in North America, typically weighing from [tpl]Convert|690|to|1600|g|lbs|abbr = on[/tpl] and measuring [tpl]Convert|45|-|65|cm|abbr = on[/tpl] in length, with a wingspan from [tpl]Convert|110|-|145|cm|abbr = on[/tpl]. The Red-tailed Hawk displays sexual dimorphism in size, with females averaging about 25% heavier than males.[tpl]cite web |url=http://eol.org/pages/1049057/details |title=Red-tailed Hawk |work=Encyclopedia of Life |accessdate=21 March 2012[/tpl]
The Harlan's Hawk (B. j. harlani), often considered a separate species, is treated below in the Taxonomy section.
The Red-tailed Hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes, including deserts, grasslands, coniferous and deciduous forests, tropical rainforests, agricultural fields and urban areas. It lives throughout the North American continent, except in areas of unbroken forest or the high arctic. It is legally protected in Canada, Mexico and the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Because they are so common and easily trained as capable hunters, the majority of hawks captured for falconry in the United States are Red-tails. Falconers are permitted to take only passage hawks (which have left the nest, are on their own, but are less than a year old) so as to not affect the breeding population. Adults, which may be breeding or rearing chicks, may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so. Passage red-tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these younger birds have not yet developed adult behaviors, which will make training substantially more challenging.

Austin Clarke (May 9, 1896–March 19, 1974) was one of the leading Irish poets of the generation after W. B. Yeats. He also wrote plays, novels and memoirs. Clarke's main contribution to Irish poetry was the rigour with which he used technical means borrowed from classical Irish language poetry when writing in English.
Effectively, this meant writing English verse based not so much on metre as on complex patterns of assonance, consonance, and half rhyme. Describing his technique to Robert Frost, Clarke said "I load myself down with chains and try to wriggle free."

[[Pilot-induced oscillation]]

CATEGORIES: Aviation risks

Pilot-induced oscillations, as defined by MIL-HDBK-1797A,DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INTERFACE STANDARD, Flying qualities of piloted airplanes, Washington, D.C. are sustained or uncontrollable oscillations resulting from efforts of the pilot to control the aircraft and  occurs when the pilot of an aircraft inadvertently commands an often increasing series of corrections in opposite directions, each an attempt to cover the aircraft's reaction to the previous input with an overcorrection in the opposite direction. An aircraft in such a condition can appear to be "porpoising" switching between upward and downward directions. As such it is a coupling of the frequency of the pilot's inputs and the aircraft's own frequency. During flight test, pilot-induced oscillation is one of the handling qualities factors that is analyzed, with the aircraft being graded by an established scale (chart at right). In order to avoid any assumption that oscillation is necessarily the fault of the pilot, new terms have been suggested to replace pilot-induced oscillation. These include aircraft-pilot coupling, pilot–in-the-loop oscillations and pilot-assisted (or augmented) oscillations.Witte, Joel B, An Investigation Relating Longitudinal Pilot-Induced Oscillation Tendency Rating To Describing Function Predictions For Rate-Limited Actuators https://research.maxwell.af.mil/papers/ay2004/afit/AFIT-GAE-ENY-04-M16.pdf 
In a controls sense, the oscillation is the result of reduced phase margin induced by the lag of the pilot's response. The problem has been mitigated in some cases by adding lead to the instruments - for example, cause the climb rate indication to not only reflect the current climb rate, but also be sensitive to the rate of change of the climb rate. 
The physics of flight make such oscillations more probable for pilots than for automobile drivers. An attempt to cause the aircraft to climb, say, by applying up-elevator, will also result in a reduction in airspeed.
Another factor is the response rate of flight instruments in comparison to the response rate of the aircraft itself. An increase in power will not result in an immediate increase in airspeed. An increase in climb rate will not show up immediately on the vertical speed indicator.
A pilot aiming for a 500 foot per minute descent, for example, may find himself descending too rapidly. He begins to apply up elevator until the vertical speed indicator shows 500 feet per minute. However, because the vertical speed indicator lags the actual vertical speed, the pilot is actually descending at much less than 500 feet per minute. The pilot then begins applying down elevator until the vertical speed indicator reads 500 feet per minute, starting the cycle over. It's harder than it might seem to stabilize the vertical speed because the airspeed also constantly changes.
Pilot-induced oscillations may be the fault of the aircraft, the pilot, or both. It is a common problem for inexperienced pilots, and especially student pilots; albeit, it was also a problem for the top research test pilots on the NASA lifting body program. The problem is most acute when the wing and tail section are close together in so called "short coupled" aircraft.  
The most dangerous pilot-induced oscillations can occur during landing. Too much up elevator during the flare can result in the plane getting dangerously slow and threatening to stall. A natural reaction to this is to push the nose down harder than one pulled it up, but then the pilot ends up staring at the ground. An even larger amount of up elevator starts the cycle over again.
While Pilot-Induced oscillations often start with fairly low amplitudes, which can adequately be treated with small perturbation linear theory, several PIO's will by definition become very large.[tpl]cite web|last=McRuer|first=Duane T.|title=Pilot-Induced Oscillations and Human Dynamic Behavior|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19960020960|work=NASA|publisher=Dryden Space Flight Research Center|accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] 
In February 1989 a JAS 39 Gripen prototype crashed when landing in Linköping, Sweden. Pilot-induced oscillation as a result of an over-sensitive, yet slow-response steering system was determined to be the cause. Subsequently, the steering system was redesigned.
Pilot-induced oscillation was blamed for the 1992 crash of the prototype F-22 Raptor, landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.  This crash was linked to actuator rate limiting, causing the pilot, Tom Morgenfeld, to overcompensate for pitch fluctuations.

[[Gondokoro]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Central Equatoria

 
Gondokoro was a trading-station on the east bank of the White Nile in Southern Sudan, 750 miles south of Khartoum. Its importance lay in the fact that it was within a few miles of the limit of navigability of the Nile from Khartoum upstream. From this point the journey south to Uganda was continued overland.
The Austrian Catholic missionary Ignatius Knoblecher set up a mission there in 1852.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Ignatius Knoblecher[/tpl] It was abandoned in 1859.  Gondokoro was the scene for the arrival of John Hanning Speke and James Augustus Grant after their two years and five months long journey through Central Africa from Zanzibar. They arrived exhausted on February 13, 1863 and expected to be met by the British consul John Petherick and his rescue party. As Petherick was away, hunting in the countryside the two explorers instead were welcomed by Samuel Baker and his wife Florence, who greeted them with a cup of tea.To The Heart Of The Nile: Lady Florence Baker and the Exploration of Central Africa, by Pat Shipman
A passage from Alan Moorehead´s The White Nile (p. 61) describes it thus: "The sportsman Samuel Baker and his wife had come up the Nile to look for them, and there had been others as well who had arrived at Gondokoro on the same mission, three Dutch ladies, the Baroness van Capellan and Mrs and Miss Tinne, but they had been forced to return to Khartoum through sickness. ... 
'Speke', Baker says, 'appeared the more worn of the two: he was excessively lean, but in reality he was in good tough condition; he had walked the whole way from Zanzibar, never having once ridden during that wearying march. Grant was in honourable rags; his bare knees projecting through the remnants of trousers that were an exhibition of rough industry tailor's work.'"
The site of Gondokoro is near to the modern-day city of Juba. [tpl]Coord|4|49|30.61|N|31|36|38.94|E|[/tpl]  Other neighboring famous historical places are: Lado and Rejaf (Rageef).

Concerned by abusive posts emanating from certain anonymous-posting sites, Depew developed ARMM to allow news administrators to automatically issue cancel messages for such posts. This was a controversial act, as many news administrators and users were concerned about censorship of the netnews medium.
An early version of ARMM contained a bug which caused it to post follow-ups to its own messages, recursively sending posts to the news.admin.policy newsgroup.

[[Elevator paradox]]

CATEGORIES: Paradoxes, Elevators

The elevator paradox is a paradox first noted by Marvin Stern and George Gamow, physicists who had offices on different floors of a multi-story building.  Gamow, who had an office near the bottom of the building noticed that the first elevator to stop at his floor was most often going down, while Stern, who had an office near the top, noticed that the first elevator to stop at his floor was most often going up.
At first sight, this created the impression that perhaps elevator cars were being manufactured in the middle of the building and sent upwards to the roof and downwards to the basement to be dismantled. Clearly this was not the case. But how could the observation be explained?

In the Latter Day Saint movement, priesthood is the power and authority of God given to man, including the authority to perform ordinances and to act as a leader in the church. A body of priesthood holders is referred to as a quorum.
Priesthood denotes elements of both power and authority. The priesthood includes the power Jesus gave his apostles to perform miracles such as the casting out of devils and the healing of sick (Luke 9:1). Latter Day Saints believe that the Biblical miracles performed by prophets and apostles were performed by the power of priesthood, including the miracles of Jesus, who holds all of the keys of the priesthood. The priesthood is formally known as the Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God, but to avoid the too frequent use of the name of the Son of God, the priesthood is referred to as the Melchizedek Priesthood, Melchizedek being the high priest to whom Abraham paid tithes.
As an authority, priesthood is the authority by which a bearer may perform ecclesiastical acts  of service in the name of God. Latter Day Saints believe that acts (and in particular, ordinances) performed by one with priesthood authority are recognized by God and are binding in heaven, on earth, and in the afterlife. In addition, Latter Day Saints believe that leadership positions within the church are legitimized by the priesthood authority.
For most of the history of the Latter Day Saint movement, only men have been ordained to specific offices in the Priesthood. The first exception to this policy was within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), a minor faction founded by James J. Strang that flourished between 1844 and 1856 (though a diminutive remnant still exists today).  In Strang's church, women were—and still are—permitted to hold the offices of Priest and Teacher (but not any other offices) from as early as 1856.Strang, James J. (1856) Book of the Law of the Lord, Being a Translation From the Egyptian of the Law Given to Moses in Sinai. St. James: Royal Press, pp. 199, 227.  In 1984, the Community of Christ, the second largest denomination of the movement, began ordaining women to all of its priesthood offices.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest church in the movement, still restricts its priesthood to men, as do most of the other Latter Day Saint denominations. However, an apostle of the LDS Church has taught that "men have no greater claim than women upon the blessings that issue from the Priesthood and accompany its possession."John A. Widtsoe, Priesthood and Church Government in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1939) p. 83.

[[Ashburnham Pentateuch]]
CATEGORIES: 7th-century biblical manuscripts, Bible versions and translations, Illuminated biblical manuscripts, Bibliothèque nationale de France collections

The Ashburnham Pentateuch (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS nouv. acq. lat. 2334, also known as the Tours Pentateuch) is a late 6th- or early 7th-century Latin illuminated manuscript of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament). Although it originally contained all five books of the Pentateuch, it is now missing the whole of Deuteronomy as well as sections of the other five books.
It has 142 folios and 19 miniatures, and measures 372mm by 321mm. It is thought to have originally included as many as 68 full page miniatures. A full page table containing the Latin names of the books and Latin transliterations of the Hebrew names serves as a front piece to Genesis. The table is enclosed within a curtained arch. Some of the full page miniatures, such as that containing the miniature of Noah's Ark (folio 9r), contain a single scene. Other full page miniatures, such as that telling the story of Cain and Abel (see illustration), contain many scenes which are placed in a register, with each scene having a different color background.
The origin of this manuscript is uncertain. Although it has been described by some scholars as Spanish, it may have come from North Africa, Syria or Italy.
The miniatures were used as the source of a later cycle of wall-paintings at the church of St Julian in Tours.  The manuscript was at the Library of Tours before being stolen in 1842 by Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja and sold to Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham in 1847. Since 1888, it has been housed at the National Library of France in Paris after its restitution by the heirs of Lord Ashburnham.

"Shine On You Crazy Diamond" is a nine-part Pink Floyd composition written by Roger Waters, Richard Wright and David Gilmour. It is a tribute to former band member Syd Barrett. The song was first performed on their 1974 French tour, and recorded for their 1975 concept album Wish You Were Here. The song series was intended to be a side-long composition (like "Atom Heart Mother" and "Echoes"), but was ultimately split into two sections and used to bookend the album, with new material composed that was more relevant to this epic, and to the situation in which the band found themselves."A Rambling Conversation with Roger Waters concerning All this and that - Interviewed by Nick Sedgewick", October 1975

Victory over Japan Day (also known as Victory in the Pacific Day, V-J Day, or V-P Day) is a name chosen for the day on which Japan surrendered, in effect ending World War II, and subsequent anniversaries of that event. The term has been applied to both of the days on which the initial announcement of Japan’s surrender was made—to the afternoon of August 15, 1945, in Japan, and, because of time zone differences, to August 14, 1945 (when it was announced in the United States and the rest of the Americas and Eastern Pacific Islands)—as well as to September 2, 1945, when the signing of the surrender document occurred, officially ending World War II.
August 15 is the official V-J Day for the UK, while the official U.S. commemoration is September 2.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/vj-day | title = History.com | accessdate = 2010-08-14[/tpl] The name, V-J Day, had been selected by the Allies after they named V-E Day for the victory in Europe.
On September 2, 1945, a formal surrender ceremony was performed in Tokyo Bay, Japan, aboard the battleship USS Missouri. In Japan, August 15 usually is known as the [tpl]nihongo|“memorial day for the end of the war”|終戦記念日|Shūsen-kinenbi[/tpl]; the official name for the day, however, is [tpl]nihongo|"the day for mourning of war dead and praying for peace"|戦歿者を追悼し平和を祈念する日|Senbotsusha wo tsuitōshi heiwa wo kinensuru hi[/tpl]. This official name was adopted in 1982 by an ordinance issued by the Japanese government.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/2007/08/h0808-1.html |title=厚生労働省：全国戦没者追悼式について |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-02-16 |date=2007-08-08 |publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare[/tpl]

The name refers to two central subtheories of the theory: government, which is an abstract syntactic relation, and binding, which deals with the referents of  pronouns, anaphors, and referential expressions. GB was the first theory to be based on the principles and parameters model of language, which also underlies the later developments of the Minimalist Program.

[[Butt rot]]
CATEGORIES: Plant pathogens and diseases, Tree diseases

Butt rot is a disease of plants, mostly trees, caused by fungi.  The fungus attacks the moist, poorly protected undersurface of tree trunk's thickest part (the "butt" above the root, as opposed to "top"), where the end of the stem makes contact with the soil.  It may affect the roots as well, causing a disease known as root rot.  It then moves up into the interior of the plant, producing a roughly conical column of dead, rotted plant matter, up to one and a half meters long in severe cases.  Such an infection is likely to impair the transport properties of the xylem tissue found at the center of the stem.  It also reduces the stem's structural properties and makes the plant more vulnerable to toppling.  One particularly virulent species of fungus associated with butt rot is Serpula himantioides.

Route 184 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States. It is an old section of Route 440 that was rerouted. Route 184's western end is at an intersection with the Garden State Parkway in Woodbridge Township; NJ 184's eastern end is at an intersection with Route 35 in Perth Amboy. The highway passes several local landmarks along the highway, but is less populated than the surrounding area. The entire highway is concurrent with County Route 501, but is not county-maintained. 
The route originated as Route S4, which became NJ 440 on January 1, 1953. In 1974, a part of Route 440 was bypassed and rerouted, and the New Jersey State Highway Department reassigned the former alignment as NJ 184.

The route's southern terminus is at the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector (NJ 446X) off-ramp to U.S. Route 30 and terminates at its parent, New Jersey Route 87 (Huron Boulevard) nearby. Route 187 is not maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, but instead the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which maintains the Brigantine Connector nearby.
Route 187 originates as an alignment of State Highway Route S-4-A, designated in the 1927 renumbering of highways. After Route S-4-A's extension from Ocean County was canceled, Route S-4-A along this alignment became State Highway Route S-56, as a spur of Route 56. Route S-56 became Route 87 in the renumbering, and by the 1980s, Route 87 was realigned off of Brigantine Boulevard and onto Huron Avenue. The route was later renumbered Route 187. During construction of the Brigantine Connector in 2001, Route 187 was severed from its former southern terminus at U.S. Route 30 and truncated back to its current alignment.

[[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]]
CATEGORIES: Cellular respiration, Nucleotides, Photosynthesis, Coenzymes

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, abbreviated NAD+, is a coenzyme found in all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, since it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide.
In metabolism, NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is an oxidizing agent – it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] metabolism are targets for drug discovery.
In organisms, NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] can be synthesized from simple building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles them back into the active form. Some NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP[tpl]+[/tpl]); the chemistry of this related coenzyme is similar to that of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl], but it has different roles in metabolism.
Although NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is written with a superscript plus sign because of the formal charge on a particular nitrogen atom, at physiological pH for the most part it is actually a singly-charged anion (charge of minus 1), while NADH is a doubly-charged anion.
NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is considered the "V factor" required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae.

The Second Continental Congress was a convention of delegates from the Thirteen Colonies that started meeting in the summer of 1775, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, soon after warfare in the American Revolutionary War had begun. It succeeded the First Continental Congress, which met between September 5, 1774 and October 25, 1774, also in Philadelphia. The second Congress managed the colonial war effort, and moved incrementally towards independence, adopting the United States Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. By raising armies, directing strategy, appointing diplomats, and making formal treaties, the Congress acted as the de facto national government of what became the United States.Cogliano, Revolutionary America, 1763-1815, 113.
When the Second Continental Congress came together on May 10, 1775 it was, in effect, a reconvening of the First Continental Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting were in attendance at the second, and the delegates appointed the same president (Peyton Randolph) and secretary (Charles Thomson).Burnett, Continental Congress, 64–67. Notable new arrivals included Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania and John Hancock of Massachusetts. Within two weeks, Randolph was summoned back to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses; he was replaced in the Virginia delegation by Thomas Jefferson, who arrived several weeks later. Henry Middleton was elected as president to replace Randolph, but he declined. Hancock was elected president on May 24.Fowler, Baron of Beacon Hill, 189.
Delegates from twelve of the Thirteen Colonies were present when the Second Continental Congress convened. Georgia had not participated in the First Continental Congress and did not initially send delegates to the Second Continental Congress. On May 13, 1775, Lyman Hall was admitted as a delegate from the Parish of St. John's in the Colony of Georgia, not as a delegate from the colony itself.[tpl]cite book| year=1904–1939| title=Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789| editor=Worthington C.

Egmont National Park is located south of New Plymouth, close to the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand.  It is named after the mountain which dominates its environs, which itself was named by Captain Cook after John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont, the First Lord of the Admiralty  who promoted Cook's first voyage. Taranaki has been the Māori name for the mountain for many centuries, and the mountain itself now has two alternative official names, "Mount Taranaki" and "Mount Egmont". 
The park, established in 1900, is dominated by the dormant volcano of Mount Taranaki.[tpl]cite web |url=http://gns.cri.nz/content/download/6149/33766/file/QuickFacts%20%20MtTaranaki.pdf | title= Volcano Fact Sheet: Mount Taranaki / Egmont Volcano | publisher = GNS Science | date = 2010 |accessdate= 2012-01-10[/tpl]  The park receives massive annual precipitation which is essentially orographic in origin as moist westerlies moving inland from the Tasman hit Mount Taranaki and the adjacent Pouakai and Kaitake ranges and are thus forced to rise. Since the area has high annual rainfall and a mild coastal climate there is a lush rainforest covering the foothills, a forest which is nationally significant for the total absence of beech trees (genus Nothofagus).

This is a list of the mayors of the City of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Until 1854, Ottawa was known as Bytown. Over the course of Ottawa's history, the borders of the municipality have greatly expanded through annexations. This most recently occurred in 2001 when a number of neighbouring communities were amalgamated with Ottawa, resulting in a new legal entity that took the name of one of its municipal predecessors.

The Battle of the Saintes (known to the French as the Bataille de la Dominique, or Battle of Dominica) took place over 4 days, 9 April 1782 – 12 April 1782, during the American War of Independence, and was a victory of a British fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney over a French fleet under the Comte de Grasse forcing the French and Spanish to abandon a planned invasion of Jamaica.
The battle is named after the Saintes (or Saints), a group of islands between Guadeloupe and Dominica in the West Indies. The French fleet defeated here by the Royal Navy was the same French fleet that had blockaded the British Army during the Siege of Yorktown. The British are sometimes credited with pioneering the tactic of "breaking the line" in the battle, though this is disputed.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

Thaddeus Stevens (April 4, 1792 – August 11, 1868) was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania and one of the leaders of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party during the 1860s.  A fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against  African-Americans, Stevens sought to secure their rights during Reconstruction, in opposition to President Andrew Johnson.  As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during the American Civil War, he played a major part in the war's financing.
Stevens was born in rural Vermont, in poverty, and with a club foot, giving him a limp he kept his entire life.  He moved to Pennsylvania as a young man, and quickly became a successful lawyer in Gettysburg.  He interested himself in municipal affairs, and then in politics. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where he became a strong advocate of free public education. Financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to the larger city of Lancaster.  There, he joined the Whig Party, and was elected to Congress in 1848. His activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes and he did not seek reelection in 1852.  After a brief flirtation with the Know-Nothing Party, Stevens joined the newly formed Republican Party, and was elected to Congress again in 1858.  There, with fellow radicals such as Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, he opposed the expansion of slavery and concessions to the South as war came.
Stevens argued that slavery should not survive the war; he was frustrated by the slowness of President Abraham Lincoln to support his position.  He guided the government's financial legislation through the House as Ways and Means chairman.  As the war progressed towards a northern victory, Stevens came to believe that not only should slavery be abolished, but that African-Americans should be given a stake in the South's future through the confiscation of land from planters to be distributed to the freedmen. His plans went too far for the Moderate Republicans, and were not enacted.
After Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, Stevens came into conflict with the new president, Johnson, who sought rapid restoration of the seceded states without guarantees for freedmen. The difference in views caused an ongoing battle between Johnson and Congress, with Stevens leading the Radical Republicans. After gains in the 1866 election the radicals took control of Reconstruction away from Johnson. Stevens's last great battle was to secure  articles of impeachment in the House against Johnson, though the Senate did not convict the President.  Historiographical views of Stevens have dramatically shifted over the years, from the early 20th-century view of Stevens as reckless and motivated by hatred of the white South, to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded him for his egalitarian views.

CATEGORIES: History of Nottinghamshire, Local government in Nottinghamshire, Nottingham, Shrievalties of English cities

The Sheriff of Nottingham was historically the office responsible for enforcing law and order in Nottingham and bringing criminals to justice. For years the post has been directly appointed by the Lord Mayor of Nottingham and in modern times, with the existence of the police force, the position is entirely ceremonial and sustained to boost tourism due to the legendary connection with the fictional Sheriff of Nottingham in the tales of Robin Hood. However the historical position goes back to Anglo-Saxon times. The office is sometimes confused with that of the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire (that office had previously existed, from 1068 until 1568, as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests.)

DiC Entertainment (pronounced "deek", rendered "DiC") was an international film and television production company.  In addition to animated (and occasionally live-action) television shows such as Inspector Gadget (1983–1986), Madeline (1993-1994),  Sonic the Hedgehog (1993-1994), Sabrina, The Animated Series, (1999-2000), Liberty's Kids (2002-2003), Super Duper Sumos (2002-2003), Strawberry Shortcake (2003-2008) and Trollz (2005-2006) DIC produced live-action feature films while under Disney, including 1998's Meet the Deedles and 1999's Inspector Gadget.
It was founded in 1971 as DIC Audiovisuel by Frenchman Jean Chalopin in Paris, as a subsidiary of RTL Group (RTL), Europe's leading entertainment company, which today, is majority-owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.  "DIC" was originally an acronym for Diffusion, Information et Communication. They later had a US office in Burbank. Andy Heyward then bought the business and DiC became an American company.  The company was also known as The Incredible World of DiC, DiC. Audiovisuel, DiC Enterprises,  DIC Animation City and DIC Productions. In 2008, DIC and Cookie Jar Group merged, and the DIC name ceased to exist.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080723a.php|title=COOKIE JAR ENTERTAINMENT EXPANDS BRAND PORTFOLIO, TALENT AND GLOBAL REACH WITH CLOSING OF DIC TRANSACTION |work=Cookie Jar Group |date=2008-07-23 |accessdate=2008-12-20[/tpl] In late 2012, DHX Media acquired DIC for $111 million dollars, and DIC now operates an in-name-only unit of DHX Media.

Henry van Wart (1784 - 1873), an American who became British by special act of Parliament, founded the Birmingham Stock Exchange and served as one of Birmingham's first Aldermen and a director of the Birmingham Banking Company.
He was married to Sarah Irving, the sister of author Washington Irving. They had four children: William (1812 - 1868), Matilda (b. 1814), Marianne (b. 1816). and George (b. 1817; later a wine merchant). William later named his first- born Washington Irving Van Wart (b. 1836), whose niece in turn was called Rosalinda Irving Van Wart (b. 1874). 
Henry and Sarah met when he was employed by her family's New York company, Irving & Smith, and they moved to England when he was tasked with opening a Liverpool branch of the firm.
After that enterprise failed, they moved to Birmingham, and he set up a profitable business, exporting the city's goods to America.
Washington Irving lived with the van Warts at four of their homes in Birmingham, light- heartedly christening two of these buildings "Castle van Tromp" and writing some of his most successful stories at them.
He is also known to have worshipped at St Paul's Church in St Paul's Square, Birmingham.
Van Wart developed a friendship with Louisiana businessman Frederick W. Tilton, who became Van Wart's agent in New Orleans. Tilton endowed the library at Tulane University.

He has composed a lot of songs based on poems by Greek and foreign poets, such as Euripides, Aristophanes, Constantine P. Cavafy, Giorgos Seferis, Yannis Ritsos, Odysseas Elytis and Nikos Kavvadias as well as Bertolt Brecht, Nazim Hikmet, Wolf Biermann, Vladimir Mayakovsky and Maurice Maeterlinck. He has also written operas, symphonic music, chamber music and music for the theatre and cinema.
One of his most popular works was the setting to music of poems by Nikos Kavvadias in his albums Grammes Orizonton (Horizons' Lines) and Stavros tou Notou (Southern Cross). Some of the music was originally written for a TV series, the theme of which was marine. The songs were liked and he went on to the studio to record some more many of which were included in the aforementioned albums.
Thanos Mikroutsikos has also been involved in Greece's political life since the 60's. During the turbulent years of the military junta (1967–1974), he was persecuted by the regime for his anti-dictatorial activities and ideas. When the junta collapsed he continued being actively involved in politics as a member of the maoist EKKE, especially in the first years after the restoration of democracy.
After the elections of October 1993 he was appointed by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) which formed the new government, as Alternate-Minister of Culture with late Melina Mercouri as minister. In 1994, after the death of the latter, he was appointed minister of culture. He remained at this position until 1996. His brother is the popular TV host and musician Andreas Mikroutsikos.

[[Buteyko method]]

CATEGORIES: Respiration, Ukrainian inventions, Soviet inventions

The Buteyko method or Buteyko Breathing Technique is a form of complementary or alternative physical therapy that proposes the use of breathing exercises as a treatment for asthma as well as other conditions. The method takes its name from Ukrainian doctor Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko, who first formulated its principles during the 1950s.  This method is based on the assumption that numerous medical conditions, including asthma, are caused by chronically increased respiratory rate or deeper breathing (hyperventilation).  However, this theory is not widely supported in the medical community due to the lack of evidence supporting either the theory behind the method or that it works in practice.  This method purportedly retrains the breathing pattern through chronic repetitive breathing exercises to correct the hyperventilation, which, according to the method's proponents, will therefore treat or cure asthma as well as any other conditions purportedly caused by hyperventilation.  At the core of the Buteyko method is a series of reduced-breathing exercises that focus on nasal-breathing, breath-holding and relaxation.
Research into the use of the Buteyko method has focused almost exclusively on the treatment of asthma, and have had methodological problems.  Studies have not found objective measures to support its use such as improvement in lung function, though there are results showing it may improve subjective measures such as asthma symptoms and quality of life.  Reviews of this medical literature have come to different conclusions about the strength of evidence supporting the Buteyko method, with some literature saying the evidence does not support its use, while others have concluded the evidence is enough to consider qualified support.  The literature that supports considering its use note the Buteyko method should be used with traditional therapies (and not in place of mainstream treatment) and is unlikely to affect the underlying cause of asthma.  There is no support for the use of the Buteyko method in other diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or any of the over 150 diseases supporters of this method claim to treat.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

[[SylvaC]]
CATEGORIES: Ceramics manufacturers of England, Staffordshire pottery

SylvaC (with a deliberate capital C at the end) is a brand of British ornamental pottery characterised primarily by figurines of animals and Toby Jugs. The SylvaC company briefly ceased production in 1982 although production of SylvaC pieces was resumed in 1998 by the current trademark holder Norman Williams.
The company was founded in 1894 by William Copestake and William Shaw. They gave their names to the fledgling company - Shaw and Copestake. Copestake left in 1895, however, and Richard Hull became Shaw's partner. Hull's son joined in 1936 and in 1938 the Thomas Lawrence Falcon Pottery was bought (which produced pottery with the distinctive 'falcon' mark on it). However, the Shaw and Copestake company maintained its original name right up until the end.
Central to the SylvaC line throughout its history were figurines of animals, and rabbits in particular. Dogs were also popular and virtually every breed ended-up being characterised in pottery. Many variations of Toby Jugs were produced, including 'character' versions which celebrated events or tied into product advertising.
Although many colours and glazes were used, most people remember the distinctive orange or green glazes most.
SylvaC pieces are not rare; however, they are becoming collectable, and the best pieces can fetch high prices. There is a common belief that pieces made after 1982 are fakes or somehow "less" SylvaC than pieces made before then. As with any collectable, there is a vested interest in keeping prices high despite the fact that SylvaC was never particularly expensive to produce and not in any sense rare and certainly never meant to be high art. The Falconware/SylvaC brands have passed through many hands since the days of Shaw&Copestake and the notion of a "Golden Era" of SylvaC is sadly a very modern construct that has had a detramental effect on all of the great pottery houses, especially those based in Stoke-On-Trent.
The Company was purchased and registered in July 2012 by Rolf Groth of Liverpool in England, with the intent of trading in vintage and special edition pieces.

The Houston Museum District is an association of 20 museums, galleries, cultural centers and community organizations located in Houston, Texas, dedicated to promoting art, science, history and cultural.
The Houston Museum District currently includes 20 museums that recorded a collective attendance of just over 8 million in 2012. All of the museums offer free times or days and 11 of the museums are free all the time.[tpl]cite web |title=HMDA Fact Sheet |format=PDF |publisher = Houston Museum District Association | url = http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/Fact%20Sheet%202008.doc | accessdate = 2009-04-07[/tpl]
Bordered roughly by Rice University, the Neartown area and Texas Medical Center, the Museum District specifically refers to the area located within a 1.5-mile radius of the Mecom Fountain in Hermann Park. The Museum District is served by four stops on the METRORail, one specifically named for it and is easily accessible from US 59, State Highway 288 and Main Street.
The beginnings of the Museum District are found in 1977, when it became apparent that some action needed to be taken to provide easier access to the museums of the area. This call for community improvement evolved into the non-profit Montrose Project by the mid-80s but changed into the Museum District Development Association of Houston (MDDAH) shortly thereafter.  Based on the works of this organization, the Museum District was formally recognized by the City of Houston in 1989. The founding organization was dissolved in 1994, but the Museum District is now under the auspices of the Houston Museum District Association, founded in 1997.
The Museum District attracts visitors, students and volunteers of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities to learn about and celebrate art, history, culture, and nature around the world.

North of Highway 401, it continues as Ontario Highway 404. The parkway runs through the parklands of the Don River Valley, after which it is named. It has a maximum speed limit of [tpl]convert|90|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Toronto |title=By-Law No. 922-2003: To amend further Metropolitan By-law No. 109-86, respecting maximum rates of speed on certain former Metropolitan Roads, regarding Don Valley Parkway. |type=PDF |url=http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/bylaws/2003/law0922.pdf |date= September 24, 2003 |accessdate=September 13, 2011[/tpl] for its entire length of [tpl]convert|15.0|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. It is six lanes for most of its length but it is eight lanes north of York Mills and four lanes south of Eastern. As a municipal road, it is patrolled by the Toronto Police Service.
The parkway was the second expressway to be built by Metropolitan Toronto (Metro). Planning began in 1954, the year of Metro's formation. The first section opened during 1961 and the entire route was completed by the end of 1966. South of Bloor Street, the expressway was constructed over existing roadways. North of Bloor Street, it was built on a new alignment through the valley, requiring the removal of several hills, diversion of the Don River and the clearing of woodland. North of Eglinton Avenue, the expressway follows the former Woodbine Avenue right-of-way north to Highway 401.
The parkway operates well beyond its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day and is known for daily traffic jams; some sections carry an average of 100,000 vehicles a day. Planned as part of a larger expressway network within Toronto, it was one of the few expressways built before the public opposition which cancelled many of the others.

CATEGORIES: Neurophysiology, Neuroanatomy

A nerve fiber is a threadlike extension of a nerve cell and consists of an axon and myelin sheath (if present) in the nervous system. There are nerve fibers in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. A nerve fiber may be myelinated and/or unmyelinated. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is produced by oligodendroglia cells. Schwann cells form myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Schwann cells can also make a thin covering for an axon which does not consist of myelin (in the PNS). A peripheral nerve fiber consists of an axon, myelin sheath, Schwann cells and its endoneurium. There are no endoneurium and Schwann cells in the central nervous system.

DIs are frequently used to connect an electric guitar or electric bass to a mixing console's microphone input.  The DI performs level matching, balancing, and either active buffering or passive impedance matching/impedance bridging to minimize noise, distortion, and ground loops.
DI boxes are extensively used with professional and semi-professional PA systems and in sound recording studios.

[[Machining]]
CATEGORIES: Machining

Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The many processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing, in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the "controlled" part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).
The precise meaning of the term machining has evolved over the past one and a half centuries as technology has advanced. In the 18th century, the word machinist simply meant a person who built or repaired machines. This person's work was done mostly by hand, using processes such as the carving of wood and the hand-forging and hand-filing of metal. At the time, millwrights and builders of new kinds of engines (meaning, more or less, machines of any kind), such as James Watt or John Wilkinson, would fit the definition. The noun machine tool and the verb to machine (machined, machining) did not yet exist. Around the middle of the 19th century, the latter words were coined as the concepts that they described evolved into widespread existence. Therefore, during the Machine Age, machining referred to (what we today might call) the "traditional" machining processes, such as turning, boring, drilling, milling, broaching, sawing, shaping, planing, reaming, and tapping.Machining: An Introduction In these "traditional" or "conventional" machining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill presses, or others, are used with a sharp cutting tool to remove material to achieve a desired geometry.Additive Manufacturing Advances Another Step Since the advent of new technologies such as electrical discharge machining, electrochemical machining, electron beam machining, photochemical machining, and ultrasonic machining, the retronym "conventional machining" can be used to differentiate those classic technologies from the newer ones. In current usage, the term "machining" without qualification usually implies the traditional machining processes.
Machining is a part of the manufacture of many metal products, but it can also be used on materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and composites.Machining Page A person who specializes in machining is called a machinist. A room, building, or company where machining is done is called a machine shop. Machining can be a business, a hobby, or both.Machining and Metalworking at Home Much of modern day machining is carried out by computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and operation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.

[tpl]Baptist[/tpl]The Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association (FBFA) is an association of independent fundamentalist African-American Baptist churches.
In 1962 Reverend Richard C. Mattox, of Cleveland, Ohio, led conservative-fundamentalist black ministers and congregations to form the Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association. The association provides fundamentalist black Baptist churches a means of fellowship in the areas of evangelism and foreign missions. Each congregation is independent and autonomous. The FBFA meets on an annual basis.
A number of churches in the Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association hold dual affiliation with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. Headquarters are in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In the area of Christian education, the FBFA partners with Cedarville University in Cedarville, Ohio.
Though largely ignored by books and the Internet, and sometimes confused with the predominantly white Fundamental Baptist Fellowship of America, this association of churches does exist, with churches mostly in the midwestern United States.

A travel survey (or travel diary or travel behavior inventory) is a survey of individual travel behavior.  Most surveys collect information about an individual (socio-economic, demographic, etc.), their household (size, structure, relationships), and a diary of their journeys on a given day (their start and end location, start and end time, mode of travel, accompanyment and purpose of travel).
Major travel surveys are conducted in metropolitan areas typically once a decade. Some regions, notably metropolitan Seattle, Washington conduct a panel survey, which interviews the same people year after year, to see how their particular behavior evolves over time.

Pollinium, or plural pollinia, is a coherent mass of pollen grains in a plant.  
They are the product of only one anther, but are transferred, during pollination, as a single unit. This is regularly seen in plants such as orchids and many species of milkweeds (Asclepiadoideae).
Most orchids have waxy pollinia. These are connected to one or two elongate stipes, which in turn are attached to the sticky viscidium.
Some orchid genera have mealy pollinia. These are tapering into a caudicle (stalk), attached to the viscidium. They extend into the middle section of the column.
The combination of pollinia, caudicles, stipes and viscidium form the pollinarium.

Parents may tell their children that if they misbehave, the bogeyman will get them. Bogeymen may target a specific mischief—for instance, a bogeyman that punishes children who suck their thumbs—or general misbehaviour, depending on what purpose needs serving. In some cases, the bogeyman is a nickname for the Devil.
Bogeyman tales vary by region. The bogeyman is usually a masculine entity but can be any gender or simply androgynous.

Éric Serge Gagné ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɡɑɲe[/tpl]) (born January 7, 1976) is a Canadian former professional baseball pitcher. Signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball as a free agent in 1995, Gagné began his career as a starting pitcher. After he struggled in that role, the Dodgers converted Gagné from a starter to a reliever, where for three years (2002–2004) he was statistically the most outstanding closer in the game, winning the Cy Young Award in 2003. During that period, he set a major league record by converting 84 consecutive save opportunities. The phrase "Game Over" was heavily used by the Dodgers and the media in connection with his appearances to finish close games.
Gagné played sparingly in 2005 and 2006 due to injury, undergoing elbow surgery in 2005 and back surgery in 2006. The Dodgers did not re-sign him after 2006, and Gagné started the 2007 season with the Texas Rangers, where he briefly enjoyed success again as a closer. However, he was less successful in stints with the Boston Red Sox and Milwaukee Brewers, and was finally released after the 2008 season.
In December 2007, days after signing a contract for 2008 with the Milwaukee Brewers, he was linked to baseball's steroids scandal after he was named in the Mitchell Report.

[[Asclepiadoideae]]

CATEGORIES: Apocynaceae, Plant subfamilies

According to APG II, the Asclepiadaceae is a former plant family now treated as a subfamily (subfamily Asclepiadoideae) in the Apocynaceae (Bruyns 2000). Botanist Pete Raids has been credited with the majority of work in this field.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
They form a group of perennial herbs, twining shrubs, lianas or rarely trees but notably also contain a significant number of leafless stem succulents. The name comes from the type genus Asclepias (milkweeds).
There are 348 genera, with about 2,900 species. They are mainly located in the tropics to subtropics, especially in Africa and South America.
The florally advanced tribe Stapeliae within this family contains the relatively familiar stem succulent genera such as Huernia, Stapelia and Hoodia. They are remarkable for the complex mechanisms they have developed for pollination, which independently parallel the unrelated Orchidaceae, especially in the grouping of their pollen into pollinia. The fragrance from the flowers, often called "carrion", attracts flies. The flies pollinate the flowers.
Many new hybrids have been formed due to the unique fertilization method of the flowers.

The 2010 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XIX Commonwealth Games, were held in Delhi, India, from 3 to 14 October 2010. A total of 6,081 athletes from 71 Commonwealth nations and dependencies competed in 21 sports and 272 events, making it the largest Commonwealth Games to date. It was also the largest international multi-sport event to be staged in Delhi and India, eclipsing the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982. The opening and closing ceremonies were held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main stadium of the event. It was the first time that the Commonwealth Games were held in India and the second time it was held in Asia after Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. The official mascot of the Games was Shera and the official song of the Games, "Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto", was composed by celebrated Indian musician A.R. Rahman.
Preparation for the Games received widespread international media attention, with criticism being levelled against the organisers for the slow pace of work, as well as issues related to security and hygiene. However, all member nations of the Commonwealth of Nations participated in the event, except Fiji, which is suspended from the Commonwealth, and Tokelau, which didn't send a team, in spite of threats of boycotts and athlete withdrawals. The internationally acclaimed opening ceremony improved the image of the Games,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/oct/03/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-delhi-india |title='India has arrived': spectacular ceremony opens Commonwealth Games |publisher=The Guardian, UK |date= 3 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burke| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101006004503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/oct/03/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-delhi-india| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8039988/Commonwealth-Games-2010-India-opens-doors-to-the-world-at-opening-ceremony.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2010: India opens doors to the world at opening ceremony |work=The Telegraph |date=3 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Hart| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101006045221/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8039988/Commonwealth-Games-2010-India-opens-doors-to-the-world-at-opening-ceremony.html| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and dispelled negative notions surrounding them, with many observers remarking that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending.[tpl]cite news|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/101015/sports/cgames2010_aus|title=Australia praises India's 'exceptional' Games|date=15 October 2010|agency=Agence France-Presse| accessdate=14 February 2011 [/tpl] The President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid, which was reiterated by the Australian Ministry of Sports.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139|title=India should aim for Olympics: Australian Sports Minister|publisher=NDTV|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101008222034/http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139| archivedate= 8 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games-2010/news/Games-good-foundation-for-Olympic-bid-by-India-Rogge/articleshow/6680736.cms|title=Games good foundation for Olympic bid by India: Rogge|work=The Times of India | date=4 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] Commonwealth games Federation chief Mike Fennell stated that "Delhi delivered a fantastic Games".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/sports/cwg-2010/Delhi-delivered-a-fantastic-Games/newdelhi/SP-Article10-613055.aspx |title=â€˜Delhi delivered a fantastic Gamesâ€™ |work=Hindustan Times |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2012[/tpl] Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010|first=Peter|last=Hanlon|title=It's time to reflect on how Delhi got it right| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101017152227/http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html| archivedate= 17 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

Tonina (or Toniná in Spanish orthography) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site and ruined city of the Maya civilization located in what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas, some 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the town of Ocosingo.
The site is medium to large, with groups of temple-pyramids set on terraces rising some [tpl]convert|71|m|ft[/tpl] above a plaza,Kelly 2001, p.355. a large court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame, and over 100 carved monuments, most dating from the 6th century through the 9th centuries AD, during the Classic period. Toniná is distinguished by its well preserved stucco sculptures and particularly by its in-the-round carved monuments, produced to an extent not seen in Mesoamerica since the end of the much earlier Olmec civilization.Martin & Grube 2000, p.177. Coe 1999, p.130.
Toniná was an aggressive state in the Late Classic, using warfare to develop a powerful kingdom.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.472. For much of its history, Toniná was engaged in sporadic warfare with Palenque, its greatest rival and one of the most important polities in the west of the Maya region, although Toniná eventually became the dominant city in the west.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.451.
The city is notable for having the last known Long Count date on any Maya monument, marking the end of the Classic Maya period in AD 909.Martin & Grube 2000, p.177.

The Scottsboro Boys were nine black teenagers accused of rape in Alabama in 1931. The landmark set of legal cases from this incident dealt with racism and the right to a fair trial. The case included a frameup, an all-white jury, rushed trials, an attempted lynching, and an angry mob; it is frequently given as an example of an overall miscarriage of justice.
On March 25, 1931, several people were hoboing on a freight train traveling between Chattanooga and Memphis, Tennessee. Several white teenagers jumped off the train and reported to the sheriff that they had been attacked by a group of black teenagers. The sheriff deputized a posse, stopped and searched the train at Paint Rock, Alabama, arrested the black teenagers, and found two young white women who accused the teenagers of rape. The case was first heard in Scottsboro, Alabama, in three rushed trials, where the defendants received poor legal representation. All but thirteen-year-old Roy Wright were convicted of rape and sentenced to death, the common sentence in Alabama at the time for black men convicted of raping white women. But with help from the American Communist Party, the case was appealed. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed seven of the eight convictions, and granted thirteen-year-old Eugene Williams a new trial because he was a juvenile. Chief Justice John C. Anderson dissented, however, ruling that the defendants had been denied an impartial jury, fair trial, fair sentencing, and effective counsel. While waiting for their trials, eight of the nine defendants stayed in Kilby Prison.
The case was returned to the lower court and the judge allowed a change of venue, moving the retrials to Decatur, Alabama. Judge Horton was appointed. During the retrials, one of the alleged victims admitted fabricating the rape story and asserted that none of the Scottsboro Boys touched either of the white women. The jury found the defendants guilty, but the judge set aside the verdict and granted a new trial. After a new series of trials, the verdict was the same: guilty. The cases were ultimately tried three times. For the third time a jury—now with one black member—returned a third guilty verdict. Charges were finally dropped for four of the nine defendants. Sentences for the rest ranged from 75 years to death. All but two served prison sentences. One was shot in prison by a guard. Two escaped, were charged with crimes, and were sent back to prison. Clarence Norris, the oldest defendant and the only one sentenced to death, "jumped parole" and went into hiding in 1946.  He was pardoned by George Wallace in 1976 after he was found, and wrote a book about his experiences. Norris, the last surviving defendant, died in 1989.
"The Scottsboro Boys", as they soon became known, were defended by many in the North and attacked by many in the South. The case is now widely considered a miscarriage of justice that eventually produced the end of all-white juries in the South. The case has inspired and has been examined in literature, music, theatre, film and television.  On November 21, 2013, Alabama's parole board voted to grant posthumous pardons to the Scottsboro Boys.

Undecane (also known as hendecane) is a liquid alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula CH3(CH2)9CH3.  It is used as a mild sex attractant for various types of moths and cockroaches, and an alert signal for a variety of ants.Hölldobler B, Wilson EO (1990). The Ants. Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-04075-9, p. 287 It has 159 isomers.
Undecane may also be used as an internal standard in gas chromatography when working with other hydrocarbons. Since the boiling point of undecane (196°C) is well known, it may be used as a comparison for retention times in a gas chromatograph for molecules whose structure has been freshly elucidated. For example, if one is working with a 50 m crosslinked methyl silicone capillary column with an oven temperature increasing slowly, beginning around 60°C, an 11-carbon molecule like undecane may be used as an internal standard to be compared with the retention times of other 10-, 11-, or 12- carbon molecules, depending on their structures.

[[Kuiseb River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Namibia, Geography of Erongo Region

The Kuiseb River in Namibia flows from the Khomas highlands west of Windhoek to Walvis Bay. The Kuiseb is an ephemeral river with a mean run-off of roughly 20 million cubic metres per annum.
It is bordered on one side by some of the tallest sand dunes in the world, and on the other by barren rock. The red sand dunes south of the river reach heights over 150 meters. The prevailing winds blow the dunes northward, but their movement is blocked by the river. In the process, so much sand and silt is deposited in the Kuiseb that it only reaches the sea while it is in flood. Friedenau Dam, built in 1972, is located on the river.Friedenau at NamWater

[[Distribution function]]
CATEGORIES: Statistical mechanics, Dynamical systems

Here, N is the total number of particles and n is the number density of particles - the number of particles per unit volume, or the density divided by the mass of individual particles.
Particle distribution functions are often used in plasma physics to describe wave–particle interactions and velocity-space instabilities.  Distribution functions are also used in fluid mechanics, statistical mechanics and nuclear physics.
Plasma theories such as magnetohydrodynamics may assume the particles to be in thermodynamic equilibrium.  In this case, the distribution function is Maxwellian.  This distribution function allows fluid flow and different temperatures in the directions parallel to, and perpendicular to, the local magnetic field.  More complex distribution functions may also be used since plasmas are rarely in thermal equilibrium.
The mathematical analog of a distribution is a measure; the time evolution of a measure on a phase space is the topic of study in dynamical systems.

CHUM Limited was a media company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from 1945 to 2007. Immediately prior to its acquisition, it held full or joint control of two Canadian television systems — Citytv and A-Channel (formerly NewNet, now CTV Two) — comprising 11 local stations, and one CBC Television (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) affiliate, one provincial educational channel, and 20 branded specialty television channels, most notably MuchMusic and its various spinoffs. In addition, CHUM controlled 33 radio stations across Canada. At various points in its history, CHUM owned other radio stations and ATV/Atlantic Satellite Network in Atlantic Canada.
CHUM was taken over by Bell Globemedia (now Bell Media), owner of the CTV Television Network in July 2006. Regulatory approval was made conditional on the sale of CHUM's five Citytv stations to Rogers Communications. CTVglobemedia took control of CHUM's other assets effective June 22, 2007. The company itself has since been renamed CTV Limited (now CTV Inc.) and continues operation as a subsidiary of Bell Media.  Its radio broadcasting division, CHUM Radio has since became Bell Media Radio after Bell Canada took control of CTV's assets, thus becoming Bell Media. Its Toronto radio stations TSN RADIO 1050 and 104.5 CHUM-FM continues use "CHUM" as their station's call sign. However, CHUM no longer operates as a broadcasting company separate from its new parent. The headquarters were located at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, the famous CHUM-City Building,  Today it is used by Bell Media.
With the sale of CTVglobemedia to Bell Canada as announced in September 2010 (pending CRTC and Competition Bureau approval), Bell would (if approved) take control of most of CHUM's former assets for the first time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2010/10/c8677.html|title=Bell to acquire 100% of Canada's No.1 media company CTV|publisher=CNW Group|author=Bell Canada|date=2010-09-10|accessdate=2010-09-10[/tpl]  And CTVglobemedia became known as Bell Media in April 1, 2011, after the deal to purchase the stations was finalized and the CHUM name was completely phased out from its new entity.

Büsingen am Hochrhein ("Buesingen on the Upper Rhine"), commonly known as Büsingen, is a German town ([tpl]convert|7.62|km2|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) entirely surrounded by the Swiss canton of Schaffhausen and, south across the Rhine, by the Swiss cantons of Zürich and Thurgau. It has a population of about 1,450 inhabitants. Since the early 19th century, the town has been separated from the rest of Germany by a narrow strip of land (at its narrowest, about 700 m wide) containing the Swiss village of Dörflingen.
Administratively, Büsingen is part of Germany, forming part of the district of Konstanz, in the Bundesland of Baden-Württemberg, but economically, it forms part of the Swiss customs area, as do the independent principality of Liechtenstein and the Italian town of Campione d'Italia. There are no border controls between Switzerland and Büsingen or the rest of Germany since Switzerland joined the Schengen Area in 2008/09.
Büsingen is highly regarded as a holiday destination in summer by both German and Swiss visitors from around the area for its recreational areas along the Rhine. The town is also the home of the European Nazarene College, a relatively large and internationally-oriented Bible college.

Babes in Toyland is a Laurel and Hardy musical film released on March 10, 1934. The film is also known by its alternate titles Laurel and Hardy in Toyland, Revenge Is Sweet (the 1948 European reissue title), March of the Wooden Soldiers and Wooden Soldiers (in the United States).
Based on Victor Herbert's popular 1903 operetta Babes in Toyland, the film was produced by Hal Roach, directed by Charles Rogers and Gus Meins, and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Originally filmed in black-and-white, there are also two computer colorized versions.[tpl]cite book |editor1-first=Leonard |editor1-last=Maltin |editor1-link=Leonard Maltin |title=Leonard Maltin's 2008 Movie Guide |year=2007|publisher=Signet |location=New York |isbn=978-0-451-22186-5 |page=73[/tpl]
Although the 1934 film makes use of many of the characters in the original play, as well as several of the songs, the plot is almost completely unlike that of the original stage production. In contrast to the stage version, the film's story takes place entirely in Toyland, which is inhabited by Mother Goose (Virginia Karns) and other well known fairy tale characters.

Thanjavur, formerly Tanjore,Pletcher 2010, p. 195 is a city which is the headquarters of the Thanjavur District in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Scholars believe the name Thanjavur is derived from Tanjan, a legendary demon in Hindu mythology. While the early history of Thanjavur remains unclear, the city first rose to prominence during the reign of Medieval Cholas when it served as the capital of the empire. After the fall of Cholas, the city was ruled by various dynasties like Pandyas, Vijayanagar Empire, Madurai Nayaks, Thanjavur Nayaks, Thanjavur Marathas and the British Empire. It has been a part of independent India since 1947.
Thanjavur is an important centre of South Indian religion, art, and architecture. Most of the Great Living Chola Temples, which are UNESCO World Heritage Monuments, are located in and around Thanjavur. The foremost among these, the Brihadeeswara Temple, is located in the centre of the city. Thanjavur is also home to Tanjore painting, a painting style unique to the region. The city is an important agricultural centre located in the Cauvery Delta and is known as the "Rice bowl of Tamil Nadu".

In telecommunications, a point-to-point connection refers to a communications connection between two nodes or endpoints.  An example is a telephone call, in which one telephone is connected with one other, and what is said by one caller can only be heard by the other.  This is contrasted with a point-to-multipoint or  broadcast communication topology, in which many nodes can receive information transmitted by one node.  Other examples of point-to-point communications links are  leased lines, microwave relay links, and two way radio.  Examples of point-to-multipoint communications systems are radio and television broadcasting.
The term is also used in computer networking and computer architecture to refer to a wire or other connection that links only two computers or circuits, as opposed to other network topologies such as buses or crossbar switches which can connect many communications devices. 
Point-to-point is sometimes abbreviated as P2P, Pt2Pt.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl] This usage of P2P is distinct from P2P referring to peer-to-peer file sharing networks.

Mount Kenya is the source of the name of the Republic of Kenya.
Mount Kenya is a stratovolcano created approximately 3 million years after the opening of the East African rift.
Before glaciation, it was [tpl]convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high. It was covered by an ice cap for thousands of years. This has resulted in very eroded slopes and numerous valleys radiating from the centre. There are currently 11 small glaciers. The forested slopes are an important source of water for much of Kenya.
There are several vegetation bands from the base to the summit. The lower slopes are covered by different types of forest. Many alpine species are endemic to Mount Kenya, such as the giant lobelias and senecios and a local subspecies of rock hyrax. An area of [tpl]convert|715|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] around the centre of the mountain was designated a National Park

[tpl]pp-move-indef[/tpl]

In the Zone is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Britney Spears. It was released in 2003 by Jive Records. Its music incorporates pop, dance, house and trip hop styles with instrumentation from guitars, drums, synthesizers, strings, and Middle Eastern musical instruments. Its themes range from love, dancing, empowerment, and in the case of songs such as "Touch of My Hand", sex and masturbation. Contributions to the album's production came from a wide range of producers, including Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Trixster, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix.
With the conclusion of the Dream Within a Dream Tour in July 2002 and the end of her relationship with Justin Timberlake, Spears planned to take a six-month break from her career; however, work for In the Zone began later that November. She began writing songs for the album while touring internationally, despite not knowing the direction of the album. She experimented with different producers, trying to find those with whom she had chemistry. The first song recorded was "Touch of My Hand", which Spears claims set the mood for the album. She co-wrote all but four tracks, and often changed the lyrics to suit herself. Spears stated she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point where she felt self-exploited. She also explained that the sexual nature of In the Zone was subconscious and happened while she was in the process of developing the album. Spears collaborated with artists such as Madonna in "Me Against the Music" and the Ying Yang Twins in "(I Got That) Boom Boom".
In the Zone received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its mix of different styles and Spears's songwriting, but criticized her vocals for being distant and processed. Commercially, In the Zone became an international success, debuting atop of the charts in France and the United States, and peaking inside the top ten in eleven countries. In the United States, she became the first female artist to have four consecutive number-one albums. In the Zone went on to become the eighth best selling album of 2003.
Four singles were released from the album: "Me Against the Music", "Toxic" and "Everytime" became worldwide hits, all peaking at number one in Australia and Ireland and reaching top five positions worldwide. To promote In the Zone, Spears performed the songs in a number of television appearances and also embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour. The album and its music videos are largely seen by critics as the end of her transition from teen pop star to a more adult female artist. In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed In the Zone as one of The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade, calling it "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s".

MusiquePlus is devoted to music and music related programming from various genres including pop, rock, RnB and focuses on a younger demographic than its sister station, MusiMax. It was the French language equivalent to MuchMusic (which is now owned and operated by Bell Media), and was once its sister station until it was purchased by Astral Media. Due to the difference of programming from MuchMusic over the year, MusiquePlus look more of an French equivalent to the Canadian MTV (in reality series programming) and E! channels than MuchMusic (except for the similar music programmings and acquired specials programmings).
The channel has only discretionary status outside of Quebec, meaning that cable companies may choose to offer it if there is a sufficient local audience for French programming, but are not required to do so. Within Quebec, however, the channel has mandatory cable carriage rights.

Point-to-multipoint is often abbreviated as P2MP, PTMP, or PMP.
Point-to-multipoint telecommunications is most typically (2003) used in wireless Internet and IP telephony via gigahertz radio frequencies. P2MP systems have been designed both as single and bi-directional systems. A central antenna or antenna array broadcasts to several receiving antennas and the system uses a form of time-division multiplexing to allow for the back-channel traffic.

[[Germline]]
CATEGORIES: Developmental biology

In biology and genetics, the germline of a mature or developing individual is the line (sequence) of germ cells that have genetic material that may be passed to a child.
For example, gametes such as the sperm or the egg are part of the germline. So are the cells that divide to produce the gametes, called gametocytes, the cells that produce those, called gametogonia, and all the way back to the zygote, the cell from which the individual developed.
Cells that are not in the germline are called somatic cells. This refers to all of the cells of body apart from the gametes. If there is a mutation or other genetic change in the germline, it can potentially be passed to offspring, but a change in a somatic cell will not be.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Mutation. ed. E.Monosson and C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC
Germline cells are immortal, in the sense that they have reproduced indefinitely since the beginning of life. This is largely due to the activity of the enzyme known as telomerase. This enzyme extends the telomeres of the chromosome, preventing chromosome fusions and other negative effects of shortened telomeres. Most somatic cells, by comparison, can only divide around 30-50 times according to the Hayflick limit. Certain somatic cells, known as stem cells, also express telomerase and are potentially immortal.Watt, F. M. and B. L. M. Hogan.  2000 Out of Eden: Stem Cells and Their Niches Science 287:1427-1430.
At present, determining the composition of germline DNA involves extracting DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (as these cells are the least likely to have undergone transformation (genetics)). This germline DNA can then be compared with DNA from other sites (e.g. a tumour) to determine acquired somatic DNA mutations[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl].
Not all multicellular organisms differentiate cells into somatic and germ lines. Notably, plants have no germline cells separate from stem cells[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl].
Germline can refer to a lineage of cells spanning many generations of individuals—for example, the germline that links any living individual to the hypothetical first eukaryote of about 2 billion years ago, from which all plants and animals descend.
Extensive research on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has identified RNA-binding protein as essential factors during germline development.

The province was formed from the northern region of Transvaal Province in 1994, and initially named Northern Transvaal. The following year, it was renamed Northern Province, which remained the name until 2003, when the name of the province was formally changed to the name of its most important river–on the border with Zimbabwe and Botswana–after deliberation by the provincial government and amendment of the Constitution. A notable consideration for the name was Mapungubwe, the area where the most ancient gold-using civilisation of the province was discovered a few years earlier.

CATEGORIES: Computer folklore, Computer programming

In computer programming, deep magic refers to techniques that are not widely known, and may be deliberately kept secret. The number of such techniques has arguably decreased in recent years, especially in the field of cryptography, many aspects of which are now open to public scrutiny. 
The Jargon File makes a distinction between deep magic, which refers to (code based on) esoteric theoretical knowledge; black magic, which refers to (code based on) techniques that appear to work but which lack a theoretical explanation; and heavy wizardry, which refers to (code based on) obscure or undocumented intricacies of particular hardware or software. All three terms can appear in source code comments of the form:

Amanda Leigh "Mandy" Moore (born April 10, 1984) is an American singer–songwriter, actress, and fashion designer. Raised in Florida, Moore first came to prominence with her 1999 debut single, "Candy", which peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Her subsequent album, So Real, went on to receive a Platinum certification from the RIAA. Two more singles, "Walk Me Home" and "So Real", were released but failed to have the success of their predecessor. Her 2000 single, "I Wanna Be with You", became her first Top 40 hit in the US, peaking at number 24 on the Hot 100 chart. The parent album, titled the same, was released that same year to generally mixed reviews. The album went on to achieve Gold certification. After revealing her displeasure with her early works, Moore's third album, simply titled Mandy Moore, featured a change of sound that drifted away from her "bubblegum pop" roots. The album spawned the single "In My Pocket", which became her third Top 20 hit in Australia. The album itself was her final album to be certified by the RIAA, receiving a Gold certification.
In 2003, Moore released her fourth studio album, Coverage, featuring covers of classic 1970s songs. Following the album's release, Moore parted ways with her record label, due to creative differences. The split prompted the label to release the compilation albums The Best of Mandy Moore and Candy, both of which have sold an estimated 100,000 copies to date. Moore did not return to music until the release of her 2007 album Wild Hope, which failed to have much success. To date, the album has sold an estimated 200,000 copies, and failed to receive an RIAA certification. Similarly, both of the album's singles failed to chart worldwide. In 2009, Moore released her sixth studio album, Amanda Leigh, which peaked at number 25 on the Billboard 200 and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. In 2012, Moore confirmed that she was working on her seventh studio album, currently slated for a 2014 release. As of 2009, Moore has sold more than 12.5 million albums worldwide, according to Billboard.[tpl]cite web|url=http://login.vnuemedia.com/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003980937 |title=Ask Billboard: The Black Eyed Peas, Linkin Park, Mandy Moore |publisher=Login.vnuemedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-15[/tpl]  In 2012, Moore was ranked #96 on VH1's list of "100 Greatest Women in Music",[tpl]cite web|last=Graham |first=Mark |url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-02-13/vh1s-100-greatest-women-in-music-complete-list/ |title=The 100 Greatest Women In Music | VH1 Tuner | Music News + Gossip |publisher=Vh1.com |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2013-07-02[/tpl] as well as #63 on their Sexiest Artists of All Time List.[tpl]cite web|author=Bené Viera |url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-03-05/vh1-100-sexiest-artists-complete-list/39/ |title=VH1′s 100 Sexiest Artists List | VH1 Tuner | Music News + Gossip |publisher=Vh1.com |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2013-07-02[/tpl]
Aside from her musical career, Moore has also branched out into acting. She made her film debut in the 2001 film Dr. Dolittle 2, though it was only a minor voice role. Later that year, she appeared as Lana in the comedy film The Princess Diaries, alongside Anne Hathaway. She had her first starring role in the 2002 romantic film A Walk to Remember, which was based on the Nicholas Sparks book. Between 2003 and 2006, Moore appeared in various films, including Chasing Liberty, Saved!, and How to Deal. She later appeared in the 2006 film American Dreamz, which was both a critical and financial failure. The film failed to make back its $17 million budget, and debuted at number 9 at the box office. The following year, Moore appeared in the romantic comedy Because I Said So, alongside Diane Keaton. The film was negatively received by critics, but was a financial success, earning over $69 million worldwide at the box office. In 2010, Moore portrayed Rapunzel in the animated film Tangled, in which she performed the song "I See the Light"; the song won a Grammy Best Song Written for Visual Media.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/complete_list_of_nominees_54th_annual/277725 |title= Complete List of Nominees for the 54th Annual Grammy Awards[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-env-grammy-nominees-2011-list,0,4670613.htmlstory |title= Grammys: 54th Grammy Awards nominees | work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl]

[[Ashikaga clan]]

CATEGORIES: Minamoto clan, Ashikaga clan

The [tpl]nihongo|Ashikaga clan|足利氏|Ashikaga-shi[/tpl] was a prominent Japanese samurai clan which established the Muromachi shogunate and ruled Japan from roughly 1336 to 1573.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Ashikaga" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia, pp. 53-57|page=53[/tpl]; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, see Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File. 
The Ashikaga were descended from a branch of the Minamoto clan, deriving originally from the town of Ashikaga in Shimotsuke province (modern-day Tochigi prefecture).
For about a century the clan was divided in two rival branches, the Kantō Ashikaga, who ruled from Kamakura, and the Kyōto Ashikaga, rulers of Japan. The rivalry ended with the defeat of the first in 1439. The clan had many notable branch clans, including the Hosokawa,[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Imagawa,[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Hatakeyama[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] (after 1205), Kira [tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] , Shiba,[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] and Hachisuka clans.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] After the head family of the Minamoto clan died out during the early Kamakura period, the Ashikaga came to style themselves as the head of the Minamoto, coopting the prestige which came with that name.
Another Ashikaga clan, not related by blood, and derived instead from the Fujiwara clan, also existed.

[[Latin dance]]
CATEGORIES: Latin dances

Latin dance is a general label, and a term in partner dance competition jargon. It refers to types of ballroom dance and folk dance, and includes a wide range of dances originating in Latin America, Cuba and Puerto Rico.
The category of Latin dances in the international dancesport competitions consists of the cha-cha-cha, rumba, samba, paso doble, and also the jive of United States origin.Lavelle, Doris 1983. Latin & American dances. 3rd ed, Black, London, p108.The reason jive is included with the latin dances is because its dance style is similar: "... a non-progressive dance which can be danced in a small space when the floor is crowded". and "The hold is similar to latin dances" it is quite different from the modern or ballroom dances. Silvester, Victor 1977. Dancing: ballroom, latin-american and social, 105/6. ISBN 0-340-22517-3. Teach Yourself Books
Social Latin dances include salsa, mambo, merengue, tumba, bachata, bomba, plena, and the Argentine tango. There are many dances which were popular in the first part of the 20th century, but which are now of only historical interest. The Cuban danzón is a good example.Santos, John. 1982. The Cuban Danzón (liner notes). New York, Folkways Records FE 4066
Perreo is a Puerto Rican dance associated with Reggaeton music with Jamaican and Caribbean influences. Latin folk dances of Argentina include the chacarera, gato, escondido and zamba. Typical Bolivian folk dances are the morenada, kullawada, caporales and the recently created tinku.

CATEGORIES: Arrays, Programming language topics

In computer programming, rank with no further specifications is usually a synonym for (or refers to) "number of dimensions"; thus, a bi-dimensional array has rank two, a three-dimensional array has rank three and so on.
Strictly, no formal definition can be provided which applies to every programming language, since each of them has its own concepts, semantics and terminology; the term may not even be applicable or, to the contrary, applied with a very specific meaning in the context of a given language.
In the case of APL the notion applies to every operand; and dyads ("binary functions") have a left rank and a right rank.
The box below instead shows how rank of a type and rank of an array expression could be defined (in a semi-formal style) for C++ and illustrates a simple way to calculate them at compile time.

Pumori ([tpl]lang-ne|पुमोरि[/tpl]) (or Pumo Ri) is a mountain on the Nepal-Tibet border in the Mahalangur section of the Himalaya. Pumori lies just eight kilometres west of Mount Everest. Pumori, which means "Unmarried Daughter" in the Sherpa language, was named by George Mallory. Climbers sometimes refer to Pumori as "Everest's Daughter".
Pumori is a popular climbing peak and the easiest route is graded class 3, although with significant avalanche danger. Pumori was first climbed  in 1962 by Gerhard Lenser on a German-Swiss expedition. Two Czechs (Leopold Sulovský and Zdeněk Michalec) climbed a new route on the south face in the spring of 1996 (Joe Simpson, 1997, Dark Shadows falling).
An outlier of Pumori is Kala Patthar (5,643m/18,513'), which appears as a big brown bump below the impressive south face of Pumori. Many trekkers going to see Mount Everest up close will attempt to climb to the top of Kala Patthar.

[[Dope vector]]
CATEGORIES: Arrays

In computer programming, a dope vector is a data structure used to hold information about a data object,Pratt T. and M. Zelkowitz, Programming Languages: Design and Implementation (Third Edition), Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, (1996) pp 114 e.g. an array, especially its memory layout. 
A dope vector typically contains information about the type of array element, rank of an array, the extents of an array, and the stride of an array as well as a pointer to the block in memory containing the array elements.
It is often used in compilers to pass entire arrays between procedures in a high level language like Fortran. 
The dope vector includes an identifier, a length, a parent address, and a next child address.  The identifier was an assigned name and was mostly useless, but the length was the amount of allocated storage to this vector from the end of the dope vector that contained data of use to the internal processes of the computer. This length by many was called the offset, span of vector length. The parent and child references were absolute core references, or register and offset settings to the parent or child depending on the type of computer.  
Dope vectors were managed internally by the operating system and allowed the processor to allocate and de-allocate storage in specific segments as needed.
Later dope vectors had a status bit that told the system if they were active; if it was not active it would be reallocated when needed. Using this technology the computer could perform a more granular memory management.

[[Wear]]
CATEGORIES: Materials degradation, Tribology

In materials science, wear is erosion or sideways displacement of material from its "derivative" and original position on a solid surface performed by the action of another surface. 
Wear is related to interactions between surfaces and more specifically the removal and deformation of material on a surface as a result of mechanical action of the opposite surface. The need for relative motion between two surfaces and initial mechanical contact between asperities is an important distinction between mechanical wear compared to other processes with similar outcomes.Williams, J. A. (2005). "Wear and wear particles - Some fundamentals." Tribology International 38(10): 863-870
The definition of wear may include loss of dimension from plastic deformation if it is originated at the interface between two sliding surfaces.
However, plastic deformation such as yield stress is excluded from the wear definition if it doesn't incorporates a relative sliding motion and contact against another surface despite the possibility for material removal, because it then lacks the relative sliding action of another surface.
Impact wear is in reality a short sliding motion where two solid bodies interact at an exceptional short time interval. Previously due to the fast execution, the contact found in impact wear was referred to as an impulse contact by the nomenclature. Impulse can be described as a mathematical model of a synthesised average on the energy transport between two travelling solids in opposite converging contact. 
Cavitation wear is a form of wear where the erosive medium or counter-body is a fluid.
Corrosion may be included in wear phenomenons, but the damage is amplified and performed by chemical reactions rather than mechanical action.
Wear can also be defined as a process where interaction between two surfaces or bounding faces of solids within the working environment results in dimensional loss of one solid, with or without any actual decoupling and loss of material. Aspects of the working environment which affect wear include loads and features such as unidirectional sliding, reciprocating, rolling, and impact loads, speed, temperature, but also different types of counter-bodies such as solid, liquid or gas and type of contact ranging between single phase or multiphase, in which the last multiphase may combine liquid with solid particles and gas bubbles.

[[Intein]]

CATEGORIES: Proteins, Molecular genetics, Protein biosynthesis

An intein is a segment of a protein that is able to excise itself and join the remaining portions (the exteins) with a peptide bond in a process termed protein splicing. Inteins have also been called "protein introns".[tpl]cite journal |author=Anraku Y, Mizutani R, Satow Y |title=Protein splicing: its discovery and structural insight into novel chemical mechanisms |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=563–74 |year=2005 |pmid=16118114 |doi=10.1080/15216540500215499[/tpl]
Intein-mediated protein splicing occurs after the intein-containing mRNA has been translated into a protein. This precursor protein contains three segments — an N-extein followed by the intein followed by a C-extein. After splicing has taken place, the resulting protein contains the N-extein linked to the C-extein; this splicing product is also termed an extein.

[[Stride of an array]]
CATEGORIES: Arrays, Articles with example C code

In computer programming, the stride of an array (also referred to as increment, pitch or step size) refers to the number of locations in memory between beginnings of successive array elements, measured in bytes or in units of the size of the array's elements. In other words: stride is the number of bytes one has to move to get from one element to the next (or previous) one.
Stride cannot be smaller than element size (it would mean that elements are overlapping) but can be larger (indicating extra space between elements).
An array with stride of exactly the same size as the size of each of its elements is contiguous in memory. Such arrays are sometimes said to have unit stride. Unit stride arrays are sometimes more efficient than non-unit stride arrays, while non-unit stride arrays are sometimes more efficient than unit stride arrays, particularly for 2D or multi-dimensional arrays, depending on the effects of caching and the access patterns used. This can be attributed to the Principle of Locality, specifically spatial locality.

The main peak, Nuptse I, was first climbed on May 16, 1961 by Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi, members of a British expedition. After a long hiatus, Nuptse again became the objective of high-standard mountaineers in the 1990s and 2000s, with important routes being put up on its west, south, and north faces.
While Nuptse is a dramatic peak when viewed from the south or west, and it towers above the base camp for the standard south col route on Everest, it is not a particularly independent peak: its topographic prominence is only [tpl]convert|319|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Hence it is not ranked on the list of highest mountains.

The [tpl]Nihongo|Jidai Matsuri|時代祭り|extra2=Festival of the Ages[/tpl] is a traditional Japanese festival (also called the matsuri) held on October 22 annually in Kyoto, Japan. It is one of Kyoto's renowned three great festivals, with the other two being the Aoi Matsuri, held annually on May 15, and the Gion Matsuri, which is held annually from 17 to July 24.[tpl]cite web|title=Kyoto Jidai Matsuri|accessdate=2009-01-19|publisher=Japan Atlas|url=http://web-japan.org/atlas/festivals/fes15.html[/tpl] It is a festival enjoyed by people of all ages, participating in its historical reenactment parade dressed in authentic costumes representing various periods, and characters in Japanese feudal history.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morton|first=Don|title=Old fashions: a proud parade of period costumes brings Japanese history to life at Jidai Matsuri|journal=Gain: Hitachi electronic component news|publisher=Hitachi Inc.|location=Tokyo, Japan|volume=16|issue=4|date=Nov 1997|pages=2–3[/tpl]
Jidai Matsuri traces its roots with the relocation of the Japanese capital to Tokyo in 1868. This involved the relocation of the Emperor of Japan and his imperial family, the Imperial Palace and thousands of government officials and subjects to the city. Fearing for Kyoto's loss in glory and interest by her people, the city government and the Kyoto Prefectural Government commemorated the 1100th anniversary of the founding of Heian-kyō (平安京) which was the former name of Kyoto, in 794 by [tpl]nihongo|Emperor Kammu|桓武天皇|Kanmu-tennō[/tpl] (737 - 806). To inaugurate the first Jidai celebration in 1895, the city government built the [tpl]nihongo|Heian Shrine|平安神宮|Heian jingū[/tpl] to enshrine the spirit of Emperor Kanmu. To add meaning to the festival, it staged a costume procession representing people of each era in Kyoto history. In 1940, the local government decided that on top of honouring Emperor Kammu, the Jidai festival was also to be held in honour of [tpl]nihongo|Emperor Kōmei|孝明天皇|Kōmei-tennō[/tpl] (July 22, 1831 - January 30, 1867) for his work in unifying the country, the power of the imperial court and the affirmation of Kyoto as the center of Japan at the decline of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Edo Era.
The Jidai Matsuri begins in early morning with the mikoshi (portable shrines) brought out of the Old Imperial Palace so that people may pay their respects.  The mikoshi represent emperors Kanmu and Kōmei, respectively. The five-hour, two-kilometer costume procession begins in the afternoon, with approximately 2,000 performers dressed as samurai, military figures, and common people, from the earliest eras to the Meiji era  These are followed by Japanese women who are dressed in elaborate [tpl]nihongo|jūnihitoe|十二単衣|juunihitoe[/tpl]. And, finally, the mikoshi are carried from the palace and are accompanied by a costumed military band that is playing the gagaku. The procession ends at the Heian Shrine.

The Bojinka plot ([tpl]lang-ar|بجنكة[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-tl|Oplan Bojinka[/tpl]) was a planned large-scale three phase Islamist attack by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed[tpl]when|date=December 2013[/tpl].

Despite his careful planning and the skill of Ramzi Yousef, the Bojinka plot was disrupted after a chemical fire drew the Philippine National Police's (PNP) attention on January 6–7, 1995. Before the plot was disrupted, Yousef detonated test bombs in a mall and theater, injuring scores of people, as well as Philippine Airlines Flight 434, killing one person and nearly causing enough damage to result in the destruction of the aircraft.

The Peace Arch is a monument situated on the Canada – United States border between the communities of Blaine, Washington and Surrey, British Columbia. The Peace Arch, which stands
[tpl]convert|20.5|m[/tpl] tall, was built by Sam Hill and dedicated in September 1921, and commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in 1814. The monument is built on the exact United States – Canada boundary, between Interstate 5 and Highway 99, in the grass median between the northbound and southbound lanes. The Peace Arch has the flags of the U.S. and Canada mounted on its crown, and two inscriptions on both sides of its frieze. The inscription on the U.S. side of the Peace Arch reads "Children of a common mother", and the words on the Canadian side read "Brethren dwelling together in unity".  Within the arch, each side has an iron gate hinged on either side of the border with an inscription above reading "May these gates never be closed". 
Peace Arch Park consists of Peace Arch Provincial Park on the Canadian side and Peace Arch State Park on the American side of the border.  Within the park is a major border crossing (between Interstate 5 on the U.S. side and British Columbia Highway 99 on the Canadian side) which has never closed, symbolizing a long history of peace between the two nations. In Canada, the crossing is officially named Douglas in honour of Sir James Douglas, the first governor of the Colony of British Columbia. Because of the Peace Arch monument, however, the border crossing between Surrey and Blaine is popularly known as the "Peace Arch Border Crossing", one of the busiest border crossings between Canada and the United States. It is the busiest such crossing west of Detroit.
The monument and surrounding park is considered an international park. As such, visitors do not require either a passport or visa to pass through their applicable border crossing so long as they stay within the boundaries of the park.About Peace Arch Park

[[Colleges of the University of Oxford]]

CATEGORIES: Colleges of the University of Oxford

The University of Oxford has 38 Colleges and 6 Permanent Private Halls (PPHs) of religious foundation. Colleges and PPHs are autonomous self-governing corporations within the university, and all teaching staff and students studying for a degree at the university must belong to one of the colleges or PPHs. These colleges are not only houses of residence, but have substantial responsibility for student teaching. Generally tutorials (one of the main methods of teaching in Oxford) and classes are the responsibility of colleges, while lectures, examinations, laboratories and the central library are run by the university. Most colleges take both graduates and undergraduates, but several are for graduates only.
Undergraduate and graduate students may name preferred colleges in their applications. For undergraduate students, an increasing number of departments practise reallocation to ensure that the ratios between potential students and subject places available at each college are as uniform as possible. For the Department of Physics, reallocation is done on a random basis after a shortlist of candidates is drawn upon and before candidates are invited for interviews at the university.http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/admissions/FAQs08.pdf
For graduate students, many colleges express a preference for candidates who plan to undertake research in an area of interest of one of its fellows. St Hugh's College, for example, states that it accepts graduate students in most subjects, principally those in the fields of interest of the Fellows of the college.St Hugh's College : Oxford University Graduate Studies Prospectus 2008/09
A typical college consists of a hall for dining, a chapel, a library, a college bar, senior, middle (postgraduate) and junior common rooms, rooms for 200–400 undergraduates as well as lodgings for the head of the college and other dons. College buildings range from the medieval to modern buildings, but most are made up of interlinked quadrangles (courtyards), with a lodge controlling entry from the outside.
2008 saw the first modern merger of colleges, with Green College and Templeton College merging to form Green Templeton College. This reduced the number of Colleges of the University from 39 to 38.http://www.gtc.ox.ac.uk/ The number of PPHs also reduced in 2008, when Greyfriars closed down.http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2007/251007.html

Major-General Sir Newton James Moore KCMG (17 May 1870 – 28 October 1936), was the eighth Premier of Western Australia and a member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1918 to 1932.
Newton Moore was born in Fremantle, Western Australia, son of James Moore, auctioneer and later mayor of Bunbury, and Elizabeth Dawson, schoolteacher.  He was educated at Arthur Street Primary School in Bunbury before attending Prince Alfred College in Adelaide, South Australia.  In 1886 he was apprenticed as a surveyor to Alexander Forrest.  After qualifying in 1894, he worked as a contract surveyor in and around the Bunbury area.  In April 1898 he married Isabella Lowrie, sister of William Lowrie.
In 1899 Moore was elected to the Bunbury Municipal Council, and was Mayor of Bunbury from 1900 to 1904.  In 1903 he was also a member of the Royal Commission on Forestry, and during 1904 and 1905 he was President of the Municipal Association of Western Australia.
Moore was also involved in the Western Australian militia, commencing a long career as a private with the BRV (Bunbury Rifle Volunteers) in 1894. By 1900 he had risen to captain and was instrumental in assisting in the formation of the BVR Mounted Infantry Section, which was later incorporated into the WAMI (Western Australian Mounted Infantry). After the Commonwealth reorganisation of 1903, the unit was renamed the 18th (WAMI) Australian Light Horse. Moore served as acting commander until 1908, when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and officially appointed the commanding officer. In August 1908, Moore was appointed commanding officer of the 5th Military District Intelligence Section, where he remained until March 1914.
In 1901, Moore contested the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Bunbury, but was unsuccessful.  In 1904 he contested the seat again and won.  In August 1905, he was appointed Minister for Lands and Agriculture in Cornthwaite Rason's government.  On Rason's resignation on 7 May 1906, he became Premier of Western Australia.  Just 36 years old, he was at the time the youngest ever Premier.  He remains the most inexperienced politician ever to hold the office, having served in Parliament for less than two years at the time of his appointment.
Moore's emphasis as Premier was on agricultural development.  He personally retained the Lands and Agriculture portfolio, and pursued a policy of cheap land for settlers.  His government laid the foundations of the Wheatbelt, and brought the state into line with the rest of Australia through an Income and Land tax, despite opposition from the conservative Legislative Council.
In September 1907, after a dispute with the Legislative Council, Moore resigned as Premier.  However, Governor Bedford would not accept his resignation, nor would he consent to an early dissolution, so Moore resumed office.  In 1908, Moore led the Liberal Party to another election victory.  As the state had previously seen nine Premiers in a little over five years, this was a welcome respite from a period of great instability.  Moore was Minister for Justice from 14 May 1909 until 30 June 1909, when he relinquished both the Agriculture and Lands portfolio and the Justice portfolio, and took up the office of Colonial Treasurer.  On 16 September 1910, Moore resigned as Premier and Colonial Treasurer on the grounds of ill health.
Moore was made CMG in June 1908, and KCMG in June 1910.  In February 1911, he resigned his Bunbury seat to take up the office of Agent-General for Western Australia in London.  In 1915, while still Agent-General, the Australian government appointed him General Officer Commanding Australian Imperial Forces in the United Kingdom.  He held that position until 1917, during which time he was promoted to the rank of major-general.
In 1918, Moore resigned as Agent-General after being invited by the Conservative Party to stand for the British House of Commons seat of St George's, Hanover Square, which had been made vacant by the death of former Prime Minister of Australia George Reid.  He was elected to the seat on 4 October 1918.  In the 1918 general election on 14 December he instead stood for and won the seat of Islington North.  After a break from politics in 1923 and 1924, he won the seat of Richmond upon Thames in the general election of 29 October 1924, and held it until his resignation on 13 April 1932.  For ten years, he was Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Commons.  He established himself as an excellent representative of Australia, and his opinion on Empire matters was highly valued by British ministers.
After retiring from politics, Moore became President of the British Empire Steel Corporation, a company with interests in Western Australia and Canada.  He was also a director of several important companies.  He died on 28 October 1936 at a nursing home in London, following surgery.
Newton Moore Senior High School in Bunbury is named after him.

[[Elephantine papyri]]
CATEGORIES: Jewish manuscripts, Papyrus, Ancient Jewish Egyptian history, Jewish texts in Aramaic, Archaeological corpora

The Elephantine Papyri are a collection of ancient Jewish manuscripts dating from the 5th century BC. They come from a Jewish community at Elephantine, then called Yeb, the island in the Nile at the border of Nubia, which was probably founded as a military installation in about 650 BC during Manasseh's reign to assist Pharaoh Psammetichus I in his Nubian campaign. The dry soil of Upper Egypt preserved documents from the Egyptian border fortresses of Elephantine and Syene (Aswan).  Hundreds of these Elephantine papyri, written in hieratic and Demotic Egyptian, Aramaic, Greek, Latin and Coptic, span a period of 1000 years. Legal documents and a cache of letters survived, turned up on the local 'gray market' of antiquities starting in the late 19th century, and were scattered into several Western collections.
Though some fragments on papyrus are much older, the largest number of papyri are written in Aramaic, the lingua franca of the Persian Empire, and document the Jewish community among soldiers stationed at Elephantine under Persian rule, 495-399 BCE. The Elephantine documents include letters and legal contracts from family and other archives: divorce documents, the manumission of slaves, and other business, and are  a valuable source of knowledge about law, society, religion, language and onomastics, the sometimes surprisingly revealing study of names.
The 'Passover letter' of 419 BCE (discovered in 1907), which gives detailed instructions for properly keeping the passover is in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.
Further Elephantine papyri are at the Brooklyn Museum. The discovery of the Brooklyn papyri is a remarkable story itself. The documents were first acquired in 1893 by New York journalist Charles Edwin Wilbour. After lying in a warehouse for more than 50 years, the papyri were shipped to the Egyptian Department of the Brooklyn Museum. It was at this time that scholars finally realized that "Wilbour had acquired the first Elephantine papyri".

[[Pontryagin duality]]
CATEGORIES: Topological groups, Harmonic analysis, Duality theories, Theorems in analysis, Fourier analysis

In mathematics, specifically in harmonic analysis and the theory of topological groups, Pontryagin duality explains the general properties of the Fourier transform on locally compact groups, such as R, the circle, or finite cyclic groups. The Pontryagin duality theorem itself states that locally compact groups identify naturally with their bidual.
The subject is named after Lev Semenovich Pontryagin who laid down the foundations for the theory of locally compact abelian groups and their duality during his early mathematical works in 1934. Pontryagin's treatment relied on the group being second-countable and either compact or discrete. This was improved to cover the general locally compact abelian groups by Egbert van Kampen in 1935 and André Weil in 1940.

[[List of Oxbridge sister colleges]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of universities and colleges in the United Kingdom, Oxbridge, Colleges of the University of Oxford, Colleges of the University of Cambridge, University of Cambridge-related lists, University of Oxford-related lists

Most of the colleges forming the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford are paired into sister colleges across the two universities.Oxford & Cambridge College Alliances - Queens' College, Cambridge The extent of the arrangement differs from case to case, but commonly includes the right to dine at one's sister college, the right to book accommodation there, the holding of joint events between JCRs and invitations to May balls. 
Most of the pairings reflect similarities between the two colleges concerned, often parallel histories. For example, University College, Oxford (an ancient and prestigious college, founded 1249) is paired with Trinity Hall, Cambridge (of equivalent reputation, founded 1350). William Wykeham's statutes for New College, Oxford, founded in 1379, formed the basis of the foundation of its sister college, King's College, Cambridge. The two Colleges both share distinguished choral reputations.Links between New College, Oxford and King's College, Cambridge Founded by scholars from Merton College, one of Oxford's oldest colleges (founded 1264), Peterhouse (Cambridge, 1284) is Cambridge's first college. Similarly, Somerville College, Oxford (founded in 1879 as a women's institution) has Girton College, Cambridge (also historically a women's college, founded 1869) as its sister college. St Catherine's College, Oxford (the most recent undergraduate college in Oxford, founded 1963) is paired with Robinson College, Cambridge (the newest Cambridge college, founded 1977).
Oriel College, Oxford and St John's College, Cambridge also have sister college links with Trinity College, Dublin. 
Oriel College and St Hugh's College, Oxford currently each dispute the other's claim to sister college status with Clare College, Cambridge.Sibling rivalry hits Oxford colleges  While Oriel and Clare both share a common founding year of 1326 and a long history of association, in the 1980s, the now co-ed Clare associated with the then female-only St. Hugh's, in order to protest against Oriel remaining all-male.  Today both St. Hugh's and Oriel are co-ed colleges.

The Triple Alliance was a treaty between the Dutch Republic, France and Great Britain, against Spain, attempting to maintain the agreement of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The three states were concerned about Spain becoming a superpower in Europe. As a result of this militarisation took place, causing great havoc to civilians. This enraged Spain and other states, leading to brinkmanship. It became the Quadruple Alliance the next year with the accession of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.

[[Mesoplodont whale]]

CATEGORIES: Ziphiids

Mesoplodont whales are fourteen species of whale in the genus Mesoplodon, making it the largest genus in the cetacean order. Two species were described as recently as 1991 (pygmy beaked whale) and 2002 (Perrin's beaked whale), and marine biologists predict the discovery of more species in the future. They are the most poorly known group of large mammals. The word mesoplodon comes from the Greek meso- (middle) - hopla (arms) - odon (teeth), and may be translated as 'armed with a tooth in the centre of the jaw'.

CATEGORIES: Hawks, Buteo, Birds of North America, Birds of Central America, Birds of South America, Birds of Argentina, Birds of Trinidad and Tobago, Animals described in 1838

Swainson's Hawk (Buteo swainsoni), is a large Buteo hawk of the Falconiformes, sometimes separated in the Accipitriformes like its relatives. This species was named after William Swainson, a British naturalist. It is colloquially known as the Grasshopper Hawk or Locust Hawk, as it is very fond of Acrididae (locusts and grasshoppers) and will voraciously eat these insects whenever they are available.
Their breeding habitat is prairie and dry grasslands in western North America. They build a stick nest in a tree or shrub or on a cliff edge. This species is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Argentina; there is a single record of a vagrant from Norway[tpl]clarify|date=April 2012[/tpl].
This species or its immediate predecessor is the ancestor of the Galápagos Hawk, as demonstrated by recent research. The latter diverged from the mainland birds perhaps 300,000 years ago, a very short time in evolution.

Sowerby's beaked whale (Mesoplodon bidens), also known as the North Atlantic/North Sea beaked whale, was the first mesoplodont whale to be described. James Sowerby, an English naturalist and artist, first described the species in 1804 from a skull obtained from a male that had stranded in the Moray Firth, Scotland, in 1800. He named it bidens, which derives from the two teeth present in the jaw, now known to be a very common feature among the genus.Sharks and Whales (Carwardine et al. 2002), p. 358.

[[Mainland Japan]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Japan

[tpl]nihongo|Mainland Japan|内地|naichi|lit. "inner lands"[/tpl] is a term to distinguish the area of Japan from its outlying territories. It was an official term in the pre-war period, distinguishing Japan and the colonies in East Asia. After the end of World War II, the term became uncommon, but still is used as an unofficial term to distinguish the area of Japan from Okinawa or Hokkaidō.
The literal Japanese meaning might best be translated as inner Japan or inner lands.  The term "mainland" is an inaccurate translation because mainland is usually the continental part of a region, as opposed to the islands.
It is also somewhat confusing as Mainland Japan is defined to consist of several major islands (Hokkaidō, Honshū, Kyūshū, Shikoku) and many minor ones.  The term mainland Japan is also sometimes used to translate Honshū, the largest island, though naichi not.

[[Villanella]]
CATEGORIES: Renaissance music, Baroque music, Italian music history, Western classical music styles

In music, a villanella (plural villanelle — not to be confused with the French poetic form villanelle) is a form of light Italian secular vocal music which originated in Italy just before the middle of the 16th century.  It first appeared in Naples, and influenced the later canzonetta, and from there also influenced the madrigal.
The subject matter is generally rustic, comic, and often satirical; frequently the mannerisms of art music, such as the madrigal, are a subject of parody.  The rhyme scheme of the verse in the earlier Neapolitan forms of the villanelle is usually abR abR abR ccR.  The villanelle became one of the most popular forms of song in Italy around mid-century.
The music of the early villanella (known as the canzone villanesca) is invariably for three unaccompanied voices.  The first composers of villanellas were the Neapolitans Giovanni Domenico da Nola and Giovan Tomaso di Maio; later composers of villanellas, no longer from Naples, included Adrian Willaert, Luca Marenzio, Adriano Banchieri, Orlande de Lassus, Eva Dell'Acqua and others.

CATEGORIES: Lambda calculus, Logic in computer science, Theory of computation, Type theory

Typed lambda calculi are foundational programming languages and are the base of typed functional programming languages such as ML and Haskell and, more indirectly, typed imperative programming languages. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of type systems for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.
Typed lambda calculi are closely related to mathematical logic and proof theory via the Curry–Howard isomorphism and they can be considered as the internal language of classes of categories, e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of Cartesian closed categories (CCCs).

Charles Reznikoff (August 31, 1894 – January 22, 1976) was an American poet known for his long work, Testimony: The United States (1885-1915), Recitative (1934-1979). The term Objectivist was first coined for him. The two-volume Testimony was based on court records and explored the black experience in the United States. He followed this with Holocaust (1975), based on court testimony about Nazi death camps during World War II.
When Louis Zukofsky was asked by Harriet Monroe to provide an introduction to what became known as the Objectivist issue of Poetry, he contributed his  essay, Sincerity and Objectification: With Special Reference to the Work of Charles Reznikoff. This established the name of the loose-knit group of 2nd generation modernist poets and the two characteristics of their poetry: sincerity and objectification.

The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB; [tpl]Lang-ga|Bráithreachas Phoblacht na hÉireann, BPÉ[/tpl]) was a secret oath-bound fraternal organisation dedicated to the establishment of an "independent democratic republic" in Ireland between 1858 and 1924.McGee, p. 15. Its counterpart in the United States of America was organised by John O'Mahony and became known as the Fenian Brotherhood (later Clan na Gael). The members of both wings of the movement are often referred to as "Fenians". The IRB played an important role in the history of Ireland, as the chief advocate of republicanism during the campaign for Ireland's independence from the United Kingdom, successor to movements such as the United Irishmen of the 1790s and the Young Irelanders of the 1840s.
As part of the New Departure of the 1870s–80s, IRB members attempted to democratise the Home Rule League.In November 1873, the Home Government Association was reconstituted as the Home Rule League. As with the HGA, Butt was opposed to its membership having any power to dictate policy (cite, McGee, p. 47.). The Irish MPs at Westminster "felt total contempt" for the idea of promoting a radical "democratic movement" in Ireland (Ibid, p. 53.). Charles Doran secretary of the Supreme Council of the IRB, proposed that all MP's should be accountable before "a great national conference ... as to represent the opinions and feelings of the Irish nation" (Ibid, p. 48.). and its successor, the Irish Parliamentary Party, as well as taking part in the Land War.McGee, pp. 46–60. The IRB staged the Easter Rising in 1916, which led to the establishment of the first Dáil Éireann in 1919. The suppression of Dáil Éireann precipitated the Irish War of Independence and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Irish Free State, which excluded the territory of Northern Ireland.

[[Adjunct (grammar)]]
CATEGORIES: Syntactic entities

In linguistics, an adjunct is an optional, or structurally dispensable, part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that, if removed or discarded, will not otherwise affect the remainder of the sentence. Example: In John helped Bill in Central Park, the phrase in Central Park is an adjunct. See Lyons (1968). 
A more detailed definition of the adjunct emphasizes its attribute as a modifying form, word, or phrase that depends on another form, word, or phrase, being an element of clause structure with adverbial function.Dictionary.com: adjunct An adjunct is not an argument (nor is it a predicative expression), and an argument is not an adjunct. The argument-adjunct distinction is central in most theories of syntax and semantics. The terminology used to denote arguments and adjuncts can vary depending on the theory at hand. Some dependency grammars, for instance, employ the term circonstant (instead of adjunct), following Tesnière (1959).
The area of grammar that explores the nature of predicates, their arguments, and adjuncts is called valency theory. Predicates have valency; they determine the number and type of arguments that can or must appear in their environment. The valence of predicates is also investigated in terms of subcategorization.

The Pomeranians ([tpl]lang-de|Pomoranen[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-csb|Pòmòrzónie[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-pl|Pomorzanie[/tpl]) were a group of West Slavic tribes who lived along the shore of the Baltic Sea between the mouths of the Oder and Vistula Rivers (the latter Farther Pomerania and Pomerelia). They spoke the Pomeranian language belonging to the Lechitic branch of the West Slavic language family.
The name Pomerania comes from Slavic po more, which means Land at the Sea.Der Name Pommern (po more) ist slawischer Herkunft und bedeutet so viel wie „Land am Meer“. (Pommersches Landesmuseum, German)
The Pomeranian tribes formed after the 6th century, when as a result of the Slavic migration, groups of Slavs populated the area formerly inhabited by Germanic tribes, such as the Goths and the Rugians etc.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
From the late 10th century, the Piast dukes of Poland tried to incorporate the Pomeranians into their realm and they succeeded several times. The Pomeranians were nevertheless always able to regain their independence. In the course of the 12th century, the non-Christian Pomeranians faced continuous pressure from their expanding Christian neighbours Denmark, Poland, and the Saxon dukes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1121 they were again subdued by the Polish duke Bolesław III Wrymouth, who had Pomerania Christianized by the German missionary Otto of Bamberg.
At the same time the Pomeranian Prince Wartislaw I conquered the former Lutici lands west of the Oder. After his successors from the House of Griffins were defeated by the Saxons at the 1164 Battle of Verchen, they accepted the overlordship of Duke Henry the Lion. The Pomeranian lands were eventually divided, with the Western parts entering the Holy Roman Empire as the Duchy of Pomerania in 1181, and the Eastern part consisting of Pomerelia under the Samborides came under the influence of Poland and, from 1309 onwards, the Teutonic Order.
After the Germanization of Pomerania resulting from the medieval Ostsiedlung, many Pomeranians were slowly and gradually assimilated and discontinued the use of their Slavic language and culture. The direct descendants of Pomeranians include:

It originally formed one of a network of 18 Zone Switching Centres within the United Kingdom (UK) that provided trunk switching facilities within its own charge group and to Group Switching Centres (GSC) within an area broadly comprising the West Midlands and central Wales. The exchange formed part of the trunk mechanisation plan commenced in 1939 to permit operators from originating GSCs to dial through to a distant U.K. subscriber without requiring further operator intervention. Later, it was additionally used to switch subscriber dialled trunk calls after its introduction at Bristol in 1958. 
It was subsequently augmented and superseded by a Transit Switching Centre (TSC) equipped with a crossbar switching system (TXK4) which formed part of the Transit Network. It parented two of the first three GSCs at Worcester and Wolverhampton  to go-live when the transit network was inaugurated in 1971 which eventually provided universal U.K. automatic subscriber dialling and was completed in 1979.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1969to1980/1979.htm |title=Full UK Subscriber Dialling Completed (1979) |accessdate=8 September 2012[/tpl]

Gloriosa is a genus of 12 species in the plant family Colchicaceae, and include the formerly recognised genus Littonia. They are native in tropical and southern Africa to Asia, and naturalised in Australia and the Pacific as well as being widely cultivated. The most common English names are flame lily, fire lily, gloriosa lily, glory lily, superb lily, climbing lily, and creeping lily.
They are tender, tuberous rooted deciduous perennials, adapted to summer rainfall with a dormant dry season. All parts of the plant contain colchicine and related alkaloids and are therefore dangerously toxic if ingested, and contact with the stems and leaves can cause skin irritation. Various preparations of the plant are used in traditional medicines for a variety of complaints in both Africa and India. In Indian language of Telugu, in the state of Andhra Pradesh it is called Naabhi and was used in traditional medicine.

Jervis served throughout the latter half of the 18th century and into the 19th, and was an active commander during the Seven Years' War, American War of Independence, French Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars. He is best known for his victory at the 1797 Battle of Cape Saint Vincent, from which he earned his titles, and as a patron of Horatio Nelson.Mahan Vol. 1, p.35Mahan Vol. 1, p.101
Jervis was also recognised by both political and military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer.Mahan Vol. 1, p.173 As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy that made him a controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard.

The entrance is on Back George Street, between Princess Street and Dickinson Street in Manchester City Centre Guardian Exchange was an underground telephone exchange built in Manchester in 1954. It was built together with the Anchor Exchange in Birmingham and the Kingsway exchange in London - all believed to provide hardened communications in the event of nuclear war. Today the underground site is used for telephone cabling. Constructed at a depth of 35 metres (115 ft), the tunnels are about 2 metres (80 in) in diameter. The exchange cost around £4 million, part of which was funded by the United Kingdom's NATO partners.

[[Breaststroke]]

CATEGORIES: Breaststroke

Breaststroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer is on his or her chest and the torso does not rotate. It is the most popular recreational style due to the swimmer's head being out of the water a large portion of the time, and that it can be swam comfortably at slow speeds.  In most swimming classes, beginners learn either the breaststroke or the front crawl first.  However, at competition level, swimming breaststroke at speed requires comparable endurance and strength to other strokes. Some people refer to breaststroke as the "frog" stroke, as the arms and legs move somewhat like a frog swimming in the water.  The stroke itself is the slowest of any competitive strokes and thought to be the oldest of all swimming strokes.Maglischo, Ernest W. Swimming fastest p. 219Gifford, Clive Swimming p. 18 Since the breaststroke is swam with the eyes almost always above water, it is important in lifesaving as it allows the rescuer to approach the victim without losing sight of them.

In the related magnetosphere science, the lower frequency electromagnetic oscillations (pulsations occurring below ~3 Hz)  are considered to lie in the ULF range, which is thus also defined differently from the ITU Radio Bands.
ELF radio waves are generated by lightning and natural disturbances in Earth's magnetic field, so they are a subject of research by atmospheric scientists. Because of the difficulty of building antennas that can radiate such long waves, ELF frequencies have been used in only a very few man-made communication systems. ELF waves can penetrate seawater, which makes them useful in communication with submarines. The US and Russia are the only nations known to have constructed ELF communication facilities, with India being in the process of constructing one. The frequency of alternating current flowing in electric power grids, 50 or 60 Hz, falls within this frequency band, and power grids are an unintentional source of ELF radiation.

[[Brickwork]]
CATEGORIES: Bricks, Construction, Construction terminology

Brickwork is masonry produced by a bricklayer, using bricks and mortar in a variety of patterns with a variety of mortar joints. Typically, rows of bricks – called coursesJoseph Moxon. Mechanick Exercises: Or, The Doctrine of Handy-Works. Applied to the Arts of Smithing, Joinery, Carpentry, Turning, Bricklayery. Printed for Daniel Midwinter and Thomas Leigh. 1603. London. Page 129. “Three or four or five course of Bricks to be laid.”Nicholson: The New Practical Builder, and Workman’s Companion. Thomas Kelly, 19 Paternoster Row, London. 1823. “By a Course, in walling, is meant the bricks contained between two planes parallel to the horizon, and terminated by the faces of the wall. The thickness is that of one brick with mortar. The mass formed by bricks laid in concentric order, for arches or vaults, is also denominated a Course.”  – are laid on top of one another to build up a structure such as a brick wall.
The construction industry frequently makes use of brick as a building medium, and examples of brickwork are found right back through history as far as the Bronze Age. The fired-brick faces of the ziggurat of ancient Dur-Kurigalzu in Iraq date from around 140 BC, and the brick buildings of ancient Mohenjo-daro in Pakistan were built around 260 BC. Much older examples of brickwork made with dried (but not fired) bricks may be found in such ancient locations as Jericho in the West Bank, Çatal Hüyük in Anatolia, and Mehrgarh in Pakistan. These structures have survived from the Stone Age to the present day.
Parts of brickwork include bricks, beds and perpends. The bed is the mortar upon which a brick is laid.Peter Nicholson, Practical Masonry Bricklaying and Plastering. Published by Thomas Kelly, Paternoster Row, London. 1841. Page 166. “BED.—The under-surface of bricks when laid in any kind of work.” A perpend is a vertical joint between any two bricks and is usually — but not always — filled with mortar.Reports of artisans selected by a committee appointed by the council of the Society of Arts to visit the Paris Universal exhibition, 1867. Published for the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. Published by Bell and Daldy, York Street, Covent Garden, London. Printed by W. Trounce, Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, London. 1867. Part 1. Bricklaying by George Howell. Page 194. “The beauty of brickwork will very much depend upon the ‘perpends’ being perfectly kept, that is, the prefect regularity of the perpendicular joints right up the building.” The dimensions of these parts are, in general, co-ordinated so that two bricks laid side by side separated only by the width of a perpend have a total width identical to the length of a single brick laid transversely on top of them.
An example of a co-ordinating metric commonly used for bricks in the UK is as follows:R.W. Brunskill. Brick Building in Britain. Victor Gollancz (Publisher) in association with Peter Crawley. An imprint of the Cassell Group. Wellington House, 125 Strand, London WC2R 0BB. 1997. isbn 0575065354. Page 39. “British Standard 3921 of 1969, gave dimensions of 215 by 102.5 by 65 mm ....”British Standards Institution. Specification for Masonry Units. Part 1: Clay Masonry Units. BSI, London, 2003, BS EN 771.The Compressive Strength of Modern Earth Masonry, Andrew Heath, Mike Lawrence, Peter Walker and Clyde Fourie. BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials, University of Bath and Natural Building Technologies (NBT). Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Non-conventional Materials and Technologies (NOCMAT 2009). 6–9 September 2009, Bath, UK. “All earth masonry units were intended to be ‘standard’ brick size (215x102.5x65mm) if they were fired, but because they did not have additional shrinkage from firing, the average size was 223x106x67mm.”
In this case the co-ordinating metric works because the total width of two bricks (102.5 + 102.5 = 205mm) plus a perpend of mortar (10mm) is equal to the length of a single brick (215mm).
There are many other brick sizes worldwide, and many of them use this same co-ordinating principle.

The word tepui means "house of the gods" in the native tongue of the Pemon, the indigenous people who inhabit the Gran Sabana.
Tepuis tend to be found as isolated entities rather than in connected ranges, which makes them the host of a unique array of endemic plant and animal species. Some of the most outstanding tepuis are Neblina, Autana, Auyantepui and Mount Roraima. They are typically composed of sheer blocks of Precambrian quartz arenite sandstone that rise abruptly from the jungle, giving rise to spectacular natural scenery. Auyantepui is the source of Angel Falls, the world's tallest waterfall.

A town meeting is a form of direct democratic rule, used primarily in portions of the United States – principally in New England – since the 17th century, in which most or all the members of a community come together to legislate policy and budgets for local government.
The term has more recently been expanded to cover public meetings that draw people in a geographic area to discuss issues but not vote on any legislative or administrative action. Notably, the term is commonly used by politicians in the United States to describe forums at which voters can ask questions.

Thomas Hawksley ([tpl]Birth date|1807|7|12|df=y[/tpl] – [tpl]Death date|1893|9|15|df=y[/tpl]) was an English civil engineer of the 19th century, particularly associated with early water supply and coal gas engineering projects. Hawksley was, with John Frederick Bateman, the leading British water engineer of the nineteenth century and was personally responsible for upwards of 150 water-supply schemes, in the British Isles and overseas.Hawksley, Thomas, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography
The son of John Hawksley and Mary Whittle, and born in Arnold, near Nottingham on [tpl]Birth date|1807|7|12|df=y[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|url=http://presidentschoice.imeche.org.uk/thomashaksleyinfo.htm|title=IMechE biography[/tpl] Hawksley was largely self-taught from the age of 15 onwards—despite his education at Nottingham High Schoolhttp://www.nottinghampost.com/best-Old-boys-learnt-ropes-historic-High-School/story-19282550-detail/story.html—having at that point become articled to a local firm of architects under the supervision of Edward Staveley that also undertook a variety of water-related engineering projects.
Locally, he remains particularly associated with schemes in his home county. He was engineer to the Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company and Nottingham Waterworks Company for more than half a century, having, early in his career, completed the Trent Bridge waterworks (1831). This scheme delivered Britain's first high pressure 'constant supply', preventing contamination entering the supply of clean water mains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.papplewickpumpingstation.co.uk/nottswh1.htm|title=Nottingham Water Supply – history[/tpl] 
Hawksley first rose to national prominence at the time of the health of towns inquiry in 1844. His advocacy of a constant supply of water to consumers brought him immediate acclaim.  Edwin Chadwick adopted Hawksley as an ally for a time, but Hawksley adopted a more pragmatic approach and was prepared to act for others' undertakings. This approach led him to be appointed to many major water supply projects across England, including schemes for Liverpool, Sheffield, Leicester, Leeds, Derby, Darlington, Oxford, Cambridge, Sunderland, Wakefield and Northampton. He also undertook drainage projects, including schemes for Birmingham, Worcester and Windsor.
In 1852, Hawksley set up his own engineering practice in Westminster, London. He was the first president of the Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.igem.org.uk/company/history.asp|title=IGEM History[/tpl] (serving for three years from 1863), a Fellow of the Royal Society,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/page.asp?id=1727|title=Royal Society list of fellows[/tpl] and was elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1871 (a post his son Charles later occupied in 1901).
Between 1869 and 1879, Hawksley acted as consultant to the construction of Lindley Wood, Swinsty and Fewston reservoirs for the Leeds Waterworks Company.[tpl]cite book|author=Bowtell, Harold D| title=Lesser Railways of the Yorkshire Dales and the Dam Builders in the Age of Steam| publisher=Plateway Press| year=1991| isbn=1-871980-09-7[/tpl]  At Tunstall Reservoir in 1876, and at Cowm Reservoir in 1877-78, he is credited with the first two uses of pressure grouting to control water leakage under an embankment dam.Robert William Rennison, Civil Engineering Heritage: Northern England, p.81A.

Lydia Maria Francis Child (February 11, 1802[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]October 20, 1880) was an American abolitionist, women's rights activist, opponent of American expansionism, Indian rights activist, novelist, and journalist.
Her journals, fiction and domestic manuals reached wide audiences from the 1820s through the 1850s. She at times shocked her audience, as she tried to take on issues of both male dominance and white supremacy in some of her stories.
Despite these challenges, Child was later most remembered for her poem "Over the River and Through the Wood" about Thanksgiving. Her grandfather's house, restored by Tufts University in 1976, still stands near the Mystic River on South Street in Medford, Massachusetts.

A lecturer is, in the broadest sense, a person who gives lectures or other public speeches. However, this article concerns lecturer as an academic rank.
In the United Kingdom a lecturer is usually the holder of an open-ended position at a university or similar institution, often an academic in an early career stage, who teaches and also leads or oversees research groups.
This contrasts with the practice in North America: the United States, Canada and other countries influenced by their educational systems, where the term is used differently. It generally denotes academic experts without tenure in the university, who teach full- or part-time but who have few or no research responsibilities within the institution where they teach.  In most research universities in the United States, the title of lecturer requires a doctorate or equivalent degree.
In the Church of England, the position of lecturer can also refer to a junior clergyman.

Aline Chrétien (born May 14, 1936) is the wife of Canada's twentieth Prime Minister, Jean Chrétien.
Born Aline Chaîné in Saint-Boniface-de-Shawinigan, Quebec, she married lawyer Jean Chrétien on September 10, 1957. They have two sons, Hubert and Michel Chrétien, and one daughter France Chrétien Desmarais.
Fluent in Italian, Spanish, English, and French, Aline Chrétien has been active in a number of charitable organizations over the years since her husband was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 1963.  In addition to her keen interest in languages, Madame Chrétien took piano courses during her 50s, and has become an advocate for The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto.
On November 5, 1995, an intruder, André Dallaire, broke into the Prime Minister's residence at 24 Sussex Drive, in Ottawa, Ontario. Awake next to her sleeping husband, Aline Chrétien confronted the intruder at their bedroom door. Seeing that he was armed with a large knife, she slammed the door and locked it, then woke her husband.
Her husband sought out her advice often.  Maclean's magazine in 1996 listed her first among his most influential advisors, saying "Never mind calling her the power behind the throne—she shares the seat of power.""The opinions the PM heeds," Maclean's, October 14, 1996, vol. 109, issue 42, p. 18-19.  In 2000, Allan Fotheringham in the same magazine described Jean and Aline Chrétien as the two "most powerful" politicians in Canada, above Eddie Goldenberg and Jean Pelletier.Allan Fotheringham, "Aline, the power player," Maclean's, December 11, 2000, vol. 113, issue 50, p. 68.
Jean Chrétien has publicly stated that she is his key advisor.  He once joked that Canada is run exclusively by women:  the monarch, the Governor General and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court were all women, and Madame Chrétien was pulling the strings of the Prime Minister. He made similar jokes often, once telling a reporter that he did not know when the next election would be because he had not yet asked Aline. 
In her role as the prime minister's spouse, she went to the memorial of the victim of the W. R. Myers High School shooting in 1999, along with Alberta Premier Ralph Klein, Opposition Leader Preston Manning, and the Attorney General of Canada Anne McLellan.CBC.ca, "Canada grieves along with Taber," May 4, 1999, URL accessed December 19, 2006.  
On September 22, 2010, she was named as first-ever chancellor of Laurentian University, a bilingual educational institution in Sudbury, Ontario."Aline Chrétien named first chancellor of Laurentian University". Toronto Star, September 22, 2010.

[[Walter Trohan]]

CATEGORIES: 1903 births, 2003 deaths, American centenarians

Walter J. Trohan (July 4, 1903 – October 30, 2003) was a former Chicago Tribune reporter and bureau chief in Washington, D.C., and was regarded as the last of the  metropolitan newspaper Washington bureau chiefs whose bylines made them famous.
Trohan began his career as a reporter in 1929 at Chicago's City News Bureau.  As a young reporter he was first on the scene of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre when Al Capone's gang gunned down several members of the rival Bugs Moran gang. 
He began covering Washington in the second year of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency (1934). He retired on December 31,1968.  In spite of the Tribune's hostility to Roosevelt's policies, Trohan and the president got along well. 
Trohan was known for ferreting out the fact that President Truman planned to fire General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of UN forces in Korea. When Truman found out that Trohan knew about his plan, he publicly announced his decision and robbed Trohan of the scoop.
In 1975 Trohan wrote his memoirs and titled the book Political Animals. In the book, he recalled how when he arrived in Washington in 1934 as an assistant correspondent in the Tribune's Washington Bureau. He could remember freely wandering Roosevelt's White House and interviewing cabinet members and other staff. Due to tightened security measures, this freedom no longer exists.
Trohan is the source for much unique information about Franklin Roosevelt's health that turned up in various publications and FBI documents. He was the source for much of a controversial article published by Dr. Karl C. Wold in Look Magazine in 1947. He also collaborated with James A. Farley in ghost writing his memoirs. Trohan's papers are housed at the Herbert Hoover Library, near Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
Trohan was president of the White House Correspondents' Association in 1937-1938[http://www.whca.net/officers.htm| White House Correspondents Association|accessdate=2 August 2010 and the Gridiron Club in 1967. He died in late 2003 at the age of 100.

Gray's beaked whale (Mesoplodon grayi), sometimes known as Haast's beaked whale, the Scamperdown whale, or the southern beaked whale, is one of the better-known members of the genus Mesoplodon. The scientific name refers to John Edward Gray, a zoologist at the British Museum. This species is fairly gregarious and strands relatively frequently for a beaked whale. It is notable for being the only beaked whale, other than Shepherd's beaked whale (not a Mesoplodon), that has numerous teeth.

[[Hector's beaked whale]]

CATEGORIES: Mesoplodont whales, Cetaceans of Australia, Animals described in 1871

Hector's beaked whale (Mesoplodon hectori), is a small mesoplodont living in the Southern Hemisphere. This whale is named after Sir James Hector, a founder of the colonial museum in Wellington, New Zealand. Some specimens washed up and been sighted in California and once thought to belong to this species have subsequently been shown through analysis of mtDNA and detailed morhological examination to be a new species, Perrin's beaked whale (Dalebout et al. 2002). The species has rarely been seen in the wild.
Some data supposedly referring to this species, especially juveniles and males, turned out to be based on the misidentified specimens of Perrin's beaked whale - especially since the adult male of Hector's beaked whale was only more recently described. Dalebout et al. (2002) specifically list Mead (1981), Mead (1984), Mead & Baker (1987), Mead (1989), Baker (1990), Jefferson et al. (1993), Mead (1993), Carwardine (1995), Reeves and Leatherwood (1994), Henshaw et al.

The pygmy beaked whale (Mesoplodon peruvianus), also known as the bandolero beaked whale, Peruvian beaked whale and lesser beaked whale, is the smallest of the mesoplodonts and one of the newest discoveries. There were at least two dozen sightings of an unknown beaked whale named Mesoplodon sp. A before the initial classification, and those are now believed to be synonymous with the species. The species was formally described in 1991, based on ten specimens obtained from Peru between 1976 and 1989, including a 3.72 m (12.2 ft) adult male as the type specimen. A specimen that stranded at Paracas, Peru in 1955 (first tentatively identified as Andrews' beaked whale) has since been identified as a pygmy beaked whale. Since 1987, there have been an additional 40 sightings of the species, for a total of 65 (as of 2001).Pitman RL, Lynn MS (2001).

Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), sometimes known as the Bering Sea beaked whale or the Saber-toothed whale, is a poorly known member of the genus Mesoplodon inhabiting the northern North Pacific Ocean. Leonhard Hess Stejneger collected the type specimen (a beach-worn skull) on Bering Island in 1883, which provided the description by Frederick W. True in 1885. In 1904, the first complete skull (from an adult male that had stranded near Newport, Oregon) was collected, which confirmed the species' validity.True, F.W. 1910.

[[Iris recognition]]

CATEGORIES: Applications of computer vision, Biometrics, English inventions, University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory

Iris recognition is an automated method of biometric identification that uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques on video images of the irides of an individual's eyes, whose complex random patterns are unique and can be seen from some distance.
Not to be confused with other, less prevalent, ocular-based technologies, retina scanning and eye printing, iris recognition uses camera technology with subtle infrared illumination to acquire images of the detail-rich, intricate structures of the iris externally visible at the front of the eye. Digital templates encoded from these patterns by mathematical and statistical algorithms allow the identification of an individual or someone pretending to be that individual.[tpl]cite news|last=Zetter|first=Kim|title=Reverse-Engineered Irises Look So Real, They Fool Eye-Scanners|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/reverse-engineering-iris-scans/all/|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=2012-07-25[/tpl] Databases of enrolled templates are searched by matcher engines at speeds measured in the millions of templates per second per (single-core) CPU, and with remarkably low false match rates.
Many millions of persons in several countries around the world have been enrolled in iris recognition systems, for convenience purposes such as passport-free automated border-crossings, and some national ID systems based on this technology are being deployed. A key advantage of iris recognition, besides its speed of matching and its extreme resistance to false matches, is the stability of the iris as an internal, protected, yet externally visible organ of the eye.

[[Active and passive transformation]]
CATEGORIES: Systems theory, Mathematical terminology, Concepts in physics

In physics and engineering, an active transformation, or alibi transformation, is a transformation which actually changes the physical position of a point, or rigid body, and makes sense even in the absence of a coordinate system whereas a passive transformation, or alias transformation, is a change in the position of the coordinate system from which the object is observed (change of basis). By default, by transformation, mathematicians usually mean active transformations, while physicists and engineers could mean either.
Put differently, a passive transformation refers to observation of the same event from two different coordinate systems.
On the other hand, the active transformation is a new position of all points, relative to the same coordinate system. For instance, the active transformation is useful to describe successive positions of a rigid body. On the other hand, the passive transformation may be useful in human motion analysis to observe the motion of the tibia relative to the femur, i.e. its motion relative to a (local) coordinate system which moves together with the femur, rather than a (global) coordinate system which is fixed to the floor.

[[Mathematical puzzle]]

CATEGORIES: Recreational mathematics, Puzzles

Mathematical puzzles make up an integral part of recreational mathematics. They have specific rules as do multiplayer games, but they do not usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, to solve such a puzzle, the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions. Mathematical puzzles require mathematics to solve them. Logic puzzles are a common type of mathematical puzzle.
Conway's Game of Life and fractals, as two examples, may also be considered mathematical puzzles even though the solver interacts with them only at the beginning by providing a set of initial conditions. After these conditions are set, the rules of the puzzle determine all subsequent changes and moves. Many of the puzzles are well known because they were discussed by Martin Gardner in his "Mathematical Games" column in Scientific American. Mathematical puzzles are sometimes used to motivate students in teaching elementary school math problem solving techniques.Kulkarni, D.

Christopher Gilbert "Chris" Pérez (born August 14, 1969) is an American guitarist, songwriter and author best known as lead guitarist for the Tejano band Selena y Los Dinos. He married the frontwoman of the group, Selena, on April 2, 1992. Pérez grew up in San Antonio, Texas as one of two children of Gilbert Pérez and Carmen Medina. In 1986, he joined Shelly Lares' band. By the late 1980s, Pérez was reputed among Tejano musicians for his guitar skills. This caught A.B. Quintanilla III's attention; at the time, Quintanilla was seeking another guitarist for the band he produced, Selena y Los Dinos. Shortly after Pérez joined the band, he and Selena began a personal relationship.
Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., forced them to end their relationship because he felt Pérez' image might damage Selena's career. They ignored his threats to disband the group, and continued their relationship. Quintanilla Jr. fired Pérez from the band, forbidding Selena to go with him. They later eloped, and Selena's father accepted the relationship. Pérez was asked to collaborate on several of Selena's songs with A.B. and other members of the band, using his guitar to piece out melodies and incorporating a number of musical genres into their songs.
During the early 1990s Pérez was arrested for driving under the influence in San Antonio, but was released without charge. Within months of his first arrest, Pérez was involved in a trashed-hotel-room incident; he and two members of Selena y Los Dinos were intoxicated and began wrestling in a room, breaking the door and punching holes in the walls. On March 31, 1995 Selena was killed by her friend and former manager of her boutiques, Yolanda Saldivar. Her death devastated Pérez, who began abusing drugs and alcohol.
In 1998 he met Venessa Villanueva through his friend John Garza, and began dating her. That year, Pérez formed the Chris Pérez Band and began writing songs for their debut album. They signed with Hollywood Records and released their first album, Resurrection, which won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album. The band disbanded after their second album, Una Noche Mas (2002), was released. Pérez and Villanueva had two children, Cassie and Noah, before divorcing in 2008. Pérez continued in the music business and often played with A.B.'s groups, the Kumbia Kings and the Kumbia All-Starz. He left both groups and formed another band (the Chris Pérez Project, which included Puerto Rican singer Angel Ferrer) in 2010. In 2012 Pérez wrote a book about his and Selena's relationship entitled To Selena, With Love, which received a positive reception from critics and fans.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, the grandson of Canadian financier Sir John Aird, John Black Aird was educated at Upper Canada College, Trinity College and Osgoode Hall Law School. He was a Brother at the Toronto Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi. He practised law in Toronto and headed his own firm, Aird & Berlis LLP in 1974.
Aird served as a director of several corporations.
In 1958 Aird was appointed to the board of directors of Callaghan Mining.
Aird later served as chairman of the board of Algoma Central Railway.
During World War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve. In 1944, he married Lucille Housser. From 1964 to 1974, he served as a Liberal Senator. In 1971, he was Chairman of the Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defence. From 1977 to 1985, he was Chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo.
Aird was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada, and served as Lieutenant-Governor from 1980 to 1985. The main focus of his mandate was Ontarians with disabilities. He wrote a book, Loyalty in a Changing World, about the contemporary function of the Lieutenant Governor.
He was lieutenant-governor when, shortly following the 1985 Ontario election, the Progressive Conservative minority government of Frank Miller was defeated by a motion of no confidence. The defeat occurred after an accord was reached between the David Peterson Liberals and Bob Rae's New Democratic Party to allow the Liberals to form a minority government for two years with NDP support despite the fact that the Liberals had slightly fewer seats than the Tories. Some media outlets, such as the conservative Toronto Sun, compared the matter to the King-Byng Affair and accused Aird of partisanship for asking Peterson to form a government rather than dissolving the legislature and calling a new election. The consensus among constitutional experts, however, is that Aird acted correctly as there had been an election only weeks before the government's defeat in the House, and as it was clear that Peterson had the support in the House to form a government.

The day's name originated in Philadelphia, where it originally was used to describe the heavy and disruptive pedestrian and vehicle traffic which would occur on the day after Thanksgiving.Ben Zimmer, The Origins of "Black Friday," Word Routes (November 25, 2011).Martin L. Apfelbaum, Philadelphia's "Black Friday," American Philatelist, vol. 69, no. 4, p. 239 (Jan. 1966). Use of the term started before 1961 and began to see broader use outside Philadelphia around 1975. Later an alternative explanation was made: that retailers traditionally operated at a financial loss ("in the red") from January through November, and "Black Friday" indicates the point at which retailers begin to turn a profit, or "in the black".[tpl]cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/11/black-friday|title=Black Friday|author=Kevin Drum|date=November 26, 2010[/tpl] For large retail chains like Walmart, their net income is positive starting from January 1, and Black Friday can boost their year to date net profit from $14 billion to $19 billion.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

William Earl Rowe, PC (May 13, 1894 – February 9, 1984), was a politician in Ontario, Canada.  He served as the 20th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1963 to 1968. He also had four children, one of which died during labour.
Rowe was born in Hull, Iowa of Canadian parents in 1894. He moved to Ontario with his family at the age of two and grew up to become a farmer and cattle breeder. He was reeve of the township of West Gwillimbury from 1919 to 1923. Rowe served as a Member of Provincial Parliament from 1923 to 1925, and was then elected to the House of Commons, where he served until 1935.
From 1936 to 1938, he was leader of Conservative Party of Ontario though, as he did not have a seat in the legislature George S. Henry remained Leader of the Opposition.
In the public mind, the cause of labour was identified with the American Congress of Industrial Organizations and communism. During the 1937 provincial election when Liberal premier Mitchell Hepburn was railing against the C.I.O's attempt to unionize General Motors and the supposed threat posed by organized labour, Rowe refused to take a stand against the C.I.O. and repeatedly asserted that: "the issue was not law and order but the right of free association."  At the time the Conservatives were strongly associated with the Orange Order which had long held a pro-labour position. Rowe's stance resulted in George A. Drew breaking with the party in order to run as an "Independent Conservative" in the 1937 election in opposition to Rowe's position.
Rowe failed to win his seat in the 1937 provincial election and successfully ran in a by-election held in November 1937 to regain the seat in the federal House of Commons he had resigned from two months earlier to run in the provincial election. He was succeeded as leader by former rival Drew.  Drew went on to serve as Premier of Ontario in the 1940s before moving to federal politics.
Rowe served in the House of Commons until 1962. On two occasions (1954–1955 and 1956) when George Drew, who had by this point become federal PC leader, was unable to perform his duties due to ill health, Rowe served as acting leader of the official opposition.
From 1958 to 1962, he and his daughter, Jean Casselman Wadds, were the only father and daughter to ever sit together in Parliament.
Rowe was lieutenant governor of Ontario from 1963 to 1968. A champion and supporter of agriculture and rural affairs, particularly harness horse racing,http://www.ourstoriesinnisfil.ca/fedora/repository/ourstories%3A10763|Bradford Witness he died in 1984 at Newton Robinson, Ontario.
The Honourable Earl Rowe Public School in Bradford, Ontario, and Earl Rowe Provincial Park, near Alliston are named in his honour.

Sheffield City Hall is a Grade II* listed building[tpl]IoE|455364|City Hall|accessdate=20 February 2006[/tpl] in Sheffield, England, containing several venues, ranging from the Oval Concert Hall which seats over 2,000 people to a ballroom featuring a sprung dance floor.  It is currently operated by Sheffield International Venues.
The large hall dominates Barker's Pool, one of Sheffield's central squares, which also contains the city's War Memorial.
The building was designed in 1920 by E. Vincent Harris but construction was delayed 8 years because of the economic climate in the early 1920s. Eventually construction started with the laying of the foundation stone in 1929 and the City Hall was officially opened on 22 September 1932. During the Second World War a bomb exploded in Barkers Pool, damaging the pillars of the building. The scars of the explosion can still be seen to this day.Sheffield City Hall website It is a neo-classical building with a giant portico. The Oval Hall is the largest hall in the building, seating 2,271 people and is commanded by an angel's chorus. This provides both natural light to the main hall and can also be used by a hidden choir whose voices are carried through the building and down onto the audience.  The Grand Willis III Organ is the largest in Sheffield with over 4000 pipes and four manuals.  The organ sits in a chamber situated behind the large decorative grilles facing the audience.
The Oval Hall is complemented by the more intimate 500-seater Memorial Hall and the Ballroom which can host anything from after show parties to club nights and afternoon tea-dances.
In 2005, the City Hall and its surroundings were refurbished and re-developed at a cost of £12.5 million.
The hall is managed by the Sheffield City Trust, under a 99 year lease.

Attercliffe Chapel, also known as the Hill Top Chapel, is a Gothic chapel in Attercliffe, now a suburb of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.  The chapel was constructed in 1629, when Attercliffe was a township separate from Sheffield, although in the same parish.
By the 1840s, the chapel was used only for funeral services.George Calvert Holland, The Vital Statistics of Sheffield, p. 225.
The chapel, surrounded by its cemetery, and lying on the south bank of the River Don, was largely rebuilt in 1909, but retains its period atmosphere. It is Grade II listed.

The Luo (also spelled Lwo) are several ethnically and linguistically related Nilotic ethnic groups in Africa that inhabit an area ranging from South Sudan and Ethiopia, through northern Uganda and eastern Congo (DRC), into western Kenya, and the Mara Region of Tanzania. 
Their Luo languages belong to the Nilotic group and as such form part of the larger Eastern Sudanic family.
Within the Nilotic languages, the Luo together with the Dinka–Nuer form the Western Nilotic branch.
Groups within the Luo nation include the Shilluk, Anuak, Acholi, Alur, Padhola, Joluo (Kenyan and Tanzanian Luo), Bor, Luwo
The Joluo and their language Dholuo are also known as the "Luo proper", being eponymous of the larger group.
The level of historical separation between these groups is estimated at about eight centuries. Dispersion from the Nilotic homeland in South Sudan was presumably triggered by the turmoils of the Muslim conquest of Sudan, and the migration of the individual groups over the last few centuries can to some extent be traced in the respective group's oral history.

[[Labor Right]]

CATEGORIES: Political party factions in Australia, Australian Labor Party

The Labor Right, or Labor Unity in some State branches, or Centre Unity in NSW, is the organised faction of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) that tends to be more economically liberal and socially conservative than Labor Left.
Nationally, the Right is a broad alliance of the various Right state groupings. Each state may have one or two different sub-factions, generally the right and centre leaning factions of each state branch. State-based factions (national sub-factions) which make up the National Right include:
New South Wales
Queensland
Australian Capital Territory
Victoria
Western Australia
Northern Territory
South Australia
Factional power usually finds expression in the percentage vote of aligned delegates at party conferences. The power of the Labor Right varies from state to state, but it usually relies on certain trade unions, such as the Australian Workers' Union, National Union of Workers and the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association which send factionally aligned delegates to conference and also from ordinary party members with right wing alliance.
The Right is currently the dominant faction in the Labor party. The Labor Right faction also holds a majority on the party's National Executive. The usual arrangement is that the federal leader of the party is from the Right, while the deputy leader is from the Left, although former federal Labor leader and Prime Minister Julia Gillard was from the Left with support of the Right. Most of the Labor state Premiers are associated with the Right; there are some exceptions, such as former Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, former Tasmanian Premier Lara Giddings and South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill.

The Socialist Left also known as Labor left is a faction of the Australian Labor Party. The Left is an organised political faction that advocates within the party for traditionally Labor interventionist and socialist economic policies. However, since the party reforms by Gough Whitlam in the 1970s, the Left has also been the principal champion in the party of socially liberal values, such as women's rights, gay rights, reconciliation with Aboriginal Australians and land rights. It advocates an independent foreign policy which benefits Australia and its citizens rather than its foreign allies as many members of the faction are unenthusiastic about the Australia–US Alliance.

[[Frame bundle]]
CATEGORIES: Fiber bundles, Vector bundles

In mathematics, a frame bundle is a principal fiber bundle F(E) associated to any vector bundle E. The fiber of F(E) over a point x is the set of all ordered bases, or frames, for Ex. The general linear group acts naturally on F(E) via a change of basis, giving the frame bundle the structure of a principal GL(k, R)-bundle (where k is the rank of E).
The frame bundle of a smooth manifold is the one associated to its tangent bundle. For this reason it is sometimes called the tangent frame bundle.

[[Water dropwort]]

CATEGORIES: Apiaceae, Poisonous plants

The water dropworts, Oenanthe [tpl]IPAc-en|ɔɪ|ˈ|n|æ|n|θ|i:[/tpl], are a genus of plants in the family Apiaceae.  Most of the species grow in damp ground, in marshes or in water.
Several of the species are extremely poisonous, the active poison being oenanthotoxin. The most notable of these is O. crocata, which lives in damp, marshy ground, and resembles celery with roots like a bunch of large white carrots. The leaves may be eaten safely by livestock, but the stems, and especially the carbohydrate-rich roots are much more poisonous.  Animals familiar with eating the leaves may eat the roots when these are exposed during ditch clearance – one root is sufficient to kill a cow, and human fatalities are also known. It has been referred to as the most poisonous of all British plants,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sci_programmes/documents/31Oenanthecrocata.pdf | title=Information Sheet: 31 Hemlock Water Dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) | publisher=Centre for Ecology and Hydrology | year=2005 | accessdate=September 28, 2011 | format=pdf | quote=Oenanthe crocata ... is the most toxic plant in Britain to both humans and animals.[/tpl] and is considered particularly dangerous because of its similarity to several edible plants.[tpl]Citation|title=Hedgerow|last=Wright|first=John|isbn=978-1-4088-0185-7|year=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury|page=171[/tpl]
The species O. javanica, commonly known as Chinese celery or Japanese parsley (seri; not to be confused with mitsuba or Japanese wild celery, a plant from a different genus) is edible and grown in several countries of eastern Asia, as well as in Italy and India, where the spring growth is relished as a vegetable.

Hearst Castle is a National and California Historical Landmark mansion located on the Central Coast of California, United States.  It was designed by architect Julia Morgan between 1919 and 1947 for newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, who died in 1951. The Hearst Corporation donated the property to the state of California in 1957.  Since that time it has been maintained as a state historic park where the estate, and its considerable collection of art and antiques, is open for public tours. Despite its location far from any urban center, the site attracts about one million visitors per year.
Hearst formally named the estate "La Cuesta Encantada" ("The Enchanted Hill"), but usually called it "the ranch".  Hearst Castle and grounds are also sometimes referred to as "San Simeon" without distinguishing between the Hearst property and the adjacent unincorporated area of the same name.

[[Lithotomy position]]

CATEGORIES: Human positions, Childbirth

The lithotomy position is a medical term referring to a common position for surgical procedures and medical examinations involving the pelvis and lower abdomen, as well as a common position for childbirth in Western nations. The lithotomy position involves the positioning of an individual's feet above or at the same level as the hips (often in stirrups), with the perineum positioned at the edge of an examination table. References to the position have been found in some of the oldest known medical documents including versions of the Hippocratic oath (see lithotomy); the position is named after the ancient surgical procedure for removing kidney stones, gall stones and bladder stones via the perineum. The position is perhaps most recognizable as the 'often used' position for childbirth: the patient is laid on the back with knees bent, positioned above the hips, and spread apart through the use of stirrups.
The position is frequently used and has many obvious benefits from the doctor's perspective. Most notably the position provides good visual and physical access to the perineal region. The position is used for procedures ranging from simple pelvic exams to surgeries and procedures involving, but not limited to reproductive organs, urology, and gastrointestinal systems. New observations and scientific findings, combined with a greater sensitivity to patient needs have raised awareness of the physical and psychological risks the position may pose for prolonged surgical procedures, pelvic examinations, and, most notably, childbirth.

Frank Ray Lawson, OBE (August 30, 1886 – April 4, 1980), was the 17th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1946 to 1952.
Born in London, Ontario, he was the son of Francis Edgar ("Frank") Lawson, a former newspaper reporter, and Lorena Hodgins, a former teacher. He studied at London Collegiate and attended Woodstock College in 1902, but left after less than a year, eager to begin a business career.  At age 17, he began working as a clerk in a London dry goods business, and later worked as a traveling salesman for a wholesale jeweler, before becoming a traveling salesman for Lawson & Jones Limited, the printing firm co-founded by his father. In 1909 he married Helen Newton and they later had five children.
In 1911, following the sudden death of his father, Lawson returned to London and assumed his father's position with Lawson & Jones. In 1913, he borrowed heavily to purchase the shares held by the Jones family and, at the age of 26, became the company's president, director and major shareholder.  In addition to printing druggists' labels and calendars, in 1916 Lawson & Jones entered into a profitable arrangement to manufacture cigarette packaging for Imperial Tobacco.  By 1920, Lawson had retired the debt he incurred and throughout the depression the company grew by acquiring and consolidating other printing concerns.
When war broke out in 1939, Lawson went to work for C.D. Howe, Canadian Federal Minister of Munitions and Supply, as a "dollar-a-year-man", and was appointed president of Federal Aircraft Limited, a crown corporation established in Montreal to manufacture the Avro Anson trainer for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. He was named an Officer of the Order of the British empire in 1942.
During his career, Lawson was a senior executive or director of 20 Canadian companies, including: president, Lawson & Jones Ltd., president, Canadian Containers; president, Midland Securities, Ltd.; vice-president and director, The Royal Bank of Canada; director, Traders Finance Corporation Limited; director, London & Western Trust Co. Ltd.; vice-president and director, Canada Trust Company Ltd.; director, Huron & Erie Loan and Savings Company; director, Northern Life Assurance Co. of Canada; director, Toronto General Insurance; director, Great Lakes Paper.  Eight universities conferred honorary degrees on him.
Ray Lawson was Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1946 to 1952. He was later Canadian Consul-General in New York from 1953 to 1955. From 1948 to 1956, he was the Chancellor of University of King's College, Halifax, Nova Scotia.
In 1947, Lawson purchased the Oakville lakeshore estate, “Ballymena” that was previously owned by William Fletcher Eaton, to have a suitable residence close to Toronto and for use in his capacity as Lieutenant Governor. It became his permanent home.
Lawson was an active philanthropist most of his life, having sponsored the building of a library at the University of Western Ontario as early as 1933, and over the years creating various scholarships, trusts and contributing to charitable societies. In 1956, he established the Lawson Foundation, with assets of $2,000,000. The Foundation has since donated over $50 million to charities across Canada and in 2005 had an endowment of over $90 million.
Ray Lawson died in 1980 and was buried at Woodland Cemetery, London, Ontario.
His descendants currently reside all over the world, including Australia, Japan and South Africa. They continue to participate in and volunteer with the Lawson Foundation.
Has a street named after him in Brampton, ON and in Montreal, QC (Anjou borough).

CATEGORIES: Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, American magazines, Journalism reviews, Publications established in 1961

The Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) is an American magazine for professional journalists published bimonthly by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism since 1961.
Its contents include news and media industry trends, analysis, professional ethics and stories behind news.  
The chairman of the magazine is Victor Navasky, a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and former editor and publisher of the politically progressive The Nation. According to Executive Editor Michael Hoyt, Navasky's role is "99% financial" and "he doesn't push anything editorially," adding that Navasky has "learned how to get a small magazine of ideas into the black, and he's trying to come up with some strategies for us."Graham Webster, "Victor Navasky Now Playing Key Role at 'CJR'", Editor & Publisher, July 15, 2005
In August 2007, Mike Hoyt, the CJR's executive editor since 2003, said the CJR's income in 2007 would exceed expenses by about $50,000, with estimates of a $40,000 surplus in 2008. Hoyt attributed the surpluses to a mix of some staff cuts, such as not replacing three editors who left, and fundraising increases.  Donations to the CJR in the past three years have included about $1.25 million from a group of news veterans headed by former Philadelphia Inquirer executive editor Eugene Roberts.Joe Strupp, "AJR Facing Major Debt -- But CJR Says It's In The Black", Editor & Publisher, August 22, 2007
As of mid-2007, the CJR had an eight-person staff, an annual budget of $2.3 million, and circulation of about 19,000, including 6,000 student subscriptions.

"One big reason" for almost 75% increase in the population of Hamilton between 1901 and 1912, boasted Sir John Morison Gibson of Dominion Power and Transmission Company, was "Cheap Electric Power Furnished By Us." This simplistic explanation for the development of Hamilton in the early twentieth century leaves much unexamined, but one conclusion cannot be disputed. In the perception of the Hamilton public, a view certainly fostered by Gibson and his fellow hydroelectric promoters, Hamilton was no longer regarded the Birmingham or the Pittsburgh of Canada Hamilton was now, as the title of a 1906 promotional booklet on the city proudly proclaimed, "The Electric City."

Emi Koussi is a high pyroclastic shield volcano that lies at the south end of the Tibesti Mountains in the central Sahara of northern Chad. It is the highest mountain in Chad, and the highest in the Sahara. The volcano is one of several in the Tibesti massif, and reaches [tpl]convert|3445|m|ft|0[/tpl] in altitude, rising [tpl]convert|2.3|km|mi|1|abbr=on[/tpl] above the surrounding sandstone plains. The volcano is 60 by 80 km wide.
Two nested calderas cap the volcano, the outer one being about 12 by 15 km in size.  Within it on the southeast side is a smaller caldera, about 2–3 km wide and 350 m deep.  Numerous lava domes, cinder cones, maars, and lava flows are found both within the calderas and along the outer flanks of the shield. The inner caldera contains large natron deposits which see some harvesting for domestic animal salt lick use by the local people.
Emi Koussi has been studied as an analog of the Martian volcano Elysium Mons.  One of the most important morphological differences between volcanoes on Mars and Earth is the widespread furrowing of the surface due to flowing water on terrestrial volcanoes. The furrows are shallow valleys. Larger channels have a different origin. Major channels can be seen on volcanoes on both planets and indicate low points in caldera rims where lava spilled out of pre-collapse craters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=3023|title=Emi Koussi Volcano, Chad, North Africa|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|date=December 8, 2002|accessdate=3 November 2013[/tpl]

[tpl]More footnotes|article|date=March 2009[/tpl][tpl]Schwarzenau Brethren[/tpl]
The Schwarzenau Brethren, or German Baptist Brethren as it is known in America, originated in Germany, the outcome of the Radical Pietist ferment of the late 17th and early 18th century. Hopeful of the imminent return of Christ, the founding Brethren abandoned the established Reformed and Lutheran churches, forming a new church in 1708 when their apocalyptic hopes were still unfulfilled. They thereby attempted to translate "the Philadelphian idea of love into concrete congregational ordinances obligatory for all the members."Meier, Marcus (2008). The Origin of the Schwarzenau Brethren. Philadelphia: Brethren Encyclopedia, Inc. p. 144. Unlike the Philadelphians, Brethren rejected Leade's embrace of direct revelation and emphasized early ("Apostolic" or "primitive") Christianity as the binding standard for congregational practices. The founding Brethren were also in conversation with Mennonites and influenced by Anabaptist writings.
In Germany the Brethren became known as [tpl]lang|de|Neue Täufer[/tpl] (New Baptists), in distinction from the older Anabaptist groups. In the United States they became popularly known as Dunkers, Dunkards or Tunkers, corruptions of the German verb tunken, to dip. Another religious group related historically to the same Radical Pietist ferment as the Brethren is the Community of True Inspiration.

[[Body language]]

CATEGORIES: Human positions, Nonverbal communication, Social philosophy, Social psychology

Body language refers to various forms of nonverbal communication, wherein a person may reveal clues as to some unspoken intention or feeling through their physical behaviour. These behaviours can include body posture, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movements.  Body language also varies depending on the culture and most behaviors are not universally accepted. Although this article focuses on interpretations of human body language, also animals use body language as a communication mechanism. Body language is typically subconscious behaviour, and is therefore considered distinct from sign language, which is a fully conscious and intentional act of communication.
Body language may provide clues as to the attitude or state of mind of a person. For example, it may indicate aggression, attentiveness, boredom, a relaxed state, pleasure, amusement, and intoxication.
Body language is significant to communication and relationships. It is relevant to management and leadership in business and also in places where it can be observed by many people. It can also be relevant to some outside of the workplace. It is commonly helpful in dating, mating, in family settings, and parenting. Although body language is non-verbal or non-spoken, it can reveal much about your feelings and meaning to others and how others reveal their feelings toward you. Body language signals happen on both a conscious and unconscious level.[tpl]cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Sandra|title=Body Language|url=http://www.businessballs.com/body-language.htm|accessdate=10 April 2013[/tpl]

From the late 1870s to the 1920s, the Vanderbilt family employed some of the country's best Beaux-Arts architects and decorators to build an unequalled string of New York townhouses and East Coast palaces in the United States. Many of the Vanderbilt houses are now National Historic Landmarks. Some photographs of Vanderbilt's residences in New York are included in the Photographic series of American Architecture by Albert Levy (1870s).
The list of architects employed by the Vanderbilts is a "who's who" of the New York-based firms that embodied the syncretic (often dismissed as "eclectic") styles of the American Renaissance: Richard Morris Hunt, George B. Post, McKim, Mead, and White, Charles B. Atwood, Carrère and Hastings, Warren and Wetmore, Horace Trumbauer, John Russell Pope and Addison Mizner were all employed by the descendants of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who built only very modestly himself.

The Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award honors excellence in broadcast and digital journalism in the public service. The awards, established in 1942 and administered since 1968 by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, are considered a broadcast equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize, another program administered by Columbia University.
Dedicated to upholding the highest journalism standards, the duPont awards inform the public about the contributions news organizations and journalists make to their communities, support journalism education and innovation, and cultivate a collective spirit for the profession.
The duPont-Columbia Awards were established by Jessie Ball duPont in memory of her husband Alfred I. du Pont. It is the most well-respected journalism-only award for broadcast journalism, and starting in 2009, under new director Abi Wright, began accepting digital submissions. The duPont, along with the George Foster Peabody Awards, rank among the most prestigious awards programs in all electronic media.
The duPont-Columbia jury select the winners from programs that air in the United States between July 1 and June 30 of each year. Award winners receive batons in gold and silver designed by the American architect Louis I. Kahn.  The gold baton, when awarded, is given exclusively in honor of truly outstanding broadcast journalism.
In 2012, the first-ever theatrically released documentary film was honored by the duPont Jury: "Hell and Back Again" about the war in Afghanistan and the struggles facing veterans when they return home.
In 2010, the first award for digital reporting was given to MediaStorm and photographer Jonathan Torgovnik for "Intended Consequences" about children born of rape in Rwanda.
In 2003, the first-ever foreign-language program was awarded a duPont-Columbia Award. CNN en Español and reporter Jorge Gestoso won a Silver Baton for investigative reporting on Argentina's desaparecidos.

The Sukhoi Su-25 (NATO reporting name: "Frogfoot") is a single-seat, twin-engine jet aircraft developed in the Soviet Union by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. It was designed to provide close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 22 February 1975. After testing, the aircraft went into series production in 1978 at Tbilisi in the Soviet Republic of Georgia. Russian air and ground forces nicknamed it "Grach" ("Rook").
Early variants included the Su-25UB two-seat trainer, the Su-25BM for target-towing, and the Su-25K for export customers. Some aircraft are being upgraded to version Su-25SM as of 2012. The Su-25T and the Su-25TM (also known as Su-39) were further developments, not produced in numbers. The Su-25, along with the Su-34, were the only armoured fixed-wing aircraft in production in 2007.Gordon and Dawes 2004. Su-25 is in service with Russia, other CIS states, and export customers.
The Su-25 has seen combat in several conflicts during its more than 25 years in service. It was heavily involved in the Soviet war in Afghanistan, flying counter-insurgency missions against the Mujahideen. The Iraqi Air Force employed Su-25s against Iran during the 1980–89 Iran–Iraq War. Most were later destroyed or fled to Iran in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Abkhazian separatists used Su-25s during the Abkhazian War. The Macedonian Air Force used Su-25s against Albanian insurgents in the 2001 Macedonia conflict and, in 2008, Georgia and Russia both used Su-25s in the Russo-Georgian War.  African states, including the Ivory Coast, Chad, and Sudan have used the Su-25 in local insurgencies and civil wars.

[[Extended Vector Animation]]

CATEGORIES: Animation software, Graphics file formats

Extended Vector Animation (EVA) is a web-based vector graphic file format developed by Sharp Corporation in 1996. The EVA format differs from other vector formats because only the changes in vectors over time is recorded instead of information per frame. The format is popular in Japan and several versions of EVA Animator software have been sold and included as standard software in Japanese Sharp notebook computers such as the Mebuis.
The EVA format is comparable with the Macromedia Flash format except that the files are 13 times smaller than Flash counterparts. A ten minute animation produced in the EVA format is only around 500 KB whereas the same animation produced in Flash would be several MB in size.
Although very popular in Japan, the Animator software itself only works in Japanese versions of Windows and has never been ported to the English versions.

thumb|right|upright Richard Marsden Pankhurst (May, 1834 – 5 July 1898) was an English barrister and supporter of women's rights.
Pankhurst was the son of Henry Francis Pankhurst (1806-1873) and Margaret Marsden (1803-1879). He was born in Stoke but spent most of his life in Manchester and London.  He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and Owens College of Manchester. In 1858 he graduated BA from the University of London and in 1859 was awarded LLB with Honours. In 1863 he graduated LLD with gold medal. He was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1867 and joined the Northern Assizes circuit. He was also a member of the Bar of the County Palatine of Lancaster Court.
Following qualification he was a founder member of the Manchester Liberal Association, although he was subsequently to fall out with the Liberals.  He campaigned for multiple causes, including free speech, universal free secular education, republicanism, home rule for the Irish, independence for India, nationalisation of land, the disestablishment of the Church of England and the abolition of the House of Lords.  He established a National Society for Women's Suffrage, drafted the Women's Disabilities Removal Bill (the first women's suffrage bill in England) and was author of the bill which became the Married Women's Property Act (1882) which gave wives absolute control over their property and earnings.
He married Emmeline Goulden, better known as Emmeline Pankhurst, who was some 24 years younger than he was, in 1879. With her, he was instrumental in establishing the Independent Labour Party.  Together they formed the Women's Franchise League in 1889.  They were part of a political circle which included Keir Hardie, Annie Besant, William Morris and George Bernard Shaw.  They were present at the Bloody Sunday riot in Trafalgar Square.
Known as the "Red Doctor," he stood for Parliament in 1883 as candidate for Manchester and in 1885 for Rotherhithe, Kent, both times unsuccessfully.  His controversial views did not win him many clients, but did afford him a place of great respect in the Independent Labour Party, even long after his sudden death, from stomach ulcers, at the age of 64.  
He was father to Adela Pankhurst, Christabel Pankhurst and Sylvia Pankhurst. He was buried alongside his parents in Brooklands Cemetery, Sale, Cheshire, where there is a headstone bearing their names.

[[Applied probability]]

CATEGORIES: Applied probability

Much research involving probability is done under the auspices of applied probability, the application of probability theory to other scientific and engineering domains.  However, while such research is motivated (to some degree) by applied problems, it is usually the mathematical aspects of the problems that are of most interest to researchers (as is typical of applied mathematics in general).
Applied probabilists are particularly concerned with the application of stochastic processes, and probability more generally, to the natural, applied and social sciences, including biology, physics (including astronomy), chemistry, computer science and information technology, and economics. 
Another area of interest is in engineering: particularly in areas of uncertainty, risk management, Probabilistic design, and Quality assurance.

In 2011, the Bali Cultural Agency estimates that the number of people still using Balinese language in their daily lives on the Bali Island does not exceed 1 million, as in urban areas their parents only introduce Indonesian language or even English, while daily conversations in the institutions and the mass media have disappeared. The written form of the Balinese language is increasingly unfamiliar and most Balinese people use the Balinese language only as a spoken tool with mixing of Indonesian language in their daily conversation. But in the transmigration areas outside Bali Island, Balinese language is extensively used and believed to play an important role in the survival of the language.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/03/30/balinese-language-will-never-die.html |title=Balinese language ‘will never die’ |date=March 30, 2012[/tpl]

[tpl]Nihongo|Azai Hisamasa|浅井 久政|Azai Hisamasa|extra=1526 – September 23, 1573[/tpl] was a son of Azai Sukemasa and the second head of the Azai clan.
Hisamasa became the head of the clan in 1542 after his father died, but unlike his father, he was never a strong leader. Losing domains against Rokkaku clan, he instead became a Rokkaku retainer. Hisamasa's retainers had enough and after his son Azai Nagamasa won the Battle of Norada against a force at least twice the size of his led by Rokkaku Yoshikata to win back independence, they forced Hisamasa into retirement.
Yet, this retirement was not complete and Hisamasa managed to hold some sway of the clan. This surfaced in 1570 after Oda Nobunaga who was allied with his son, Azai Nagamasa, attacked Asakura Yoshikage who had supported Hisamasa against enemies like the Rokkaku clan. Hating Nobunaga for his personality, Hisamasa demanded that the Azai clan pay back the support of Asakura clan and forced a war by breaking the alliance. It is thought that Nagamasa opposed him and believed that the alliance could somehow be mended over time since he refused to divorce his wife, Oichi, but he failed to gain enough support to overturn Hisamasa.
On 1573, Odani Castle was besieged by Nobunaga's forces, and facing a loss Hisamasa committed seppuku.

In the 1582 siege of Takamatsu (備中高松城の戦い), Toyotomi Hideyoshi laid siege to Takamatsu Castle, which was controlled by the Mōri clan. He diverted a nearby river with dikes to surround and flood the castle, leading to a relatively speedy surrender. He also constructed towers on barges from which his arquebusiers could keep up a constant rate of fire and be unhindered themselves by the flooding. As the battle grew more intense, the garrison received reinforcements from the Mōri, Kikkawa and Kobayakawa clans, and Hideyoshi sent for aid from his lord Oda Nobunaga. In response, Nobunaga sent a contingent of men west, to make their way to Takamatsu, while he himself stopped at the Honnō-ji for a time; during this stay, he would be betrayed and killed.
Hideyoshi soon learned of the death of his lord, which encouraged him to hurry the arrangement of surrender terms. Shimizu Muneharu, the castle's commander, was forced to commit suicide in a boat on the artificial lake created by the flooding, in full view.

[tpl]nihongo|Takeda Katsuyori|武田 勝頼||extra=1546 – 3 April 1582[/tpl] was a Japanese daimyo of the Sengoku Period, who was famed as the head of the Takeda clan and the successor to the legendary warlord Takeda Shingen. He was the son of Shingen by the [tpl]nihongo|Suwa goryōnin|諏訪御料人||extra=real name unknown[/tpl], the daughter of Suwa Yorishige. Katsuyori's children included Takeda Nobukatsu and Katsuchika.http://www2.harimaya.com/sengoku/html/takeda.html
Katsuyori, first known as [tpl]nihongo|Suwa Shirō Katsuyori|諏訪四郎勝頼[/tpl], succeeded to his mother's Suwa clan and gained Takatō Castle as the seat of his domain. After his elder brother Takeda Yoshinobu died, Katsuyori's son Nobukatsu became heir to the Takeda clan, making Katsuyori the true ruler of the Takeda clan.  He took charge of the family after the death of Shingen and fought Tokugawa Ieyasu at Takatenjin in 1574 and at Nagashino in 1575. He captured Takatenjin, which even his father could not; this gained him the support of the Takeda clan, but he suffered a terrible loss at Nagashino, succumbing to one of the earliest recorded uses of volley fire (Oda Nobunaga's 3000 guns), in which he lost a large part of his forces as well as a number of his generals.
Katsuyori incurred the wrath of the Hōjō family by helping Uesugi Kagekatsu against Uesugi Kagetora who was Hōjō Ujiyasu's seventh son, adopted by and heir to Uesugi Kenshin.
He lost Takatenjin in 1581  and this led clans like Kiso and Anayama to withdraw their support. His forces were destroyed by the combined armies of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu at Temmokuzan in 1582, after which Katsuyori, his wife, his son Nobukatsu and several maids of their retinue committed their ritual suicide, known as seppuku.
There has been rumours that Oda Nobunaga had great pleasure in seeing Katsuyori's severed head, since the Takeda clan had always been his biggest rival.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]

Three card brag is a 16th-century  British card game, and the British national representative of the vying or "bluffing" family of gambling games.Oxford Dictionary of Card games, p. 31, David Parlett ISBN 0-19-869173-4 Brag is a direct descendant of the Elizabethan game of PrimeroThe complete Hoyle's games, p. 207, Edmond Hoyle, Lawrence Hawkins Dawson ISBN 1-85326-316-8 and one of the several ancestors to poker, just varying in betting style and hand rankings.
The game is very popular in Trinidad, India, Bangladesh and Nepal, where it is known both as "Flush" and "Teen Patti" (literally translated from Hindi as "three cards"), played with some minor variations. At large gatherings and especially during festival times, it is the game of choice since many people of different skills can play together and have fun. It is also a very popular game among British fairground showmen, who usually get together at the bigger fairs and play for quite high stakes.
Three card brag was played in the film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels directed by Guy Ritchie, where it was played without table stakes.

CATEGORIES: Fictional valleys, Fictional Asian countries, Fictional populated places in China, Mythological kingdoms, empires, and countries, Tibet in fiction, Utopias, Life extension

Shangri-La is a fictional place described in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon by British author James Hilton. Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a lamasery, enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, and particularly a mythical Himalayan utopia — a permanently happy land, isolated from the outside world. In the novel Lost Horizon, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance. The word also evokes the imagery of exoticism of the Orient. In the ancient Tibetan scriptures, existence of seven such places is mentioned as Nghe-Beyul Khimpalung. Khembalung is one of several beyuls ("hidden lands" similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by Padmasambhava in the 8th century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard 1978).
Many scholars believe that Shangri-La is Shambhala, a mythical kingdom in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.[tpl]cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url= |accessdate=27 November 2012[/tpl]

In software development, Small Matter of Programming (SMOP) or Simple Matter of Programming is a phrase used to ironically indicate that a suggested feature or design change would in fact require a great deal of effort; it often implies that the person proposing the feature underestimates its cost. Such underestimated costs are common during cost estimation, particularly near the beginning of a project. The Jargon File describes an SMOPSimple Matter of Programming (Jargon File, version 4.4.7) as:

The Act of Security 1704 (also referred to as the Act for the Security of the Kingdom) was a response by the Parliament of Scotland to the Parliament of England's Act of Settlement 1701. Queen Anne's last surviving child, William, Duke of Gloucester had died in 1700, and both parliaments needed to find a Protestant successor.  The English Parliament had settled on Electress Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of King James VI of Scotland, without consulting the Scottish Parliament.
The response of the Scottish Parliament was to pass a bill in 1703[tpl]cite book | last=Lynch|first=Michael | title=Scotland: A New History | publisher=Pimlico | year=1992|isbn=0-7126-9893-0 |pages=311[/tpl] requiring that, on the death of Queen Anne without issue, the three Estates of the Parliament were to appoint a Protestant successor from the descendants of the Scottish kings, but not the English successor unless various economic, political and religious conditions were met.  The bill was refused Royal Assent by the Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland.
The following year, 1704, the bill became an Act after the Scottish Parliament refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the Duke of Marlborough's army in the War of the Spanish Succession unless Royal Assent was given.
The English Parliament retaliated with the 1705 Alien Act,[tpl]cite web|publisher=parliament.uk |title= Westminster passes the 'Alien Act', 1705 | url =http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/03_05_alien.html | accessdate = 2009-02-08 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] threatening to cut trade and free movement between the two countries, unless negotiations opened leading either to the repeal of the Act of Security, or (as in the event happened) to the Act of Union in 1707. The end result was the Union of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain, approximately one hundred years after the Union of the Crowns.
Although deemed void[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] by the Act of Union, the Parliament of Great Britain passed an Act (Repeal of Certain Scotch Acts 1707 6 Ann. c. 32) explicitly repealing this Act together with the Act anent Peace and War.

On May 1, 2002, this group started removing landmines in the Shomali Plain north of Kabul in Afghanistan. In 2003, Roots of Peace began a major replanting campaign targeted at revitalizing Afghanistan’s formerly world-renowned table grape industry. The organization is also working in many other countries such as Cambodia, Croatia and Iraq.  It is supported by the United Nations, the United States State Department, and many other commercial entities such as Warner Brothers and Palm, Inc.
Roots of Peace received the Skoll Foundation Award for Social Entrepreneur 2006. This award for $765,000 was presented by Jeffrey Skoll, Founder of eBay, Robert Redford, Ben Kingsley and Al Gore at the Said International School of Business in Oxford, England.
Roots of Peace has raised the necessary funds to remove landmines in the Shomali Plains and empowered the Afghan farmers to harvest/export over 90,000 metric tons of fresh grapes and raisins to India, Pakistan, Dubai, Ukraine, and Russia. This MINES TO VINES initiative has successfully replaced the scourge of landmines in the Shomali Plains region of Afghanistan with the bountiful nectar of grapes.

In 1558, Suzuki Shigeteru, lord of Terabe Castle, defected from the Imagawa in favor of an alliance with Oda Nobunaga. The Imagawa responded by sending an army under the command of Matsudaira Motoyasu, a young vassal of Imagawa Yoshimoto. Terabe Castle was the first of a series of battles waged against the Oda clan.
Motoyasu's forces attacked Terabe Castle, but were driven off by reinforcements sent by Nobunaga. Motoyasu then continued his campaign against other Oda clan possessions.
Matsudaira Motoyasu would later change his name to Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Siege of Terabe Castle was his first battle.

[[Subobject classifier]]
CATEGORIES: Topos theory, Objects (category theory)

In category theory, a subobject classifier is a special object Ω of a category; intuitively, the subobjects of an object X correspond to the morphisms from X to Ω. Intuitively, as the name suggests, what a subobject classifier does is to identify/classify subobjects of a given object according to which elements belong to the subobject in question. Because of this role, the subobject classifier is also referred to as the "truth value object". In fact the way in which the subobject classifier classifies subobjects of a given object, is by assigning the values true to elements belonging to the subobject in question, and false to elements not belonging to the subobject. This is why the subobject classifier is widely used in the categorical description of logic.

Pramono, hal 148, 2013) is the language of the Javanese people from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java, in Indonesia. There are also pockets of Javanese speakers in the northern coast of western Java. It is the native language of more than 75,500,000 people (more than 30% of total population in Indonesia).
Javanese is part of the Austronesian languages, but it is otherwise not particularly close to other languages and is difficult to classify, though not too dissimilar from neighbouring languages such as Malay, Sundanese, Madurese and Balinese. Most speakers of Javanese also speak Indonesian (a standardized form of Malay) for official and commercial purposes, as well as a means to communicate with non-Javanese Indonesians.
There are speakers of Javanese in Malaysia (concentrated in the states of Selangor and Johor) and Singapore. Some people of Javanese descent in Suriname (the Dutch colony of Suriname until 1975) speak a creole descendant of the language.

[tpl]nihongo|Tokugawa Yorinobu|徳川 頼宣||April 28, 1602 – February 19, 1671[/tpl] was a Japanese daimyo of the early Edo period. 
Born under the name Nagafukumaru, he was the 10th son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by his concubine Oman-no-kata. On December 8, 1603, Yorinobu received the fief of Mito, then rated at 200,000 koku, as his fief. Mito had formerly belonged to his older brother, Takeda Nobuyoshi. Following his stipend increase to 250,000 koku in October 1604, he came of age on September 12, 1606, taking the name Yorimasa, and receiving the court rank of junior 4th, lower grade (ju-shi-i-ge) and the title of Hitachi no Suke. On January 6, 1610, he was transferred to a 500,000 koku fief in Suruga and Tōtōmi Provinces (thereby founding Sunpu Domain centered around Sunpu Castle), and took the name Yorinobu. However, after a little under a decade in Suruga, he was transferred to the 550,000 koku Wakayama Domain on August 27, 1619, following the transfer of the previous rulers, the Asano clan, to Hiroshima, in Aki Province. Yorinobu thus became the founder of the Kii branch of the Tokugawa family. Yorinobu's wife was the daughter of Katō Kiyomasa. By the end of his life, Yorinobu had achieved junior 2nd court rank (ju-ni-i), as well as holding the title of dainagon ("major counselor").
Yorinobu had four children: his successor Tokugawa Mitsusada, Yorizumi, the founder of the Iyo-Saijo Domain, Inaba-hime, who married Ikeda Mitsunaka of the Tottori Domain, and Matsuhime, who married Matsudaira Nobuhira of the Yoshii Domain.
He was the father of Mitsusada and Yorizumi. Following his death, he was referred to by the title Nanryū-in.
In 1915, Yorinobu was posthumously promoted to senior 2nd court rank (shō-ni-i).

Tadaharu was the 3rd son of Torii Tadamasa, the lord of the Yamagata Domain. As his father died before a successor was named from among his sons, the Torii family's holdings were confiscated. However, because of his grandfather Torii Mototada's distinguished service, the family name was restored, and Tadaharu was made lord of the Takatō fief, with an income of 32,000 koku.
Tadaharu was first famed for his wise rulership of Takatō; however, his rule soon became oppressive, especially after he killed seven of his senior retainers who admonished him. Many of the peasants from Takatō fled to Tokugawa-controlled tenryō territory in 1654. In 1663, while serving at Osaka Castle, Tadaharu was murdered by his doctor Matsui Jukaku.
The family headship was passed to Tadaharu's eldest son Tadanori.

Kawi (from Sanskrit: kavi, "poet") is a literary and prose language on the islands of Java, Bali, and Lombok, based on Old Javanese, a language with a sizable vocabulary of Sanskrit loanwords. Kawi is the ancestor language of modern Javanese.  The name "kawi" is derived from the root ku, which in Sanskrit means “poet”, and, in derived forms, a “wise, educated man”. The syllabic meter of Kawi poetry is sekar kawi, which means “flowers of the language”, sekar itself deriving from the Sanskrit "sekhara" (“garland”).[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]  All Javanese languages are hierarchical and stratified, with strict social conventions for appropriate language subsets to be used for one's superiors or social and cultural functions.

The Shooting of Amadou Diallo occurred on February 4, 1999, when Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was shot and killed by four New York City Police Department plain-clothed officers: Sean Carroll, Richard Murphy, Edward McMellon and Kenneth Boss, who fired a combined total of 41 shots, 19 of which struck Diallo, outside his apartment at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of The Bronx. The four were part of the now-defunct Street Crimes Unit. All four officers were acquitted at trial in Albany, New York.Medaglia, Angelica. "Amadou Diallo". The New York Times. Retrieved 2011-03-28.
Diallo was unarmed at the time of the shooting, and a firestorm of controversy erupted subsequent to the event as the circumstances of the shooting prompted outrage both within and outside New York City. Issues such as police brutality, racial profiling, and contagious shooting were central to the ensuing controversy.

Madurese is a language of the Madurese people of Madura Island and eastern Java, Indonesia; it is also spoken on the neighbouring small Kangean Islands and Sapudi Islands, as well as from migrants to other parts of Indonesia, namely the Tapal Kuda ("horseshoe") area of neighbouring Java (comprising Pasuruan, Surabaya, Malang to Banyuwangi), the Masalembu Islands, and even some on Kalimantan.  The Kangean dialect may be a separate language. It was traditionally written in the Javanese script, but the Latin script is now more commonly used. The number of speakers, though shrinking, is estimated to be 8-13 million.
Links between Bali–Sasak languages and Madurese are more evident with the "low" form (common form).  There are some common words between Madurese and Filipino languages as well as between Madurese and Banjar.  There are several dialects.

[[Nan Britton]]
CATEGORIES: 1896 births, 1991 deaths, People from Marion, Ohio, American memoirists, American women writers, Warren G. Harding, People from Clackamas County, Oregon

Nan P. "Nanny" Britton (November 9, 1896 – March 21, 1991) was a figure associated with the Presidency of Warren G. Harding because she publicly claimed that Harding had fathered her illegitimate daughter shortly before his election as President.
Born in 1896 in Marion, Ohio, Britton developed an obsession with Harding, a friend of her father. As a young girl, her bedroom walls were covered with Harding's pictures from local papers and magazines. While not even 16 years old, she would loiter near his Marion Daily Star building in Marion, Ohio, hoping to see him on his walk home from work.
Nan's father, Dr. Britton, spoke to Harding about his daughter's infatuation, and Harding met with her, claiming he told her that some day she would find the man of her dreams. At the time, Harding was already involved in a passionate affair with Carrie Fulton Phillips, wife of James Phillips, co-owner of a local department store. After she graduated from high school in 1914, Britton moved to New York City, to begin a career as a secretary. However, she claimed she also began an intimate relationship with Warren G. Harding.
Following Harding's death, Britton wrote what is considered to be the first kiss-and-tell book. In The President's Daughter, published in 1928, she claimed she had been Harding's mistress all during his presidency, naming him as the father of her daughter, Elizabeth Ann (1919–2005). One famous passage told of their making love in a coat closet in the executive office of the White House.
According to Britton, Harding had promised to support their daughter, but after his sudden death in 1923, his wife refused to honor the obligation. Britton insisted she wrote the book to earn money to the support her daughter and to champion the rights of illegitimate children. She brought a lawsuit (Britton v. Klunk), but she was unable to provide any concrete evidence and was shaken by the vicious personal attacks made by Congressman Grant Mouser during the cross examination, which cost her the case.Carl Sferraza Anthony, author of Florence Harding, wrote that court transcripts in Toledo, Ohio, show that Mouser referred to Britton as a "degenerate and pervert", then "brought (Florence Kling Harding) in by using Warren's 'love of his good wife' against a 'distorted ... deranged ... demented ... diabolical' Nan who had no respect for the marriage tie ..."
Britton's memoirs seem sincere, but her portrayal of Harding and his colloquialisms paints a picture of a crude womanizer. In his 1931 book Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote that on the testimony of Britton's book, Harding's private life was "one of cheap sex episodes" and that "one sees with deadly clarity the essential ordinariness of the man, the commonness of his 'Gee dearie' and 'Say, you darling'." Britton's book was among those irreverently reviewed by Dorothy Parker for The New Yorker magazine as part of her famous Constant Reader column, under the title "An American DuBarry."
Nan Britton died in 1991 in Clackamas County, Oregon, at the age of 94. She insisted to the very last that Warren G. Harding was the father of her daughter.

Ama Dablam is a mountain in the Himalaya range of eastern Nepal. The main peak is [tpl]convert|6856|m|ft|0[/tpl], the lower western peak is [tpl]convert|6170|m|ft|0[/tpl]. Ama Dablam means "Mother's necklace"; the long ridges on each side like the arms of a mother (ama) protecting her child, and the hanging glacier thought of as the dablam, the traditional double-pendant containing pictures of the gods, worn by Sherpa women.[ref]
</ref> For several days, Ama Dablam dominates the eastern sky for anyone trekking to [[Mount Everest]] basecamp.
Ama Dablam was first climbed on 13 March 1961 by Mike Gill (NZ), Barry Bishop (USA), Mike Ward (UK) and Wally Romanes (NZ) via the Southwest Ridge.  They were well-acclimatised to altitude, having wintered over at 5800 metres near the base of the peak as part of the Silver Hut Scientific Expedition of 1960-61, led by Sir Edmund Hillary.[tpl]Cite journal  | last = Kennedy  | first = Michael  | authorlink =   | author2 = Michael Ward  | title = Mountain Profile: Ama Dablam  | journal = Alpinist Magazine  | volume =   | issue = X  | page = 26  | publisher = Alpinist LLC  | location = Jackson, WY, USA  | date = March 2005  | url =  http://www.alpinist.com/doc/ALP10/profile-ama-dablam | issn = 1540-725X  | doi =   | accessdate = [/tpl]
Ama Dablam is the third most popular Himalayan peak for permitted expeditions.  The most popular route by far is the Southwest Ridge (right skyline in the photo).[ref]
</ref> Climbers typically set up three camps along the ridge with camp 3 just below and to the right of the hanging [[glacier]], the Dablam. Any ice that calves off the glacier typically goes left, away from the camp. However, a 2006 avalanche proved otherwise. A climbing permit and a liaison officer are required when attempting Ama Dablam. As with Mt. Everest, the best climbing months are April–May (before the [[monsoon]]) and September–October.

[[Makassarese language]]
CATEGORIES: Sulawesi languages

Makassarese (sometimes spelled Makasar, Makassar, or Macassar) is a language used by the Makassarese people in South Sulawesi island (Celebes) in Indonesia. It is a member of the Austronesian language family of the South Sulawesi group, and thus closely related to, among others, Buginese.
Although Makassarese is now often written in Latin script, it is still widely written in its own distinctive script, also called Lontara, which once was used also to write important documents in Bugis and Mandar, two related language from Sulawesi.
The Makassar symbols are written using mostly straight oblique lines and dots. In spite of its quite distinctive appearance, it is derived from the ancient Brahmi scripts of India. Like other descendants of that script, each consonant has an inherent vowel "a", which is not marked. Other vowels can be indicated by adding one of five diacritics above, below, or on either side of each consonant.
Some common words/phrases in the Makassar language, transcribed in the Latin script, are as follows ( '  = glottal stop):

CATEGORIES: Anabaptist denominations in North America, Christian denominations established in the 19th century, Montgomery County, Ohio, Religious organizations established in 1848, 1848 establishments in the United States, 1962 disestablishments in the United States

The Church of God (New Dunkers) is a now-extinct body that divided  in 1848 from the Schwarzenau Brethren (The group originating from the Schwarzenau Brethren were also called 'Fraternity of German Baptists', or 'German Baptist Brethren', referenced as Dunkers or Tunkers. The group's official name changed in the 1880s to 'Church of the Brethren').
The New Dunkers appear indebted to Peter Eyman for their origin. In the Fall of 1827, the "Dunker" Church in Montgomery County, Ohio, was organized by Peter Eyman (ca. 1805–1852), who was the church's first preacher. Then Eyman moved from Ohio in 1828 to Carroll County, Indiana, serving in what became the Bachelor's Run and Lower Deer Creek churches.
Bachelor's Run was the first Brethren Church in Carroll County. The congregation was organized by Peter Eyman in 1829. In 1838 trouble began between Eyman and fellow minister Peter Replogle, which resulted in a division of church territory. Replogle started the Deer Creek congregation. Around 1845 Peter Eyman and another minister, George Patton, advocated "variant practices" for which they were disfellowshipped by the Annual Conference in 1848.
The Eyman/Patton group were popularly known as the New Dunkers, but they called themselves the Church of God, insisting that Bible things should be called by Bible names. They took the position that Church of God was the only scriptural church name. In doctrine and practice, they were close to the Brethren from whom they evolved, faithfully observing trine forward immersion, feet washing, the holy kiss, anointing with oil, etc. In the 1940s there were eight churches with about 500 members. The Church of God (New Dunkers) disbanded in August 1962.

Highway 16 is the British Columbia, Canada, section of the Yellowhead Highway. The highway closely follows the path of the northern B.C. alignment of the Canadian National Railway. The number "16" was first given to the highway in 1942, and originally, the route that the highway took was more to the north of today's highway, and it was not as long as it is now. Highway 16 originally ran from New Hazelton east to an obscure location known as Aleza Lake. In 1947, Highway 16's western end was moved from New Hazelton to the coastal city of Prince Rupert, and in 1953, the highway was extended east to Prince George. In 1969, further alignment east into Yellowhead Pass was opened to traffic after being constructed up through 1968 and raised to all-weather standards in 1969. Highway 16's alignment on the Haida Gwaii was commissioned in 1984, with BC Ferries beginning service along Highway 16 to the Haida Gwaii the following year.
A series of murders and disappearances has given the stretch between Prince Rupert and Prince George the name Highway of Tears.

[[Edging (climbing)]]
CATEGORIES: Climbing techniques

Edging is a climbing technique involving the placement of the very edge (either inside or outside edge) of the climbing shoe on a sharp hold.  Edging is the most simple and most common approach for standing on holds but, even so, requires some practice to obtain the very best footing. On smaller holds, it becomes something of an exercise in precision.
An alternative to edging is toeing-in, where the toes are placed on the hold.  This requires strong toes but might be preferable on very small holds, particularly in small pockets.
Another alternative is smearing, where the ball of the foot is, literally, smeared onto the surface of the rock in absence of any definite holds.  Here one relies upon friction created at the sole of the shoe.

The Crowsnest Highway, also known as the Interprovincial or, in British Columbia, the Southern Trans-Provincial, is an east-west highway, [tpl]convert|1161|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, through the southern parts of British Columbia and Alberta, providing the shortest highway connection between British Columbia's Lower Mainland and southeast Alberta.

The highway, which is mostly two lanes, was officially established in 1932, mainly following a mid-19th century gold rush trail originally traced out by an engineer named Edgar Dewdney.  It takes its name from the Crowsnest Pass, the location at which the highway crosses the Continental Divide between British Columbia and Alberta.  
In British Columbia, the first segment of the highway between the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 5A is locally known as the Hope-Princeton Highway. In Alberta, the highway forms concurrencies with both the Red Coat Trail and the CANAMEX Corridor from Highway 2 west of Fort Macleod to Highway 4 at the eastern limits of Lethbridge.

B.|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-866196-7[/tpl] It is very common throughout Europe and Asia. It is found in forested areas, both coniferous and mixed woodland where it feeds on seeds of all kinds, especially of alder and conifers.
It can be distinguished from other similar finches by the color of the plumage. The upper parts are greyish green and the under parts grey-streaked white. Its wings are black with a conspicuous yellow wing bar, and the tail is black with yellow sides. The male has a mainly yellow face and breast, with a neat black cap. Female and young birds have a greyish green head and no cap. It is a trusting, sociable and active bird. The song of this bird is a pleasant mix of twitters and trills. For these reasons it is often raised in captivity.
These birds have an unusual migration pattern as every few years in winter they migrate  southwards in large numbers. The reasons for this behavior are not known but may be related to climatic factors and above all the availability of food. In this way overwintering populations can thrive where food is abundant. This small finch is an acrobatic feeder, often hanging upside-down like a tit. It will visit garden bird feeding stations.

The Scottish Crossbill (Loxia scotica) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is endemic to the Caledonian Forests of Scotland, and is the only vertebrate unique to the United Kingdom.In the past, this claim has been made on behalf of other species such as the Red Grouse (now considered to be a sub-species of Willow Ptarmigan) and Irish Stoat (Mustela erminea hibernica), also now considered to be a sub-species of Stoat. Loxia scotica 's position as a true species is a matter of debate but the current consensus is that it does have this status (see for example Miles and Jackman (1991) pp. 21–30 and Benvie (2004) p. 55.) The position of the freshwater fish the Vendace Coregonus vandesius is disputed, with many authorities considering it to be a synonym of Coregonus albula.Adams, William Mark (2003) Future Nature. British Association of Nature Conservationists p. 30. Retrieved 14 July 2009. This source lists the UK's endemic species as being "14 lichens, 14 bryophytes, 1 fern, 21 higher plants, 16 invertebrates and 1 vertebrate (the Scottish crossbill)."Perhaps because endemic vertebrates are all but absent from the UK neither SNH nor JNCC appear to provide a definitive "list" but it is clear that the Scottish Crossbill is the only endemic bird, (Gooders (1994) p. 273. and "Scottish Crossbill: Loxia Scotica (pdf) JNCC. Retrieved 7 July 2009.) and that there are no endemic freshwater fish (Maitland, P. and Lyle A.A. (1996) "Threatened freshwater fishes of Great Britain" in Kirchofer, A. and Hefti, D. (1996) Conservation of Endangered Freshwater Fish in Europe. Basel. Birkhauser.) or mammals ("The British Mammals list" ppne.co.uk. Retrieved 7 July 2009.)  in Britain. There are too few amphibians and reptiles native to the UK for there to be any doubt that no endemic species exist. The position is implied, although not stated by SNH in their Information and Advisory Note Number 49 "Priority species in Scotland: animals" Retrieved 7 July 2009. See also Myers, Norman (2003) "Conservation of Biodiversity: How are We Doing?" (pdf) The Environmentalist 23 pp. 9–15. Retrieved 7 July 2009. This publication confirms there is only one "endemic non-ﬁsh vertebrate species" in the British Isles, although it fails to identify the species concerned.

In fact, Alu elements are the most abundant transposable elements in the human genome. They are derived from the small cytoplasmic 7SL RNA, a component of the signal recognition particle. The event, when a copy of the 7SL RNA became a precursor of the Alu elements, took place in the genome of an ancestor of Supraprimates.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kriegs JO, Churakov G, Jurka J, Brosius J, Schmitz J |title=Evolutionary history of 7SL RNA-derived SINEs in Supraprimates |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=158–61 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17307271 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2007.02.002 | url=http://zmbe2.uni-muenster.de/expath/articles/31_Kriegs_TiG.pdf[/tpl]

[[Parrot Crossbill]]
CATEGORIES: Loxia, Birds of Europe

The Parrot Crossbill (Loxia pytyopsittacus) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae.
This bird breeds in the pine forests of northwest Europe and into western Russia. There is also a small population in Scotland, adding to the difficulty of distinguishing it from Red Crossbill and the endemic Scottish Crossbill, both of which breed within its range.
This crossbill is mainly resident, but will irrupt south and west if its food source fails.  This species will form flocks outside the breeding season, often mixed with other crossbills.
The crossbills are characterised by the mandibles crossing at their tips, which gives the group its English name. They are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone. The Parrot Crossbill is a specialist feeder on the cones of Scots pine.
Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.
This species is difficult to separate from Red and Scottish Crossbills, and plumage distinctions are negligible.

The bill is thicker than those of its relatives, and the crossed tips are often not readily apparent. Extreme care is needed to identify this species. The deeper, harder choop or tyuup call is probably the best indicator.
Some pine-feeding populations currently assigned to Red Crossbill in southern Europe may possibly be better referred to either this species or alternatively to new species in their own right, but as yet, research into them is still at a very early stage.

CATEGORIES: Loxia, Birds of Ukraine, Animals described in 1758

The Red Crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae, also known as the Common Crossbill in Eurasia. Crossbills have distinctive mandibles, crossed at the tips, which enable them to extract seeds from conifer cones and other fruits.
Adults are often brightly coloured, with red or orange males and green or yellow females, but there is wide variation in colour, beak size and shape, and call types, leading to different classifications of variants, some of which have been named as subspecies.

CATEGORIES: 1898 deaths, Military leaders of the New Zealand Wars, Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi, Muaūpoko, New Zealand Māori public servants, Recipients of the New Zealand Cross (1869), Year of birth missing

Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui (died 15 April 1898) was Māori military commander and noted ally of the government forces during the New Zealand Wars. First known as Te Rangihiwinui, he was later known as Te Keepa, Meiha Keepa, Major Keepa or Major Kemp.
Te Rangihiwinui's father was Mahuera Paki Tanguru-o-te-rangi, a leader of the Muaūpoko iwi (tribe). His mother was Rere-o-maki, sister of Te Anaua, a leader of Ngāti Ruaka, a subtribe of Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi. Te Rangihiwinui was probably born in the early 1820s near Opiki in the Horowhenua. His early years were spent under the threat of tribal warfare resulting from the invasion of their tribal land by the Ngati Toa led by Te Rauparaha. Keepa's father was an early supporter of New Zealand Company settlement established at Wanganui and served as a constable in the Armed Police Force.
During the First Taranaki War, Te Keepa made clear his continuing loyalty to the government. In 1864, the Māori tribes on the Upper Wanganui River converted to Hauhauism and threatened to invade Wanganui town. Te Keepa led the tribes of the lower river to defend the town.  The result was the Battle of Moutoa Island and a substantial defeat for the Hauhau on 14 May 1864.[tpl]DNZB|Dreaver|Anthony|1t64|Te Rangihiwinui, Te Keepa|1 September 2012[/tpl]
This was the start of six years of warfare for Te Keepa, always fighting on the side of the Pākehā government, usually working closely with Captain Thomas McDonnell. In February 1865, Te Keepa and his force of Wanganui Māori warriors took part in the attack on Ohoutahi Pa, a major Hauhau stronghold. Following the murder of the missionary Volkner, they were shipped to the other side of the country, to Opotiki. However they soon returned to Taranaki and were involved in the capture of Wereroa Pa and then the relief of Pipiriki.
Te Keepa gradually built up a personal contingent of between one and two hundred warriors, men who were paid by the government but whose loyalty was to him and his mana as a fighting chieftain. In 1868, he and his men were involved with the insurgency of Titokowaru.  Te Keepa commanded the rearguard   during the retreat from Te Ngutu o Te Manu after the government forces had been defeated and again in similar circumstances after the Battle of Moturoa. Te Keepa commanded the force pursuing Titokowaru after he abandoned his pa at Tauranga Ika.  It was the first time that British soldiers, officers and men had served under a Māori commander, by this time Te Keepa had been promoted to the rank of major.
As soon as Titokowaru ceased to be threat, Te Keepa and his men were transported to the East Coast to join in the pursuit of Te Kooti. Such was his reputation that the attack on Te Porere near Tongariro was delayed until Te Keepa and his men arrived; they were marching up the Wanganui River in the face of snowstorms and volcanic eruptions.
The final pursuit of Te Kooti through the Ureweras was largely handed over to Te Keepa and another Māori war leader, Ropata Wahawaha. He and his men returned to Wanganui in 1871.  Over the following years he was honoured with the Queen's Sword of Honour in 1870, the New Zealand Cross in 1874 and the New Zealand War Medal in 1876.
In 1871 Te Keepa was appointed as a land purchase officer in Wanganui.  He saw this as an opportunity to correct some of the wrongs done to his people during his childhood, a chance to regain some of the land they had lost to the Ngati Raukawa by conquest. This almost brought the tribes to war, Te Keepa threatened to call upon his personal following of warriors if the government did not back up his decisions. There were some violent clashes before the issue went in his favour.
In 1880, Te Keepa set up a Māori trust to protect Māori land from European buyers. A large area of inland Wanganui was declared off limits to all Europeans.  This provoked the government, but Te Keepa's large personal following of warriors meant they were very cautious in dealing with him. In addition, he had the support of some members of the government, including the Native Minister, John Ballance.
During his remaining years Te Keepa sought to unify the two races as one people based on equality and respect.
He first contested the Western Maori electorate in the [tpl]NZ election link|1871[/tpl], the second time that elections in Māori electorates were held.

Paweł Włodkowic (Paulus Vladimiri in Latin) (ca. 1370 – October 9, 1435) was a distinguished scholar, jurist and rector of the Cracow Academy who defended Poland and native non-Christian tribes against the Teutonic Knights and its policies of conquest.
Though it is commonly assumed that "Włodkowic" was a surname, it was in fact a patronymic denoting that he was the son of a certain Włodko or Włodzimierz. He was born in Brudzeń Duży near Dobrzyń nad Wisłą and studied at Prague University, where he took degrees in 1393. He continued studying law at Padova, Italy, in 1404–1408. 
In 1411 or 1412 he was made a doctor of canon law at the Academy in Kraków, where he also began to lecture. He was influenced by the philosophies of William of Ockham, Matthew of Cracow and Stanisław of Skarbimierz. In 1413 he served as King Jagiełło's emissary at Buda, Hungary, during disputes with the Teutonic Order. In 1414–1415 he became rector and in 1418 prorector of Cracow Academy.
Paweł Włodkowic represented Poland at the 1414 Council of Constance, where he delivered a thesis about the power of the Pope and the Emperor, the Tractatus de potestate papae et imperatoris respectu infidelium (Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor Respecting Infidels). In it he drew the thesis that pagan and Christian nations could coexist in peace and criticized the Teutonic Order for its wars of conquest of native non-Christian peoples in Prussia and Lithuania. Due to his influence, in 1421 the Pope sent Antionio Zeno to investigate the Teutonic Order and its activities. 
In 1420 Paweł Włodkowic represented Poland at a conference between Poland and the Teutonic Order held in Wrocław under the aegis of Sigismund of Luxemburg.
As early as the beginning of the 15th century, along with Stanisław of Skarbimierz, Włodkowic strongly supported the idea of conciliarism and pioneered the notion of peaceful coexistence among nations – a forerunner of modern theories of human rights. Throughout his political, diplomatic and university career, Paweł Włodkowic expressed the view that a world guided by the principles of peace and mutual respect among nations was possible and that pagan nations had a right to peace and to possession of their own lands. 
After 1424  retired from public life to Kłodawa, where he died in 1435.

[[History of coins]]

CATEGORIES: Coins, History of money

The history of coins extends from ancient times to the present, and is related to economic history, the history of minting technologies, the history shown by the images on coins, and the history of coin collecting. Coins are still widely used for monetary and other purposes.
All western histories of coins begin with their invention at some time slightly before or after 700 BC. in Aegina Island,http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/aegina.html or according to others in Ephesus, Lydia, 650 BC.http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html
Since that time, coins have been the most universal embodiment of money. These first coins were made of electrum, a naturally occurring pale yellow mixture of gold and silver that was further alloyed with silver and copper.
Also, the Persian coins were very famous in the Persian and Sassanids era. Most notably, in Susa and in Ctesiphon.
Some of the most famous and widely collected coins of antiquity are Roman coins and Greek coins.
The Byzantine Empire minted many coins (see Byzantine currency), including very thin gold coins bearing the image of the Christian cross and various Byzantine emperors.
A tomb of the Shang Dynasty dating back to the 11th century BC shows what may be the first cast copper money Tong Bei. Coinage was in widespread use by the Warring States period and the Han Dynasty.
Some of the earliest coins were beaten at the edges to imitate the shape of a cow, in indication of their value. Most coins are circular but some were rectangular. Also a lot of coins, especially in China had a hole through the center so they could be tied on to a string.
Some of the earliest coins to be made purely from silver and gold were the silver Dirham and gold Dinar in the early Islamic Caliphate from the 7th century.
Silver and gold coins are the most common and universally recognized throughout history, even today.  Mints around the world still make millions of gold and silver coins, such as the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf, the American Gold Eagle, and the Australian Nugget.  Copper, nickel, and other metals are also common, but in lower denominations.

As of the 2001 United Kingdom census, it had a population of 55,000.
Evidence of Stone Age, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon activity has been discovered locally. Throughout the Middle Ages, Sale was a rural township, linked ecclesiastically with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey. In this period, its fertile fields and meadows were used for crops and cattle farming. By the 17th century, Sale had developed a thriving cottage industry, manufacturing garthweb, the woven material from which horses' saddle girths were made.
The Bridgewater Canal reached the town in 1765, providing transport for goods and people, stimulating Sale's urbanisation. The arrival of the railway in 1849 triggered Sale's growth as a commuter town for Manchester and beyond, leading to an influx of middle class residents; by the end of the 19th century the town's population had more than tripled. Agriculture subsequently declined as service industries boomed.
Sale's urban growth resulted in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, following the Local Government Act 1929. The increase in population led to the granting of a charter in 1935, giving Sale honorific borough status. Since then, Sale has continued to thrive as a commuter town, supported by its proximity to the M60 motorway and the Manchester Metrolink network. Retail, real estate, and business sectors have developed. Two of the town's main attractions are the Sale Water Park, which contains an artificial lake used for water-sports, and the Waterside Arts Centre. Sale Sharks rugby union club was founded in the town, as was the Sale Harriers athletics club, although both have now relocated elsewhere.

[[Breeding back]]
CATEGORIES: Ecological experiments, Evolutionary biology, Extinction, Breeding

Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles a wildtype ancestor, usually one that is extinct. Breeding back is not to be confused with dedomestication.
It must be kept in mind that a breeding-back breed may be very similar to the extinct wild type in phenotype, ecological niche, and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. It is not truly possible for a breeding back attempt to actually recreate an extinct wild type that is the breeding target, as an extinct wild type cannot be resurrected via selective breeding alone. Furthermore, even the outward authenticity of a bred-back type depends on the quality of the stock used as the foundation of the project. As a result, some breeds, like Heck cattle, are at best a vague look-alike of the extinct wildtype aurochs, according to the literature.Cis van Vuure: Retracing the Aurochs – History, Morphology and Ecology of an extinct wild Ox. 2005.

[[Pound sign]]

CATEGORIES: Currency symbols

The pound sign (£) is the symbol for the pound sterling—the currency of the United Kingdom (UK). The same symbol is (or was) used for similarly named currencies in some other countries and territories, such as the Irish pound, Gibraltar pound, Australian pound, and Italian lira. Several countries, including Lebanon, call their currency "the pound" but do not use the £ symbol.  In Egypt, whose currency is also named the pound, the £ sign is not totally out of use, although it is uncommon, mainly because the symbol is not easily accessible on the US keyboard layouts that are most commonly used there.http://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/EGP
The symbol derives from a capital "L", representing libra, the basic unit of weight in the Roman Empire, which in turn is derived from the Latin name of the same spelling for scales or a balance. The pound became an English unit of weight and was so named because it originally had the value of one tower pound (~350 grams) of fine (pure) silver.
The pound sign is placed before the number (e.g. "£12,000"), and separated from the following digits by no space or only a thin space.
The symbol ‹₤› was called the lira sign in Italy, before the adoption of the euro. It was used as an alternative to the more usual L to show prices in lire.
In American and Canadian English, the term "pound sign" usually refers to the symbol # (see number sign), and the corresponding telephone key is called the "pound key".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/24/magazine/on-language-hit-the-pound-sign.html| title=On Language; Hit the Pound Sign | author=William Safire | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-05-21 | date=1991-03-24[/tpl]

Robert "Bob" Gibson (born November 9, 1935) is a retired American baseball pitcher who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals (1959–1975). Nicknamed "Gibby" and "Hoot", Gibson tallied 251 wins, 3,117 strikeouts, and a 2.91 earned run average (ERA) during his career. A nine-time All-Star and two-time World Series champion, he won two Cy Young Awards and the 1968 National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award.  In 1981, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.  The Cardinals retired his uniform number 45 that same year and inducted him into the team Hall of Fame in 2014.
Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Gibson overcame childhood illness to excel in youth sports, particularly basketball and baseball. After briefly playing under contract to both the basketball Harlem Globetrotters team and the St. Louis Cardinals organization, Gibson decided to only continue playing baseball professionally. Once becoming a full-time starting pitcher in July 1961, Gibson began experiencing an increasing level of success, earning his first All-Star appearance in 1962. Gibson won two of three games he pitched in the 1964 World Series, then won 20 games in season for the first time in 1965. Gibson also pitched three complete game victories in the 1967 World Series. 
The pinnacle of Gibson's career was 1968, when he posted a 1.12 ERA for the season, then followed that by recording 17 strikeouts during Game 1 of the 1968 World Series. Over the course of his career, Gibson became known for his fierce competitive nature and the intimidation factor he used against opposing batters. Gibson threw a no-hitter during the 1971 season, but began experiencing swelling in his knee in subsequent seasons. After retiring as a player in 1975, Gibson later served as pitching coach for his former teammate Joe Torre. At one time a special instructor coach for the St. Louis Cardinals, Gibson was later selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.

CATEGORIES: 1897 births, 1977 deaths, Catalan scientists, Catalan physicians

Josep Trueta i Raspall (1897–1977) was a Catalan medical doctor.
As a Catalan nationalist, he was forced into exile to England after the Spanish Civil War, during which he had been the chief of trauma services for the city of Barcelona. During World War II, he helped to organize medical emergency services there. His use of a new plaster cast method for the treatment of open wounds and fractures helped save a great number of lives during several wars.
Trueta formed part of a group of Catalans exiled in the United Kingdom who denounced the situation of Catalonia under Franco's regime. He wrote The Spirit of Catalonia, a book aimed at explaining Catalan history to English-speaking society.
He joined the team run by Florey and Chain that developed penicillin in Oxford, and held the first live animal to be injected with the revolutionary antibiotic.
He was Professor of Orthopaedics at the University of Oxford and directed the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre (previously the Wingfield-Morris Hospital). He retired in 1966, and returned to Catalonia.
The main hospital of Girona was named in his honour, as are streets in many towns across Catalonia..

With their success, she was given her own imprint, called Del Rey Books. She also edited an original science fiction anthology series, Stellar.  As an editor, she was known for her rapport with authors and she had a beloved reputation. (Philip K.

She suffered a brain hemorrhage in October 1985 and died several months later.  In 1986, she was posthumously awarded the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor, but Lester del Rey declined the award in her name, saying that she would have objected to the award being given to her just because she had recently died.

[tpl]nihongo|Takako Doi|土井 たか子|Doi Takako|extra=born November 30, 1928[/tpl] was a prominent Japanese politician from 1980 until her retirement in 2005.
Doi was born in Hyōgo Prefecture and graduated from Doshisha University, where she studied law. She was elected to the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Diet, as a member of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) in 1969, representing the 2nd district of Hyōgo. She spent her first ten years in the House on the sidelines, but came to national attention in 1980 when she was highly critical of Japan's unequal treatment of women, specifically about women-only home economics degrees and the father-dominated family registration law. She pressured the Diet to sign the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1985.
Doi became Vice Chair of the JSP in 1984 and the first female leader of a political party division in Japanese history in 1986, as chair of the JSP Central Policy Division.  The JSP took a record high number of seats in 1990, when it won 136 seats in the House of Representatives, partly because of Doi's popularity, but she resigned her party post in 1991, in the wake of the Gulf War.
In 1994, no party held a majority in the House and the JSP took the lead in forming a coalition government. The JSP's president, Tomiichi Murayama, became Prime Minister. However, the coalition collapsed in 1996 and, following a disastrous electoral defeat for the JSP later that year, Doi returned to lead the party.

CATEGORIES: International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Crimes against humanity, Crime of aggression, War rape in World War II

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo Trials, the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, or simply the Tribunal, was convened on April 29, 1946, to try the leaders of the Empire of Japan for three types of war crimes. "Class A" crimes were reserved for those who participated in a joint conspiracy to start and wage war, and were brought against those in the highest decision-making bodies; "Class B" crimes were reserved for those who committed "conventional" atrocities or crimes against humanity; "Class C" crimes were reserved for those in "the planning, ordering, authorization, or failure to prevent such transgressions at higher levels in the command structure".[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Twenty-eight Japanese military and political leaders were charged with Class A crimes, and more than 5,700 Japanese nationals were charged with Class B and C crimes, mostly entailing prisoner abuse. China held 13 tribunals of its own, resulting in 504 convictions and 149 executions.
The Japanese Emperor Hirohito and all members of the imperial family, such as career officer Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, were not prosecuted for involvement in any of the three categories of crimes. Herbert Bix explained, "the Truman administration and General MacArthur both believed the occupation reforms would be implemented smoothly if they used Hirohito to legitimise their changes".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.harpercollins.com/author/authorExtra.aspx?authorID=13941&isbn13=9780060931308&displayType=bookinterview |title=Herbert P.

[[Last Amendment]]

CATEGORIES: Crass, Free improvisation ensembles, British jazz ensembles

Last Amendment (formerly known as The Crass Collective and Crass Agenda) is the working title of a series of collaborations by ex-members of the anarchist punk band Crass and others. Although Crass formally split up in 1984, Penny Rimbaud, Gee Vaucher, Eve Libertine, Steve Ignorant, Andy Palmer and Pete Wright came together in November 2002 to put on a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's South Bank in opposition to the at that time proposed War on Iraq. Although they did not all appear on the stage at the same time, most of the ex-members of Crass participated in the event under the name of The Crass Collective, along with other performers such as Ian MacKaye, Goldblade, the English Chamber Choir, Fun Da Mental, Nabil Shaban, etc.
The Crass Collective continued to put on gigs and performances, usually of a collaborative nature, on a regular basis throughout 2003 at the Vortex Club in Stoke Newington, London. In October of that year however they changed the name of the project to Crass Agenda. Works by the collective have included Dada cabaret, an interpretation of Allen Ginsberg's poem Howl, Crass' Yes Sir I Will and an update of Dylan Thomas' play Under Milk Wood, in which property developers move into the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub.
Others that have worked as part of Crass Collective/Crass Agenda include disability rights advocate and actor Nabil Shaban, violinist and pianist Dylan Bates, saxophone player Ingrid Laubrock, John Sharian, Julian Siegel, Gene Calderazzo, Kate Shortt, guitarist and bass player Jennifer Maidman, Ed Jones, A-Soma  and others. During 2004 Crass Agenda were at the forefront of a campaign against the closure of the Vortex jazz club, which has now relocated to Hackney.
In June 2005 the project was renamed Last Amendment, with their website,Southern.com  declaring the name Crass Agenda as being "no more". Their first live performance using this incarnation was on 30 June at the New Vortex club in Hackney, east London.

[[Origin of the Romanians]]

CATEGORIES: Romanian language, History of Romania, Origin hypotheses of ethnic groups

The origin of the Romanians has been for centuries subject to scholarly debate, often driven by political bias. Two basic theories can be differentiated; one theory posits  Daco-Romanian continuity and the other is an immigrationist theory, but interim views also exist. Scholars of the first school argue that the Romanians are mainly descended from the Daco-Romans, a people emerging through the cohabitation of the native Dacians and the Latin-speaking Roman colonists in the Roman province of Dacia north of the river Danube. Accordingly, they suggest that a significant part of the territory of modern Romania has continuously been inhabited by the Romanians' ancestors. Followers of the opposite view argue that the Romanians' ethnogenesis commenced in Moesia and other provinces south of the Danube. Consequently, they propose a northward migration of the Romanians across the river.

The system of academic degrees in the University of Oxford can be confusing to those not familiar with it. This is not merely because many degree titles date from the Middle Ages, but also because many changes have been haphazardly introduced in recent years. For example, the (medieval) BD, BM, BCL, etc., are postgraduate degrees, while the (modern) MPhys, MEng, etc., are undergraduate degrees.
In postnominals, "University of Oxford" is normally abbreviated "Oxon.", which is short for (Academia) Oxoniensis: e.g. MA (Oxon.), although within the university itself the abbreviation "Oxf" can be used.Oxford University Calendar: Notes on Style (12 March 2010)

[[Say's law]]

Say's law, or the law of market, is an economic principle of classical economics named after the French businessman and economist Jean-Baptiste Say (1767–1832), who stated that "products are paid for with products"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/profiles/say.htm?page=153|title=Jean-Baptiste Say |publisher=newschool.edu |first=Jon-Baptiste |last=Say |accessdate=2010-12-20[/tpl] and "a glut can take place only when there are too many means of production applied to one kind of product and not enough to another".[tpl]rp|178–9[/tpl]  In Say's view, a rational businessman will never hoard money; he will promptly spend any money he gets "for the value of money is also perishable."[tpl]rp|138–9[/tpl]
Say's law was generally accepted throughout the 19th century, though modified to incorporate the idea of a "boom and bust" cycle.  During the worldwide Great Depression, in the first half of the 20th century, a school of economics called Keynesian economics arose, disputing Say's conclusions. The debate between classical economics and Keynesian economics continues today.John Kenneth Galbraith, Economics in Perspective, pp. 74–77, Houghton Mifflin, 1987, ISBN 0-395-48346-8
Say was not the discoverer of "Say's law", but the name appears to have stuck to the popularizer of this economic theory, which was in circulation at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.Braudel, The Wheels of Commerce: Civilisation and Capitalism 15th–18th Century, 1979:182.

Tanneguy Le Fèvre (Tanaquillus Faber) (1615 – 12 September 1672) was a French classical scholar.
He was born at Caen. After completing his studies in Paris, he was appointed by Cardinal Richelieu inspector of the printing-press at the Louvre. After Richelieu's death he left Paris, joined the Reformed Church, and in 1651 obtained a professorship at the Academy of Saumur, which he filled with great success for nearly twenty years. His increasing ill-health and a certain moral laxity (as shown in his judgment on Sappho) led to a quarrel with the consistory, as a result of which he resigned his professorship. Several universities were eager to obtain his services, and he had accepted a post offered him by the elector palatine at Heidelberg, when he died suddenly. One of his children, Anne, became famous as Madame Dacier.
Lefebvre was a highly cultivated man and a thorough classical scholar. He brought out editions of various Greek and Latin authors: Longinus, Anacreon and Sappho, Virgil, Horace, Lucretius and many others.
His most important original works are: Les Vies des poètes Grecs (1665); Méthode pour commencer les humanités Grecques et latines (2nd ed., 1731), of which several English adaptations have appeared; and Epistolae Criticae (1659).

[[Anne Dacier]]
CATEGORIES: French classical scholars, French translators, Writers from Paris, People from Saumur, Converts to Roman Catholicism from Calvinism, French Roman Catholics, French women writers, 1654 births, 1720 deaths

Anne Le Fèvre Dacier (1654 – 17 August 1720), better known during her lifetime as Madame Dacier, was a French scholar and translator of the classics.
She was born at Saumur and was raised there. Her father, Tanneguy Le Fèvre, died in 1672 and she moved to Paris, carrying with her part of an edition of Callimachus, which she afterwards published. This was so well received that she was engaged as one of the editors of the Delphin series of classical authors, in which she edited Publius Annius Florus, Dictys Cretensis, Sextus Aurelius Victor and Eutropius. Through her father she met her husband André Dacier, who was his pupil.
In 1681 appeared her prose version of Anacreon and Sappho, and in the next few years, she published prose versions of Terence and some of the plays of Plautus and Aristophanes. In 1684 she and her husband retired to Castres, with the object of devoting themselves to theological studies. In 1685 the Daciers were rewarded with a pension by Louis XIV of France for their conversion to Roman Catholicism .
In 1699 appeared the prose translation of the Iliad (followed nine years later by a similar translation of the
Odyssey), which earned her the esteem in which she is held in French literature. This version, which made Homer known for the first time to many French men of letters (including  Antoine Houdar de la Motte) gave rise to a famous literary controversy. In 1714, La Motte published a poetical version of the Iliad, abridged and altered to suit his own taste, together with a Discours sur Homère, stating the reasons why Homer failed to satisfy his critical taste. Mme. Dacier replied in the same year in her work, Des causes de la corruption du goût.
La Motte carried on the discussion with light gaiety and badinage, and had the happiness of seeing his views supported by the abbé Jean Terrasson, who in 1715 produced two volumes entitled Dissertation critique sur L'Iliade, in which he maintained that science and philosophy, and especially the science and philosophy of René Descartes, had so developed the human mind that the poets of the eighteenth century were immeasurably superior to those of ancient Greece.
In the same year, Claude Buffier published Homère en arbitrage, in which he concluded that both parties were really agreed on the essential point that Homer was one of the greatest geniuses the world had seen, and that, as a whole, no other poem could be preferred to his; and, soon after (on 5 April 1716) in the house of Jean-Baptiste de Valincourt, Mme. Dacier and La Motte met at supper, and drank to the health of Homer. Nothing of importance marks the rest of Mme. Dacier's life. She died at the Louvre in 1720, aged 66.

[[Dictys Cretensis]]

CATEGORIES: Cretan mythology, Trojan War literature

Dictys Cretensis ([tpl]lang-grc|Δίκτυς ὁ Κρής[/tpl]) of Knossus was the legendary companion of Idomeneus during the Trojan War, and the purported author of a diary of its events, that deployed some of the same materials worked up by Homer for the Iliad. With the rise in credulity in Late Antiquity[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl], the story of his journal, an amusing fiction addressed to a knowledgeable and sophisticated Alexandrian audience, came to be taken literally.
In the 4th century AD a certain Q. Septimius brought out Dictys Cretensis Ephemeridos belli Trojani, ("Dictys of Crete, chronicle of the Trojan War") in six books, a work that professed to be a Latin translation of the Greek version. Its chief interest lies in the fact that, as knowledge of Greek waned and disappeared in Western Europe, this and the De excidio Trojae of Dares Phrygius were the sources from which the Homeric legends were transmitted to the Romance literature of the Middle Ages.
An elaborate frame story presented in the prologue to the Latin text details how the manuscript of this work, written in Phoenician characters on tablets of limewood or tree bark, survived: it was said to have been enclosed in a leaden box and buried with its author, according to his wishes.
The Greek "name" Eupraxis simply means "right actions", a familiar goal in discussions of ethics, and an amusingly apt name for the finder.
The prologue that characterizes one manuscript tradition is substituted in the other main group of manuscripts with a letter as if written by a Q. Septimius Romanus, to a Q. Arcadius Rufus, in which the writer, giving a condensed version of the discovery tale, informs his friend that, the volume having fallen into his hands, he had been induced, for his own amusement and the instruction of others, to convert it into Latin. The modern editor, Werner Eisenhut,Werner Eisenhut, editor, Ephemeridos belli Troiani libri (Leipzig: Teubner) 1958. surmises that the two groups, neither of which is to be consistently preferred to the other, represent two published editions in Late Antiquity. There are retranslations into Greek of Byzantine date, embodied in universal histories, of which Smith adds, "We may add to this account, that the writers of the Byzantine period, such as Joannes Malelas, Constantinus Porphyrogenitus, Georgius Cedrenus, Constantinus Manasses, Joannes and Isaacus Tzetzes, with others, quote largely from this Dictys as an author of the highest and most unquestionable authority, and he certainly was known as early as the age of Aelian."
Petrarch's own copy of Ephemeridos belli Troiani, his key to Homer, is now the Codex Parisinus Lat. 5690, in the Bibliothèque National. The first printed edition was early, not after 1471.Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke, no. 8324.
Modern scholars were in disagreement as to whether any Greek original really existed; but all doubt on the point was removed by the discovery of a fragment in Greek amongst the Oxyrhyncus papyri found by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt in 1899–1900.The papyrus was reused for revenue returns in 206 CE. Nathaniel E. Griffin, "The Greek Dictys" The American Journal of Philology 29.3 (1908), pp. 329-335. It revealed that the Latin was a close translation. The other surprise was the discovery, in the library of conte Aurelio Guglielmo Balleani at Jesi,The manuscript in Balleani's library, called the Codex Aesinus also contained the Germania of Tacitus and the Agricola (C. E. Murgia and R. H. Rodgers, "A Tale of two manuscripts", Classical Philology 1984, pp 145ff. of a manuscript of Dictys, in large part of the ninth century, that was described and collated by C. Annibaldi in 1907.

CATEGORIES: 1672 births, 1731 deaths, People from Paris, Members of the Académie française

Antoine Houdar de la Motte (18 January 1672 – 26 December 1731) was a French author.
De la Motte was born and died in Paris. In 1693 his comedy, Les Originaux (Les originaux, ou, l'Italien), was a complete failure, and so depressed the author that he contemplated joining the Trappists. Four years later he began writing texts for operas and ballets, e.g. L'Europe galante (1697), and tragedies, one of which, Inès de Castro (1723), was an immense success at the Theâtre Français. He was a champion of the moderns in the revived controversy of the ancients and moderns. Anne Dacier had published (1699) a translation of the Iliad, and La Motte, who knew no Greek, made a translation (1714) in verse founded on her work.
He said of his own work: "I have taken the liberty to change what I thought disagreeable in it." He defended the moderns in the Discours sur Homère prefixed to his translation, and in his Réflexions sur la critique (1716). Apart from the merits of the controversy, it was conducted on La Motte's side with a wit and politeness which compared very favourably with his opponents' methods. He was elected to the Académie française in 1710, but soon afterwards went blind. La Motte carried on a correspondence with the duchesse du Maine, and was the friend of Fontenelle. He had the same freedom from prejudice and the same inquiring mind as the latter, and it is on the excellent prose in which his views are expressed that his reputation rests.
His Œuvres du theâtre (2 vols.) appeared in 1730, and his Œuvres (10 vols.) in 1754. See Hippolyte Rigault, Histoire de la querelle des anciens et des modernes (1859).

The pyrethrins are a pair of natural organic compounds normally derived from Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium that have potent insecticidal activity.  Pyrethrins are neurotoxins that attack the nervous systems of all insects. When present in amounts not fatal to insects, they still appear to have an insect repellent effect. Pyrethrins are gradually replacing organophosphates and organochlorides as the pesticide of first choice. They are non-persistent, being biodegradable, and break down on exposure to light or oxygen. The chemical structure of pyrethrins inspired the production of a variety of synthetic insecticides called pyrethroids such as bifenthrin, permethrin, and cypermethrin.

[[Publius Annius Florus]]
CATEGORIES: Romans from Africa, Roman-era poets, Annii, 2nd-century poets, 2nd-century Romans, Year of birth unknown, Year of death unknown

Publius Annius Florus, Roman poet and rhetorician, identified by some authorities with the historian Florus.
The introduction to a dialogue called Virgilius orator an poeta is extant, in which the author (whose name is given as Publius Annius Florus) states that he was born in Africa, and at an early age took part in the literary contests on the Capitol instituted by Domitian. Having been refused a prize owing to the prejudice against African provincials, he left Rome in disgust, and after travelling for some time set up at Tarraco as a teacher of rhetoric.
Here he was persuaded by an acquaintance to return to Rome, for it is generally agreed that he is the Florus who wrote the well-known lines quoted together with Hadrian's answer by Aelius Spartianus (Hadrian I 6). Twenty-six trochaic tetrameters, De qualitate vitae, and five graceful hexameters, De rosis, are also attributed to him.
Florus is important as being the first in order of a number of 2nd century African writers who exercised a considerable influence on Latin literature, and also the first of the poetae neoterici or novelli (new-fashioned poets) of Hadrian's reign, whose special characteristic was the use of lighter and graceful metres (anapaestic and iambic dimeters), which had hitherto found little favour.
The little poems will be found in E. Bahrens, Poëtae Latini minores (1879–1883); for an unlikely identification of Florus with the author of the Pervigilium Veneris see E. H. O. Müller, De P. Anino Floro poéta et de Pervigilio Veneris (1855), and, for the poet's relations with Hadrian, Franz Eyssenhardt, Hadrian und Florus (1882); see also Friedrich Marx in Pauly-Wissowa's Realencyclopädie, i. pt. 2 (1894).

[[Pervigilium Veneris]]

CATEGORIES: Latin poems, Ancient Roman erotic literature

Pervigilium Veneris, the Vigil of Venus, is a Latin poem of uncertain date, variously assigned to the 2nd, 4th or 5th centuries. It is sometimes thought to have been by the poet Tiberianus, because of strong similarities with his poem Amnis ibat, though other scholars attribute it to Publius Annius Florus, and yet others find no sufficient evidence for any attribution.On the text see John William Mackail in Journal of Philology (1888), Vol. xvii.[tpl]cite book |last1=Korhonen |first1=Kalle |date= |year=2012 |chapter=Sicily in the Roman Imperial period: Language and society |editor1-last=Tribulato |editor1-first=Olga |title=Language and Linguistic Contact in Ancient Sicily |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uGAhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA406&dq=%22tiberianus%22+%22pervigilium+veneris%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s1ljU4XAKYnDPNDHgOAM&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22tiberianus%22%20%22pervigilium%20veneris%22&f=false |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=360 |isbn=9781107029316 |accessdate=2 May 2014 [/tpl] It was written professedly in early spring on the eve of a three-night festival of Venus (probably April 1–3) in a setting that seems to be Sicily. The poem describes the annual awakening of the vegetable and animal world through the "benign post-Lucretian" goddess,"la benigna dea post-Lucreziana" (i.e., the Venus genetrix derived from Lucretius's De Rerum Natura), see Andrea Cucchiarelli, La Veglia di Venere: Pervigilium Veneris (Milano: BUR Classici Greci e Latini, Rizzoli: 2003), p. 7. which contrasts with the tragic isolation of the silent "I" of the poet/speaker against the desolate background of a ruined city, a vision that prompts Andrea Cuccchiarelli to note the resemblance of the poem's construction to the cruelty of a dream.Cucchiarelli (2003), p. 7. It is notable because of its focus on the natural world – something never before seen in Roman poetry – which marks the transition from Roman poetry to Medieval poetry. It consists of ninety-three verses in trochaic septenarius, and is divided into strophes of unequal length by the refrain:

''Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet.
Let him love tomorrow who has never loved, and let him who has loved love tomorrow.

The poem ends with the nightingale’s song, and a poignant expression of personal sorrow:

illa cantat; nos tacemus; quando ver venit meum?
She sings; I am silent; when will my springtime come?

Lucius Annaeus Florus (c. 74 AD – c. 130 ADSaecula Latina (1962), p. 215) was a Roman historian who lived in the time of Trajan and Hadrian. He was born in Africa.
He compiled, chiefly from Livy, a brief sketch of the history of Rome from the foundation of the city to the closing of the temple of Janus by Augustus (25 BC). The work, which is called Epitome de T. Livio Bellorum omnium annorum DCC Libri duo, is written in a bombastic and rhetorical style – a panegyric of the greatness of Rome, the life of which is divided into the periods of infancy, youth and manhood. It is often wrong in geographical and chronological details. In spite of its faults, the book was much used as a handy epitome of Roman history, in the Middle Ages, and survived as a textbook into the nineteenth century.
In the manuscripts, the writer is variously named as Julius Florus, Lucius Anneus Florus, or simply Annaeus Florus. From certain similarities of style, he has been identified as Publius Annius Florus, poet, rhetorician and friend of Hadrian, author of a dialogue on the question of whether Virgil was an orator or poet, of which the introduction has been preserved.
The most accessible modern text and translation are in the Loeb Classical Library (no. 231, published 1984, ISBN 0-674-99254-7).
Christopher Plantin, Antwerp, in 1567, published two Lucius Florus texts (two title pages) in one volume. The titles were roughly as follows: 1) L.IVLII Flori de Gestis Romanorum, Historiarum; 2) Commentarius I STADII L.IVLII Flori de Gestis Romanorum, Historiarum. The first title has 149 pages; the second has 222 pages plus an index in a 12mo-size book.

[[Demetrius the Cynic]]
CATEGORIES: 1st-century Greek people, 1st-century philosophers, Roman-era Corinthians, Roman-era Cynic philosophers, Roman-era philosophers in Rome

Demetrius ([tpl]lang-el|Δημήτριος[/tpl]; 1st century), a Cynic philosopher from Corinth, who lived in Rome during the reigns of Caligula, Nero and Vespasian (37-71 AD).
He was the intimate friend of Seneca, who wrote about him often,Seneca, Epistles, [tpl]ws|20.9[/tpl], [tpl]ws|62.3[/tpl], [tpl]ws|67.14[/tpl], [tpl]ws|91.19[/tpl]; De Beneficiis, vii. 1-2, 8-11; De Providentia; De Vita Beata and who describes him as the perfect man:
 
 Demetrius, who seems to have been placed by nature in our times that he might prove that we could neither corrupt him nor be corrected by him; a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself disclaimed it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects, scorning mere prettinesses and verbal niceties, but expressing with infinite spirit, the ideas which inspired it. I doubt not that he was endowed by divine providence with so pure a life and such power of speech in order that our age might neither be without a model nor a reproach.Seneca, De Beneficiis (On Benefits), vii. 8
His contempt for worldly riches is shown by his reply to Caligula who, wishing to corrupt him, offered him two hundred thousand sesterces. Demetrius replied, "If he meant to tempt me, he ought to have tried to do so by offering his entire kingdom."Seneca, De Beneficiis (On Benefits), vii. 11
He was also a friend of Thrasea Paetus and was with him when Thrasea was condemned to death (66 AD).Tacitus, Annals, 16. 34  We hear of him again in the reign of Vespasian (c. 70 AD), when, curiously, he defended Publius Egnatius Celer against the charges brought against him by Musonius Rufus.Tacitus, History, 4.40  He was exiled from Rome in 71 AD, by Vespasian, along with all other philosophers.Cassius Dio, Roman History, Epitome of Book 65
Demetrius is sometimes identified with the Demetrius of Sunium mentioned by Lucian.Lucian, Toxaris.  However, Demetrius was a very common name in the Roman world, and Demetrius of Sunium was probably, (but not certainly), a different, later Cynic.

[[Demetrius of Alopece]]
CATEGORIES: 4th-century BC Greek sculptors, Ancient Greek sculptors, Ancient Athenian sculptors

Demetrius of AlopeceAlopece (Ἀλωπεκή) was a deme of Classical Athens. ([tpl]lang-el|Δημήτριος[/tpl]), was a Greek sculptor of the early part of the 4th century BC, who is said by ancient critics to have been notable for the lifelike realism of his statues.
His portrait of Pellichus, a Corinthian general, with fat paunch and bald head, wearing a cloak which leaves him half exposed, with some of the hairs of his head flowing in the wind, and prominent veins, was admired by Lucian. He was contrasted with Cresilas, an idealizing sculptor of the generation before.
Since however the peculiarities mentioned by Lucian do not appear in Greek portraits before the 3rd century BC and since the Greek art of the 4th century consistently idealizes, there would seem to be a difficulty to explain. The date of Demetrius above given is confirmed by inscriptions found on the Athenian Acropolis.

[[Feri Tradition]]
CATEGORIES: Neopagan traditions, Neopaganism

The Feri Tradition (which is a different tradition than Faery, Fairy, Faerie, or Vicia,) is an initiatory tradition of non-Wiccan witchcraft. It is an ecstatic (rather than fertility) tradition stemming from the experience of Cora and Victor Anderson . Strong emphasis is placed on sensual experience and awareness, including sexual mysticism, which is not limited to heterosexual expression."The Faery Tradition" ©1988, 1995, 2000 Anna Korn The Feri Tradition has very diverse influences, such as Huna, Vodou, Faery lore, Kabbalah, Hoodoo, Tantra, and Gnosticism. 
Among the distinguishing features of the Feri tradition is the use of a specific Feri power or energetic current. Feri witches often see themselves as "fey": outside social definitions and intentionally living within paradox. They believe that much of reality is unseen, or at least has uncertain boundaries. Within the tradition there is a deep respect for the wisdom of nature, a love of beauty, and an appreciation of bardic and mantic creativity.
Core teachings acknowledged by most branches of the tradition include the concepts of the Three Souls and the Black Heart of Innocence, the tools of the Iron and Pearl Pentacle (now commonly also used by Reclaiming (Neopaganism)), as well as an awareness of "energy ecology", which admonishes practitioners to never give away or waste their personal power. Trance experiences and personal connection to the Divine are at the heart of this path, leading to a wide variety of practices throughout the larger body of the tradition.
Feri is not a tradition of Wicca; there are Wiccan groups and traditions sometimes calling themselves "Fairy" (Faerie, Faery, etc.), but these are distinct from the Feri Tradition.Is Feri a Wiccan tradition?http://www.feritradition.org/FAQ.htm#noconnection

[[Sicilian Expedition]]

The Sicilian Expedition was an Athenian military expedition to Sicily, which took place during the period from 415 BC to 413 BC (during the Peloponnesian War). The expedition was hampered from the outset by uncertainty in its purpose and command structure—political maneuvering in Athens swelled a lightweight force of twenty ships into a massive armada, and the expedition's primary proponent, Alcibiades, was recalled from command to stand trial before the fleet even reached Sicily—but still achieved early successes. Syracuse, the most powerful state on Sicily, responded exceptionally slowly to the Athenian threat and, as a result, was almost completely invested before the arrival of a Spartan general, Gylippus, galvanized its inhabitants into action. From that point forward, however, as the Athenians ceded the initiative to their newly energized opponents, the tide of the conflict shifted. A massive reinforcing armada from Athens briefly gave the Athenians the upper hand once more, but a disastrous failed assault on a strategic high point and several crippling naval defeats damaged the besiegers' fighting capacity and morale, and the Athenians were eventually forced to attempt a desperate overland escape from the city they had hoped to conquer. That last measure, too, failed, and nearly the entire expedition surrendered or was destroyed in the Sicilian interior.
The impact of the defeat was immense. Two hundred ships and thousands of soldiers, an appreciable portion of the city's total manpower, were lost in a single stroke. Athens' enemies on the mainland and in Persia were encouraged to take action, and rebellions broke out in the Aegean. The defeat proved to be the crucial turning point in the Peloponnesian War, though Athens struggled on for another decade. Thucydides observed that contemporary Greeks were shocked not that Athens eventually fell after the defeat, but rather that it fought on for as long as it did, so devastating were the losses suffered.

The City of London Corporation, officially and legally the Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London, is the municipal governing body of the City of London, the historic centre of London and the location of much of the UK's financial sector. Until 2006, when the name was changed to avoid confusion with the wider London local government authority, the Greater London Authority, it was informally known as the Corporation of London.The body was popularly known as the Corporation of London but on 10 November 2005 the Corporation announced that its informal title would from 3 January 2006 be the City of London (or the City of London Corporation where the corporate body needed to be distinguished from the geographical area). This may reduce confusion between the Corporation and the Greater London Authority.
The corporation claims to be the world's oldest continuously elected local government body. Both businesses and residents of the City, or "Square Mile", are entitled to vote in elections, and in addition to its functions as the local authority – analogous to those undertaken by the boroughs that administer the rest of London – it takes responsibility for supporting the financial services industry and representing its interests.[tpl]cite web|title=History and Heritage|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/history-and-future/history-and-heritage/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=City of London website|accessdate=13 January 2013[/tpl]  The corporation's structure includes the Lord Mayor, the Court of Aldermen, the Court of Common Council and the Freemen and Livery of the City.

[[MIM-14 Nike Hercules]]
CATEGORIES: Project Nike, Nuclear anti-aircraft weapons, Nuclear missiles of the Cold War, Cold War surface-to-air missiles of the United States

The Nike Hercules (initially designated SAM-A-25, and later MIM-14), was a solid fuel propelled two-stage surface-to-air missile, used by U.S. and NATO armed forces for medium- and high-altitude long-range air defense. It was normally armed with the W31 nuclear warhead, but could also be fitted with a conventional warhead for export use. Its warhead also allowed it to be used in a surface-to-surface role, and the system also demonstrated its ability to hit other short-range missiles in flight. Hercules was replaced in the long-range anti-aircraft role by the higher performance and considerably more mobile MIM-104 Patriot.
Hercules was developed as the successor to the earlier MIM-3 Nike Ajax, adding the ability to attack high-flying supersonic targets and carrying a small nuclear warhead in order to attack entire formations of aircraft with a single missile. Development went smoothly, and deployment began in 1958 at new bases, but eventually took over many existing Ajax bases as well, reaching a peak of over 130 bases in the US alone. Throughout, Hercules was the subject of a lengthy and acrimonious debate due to complaints from supporters of the US Air Force's competing CIM-10 Bomarc system, which ultimately proved unsuccessful and saw limited deployment. US Hercules sites began wide-scale deactivation during the 1970s as the threat of Soviet bombers subsided with the growth of ICBM forces, but remained a front-line weapon in Europe, with the last units deactivated in 1988.
Several modifications of the Hercules system were considered but not put into production. Extensive studies into a mobile version were carried out, but never deployed in favour of other designs. The vacuum tube-based electronics, inherited from the early-1950s Ajax, were examined for potential solid state upgrades, but not deployed. Study into an upgraded version of the Hercules for the anti-ballistic missile role was carried out, but this later evolved into the considerably different LIM-49 Nike Zeus design. Hercules would prove to be the last development of Bell's Nike team; Zeus was never deployed and its follow-ons were developed by different teams.

[[Water gun]]
CATEGORIES: Toy weapons, Water toys, Water guns, Harassment devices

A water gun (or water pistol, squirt gun, or water blaster) is a type of toy gun designed to shoot water. Similar to water balloons, the primary purpose of the toy is to soak another person in a game such as water warfare.
Historically, water guns were made of metal and used rubber squeeze bulbs to load and propel water through a nozzle[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.isoaker.com/Info/Misc/factoids_oldest.html |title=Oldest Known Water Guns |publisher=iSoaker.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20[/tpl]
Traditionally, water guns have worked on the same principle as a spray bottle. The body is essentially a container for water and the trigger is attached to a pump which squirts water out of a tiny hole at the muzzle or nozzle.  However, many modern water guns employ more complex technologies to provide more power and water output than their predecessors. Modern variations may employ compressed air, rubber chambers, springs, peristaltic pumps, or hydraulic pressure to propel the water. Some even use an electric pump powered by batteries. Some employ a combination of technologies to produce better stream performance. A common term for large high pressure water guns is "water blasters".
For several years in the U.S. and Canada, import regulations and domestic laws have required squirt guns to be made of clear or tinted transparent plastic to make them harder to mistake for actual firearms.

[[Trace fossil]]

Trace fossils, also called ichnofossils (sg. [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|k|n|oʊ|f|ɒ|s|ɨ|l[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|ιχνος[/tpl] ikhnos "trace, track"), are geological records of biological activity.  Trace fossils may be impressions made on the substrate by an organism: for example, burrows, borings (bioerosion), urolites (erosion caused by evacuation of liquid wastes), footprints and feeding marks, and root cavities. The term in its broadest sense also includes the remains of other organic material produced by an organism — for example coprolites (fossilized droppings) or chemical markers — or sedimentological structures produced by biological means - for example, stromatolites. Trace fossils contrast with body fossils, which are the fossilized remains of parts of organisms' bodies, usually altered by later chemical activity or mineralization.
Sedimentary structures, for example those produced by empty shells rolling along the sea floor, are not produced through the behaviour of an organism and not considered trace fossils.
The study of traces is called ichnology, which is divided into paleoichnology, or the study of trace fossils, and neoichnology, the study of modern traces. This science is challenging, as most traces reflect the behaviour — not the biological affinity — of their makers.   As such, trace fossils are categorised into form genera, based upon their appearance and the implied behaviour of their makers.

[[Pseudofossil]]

CATEGORIES: Paleontology, Geology, Fossils

Pseudofossils are inorganic objects, markings, or impressions that might be mistaken for fossils. Pseudofossils may be misleading, as some types of mineral deposits can mimic lifeforms by forming what appear to be highly detailed or organized structures. One common example is when manganese oxides crystallize with a characteristic treelike or dendritic pattern along a rock fracture. The formation of frost dendrites on a window is another common example of this crystal growth. Concretions are sometimes thought to be fossils, and occasionally one contains a fossil, but are generally not fossils themselves. Chert or flint nodules in limestone can often take forms that resemble fossils.
Pyrite disks or spindles are sometimes mistaken for fossils of sand dollars or other forms (see marcasite). Cracks, bumps, gas bubbles, and such can be difficult to distinguish from true fossils. Specimens which cannot be attributed with certainty to either the fossils or the pseudofossils are treated as dubiofossils. Debates about whether specific forms are pseudo or true fossils can be lengthy and difficult. For example, Eozoön is a complex laminated form of interlayered calcite and serpentine originally found in Precambrian metamorphosed limestones (marbles). It was at first thought to be the remains of a giant fossil protozoan (Dawson, 1865), then being by far the oldest fossil known. Similar structures were subsequently found in metamorphosed limestone blocks ejected during an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. It was clear that high-temperature physical and chemical processes were responsible for the formation of Eozoön in the carbonate rock (O'Brien, 1970). The debate over the interpretation of Eozoon was a significant episode in the history of paleontology (Adelman, 2007).

[[Concretion]]
CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks, Minerals, Petrology, Mineralogy

A concretion is a hard, compact mass of sedimentary rock formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between the sediment grains. Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape, although irregular shapes also occur. The word 'concretion' is derived from the Latin con meaning 'together' and crescere meaning 'to grow'. Concretions form within layers of sedimentary strata that have already been deposited. They usually form early in the burial history of the sediment, before the rest of the sediment is hardened into rock. This concretionary cement often makes the concretion harder and more resistant to weathering than the host stratum. 
There is an important distinction to draw between concretions and nodules. Concretions are formed from mineral precipitation around some kind of nucleus while a nodule is a replacement body.
Descriptions dating from the 18th century attest to the fact that concretions have long been regarded as geological curiosities. Because of the variety of unusual shapes, sizes and compositions, concretions have been interpreted to be dinosaur eggs, animal and plant fossils (called pseudofossils), extraterrestrial debris or human artifacts.

Simone Melchior Cousteau (19 January 1919 – 1 December 1990) was the wife and business partner of undersea explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. The first woman scuba diver and aquanaut, Simone was at Jacques's side during his major underwater accomplishments. She led him to the men and money who would build his scuba invention, she helped buy their beloved Calypso, saved the ship during a storm, and made sure each exploration achieved its objective. 
Although never visible in the Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau series, Simone played a key role in the operation at sea. Acting as mother, healer, nurse and psychiatrist to the all-male crew for 40 years, her nickname was "La Bergere," the Shepherdess.

Prey is a novel by Michael Crichton, first published in November 2002. An excerpt was published in the January–February 2003 issue of Seed. Like Jurassic Park, the novel serves as a cautionary tale about developments in science and technology; in this case, nanotechnology, genetic engineering and artificial intelligence.
The book features relatively new advances in the computing/scientific community, such as artificial life, emergence (and by extension, complexity), genetic algorithms, and agent-based computing.
While the novel has yet to be adapted into a movie, film rights to the novel were purchased by 20th Century Fox.[tpl]cite web|last=Boehm|first=Erich|url=http://variety.com/1997/film/news/20th-hunts-crichton-s-prey-1117341571|publisher=Variety|title=20th hunts Crichton’s ‘Prey’[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Napalm Death albums, 1987 debut albums, Earache Records albums

Scum is the first album by English grindcore band Napalm Death. It was released on 1 July 1987 through Earache Records.
Side A of Scum was originally recorded for £50.00 at Rich Bitch studio (Birmingham, England) in August 1986. It was intended to form part of a split release with English crossover thrash band Atavistic on Manic Ears (Bristol, England). After an extensive line-up change, the second half of Scum was recorded in May 1987 at Rich Bitch studio. The two sides were combined and released as a single album. Only drummer Mick Harris played on both sides of the album.
The first pressing of the CD (1988) came as a 54-track CD, which included the From Enslavement To Obliteration album and four bonus tracks. In 1994, the first two albums were re-released separately. A remastered version was released on 27 January 2012. The album cover was designed by Bill Steer's Carcass bandmate Jeffrey Walker. The album covers came in varied colours: orange, gold, green, blue, and yellow. The song "You Suffer" was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's shortest song; the track is precisely 1.316 seconds long.

Pronounced.|accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl]; from Sami Giebmegáisi or Giebnegáisi, "Cauldron Crest") is the highest mountain in Sweden. The Kebnekaise massif, which is part of the Scandinavian Mountains, has two peaks, of which the southern, glaciated one is highest at [tpl]convert|2,106|m[/tpl] above sea level at the latest time of measurement. The north top ([tpl]convert|2,096|m[/tpl]) is free of ice. Kebnekaise lies in Lapland, about 150 kilometres (ca. 90 miles) north of the Arctic Circle and west of Kiruna near the popular Kungsleden hiking trail between Abisko and Nikkaluokta.
The glacier which covers the southern peak has shrunk, and therefore the summit is not as high as earlier. The top is traditionally said to be [tpl]convert|2,111|m[/tpl], and higher in the oldest measurement, i.e. [tpl]convert|2,117|m[/tpl]. If the melting continues at the same rate, the south peak will sink below the north peak (which is the highest fixed point in Sweden) within a few years' time.Malin Olofsson, "Toppskifte på Kebnekaise", Sveriges Radio, 15 June 2007, retrieved 27 March 2012 [tpl]sv icon[/tpl]Kebnekaises sydtopp – högst i Sverige?, fjallklubben.org (broken link)
A mountain lodge, Kebnekaise mountain lodge (Kebnekaise fjällstation), is located at the foot of Kebnekaise, ca. 19 km, 6–7 hours from Nikkaluokta. It is the starting point for an ascent via the western route (västra leden, ca. 13 km, 4–6 hours to the summit) or the eastern route (östra leden, ca. 10 km, 3–5 hours to the summit). The western route leads over scree slopes and the intermediate peak Vierranvárri to the glaciated summit. Most of this route to the top is pure hiking, but there is a short exposed part that could possibly count as scrambling (YDS grade 2).  The eastern route leads over glaciers and rocks and offers exposure (YDS grade 4). It is however equipped with fixed steel cables for protection, similar to a via ferrata. 
There is also a third, more uncommon route only marked with cairns - "Durlings led", which branches off Kungsleden a few kilometers north of Singi, goes about two kilometers into the southern side of Singivagge, and then turns north into the valley between Kuopertjåkka and Singipakte (peak 1614). Some people, such as those with acrophobia or wanting to summit with heavy backpacks, may see benefits with this route as not a single point on it is exposed. "Durlings led" eventually merges with the western route close to the summit.
About 300 altitude meters below the top, one encounters the peak cabins. After the cabins, the trail continues through a rocky landscape and the slope progressively ceases. The peak glacier is a small top, merely tens of meters high, in a nearly flat landscape as seen from the trail.
To approach the actual mountain top on the peak glacier, crampons or other means of enhancing traction might at times be required. The glacier should be walked upon with great caution; fatal accidents have occurred with people sliding off into the huge void on the eastern side.http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article7275527.ab  This danger might not always be apparent, especially not in times of bad weather and visibility.
Due to the harsh subarctic climate at the location, Kebnekaise sees the vast majority of climbers during the summer months (late June to early September). Even so, early in this season, snow can sometimes make a summit bid tedious. In mainland Europe, there are no higher mountains further north. During clear weather, a vast area can be seen from the summit, according to some sources as much as 10% of Sweden.http://www.swedenoffroad.com/old/sv/reportage/rekordresa.html

A grandson of Irish revolutionary Eoin MacNeill, McDowell was a founding member of the Progressive Democrats political party in the mid-1980s. On three occasions he was elected as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South–East constituency, serving in the 25th Dáil (1987–89), the 27th Dáil (1992–97), and the 29th Dáil (2002–07). He lost his Dáil seat at the general elections of 1989, 1997, and 2007.
During his years in public life, McDowell also served as Attorney General of Ireland (1999–2002), as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (2002–07), as leader of the Progressive Democrats (2006–07), and as Tánaiste (2006–07).
McDowell led the Progressive Democrats to a disastrous performance in the 2007 general election, in which the party lost six of its eight seats in Dáil Éireann, including his own. After conceding his seat to John Gormley at the RDS count centre in Dublin, McDowell abruptly resigned as party leader and announced his immediate retirement from public life. He has since resumed his private legal career.

The Endangered Wolf Center is a non-profit facility in Eureka, Missouri, United States, near St. Louis that is dedicated to preserving and reintroducing to the wild critically endangered species of wolves. It is certified by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The Center was founded in 1971 by renowned naturalist Marlin Perkins and his wife Carol, who saw that wolves around the world were in danger of becoming extinct. Its mission is to preserve and protect Mexican gray wolves, red wolves, and other wild canid species, with purpose and passion, through carefully managed breeding, reintroduction and inspiring education programs. Animals born at the facility have been reintroduced to North Carolina (red wolves) and Arizona and New Mexico (Mexican gray wolves.) The Center’s research focuses on reproductive, behavioral and nutritional needs for the species housed there. The Endangered Wolf Center is a founding member of the AZA’s Mexican Wolf and Red Wolf Species Survival Plans. As of August 2013, the Center had five species of endangered canids: Mexican gray wolves, red wolves, maned wolves, African painted dogs, and swift foxes. It had more than 20 Mexican gray wolves, more than any other managed breeding facility. (Only 75 Mexican gray wolves were known to exist in the wild as of 2012.) The Center serves as the cornerstone of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's program to preserve Mexican gray wolves and reintroduce them to the wild.
The Center offers daytime tours and evening wolf howls. Reservations are required.
The Endangered Wolf Center is an independent 501c(3) non-profit and receives no federal or state support. Its programs are supported solely by members, donors and visitors.
The Center is on the grounds of Washington University’s Tyson Research Center. It is located off Interstate 44, [tpl]convert|7|mi|km[/tpl] west of Interstate 270 and about [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of St. Louis.

[[Teaser campaign]]

CATEGORIES: Film advertising material

A teaser campaign is an advertising campaign which typically consists of a series of small, cryptic, challenging advertisements that anticipate a larger, full-blown campaign for a product launch or otherwise important event. These advertisements are called "teasers" or "teaser ads". A teaser trailer for an upcoming film, television program, video game or similar, is usually released long in advance of the product, so as to "tease" the audience.
An early example of the teaser trailer was the one for the 1978 Superman film by Richard Donner. The film was already nearly a year late; it was designed to re-invigorate interest in the release.

[[Thomas Sutpen]]

CATEGORIES: William Faulkner characters, Fictional characters introduced in 1936

Thomas Sutpen is the focal character of William Faulkner's 1936 novel Absalom, Absalom! Sutpen arrives in Faulkner's imaginary Yoknapatawpha County in Mississippi in the 1830s and established a 100 square mile (260 km²) plantation, Sutpen's Hundred, in an attempt to create his own personal dynasty. It is eventually revealed that Sutpen was born to a poor white family in what becomes West Virginia before moving to the Tidewater region of Virginia where he was first privy to the aristocratic plantation culture of the Antebellum South.
When he was fourteen, he was instructed by a black servant to only use the back door of a plantation when running errands for his father.  This led him to renounce his family and social position. He travelled to the West Indies to build his own plantation and start a lineage, in accordance with his "design". The discovery that his wife was part-black, hence making his son Charles Bon part black, caused him to relocate to Yoknapatawpha County and build a new plantation. The sins of his past and indiscriminate sexual practices eventually caused the downfall of his empire by the early 20th century.
The short story "Wash", which was later incorporated into the seventh chapter of Absalom, Absalom!, focuses on the death of Thomas Sutpen.

[tpl]nihongo|Pom Poko|平成狸合戦ぽんぽこ|Heisei Tanuki Gassen Ponpoko|lit. "Heisei-era Raccoon Dog War Ponpoko"[/tpl] is a 1994 Japanese animated fantasy film, the eighth written and directed by Isao Takahata and animated by Studio Ghibli.
Consistent with Japanese folklore, the tanuki (Japanese raccoon dogs, Nyctereutes procyonoides) are portrayed as a highly sociable, mischievous species, which are able to use "illusion science" to transform into almost anything, but too fun-loving and too fond of tasty treats to be a real threat – unlike the kitsune (foxes) and other shape-shifters. Visually, the tanuki in this film are depicted in three ways at various times: as realistic animals, as anthropomorphic animals which occasionally wear clothes, and as cartoony figures based on the manga of Shigeru Sugiura (of whom Takahata is a great fan). They tend to assume their realistic form when seen by humans, their cartoony form when they are doing something outlandish or whimsical, and their anthropomorphic form at all other times.
Prominent testicles are an integral part of tanuki folklore, and they are shown and referred to throughout the film, and also used frequently in their shape-shifting. This remains unchanged in the DVD release, though the English dub (but not the subtitles) refers to them as "pouches". Also, in the English dub and subtitles, the animals are never referred to as "raccoon dogs", which is the more accurate English name for the tanuki, instead they are incorrectly referred to as just "raccoons".

[[Section (fiber bundle)]]

CATEGORIES: Fiber bundles, Differential topology, Algebraic topology, Homotopy theory

In the mathematical field of topology, a section (or cross section)[tpl]citation|first=Dale|last=Husemöller|title=Fibre Bundles|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1994|isbn=0-387-94087-1|page=12[/tpl] of a fiber bundle π is a continuous right inverse of the function π. In other words, if E is a fiber bundle over a base space, B:
then a section of that fiber bundle is a continuous map,
such that
A section is an abstract characterization of what it means to be a graph. The graph of a function g : B → Y can be identified with a function taking its values in the Cartesian product E = B×Y of B and Y:
Let π : E → X be the projection onto the first factor: π(x,y) = x.  Then a graph is any function s for which π(s(x))=x.
The language of fibre bundles allows this notion of a section to be generalized to the case when E is not necessarily a Cartesian product.  If π : E → B is a fibre bundle, then a section is a choice of point s(x) in each of the fibres.  The condition π(s(x)) = x simply means that the section at a point x must lie over x.  (See image.)
For example, when E is a vector bundle a section of E is an element of the vector space Ex lying over each point x ∈ B. In particular, a vector field on a smooth manifold M is a choice of tangent vector at each point of M: this is a section of the tangent bundle of M. Likewise, a 1-form on M is a section of the cotangent bundle.
Sections, particularly of principal bundles and vector bundles, are also very important tools in differential geometry. In this setting, the base space B is a smooth manifold M, and E is assumed to be a smooth fiber bundle over M (i.e., E is a smooth manifold and π: E → M is a smooth map). In this case, one considers the space of smooth sections of E over an open set U, denoted C∞(U,E). It is also useful in geometric analysis to consider spaces of sections with intermediate regularity (e.g., Ck sections, or sections with regularity in the sense of Hölder conditions or Sobolev spaces).

[[Skyline]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural terminology, City, Landscape art, Skyscrapers

A skyline is  the artificial horizon that a city's overall structure creates.  Skylines serve as a kind of fingerprint of a city, as no two skylines are alike.  For this reason news and sports programs, television shows, and movies often display the skyline of a city to set location.
The Sky Line of New York City was a new term in 1896, when it was the title of a color lithograph by Charles Graham for the color supplement of the New-York Journal.New York Public Library: "Moving Uptown": "When Charles Graham's view of New York was published, the new term used in the title, "sky line," caught on immediately." 
Paul D. Spreiregen, FAIA, has called a skyline "a physical representation a city's facts of life ... a potential work of art ... its collective vista."

The shrine is dedicated to The Black Madonna of Częstochowa and is a replica of the shrine in Częstochowa. The image is referred as the Black Madonna because of its dark brown skin tones.
The shrine has been subjected to arson and vandalism many times in its history such as in 1958 when an arsonist set fire to the altar which burned the chapel.

Ujiji is the place where Richard Burton and John Speke first reached the shore of Lake Tanganyika in 1858. It is also the site of the famous meeting on November 10, 1871 when Henry Stanley found  Dr. David Livingstone, and reputedly uttered the famous words “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” Livingstone, whom many thought dead as no news had been heard of him for several years and who had only arrived back in Ujiji the day before, wrote “When my spirits were at their lowest ebb, the good Samaritan was close at hand, for one morning servant Susi came running at the top of his speed and gasped out, ‘An Englishman! I see him!’ and off he darted to meet him. The American flag at the head of the caravan told of the nationality of the stranger. Bales of goods, baths of tin, huge kettles, cooking pots, tents, etc., made me think, ‘This must be a luxurious traveller, and not one at his wits’ end like me.’”[tpl]Cite book |first=David |last=Livingston |title=The Last Journals of David Livingston |publisher=R.

A monument known as the "Dr. Livingstone Memorial" was erected in Ujiji to commemorate the meeting. There is also a modest museum. There is a former slave route near the market. In 1878, the London Missionary Society established their first missionary post on the shore of Lake Tanganyika at Ujiji.
Some in Burundi claim the location of the famous meeting is a few miles south of the capital Bujumbura. However the Livingstone-Stanley Monument in Mugere actually marks a visit the two men made 15 days later on their joint exploration of northern Lake Tanganyika.

Names in italics indicate that these people rank elsewhere—either higher in that table of precedence or in the table for the other sex. Titles in italics indicate the same thing for their holders, or that they are vacant.
Peers and their families make up a large part of these tables. It is possible for a peer to hold more than one title of nobility, and these may belong to different ranks and peerages. A peer derives his precedence from his highest-ranking title; peeresses derive their precedence in their same way, whether they hold their highest-ranking title in their own right or by marriage. The ranks in the tables refer to peers rather than titles: if exceptions are named for a rank, these do not include peers of a higher rank (or any peers at all, in the case of baronets). No exceptions are named for most categories, due to their large size.

The Treaty of Westminster of 1674 was the peace treaty that ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Signed by the Netherlands and England, it provided for the return of the colony of New Netherland to England and renewed the Treaty of Breda of 1667. It also provided for a mixed commission for the regulation of commerce, particularly in the East Indies.
It was signed on 19 February 1674 (Old Style: 9 February 1674) by Charles II of England and ratified by the States-General of the Netherlands on 5 March 1674. England was forced to sign the treaty as Parliament would not allow more money to be spent on the war and had become aware of the secret Treaty of Dover in which Charles had promised Louis XIV of France to convert to Catholicism at an opportune moment. The English were dismayed by the unexpected fact that Dutch raiders managed to capture more English ships than vice versa and that New Amsterdam had been retaken by the Dutch in 1673.
Most of the initial peace conditions demanded by the English in the Accord of Heeswijk of 1672 were not met, but the Dutch paid two million guilders (down from an original demand of ten million) to be paid over a period of three years (basically to compensate for the loss of French subsidies) and again affirmed the English right of salute, their Dominium Marium from Land's End northward to Staten Land. This was qualified by the condition that Dutch fishery would in no way be impeded by this right. The treaty conditions of 1668, regulating trade and shipping, were reconfirmed. As regards territorial disputes, the treaty was a typical status quo ante arrangement:
Peace was proclaimed at Whitehall on 27 February (New Style) at 10:00 AM. The condition implied that New Netherland, retaken by Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest in 1673, would henceforth again be an English possession and that Suriname, captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, legalising the status quo of 1667. These issues had been left undecided by the Peace of Breda of that year, an uti possidetis agreement. Also the islands of Tobago, Saba, St Eustatius and Tortola, taken by the English in 1672, would have to be returned.
As the peace could not be communicated quickly to all parts of the world, different dates had been determined upon which legal hostilities would end. From the Soundings to the coast of Norway, fighting should end by 8 March; south to Tangier by 7 April; from there to the Equator by 5 May and in the rest of the world after 24 October 1674.

[[Intra-species recognition]]

CATEGORIES: Reproduction

Intra-species recognition is recognition by a member of a species of a conspecific (another member of the same species).  In many species, such recognition is necessary for procreation.
Different species may employ different methods, but all of them are based on one or more senses (after all, this is how the organism gather information about the environment). The recognition may happen by chemical signature (smell), by having a distinctive shape or color (sight), by emitting certain sounds (hearing), or even by behaviour patterns. Often a combination of these is used.
Among human beings, the sense of sight is usually in charge of recognizing other members of the same species, with maybe the subconscious help of smell. In particular, the human brain has a disproportionate amount of processing power dedicated to finely analyze the features of a human face. This is why we are able to distinguish basically all six billions of human beings from each other (barring look-alikes), and a human being from a similar species like some anthropomorphic ape, with only a quick glance.
Intra-species recognition systems are often subtle.  For example, ornithologists have great difficulty in distinguishing the chiffchaff from the willow warbler by eye, and there is no evidence that the birds themselves can do so other than by the different songs of the male.  Sometimes, too, intra-species recognition is fallible: in many species of frog, the males are not uncommonly seen copulating with females of the wrong species or even with inanimate objects.
Heliconius charithonia displays intra-species recognition by roosting with conspecifics.

Whitefish Bay  [tpl]coord|46|42|8|N|84|47|20|W|display=title|type:waterbody_region:US[/tpl] is a large bay on the eastern end of the southern shore of Lake Superior between Michigan and Ontario. It begins in the north and west at Whitefish Point in Michigan, about 10 miles north of Paradise, Michigan and ends at the St. Marys River at Sault Ste. Marie on the southeast. The eastern side of the bay on the Ontario side is more rugged, largely wilderness Canadian Shield.  The international boundary runs through the bay, which is heavily used by shipping traffic northbound and southbound from the Soo Locks. The Whitefish Point Light marks the entry of the bay, Ile Parisienne Light[tpl]cite rowlett|onnw|accessdate=22 November 2008[/tpl] is in the middle of the bay, and Point Iroquois Light lies near the mouth of the bay and the approach of the Soo Locks.  
Whitefish Bay became the site of numerous shipwrecks after the Soo Locks opened in 1855.  Many of the shipwrecks of Whitefish Bay are protected for future generations of sports divers by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve, including the wrecks of the Comet, John B. Cowle, Drake, Samuel Mather, Miztec, Myron, Niagara, John M. Osborn, Sagamore, [tpl]SS|Superior City||2[/tpl], and the Vienna.Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve 
Whitefish Point is the home of a former United States Coast Guard station and Whitefish Point Lighthouse is the oldest active light on Lake Superior. Part of the lighthouse station houses the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, which includes artifacts from the above shipwrecks and information on the wreck of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald. The Point is a popular place for rock collectors, ship watchers, and spectacular bird watching.  Whitefish Point's land and water provides a natural corridor for birds that makes it a migratory route of world significance.[tpl]cite web |title=Whitefish Point - Important Bird Area|url=http://iba.audubon.org/iba/viewSiteProfile.do?siteId=1653&navSite=state|accessdate=2 October 2010 |publisher= National Audubon Society 2010.

In physics, an anyon is a type of particle that occurs only in two-dimensional systems, with properties much less restricted than fermions and bosons; the operation of exchanging two identical particles may cause a global phase shift but cannot affect observables.  Anyons are generally classified as abelian or non-abelian, as explained below.  Abelian anyons have been detected and play a major role in the fractional quantum Hall effect.  Non-abelian anyons have not been definitively detected although this is an active area of research.

Shaw Nature Reserve, formerly known as Shaw Arboretum, is a [tpl]convert|2,400|acre|km2[/tpl] private nature reserve located in Gray Summit, Missouri, that is operated as an extension of the Missouri Botanical Garden.
The area was opened in 1925 when pollution from coal smoke in St. Louis threatened the garden's live plant collection, especially the orchid collection. The orchids were moved in 1926, but the pollution in St. Louis decreased with waning use of coal for heat, making it unnecessary to move the rest of the live plant collection.  It is currently dedicated to environmental education, to the maintenance and restoration of the region's native flora and fauna, and to public enjoyment of the natural world. 
The nature reserve has several historic homes (including the Joseph H. Bascom House), a large prairie, and a large wetland blind from which herons can be observed. Over 14 miles (23 km) of hiking trails run through the reserve.  In addition, wheelchair-accessible trails and scenic routes run through the reserve.  
Shaw Nature Reserve is open year round from 7a.m. till sunset.  Visitor Center hours are 8 to 4:30 on weekdays and 9 to 5 on weekends. Shaw Nature Reserve is open to hikers every day, but the Visitor Center is closed on some major holidays.  No pets are allowed on the grounds.  No reservations are required except in the case of an organized tour and for those wishing to participate in an education program.

[[British Ornithologists' Club]]

CATEGORIES: Ornithological organisations in the United Kingdom, Conservation in the United Kingdom, 1892 establishments in the United Kingdom, Organizations established in 1892, Organisations based in the United Kingdom

The British Ornithologists' Club (BOC) aims to promote discussion between members and others interested in ornithology, and to facilitate the dissemination of scientific information concerned with ornithology.  The BOC has a special interest in avian systematics, taxonomy and distribution.
The BOC was founded at a meeting of 15 members of the British Ornithologists' Union held in Covent Garden, London on 5 October 1892.  This was at a time when individuals and expeditions were exploring remote parts of the world, discovering many new species of birds in the process and the BOC was formed to enable members to meet regularly to present papers, exhibit specimens and engage in discussion on wider ornithological matters.  The BOC has continued to meet regularly in London (with occasional meetings elsewhere) and, as at June 2012, has held 970 meetings.  Meetings now take the form of a talk followed by discussion, with refreshments available afterwards. Meetings are free and are open to members and non-members alike.
The BOC has published The Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club  (The Bulletin or Bull. B.O.C.) since its formation.  The Bulletin, which is published four times a year, focuses in particular on avian systematics, taxonomy, nomenclature and distribution worldwide. It regularly contains papers:
•	describing new species and subspecies of birds;
•	giving an account of the rediscovery of a species not seen for many years;
•	describing for the first time the nest and/or breeding behaviour of a little-studied species;
•	giving an account of an expedition to a rarely visited part of the world, listing the species found (sometimes extending their known range) and commenting on the absence of species which previous expeditions had recorded,
•	suggesting the actual location where poorly documented museum specimens may have been taken and uncovering cases where specimens have been mislabelled.
The BOC has a membership of around 370 (2011) almost half of whom live outside the United Kingdom.  Membership is open to anyone with an interest in ornithology.  Members receive The Bulletin.
Full details of the BOC and how to join can be found on its website at http://www.boc-online.org
The BOC is a registered charity in England and Wales (no. 279583).

The Old Order German Baptist Brethren are a small group of Schwarzenau Brethren that split from the Old German Baptist Brethren (OGBB) in 1921, when members of the latter began to accept automobiles. Though similar to the OGBB in faith and practice, the Old Order German Baptist Brethren represent those who desired to maintain a strict adherence to tradition, such as the use of horse and buggy for transportation. As of 2000 the group had 125 members and a total population of 281 in 3 congregations in Ohio.Donald B. Kraybill, C. Nelson Hostetter: "Anabaptist World USA", Scottdale PA, 2001, pages 145, 156.

The Broad-winged Hawk (Buteo platypterus) is a small hawk of the genus Buteo. During the summer some subspecies are distributed over eastern North America, as far west as British Columbia and Texas; they then migrate south to winter in the neotropics from Mexico down to southern Brazil.[tpl]cite web|last=Lepage |first=D.|year= 2003|title= Broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus)|work=Avibase|url=http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/species.jsp?lang=EN&avibaseid=79F3C681417F2056[/tpl] Other subspecies are all-year residents on Caribbean islands.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] As in most raptors, females are slightly larger than males. Broad-winged Hawks' wings are relatively short and broad with a tapered, somewhat pointed appearance. There are two types of colouration: a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall. Although the Broad-winged Hawk's numbers are relatively stable, populations are declining in some parts of its breeding range because of forest fragmentation.

Dollar General Corporation is a U.S. chain of variety stores headquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. As of January 2012, Dollar General operated over 10,000 stores[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2012/01/26/article/dollar_stores_among_the_new_retail_powerhouses|title=Dollar stores among the new retail powerhouses|work=News & Record|date=2012-01-26|accessdate=2012-02-02[/tpl] in 40 U.S. states.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2011/01/03/article/dollar_general_to_open_625_new_stores|title=Dollar General to open 625 new stores|work=News & Record|agency=Associated Press|date=2011-01-03|accessdate=2011-01-03[/tpl][ref]
</ref>
Dollar General stores tend to locate in smaller communities than those where Walmart would go. The company acquired the 280 stores of the P.N. Hirsh Division of Interco, Inc. (now Heritage Home Group) in 1983, and in 1985 added 206 stores and a warehouse from Eagle Family Discount Stores, also from Interco, Inc. In recent years, the chain has started constructing more stand-alone stores, typically in areas not served by another general-merchandise retailer. In some cases, stores are within a few city blocks of each other.
Dollar General offers both name brand and generic merchandise — including off-brand goods and closeouts of name-brand items — in the same store, often on the same shelf. Although it has the word "dollar" in the name, Dollar General is not a dollar store. Most of its products are priced at more than $1.00. However, goods are usually sold at set price points of penny items and up to the range of 50 to 60 dollars, not counting phone cards and loadable store gift cards.
Dollar General often serves communities that are too small for Wal-Marts (although many locations are in relatively close driving distance to a Wal-Mart store or in the same communities that Wal-Mart is located). It competes in the dollar store format with national chains Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, regional chains such as Fred's in the southeast, and numerous independently owned stores.
Since the turn of the century, Dollar General has experimented with stores that carry a greater selection of grocery items. These stores, (similar to the Wal-Mart Supercenter, but much smaller), operate under the name "Dollar General Market".

[[Inferior good]]
CATEGORIES: Goods

In economics, an inferior good is a good that decreases in demand when consumer income rises (or rises in demand when consumer income decreases),Mankiw, N. Gregory, Principles of Economics, South-Western Cengage Learning, 2012, p.70 unlike normal goods, for which the opposite is observed.[ref]
</ref> Normal goods are those for which consumers' demand increases when their income increases.
[ref]
</ref> 
This would be the opposite of a superior good, one that is often associated with wealth and the wealthy, whereas an inferior good is often associated with lower socio-economic groups.
Inferiority, in this sense, is an observable fact relating to affordability rather than a statement about the quality of the good. As a rule, these goods are affordable and adequately fulfill their purpose, but as more costly substitutes that offer more pleasure (or at least variety) become available, the use of the inferior goods diminishes.
Depending on consumer or market indifference curves, the amount of a good bought can either increase, decrease, or stay the same when income increases.

CATEGORIES: Goods

In economics, normal goods are any goods for which demand increases when income increases, and falls when income decreases but price remains constant, i.e. with a positive income elasticity of demand.http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/normal-good.htmlThe Economist - Normal goods The term does not necessarily refer to the quality of the good, but an abnormal good would clearly not be in demand, except for possibly lower socioeconomic groups.
In particular, when the price of a normal good is zero, the demand is infinite.
Depending on the indifference curves, the amount of a good bought can either increase, decrease, or stay the same when income increases.  In the diagram below, good Y is a normal good since the amount purchased increases from Y1 to Y2 as the budget constraint shifts from BC1 to the higher income BC2.  Good X is an inferior good since the amount bought decreases from X1 to X2 as income increases.
Examples include Holidays, Cars, diamonds, branded fashions, hi-tech products etc.

[[Open-source record label]]

CATEGORIES: Open content, Record labels, Netlabels

Open-source record labels are a reaction against what some musicians see as corporate control of music via means of copyright. They believe that creativity requires that musicians reappropriate and reinterpret music and sounds to enable them to create truly innovative music. 
Open source record labels hold that the fight over free, libre, and open content and media is a struggle over the freedoms of expression and speech, with the goal of radically opening up the possibilities of media through open collaboration. To this end, open source record labels attempt to release music under so-called "copyleft", a license that enables musicians to develop music collaboratively and equitably and then release it into the same license. There can thus be many versions of a single track or reuse of the same sounds for multiple tracks with no direct permission needed. Open remixing and altering is not just allowed but promoted. The user base can be the creator and collaborator for the platform because of the open license.

The Vickers 6-Ton Tank or Vickers Mark E was a British light tank designed as a private project at Vickers. It was not purchased by the British Army, but was picked up by a large number of foreign armed forces and was licenced with few improvements by the Soviets as the T-26. It was also the direct predecessor of the Polish 7TP tank. By the start of World War II it was the second most common tank design in the world after the Renault FT.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

The citron is a fragrant citrus fruit, botanically classified as Citrus medica by both the Swingle and Tanaka systems. The designation medica given it by Linnaeus apparently is derived from its ancient name, "Median or Persian apple",Cedrát - Citrus medica a Citrus limonimedica that was reported by Theophrastus,Theophrastus, Enquiry into Plants, IV.4.2. who believed it to be native to Persia or the land of the Medes; there is no relation to medicinal uses of the fruit. Theophrastus notes its smooth sharp thorns, like those of a pear, the very fragrant, but inedible 'apple', which keeps moths from clothes, and the fact that "it bears its 'apples' at all season; for when some have been gathered, the flower of others is on the tree and it is ripening others... This tree, as has been said, grows in Persia and Media." Citron was the first of the citrus fruits to appear in the Mediterranean Basin.
The fruit's name derives ultimately from Latin, citrus, also the origin of the genus name, and as a result it has many similar names in many European languages, e.g. cederat, cédrat, cedro, etc. A source of confusion is that citron or similar words in French, Hungarian, Finnish, Latvian, the West Slavic languages, and all Germanic languages but English are false friends, as they refer to the lemon. Indeed, into the 16th century, the English name citron included the lemon and perhaps the lime as well.Citron at the Oxford English dictionary http://www.oed.com/ Most other European languages, from Albanian and English to Spanish, use variants of the Arabic word laymun "limon".

The Marine Raiders were elite units established by the United States Marine Corps during World War II to conduct amphibious light infantry warfare, particularly in landing in rubber boats and operating behind the lines. "Edson's" Raiders of 1st Marine Raiders Battalion and "Carlson's" Raiders of 2nd Marine Raiders Battalion are said to be the first United States special operations forces to form and see combat in World War II.
However, most combat operations saw the Raiders employed as regular infantry, and combined with the resentment within the rest of the Marines that the Raiders were an "elite force within an elite force", led to the eventual abandonment of the experiment.
Four Raider battalions served operationally but all were disbanded on 8 January 1944 when the Corps made the doctrinal decision that the Raiders had out-lived their original mission.  The changing nature of the war in the Pacific, with many large-scale amphibious assaults to come against well-defended islands, negated the requirements for small light units that could strike deep into enemy territory.
On 1 February 1944 the 1st Raider Regiment was redesignated the 4th Marine Regiment, thus assuming the lineage of the regiment that had garrisoned Shanghai in the interwar years and fought so gallantly on Bataan and Corregidor. The 1st, 3rd, and 4th Raider Battalions became respectively the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions of the 4th Marines. The 2nd Raider Battalion filled out the regimental weapons company. Personnel in the Raider Training Center transferred to the newly formed 5th Marine Division. Leavened with new men, the 4th Marines went on to earn additional distinctions in the assaults on Guam and Okinawa. At the close of the war, the regiment joined the occupation forces in Japan and participated in the release from POW compounds of the remaining members of the old 4th Marines.

Emperor Hui of Jin, sim. ch. 晋惠帝, trad. ch. 晉惠帝, py. jìn huì dì, wg. Chin Hui-ti (259-poisoned January 8, 307), personal name Sima Zhong (司馬衷), courtesy name Zhengdu (正度), was the second emperor of the Jin Dynasty (265-420). Emperor Hui was a developmentally disabled ruler, and throughout his reign, there was constant internecine fighting between regents, imperial princes (his uncles and cousins), and his wife Empress Jia Nanfeng for the right to control him (and therefore the imperial administration), causing great suffering for the people and greatly undermining the stability of the Jin regime, eventually leading to Wu Hu rebellions that led to Jin's loss of northern and central China and the establishment of the competing Sixteen Kingdoms.  He was briefly deposed by his granduncle Sima Lun, who usurped the throne himself, in 301, but later that year was restored to the throne and continued to be the emperor until 307, when he was poisoned, likely by the regent Sima Yue.

The Marchantiophyta [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Marchantiophyta.ogg|m|ɑr|ˌ|k|æ|n|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|f|ɨ|t|ə[/tpl] are a division of non-vascular bryophyte land plants commonly referred to as hepatics or liverworts. Like other bryophytes, they have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information.
It is estimated that there are about 9000 species of liverworts. Some of the more familiar species grow as a flattened leafless thallus, but most species are leafy with a form very much like a flattened moss.  Leafy species can be distinguished from the apparently similar mosses on the basis of a number of features, including their single-celled rhizoids. Leafy liverworts also differ from most (but not all) mosses in that their leaves never have a costa (present in many mosses) and may bear marginal cilia (very rare in mosses). Other differences are not universal for all mosses and liverworts, but the occurrence of leaves arranged in three ranks, the presence of deep lobes or segmented leaves, or a lack of clearly differentiated stem and leaves all point to the plant being a liverwort.
Liverworts are typically small, usually from 2–20 mm wide with individual plants less than 10 cm long, and are therefore often overlooked.  However, certain species may cover large patches of ground, rocks, trees or any other reasonably firm substrate on which they occur. They are distributed globally in almost every available habitat, most often in humid locations although there are desert and arctic species as well. Some species can be a nuisance in shady green-houses or a weed in gardens.Schuster, Rudolf M. The Hepaticae and Anthocerotae of North America, volume VI, page 19.

The Panzerkampfwagen 35(t), commonly shortened to Panzer 35(t) or abbreviated as Pz.Kpfw. 35(t), was a Czechoslovak-designed light tank used mainly by Nazi Germany during World War II. The letter (t) stood for tschechisch (German: "Czech"). In Czechoslovak service it had the formal designation Lehký tank vzor 35 (Light Tank Model 35), but was commonly referred to as the LT vz. 35 or LT-35. Four hundred and thirty-four were built; of these the Germans seized two hundred and forty-four when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired fifty-two when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania. In German service it saw combat during the early years of World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942. It was used for the remainder of the war by other countries and as a training tank in Bulgaria into the 1950s.

Call of Duty is a 2003 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision.Gamespot - Call of Duty Retrieved on September 23, 2007 The game simulates the infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II. The game is based on the Quake III: Team Arena engine. It was accompanied in September 2004 by an expansion pack, Call of Duty: United Offensive, which was produced by Activision, and developed by Gray Matter Interactive, with contributions from Pi Studios. Call of Duty is similar in theme and gameplay to Medal of Honor, as it is made out of single-player campaigns and missions. However, unlike Medal of Honor, the war is seen not just from the viewpoint of an American soldier but also from the viewpoint of British, Canadian, and Soviet soldiers.
The game was somewhat unusual at the time in that throughout the single-player mode the player is joined by computer-controlled allies who range in quantity from two infantrymen (in some of the British missions) to an entire regiment of tanks (in the Soviet missions). The computer-controlled allies will support the actual player during the missions. They also further the game's goal of providing an immersive and realistic experience; that is, soldiers in World War II were usually part of a larger group, as opposed to the "lone wolf" seen in video games such as Medal of Honor. However, there are some missions where the player is alone.
The "Hardened" and "Prestige" editions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, released on November 10, 2009, includes a redemption code to download the game onto Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 hard drives, retitling it as Call of Duty Classic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/100/1003351p1.html |title=Modern Warfare 2's 'Prestige Edition' Is Insane |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2009-07-13 |publisher=IGN[/tpl]

Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000... An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing [tpl]convert|250|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] network of concrete walls, high-tech fencing and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank.

IDF spokeswoman Meir said Israeli military operations that disrupted militants planning attacks from the West Bank also deserved credit for the drop in Israeli fatalities.[/tpl] [/tpl]
Opponents of the barrier object that the route substantially deviates from the Green Line into the occupied territories captured by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967.

Until the start of the current round of violence (the second intifada, in September 2000), 85,000 Israelis and Palestinians used to pour into Qalquilya every week to visit the shops and markets.

With its bottleneck entrance so often corked, the town is coming close to economic strangulation. More than 600 businesses have closed and many residents have been unable to pay their municipal taxes, with the result that the Qalquilya municipality owes approximately 3.5 m shekels (£490,000) to the Israeli Electric Company, which is threatening to cut off the city's supply. ... The story of overcrowding and economic peril will be repeated in other Palestinian cities, according to Jamal Juma, co-ordinator of the Palestinian Environmental Network: 'In 10 years, there will be no room to expand.

[[Gate count]]

CATEGORIES: Semiconductor device fabrication

In microprocessor design, gate count refers to the number of gates build with transistor and other electronic devices, that are needed to implement a design. Even with today's process technology providing what was formerly considered impossible numbers of gates on a single chip, gate counts remain one of the most important overall factors in the end price of a chip. Designs with fewer gates will typically cost less, and for this reason gate count remains a commonly used metric in the industry.
The term can also refer to the number of persons entering an event (such as a sports event) http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2002/03/11/editorial4.html or a library http://www.niso.org/emetrics/current/category7.1.html during a specified period.

Jack Charles Stanmore Agazarian (27 August 1915 – 29 March 1945) was a British espionage agent who worked for the Special Operations Executive (SOE) inside France.  He was captured and killed by the Nazis when he sought to confirm the status of a resistance cell that the Nazis had compromised.
Agazarian was born in London, to an Armenian father, Berdge Rupen Agazarian, and French mother, Jacqueline Marie-Louise Le Chevalier Agazarian, the second of six children.  He was educated in both France and England at Dulwich College.  After completing his education he worked with his father in the family business.
After joining the Royal Air Force at the outbreak of World War II, he was recruited as a wireless operator by the SOE.  His younger brother, Noel Agazarian, also joined the Royal Air Force but as a Spitfire pilot; he went on to be a flying ace in the Battle of Britain before being killed in action on 16 May 1941.
In December 1942 Agazarian arrived in Paris to join the newly formed Prosper network of the SOE and was joined later by his wife Francine. He occasionally worked for Henri Dericourt, a former French Air Force pilot whose job was to find landing grounds and arrange receptions for SOE agents arriving by air. At this time he began to question Dericourt's loyalty and reported to London his own and other agents' suspicions.
Agazarian became known to the Gestapo, and on several occasions he narrowly escaped arrest.
SOE Circuit leader Francis Suttill considered Agazarian's continued presence to be a security risk. On 16 June 1943 Agazarian was returned to England where he reiterated his concerns about Dericourt's loyalty to Nicholas Bodington and Maurice Buckmaster, who were nevertheless unconvinced. However, when agent Noor Inyat Khan lost contact with the Prosper group, headquarters became increasingly concerned. Leo Marks, the SOE's head of codes and ciphers, became convinced that Gilbert Norman, the group's wireless operator, was transmitting under German control.
Agazarian joined Bodington (who was still sceptical) in a mission to France to determine the status of the Prosper network, departing 22 July 1943. Bodington, working through headquarters, arranged a meeting with Gilbert Norman at a pre-arranged address in the rue de Rome near Gare St-Lazare, but it was Agazarian, not Bodington who went to the meeting. 
The concerns about the Prosper network proved well-founded. German forces had indeed compromised the network, and Agazarian was taken prisoner at the meeting. Three members of the network, courier Andrée Borrel, leader Francis Suttill and wireless operator Gilbert Norman, had been in custody since 23 June, and Norman's transmissions had indeed been made by the Germans. Henri Dericourt's role in the loss of the Prosper network remains unclear; after the war he was tried as a double agent, but acquitted for lack of evidence. In fact he was a triple agent working for Secret Intelligence Service and that the SOE agents had been sacrificed to distract German attentions from landings in Sicily and Normandy.
The arrest of Agazarian, who knew a great deal about the Prosper network, was a massive coup for the Germans.  He endured torture for six months at Fresnes prison and was then  moved to Flossenbürg concentration camp. After being kept there in solitary confinement, Agazarian was executed on 29 March 1945.
Jack Agazarian is honored on the Runnymede Memorial in Surrey, England, on the SOE memorial at Flossenbürg and also on the Roll of Honor on the Valençay SOE Memorial in Valençay, in the Indre département of France

In medieval England and Scotland the Chief Justiciar (later known simply as the Justiciar) was roughly equivalent to a modern Prime Minister[tpl]fact|date=May 2012[/tpl] as the monarch's chief minister. Similar positions existed on the European Continent, particularly in Norman Italy. The term is the English form of the medieval Latin justiciarius or justitiarius ("man of justice", i.e. judge).
A similar office was formed in Scotland, though there were usually two or three, the Justiciar of Scotia and Justiciar of Lothian (and in the 13th century the Justiciar of Galloway), these offices later evolving into a national one called Lord Justice-General.
Following the conquest of the Principality of Wales in the 13th century, the areas that became personal fiefs of the English monarchs were placed under the control of the Justiciar of North Wales and the Justiciar of South Wales.

Norman was born in Saint-Cloud, Hauts-de-Seine, to an English father and a French mother and was educated in France and England. He joined the army, receiving a commission in the Durham Light Infantry in November 1940[tpl]London Gazette|issue=34995|date=15 November 1940|startpage=6626 |supp=yes|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] and was subsequently recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE). In November 1942, he was sent into France to join the newly formed Prosper network, but on 24 June 1943 was arrested by the Gestapo, together with cell leader Francis Suttill and courier Andrée Borrel.
Norman was taken to the Paris headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst at 84 Avenue Foch. The Germans used Norman's captured wireless set to transmit their own false messages to SOE Headquarters in Baker Street.  Norman attempted to warn London that he was in captivity by not giving the Germans the second part of his security check, which they did not know about, but was frustrated when London sent a curt reply telling him to correct the omission.  
The Germans were thus able to set a trap which resulted in the capture of Jack Agazarian who had been sent with Nicholas Bodington to investigate the fate of the Prosper network.  Norman was shipped to Mauthausen concentration camp, where he was executed on 6 September 1944. 
Major Gilbert Norman is honoured on the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey, England and as also on the "Roll of Honour" on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre departément of France.

[[Acts of Supremacy]]

CATEGORIES: 1534 in law, 1534 in England, Constitutional laws of England, Parliamentary Acts of the English Reformation, Acts of the Parliament of England concerning religion

The first Act of Supremacy was a piece of legislation that granted King Henry VIII of England Royal Supremacy, which means that he was declared the supreme head of the Church of England. It is still the legal authority of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom.  Royal Supremacy is specifically used to describe the legal sovereignty of the civil laws over the laws of the Church in England.
The Act of Supremacy of November 1534 (26 Hen. VIII c. 1) was an Act of the Parliament of England under King Henry VIII declaring that he was "the only supreme head on earth of the Church of England" and that the English crown shall enjoy "all honours, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity.""Henry VIII's Act of Supremacy (1534)- original text" English History. David Ross and Britain Express The wording of the Act made clear that Parliament was not granting the King the title (thereby suggesting that they had the right to withdraw it later); rather, it was acknowledging an established fact. In the Act of Supremacy, Henry abandoned Rome completely. He thereby asserted the independence of the Ecclesia Anglicana. He appointed himself and his successors as the supreme rulers of the English church. Henry had been declared "Defender of the Faith" (Fidei Defensor) in 1521 by Pope Leo X for his pamphlet accusing Martin Luther of heresy.[tpl]CathEncy | title=Henry VIII | id=07222a | last=Thurston | first=Herbert [/tpl] Parliament later conferred this title upon Henry in 1544.[tpl]Cite EB1911|title=Defender of the Faith |url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.com/Defender_of_the_Faith[/tpl] 
The 1534 Act is often taken to mark the beginning of the English Reformation, although other sources suggest that it had been brewing for more than a century. There were a number of reasons for this Act, primarily the need for Henry to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, because Catherine had not produced a son and heirLoades, David, Henry VIII and His Queens, England: Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, 1994, 179 pages (and because of Henry's alleged misgivings about the legitimacy of his marriage to his late brother's wife). Pope Clement VII still refused to grant the annulment, due to the familial connections Catherine had with the Holy Roman Emperor at the time (and fear caused by Charles V's sacking of Rome in 1527). The Treasons Act was later passed: it provided that to disavow the Act of Supremacy and to deprive the King of his "dignity, title, or name" was to be considered treason."Treason Act, 1534" English Reformation Sources. Julie P. McFerran, 2003-2004 The most famous public figure to resist the Treason Act was Sir Thomas More.
This Act was repealed in 1554 by King Henry's elder daughter, Queen Mary I.[tpl]cite book|title=Constitutional Law of England | first=Edward Wavell | last=Ridges | page=312 | edition=2 | publisher=Stevens & Sons | location=London | year=1915[/tpl]

[[Panther tank]]

CATEGORIES: Medium tanks of Germany, World War II medium tanks, World War II tanks of Germany

Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Nazi Germany in World War II from mid-1943 to the end of the European war in 1945. It was intended as a counter to the Soviet T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II.Hart 2003, pp. 41–43.
Until 1944, it was designated as the Panzerkampfwagen V ''Panther and had the ordnance inventory designation of 'Sd.Kfz. 171.''' On 27 February 1944, Hitler ordered that the Roman numeral V be deleted from the designation.
The Panther tank was a compromise of various requirements. While having essentially the same engine as the Tiger I tank, it had better frontal armor (including the benefit of a sloped armor, increasing effective armor depth), better gun penetration, was lighter and thus faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tigers. The tradeoff was weaker side armor. The Panther proved to be deadly in open country and long range engagements, but vulnerable in close-quarters combat. Also, the 75 mm gun fired a slightly smaller shell than the Tiger's 88 mm gun, providing less high explosive firepower against infantry.
The Panther was also far cheaper to produce than the Tiger tanks, and only slightly more expensive than the Panzer IV, as its design came to fruition when the Reich Ministry of Armament and War Production was making great efforts to increase war production. Key elements of the Panther design, such as its armor, transmission, and final drive, were compromises made specifically to improve production rates and address Germany's war shortages, whereas other elements such as its highly compact engine and its complex suspension system remained with their elegant but complicated engineering. The result was that Panther tank production was far higher than what was possible for the Tiger tanks, but not much higher than what had been accomplished with the Panzer IV. At the same time, the simplified final drive became the single major cause of breakdowns of the Panther tank, and was a problem that was never corrected.
The Panther tank arrived in 1943 at a crucial phase in World War II for Germany. Rushed into combat at the Battle of Kursk with un-corrected teething problems, which resulted in breakdowns and other equipment failures, the Panther tank would thereafter only be fighting outnumbered in Germany's steady retreat against the Allies for the remainder of World War II. Its success as a battlefield weapon was thus hampered by Germany's generally declining position in the war, with the loss of airpower protection by the Luftwaffe, the loss of fuel and training space, and the declining quality of tank crews. Nevertheless, the Panther tank commanded respect from the Allies, and its combat capabilities led directly to the introduction of heavier Allied tanks such as the Soviet IS-2 and the American M26 Pershing into the war and the development of the formidable British Centurion Tank, even though it appeared too late to participate in World War II.

Frauenliebe und -leben (A Woman's Love and Life) is a cycle of poems by Adelbert von Chamisso, written in 1830. They describe the course of a woman's love for her man, from her point of view, from first meeting through marriage to his death, and after. Selections were set to music as a song-cycle by masters of German Lied, namely Carl Loewe, Franz Paul Lachner and Robert Schumann. The setting by Schumann (his opus 42) is now the most widely known.

The Soo Locks (sometimes spelled Sault Locks, but pronounced "soo") are a set of parallel locks which enable ships to travel between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes.  They are located on the St. Marys River between Lake Superior and Lake Huron, between the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario.  They bypass the rapids of the river, where the water falls 21 feet (7 m).
The locks pass an average of 10,000 ships per year,[tpl]cite web| title = USACE – Detroit District – Facts| accessdate = 2008-10-22| url = http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/newsandevents/publications/publications/soolocks-saultste-marie/facts/[/tpl] despite being closed during the winter from January through March, when ice shuts down shipping on the Great Lakes.  The winter closure period is used to inspect and maintain the locks.
The locks share a name (usually shortened and anglicized as Soo) with the two cities named Sault Ste. Marie, in Ontario and in Michigan, located on either side of the St. Marys River.  The Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge between the United States and Canada permits vehicular traffic to pass over the locks.  A railroad bridge crosses the St. Marys River just upstream of the highway bridge.

James Forten (September 2, 1766 – March 4, 1842) was an African-American abolitionist and wealthy businessman in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Born free in the city, he became a sailmaker after the American Revolutionary War. After an apprenticeship, he became foreman and bought the sail loft when his boss retired. Based on equipment he developed, he built a highly profitable business. It was located on the busy waterfront of the Delaware River, in the area now called Penn's Landing. 
Forten used his wealth and standing to work for civil rights for African Americans in the city and nationally. Beginning in 1817, he opposed the colonization movements, particularly that of the American Colonization Society. He affirmed African Americans' claims of a stake in their nation of the United States, arguing for gaining civil rights in this country. He persuaded William Lloyd Garrison to an anti-colonization position, and helped fund his newspaper The Liberator (1831-1865), frequently publishing letters on public issues. He became vice-president of the biracial American Anti-Slavery Society, founded in 1833, and worked for national abolition of slavery, and for black education and temperance. His large family was also devoted to these causes, and two daughters married the Purvis brothers, who used their wealth as leaders for abolition.

[[First Things First 1964 manifesto]]

CATEGORIES: Graphic design, Art manifestos, Design, Design history

The First Things First manifesto was written 29 November 1963 and published in 1964 by Ken Garland. It was backed by over 400 graphic designers and artists and also received the backing of Tony Benn, radical left-wing MP and activist, who published it in its entirety in the Guardian newspaper.
Reacting against a rich and affluent Britain of the 1960s, it tried to re-radicalise a design industry which the signatories felt had become lazy and uncritical. Drawing on ideas shared by Critical Theory, the Frankfurt School and the counter-culture of the time it explicitly re-affirmed the belief that Design is not a neutral, value-free process.
It rallied against the consumerist culture that was purely concerned with buying and selling things and tried to highlight a Humanist dimension to graphic design theory. It was later updated and republished with a new group of signatories as the First Things First 2000 manifesto.

CATEGORIES: Graphic design, Art manifestos

The First Things First 2000 manifesto, launched by Adbusters magazine in 1999, was an updated version of the earlier First Things First manifesto written and published in 1964 by Ken Garland, a British designer.
The 2000 manifesto was signed by a group of 33 figures from the international graphic design community, many of them well known, and simultaneously published in Adbusters (Canada), Emigre (Issue 51)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emigre.com/EMag.php?issue=51 |title=Back Issues: Emigre 51 |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl] and AIGA Journal of Graphic Design (United States), Eye magazine no. 33 vol. 8, Autumn 1999,[tpl]cite web|author=http://www.ae-pro.com |url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=18&fid=99 |title=eye | feature |publisher=Eyemagazine.com |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl] Blueprint (Britain) and Items (Netherlands). The manifesto was subsequently published in many other magazines and books around the world, sometimes in translation. Its aim was to generate discussion about the graphic design profession's priorities in the design press and at design schools. Some designers welcomed this attempt to reopen the debate, while others rejected the manifesto.
The question of value-free design has been continually contested in the graphic design community between those who are concerned about the need for values in design and those who believe it should be value-free.[tpl]cite web |url=http://idie.enclavexquise.com/idie-index-archief.html#IDIEmission |title=IDIE: Innovation and Design for Information Empowerment 1.0 Archive |first=Jouke |last=Kleerebezem |date=21 September 1999 |accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://idie.enclavexquise.com/idclist.html |title=discussion at the InfoDesign-Café mailing list |date=24 September 1999 |accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] Those who believe that design can be free from values reject the idea that graphic designers should concern themselves with underlying political questions. Those who are concerned about values believe that designers should be critical and take a stand in their choice of work, for instance by not promoting industries and products perceived to be harmful. Examples of projects that might be classified as unacceptable include many forms of advertising and designs for cigarette manufacturers, arms companies and so on. Adbusters has been a significant outlet for these ideas, especially in its commitment to detournement and culture jamming.[tpl]cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/gcp/pdf/culturejamsandmemewarfare.pdf |title=Culture Jams and Meme Warfare: Kalle Lasn, Adbusters, and media activism |author=Wendi Pickerel |coauthors=Helena Jorgensen and Lance Bennett |date=April 19, 2002 |accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Culture Jam: How to Reverse America's Suicidal Consumer Binge--And Why We Must |first=Kalle |last=Lasn |isbn=0-688-17805-7 |date=2000[/tpl]

Carlo Antonio Campioni (November 16, 1720 – April 12, 1788), also known as Carlo Antonio Campione or Charles Antoine Campion, was an Italian composer, as well as a collector of early music.
Campioni was born in Lunéville in France. Not much is known about his education in music. Anton Raaff believes Campioni studied violin with Giuseppe Tartini in Padua.
From 1763 until his death, he was maestro di cappella to the Grand Duke of Florence. He died in Florence.
He wrote music in a variety of forms, but was particularly prolific in instrumental music, publishing several sets of trio sonatas.Chamber Music By John H. Baron p. 296 Routledge, 2002 A setting of the Salve regina  is his only published work of sacred music, though he did write more sacred works, such as Requiems for Franz I and Maria Theresa, and a Te Deum celebrating the birth of Francis II.
The music of Campioni circulated in Europe in many different editions and combinations. To this day, a catalogue of Campioni's music put together by at-the-time Ambassador Thomas Jefferson is useful to musicologists in studying Campioni's oeuvre.

James McCune Smith (April 18, 1813 – November 17, 1865) was an American physician, apothecary, abolitionist, and author. He is the first African American to hold a medical degree and graduated at the top in his class at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.  He was the first African American to run a pharmacy in the United States.
In addition to practicing as a doctor for nearly 20 years at the Colored Orphan Asylum in Manhattan, Smith was a public intellectual: he contributed articles to medical journals, participated in learned societies, and wrote numerous essays and articles drawing from his medical and statistical training.  He used his training in medicine and statistics to refute common misconceptions about race, intelligence, medicine, and society in general. Invited as a founding member of the New York Statistics Society in 1852, which promoted a new science, he was elected as a member in 1854 of the recently founded American Geographic Society.  But, he was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local medical associations.
He has been most well known for his leadership as an abolitionist; a member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, with Frederick Douglass he helped start the National Council of Colored People in 1853, the first permanent national organization for blacks.  Douglass said that Smith was "the single most important influence on his life."Morgan (2006), p. 612 Smith was one of the Committee of Thirteen, who organized in 1850 in New York City to resist the newly passed Fugitive Slave Law by aiding fugitive slaves through the Underground Railroad.  Other leading abolitionist activists were among his friends and colleagues. From the 1840s, he lectured on race and abolitionism and wrote numerous articles to refute racist ideas about black capacities.
Both Smith and his wife were of mixed-race African and European ancestry. As he became economically successful, he built a house in a good neighborhood; in the 1860 census he and his family were classified in that neighborhood as white, whereas in 1850 they were classified as mulatto. He served for nearly 20 years as the doctor at the Colored Orphan Asylum in New York but, after it was burned down in July 1863 by a mob in the New York Draft Riots, in which nearly 100 blacks died, Smith moved his family and practice out to Brooklyn for safety. The parents stressed education for their children. In the 1870 census, his widow and children continued to be classified as white. To escape racial discrimination, his children passed into white society: the four surviving sons married white spouses; his unmarried daughter lived with a brother. They worked as teachers, a lawyer, and business people.
Smith's unique achievements as a pioneering African-American doctor were rediscovered by twentieth-century historians. They were relearned by his descendants in the twenty-first century when a three-times-great-granddaughter took a history class and found his name in her grandmother's family bible. In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn. They gathered to honor him and their African-American ancestry.

[[Gridlock]]
CATEGORIES: Road transport

The term gridlock is defined as, "A state of severe road congestion arising when continuous queues of vehicles block an entire network of intersecting streets, bringing traffic in all directions to a complete standstill; a traffic jam of this kind."Gridlock. oed.com. Oxford University Press. Retrieve May 3, 2011, from  The term originates from a situation possible in a grid plan where intersections are blocked, preventing vehicles from either moving forwards through the intersection or backing up to an upstream intersection.
The term gridlock is also incorrectly used to describe high traffic congestion with minimal flow, which is simply a traffic jam), where a blocked grid system is not involved. By extension, the term has been applied to situations in other fields where flow is stalled by excess demand, or in which competing interests prevent progress.

[[Middle name]]
CATEGORIES: Human names

People's names in several cultures include one or more additional names placed between the first given name and the surname.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/381383/middle-name |title=middle name (language) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/middle%20name |title=Middle name - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=[/tpl] Middle names could be either given names (like in Anthony Michael Hall) or surnames (like in George Walker Bush). 
In Canada and the United States, such names are specifically referred to as middle name(s); in most European countries they would simply be regarded as second, third, etc. given names. In some countries there is usually only one middle name, and in the United States it is often abbreviated to the middle initial (e.g. James Ronald Bass becomes James R. Bass, which is usually standard for signatures) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just James Bass). In the United Kingdom he would usually be referred to either as James Bass, J. R. Bass or James Ronald Bass, or he may choose Ronald Bass, and informally there may be familiar shortenings. An individual may have more than one given name, or none. In some other countries, the term middle name is only used for names that are originally last names, but not part of the last name of the bearer (for instance one can have one's mother's maiden name as a middle name).
It is debatable how long middle names have existed in English speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly much earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender James Francis Edward Stuart (1688–1766).
Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase "middle name" was not recorded until 1835 in the periodical Harvardiana. Since 1905, "middle name" gained a figurative connotation meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase "discretion is my middle name."
The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] by the increased use of computer databases that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such databases under their full name. Especially in the case of government records and other databases that are used for legal purposes, this phenomenon has sometimes been criticized[tpl]By whom|date=September 2009[/tpl] as a form of discrimination against people who carry multiple middle names for cultural or religious reasons.
In the United States, the "middle initial or a religious initial" can be used to replace a middle name even if the name is not printed on a birth certificate. It is sometimes used in place of the middle name on identity documents, passports, driver licenses, social security cards, university diplomas, and other official documents. Examples of this form include George W. Bush and John D. Rockefeller.  The abbreviation "N.M.N." (no middle name) or "N.M.I." (no middle initial) is sometimes used in formal documents where a middle initial or name is expected when the person does not have one.
