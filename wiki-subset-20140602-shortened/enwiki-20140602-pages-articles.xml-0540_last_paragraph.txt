[[Toxic Twins]]
CATEGORIES: Aerosmith, Songwriting teams

The Toxic Twins is a nickname given to lead singer Steven Tyler and lead guitarist Joe Perry of American hard rock band Aerosmith. They were given that name in the 1970s, due to their rampant use of drugs both on and off stage, which was a "toxic" combination that almost ended their careers and their lives.
To this day, they are still commonly referred to by this nickname, despite coming clean and maintaining sobriety for over 20 years. Their camaraderie can be viewed in several of the band's videos, such as The Making of Pump, Big Ones You Can Look At, and You Gotta Move.
An accomplished songwriting duo, the Toxic Twins are often referred to as the "Tyler/Perry" partnership in songwriting and have written over 85 songs together.

[[Phidippus audax]]
CATEGORIES: Animals described in 1845, Salticidae, Spiders of North America

Phidippus audax is a common jumping spider of North America. It is commonly referred to as the daring jumping spider, or bold jumping spider. The average size of adults ranges from roughly [tpl]convert|13|-|20|mm[/tpl] in length. They are typically black with a pattern of spots and striped on their abdomen and legs. Often these spots are orange-tinted in juveniles, turning white as the spider matures.  The spider belongs to the genus Phidippus, a group of jumping spiders easily identified both by their relatively large size and their iridescent chelicerae. In the case of P. audax, these chelicerae are a bright, metallic green or blue.
These spiders have been known to jump from 10 to 50 times their own body length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs,[tpl]Cite book|author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D.|title=Invertebrate Zoology|publisher=Brooks / Cole|edition=7|isbn=0-03-025982-7|year=2004|pages=571–584[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|title=Tree of Life Web Project: Salticidae - Jumping Spiders|url=http://tolweb.org/Salticidae[/tpl] and the male may jump away during mating if the female approaches too quickly.[tpl]Cite web|title=The Daring Jumping Spider: Phidippus audax|url=http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/CoopExt/4DMG/Pests/jumping.htm[/tpl]
Like other jumping spiders, due to their large, forward-facing eyes, they have very good stereoscopic vision. This aids them when stalking prey, and allows some visual communication with others of their species, such as courting 'dances'.

CATEGORIES: People in alternative medicine, 1969 deaths, 1894 births, American mass murderers

Robert Vernon Spears (June 26, 1894 - May 2, 1969) was a naturopath who is alleged to have placed a bomb aboard National Airlines Flight 967, an aircraft which disappeared over the Gulf of Mexico on November 16, 1959, killing 42 people. 
Investigators learned that William Taylor, a felon whom Spears had befriended when they were cellmates, had boarded Flight 967 using a ticket made out to "Dr. Spears". The theory arose that Spears, desperate because unlicensed naturopaths would soon be forbidden to practice in his home state of Texas, had tricked Taylor into boarding the aircraft with a piece of luggage containing a bomb; when the aircraft crashed, it would be assumed that Spears was on board. His wife (who had just given birth to twins) would then cash in an insurance policy for $100,000 on Spears' life. However, Taylor himself purchased $37,500.00 worth of life insurance at the airport; when his ex-wife attempted to collect on that policy, authorities were notified. It was determined that Taylor had boarded the flight using a ticket issued for Spears. 
Spears was eventually arrested at the Phoenix, Arizona airport after being turned in by another fellow cellmate who was also practicing as a naturopath in Arizona. The informant cut a deal with prosecutors to have marijuana charges against him dropped. He also asked for a share of a reward that had been posted for the capture of Spears. Due to lack of evidence, however, Spears was never charged with any offence in relation to the Flight 967 crash.

CATEGORIES: 76 mm artillery, World War II tank guns, World War II artillery of the United States, Tank guns

The 76 mm gun M1 was an American World War II-era tank gun, which replaced the 75 mm gun on late Medium tank M4s, and was used for all 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 tank destroyers. The short-barreled, medium-velocity 75 mm M3 L/40 gun (which armed the standard M4 Sherman) was designed primarily as an infantry support weapon and fared poorly against the armor of German Panzer IV and StuG III tanks (with even worse performance against the Panther and Tiger), leading to calls for a higher velocity weapon.
The new 76mm gun represented a much needed increase in anti-tank performance, allowing the Sherman to easily engage the most common German armored vehicles like the Panzer IV and Stug III. When using HVAP (High Velocity Armor Piercing) rounds the M4 was able to engage the heavier Tiger I and Panther from normal combat ranges. Years later, during the Korean War, the 76mm Shermans were able to easily penetrate the Soviet T-34/85 tanks from typical combat ranges.

Marc Quiñones is a percussionist, a longtime player in salsa music, and a member of the Southern rock group The Allman Brothers Band since 1991.  He is of Puerto Rican ancestry.
Born in The Bronx, New York, he began playing drums and congas at the age of three and was playing professionally at the age of nine.Doerschuk, Robert L. (2009) "Marc Quiñones: The Other Allman Brother", DRUM!, July 28, 2009, retrieved 2011-07-02  In his youth he played timbales with Latin music stars such as Tito Puente and co-founded a group named Los Rumberitos.  At the age of 17 he joined the salsa music band of Rafael de Jesús.Álava, Silvio H. (2007) Spanish Harlem's Musical Legacy: 1930-1980, Arcadia Publishing, ISBN 978-0-7385-5006-0, p. 83
Quiñones spent the next five years in salsa master Willie Colón's band, playing every percussion instrument at one time or another.  His ability to sight-read music led to his becoming musical director of the band for the last two years; he also co-produced one of Colon's albums.  He then spent two years playing with Rubén Blades as well as playing on and touring for David Byrne's Latin music Rei Momo project.  In 1989 Quiñones joined the jazz fusion band Spyro Gyra where he played for two years.
After a chance meeting with Butch Trucks in 1991, he was recruited to join The Allman Brothers Band.Larkin, Colin (2002) The Virgin Encyclopedia of 70s Music, Virgin Books, ISBN 1-85227-947-8, p. 14  There he plays alongside drummers Trucks and Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson; the general pattern is that Trucks is the timekeeper, Johanson adds colors, and Quiñones establishes rhythms that the guitarists can play against.
When the Allman Brothers Band are not active, Quiñones plays with various salsa bands and works as a session musician for albums (such as Marc Anthony's 2001 Libre), and creating music scores for television soundtracks, and commercials.
In September 2013, Quiñones married longtime girlfriend Nicole Wineland-Thomson. They reside in Massachusetts.

Born in Nashville, Michigan, Sessions died in a snowmobile racing accident in Alexandria, Minnesota.  He drove in the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1965-1975 seasons with 62 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 in 1968-1973 and 1975.  He finished in the top ten 21 times, with his best finish in 4th position on 7 occasions.
Based on information in "Donald Davidson's Indianapolis 500 Mile Race Annual 1974," Sessions was not given a chance to qualify for the 1974 Indy 500.  Because of the "fuel crisis," Qualifications were cut to two days in 1974.  May 11 was a short day of qualifying due to weather; on May 18 qualifications began about 15 minutes late due to administrative delays.  Sam Sessions was at the line with engine running on May 18 when 6PM arrived.  There were thirty-three cars in the field, but not everyone who entered in 1974 had a chance to qualify.
Sessions was also the 1972 USAC Sprint Car Series Champion.

[[Ghim Moh Bus Terminal]]
CATEGORIES: Bus stations in Singapore, Queenstown, Singapore

Ghim Moh Bus Terminal (Chinese: 锦茂巴士终站) is a bus terminal located in Ghim Moh along Ghim Moh Road with a small bus park behind the terminal. The terminal is now one of the few surviving terminals of the 1970s era in which it was common for terminals to be built along the roadside with only a small booth for bus captains to report to when completing their duties. The terminal allows boarding and alighting at a bus stop along the road and serves the residents of Buona Vista and Ghim Moh as well as those in the Mount Sinai housing estate.
With the upcoming Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme on the flats around this terminal, it is likely for this terminal to close down, and operations merged with the nearby Buona Vista Bus Terminal.

[[Chemical process modeling]]

CATEGORIES: Production and manufacturing software, Chemical process engineering, Process management

Chemical process modeling is a computer modeling technique used in chemical engineering process design. It typically involves using purpose-built software to define a system of interconnected components, which are then solved so that the steady-state or dynamic behavior of the system can be predicted. The system components and connections are represented as a Process Flow diagram.  Simulations can be as simple as the mixing of two substances in a tank, or as complex as an entire alumina refinery.
Chemical process modeling requires a knowledge of the properties of the chemicals involved in the simulation, as well as the physical properties and characteristics of the components of the system, such as tanks, pumps, pipes, pressure vessels, and so on.

The solutions to these unmet needs are then developed by designing and synthesizing engineered system specifications from medical, scientific, and engineering disciplines.  Furthermore, to develop these novel biomimetic microelectronic systems, our BMES ERC’s work  is concentrated in three thrust areas of enabling technology that are at the heart of immediate and long-term interest to the rapidly growing medical device industry.  
Areas of Research   
The three testbed areas are 1) Retinal Prosthesis (Restoring Vision to the blind) 2) Neuromuscular Prosthesis (reanimating paralyzed limbs) 3) Cortical Prosthesis (Repairing cognitive disability).  The three thrust areas are 1) mixed-signal systems on a chip, 2) power and data management, and 3) interface technology (electrode and electronic packaging technologies).
The Center has approximately 45 faculty that it works with at USC, Caltech and UC Santa Cruz, and an industrial advisory board of approximately ten companies.

Rufus Bernhard von KleinSmid (1875-July 9, 1964) was the Seventh President of the University of Arizona (1914–1921)[tpl]cite web|url=http://president.arizona.edu/president/rufus-bernard-von-kleinsmid|title=Rufus Bernard von KleinSmid|year=2013|work=Office of the President|publisher=University of Arizona|accessdate=12 April 2013[/tpl] and the Fifth President of the University of Southern California (1921–1947).About USC - History - von KleinSmid Era
Von KleinSmid started his academic career at DePauw University where he was a Professor of Education and Psychology.
Rufus Bernhard von KleinSmid became USC's fifth president in 1921. A high priority of his administration was to expand professional training programs, and President von KleinSmid also presided over a building program that added nine major structures to the university campus. By the end of his first decade in office, USC had attained full national accreditation, established a graduate school to unify graduate work across the university, and had become a large non-denominational institution.
With the onset of the Great Depression at decade’s end, USC was forced to retrench in the 1930s. During World War II (1939–1945), army barracks were constructed on campus, and the curriculum reflected a wartime emphasis on international relations, history, geography, languages, science and the like. Some 2,000 military trainees added to crowded conditions on campus. After the war, the lack of space at USC grew even worse, as the G.I. Bill brought former servicemen to the university for study. Enrollment soared from 8,500 in 1945 to more than 24,000 in 1947. In 1946 von KleinSmid, then 70 years old, elected to step down and became USC's chancellor for life.
He was recognized as "one of three of the nation's most distinguished citizens" through the National Institute of Social Sciences Gold Medal Award. On an international level, von KleinSmid received awards from 20 national governments for his achievements.VKC: A president's legacy - Lifestyle

The Thunder Swamp Trail System is a [tpl]convert|45|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] network of hiking trails in Pennsylvania. It was constructed by the Youth Conservation Corps during the 1970s through the Pocono Mountains. The trail surface is challenging and is often wet, uneven and rocky.
The main trail is marked with orange blazes and is designated a "State Forest Hiking Trail" with special trail corridor protection. There are several connector trails offering side trips.  Parking is very convenient for one of the better sections of this trail system and is located on the right-hand side of Rt.402 approximately one mile passed the Monroe/Pike County line.  The stone parking lot is located between Howeytown Road to the south and Saw Creek Road to the north.  This is a great section for trout fishing.  You can hike out of the back of the parking lot for approximately 1.5 miles and come across a small creek with nice six to eight inch trout scattered throughout the holes.  If you were to hike across Rt 402 for approximately three miles you will come across Ressica Creek which is always plentiful of trout.  This is a tough hike back to either stream but the experience is well worth the effort.  Hiking conditions are moderate at best, wear very comfortable and sturdy boots, pack plenty of water, and always take your camera.  The wildlife on these trails is great for the area.

[[Juno Awards of 1994]]
CATEGORIES: Juno Awards by year, 1994 music awards, 1994 in Canadian music

The Juno Awards of 1994, representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 20 March 1994 in Toronto at a ceremony in the O'Keefe Centre. Roch Voisine was the host for the ceremonies, which were taped that afternoon for broadcast that evening on CBC Television.
Nominations were announced 8 February 1994. Starting in 1994, the Best New Solo Artist combined the former Most Promising Male and Female Vocalist categories. Reggae also received its own category, after years of being included under banners such as "world beat" or mixed with calypso.
A new category for aboriginal music was also introduced and was awarded by Robbie Robertson. Nominee Sazacha Red Sky generated controversy over her recording of a prayer song her adopted brother Leonard George claimed was used by the family of Chief Dan George. Leonard objected to the song's recording by Red Sky aka Nancy Nash on the Peter Gzowski radio show.Red Sky is a former Vancouver resident who is many ancestries including First Nations. She is adopted into four First Nations families including Salish, Haida, Okanagan and Cherokee. Juno regulations for the aboriginal category required that the music, rather than the artists, be of native content or origin. Grand Chief Slaholt also brother to Dan George confirmed the song Red Sky recorded was not from his nation or a song of his brothers. This origin of this song is Tibetan and since 1995 was listed with Socan as Public Domain.
Around the time of the 1994 ceremonies, there were plans to host the 1995 ceremonies in Winnipeg. However, Juno organisers CARAS was demanding substantial funding from the Winnipeg committee attempting to host the awards.
Atlantic group The Rankin Family was the major winner in 1994, winning awards in four categories including Entertainer of the Year.

CATEGORIES: 2002 singles, Eurovision songs of Cyprus, Eurovision songs of 2002, One (band) songs

"Gimme" was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 by the boy band One, performed in English and is the first occasion that the Cypriot entry did not featured Greek lyrics. The song is a boyband number, with a girl being asked to give a sign that she loves the singers.
The song was performed first on the night, followed by the United Kingdom's Jessica Garlick with "Come Back". At the close of voting, it had received 85 points, placing 6th in a field of 24.
A few seconds after the lead singer Constantinos Christoforou began singing, a technical hitch led to a caption bearing the words 'Ugly Duckling' on the background video screen. Fortunately the picture of the stage was quickly brought back.
One member of the band (Constantinos Christoforou) had already participated for Cyprus at the Eurovision Song Contest 1996 with the song Mono Yia Mas. He would later make a further solo appearance at the 2005 Contest with "Ela Ela (Come Baby)" after the band formally disbanded. Therefore the song represents the middle leg in a rare sequence of a Eurovision contestant performing solo, then as a member of a vocal group, before a second solo performance.

He was the son of Thomas III of Piedmont and Guyonne de Châlon.
Philip's first marriage was celebrated in Rome on February 12, 1301 to Isabella of Villehardouin, Princess of Achaea. By that marriage, he became Prince of Achaea, though he had already been lord of Piedmont by inheritance from his father in 1282. As prince, Philip ventured to reconquer all of Lacedaemonia from the Greeks. He was, however, an authoritative prince and this put him at odds with the baronage of his realm. He tried to placate the barons of Morea, but was forced to accept a parliament in 1304. The Greek peasantry, crushed by taxes, then revolted in turn. In 1307, King Charles II of Naples, the suzerain of Achaea, confiscated the principality and gave it to his son, Prince Philip I of Taranto.
In 1312, Philip married Catherine de la Tour du Pin (died 1337) and had issue:

KLM Flight 607-E, also known as Hugo de Groot, registration PH-LKM, was an international scheduled flight operated by a Lockheed Super Constellation that crashed [tpl]convert|180|km[/tpl] west of Shannon, County Clare on August 14, 1958. All of the ninety-one passengers and eight crew died in the accident, including six members of the Egyptian fencing team.http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061012/news_1s12crshlist.html The "E" in the flight number stood for the designation of being an extra economy class flight to match the increased seasonal tourist demand."Tragedy for Homeward-Bound Vacationers." LIFE. Time Inc. August 25, 1958. Volume 45, No. 8. Page 28. ISSN 0024-3019. Accessed on Google Books. Retrieved on November 6, 2009.
Flight 607-E departed Shannon at 3:05 GMT on the second leg of a transatlantic trip from Amsterdam to New York City with intermediate stops in Shannon and Gander, Newfoundland. Radio contact with the aircraft was lost at approximately 3:40 GMT; a rescue operation was launched which found light debris on the surface of the ocean approximately 180 km west of Shannon. The remains of 34 of those on board were also recovered.
Due to the lack of evidence, Irish and Dutch investigators could not pinpoint a probable cause for the accident. They examined the possibility of a bomb, electrical failure or pilot error, but believed that the most likely possibility was a catastrophic mechanical failure. The cause of the accident is believed to be a malfunctioning overspeeding outboard propeller caused by metal particles obstructing oil feed line regulator valves.  The particles may have been formed by a gear that was damaged when the supercharger of the corresponding engine was accelerated (gear ratio shifted). The malfunctions of the propeller pitch might have provoked a flight disturbance and as a consequence the propeller may have sheared off.

Their family initially refused to cooperate with police in the homicide investigation into the children's deaths. The father, 21-year-old, Christopher Sonny Kahui was charged with their murder.

"Stronger Every Minute" was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, written by Mike Connaris and performed in English by Lisa Andreas. The song was finished 5th in the final.
As Cyprus had not finished in the top ten at the 2003 Contest, the song was performed for the first time in the semi-final. Here, it was performed fourteenth (following Albania's Anjeza Shahini with "The Image Of You" and preceding Macedonia's Toše Proeski with "Life"). It received 149 points to place 5th in the 22-song semi-final and qualify for the final.
In the final, it was performed twenty-first (following the United Kingdom's James Fox with "Hold On To Our Love" and preceding Turkey's Athena with "For Real"). At the close of voting, it had received 170 points, also placing equal 5th (this time in a field of 24) and qualifying Cyprus for the final in the next Contest.
The song is a love ballad, in contrast to the pyrotechnics and dance routines typical of the Contest at the time of its performance. Andreas performed it on stage unaccompanied by any other singers or musicians, earning a comparison to Barbra Streisand by one broadcaster.
Lyrically, it is a confession to her lover that "my love grows stronger every minute".
It was succeeded as Cypriot representative at the 2005 Contest by Constantinos Christoforou with "Ela Ela (Come Baby)".

Operation High Dive (also known as Project High Dive) was a secret project carried out during the 1950s by the United States Air Force. It tested high-altitude parachutes using anthropomorphic dummies. The dummies went into a 200 rpm flat spin, which would be fatal to a human. Further investigations on this led to Project Excelsior. It may later have been confused with Project Mogul and thus helped form the account of the Roswell UFO Incident.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

The lordship, later principality of Piedmont (Italian: Piemonte, French: Piémont) was originally an appanage of the Savoyard county and as such its lords were members of the Savoy-Achaea branch of that illustrious house. The title was inherited by the elder branch of the dynasty in 1418, at about which time Savoy was elevated to ducal status and Piedmont to princely status. When the House of Savoy was given the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Savoyard's used the style of Prince of Piedmont for their heir apparent. This first came into use by Prince Victor Amadeus of Savoy. 
The usage was retained when the House of Savoy became Kings of Italy, "Prince of Piedmont" becoming roughly equivalent to the British "Prince of Wales".

CATEGORIES: 2005 singles, Constantinos Christoforou songs, Eurovision songs of Cyprus, Eurovision songs of 2005

"Ela Ela (Come Baby)" (Greek: Ελα Ελα) was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, performed in English by Constantinos Christoforou.
As Cyprus had finished in the top ten in the previous year's Contest, the song was already qualified for the final. It was thus performed ninth on the night (following Albania's Ledina Çelo with "Tomorrow I Go" and preceding Spain's Son de Sol with "Brujería"). At the close of voting, it had received 46 points, placing 18th in a field of 24 and returning Cyprus to the semi-final at their next Contest appearance.
The song is an up-tempo number, with Christoforou urging his lover to "come baby, come baby".
Christoforou had previously appeared at the 1996 Contest singing "Mono Yia Mas" solo, as well as taking part as a member of One with "Gimme" at the 2002 Contest. With this performance, he became the most prolific contestant to appear purely for Cyprus (Anna Vissi having two appearances for Greece in addition to her sole appearance for Cyprus. Additionally, the performance represented the third "leg" in the rare sequence of a solo performance, followed by one as a group member and followed again by a solo performance.
The studio version of the song features prominent backing vocals by Elena Patroklou who was also featured in the music video. However, she withdrew due to personal reasons, and the live performance at the Eurovision Song Contest therefore featured Elina Constantopoulou instead. Ironically, both women had previously taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest; Elena Patroklou for Cyprus in 1991 and Elina Constantopoulou for Greece in 1995.
It was succeeded as Cypriot representative at the 2006 Contest by Annette Artani with "Why Angels Cry".

The name 'Patnitop' is a distortion of the original name of the place, "Patan Da Talab" meaning "Pond of the Princess". In olden times a pond existed in the meadows and a certain princess often used to bathe there. Some part of the pond still exists near the local youth hostel. It may be the case that the British had difficulties recording the Indian name correctly in their revenue records. Hence, over the years the name has changed from "Patan Da Talab" to Patnitop.

Carl Olof (Olle) Hedberg (May 31, 1899, Norrköping, Sweden – September 20, 1974, Verveln, Östergötland, Sweden) was a Swedish author. 
Hedberg is best known as a probing satirist of the middle class and conventional world in general. His first novel, Rymmare och fasttagare (Prisoner's base), was published in 1930, and from then on would write a novel every year for the next several decades. His works of the 1940s entail a search for religious and moral values.(April 1, 1995). Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature. Merriam-Webster. ISBN 0-87779-042-6. Page 528. Bekänna färg (Show one’s hand), published in 1947, is considered to be one of his most important novels from this period. 
His works do not aspire to a philosophical greatness.  Rather he himself is more of a realist and a disenchanted moralist.Seymour-Smith, Martin (1973). Funk & Wagnalls Guide to Modern World Literature. Funk & Wagnalls. ISBN 0-308-10079-4. Page 1025. He was a member of the Swedish Academy from 1957.
Hedberg committed suicide 1974, a few weeks after his daughter Birgitta succumbed to a sudden illness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bonnierforlagen.se/Forlag/Forfattare/?personId=31363|title=Olle Hedberg|publisher=Bonnierförlagen|accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl]

A wildland fire engine is a fire engine specifically designed to assist in fighting wildfires by transporting firefighters to the scene and providing them with access to the fire, along with water or other equipment. Most commonly used by the United States Forest Service, there are multiple types of wildfire apparatus which are used in different scenarios. According to the National Fire Protection Association, if the apparatus will be used primarily for outdoor and wildland responses, than it is to be considered a wildland fire apparatus and must conform to NFPA 1906.[tpl]cite web|last=David|first=Haston|title=NFPA 1906 and Wildland  Apparatus Design|url=http://www.fdsoa.org/2011_apparatus_symposium/NFPA%201906%20Update%20Urban-Rural-New%20Wildland.pdf|publisher=US Forest Service|accessdate=6 January 2014[/tpl]
Depending on where the engine is stationed it may carry as much as twice the national standard in fire hose. In areas where there is rugged terrain that keeps engines from driving directly to the fire, large hose lays are installed to transport water to the fire area. In desert areas with moderate terrain, less hose is used as it is easier to access the fire.[tpl]cite book|title=Engine Boss, S-231|year=2004|publisher=NWCG[/tpl] Often the technique of pump-and-roll is used where the vehicle drives with the pump engaged while a firefighter uses a hose to spray water on the fire.

The Mossi Kingdoms, sometimes mistakenly referred to as the Mossi Empire, were a number of different powerful kingdoms in modern-day Burkina Faso which dominated the region of the upper Volta river for hundreds of years.  The kingdoms were founded when warriors from the Dagomba area, in modern-day Ghana moved into the area and intermarried with local people.  Centralization of the political and military powers of the kingdoms begin in the 1200s and led to conflicts between the Mossi kingdoms and many of the other powerful states in the region.  In 1896, the French took over the kingdoms and created the French Upper Volta which largely used the Mossi administrative structure for many decades in governing the colony.

[[Tanktics (1999 video game)]]

CATEGORIES: 1999 video games, Real-time strategy video games, Video games developed in the United Kingdom, Windows games

Tanktics was a game developed by DMA Design in 1999 for the PC. It was published by Interplay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/tanktics/review.html?sid=2533353|title=Gamespot information for Tanktics|publisher=gamespot.com|accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]
The objective of the game is to progress through four time periods, building and controlling tanks from that period to fight the "evil black tanks" from a more advanced period. Notably, tanks are constructed by hand out of parts, which are randomly constructed by a factory (the "Part-o-Matic") in the player's base when it is provided with resources. Different parts may offer the ability to cross different terrain, offensive capabilities more suitable to current tactics, and so forth. The player's primary control is "the crane", a flying magnet (held by, for example, a pterodactyl in the first, ancient time period) which can pick up and drop single parts. A suitable pile of parts becomes a tank, which can be selected and ordered to move by the magnet.
The game also has a strong puzzle bias. The magnet can also pick up boulders (e.g. for blocking off enemy routes) and sheep (which can be used to increase the factory's production rate, amongst other things), and there are various terrain types with lasting effects. For example, driving a tank through mud will make it dirty, causing them to move more slowly until you wash them. Some maps have buttons on them which can only be activated by tanks with sufficient combat experience, and it can take considerable foresight to ensure that a tank will be able to survive to that level and be able to reach the button. Dissassembling a tank will make it lose all experience.
The game is very micromanagement heavy, requiring the player to spread one's attention thinly over maintaining the continually tiring sheep at the factory, tank battles, negotiation of terrain hazards such as quicksand, and tank construction. The metaphor of the 'cursor' being a flying magnet with a physical presence in the world can make moving the viewpoint between all these tasks troublesome.

The Andrea Doria'' class''', which Italians usually call the Caio Duilio class', was a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) during the early 1910s. The two ships—Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio—were completed during World War I. The Andrea Doria class was an incremental improvement over the preceding [tpl]sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|4[/tpl]. Like the earlier ships, Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio were armed with a main battery of thirteen [tpl]convert|305|mm|adj=on|sp=us[/tpl] guns.
The two ships spent World War I based in southern Italy to keep the Austro-Hungarian Navy bottled up in the Adriatic, but neither vessel saw any combat during the war. After the war, they cruised the Mediterranean and participated in several international incidents including the Corfu incident in 1923. Both ships were withdrawn from service in 1933 and began a lengthy reconstruction in 1937. The modifications included removing their center main battery turret and boring out the rest of the guns to [tpl]convert|320|mm|abbr=on|1[/tpl], strengthening their armor protection, installing new boilers and steam turbines, and lengthening their hulls. The reconstruction work lasted until 1940, by which time Italy was already engaged in World War II.
The two ships were moored in Taranto on the night of 11–12 November 1940 when the British launched a carrier strike on the fleet there. In the resulting Battle of Taranto, Caio Duilio was hit by a torpedo and forced to beach to avoid sinking. Andrea Doria was undamaged in the raid—repairs for Caio Duilio lasted until May 1941. Both ships escorted convoys to North Africa in late 1941, including Operation M42, where Andrea Doria saw action at the inconclusive First Battle of Sirte on 17 December. Fuel shortages curtailed further activity in 1942 and 1943, and both ships were interned at Malta following Italy's surrender in September 1943. Italy was permitted to retain both battleships after the war, and they alternated as fleet flagship until the early 1950s, when they were removed from active service. Both ships were scrapped after 1956.

[[Pulay Stress]]
CATEGORIES: Density functional theory

The Pulay Stress (named for Peter Pulay) is an error that occurs in the stress tensor when using density functional theory. It comes about when trying to relax the volume of a crystal using a constant basis set.
A simple example would be, if you ran a density functional code on a specified volume to get the ground state energy. This will get you set of plane waves that all have energies below the specified energy cutoff. Now, I want to change the volume but keep a constant number of plane waves for this new calculation. So if I increase the volume, then the reciprocal lattice vectors will shrink in size. This is because the reciprocal lattice vector is inversely proportional to the direct lattice vector. That means the energy cutoff will now decrease in different directions. Now our energy sphere for the cutoff energy will look more like an ellipsoid for our new volume with a new energy cutoff. This odd shaped energy cutoff will give a different ground state energy if the density functional code is run again using a spherical cutoff energy.
This error due to changing the volume but keeping the same plane waves can be seen in the stress tensor. The diagonal elements of the stress tensor are changed by a constant amount. So the Pulay stress is isotropic and has the effect to decrease the real fully relaxed volume.
One way to remove the Pulay stress is to start with a much larger energy cutoff than the default, recommended is 30% larger. Another way of relaxing the volume without getting Pulay stress is to relax it with a constant energy cutoff. This means keeping the energy cutoff constant and not the number of plane waves.

[tpl]Other uses|Market Street (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Market Street[/tpl]

Market Street, originally known as High Street, is a major east–west street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For part of its length, it serves as Pennsylvania Route 3.
The High Street was the familiar name of the principal street in nearly every English town at the time Philadelphia was founded. But if Philadelphia was indebted to England for the name of High Street, nearly every American town is, in turn, indebted to Philadelphia for its Market Street. Long before the city was laid out or settled, Philadelphia's founder, William Penn, had planned that markets would be held regularly on the [tpl]Convert|100|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wide High Street. The city's first market stalls were situated in the center of the thoroughfare starting at Front Street and proceeding west eventually to 8th Street. The stalls soon became covered and were not taken down as planned. Later, additional covered sheds appeared west of Center Square as the city expanded westward. The street began to be called Market Street around 1800. The road's new name was made official by an ordinance of 1858, ironically, just a year before the market sheds were ordered removed.
Market Street has been called the most historic highway in America because of the various historic sites along its eastern section. Many of Benjamin Franklin's activities were centered along Market Street. His house was located near the intersection of Fourth Street, and it is said that he may have performed his famous kite-flying experiment near Tenth and Market Streets.[tpl]Fact|date=August 2012[/tpl] Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in a boarding house (the Graff or Declaration House) once located at the Seventh Street intersection. The mansion of Robert Morris, financier of the American Revolution, was located near Sixth and Market Streets. This house was used by George Washington and John Adams as their residences during their time as President in Philadelphia. (The house was more or less on the site of the northern part of the modernday Liberty Bell Center.) Around 1795 Theophile Cazenove lived at Market Street.Full text of "Cazenove journal, 1794 : a record of the journey of Theophile Cazenove through New Jersey and Pennsylvania" Several important finance and publishing firsts also occurred along Market Street between Second and Fourth Streets during the 18th century. Market Street is still one of the principal locations of business and commerce in Philadelphia.

Poverty in India is widespread, with the nation estimated to have a third of the world's poor.

According to a 2011 poverty Development Goals Report, as many as 320 million people in India and China are expected to come out of extreme poverty in the next four years, with India's poverty rate projected to drop from 51% in 1990 to about 22% in 2015.[tpl]cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/9152344.cms |title=India's poverty will fall from 51% to 22% by 2015: UN report – Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011[/tpl] The report also indicates that in Southern Asia, only India is on track to cut poverty by half by the 2015 target date.
Defining the poverty line is itself a subjective matter, and many feel that it should be raised further. Indian journalist Ravi S Jha Ravi S Jha, "Redefining poverty: what does it mean to be poor in India?", The Guardian, 23 August 2013 suggests measuring poverty by segregating India's poor in different groups; those living in abject poverty, those who are vulnerable to poverty and those who are lifted out of poverty through government welfare. The urban areas where India’s middle and upper classes make their living have seen the greatest degree of economic growth, while the rural areas have lagged further behind. Since 1991, India has undergone a great deal of liberalisation internally and externally, but its benefits have mostly gone to the middle and upper classes.
The latest UNICEF data shows that one in three malnourished children worldwide are found in India, whilst 42% of the nation's children under five years of age are underweight. It also shows that a total of 58% of children under five surveyed were stunted. Rohini Mukherjee, of the Naadi foundation – one of the NGOs that published the report – stated India is "doing worse than sub-Saharan Africa."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j9SLwOtMSF1-32cS1MGtNRs9YPPA?docId=CNG.7cbdd5e68a3767b04a77f6d5083fdf35.101 |title=AFP: India's malnutrition 'a national shame', says PM |publisher=Google.com |date=10 January 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012[/tpl] However, the main cause for this malnourishment is dietary practices, and not economic poverty. To quote the same Rohini Mukherjee "It is very clear that in Africa (malnutrition) is a result of absolute poverty. They are starving... In our case, to me it seems it is about eating and feeding practices... Most children we measured have never been hungry, but what the child is eating is almost all carbohydrate." Too many women underestimate the need to breastfeed an infant during its first six months. People often consider Colostrum—a vital high-protein milk-form produced just before birth—as being impure and discard it.
The 2011 Global Hunger Index (GHI) Report places India amongst the three countries where the GHI between 1996 and 2011 went up from 22.9 to 23.7, while 78 out of the 81 developing countries studied, including Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Kenya, Nigeria, Myanmar, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Malawi, succeeded in improving hunger conditions.[tpl]cite web |title=2011 Global Hunger Index Report|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi11.pdf |date= |publisher= International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) [/tpl]

While staying at the Hop-On-Inn, the Bundys discover a secretly recorded video tape of the Rhoades having sex. Despite this, the Bundys decide to have sex and end up having themselves recorded as well.

Martinotti cells are small multipolar neurons with short branching dendrites.  They are scattered throughout various layers of the cerebral cortex, sending their axons up to the cortical layer I where they form axonal arborization. The arbors transgress multiple columns in layer VI and make contacts with the distal tuft dendrites of pyramidal cells.

[[International Academic Friends of Israel]]

CATEGORIES: Non-governmental organizations involved in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Zionist organizations, Israel friendship associations

The International Academic Friends of Israel (IAFI) is a non-profit organization of leading academics and scientists set up to support the free and open exchange of ideas within the international academic community,, and to ensure that Israeli academics are not excluded from that exchange.  It is registered as a non-profit organization in the United States and it maintains offices in New York City and Jerusalem, Israel.International Academic Friends of Israel Brochure, access July 5, 2006
The worldwide network of academics and scientists was founded in 2003 by Dr. Andrew Marks, Chairman and Professor of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, and editor in chief of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, as a result of proposals raised within most prominent academic communities, notably in England, South Africa, United States, Canada, Australia, and even Israel to boycott Israeli academics; proposals that supporters and opponents maintain are either a legitimate response to the Israeli-Arab conflict or an example of what some have described as "new anti-Semitism."
The purpose of the organization is to raise funds to support academic and scientific conferences in Israel, promote networking opportunities for young Israeli researchers now denied such contacts, and publicize Israel's scientific and academic achievements around the world. The group regularly participates in the The Global Forum Against Anti-Semitism, for which it has been thanked by Israeli Minister for Jerusalem & Diaspora Affairs, Natan Sharansky, for helping address “the threat of anti-Semitism which has returned with such dreadful force around the globe requiring our urgent, concentrated and coordinated response.” The group has also worked with American Jewish Congress to “thwart efforts to isolate Israel's academic experts in the fields of medicine, medical technology, high-tech, and biotech.”

[[The Log of the Ark]]
CATEGORIES: 1923 books, Constable & Co. books

The Log of the Ark is a children's book written by Kenneth Walker and Geoffrey Boumphrey.  It was first published by Constable & Co., London, 1923.  It was first published in the U.S.A. by E.P. Dutton & Co., New York, 1926 under the title What Happened in the Ark.    One of the many editions was by Puffin Books in 1963.
The book's plot describes the way in which an outcast animal, the scub, infiltrates the ark and introduces certain of the other species to the idea of eating meat. (Until this point, all the animals eat porridge with a dollop of treacle.) This sinister development is described alongside a good deal of slapstick humour.  For example the nautically naive Noah initially constructs the ark with all the large animals quartered together for social reasons, only discovering the consequences for its stability when the flood waters surround it.
Like many later fictionalisations of the Noah story, from Gary Larson to Julian Barnes, it introduces mythical beasts such as the unicorn into the Ark's passenger list, a device with obvious dramatic potential: we assume that such creatures are unlikely to survive the voyage. Here, as elsewhere, the comic elements mask tragic ones to good effect. Especially memorable is the plight of the 'Seventy-sevenses', a pair of nondescript and painfully shy mammals who name themselves after the number of their cabin, and who eventually abandon the Ark on a small raft because the atmosphere on board has become too oppressive.  There was also an even sadder pair of animals "The Clidders" who melted when it began to rain!
Outwardly this is a de-theologised version of the story: God does not appear, and the purpose of the Flood is not mass drowning. Yet the way the scub creeps into the childish innocence of the Ark and subverts it still points to a narrative patterned by Christian concepts of the Fall. In the final scene, a horrified Noah - who has not yet realised quite what has happened on his ship - watches as the newly released animals chase and fly from one another, awakened to their new identities as hunters and hunted.

The Ivory Coast's only Rugby World Cup appearance was in 1995 when they were placed in Pool D with France, Scotland and Tonga.
Their appearance in the 1995 Rugby World Cup was fairly notorious and controversial. In the opening game against Scotland, the Ivory Coast lost by 89 points to nil, a result which led many to question the inclusion of "minor" teams in the tournament.

[[Poplar River (Manitoba)]]
CATEGORIES: Rivers of Manitoba

The Poplar River runs towards the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg, in Manitoba, Canada. This river, which flows west into Lake Winnipeg, has a watershed beginning near the Manitoba and Ontario border. The river is located in one of the last, large, and intact boreal forests in the world.
The Poplar River's Ojibwe name is Negginan meaning "my home." Poplar River lies near the Asatiwisipe River. It is a protected river with pristine forests and many undeveloped lakes and creeks along it. This watershed is the traditional land use area for Poplar River First Nation. The Ojibwe still use the land and waters for hunting, fishing, and gathering wild foods and medicines. The First Nation community has designated their traditional lands as a protected area with the support of Manitoba's government.
The river is a part of a proposed United Nations World Heritage Site to protect the large intact area of wilderness along Lake Winnipeg and in northwestern Ontario. This wilderness river is one of the few rivers in southern Canada that is still very pristine and clean, with little or no development along the shoreline and in the entire watershed. There are no major mines, roads, hydro, or logging areas in the region. The area provides an essential habitat for a segment of the threatened woodland caribou, and also protects habitat for the chestnut lamprey, a species of special concern. Numerous archaeological sites and pictographs exist, helping to demonstrate that the area has long been of special significance to First Nations.
The river is a popular destination for fishing, canoeing, ecotourism, and sightseeing.  The water is very warm in the summer and fall for swimming, unlike glacier and mountain fed waters.  There are many cliffs, rapids, and waterfalls along the river.  The area has woodland caribou, wolves, black bears, lynx, bobcats, and remote beaches.  Many species of birds nest in the region, including the bald eagle and the great grey owl.

Hemdale Film Corporation, known as Hemdale Communications after 1993, was an independent film production company and distributor founded in London in 1967 as the Hemdale Company by actor David Hemmings and his manager, John Daly. Hemdale was initially founded as a talent agency that helped launch the careers of such bands as Black Sabbath and Yes.http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800311381/bio John Daly biography - Yahoo Movies However, after Hemmings left the company in 1971, Daly purchased the rest of the company and refocused Hemdale as a film studio. Originally a producer and distributor of British films, Hemdale relocated to Hollywood in 1980.Thomas, Bob. "Independent filmmakers may produce over half of releases." Associated Press (October 23, 1986). Retrieved on April 1, 2011. Derek Gibson later joined the company. 
Among its most well-known films are The Terminator, The Return of the Living Dead, Hoosiers, Salvador, River's Edge, Platoon, and The Last Emperor; the latter two were back-to-back recipients of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Despite these critical and commercial successes, Hemdale followed these films up with a series of box office bombs and the company eventually declared bankruptcy."Hemdale Communications Inc. files a voluntary petition for bankruptcy". Business Wire (November 9, 2005). FindArticles.com. Retrieved on 28 Dec, 2010. 
In 1991, Eric Parkinson joined Hemdale as president of the company, eventually shutting down its production facilities and duties, and started acquiring and distributing films independently produced by other people.
In 1995, Hemdale shut its doors, shortly after it was announced that Daly and Gibson would leave the company.http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company-structures-ownership/7105716-1.html Hemdale Communications Inc. announces resignation of chairman John Daly and president Derek Gibson; March 6, 1995 The library was then incorporated into Consortium de Realisation, a French holding company set up to handle the rights to titles acquired by Credit Lyonnais Bank.
After the studio's closing, the Hemdale library was incorporated into the Orion Pictures output now owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, after MGM acquired the Consortium de Realisation library from PolyGram (ironically, Orion was the original distributor for many of Hemdale's films). One key exception is The Last Emperor, a Hemdale production originally issued by Columbia Pictures, but whose rights are now held by its producer, Jeremy Thomas. Most of the foreign productions Hemdale distributed have subsequently returned to their original owners (such as Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland, which producer Tokyo Movie Shinsha now controls worldwide).
In 1991, Hemdale created a collection of many video cassette titles released by Hemdale Home Video, which was formed by Parkinson, around the United States of America. In 1995, the video rights to some of Hemdale's higher-profile titles were licensed to LIVE Entertainment (now Lionsgate).
The company's last new credit was for the Virgin Games video game adaptation of The Terminator, which showed up on the game's start up screen as "Hemdale's The Terminator" in text on the scrolling logo, despite all box art calling it "The Terminator".

Michael Evlampievich Perchin ([tpl]lang-ru|Михаил Евлампьевич Перхин[/tpl]) (1860-1903) was born in Okulovskaya in Olonets Governorate (now Republic of Karelia) and died in St. Petersburg. He was one of the most important Fabergé workmasters along with Henrik Wigström. Perchin became the leading workmaster in the House of Fabergé in 1886 and supervised production of the eggs until his death in 1903. The eggs he was responsible for were marked with his initials.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/faberge_nav/fnav_level_2/4house_workshop_fabfrm.html|title=Treasures of the World - Europe|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-09-21[/tpl]
He worked initially as a journeyman in the workshop of Erik August Kollin. In 1884 he qualified as a master craftsman and his artistic potential must have been obvious to Fabergé who appointed him head workmaster in 1886. His workshop produced all types of objets de fantasie in gold, enamel and hard stones. 
All the important commissions of the time, including some of the Imperial Easter Eggs, the renowned "Fabergé eggs", were made in his workshop. His period as head Fabergé workmaster is generally acknowledged to be the most artistically innovative, with a huge range of styles from neo-Rococo to Renaissance.

[[Taurotragus]]
CATEGORIES: Bovines

Taurotragus is a genus of antelopes of the African savanna, which are commonly known as Elands. It contains two species: the Common Eland and the Giant Eland. 
Elands are the largest African antelopes. Males range in size from [tpl]convert|600|to|800|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] and may even reach a ton on rare occasions; females range from [tpl]convert|400|to|600|kg|abbr=on[/tpl].
The meat of the eland contains more protein than cattle meat and less fat, and eland milk has a very high calcium level. For this reason, eland have undergone selection for meat quality and milk quantity in the Askaniya-Nova Zoological Park in Ukraine.  However, domestication of the animal in Europe to take advantage of their nutritional value has thus far been unsuccessful.[tpl]cite book |first=Jared |last=Diamond |title=Guns, Germs and Steel |publisher=W.W.

[[Herbrandization]]

CATEGORIES: Logic, Normal forms (logic)

The Herbrandization of a logical formula (named after Jacques Herbrand) is a construction that is dual to the Skolemization of a formula.  Thoralf Skolem had considered the Skolemizations of formulas in prenex form as part of his proof of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem (Skolem 1920).  Herbrand worked with this dual notion of Herbrandization, generalized to apply to non-prenex formulas as well, in order to prove Herbrand's theorem (Herbrand 1930).
The resulting formula is not necessarily equivalent to the original one. As with Skolemization which only preserves satisfiability, Herbrandization being Skolemization's dual preserves validity: the resulting formula is valid if and only if the original one is.
To understand the significance of these constructions, see Herbrand's theorem or the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem.

Gilberts Corner is an unincorporated area at the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 15 in Loudoun County, Virginia to the east of Aldie.
There are no residences at this intersection, however, its name is attributed to the surrounding area. Gilberts Corner is named after the gas station/restaurant that sits at the northeast quadrant of the crossroads. It gained prominence in the 1920s when the Carolina Road (now Watson Road) was a toll road and U.S. Route 15 was extended south from Leesburg to U.S. Route 50. Due to increased traffic from toll evaders, U.S. Route 15 eventually was extended even further south. The gas station/restaurant closed in the 1980s and is now abandoned. Due to heavy traffic in the area, many commuters avoid the intersection altogether by going through Lenah and taking U.S. Route 15 south. The South Riding community approximately 5 miles to the east on U.S Route 50.

The 76-mm regimental gun M1943 (OB-25) (Russian: 76-мм полковая пушка обр. 1943 г. (ОБ-25)) was a Soviet infantry support gun developed in 1943 by M. Yu. Tsiryulnikov at the ordnance plant in Motovilikha. The gun used a modernized barrel from the 76 mm regimental gun M1927 and the carriage from the 45 mm anti-tank gun M1942 (M-42). The gun was intended for destruction of light field fortifications and openly placed personnel by direct fire. HEAT shells gave it limited anti-armor capabilities. 76.2-mm regimental guns M1943 completely replaced M1927 guns in production that year and were built until the end of the German-Soviet War. Soon after the end of the war the production ceased due to insufficient range and muzzle velocity.

James William Colborn (born May 22, 1946) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. The right-handed Colborn pitched for the Chicago Cubs ([tpl]mlby|1969[/tpl]-[tpl]mlby|1971[/tpl]), Milwaukee Brewers ([tpl]mlby|1972[/tpl]-[tpl]mlby|1976[/tpl]), Kansas City Royals ([tpl]mlby|1977[/tpl]-[tpl]mlby|1978[/tpl]) and Seattle Mariners (1978).
After graduating from Whittier College with a degree in sociology, Colborn studied for his masters degree at Edinburgh University in Scotland, where he also starred in basketball as well as baseball, being named all-Scotland. He was planning on becoming a sociology professor until baseball lured him away. In [tpl]By|1966[/tpl], while in college, Colborn struck out 21 batters in a College All-Star Game in the Netherlands.
In [tpl]By|1967[/tpl], the Chicago Cubs signed Colborn as an amateur free agent. He found himself in Leo Durocher’s doghouse after struggling as a young relief pitcher for three years. At the end of the 1971 season, Colborn was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for José Cardenal.
[tpl]mlby|1973[/tpl] was Colborn’s best season; he became the Brewers' first-ever 20-game winner, posting a 20-12 record with a 3.18 ERA. He also was named to the American League All-Star team, but did not pitch in the game.
Over the next three seasons, however, Colborn posted losing records (10-13 in [tpl]mlby|1974[/tpl], 11-13 in [tpl]mlby|1975[/tpl] and 9-15 in 1976) before being traded, along with Darrell Porter, to the Kansas City Royals.

On May 14 of that year, Colborn no-hit the Texas Rangers 6-0, the first no-hitter by a Royal at Royals Stadium and second overall in that park, after the first of Nolan Ryan's seven career no-hitters (1973).
For eight seasons, Colborn was on Jim Tracy's staff as a pitching coach: from [tpl]mlby|2000[/tpl] to [tpl]mlby|2005[/tpl], when Tracy managed the Los Angeles Dodgers, and in [tpl]mlby|2006[/tpl] and [tpl]mlby|2007[/tpl], when Tracy managed the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Gordon J. "Pete" McCann (1908 – January 18, 2000) was a Canadian Thoroughbred horse trainer. He was born in East York, now part of the city of Toronto. Known to his family as Gordon, in racing circles he was nicknamed Pete.
Pete McCann began his career as a jockey. He raced at  Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba where he was a leading jockey in 1926. He rode with success in Toronto then in 1940 took out his trainer's license and won his first King's Plate that same year with Willie the Kid. 
McCann was hired by E. P. Taylor as head trainer at Windfields Farm in 1950 where he would spend the next twenty-one years. During his training career, McCann conditioned seven Canadian Hall of Fame horses and six horses that won Canadian Horse of the Year honors including Canadian Triple Crown winners New Providence in 1959 and Canebora in 1963. He also trained six winners of Canada's most prestigious race, the Queen's Plate and overall won seventeen races that now comprise the Canadian Classics. He also is tied for having trained the most winners with three in the Canadian International Stakes.
In 1971, McCann retired from training after Taylor divided the stable into Canadian and United States divisions under separate head trainers.  Quickly bored, he returned to racing with a small stable of his own.
McCann was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1979. He died of pneumonia at age 91.

Because of the Nikon body, it had a Nikon F lens mount and so could use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras.  It was autofocusing, had an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/2000 sec. and built-in exposure metering and pop-up flash.  Its ISO film speed equivalents ranged from 320-1600. 
The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S2 Pro in January 2002.
Aside from the Nikon lens mount, the camera's principal distinction was its unique (and controversial) 3.1 megapixel photo sensor.  Known as the Super CCD, it was unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other SLR cameras.  This allowed the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produced an output image equivalent to 6.2 megapixels.  The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lay somewhere between 3.1 megapixels and the 6.2 megapixel interpolated output.

The Fujifilm FinePix S2 Pro is an interchangeable lens digital single-lens reflex camera introduced in January 2002.[tpl]cite press release | url = http://www.fujifilmusa.com/JSP/fuji/epartners/PRNewsDetail.jsp?DBID=NEWS_625937 | title = Fujifilm's FinePix S2 Pro delivers exceptional high-resolution images, flexibility and convenience to the professional photographer | publisher = Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. | date = 2002-01-29[/tpl] It is based on a Nikon F80 (N80 in the U.S.) film camera body that was modified by Fujifilm to include its own proprietary image sensor and electronics. Because of the Nikon body, it has a Nikon AF lens mount and so can use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras. It is autofocusing, with an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/4000 sec., built-in exposure metering and pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 - 1600.  The S2 Pro also has sound recording capability. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro in February 2004.
Aside from the Nikon lens mount, the camera's principal distinction is its 6.17 megapixel photo sensor. Known as the Super CCD, it is unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras. This allows the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lies somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.1 megapixel interpolated output.
A huge number of these cameras were built using a Sony sourced defective CCD that was subject to a recall by Fuji.[tpl]fact|date=December 2012[/tpl] The recall ended when the stock of these replacement CCD's was depleted. There is word that no other stockpiles exist of this Super HAD CCD, making these cameras that are found with the purple or black tinted image problems extinct, only usable for parts. The Fuji F700 used a similar defective HAD CCD, but in 3.1/6.2Mp size. That camera has met a similar fate.

Each year, in May, the festival offers music, performances, arts, food, history and corporate outreach. The first festival in 1979 grew out of the civil rights movements of that era when President Jimmy Carter signed the proclamation to declare the first week in May to be Asian American Heritage Week. The proclamation was later extended to Asian American Heritage Month for the entire month of May. The festival has continued every year to celebrate the diverse cultures of Asian Americans and their contribution to American society.
In 2009, it will be held at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza on Sunday, May 3.

[[Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell]]

CATEGORIES: Babygrande Records albums, 2006 albums, Jedi Mind Tricks albums, Horrorcore albums

Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell is the fifth studio album by hip hop group Jedi Mind Tricks. It was released September 19, 2006 through Babygrande Records. The first single, "Heavy Metal Kings", featuring Ill Bill of La Coka Nostra, was released in early August through iTunes and a limited edition vinyl pressing. Additional guest appearances on the album are provided by Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond, Sean Price, R.A. the Rugged Man, Block McCloud and Army of the Pharaohs members Chief Kamachi and Reef the Lost Cauze.
As with previous Jedi Mind Tricks albums, many of the track titles appear to be lifted from previous songs by heavy metal groups.  For example, "When All Light Dies" was previously the title of a song by Trivium; "Serenity in Murder" is also the name of a Slayer track; "Razorblade Salvation" is also a song by Sinergy; and "Black Winter Day" is the name of a track by Amorphis. The album title, as well, could potentially be a reference to the Kreator track "Servant in Heaven (King in Hell)" from their Violent Revolution album. Much of the lyrics reference heavy metal also, i.e. "I'm a Cannibal Corpse" (When All Light Dies) and "Calculate infinity with The Dillinger Escape Plan." (Serenity In Murder).
Servants in Heaven became the group's most commercially successful release, being their first album to break into the Billboard 200, and also landed in the top ten on the Independent Albums chart, and the top fifty on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album was warmly received critically, especially when compared to their two previous efforts, Visions of Gandhi and Legacy of Blood, which both received mixed reviews. Allmusic gave the album a positive four star rating; writer Marisa Brown stated:
[tpl]quote|Like how Wu-Tang appealed to so many different fans because of both their hard, urban beats and their smart, complex lyrics, so too are Jedi Mind Tricks able to achieve that same status. Stoupe's production is heavy yet musical, and Paz's rhymes are intelligent yet accessible, his voice rough yet his delivery smooth. Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell is the collaboration of two talented musicians who can create a nearly flawless album in which each track can stand on its own, but is more powerful as a whole, as an exploration of pain and hatred, of those feelings that we often don't wish to address but that, thanks to Jedi Mind Tricks, will be addressed for us.allmusic ((( Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell > Overview )))[/tpl]
An exclusive version of the album was released at Trans World Entertainment chain stores. This version features three bonus tracks, a remixed version of "Heavy Metal Kings", performed with California hardcore band Terror, the D-Tension mixtape track "Pretty Little Whores", featuring Outerspace, and "Blitz Inc.", featuring King Syze and Esoteric, as well as a bonus DVD, featuring the "Heavy Metal Kings" music video.Babygrande News

Marie-Thérèse Levasseur, also known as Thérèse Le Vasseur and Thérèse Lavasseur, born 21 September 1721 in Orléans, died 17 July 1801 in Le Plessis-Belleville, was the domestic partner of Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
Thérèse Le Vassuer came from a respected family that had fallen on hard times; her father was a local official in Orléans, and her mother was a merchant. Thérèse and her mother moved to Paris to find work, and were later joined by her father.
Le Vasseur met Rousseau in Paris in 1745. Le Vasseur was working as a laundress and chambermaid at the Hotel Saint-Quentin in the rue des Cordiers, where Rousseau took his meals. She was 24 years old at the time, he was 33. According to Rousseau, Thérèse bore him five children, all of whom were given to the Enfants-Trouvés foundling home, the first in 1746 and the others in 1747, 1748, 1751, and 1752.
They went through a legally invalid marriage ceremony at Bourgoin on August 29, 1768. Therese provided Rousseau with support and care, and when he died, she was the sole inheritor of his belongings, including manuscripts and royalties.
After Rousseau's death in 1778, she married Jean-Henri Bally, a valet of René de Girardin, in November 1779. They lived together in Le Plessis-Belleville until her death in 1801.
Mount Lavasseur, Alaska, is named after her, for its proximity to  Rousseau Peak.

Messel is a municipality in the district of Darmstadt-Dieburg in Hesse near Frankfurt am Main in Germany.
The village is first mentioned, as Masilla, in the Lorsch codex.
Messel was the property of the lords of Groschlag from ca. 1400 to 1799. After the extinction of the Groschlag male lineage, the village would have passed to  the Archbishopric of Mainz but the population refused to accept this transition and paid homage to the daughters of the Groschlag family instead. The minister of the archbishopric, von Albini, consequently occupied the village with a force of 50 hussars. In 1806, the village fell to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.
The nearby Messel pit is an important site for Eocene fossils.

[[Snader Telescriptions]]

Snader Telescriptions, produced for television in 1951 and 1952, were film versions of popular and classical music performances. Singers, dancers, orchestras, and novelty acts appeared in the Snader musicals. They were produced by Louis D. Snader, a Southern California theater owner who branched out into television and then real estate.
In 1951, exotica musician and organist Korla Pandit left his KTLA show Adventures in Music to work with Snader, resulting in short films which gave Pandit a national TV audience. However, in 1953, problems with contract negotiations prompted Snader to replace Pandit with Liberace, which launched the pianist to fame. Pandit then hosted a show on KGO-TV in San Francisco.
The name "telescriptions" is a portmanteau of "television" and "transcriptions" (recordings intended for broadcast). Snader's three-minute films are similar to Soundies, miniature musicals filmed in the 1940s. Many telescriptions were later re-edited into television programs and feature films.

CATEGORIES: 1967 in Canada, 1967 sculptures, Monuments and memorials in Ottawa, Fountains in Canada, Ceremonial flames, Canadian Centennial

Located on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the Centennial Flame commemorates Canada’s 100th anniversary as a Confederation.Robert Bothwell, “Centennial Year,” The Canadian Encyclopedia (2012): (http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/centennial-year) The Flame was first lit as the climax of the centennial celebrations of January 1, 1967, in the presence of then Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. He was joined on the hill by leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, and Secretary of State, who was in charge of the Centennial, Judy LaMarsh as well as thousands of onlookers. The Flame is fuelled by natural gas and surrounded by a fountain whose ledge contains the shields of 12 of Canada’s provinces and territories—Nunavut is absent as it was not created until 1999.“Centennial Flame Change,” CTV News – CTV Television (2012): (http://search.proquest.com/docview/916268679?accountid=14789).   
This Centennial Flame was erected as a temporary monument, but due to great public support it still stands today.Pierre Berton, 1967 the Last Good Year (Toronto: Doubleday Canada ltd, 1997) 39-42.  It is located near the Queen's Gates (the centre gate), in front of the stairs leading to the Peace Tower and Centre Block.  The Centre Block is home to the House of Commons, the Senate and serves as an office building for MPs and Senators. The Centennial was celebrated across Canada in various ways; for example the re-enactment of the Battle of the Thames, the building of a destroyer out of match sticks, etc.  The government also encouraged the building of a Centennial memorial in each of Canada’s 10 provinces. The provincial and federal governments matched whatever the municipal government spent on their memorial, thereby encouraging the construction of grand buildings such as the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. 
The Centennial Flame is encompassed by a fountain into which many visitors to Parliament Hill throw coins for luck. That change is gathered, washed, dried and sorted by maintenance before it is put into a government bank account. From there the money is given to the winner of the Centennial Flame Research Award.“News Release: Centennial Flame Research Award for Persons with Disabilities,” Subcommittee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities (2005): accessed January 24, 2012. (http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=1585012&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=38&Ses=1) The award, which was begun in 2005, is given “to a person with a disability to enable him or her to conduct research and prepare a report on the contributions of one or more Canadians with disabilities to the public life of Canada or the activities of Parliament.”  The 2011 recipient, Andrew Morrison-Gurza, received $5,500.“News Release: 2011 Centennial Flame Research Award.” Subcommittee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities (2011): accessed January 24, 2012. (http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=5257752&Mode=1&Parl=41&Ses=1&Language=E) The 2012 recipient, Andrew St. Kitts, is a Masters student with cerebral palsy who plans on using the $5,000 he received to research “attitudes of able-bodied Canadians when they see people like him.”
Because of the fire that burns above the water, the fountain doesn't freeze, even in the middle of the winter.http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&stormfile=Where_do_coins_tossed_into_the_Centennial_Flame_go__02_12_2012?ref=ccbox_homepage_topstories
The flame is often confused with the Eternal Flame; however, it does not burn eternally. It may sometimes be extinguished due to bad weather or for maintenance purposes.Sheldon Alberts, “Centennial Flame Snuffed for Fear of Summit Vandals,” National Post (2002): (http://search.proquest.com/docview/330083905?accountid=14789).  In 2002, for example, during the G8 protest, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien made the decision to have the flame extinguished and the monument covered in order to avoid any damage.  It was covered by a welded steel lid attached to concrete.

Qimonda AG (pronounced "key-MON-da") was a memory company split out of Infineon Technologies (itself a spun off business unit of Siemens AG) on 1 May 2006, to form at the time the second largest DRAM company worldwide, according to the industry research firm Gartner Dataquest. It is now a patent licensing firm. Headquartered in Munich, Germany, Qimonda was a 300 mm manufacturer, and was one of the top suppliers of DRAM products for the PC and server markets. Infineon still controls a 77.5% stake, which it has written down (2008). Infineon was on record as having the aim of divesting itself of this stake, with the purpose of becoming a minority stakeholder in 2009. The company has issued 42 million ADR shares, each ADR share representing one ordinary share in Qimonda.
At its height in 2007, Qimonda employed approximately 13,500 personnel worldwide, from whom 1,800 were employed in R&D with access to four 300 mm manufacturing sites and operating six major R&D facilities, and included a chip packaging complex in Vila do Conde, Portugal, and its lead R&D center in Dresden, Germany, in total covering three continents. During this time, and on into September 2008, the price of DRAM continued to decline due to market oversupply, resulting in significant corporate financial losses throughout 2008.

A strobilus (plural: strobili) is a structure present on many land plant species consisting of sporangia-bearing structures densely aggregated along a stem. Strobili are often called cones, but many botanists restrict the use of the term cone to the woody seed strobili of conifers. Strobili are characterized by a central axis (anatomically a stem) surrounded by spirally arranged or decussate structures that may be modified leaves or modified stems.
Leaves that bear sporangia are called sporophylls, while sporangia-bearing stems are called sporangiophores.

[[Bandra Municipal Committee]]
CATEGORIES: History of Mumbai, Government of Mumbai, Bandra

The Bandra Municipal Committee was the governing body of the township of Bandra in suburban Mumbai (Bombay) 1876-1950. Initially concerned with the civic functions of Bandra, it expanded to include the suburb of Khar and Santra Cruz by 1933. In 1950, the municipality was merged with the Bombay Municipal Corporation under the Bombay Act No. VII of 1950.
The Municipality of Bandra established in 1876 had in 1880-81 an income of £1536 (Rs. 15,360) representing a taxation of 2s. 0½d. (Rs. 1-0-4) a head. This income chiefly comes from taxes on houses, boats, and roads. During 1880-81 the expenditure amounted to £844 (Rs. 8440), of which £239 (Rs. 2390) were spent on scavenging, £84 (RS. 840) on lighting, and £520 (Rs. 5200) on roads. The chief municipal works are new markets in Bandra and at Khar, representing a cost of £410 (Rs. 4104), and new roads representing a cost of £1169 (Rs. 11,690).Bandra markets were built from Local Funds in 1874 at. a cost of £443 (Rs. 4430), and handed over to the municipality who objected to pay the coat sum. The Bandra municipal district includes the following villages which lie either together or within half a mile of each other: Naupada, Khar, Pali, Varoda, Chimbai, Katvadi, Mala, Sherli Rajan, Chui, and Danda. Of public offices and institutions there are, besides the railway station, a post office, a dispensary, and seven schools. The Sir Kavasji Jahanghir Readymoney Dispensary was founded in 1851 at the request of several influential inhabitants of Salsette. Subscriptions seem to have accumulated as, in 1867, there was a balance of £1920 (Rs. 19,207). In 1874 Government sanctioned a yearly grant of £260 (Rs. 2600) to pay a medical officer and staff of servants. In 1877 Sir Kavasji Jahanghir handed over £1000 (Rs. 10,000) to Government who directed that the dispensary should be called by his name. The attendance in 1880-81 was 14,565 out-patients and five in-patients. One or two private dispensaries are also kept by Bombay practitioners, chiefly native Christians. Most of their patients belong to the middle and upper classes, and their fees vary from 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2- Rs. 3) a visit. Of the schools the Jesuits maintain the St. Stanislaus' Orphanage and St. Joseph's Convent, the former with 235 boys and the latter with 214 girls. The following schools are also kept by the native Christian clergy: a Diocesan School with an attendance of 170 pupils, a Portuguese Catechism School at Sherli with an attendance of 50, and St. Vincent's School at Pali with an attendance of 45. There are also two Government Anglo-vernacular schools, one at Bandra with 130 boys and 10 girls and one at Danda with 28 boys. The elementary education of native Christian children is fairly provided for, and as a rule they do not attend the Government schools

The 85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K) ([tpl]lang-ru|85-мм зенитная пушка обр. 1939 г. (52-К)[/tpl]) was an 85-mm Soviet air defense gun, developed under guidance of leading Soviet designers M. N. Loginov and G. D. Dorokhin. This gun was successfully used throughout the German-Soviet War against level bombers and other high- and medium-altitude targets. In emergencies they were utilized as powerful anti-tank weapons. The barrel of 52-K was the base for the family of 85-mm Soviet tank guns. Crews of 85-mm AD guns shot down 4,047 Axis aircraft. The mean quantity of 85-mm ammunition required to shoot down one enemy plane was 598 rounds. After the war some 52-Ks were refitted for peaceful purposes as anti-avalanche guns in a mountainous terrain.
Virtually every country behind the Iron Curtain received this gun after World War II for their air defense. In the Soviet Union itself, these guns were largely superseded by the 100 and 130 mm guns.

[[Kitman]]
CATEGORIES: Arabic words and phrases

Kitman (Arabic kitmān كتمان "secrecy, concealment") is the act of paying lip service to authority while holding personal opposition. It is a sort of political camouflage, for the purpose of survival, in circumstances where open opposition would result in persecution.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Czesław Miłosz in the The Captive Mind uses Ketman (a variation on Kitman) as a metaphor for understanding how intellectuals behaved under the totalitarian regimes in Postwar Communist Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Hungary.Czesław Miłosz, The Captive Mind, 1953, translated into English by Jane Zielonko.
Some early Muslim jurists such as Muadh bin Jabal were opposed to the concept altogether as they felt it implied “lying” (kidhb) and “hypocrisy” (nifaq). In modern times, it is understood that both Kitman and Taqiyya are both forms of altering or concealing information.
In the Ibadi denomination of Islam, the concept is considered an important one as the denomination's minority status and secretive nature drove many adherents to conceal their creed in order to survive.Uzi Rabi, The Emergence of States in a Tribal Society: Oman Under Saʻid Bin Taymur, 1932-1970, pg. 22.

Stern's choices for the title were I, Moron, Mein Kampf and Penis[tpl]cite web | last= Fink | first= Mitchell | title = The Insider | publisher = People Magazine, Vol. 40 | date= August 30, 1993 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20106152,00.html | accessdate = January 10, 2010[/tpl] (the last was considered as Stern thought it would lead to the amusing newspaper headline "Howard Stern's Penis is a bestseller") but were refused by the publisher, although Mein Kampf would be used as the title of the book's fifth chapter regarding the beginning of his career.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news01/5-7-01.htm |title=For The Week Of 5/7/2001 to 5/11/2001 |accessdate=2009-05-08 |last=Mercer |first=Mark |work=MarksFriggin.com |date=2001-05-11 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news07/12-3.htm |title=For the week of 12/03/2007 to 12/07/2007 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |last=Mercer |first=Mark |work=MarksFriggin.com |date=2001-05-11 [/tpl] They then compromised with the title Private Parts, suggested by Stern's co-host Robin Quivers,  which Stern liked as a sexual pun referring to the personal "private parts" of his life with a popular euphemism for genitalia.
The book received mixed reviews from critics, often drawing comparisons to Lenny Bruce's How to Talk Dirty and Influence People.

[[Friendly People]]

CATEGORIES: Guttermouth albums, Nitro Records albums, 1994 albums

Friendly People is the second album by the Huntington Beach, California punk rock band Guttermouth, released in 1994 by Nitro Records. It was the first release for the label, which was founded by Dexter Holland of The Offspring. The album continued the band's style of fast, abrasive punk rock with tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics.
The release of Friendly People gained Guttermouth supporting slots on national and world tours with bands such as The Offspring. During these tours the band developed a reputation for chaos and outrageous behavior, resulting in their being banned and blacklisted from several tours and venues. The most famous of these incidents included the band being banned for several years from performing in Canada on charges of public indecency due to onstage nudity in Saskatoon, and singer Mark Adkins' arrest for "assault with a deadly weapon" after using his onstage microphone to incite a near-riot during a show in San Bernardino.
Some early versions of the CD copy of the album contain technical errors. The songs are tracked out of order from their original listing, and the overall speed is slower making the recording sound like a slower mix. These inconsistencies are due to technical errors at the plant where the CDs were produced.

Ronald "J.J." Henry III (born April 2, 1975) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour.
Henry was born in Fairfield, Connecticut. While attending Texas Christian University, he was the individual runner up at the 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships and turned pro later that year. He joined the Nationwide Tour in 1999, and after winning the 2000 BUY.COM Knoxville Open moved up to the PGA Tour in 2001. His first PGA Tour win came in 2006 at the Buick Championship; he became the first Connecticut golfer to win the event. He played on the 2006 Ryder Cup team, halving all three matches he was involved in.
Henry came close at the 2012 Byron Nelson Championship where he had one-shot lead with two holes to play. A double bogey on the 71st hole resulted in him eventually finishing two strokes behind winner Jason Dufner. Later in the year, Henry won for the second time on the PGA Tour at the Reno–Tahoe Open. The event used the modified Stableford scoring system and Henry prevailed by one point over Brazilian Alexandre Rocha. He earned entry into the PGA Championship the following week.
Henry lives with his wife Lee and his two children in Fort Worth, Texas.

Crackle of Death is a 1976 film, the third produced in the Night Stalker film series. It combined the Kolchak: The Night Stalker episodes "Firefall" and "The Energy Eater" with additional narration by Darren McGavin as Kolchak. It also contains new dialogue by McGavin, Oakland and Grinnage, as well as new "scenes", such as a newspaper on a desk and the image of the Doppelganger being inserted into old footage (for example, when Kolchak looks at the sky, he sees the Doppelganger giant face).
Crackle of Death was followed by a fourth movie entitled Demon and The Mummy that combined two more episodes in a similar manner; namely, "Demon In Lace" and "Legacy of Terror".
All four episodes comprising these films were subsequently withdrawn from the original television syndication package. They were not made available in their entirety again until a Columbia House VHS video release in the 1990s. The TV-edited films have never been released on home video.

[[Andy Page (character)]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in short stories

Andy Page is a fictional character appearing in several well-known short stories written by popular Australian writer and poet Henry Lawson. Andy is rarely found without the company of good mates Jim Bently and Dave Regan, and is generally the 'straight man' of the trio.
Andy's character first appeared in Lawson's short story, "Andy Page's Rival." This story was published in Lawson's collection On The Track in 1900. 
"The Iron-Bark Chip," which includes the characters of Andy Page, Dave Regan, and Jack Bentley (most likely the character more commonly known as Jim Bently) was published in the same collection.
Possibly the most popular Andy Page story would be Lawson's humorous "The Loaded Dog", in which Dave's imaginative idea of fishing with explosives backfires when the cartridge is left unattended.
Andy, like Dave, is extremely fond of fishing. According to "The Loaded Dog," "Andy would fish for three hours at a stretch if encouraged by a ‘nibble’ or a ‘bite’ now and then— say once in twenty minutes." Whilst Dave thought up the idea for the explosive fishing cartridge, Andy implemented it. "Andy usually put Dave’s theories into practice if they were practicable, or bore the blame for the failure and the chaffing of his mates if they weren’t."[tpl]cn|date=June 2012[/tpl]

He scored nearly 13,000 runs for Derbyshire and achieved over 430 dismissals from behind the stumps.
Storer was born at Ripley, Derbyshire, the son of John Storer, an engine smith, and his wife Elizabeth. In 1881 the family were living at Butterley Hill and he was a turner's apprentice.British Census 1881
Storer was a specialist wicket keeper who was reputed to stand up to the wicket against fast bowlers. He was also a highly skilled batsman at a time when wicket-keeper batsmen were rare and twice averaged over fifty in a season.  His first-class record of 216 not out came against Leicestershire in the 1899 season and he was the first professional to score two hundreds, against a strong Yorkshire side, in a match.  He was also a competent leg spinner, taking 232 first class wickets at 33.89. Storer also appeared for London County.Bill Storer at Cricket Archive
Storer toured Australia for England, making his debut in the 1897 Test at Sydney and played against the tourists at home, his last Test coming at Trent Bridge in 1899 when he was also named a Wisden cricketer of the year.  His Test appearances were limited by the selectors preference for Dick Lilley.
Storer died in Derby at the age of 45. His brother Harry Storer also played cricket for Derbyshire and football for Derby County.

Norman Kay (August 11, 1927 – January 17, 2002) was an American bridge player. He partnered Sidney Silodor until Silodor's death in 1963. With Edgar Kaplan, Kay formed one of the most successful and longest-lasting partnerships in organized bridge.[tpl]cite book |last = The Bridge World - Jeff Rubens, Editor |first = |authorlink = |title = Bridge Master: The Best of Edgar Kaplan |edition = |publisher = Bridge World Books|location = New York |page = 9 |series = |year = 2004 |doi = |lccn = |oclc = |isbn = 0-9753419-0-1[/tpl][tpl]cite news | first=Alan| last=Truscott| title=Norman Kay, 74, a Bridge Champion Sans Title|date=2002-01-20 | publisher=The New York Times | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E7D6173BF933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | work =nytimes.com | accessdate =[/tpl] It spanned more than 40 years, and ended with Kaplan's death in 1997.
In 1955, Kay won the American Contract Bridge League's McKenney trophy (now called the Barry Crane Top 500) for most masterpoints won during the tournament year. Kay won 13 major North American Bridge Championships (NABC) in the period of 1957–1977, when he was named ACBL's top performance player. He was runner-up in the Bermuda Bowl twice (1961 and 1967), and was second (1968) and third (1960) in the World Team Olympiad. He was a World Bridge Federation World Life Master and an ACBL Grand Life Master. Kay was arguably the greatest bridge player who never became a world champion. He was known for both the remarkable accuracy of his card play and for his even temperament at the table. Away from the table, he was widely respected as an exceptionally kind and humble gentleman.
Kay was an account executive for Merrill Lynch for 38 years, retiring as a vice president in 1987. He helped his wife who operated a sports memorabilia business from 1980 to 1997. He and his wife, Judy, also owned a stable of standardbreds (trotters and pacers) from 1980 to 1987. Kay died from cancer on January 17, 2002.

CATEGORIES: English poems, 1865 poems, Works by John Henry Newman

The Dream of Gerontius is a poem written by John Henry Newman (February 21, 1801 – August 11, 1890) consisting of the prayer of a dying man, and angelic and demonic responses.
Newman said that the poem "was written by accident – and it was published by accident."  He wrote it up in fair copy from fifty-two scraps of paper between 17 January and 7 February 1865 and published it in May and June of the same year, in two parts in the Jesuit periodical The Month.Banfield, Stephen, "The Dream of Gerontius at 100: Elgar's Other Opera?", The Musical Times, Vol. 141, No. 1873 (Winter 2000), pp. 23–31 The poem inspired a choral work of the same name by Edward Elgar in 1900.
The poem was largely inspired by the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, a great allegorical depiction of Dante's travels through the realms of the dead.
Newman's character, too, dreams of the worlds that may await him after his death. He dreams that he is guided by an angel toward God, but then warned of the pain that may accompany the beatific vision: "For one moment thou shalt see thy Lord,/ One moment; but thou knowest not, my child,/ What thou dost ask; that sight of the Most Fair/ Will gladden thee, but it will pierce thee too."
With the protective presence of this angel, Gerontius passes safely by the demons who are looking to gather souls for hell.
But, as the angel had hinted, Gerontius' soul is pained by the sight of God, and he begs to be sent away, to spend time in purgatory.
He begs to be taken to the "lowest deep" until he is properly prepared to look at God, "and see Him in the truth of everlasting day."
The poem ends with the angel's assurance that that day will come, "Swiftly shall pass thy night of trial here, And I will come and wake thee on the morrow."

It was both Button and Brawn's first Championship success, Brawn becoming the first team to win the Constructors Championship in their debut season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8289217.stm |title=Brawn win title in debut F1 year|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2009-11-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091021043626/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8289217.stm| archivedate= 21 October 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Button was the tenth British driver to win the championship, and following Lewis Hamilton's success in 2008 it was the first time the Championship had been won by English drivers in consecutive seasons, and the first time since Graham Hill (1968) and Jackie Stewart (1969) that consecutive championships have been won by British drivers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12538_5637133,00.html|title=Great Button!|date=2009-10-18|work=Sky Sports|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|accessdate=2009-10-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091020032033/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12538_5637133,00.html| archivedate= 20 October 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Also notable was the success of Red Bull Racing, as well as the poor performance of McLaren and Ferrari compared to the previous season.
Ten teams participated in the Championship after several rule changes were implemented by the FIA to cut costs to try to minimise the effect of the global financial crisis. There were further changes to try to improve the on-track spectacle with the return of slick tyres, changes to aerodynamics and the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) presenting some of the biggest changes in Formula One regulations for several decades.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.planet-f1.com/story/0,18954,3213_4907252,00.html |title=Newey: Biggest rule changes since 1983 |publisher=planet-F1.com |date=2009-02-09| accessdate= 20 July 2010 [/tpl]
The Brawn team, formed as a result of a management buyout of the Honda team, won six of the first seven races, their ability to make the most of the new regulations being a deciding factor in the Championship. The Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari teams caught up in an unpredictable second half of the season, with the season being the first time since [tpl]f1|2005[/tpl] that all participating teams had scored World Championship points. Sebastian Vettel and Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello were his main challengers over the season, winning six races between them to finish in second and third respectively.

The Order of St Catherine ([tpl]lang-ru|Императорский Орден Святой Екатерины[/tpl]) was an award of Imperial Russia. 
Instituted on November 24, 1714 by Peter the Great on the occasion of his marriage to Catherine I of Russia. For the majority of the time of Imperial Russia, it was the only award for ladies** (the Order of Saint Olga existed briefly from 1916–1917, but ceased with the fall of the Romanov dynasty).
The statutes of the Order were first published in 1713, and the order was under the patronage of St. Catherine of Alexandria, the patron saint of the Empress. On the 24th of November 1714, on the Empress' name day, Peter the Great personally bestowed the insignia of the Order upon the Empress Catherine, creating her Grand Mistress of the Order. However, no further members were inducted until 1726.

Coelogyne nitida is a species of orchid in the Coelogyne genus. 
Coelogyne nitida is a cool-growing species originating in the Himalayan region of India and southeast Asia. It requires a decided rest period during winter during which it receives no feed, very little water (enough to prevent pseudobulbs shrivelling), cool to cold temperatures and high light. These conditions seem to aid flowering in spring for some growers, though others report that more constant conditions can also produce regular flowering.

[[Ankyrin repeat]]
CATEGORIES: Protein structural motifs

The ankyrin repeat is a 33-residue motif in proteins consisting of two alpha helices separated by loops, first discovered in signaling proteins in yeast Cdc10 and Drosophila Notch. Domains consisting of ankyrin repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and are among the most common structural motifs in known proteins. They appear in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic proteins, but are far more common in eukaryotes. Ankyrin repeat proteins, though absent in most viruses, are common among poxviruses. Most proteins that contain the motif have four to six repeats, although its namesake ankyrin contains 24, and the largest known number of repeats is 34, predicted in a protein expressed by Giardia lamblia.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mosavi L, Cammett T, Desrosiers D, Peng Z |title=The ankyrin repeat as molecular architecture for protein recognition |journal=Protein Sci |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1435–48 |year=2004 |pmid=15152081 |url=http://www.proteinscience.org/cgi/content/full/13/6/1435 |doi=10.1110/ps.03554604 |pmc=2279977[/tpl] 
Ankyrin repeats typically fold together to form a single, linear solenoid structure called ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are one of the most common protein–protein interaction platforms in nature. They occur in a large number of functionally diverse proteins, mainly from eukaryotes. The few known examples from prokaryotes and viruses may be the result of horizontal gene transfers.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bork P | title = Hundreds of ankyrin-like repeats in functionally diverse proteins: mobile modules that cross phyla horizontally? | journal = Proteins | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–74 |date=December 1993 | pmid = 8108379 | doi = 10.1002/prot.340170405 | url =  [/tpl] The repeat has been found in proteins of diverse function such as transcriptional initiators, cell cycle regulators, cytoskeletal, ion transporters, and signal transducers. The ankyrin fold appears to be defined by its structure rather than its function, since there is no specific sequence or structure that is universally recognised by it.

The Turkish army was led by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I who had conquered Egypt and it became part of the Ottoman Empire. The Ayyubid dynasty was put into power by the leadership of the Kurdish general Salah al-Din who was mentioned as Saladin in Europe. Saladin fought off the Crusaders at the gate of Fatimid Cairo, at this point Saladin had announced that the Fatimid dynasty had come to an end. After this, the Ayyubid dynasty was then established in 1171. During this period, there was still a lot of conflict between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders.

[[Abdoulaye Diakité]]
CATEGORIES: 1950 births, Living people, Bamana people, Tambacounda, Senegalese drummers

Abdoulaye Diakité (born December 5, 1950) is a djembe master drummer from Tambacounda, Senegal. He studied under djembe legend Suncaru Jara, and later became the lead djembe player of the National Ballet of Senegal for 18 years. 
Abdoulaye Diakite is a member of the Bamana ethnic group from Mali. The Bamana are a tribe of the Malinke (mainly in Mali and Senegal) who resisted modernization and missionary efforts. The word Bamana means "we won’t join" referring to their refusal to leave their heritage behind and remain true to their ancient beliefs and practices.
Diakite began drumming at the age of seven. Throughout his youth, Diakite was known for his natural ability on the djembe drum. For many years, he studied with his teacher Suncaru Jara in Tambacounda. 
At age 16, he played at a festival in Tambacounda that would forever change his life. The Ballet National du Senegal was there looking for a djembe player who sounded like the famous djembefola (djembe player) Dugufana Tarawele. There, they discovered Diakite. 
In 1969, Abdoulaye Diakite officially joined the Ballet National du Senegal. For the next 18 years until 1986, he traveled the world as their lead soloist. Upon the completion of his last world tour, Diakite chose to stay in the United States and make his home away from home in Oakland, California. 
In the early 1990s, Diakite founded Tambacounda Productions and co-founded the drum and dance company CEEDO, both located in Oakland. Under the Tambacounda Productions label, Diakite has initiated a variety of performances and conferences that educate the public on the music of West Africa. The biggest of these events includes the Tambacounda West African Drum and Dance Camp, which has been held annually in the Bay Area since 1996. The summer camp was the first of its kind and has arguably been an inspiration to the growth and popularity of West African drumming and dancing in the United States.

Mind on the Moon is an album by Canadian reggae musician Snow, released in 2000.  Despite being his fifth album, this was the first disc since his 1993 debut 12 Inches of Snow that Snow returned to the pop charts and received mainstream airplay on both radio and television.
The initial single "Everybody Wants To Be Like You" received the most radio play, but it was the second single, "The Plumb Song", that was on the heavier rotation on MuchMusic.  This was likely due to the music video which featured Snow play every role, with the different characters having interactions with each other. "Joke Thing" and "Nothin' On Me" were less successful singles off the album.

[[French legislative election, 1973]]

CATEGORIES: General elections in France, 1973 elections in France

French legislative elections took place on 4 and 11 March 1973 to elect the 5th National Assembly of the Fifth Republic.
In order to end the May 1968 crisis, President Charles de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and his party, the Gaullist Party Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR), obtained the absolute majority of the seats. Nevertheless, the failure of his 1969 referendum caused his resignation. His former Prime minister Georges Pompidou was elected President of France. 
In order to respond to the discontent expressed during May 1968, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, the left-wing Gaullist who led the cabinet, promoted a programme of reforms for the advent of a "New Society", which advocated social dialogue and political liberalisation. This worried the conservative part of the Presidential Majority and Pompidou himself. Furthermore, Chaban-Delmas was accused, by the presidential circle, to want strengthen his powers to the detriment of Pompidou. In 1972, Chaban-Delmas is replaced by Pierre Messmer, a classical and conservative Gaullist.
After Gaston Defferre's catastrophic result in the 1969 presidential election, the SFIO was replaced by the Socialist Party (PS), formed by the SFIO's merger with an array of political clubs on the democratic left. Two years later, François Mitterrand's Convention of Republican Institutions joined the PS. He took the party's lead during the Epinay Congress, and proposed to form an alliance with the French Communist Party (PCF). In order to prepare the legislative elections, Communists and Socialists signed the Common Programme. 
The Radical Party split over the question of the Common Programme.  The left-wing minority joined the "Union of Left" and founded the Movement of the Radical-Socialist Left (MGRS). The majority created the Reforming Movement with a part of the center-right. This new group claimed its independence towards the "Union of Left" and the Presidential Majority.
The Common Programme was the main issue of the campaign. Its defenders pleaded the necessity to nationalize banks and companies which were in a situation of monopoly. The members of the Presidential Majority denounced a collectivist project and warned against the participation of Communists in the government if the Left won. The Reforming Movement tried to express a third way rejecting the Marxism of the Left and the Euroscepticism of the Gaullists. But, it was obliged to link with the Right to obtain parliamentary seats. 
Whilst the left won an increased number of votes and MPs, the Presidential Majority won the election. The Gaullist UDR lost one third of its parliamentary seats due to the growth of the Left and electoral agreements with its allies, the Independent Republicans and Centre, Democracy and Progress. Messmer was confirmed as Prime Minister.

[[Wanna Be a Star]]

CATEGORIES: 1981 albums, Chilliwack (band) albums

Wanna Be a Star is the ninth album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack, released in 1981.  At this point, the band had collapsed into a trio, without a full-time drummer, but leader Bill Henderson and guitarist/keyboardist/drummer Brian MacLeod had become a powerful songwriting team during the interim.  The album track: "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)", became the group's first hit since the 1979 collapse of their former label Mushroom Records, reaching #1 in Canada and giving Chilliwack their U.S. Top 40 breakthrough peaking at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100: "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)" also gave Chilliwack their only evident chart item outside North America reaching #57 in Australia with a disproportionately long chart run of 28 weeks. The success of "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)" led to a touring version of Chilliwack re-forming. The album's second single: "I Believe", was also a Top 10 Canadian hit and returned Chilliwack to the U.S. Top 40 at #33.
Overall the album is something of a concept album about the "rock and roll" lifestyle and the pursuit of fame. The leadoff track "Sign Here" is a reference to Chilliwack's new quest for mainstream success, tempered by their brush with fame on Mushroom.  This was the first album they recorded with Solid Gold Records in Canada, a new Toronto-based label.

The National Union of Greece ([tpl]lang-el|Εθνική Ένωσις Ελλάδος[/tpl], Ethniki Enosis Ellados or EEE) was an anti-Semitic nationalist party established in Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1927.
Registered as a mutual aid society, the EEE was founded by Asia Minor refugee merchants. According to the organisation's constitution, only Christians could join. Its members were opposed to Thessaloniki's substantial Jewish population.
It was led by Georgios Kosmidis ([tpl]lang|el|Γιώργος Κοσμίδης[/tpl]), an illiterate Turkish-speaking traderMark Mazower, Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews, 1430-1950, London: HarperCollins, 2004, p. 413. ISBN 0-00-712023-0. and D. Charitopoulos ([tpl]lang|el|Δ. Χαριτόπουλος[/tpl]), a banking clerk.
The party's leaders were the main defendants in the trial held after the Campbell Riot of 29 June 1931, in which Greek nationalist mobs attacked the Jewish "Campbell" settlement in the city. (A co-defendant was Nikolaos Nikos Fardis ([tpl]lang|el|Νίκος Φαρδής[/tpl]), editor-in-chief of the Makedonia newspaper.)
Estimates put the party's strength at 7,000 members in 1932; by 1933, it had 3,000 members march to Athens, in apparent imitation of Benito Mussolini's 1922 March on Rome.[tpl]cite book | author = Victor Roudometof | title = Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict | publisher = Praeger/Greenwood | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-275-97648-3 | page = 115[/tpl] However, it polled miserably in the 1934 city elections in Thessaloniki, and in 1935, the party imploded as a result of in-fighting. It was revived by the German occupation authorities in 1942, during the Axis Occupation of Greece; many members of EEE became prominent collaborators of the Nazis, and many more joined the Security Battalions and helped in the identification of Greek Jews.
Owing to its paramilitary uniforms and organisation, the party was commonly referred to as "The Three Epsilons" ([tpl]lang|el|τα Τρία Εψιλον[/tpl]) or "The Steelhelmets" ([tpl]lang|el|οι Χαλυβδόκρανοι[/tpl]), in allusion to the German paramilitary [tpl]lang|de|Stahlhelm[/tpl].

Everett Pierce Marshall (January 12, 1939 – June 20, 2006) was an American businessman and a son of J. Howard Marshall II.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.factweb.net/everett-pierce-marshall | title=E. Pierce Marshall Profile | work=factweb.net | date=January 1998 - Present[/tpl]
According to a Dallas Morning News article, he was a very private man, but became known due to defending the long-running legal dispute from his father's third wife, Anna Nicole Smith.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/072206dnmetmarshall.1818c79.html | title=Legacy Oil Heir Never Wanted | work=dallasnews.com | date=2006-07-22[/tpl]
Marshall attended Millersburg Military Institute, Culver Military Academy, Webb School and received his undergraduate degree from Pomona College in 1961. He began his career at General Motors as an engine test engineer, followed by a brief tour with the United States Navy. After leaving the Navy, Marshall worked for the New York investment banking firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Co. He used this experience later when he entered the securities brokerage business in the 1980s.  
Beginning in 1969, Marshall moved to Houston, Texas to manage various investment projects with his father, including various roles at Koch Industries, International Oil & Gas and Marshall Petroleum. While continuing to work with his father he also worked with his father-in-law. In 1981, after his father-in-law's death, he was elected Chairman of the Electron Corporation (an iron foundry concern). Later, he was appointed President of Electron and led the company through a successful turnaround, saving over 300 jobs in Colorado and Oklahoma. When his father's health began to deteriorate in 1993, he ceased his securities brokerage business, delegated his responsibilities at Electron and assumed operational responsibilities at Marshall Petroleum.
J. Howard died in 1995, leaving Pierce the bulk of the family fortune. In 2001, a jury in Texas upheld the estate and rejected all claims against him.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.factweb.net/case-history | title=Marshall Case History | work=factweb.net | date=January 1998 - Present[/tpl] However, Smith's legal dispute with Pierce in federal court yielded decisions both for him and against him. The issue of the probate exception reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Smith (Marshall v. Marshall). The federal case has been remanded to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to adjudicate appellate issues not previously reached. On June 25, 2009 the same three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on the remaining appellate issues in the case and submitted the case for consideration and final adjudication.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_subpage.php?pk_id=0000003654 | title=Marshall v.

In a February 9, 2007 interview with Fox News Channel's John Gibson, Rusty Hardin, the family's attorney, said that the family would wait until Smith's immediate affairs in the wake of her sudden death are disclosed before discussing the status of litigation. 
A motorsports enthusiast, Marshall competed in the last running of the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, better known as the Cannonball Run, in April, 1979. Teamed with SCCA racers Dave Faust and Kirby Goodman, Marshall drove a Chevrolet Malibu with the 9C1 Police Patrol Package and a 350 cubic inch LT-1 Z-28 Chevrolet Camaro engine, finishing 13th in a field of 47 competitors, completing the run from Darien, Connecticut to Redondo Beach, California in 36 hours, 51 minutes. Marshall wrote, "Over two decades later, the laughs and the memories are still fresh. I was fortunate to be involved".Yates, Brock (2002) "Cannonball!: Worlds's Greatest Outlaw Road Race" MBI Publishing Company. ISBN 0-7603-1090-4

[[Grand Slam (PBA)]]
CATEGORIES: Philippine Basketball Association lore

The Grand Slam in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) refers to a PBA team who has won all three conferences (tournaments) in a single season. After the PBA reduced the number of conferences from three to two beginning in 2004, the term became quite obsolete to some. However, some dispute the claim that a team who could win all titles in a season can be said as a grand slam. The three-conference season format was revived in the 2010-2011 season which means a grandslam is at stake.
The 2000–2009 decade would be the first decade where there would be no grand slam winner; the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s all had at least one grand slam winner. Barangay Ginebra came the closest with two consecutive championships from 2004-2005 but was beaten by Red Bull in the wildcard phase of 2004-2005's second conference. Red Bull could've had won both conferences of the 2005-2006 season but they were beaten by Purefoods in the second conference. Since 2005, no team was able to win successive championships, although Ginebra won two more times in that span, but in the 2010 - 2011 season the 3 conference format was revived thus giving way to all teams of having a chance to win the grand slam.

CATEGORIES: Augustinian monasteries in France, Former buildings and structures in Paris, 1108 establishments in France, 18th-century disestablishments in France, Monasteries destroyed during the French Revolution

The Abbey of St. Victor, Paris, also known as Royal Abbey and School of St. Victor, was an abbey near Paris, France. Its origins are connected to the decision of William of Champeaux, the Archdeacon of Paris, to retire to a small hermitage near Paris in 1108. He took on the life, vocation and observances of the Canons Regular, and his new community followed the Augustinian Rule. 
William was famed for his teaching, and was followed to his hermitage by many of his disciples, including Peter Abelard, and was convinced by them to take up his lecturing again. William was made Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne in 1113, and was succeeded in his hermitage at St. Victor's by Gildwin, who promoted the canonical order and its new abbey vigorously.
Through generous gifts from popes, kings, queens, and nobles, the Abbey of St. Victor was soon richly endowed. Many houses of canons regular came under its influence and were reformed through its leadership, including the Abbey of Ste Geneviève (Paris), Wigmore Abbey in Wales, St. Augustine's (Bristol), St. Catherine's (Waterford), St. Thomas's (Dublin), and San Pietro ad Aram (Naples). King Louis VIII mentioned no less than forty abbeys of the Order of St. Victor in his last will and testament, and he left 4,000 pounds to be equally divided among them, and all his jewels for the building of the abbey church in Paris. Before the abbey was 160 years old, several cardinals and at least eight significant abbots had been produced from among its members.
The traditions of William of Champeaux were handed on, and the abbey became a center of piety and learning, attracting famous students, scholars and intellectuals including Hugh of St. Victor, Peter Lombard and Thomas Becket. In fact, the school of Saint Victor, with the schools of Ste Geneviève and Notre-Dame de Paris, was the cradle of the University of Paris.
The abbey later fell on hard times, being identified in the 17th and early 18th centuries with the Jansenist movement. It was dissolved and destroyed during the French Revolution.
The site of the former abbey is now largely occupied by Paris VI and VII Universities and by the Muséum and Jardin des Plantes. The name survives in a neighbouring street.

Lights from the Valley  is the seventh album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack, released in the summer of 1978; the album marked the recording debut of Brian MacLeod with the band.
Intended to consolidate the success of the precedent  Dreams, Dreams, Dreams album, Lights from the Valley was somewhat of a disappointment, the financial problems at Mushroom Records due to litigation with the rock band Heart causing Lights from the Valley to be underpromoted.
The album's title derives from the lyrics of its lead single "Arms of Mary", the Sutherland Brothers and Quiver song being the first outside material Chilliwack had recorded since the outfit had changed their name from the Collectors in 1970. "Arms of Mary" became the fourth single by Chilliwack to reach the Billboard Hot 100 but like the band's precedent Hot 100 entrants it failed to become a major hit peaking at #67. Chilliwack would subsequently be absent from the Hot 100 for three years until the autumn of 1981 when the band would score its US Top 40 breakthrough with "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)".

[[Claret Ash]]
CATEGORIES: Fraxinus, Ornamental trees

The Claret Ash or Raywood Ash is a cultivar of ash tree, a seedling variant of the Caucasian Ash (Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. oxycarpa). The original seedling was discovered near a group of assorted ash trees in Sewell's nursery in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia about 1910, and later grown at the nearby property Raywood (Former home of the Downer family). The tree was introduced to Britain in 1928 and to North America in 1956, although it did not become widely available there until 1979.
The tree grows to around 15-20 metres and has dark green leaves that turn to a dark claret red in the autumn. The bark of the tree is notably smoother than the Caucasian Ash, which is quite apparent on those trees grafted on Caucasian Ash stock.  In Australia and the United States a decline or dieback in some older trees has been observed which has been attributed to a combination of environmental stress and the presence of the fungus Botryosphaeria.

[[Rainwater tank]]
CATEGORIES: Water conservation tools, Sustainable gardening, Appropriate technology, Liquid containers, DIY culture, Irrigation, Water supply infrastructure, Water conservation

A rainwater tank (sometimes called a rain barrel in North America in reference to smaller tanks, or a water butt in the UK) is a water tank used to collect and store rain water runoff, typically from rooftops via rain gutters. A rainwater catchment or collection (also know as "rainwater harvesting") system can yield 2358 litres (623 gal) of water from 2.54 cm (1 in) of rain on a 93 m2 (1,000 sq ft) roof. Rainwater tanks are devices for collecting and maintaining harvested rain. 
Rainwater tanks are installed to make use of rain water for later use, reduce mains water use for economic or environmental reasons, and aid self-sufficiency. Stored water may be used for watering gardens, agriculture, flushing toilets, in washing machines, washing cars, and also for drinking, especially when other water supplies are unavailable, expensive, or of poor quality, and when adequate care is taken that the water is not contaminated and is adequately filtered.
Underground rainwater tanks can also be used for retention of stormwater for release at a later time and offer a variety of benefits described in more detail below. In arid climates, rain barrels are often used to store water during the rainy season for use during dryer periods.
Rainwater tanks may have a high (perceived) initial cost. However, many homes use small scale rain barrels to harvest minute quantities of water for landscaping/gardening applications rather than as a potable water surrogate. These small rain barrels, often recycled from food storage and transport barrels or, in some cases, whiskey and wine aging barrels, are often inexpensive.  There are also many low cost designs that use locally available materials and village level technologies for applications in Developing Countries where there are limited alternatives for potable drinking water.Camilli, Luis (2000), Rainwater Harvesting: constructing a cistern and gutter system using village technologies and materials, Maji Safi Rainwater Harvesting Manual  While most are properly engineered to screen out mosquitoes, the lack of proper filtering or closed loop systems may create breeding grounds for larvae. With tanks used for drinking water, the user runs a health risk if maintenance is not carried out.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs22.htm  |title=Rainwater, Fact Sheet |accessdate=2007-02-17 |work=greenhouse.gov.au: Your Home Technical Manual |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070216210324/http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs22.htm  |archivedate = 2007-02-16[/tpl]

The Brenner Base Tunnel ([tpl]lang-de|Brennerbasistunnel[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-it|Galleria di base del Brennero[/tpl]) is a planned [tpl]convert|55|km|mi|0|adj=on[/tpl] long railway tunnel through the base of the Brenner massif. It will run from Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof in Austria to Franzensfeste (Fortezza) in Italy, replacing part of the current Brenner railway. The line is part of Line 1, the Berlin to Palermo route, of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T).
The Brenner Pass, in the Alps at the border between Austria and Italy, is one of the most important traffic connections between northern and southern Europe, and the motorway going over it is infamous for its frequent traffic jams. Pollution from this traffic is a major concern.
The hope is to relieve this situation by greatly improving the railway connection between North Tyrol and South Tyrol with the new tunnel, which will allow trains to cross the Alps much faster. Currently, speeds in the Brenner region barely exceed [tpl]convert|70|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl] due to the steepness of the existing tracks, which cross the pass at a rather high elevation.
The project is funded by Austria and Italy, and a contribution by the European Union.  Due to the magnitude of the project (it will be the world's second longest tunnel, after the Gotthard Base Tunnel), the funding promised so far will not suffice for the estimated costs. The tunnel is scheduled to be completed in 2025.

The travel time from Innsbruck to Bolzano will be reduced from 2 hours to 50 minutes.

[[Bryan Charnley]]

CATEGORIES: 1949 births, 1991 deaths, English caricaturists, Alumni of the Central School of Art and Design

Bryan Charnley (1949 – 1991) was a British artist most famous for a series of self portraits he painted examining his schizophrenia and the effect of the different medications he used to control the condition. 
Bryan Charnley intended his work to show the common humanity of the sufferer and how the artist can transform the most negative situations into the basis for creative inspiration.Bryan Charnley was born on 20 September 1949 in Stockton on Tees.  With his twin brother he grew up in London, Chislehurst in Kent, Cranfield, where his father worked as a Senior Lecturer and finally in Bromham in Bedford. In 1967, aged 17 he suffered a nervous breakdown but was able to study at Leicester School of Art in 1968. He gained as place at Central School of Art and Design in Holborn, London in 1969 but was unable to complete the course due to another breakdown later diagnosed as acute schizophrenia. From 1971 until 1977 he lived at home with his parents between periods of hospitalisation and treatment including ECT. In 1978 he moved to Bedford and began painting. The first paintings were representational works including large flower paintings. From 1982 onwards his work began to address his inner life, dreams and mental states particularly the nature of schizophrenia. In 1984 four of his paintings were purchased by the Bethlem Royal Hospital for their permanent collection. He had a solo exhibition at the Dryden Street Gallery, Covent Garden in London 1989 and exhibited two paintings at the Visions exhibition at the Royal College of Art in 1990. However the little recognition he received was outweighed by the day to day problems of his illness and the heavy medication he was prescribed to counter it. His final work, The Self Portrait Series was painted as he experimented with varying dosages of medication. The 17 portraits show graphically the terrible suffering of mental illness. In July 1991 Bryan Charnley committed suicide. The Self Portrait Series was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in 1992.

[[Late Bronze Age collapse]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Near East, Bronze Age, Iron Age, 12th century BC, Prehistoric Asia

The Late Bronze Age collapse was a transition in the Aegean Region, Southwestern Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age that historians, such as Amos Nur and Leonard R. Palmer, believe was violent, sudden and culturally disruptive. The palace economy of the Aegean Region and Anatolia which characterised the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages.
Between 1206 and 1150 BCE, the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria,For Syria, see M. Liverani, "The collapse of the Near Eastern regional system at the end of the Bronze Age: the case of Syria" in Centre and Periphery in the Ancient World, M. Rowlands, M.T. Larsen, K. Kristiansen, eds. (Cambridge University Press) 1987. and the New Kingdom of Egypt in Syria and CanaanS. Richard, "Archaeological sources for the history of Palestine: The Early Bronze Age: The rise and collapse of urbanism", The Biblical Archaeologist (1987) interrupted trade routes and severely reduced literacy. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between Pylos and Gaza was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter: examples include Hattusa, Mycenae, and Ugarit.The physical destruction of palaces and cities is the subject of Robert Drews, The End of the Bronze Age: changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C., 1993.
The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the eventual rise of settled Syro-Hittite states in Cilicia and Syria, Aramaean kingdoms of the mid-10th century BCE in the Levant, and the eventual rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

[[Cross-border town naming]]

CATEGORIES: Geography, Divided cities

Cross-border town naming occurs where towns or villages with the same or equivalent names are divided between two different countries. This does not necessarily imply that those towns or villages are located in geographic proximity, or that they are located near a current border (for that, see Divided cities). Reasons for this taking place may include the following :
Most of these places are located in Europe, but there are also some examples in North America and Asia. In Europe, until the first half of the 20th century, and again in the post-Schengen 21st century, such divisions could be mostly ignored by the inhabitants.

Administrative law in the People's Republic of China was virtually non-existent before the economic reform era. Since the 1980s, the People's Republic of China has constructed a new legal framework for administrative law, establishing control mechanisms for overseeing the bureaucracy and disciplinary committees for the Communist Party of China. However, many have argued that the usefulness of these laws are vastly inferior in terms of controlling government actions, largely because of institutional and systemic obstacles like a weak judiciary, poorly trained judges and lawyers, and corruption.

A member of the noble Georgian family Tsitsishvili (Georgian: ციციშვილი), Tsitsianov participated in suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising and in the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813). In 1802 he became the head of the Russian troops in Georgia.
Tsitsianov's rule in Georgia was characterised by his uncompromising policies towards the local peoples. He answered firmness with firmness, blood with blood, declaring that: "I tremble with eagerness to water our land with your criminal blood," and warned that order would be imposed "with bayonets and grapeshot until your blood flows in rivers".P. Longworth, Russia's Empires, John Murray, 2005, p.191. Though many resented his rule he was largely successful, upgrading the Georgian Military Road, conquering Ganja and subduing Shirvan.
In 1806, and with characteristic bravado, he rode up to the walls of Baku demanding the submission of the city. Troops loyal to the Khan of Baku inside the city walls shot him dead together with his aide-de-camp, then cut off his head and both his hands. The third member of the small mission escaped to relate the gruesome tale.P. Longworth, Russia's Empires, John Murray, 2005, p.192. His head was sent to Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar in Tehran.

[[Arthur Orton]]

CATEGORIES: 1834 births, 1898 deaths, Australian people of English descent, People from Wapping, People from Wagga Wagga, Impostors, Butchers, English emigrants to Australia, English perjurers

Arthur Orton (20 March 1834 – 1 April 1898), the son of a London butcher, went to sea as a boy, spent a year in Chile, and worked as a butcher and stockman for squatters in Australia in the middle-to-late 1850s. He has generally been identified by legal historians and commentators as the "Tichborne Claimant", who in two celebrated court cases both fascinated and shocked Victorian society in the 1860s and 1870s.
In 1866 Thomas Castro, a butcher from Wagga Wagga in Australia, claimed to be Roger Tichborne, the  heir to the Tichborne estates and baronetcy who had been declared lost at sea in 1854. During the protracted court proceedings that followed Castro's claim, evidence was produced that Castro might in fact be Arthur Orton, attempting to secure the Tichborne fortunes by imposture. The verdict of the jury in Regina versus Castro (1873–74) was that Castro was not Roger Tichborne, and that he was Arthur Orton. He was sentenced to fourteen  years imprisonment for perjury. After his release he lived in great poverty, still insisting that he was Tichborne. In 1895 he confessed to being Orton, but retracted almost immediately. He died in 1898; the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the names "Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne" to be placed on the coffin.
Commentators  have generally concurred with the court's verdict that the Claimant was Orton, but some 20th-century analysts have raised uncertainties about this accepted view, and have suggested that although the Orton identity remains the most likely, a lingering doubt remains.

Operation Mersad was the name given by the Iranian government, taken from the Persian word meaning 'ambush' was the last major military operation of the war, ending in a decisive victory for Iran. The operation involved a successful counterattack against a July 1988 military incursion from Iraq, by the bulk of the Iraqi army in the south west, and a military force of about 7000 members of the Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (MEK). The MEK soldiers were armed, equipped and given air support by Iraq and other foreign states. Led by Lt. General Ali Sayad Shirazi, Operation Mersad began on 26 July 1988 and lasted only a few days, where the Iranian Armed Forces crushed the Iraqi Army and MEK in what was the last military operation of any significance of the Iran-Iraq War.
Both Iran and Iraq had accepted United Nations Security Council Resolution 598, which would end the war on 20 July 1988. However, shortly thereafter Iraq decided to violate the ceasefire and launch a new attack, wishing to permanently occupy Khuzestan and western Iran, overthrown the Iranian government, thus reaching its goals from the beginning of the war.[tpl]cite book|last=Farrokh|first=Kaveh|title=Iran at War: 1500-1988|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=9781780962214[/tpl] The Iraqi army attacked Khuzestan province, beginning with chemical weapons and air strikes, and once again pushed towards Khorramshahr, while the Iraqi supported Mujahedeen-e-Khalq militant group attacked central Iran.

[[Presbyornithidae]]
CATEGORIES: Bird families, Presbyornithidae, Prehistoric birds

Presbyornithidae were a family of waterbirds with an apparently global distribution that lived until the Earliest Oligocene, but are now extinct. Initially, they were believed to present a mix of characters shown by waterbirds, shorebirds and flamingos and were used to argue for an evolutionary relationship between these groups, but they are now generally accepted to be "wading ducks", the sister taxon of the Anatidae, and thus essentially modern waterbirds. They were generally long-legged, long-necked birds, standing around one meter high, with the body of a duck, feet similar to a wader but webbed, and a flat duck-like bill adapted for filter feeding. Apparently, at least some species were very social birds that lived in large flocks and nested in colonies.
As the "wading duck" moniker implies, they were waterfowl whose elongated legs enabled them to live a lifestyle similar to the "proto-flamingos" (e.g., Palaelodus) – which were not really ancestors of the modern flamingos, but a group that evolved in parallel with them and in fact seems to have taken over part of the presbyornithid's ecological niche after the latter became extinct. Thus, while probably somewhat capable of swimming, they would have preferred to strain the shallow waters of their habitat for food and were also able to snatch up insects and small crustaceans on dry land, just like some species of modern ducks, e.g., the Laysan Duck, hunt for brine flies.

CATEGORIES: Social anthropology

[tpl]About||the linguistics term dealing with languages unrelated to any other language in the world|Language isolate|other uses|Isolate (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Isolate[/tpl]
Isolates is a term used in developmental psychology and family studies, to describe members of a study group, usually child through young adult, who do not actively participate in cliques or friendship groups.  Isolates are one of four types of participants in friendship networks, the other three being dyads, liaisons and cliques.Richards, W.D., & Rice, R.E., (1981). The NEGOPY network analysis program. Social Networks, 3, 215-223. 
Isolates may have friendly relations with members of cliques and friendship groups, but they do not associate their identity with any particular group. Isolates can be voluntarily or involuntarily isolated from peer groups, cliques or friendship groups. Isolates, overall, may experience higher levels of depression than same-age peers. Studies by Ennett and Bauman (1993), found that isolates are were more prone to smoke than members of friendship groups. Ennett, S.T., & Bauman, K.E. (1993) Peer group structure and adolescent cigarette smoking: A social group analysis. Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 34, 226-236.  A study by Henrich et al. (2000), shows isolates, male and female, have more internalizing problems than non-isolates.Henrich, C. C.,  Kuperminc, G.P., Sack, A., Blatt, S.J., Leadbeater, B.J. (2000). Characteristics and Homogeneity of Early Adolescent Friendship Groups: A Comparison of Male and Female Clique and Nonclique Members. Journal of Applied Developmental Science, 4, 1, 15-26.  The study also shows female isolates have significantly lower GPAs than members of cliques.

[[Gas oil ratio]]
CATEGORIES: Petroleum production, Petroleum economics, Natural gas

When oil is brought to surface conditions it is usual for some natural gas to come out of solution.  The gas/oil ratio (GOR) is the ratio of the volume of gas that comes out of solution, to the volume of oil at standard conditions.
A point to check is whether the volume of oil is measured before or after the gas comes out of solution, since the oil volume will shrink when the gas comes out. 
In fact gas dissolution and oil volume shrinkage will happen at many stages during the path of the hydrocarbon stream from reservoir through the wellbore and processing plant to export. For light oils and rich gas condensates the ultimate GOR of export streams is strongly influenced by the efficiency with which the processing plant strips liquids from the gas phase. Reported GORs may be calculated from export volumes which may not be at standard conditions.
The GOR is a dimensionless ratio (volume per volume) in metric units, but in field units, it is usually measured in cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil or condensate.
In the States of Texas and Pennsylvania, the statutory definition of a gas well is one where the GOR is greater than 100,000 ft3/bbl or 100 Kcf/bbl.

[[Pendlebury railway station]]
CATEGORIES: Disused railway stations in Salford, Former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway stations

Pendlebury railway station was a station in the town of Pendlebury in Greater Manchester.
The station started life as part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Pendleton and Hindley line that grew into (and still exists today as) the Manchester Victoria to Wigan Wallgate line. Heading from Manchester towards Wigan, the preceding station was at Irlams o' th' Height (closed in 1956), and the following station was at Swinton (still open). Pendlebury station was closed in 1960. The existing lines still widen where the island platform existed (removed in 1978).
Ownership had passed from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and upon nationalisation it became property of British Railways.
It was located on Bolton Road (A666), opposite St. Augustine's Church and the former (appropriately named) Station Hotel pub which is nowadays the Isis Italian restaurant. The station was about 760 yards east of the present day Swinton railway station. The station was located just before the entrance to a tunnel underneath Bolton Road. From the site of the station the tunnel goes as far as Swinton Hall Road where it comes out and into a cutting on its way towards Swinton. A 1909 Ordnance Survey map shows no buildings on top of the tunnel's location, suggesting that it was not stable to be built upon at this time. In the Black Harry Tunnel collapse of 1953, part of the tunnel collapsed. Two houses fell into the resultant large void in Temple Drive, Swinton. Five people in the houses were killed. http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=475 .
The Swinton and Pendlebury Journal of 7 October 1960 reported that the last train to call at Pendlebury railway station was the 23:21 from Manchester Victoria to Wigan on the previous Saturday (1 October 1960) - there were 6 people aboard one of whom was a 37-years-old shopkeeper Mr Jackson, proprietor of 419 Chorley Road, Swinton. Mr Jackson reportedly bought the last ticket ever issued at Pendlebury station from the porter Mr D. White - a single to Swinton. Mr Jackson also reportedly travelled to Irlams o' th' Height on 3 March 1956 to purchase the last ever ticket issued there.
A pub, the Station Hotel, was located on the opposite side of the road. The building still exists, but has been refurbished into an Italian restaurant called Isis. Some of the yellow brickwork of the station is still visible on Bolton Road.
The artist L.S. Lowry lived at 117 Station Road (B5231), Pendlebury (close to Swinton railway station); a number of documentary films from the late 1950s (one from the BBC) show him using the station, which was about a mile from his home. 
Clifton Hall Tunnel (sometimes called the Black Harry Tunnel), part of the London and North Western Railway's Clifton Branch, ran underneath the eastern end of the station. The layout was four tracks wide, with an island platform serving two of the tracks being connected to Bolton Road via a footbridge. Several sets of points lay at the eastern end of the station.

The QBB-95 (Type 95) ([tpl]zh|c=轻武器, 步枪, 班用, 1995|p=Qīngwuqi, Bùqiāng—Bānyòng, 1995|l= Light weapon, Rifle, Squad based, 1995[/tpl]) is the light support weapon variant of the Chinese Type 95 family. Based on the QBZ-95, the standard issue to most PLA units, most parts and ammunition of them are interchangeable (while small number of units are issued with Type 56, Type 81, or Type 03 Assault rifle, the latter of which also chambers the same 5.8x42mm DBP87 round). This family includes a standard Assault rifle variant, a compact carbine variant and this particular light support weapon/Squad automatic weapon variant. The longer, heavier barrel and 80-round drum magazine of the QBB-95 allow sustained firing, however the standard 30-round box magazine is also compatible.
Though the QBB-95 and QBZ-95 both take 5.8x42 mm ammo, the QBB-95 normally uses DBP88 "heavy round" machine gun cartridges, which have longer range, deeper armor penetration and better ballistics at long range. As using the heavy rounds on a QBZ-95 would greatly wear the barrel and action, normal cartridges are used on QBZ-95 rifles. However, with the fielding of the QBZ-95-1 variant, newer and heavier DBP10 cartridges will become the standard ammunition for both weapons.WAFF | Asia & Pacific Defence Forum | World's Armed Forces Forum: China Switches To The Good Stuff
Following the development of the improved QBZ-95-1 rifle, its features were developed into the QBB-95-1 LSW.  As a squad machine gun, it already had the barrel features to fire heavy DBP10 ammunition, so the ergonomic enhancements of the new rifle design were incorporated into the new QBB-95-1.http://www.gunsworld.net/china/rifle/qbz95/qbz951.htm (Chinese text)
The weapon is manufactured by Norinco for the People's Liberation Army, the armed forces of the People's Republic of China. An export version known as the QBB-97 family is also available, which fires the 5.56x45mm NATO round.

Richard Marsh Streeton (4 November 1930 - 30 June 2006) was an English sports journalist, concentrating on cricket.
Streeton's father was a manager for HMV and the BBC.  Streeton was educated at King's School, Canterbury, before leading a distinguished naval career. He worked on provincial newspapers in Nuneaton, Mansfield, Nottingham and Kettering, before joining Reuters in 1958.  
He remained at Reuters for over a decade, where his assignments included the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City; England cricket tours to Australia, New Zealand and the West Indies; and the Monte Carlo Rally. 
He joined The Times in 1969, in London.  He originally combined writing with sub-editing, but became a full-time writer from 1977.  He wrote a biography of the cricketer Percy Fender in 1981, writing during a strike of print workers that closed The Times for almost a year.  He became well known as a cricket and rugby correspondent, but also covered badminton, table tennis and cycling.  He went on several winter tours with the England cricket team.  He left The Times in January 1993 and retired to Devon.
A resemblance to the actor Jack Hawkins caused him to be given the nickname "Hawkins".

[[Salisbury cathedral clock]]
CATEGORIES: Salisbury Cathedral, Turret clocks, Individual clocks in England

The Salisbury cathedral clock is a large iron-framed clock without a dial located in the aisle of Salisbury Cathedral. Supposedly dating from about 1386, it is claimed to be the oldest working clock in the world,[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|title=Oldest Working Clock, Frequently Asked Questions, Salisbury Cathedral|url=http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.faqs.php?id=23|accessdate=2011-01-19[/tpl] although a similar claim is made of the clock in the cathedral of Beauvais in France (said to date from 1305).http://www.patrimoine-horloge.fr/med-beauvais.html and the clock tower of Chioggia in Italy. http://nuovavenezia.gelocal.it/cronaca/2013/04/28/news/l-orologio-della-torre-e-il-piu-antico-del-mondo-1.6971068
The clock is one of the group of 14th to 16th century clocks to be found in the West of England. (See also Wells,
Exeter, 
Ottery St Mary, and 
Wimborne Minster.)
An attempt to date this clock to around 1386 was made by T.R. Robinson which has been supported by others. Most of the parts of the striking train are believed to be original. The great wheel of the going train is also believed to be original.
Other clocks from the 14th century (the first century in which the mechanical clock flourished throughout Europe), such as those at Rouen (Gros Horloge), Paris (Heinrich von Wick clock) or Dijon (the clock taken by Philippe le Hardy from Courtrai in 1382), have either been lost, destroyed, or substantially modified. The Wells Cathedral clock might have been made by the same craftsmen as the Salisbury clock, but is usually dated to around 1392, and is now relocated in the Science Museum in London, where it continues to operate.
There are some doubts that the clock displayed in Salisbury Cathedral is actually the clock mentioned in 1386, as the construction is quite advanced and more comparable to clocks made in the 16th and 17th century than those made in the 14th century. The question if this is the 1386 clock is quite important as the Wells Cathedral clock was previously dated in the 16th century, but then dated 1392 after the discovery of the Salisbury clock in 1928. Dating mistakes for old turret clocks are not uncommon. The Dover Castle clock was initially dated in the 14th century, only to be later revised to around 1600.
In 1993, Christopher McKay organised a symposium with the Antiquarian Horological Society to determine if the clock could be dated to 1386. The majority of participants voted for it to be the original, but roughly 1/3 or participants voted the clock to be of a much later date.

[[High-content screening]]

CATEGORIES: Microscopy, Drug discovery

High content screening (HCS) also known as  high content analysis (HCA), or visual screening is a method that is used in biological research and drug discovery to identify substances such as small molecules, peptides, or RNAi that alter the phenotype of a cell in a desired manner.[tpl]cite book | editor = Haney SA | title = High content screening: science, techniques and applications | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | location = New York | year = 2008 | pages = | isbn = 0-470-03999-X [/tpl][tpl]cite book | editor = Giuliano KA, Haskins JR | title = High Content Screening: A Powerful Approach to Systems Cell Biology and Drug Discovery | publisher = Humana Press | location = Totowa, NJ | year = 2010 | pages = | isbn = 1-61737-746-5 [/tpl] Hence high content screening is a type of phenotypic screen conducted in cells. Phenotypic changes may include increases or decreases in the production of cellular products such as proteins and/or changes in the morphology (visual appearance) of the cell.  High content screening includes any method used to analyze whole cells or components of cells with simultaneous readout of several parameters.  Hence the name "high content screening".[tpl]cite journal | author = Gasparri F | title = An overview of cell phenotypes in HCS: limitations and advantages | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 643–657 |date=June 2009 | pmid = | doi = 10.1517/17460440902992870 [/tpl]
In high content screening, cells are first incubated with the substance and after a period of time, structures and molecular components of the cells are analyzed.  The most common analysis involves labeling proteins with fluorescent tags, and finally changes in cell phenotype are measured using automated image analysis. Through the use of fluorescent tags with different absorption and emission maxima, it is possible to measure several different cell components in parallel.  Furthermore, the imaging is able to detect changes at a subcellular level (e.g., cytoplasm vs. nucleus vs. other organelles).  Therefore a large number of data points can be collected per cell.  In addition to fluorescent labeling, various label free assays have been used in high content screening.[tpl]cite journal | author = Proll G, Steinle L, Pröll F, Kumpf M, Moehrle B, Mehlmann M, Gauglitz G | title = Potential of label-free detection in high-content-screening applications | journal = J Chromatogr A | volume = 1161 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 2–8 |date=August 2007 | pmid = 17612548 | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2007.06.022 [/tpl]

Hamilton Hartley Killaly (December 1800 – March 28, 1874) was a civil engineer and political figure in Canada West.
He was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1800, the son of a prominent engineer, and graduated from Trinity College. He served with the Board of Works as consulting engineer. In 1834, with his wife, Killaly came to New York state, later settling in London township in Upper Canada. In 1837, he was involved in a re-survey of the Welland Canal and, in 1838, was appointed engineer for the Welland Canal Company. In 1840, he was appointed chairman of the Board of Works for Lower Canada. In 1841, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for London;[tpl]cite book |title=Vanished Villages of Middlesex |last=Grainger |first=Jennifer |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Dundum Press |isbn=9781896219516 |pages=122-123[/tpl] in March of that year, he was named to the Executive Council. Later that same year, he was named chairman of the Board of Works for the United Province. Although highly competent as an engineer, Killaly had little patience for cost estimates or financial reporting. In 1843, he resigned from the Executive Council as part of the mass resignation to protest Governor General Metcalfe's failure to consult them on political appointments. Some concerns had been voiced regarding decisions made by the Board of Works and, in 1846, it was replaced by the Department of Public Works headed by William Benjamin Robinson. In 1848, Killaly was named superintendent for the Welland Canal. He was named assistant commissioner of public works in 1851 and served until 1859, when this position was abolished and he became inspector of railways. In 1862, he was part of a royal commission that reported on the state of fortifications and defence in the Canadian colonies. Shortly after that, he retired to Picton, where he lived quietly until his death in 1874.
Killaly was described by William Agar Adamson, chaplain to Governor General Lord Sydenham, as "the most expensively and ill-dressed man on the wide continent of North America".

James William Hook (born 27 June 1985) is a Wales international rugby union player for French club Perpignan.
Hook's strengths as a player include good distribution skills, great tactical awareness, and reliable goal kicking, but his popularity in Wales is largely also due to his exciting running style, which is a traditional facet of Welsh fly-half play. This has led to comparisons with New Zealand star Dan Carter and legendary countryman Barry John, who himself hailed Hook as "a real star of the future".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/rugbyunion/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=rugby/07/01/20/RUGBYU_Six_Nations_Wales_Hook.html |title=HOOK HANDED CHANCE TO SHINE |publisher=www.sportinglife.com |date=2007-01-20 |accessdate=2007-11-15 [/tpl] Hook is Wales fourth highest all-time points scorer behind Neil Jenkins, Stephen Jones and Leigh Halfpenny.

 Spring Garden Station is an elevated stop on the Market-Frankford Line, above the corner of 2nd Street and Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the Northern Liberties neighborhood.  It is the final above-ground/outdoor stop for trains before heading into central Philadelphia.
Though SEPTA gives the address as being at 600 North Front Street, the actual location is the median of Interstate 95 over Spring Garden Street. It was built in 1977 when the Market-Frankford Line's tracks were moved to the median of newly extended Interstate 95 for a distance of about 1 mile and replaced the abandoned nearby Fairmount Avenue Station, which was built in 1922 and had been a Skip-Stop "B" station during rush hours. The new station is currently an "All-Stop" station and is nestled in between the northbound and southbound lanes of Interstate 95 between the highway's Girard Avenue and I-676 interchanges.
Passengers utilizing this station may access such nearby sites as Penn's Landing's Festival Pier, popular Delaware Avenue nightclubs, a branch of the Dave and Busters entertainment complex situated on the Delaware River, and a number of bars, restaurants, and shops in the nearby Northern Liberties neighborhood.

Armed (May, 1941–1964) was an American Thoroughbred gelding race horse. He was sired by the great stakes winner Bull Lea, the sire of Citation.  His dam was Armful, whose sire was Belmont Stakes winner Chance Shot, and whose grandsire was the great Fair Play.
Small for his age and very headstrong, Armed's habit of biting and kicking hay out of his handler's pitchfork, along with being practically untrainable, caused his trainer, Ben A. Jones, to send him back to Calumet Farm to be gelded and turned out to grow up.  He returned to the track late in his two-year-old season and resumed training.
His first start was as a three year old the following February and he won at Hialeah Park by eight lengths.  He won again less than a week later but then won only once in five starts and had to be rested due to an ankle injury.
Armed raced for seven seasons, from 1944 to 1950, finishing with a 41-20-10 record in 81 starts. Ridden by Douglas Dodson, the 1947 season saw him defeat U.S. Triple Crown champion Assault in a match race at Belmont Park and also set a new track record of 2:01-3/5 for one and one-quarter miles while winning the Widener Handicap and carrying 129 pounds. He repeated as American Champion Older Male Horse and was voted 1947 American Horse of the Year honors. In the Horse of the Year poll conducted by Turf and Sport Digest magazine he received 151 of a possible 173 votes to win the title from Citation, Stymie, Bewitch and Assault.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LHpWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=feUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6535,703022&dq=armed+horse-of-the-year&hl=en |title= Armed Selected Horse of Year|publisher=Spokesman-Review |date=1947-12-16 |accessdate=2012-02-27[/tpl] Armed died in 1964 of an intestinal tumor.[tpl]cite book|title=The American Racing Manual|year=1965|publisher=Daily Racing Form|pages=1336[/tpl] In 1963, Armed was inducted into National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Barnes, F.; 1968; Barrow and District; Second Edition; Barrow-in-Furness Corporation; Biggar Dyke was built in the Sixteenth century the village was part of Dalton Parish as coastal defence for the village and island. The first mention of the name the 'Queen's Arms' was in 1869 to distinguish it from the recently opened 'New Inn' in the village although it was a beer house as early as 1753. 
Biggar has remained outside of the main urban limits of Walney and Barrow-in-Furness, and is still a small farming village. It lies on the western coast of Walney, to the north of a nature reserve, containing one of England's few oyster farms.

[[Triumph Tina]]
CATEGORIES: Triumph motorcycles, Motor scooters

The Triumph Tina was a small and low-performance scooter with a 100 cc two-stroke engine, an automatic transmission, and a handlebar carry basket.
In 1962, despite internal opposition from those who felt it would dilute the macho image of the brand, Triumph introduced a new scooter, designed by Edward Turner, to tap into a strong demand that had been identified by market research for a simple and easy-to-ride "shopping basket" vehicle.
The Tina used a continuously variable transmission (CVT) system with a centrifugal clutch; the system had been patented by Turner and Triumph in May 1959.  The engine was mounted on the swingarm.
An extensive marketing campaign was carried out, fronted by a pop star of the era, Cliff Richard.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] The Tina was marketed to women, and advertising focused on the ease of its operation. Despite this the Tina sold in small numbers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
The Tina's patented drivetrain had technical problems.  The CVT drive belt would derail and seize the transmission and the rear wheel, not only disabling the scooter but also preventing it from being pushed.  Also, the starting procedure for the Tina required moving a switch on the handlebar to "start" before kick starting the scooter. This activated a governor to keep the engine speed too low to activate the transmission.  If the switch were to be left in "drive" while the scooter was being started, then the motorcycle would accelerate immediately.  This happened to Turner, resulting in a crash into a kerb and a broken ankle.
The Tina was replaced by the Triumph T10 in 1965.  The T10 included an improved CVT and the "start/drive" control moved from the handlebar to inside the seat, where the "drive" setting would be activated by the rider's weight. This weight-activated switched ensured that the rider was seated before the drive was engaged. This led to an embarrassing incident while demonstrating the T10 at its press launch. The switch had been set at [tpl]convert|10|st|lb kg|1[/tpl], but the woman who was to ride the scooter away weighed only [tpl]convert|8|st|lb kg|1[/tpl], the switch was not activated, and the scooter would not move. The T10 was discontinued about 1970.
Triumph made a series of twelve prototype Tina tilting three-wheelers, similar in concept to the Ariel 3 moped.  Disagreements between Triumph and the system's designer ended any plans for production.

[[Triumph Tigress/BSA Sunbeam]]

CATEGORIES: Triumph motorcycles, BSA motorcycles, Motor scooters, Motorcycles introduced in 1959

The Triumph Tigress, also sold as the BSA Sunbeam, was a scooter designed to have good performance and handling for the motorcycle enthusiast. The entry of the BSA group into the scooter field was announced by Edward Turner in October 1958. The 250 cc model would have a cruising speed of [tpl]convert|55|to|60|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] and petrol consumption of [tpl]convert|120|mpgimp[/tpl]. A prototype 250 cc BSA Sunbeam was displayed at the 1958 Earl's Court Cycle and Motor Cycle Show.The Times (London); 30 October 1958 page 6, 15 November 1958 page 5 Manufacture started in late 1959, but delivery difficulties were acknowledged due to problems with recruiting labour, although it was claimed that the group had a manufacturing capacity of 50,000 machines a year.The Times (London); 19 November 1959 page 20, 9 March 1961 page 21 
The design by Edward Turner drew on Triumph's long experience of building fast motorcycles, and was sold under two brand names to take advantage of established distribution networks. This badge engineering was one of the last uses of the Sunbeam marque. The differences between the BSA Sunbeam and Triumph Tigress were entirely cosmetic - the former in polychromatic green paint, also two-tone red and cream, with a BSA badge; the latter in a shell blue with Triumph badging.
The scooter was available with a 250 cc four-stroke twin or 175 cc two-stroke single-cylinder engine.  Both engines were forced-air-cooled. The two-stroke was a development of the BSA Bantam engine but the four-stroke was a completely new parallel-twin with gear rather than chain drive to the gearbox. The contact-breaker fed two ignition coils, each of which had a lead to its spark plug without a distributor. Drive to the rear wheel was by a fully enclosed chain in an oil bath. Both versions had four, foot-operated gears. Some of the 250 twins were fitted with an electric starter and a 12 volt (not 6 volt) electrical system.  The 250 twin sold well and could do 70 mph (105 km/h) with efficient suspension and good roadholding despite having only 10-inch wheels. The only problem was build quality: it was sometimes said that a Tigress was a joy to own so long as someone else was paying the repair bills.
The 250 cc four-stroke model was discontinued in 1964, the 175 cc two-stroke model in 1965.
Later in the 1960s, despite internal opposition from those who felt that scooters would dilute the macho image of the brand, Triumph (owned by BSA) produced another scooter and a motor tricycle for "shoppers".  The Triumph Tina and the Ariel 3 tricycle (BSA also owned the Ariel marque) were intended to tap into the market segment for a convenient 'shopping basket'.

CATEGORIES: County routes in New York

In the U.S. state of New York, county routes exist in all 62 counties except those in the five boroughs of New York City. Most are maintained locally by county highway departments. County route designations are assigned at the county level; as a result, routes often change numbers as they cross from one county to the next due to the lack of a statewide numbering system. Some exceptions exist, such as County Route 36 (CR 36) in Ontario County and CR 36A in Livingston County. The assignment of routes by individual counties also results in varying system density and numbering and signage practices between the state's counties.

 Arvid Afzelius (1857–1923) was a Swedish dermatologist.
As a student at the Karolinska institutet, Afzelius studied under the prominent dermatologist Moritz Kaposi (1837–1902) in Vienna. Kaposi has now become a household name because "his" sarcoma is a common lesion in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
In a 1909 meeting of the Swedish Society of Dermatology, Arvid Afzelius presented research about an expanding, ring like lesion he had observed. Afzelius published his work 12 years later and speculated that the rash came from the bite of an Ixodes tick. This rash is the early stage of Borreliosis, now known as Erythema migrans, an early indication of Lyme disease.
Borrelia afzelii, one of the borrelia species that is an agent of Lyme disease, is named in his honor.

Louis Pergaud (22 January 1882 – 8 April 1915) was a French writer and soldier, whose principal works were known as "Animal Stories" due to his featuring animals of the Franche-Comté in lead roles. His most notable work was the novel La Guerre des boutons (1912) (English: The War of the Buttons). It has been reprinted more than 30 times, and is included on the French high-school curriculum.Tobias Grey, "Waging War(s) of the Buttons in France", Wall Street Journal, 15 September 2011, accessed 2 November 2012
A schoolteacher by profession, Pergaud came into conflict with Roman Catholic authorities over the implementation of the Third French Republic's separation of Church and State enacted in 1905. In 1907 Pergaud chose to move to Paris to pursue his literary career. Pergaud's prose works are often considered to reflect the influences of Realist, Decadent and Symbolist movements. He was killed at age 33 in April 1915, by French fire while in a field hospital behind German lines; he was serving with the French Army near Marchéville-en-Woëvre during the First World War.
The War of the Buttons has been adapted five times as a film, four times in French productions and once in an Irish one. It was adapted most recently in France in two films released the same week in September 2011. Both were set during the twentieth century.

Not to be confused with the defunct Philadelphia Quakers team of the National Hockey League, the Philadelphia Quakers baseball team who became the Philadelphia Phillies in 1890 or the University of Pennsylvania athletics teams, the Pennsylvania Quakers.

The Philadelphia Quakers were a professional American football team that competed in the first American Football League in 1926 and won the league’s only championship. Owned by L. S. Conway,"A.F.L. Fields Nine Teams" New York Times, July 17, 1926 the Quakers played their home games in Sesquicentennial Stadium on Saturdays because of Pennsylvania’s Blue laws prohibiting work or business on Sundays. Coached by Bob Folwell, the majority of the team played their college football in Pennsylvania.David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present (St. Martin’s Press 1994), ISBN 0-312-11435-4 The Quakers had nine players (including Century Milstead, Charlie Way, Butch Spagna, and Bull Behman) who had previously played for various National Football League teams. The combined experience gave the team an edge in line play, particularly on defense (the Quakers yielded only five points per game for the 1926 season). The addition of All-American Glenn Killinger merely added to the defensive riches: he intercepted four passes in his league debut (November 4, 1926, in a 24-0 victory over the Rock Island Independents).1926 American Football League from Elias Sports Bureau and Pro Football Research Association Linescore Committee
Unlike half of their league opponents, the Quakers had no financial connection with league founders C. C. Pyle and Red Grange. In addition to having a championship team, the Quakers drew well in the stadium in the midst of the Sesquicentennial Exposition. When the fair ended (early November), the audience in the soon-to-be renamed Municipal Stadium diminished, but still drew well when the Quakers defeated the New York Yankees 13-7 on a Bob Dinsmore punt return that decided the game - and the league championship (November 27, 1926).1926 American Football League from Elias Sports Bureau and Pro Football Research Association Linescore CommitteeDavid S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present (St. Martin’s Press 1994), ISBN 0-312-11435-4
At the time of the championship-clinching game, the AFL had only four active teams (the Quakers, the Yankees, the Los Angeles Wildcats, and the Chicago Bulls), three of which were being subsidized by C. C. Pyle and Red Grange.David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present (St. Martin’s Press 1994), ISBN 0-312-11435-4 The latter three teams played games in the last two weeks of the season while the Quakers started challenging National Football League teams for a “pro football championship game.” The NFL champions Frankford Yellow Jackets were the first to refuse, claiming that their postseason schedule had been already set. Additional challenges by the Quakers were unanswered until Tim Mara, owner of the seventh place New York Giants, accepted the challenge, scheduling a game for December 12, 1926, at the Polo Grounds.
As the Yankees and the Bulls were playing the AFL’s last official game (a 7-3 Yankees victory in Comiskey Park),1926 American Football League from Elias Sports Bureau and Pro Football Research Association Linescore Committee  the Quakers and the Giants were battling in front of 5000 fans in the middle of a driving snowstorm. While the score was only 3-0 at halftime, Quaker errors led to the Giants winning the game 31-0."New York Giants Beat Quakers in Slop, 31-0" – The Philadelphia Record, December 13, 1926 Both the Quakers and the AFL were no more.
At the end of the season, Wilfred Smith of the Chicago Tribune presented a combined NFL-AFL All Pro team in his column. Three Quakers were named to the second team: George Tully, Bull Behman, and Al Kreuz.1926 All Pros – John Hogrogian, citing Chicago Tribune, December 19, 1926

[[Blount Report]]
CATEGORIES: Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, 1893 in the United States

The Blount Report is the popular name given to the part of the 1893 United States House of Representatives Foreign Relations Committee Report regarding the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.  The report was conducted by U.S. Commissioner James H. Blount, appointed by U.S. President Grover Cleveland to investigate the events surrounding the January 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. 
The Blount Report "first provided evidence that officially identified the United States' complicity in the lawless overthrow of the lawful, peaceful government of Hawaii."Ball, Milner S. "Symposium: Native American Law," Georgia Law Review 28 (1979): 303 Blount concluded that U.S. Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens had carried out unauthorized partisan activities, including the landing of U.S. Marines under a false or exaggerated pretext, to support the anti-royalist conspirators; that these actions were instrumental to the success of the revolution; and that the revolution was carried out against the wishes of a majority of the population of Hawaii.Tate, Merze. (1965). The United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom: A Political History. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. p. 235.      
The Blount Report was followed in 1894 by the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's report by concluding that all participants except for Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani were "not guilty".[tpl]citation |title=Hawaiian Kingdom |first=Ralph Simpson |last=Kuykendall  |authorlink=Ralph Simpson Kuykendall |url=http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom3&l=en |chapter=Chap. 21 Revolution |chapterurl=http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=d-0kingdom3-000Sec--11en-50-20-frameset-book--1-010escapewin&a=d&d=D0.23&toc=0 |volume=3, 1874-1893, The Kalakaua dynasty |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |year= 1967 |origyear=1938 |isbn=978-0-87022-433-1 |id=[tpl]OCLC|47011614|53979611|186322026[/tpl] |accessdate=September 29, 2012[/tpl][tpl]rp|648[/tpl]

[[Saw Mill River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Westchester County, New York, Tributaries of the Hudson River, Subterranean rivers of the United States, Rivers of New York

The Saw Mill River is a 20-mile (32-km) tributary of the Hudson River in the United States. It flows from a marsh in Chappaqua to Getty Square in Yonkers, New York, where it empties into the Hudson. 
The river is best known as the first major waterway in New York State to be "daylighted" in 2011.http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/success/BF_SS-Yonkers-Saw-Mill-032911.pdf  In the 1920s, the United States Army Corps of Engineers buried the last 2,000 feet (600 m) of the river, originally including a small gorge, in a flume under most of Getty Square (Downtown Yonkers) neighborhood.   In 2011, the river was the first major New York State river to be "daylighted" by removing the parking lot that covered it.  The effort was marketed as trying to reverse the Joni Mitchell song Big Yellow Taxi's lyrics that read "They paved paradise to put up a parking lot."  A second section of the river, also in Getty Square in Yonkers in the Mill Street Courtyard, will be "daylighted" in 2014.  The groundbreaking for the Mill Street Courtyard section occurred on March 19, 2014.http://www.lohud.com/story/lohud-real-estate/2014/03/01/yonkers-to-start-new-phase-of-saw-mill-river-daylighting/5885769/http://www.edgewaterdesign.com/?p=920
Known as Nepperhan Creek in the 17th century, the river by the 19th century had seen industry grow up along its lower portion. The New York and Putnam Railroad ran along the river from Putnam County to central Yonkers, and thence to Tibbets Creek and the Harlem River.
The New York and Putnam Railroad was constructed along much of the River's bank in the late 19th century.  Privately owned, service was ended on various parts of the line between the 1940s and the 1980s.  The main line of the railroad is now devoted to bicycle and pedestrian paths.  They are the South County Trailway on the parts south of Route 119, and the North County Trailway north of 119.
In 2008, Groundwork Hudson Valley, the coordinator of the Saw Mill River Coalition, received a three-year $889,183 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Targeted Watershed Grant. It was one of only 15 recipients of a nationwide pool of more than 100 applicants.http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/success/BF_SS-Yonkers-Saw-Mill-032911.pdf
On September 25–26, 2009, the Saw Mill River Coalition organized the first BioBlitz to catalog species of plant life, animal life, insects, fungi, and bacteria in the river and its watershed.BioBlitz 2009 Information
After three years of planning, the City of Yonkers and its partner agencies including Groundwork Hudson Valley and Creative Habitat broke ground on December 15, 2010, on a $34 million effort to expose parts of the flume to daylight, part of the city's $3 billion redevelopment plan. The first phase of the project, which exposed a two-block section of the river in the Getty Square neighborhood of downtown Yonkers, was completed in December 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Saw Mill River celebrates some 'daylighting' in Yonkers|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20111206/NEWS02/312060053/Saw-Mill-River-celebrates-some-daylighting-Yonkers|publisher=lohud.com / The Journal News|accessdate=13 January 2014|date=6 December 2011[/tpl] A public space around this portion of the river, called Van Der Donck Park, was designed by City of Yonkers and Groundwork Hudson Valley with help from the Project for Public Spaces. In all, the plan is to expose a total of six blocks of river by 2015 or so.  The project has stimulated real estate investment in the area.[tpl]cite news|last=Brenner|first=Elsa|title=Restored River a Boon to Yonkers|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/realestate/westchester-in-the-region-restored-river-a-boon-to-yonkers.html|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=9 August 2012[/tpl]   
The river is surrounded by several major roads, such as the Saw Mill River Parkway, which parallels the river along its west bank for much of its route through Westchester County; New York State Route 100; New York State Route 9A; and other suburban road development. Most storm drains from these roads lead into the river. The runoff from streets and untreated storm drains from communities around the river contain pesticides and garbage among other objects. Sedimentation has also been a problem in the river for several decades. These problems are being alleviated through government and community efforts.

Wayne Oren Nordhagen (born July 4, 1948 in Thief River Falls, Minnesota) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder and designated hitter. He played eight seasons in the majors for the Chicago White Sox (1976–81), Toronto Blue Jays (1982), Pittsburgh Pirates (1982) and Chicago Cubs (1983).
Drafted by the New York Yankees in 1968, Nordhagen played in 502 games in his eight major league seasons. In an oddity, Nordhagen was traded twice in ten days for the same player, outfielder Dick Davis. On June 15, 1982, Nordhagen was traded by the Blue Jays to the Philadelphia Phillies for Davis. Later that day, without having played for the Phillies, he was traded again, this time to the Pirates for outfielder Bill Robinson. On June 25, after playing in just one game for the Pirates (going 2-for-4 with 2 RBI), Nordhagen was traded back to the Blue Jays as the player to be named later in a trade that occurred on June 22, in which the Pirates had acquired the very same Dick Davis.Wayne Nordhagen's transactions at Baseball Reference

An inheritance tax or estate tax is a levy paid by a person who inherits money or property or a tax on the estate (money and property) of a person who has died.[ref]
</ref> In international tax law, there is a distinction between an estate tax and an inheritance tax: an estate tax is assessed on the assets of the deceased, while an inheritance tax is assessed on the legacies received by the beneficiaries of the estate.
However, this distinction is not always respected in the language of tax laws. For example, the "inheritance tax" in the United Kingdom is a tax on the assets of the deceased, and is therefore, strictly speaking, an estate tax. For historical reasons, the term death duty is still used colloquially (though not legally) in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth nations to refer to the estate tax.

[[Hilarion of Kiev]]

CATEGORIES: Metropolitans of Kiev and all Rus', Russian religious leaders, Russian writers, Russian saints, Ukrainian saints, Ukrainian writers, 11th-century bishops, 11th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops, Year of birth unknown, Year of death unknown

Hilarion or Ilarion ([tpl]lang-ru|Иларион[/tpl], [tpl]lang-uk|Іларіон[/tpl]) was the first non-Greek Metropolitan of Kiev. While there is not much verifiable information regarding Hilarion's biography, there are several aspects of his life which have come to be generally accepted.
According to the Primary Chronicle Hilarion served as a priest or monk in the princely residence of Berestovo (Berestov) near the Rus' capital of Kiev. He acquired the reputation of well-educated scholar and upon the death of Metropolitan Theopemptus in 1049, Hilarion was proclaimed the metropolitan of Kiev by Yaroslav the Wise, the Grand prince of Kiev, who thus challenged the old Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees.
Hilarion's appointment met with stiff opposition from Luka Zhidiata, Bishop of Novgorod (r. 1035-1060). Zhidyata openly opposed probably because it was the prerogative of the Patriarch of Constantinople to appoint the Kievan metropolitan and thus Hilarion's appointment was uncanonical. For his opposition, Luka was confined in the Kievan Caves Monastery for three years until his death, at which time his remains were taken back to Novgorod and buried in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom there.Michael C. Paul, "A Man Chosen By God": The Office of Archbishop in Novgorod, Russia 1165-1478 (PhD Dissertation, University of Miami, 2003).
It appears as though Hilarion did not serve an extended term as the Kievan metropolitan, as some chronicles began mentioning Metropolitan Yefrem in 1055. Nevertheless, Hilarion remains the best known of all the ancient Kievan metropolitans, not only because he was the first native to ascend to that position, but also because of his writings.
Hilarion is credited as the author of four works:

[[Self-healing material]]

CATEGORIES: Materials science, Smart materials, Catalysis

Self-healing materials are a class of smart materials that have the structurally incorporated ability to repair damage caused by mechanical usage over time. The inspiration comes from biological systems, which have the ability to heal after being wounded. Initiation of cracks and other types of damage on a microscopic level has been shown to change thermal, electrical, and acoustical properties, and eventually lead to whole scale failure of the material. Usually, cracks are mended by hand, which is unsatisfactory because cracks are often hard to detect. A material that can intrinsically correct damage caused by normal usage could lower costs of a number of different industrial processes through longer part lifetime, reduction of inefficiency over time caused by degradation, as well as prevent costs incurred by material failure. For a material to be strictly defined as self-healing, it is necessary that the healing process occurs without human intervention.  Some examples shown below, however, include healing polymers that require intervention to initiate the healing process.

[[Muffle furnace]]

CATEGORIES: Industrial furnaces, Decorative arts, Pottery

A muffle furnace (sometimes, retort furnace) in historical usage is a furnace in which the subject material is isolated from the fuel and all of the products of combustion including gases and flying ash.Bulletin - United States Geological Survey, Issues 47-54, 1889, pp. 180 (834)  After the development of high-temperature electric heating elements and widespread electrification in developed countries, new muffle furnaces quickly moved to electric designs.Electric Muffle Furnace, C.A. Crowley, Popular Mechanics, 67:6, June 1937, pp. 941-945
Today, a muffle furnace is (usually) a front-loading box-type oven or kiln for high-temperature applications such as fusing glass, creating enamel coatings, ceramics and soldering and brazing articles.  They are also used in many research facilities, for example by chemists in order to determine what proportion of a sample is non-combustible and non-volatile (i.e., ash). Some digital controllers allow RS232 interface and permit the operator to program up to 126[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] segments, such as ramping, soaking, sintering, and more. Also, advances in materials for heating elements, such as molybdenum disilicide offered in certain models by Vecstar, can now produce working temperatures up to [tpl]convert|1800|C|F|0|abbr=off[/tpl], which facilitate more sophisticated metallurgical applications. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
The term muffle furnace may also be used to describe another oven constructed on many of the same principles as the box type kiln mentioned above, but takes the form of a long, wide, and thin hollow tube used in roll to roll manufacturing processes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
Both of the above mentioned furnaces are usually heated to desired temperatures by conduction, convection, or blackbody radiation from electrical resistance heating elements.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]  Therefore there is (usually) no combustion involved in the temperature control of the system, which allows for much greater control of temperature uniformity and assures isolation of the material being heated from the byproducts of fuel combustion.

[[Globidens]]

CATEGORIES: Mosasaurs, Prehistoric reptiles of North America, Fossil taxa described in 1912

Globidens ("Globe teeth") is an extinct genus of mosasaur lizard.
Globidens alabamaensis was first described by Gilmore (1912). A second species (G. dakotensis) was described by Russell (1975). The third North American species (G. schurmanni) was added by Martin (2007)
Globidens was ~6 m (20 ft) in length and in appearance very much like other mosasaurs (streamlined body with flippers, a laterally flattened tail and powerful jaws). The teeth of Globidens were vastly different from other mosasaurs, as they were globular, as suggested in its generic name. Generally, most mosasaurs had sharp teeth evolved to grab soft, slippery prey like fish and squid, which, in later species, were later modified to rend flesh, as well. While many other mosasaurs were capable of crushing the shells of ammonites, none were as specialized in dealing with armored prey like Globidens. Globidens, unlike most other mosasaurs, had semispherical teeth with rounded nubbin-like points, which were much better suited for crushing tough armored prey like small turtles, ammonites, nautili, and bivalves.  Like its larger relative, Mosasaurus, Globidens had a robustly built skull with tightly-articulating jaws. Such features no doubt played a large role in its ability to penetrate the armor of its shelled prey.
The smaller genus Carinodens  is regarded as a sister taxon of Globidens.

[[Bounded quantifier]]
CATEGORIES: Quantification, Proof theory, Computability theory

In the study of formal theories in mathematical logic, bounded quantifiers are often added to a language in addition to the standard quantifiers "∀" and "∃".  Bounded quantifiers differ from "∀" and "∃" in that bounded quantifiers restrict the range of the quantified variable. The study of bounded quantifiers is motivated by the fact that determining whether a sentence with only bounded quantifiers is true is often not as difficult as determining whether an arbitrary sentence is true.
Examples of bounded quantifiers in the context of real analysis include "∀x>0", "∃y0" says "for all x where x is larger than 0", "∃y0 ∃y2)"}} says "every positive number is the square of a negative number".

CATEGORIES: Bridge conventions

Asptro is a contract bridge  bidding convention used to intervene over a 1NT  opening bid.[tpl]OEB|7|267[/tpl]  Its methodology and hence its designation is a combination of two similar conventions – Aspro and Astro. 
Partner can bid two of the anchor suit, 2M, expecting to play that contract (sign off). 2[tpl]Diams[/tpl] is a non-forcing enquiry, if available, and 2NT is a forcing enquiry. Other replies are natural. Responder can also pass with 6+ length in the bid minor. (You cannot expect support from partner but it might be the least evil).
After a 2[tpl]Diams[/tpl] reply, the 2[tpl]Clubs[/tpl] intervenor passes with five diamonds or bids the 5 card suit, always the unknown one with 5-5. 
After a 2NT reply, the intervenor routinely bids the unknown suit. Both the anchor and the unknown major imply both majors with preference for the new one. Thus 3[tpl]Hearts[/tpl] and 3[tpl]Spades[/tpl] may be refined, such as by a strength difference with 3[tpl]Spades[/tpl] stronger.

[[Libonectes]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous plesiosaurs, Prehistoric reptiles of North America

Libonectes (meaning "southwest swimmer") is an extinct genus of sauropterygian reptile belonging to the plesiosaur order. It is known from a single fossil specimen found in the Britton Formation of Texas, dated to the lower Turonian stage of the late Cretaceous period.
The animal was very similar to the related Thalassomedon, though the structure of the neck vertebrae were different, with taller neural spines and longer supporting processes of the bone, and its nostrils were slightly closer to the tip of the skull. The skull of the type specimen is the best preserved elasmosaurid skull known. The specimen consists of the skull and neck, as well as gastroliths found along with the fossil. A shoulder girdle and flipper were also found but were apparently discarded at some point in the past.Carpenter, K. (1999). "Revision of North American elasmosaurs from the Cretaceous of the western interior." Paludicola, 2(2): 148-173.
The specimen was originally named Elasmosaurus morgani by Welles in 1949, but it was reclassified in its own genus by Carpenter in 1997.

[[Troas (fictional planet)]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional planets, Isaac Asimov

Troas is a fictional planet that serves as the setting for the science fiction novellas "Sucker Bait" by Isaac Asimov and "Question and Answer" by Poul Anderson as part of a proposed Twaine Triplet.  It may have been created by John D. Clark, who is known to have created the scenario for the earlier Twaine Triplet The Petrified Planet.
Troas is part of the Lagrange system, named after Joseph Louis Lagrange, who first worked out the existence of Lagrangian points.  Located within the globular cluster Messier 13, the Lagrange system is a binary star system consisting of a blue-green star called Lagrange I and a red star called Lagrange II.  (This is contrary to standard astronomical nomenclature.  The two stars should be called Lagrange A and B.)
Troas, also known as Junior, is located in the system's L5 point, also known as a Trojan point after the Trojan asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit in the Solar System.  It was for this reason that Troas was given its name, after the Troas region of Asia Minor where ancient Troy was located.  The system's L4 point is occupied by a group of asteroids called Lagrange Epsilon, also known as the Puppies.
Troas is about the same diameter and mass as Earth, with a rotation period of 36 hours.  The atmosphere of Troas has a sea level pressure of 106.6 kilopascals, and consists of 30% oxygen and 70% nitrogen, with less than 1% hydrogen, helium and carbon dioxide.  Troas is in the midst of an ice age, with large polar ice caps covering both poles, though both ice caps are slowly retreating.  Troas has a single large continent 16,000 kilometers across straddling the equator, with mountain ranges near each coast and a large river system that empties out into the sea through a gap in the western coastal mountain range.  Troas has extensive photosynthetic plant life and considerable animal life.
Troas has a single satellite, Ilium, also known as Sister, with an atmospheric pressure of 13.3 kilopascals.  Although there is no longer any free water on Ilium, there are large former sea bottoms that have formed salt flats.

Bien is the only weekly Danish-language newspaper published in the United States. Bien is one of two Danish-language newspapers published in the United States. The other is a biweekly, Den Danske Pioneer, a unit of Bertelsen Publishing Co., based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois.
Bien, which is Danish for “the bee”, was founded in 1882 by a Norwegian clergyman. It was originally published in San Francisco. In 1975, it was bought by Poul Andersen, a printer for the Los Angeles Times, who relocated Bien to Burbank, California, so he could edit the newspaper after completing his shift at the Times. To commemorate the newspaper’s 100th anniversary, Andersen was knighted into the Order of the Dannebrog by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 1982 for his work to unite the Danish American community.
Bien is considered the last newspaper in California to be printed using Linotype, according to the California Newspaper Publishers Association. When Andersen, who had been a Linotype operator at the Los Angeles Times, sold Bien in 2001, the newspaper switched from Linotype to computer typesetting. It is published in Burbank, California and has a circulation of approximately 3,000. Jytte Madsen currently serves as publisher and editor-in-chief of Bien.

[[List of most luminous known stars]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of stars, Hypergiants, Supergiants, Milky Way Galaxy, Lists of superlatives in astronomy

Below is a list of stars arranged in order of decreasing luminosity (increasing bolometric magnitude). Accurate measurement of stellar luminosities is quite difficult in practice, even when the apparent magnitude is measured accurately, for four reasons:
Because of all these problems, other references may give very different lists of the most luminous stars (different ordering or different stars altogether). Data on different stars can be of somewhat different reliability, depending on the attention one particular star has received as well as largely differing physical difficulties in analysis (see the Pistol Star for an example). The last stars in the list are familiar nearby stars put there for comparison, and not among the most luminous known. It may also interest the reader to know that the Sun is more luminous than approximately 95% of all known stars in the local neighborhood (out to, say, a few hundred light years), due to enormous numbers of somewhat less massive stars that are cooler and often much less luminous. For perspective, the overall range of stellar luminosities runs from dwarfs less than 1/10,000th as luminous as the Sun, to supergiants over 1,000,000 times more luminous.

Blue Guitars is a Blues album released by Chris Rea on October 14, 2005 consisting of eleven CDs, one DVD and a full colour book, including paintings by the artist, liner notes and song lyrics. The album is an ambitious project with the 137 songs recorded over the course of 1½ years with a work schedule - according to Chris Rea himself - of twelve hours a day, seven days a week. Initially the project was inspired by Bill Wyman's "Blues Odyssey" and can be called an "odyssey" in its own right, for depicting a journey through the various epochs of Blues Music, starting at its African origins and finishing with modern-time Blues from the 60s and 70s. Subsequently the eleven CDs are titled the following: "Beginnings", "Country Blues", "Louisiana & New Orleans", "Electric Memphis Blues", "Texas Blues", "Chicago Blues", "Blues Ballads", "Gospel Soul Blues & Motown", "Celtic & Irish Blues", "Latin Blues" and "60s & 70s".
The collection is the fifth and last release in a line of Blues recordings Chris Rea has made since recovering from a serious disease at the turn of the millennium and promising himself a return to his Bluesy roots in the event that he survived.
According to Rea "Blue Guitars" will be his last solo effort; however, he will continue to release albums as a member of the band "Memphis Fireflies".

The Austin Twelve was introduced by the Austin Motor Company in 1921. It was the second of Herbert Austin's post World War I models and was in many ways a scaled-down version of his Austin Twenty, introduced in 1919. The slower than expected sales of the Twenty brought about this divergence from his intended one-model policy. The Twelve was announced at the beginning of November 1921 after Austin's company had been in receivership for six months.Austin. The Times, Friday, 4 November 1921; pg. 17; Issue 42869 The number twelve refers to its fiscal horse power (12.8) rather than its bhp which was 20 and later 27.

This legislative corpus concedes autonomy (self-government) to a subnational unit, and the articles usually mimic the form of a constitution, establishing the organization of the autonomous government, the electoral rules, the distribution of competences between different levels of governance and other regional-specific provisions, like the protection of cultural or lingual realities.
In Spain, the process of devolution after the transition to democracy (1979) created 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, each having its own Statute of Autonomy. On June 18, 2006, Catalonia approved in referendum a new but controversial Catalan Statute of Autonomy, enhancing the degree of autonomy of this Spanish territory.

Victory at Entebbe is a made-for-television film from 1976 based on an actual event: Operation Entebbe and the freeing of Israeli hostages at Entebbe Airport (now Entebbe International Airport) in Uganda. The airport is Uganda's main airport and is situated near the capital city of Kampala, Uganda.
The film starred Anthony Hopkins, Burt Lancaster, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Dreyfuss and Kirk Douglas, and was directed by Marvin J. Chomsky.  Julius Harris portrayed Idi Amin, following the untimely, fatal heart attack suffered by the original actor, Godfrey Cambridge.
It was filmed on videotape at The Burbank Studios, California and later transferred to film for distribution around the world, giving the film the slightly stilted visual style of a studio-bound TV drama but with a film-like look and big Hollywood names in the cast. Shooting on video shortened the production time, allowing the film to be ready for television less than six months after the event that inspired it. 
Linda Blair and Helmut Berger were dating each other during production.

Ballognatha is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders), with the single species B. typica. It occurs in Karakorum.
The species and genus were described based on a single immature and misclassified specimen. It is highly likely that there exists no real species with characters fitting the original description. Genus and species are thus a nomen dubium.Jerzy Proszynski: Ballognatha typica

Naukowe | journal=Annales Zoologici | month=2005 | volume=40 | pages=439–440.[/tpl] There are eight species currently described within the genus, the earliest noted being the type species clynotis severus, first described in Queensland, New South Wales, Australia in 1879 by Ludwig Carl Christian Koch. The most recent was described in 1931 by Lucien Berland.[tpl]cite web | url=http://research.amnh.org/oonopidae/catalog/names.php?genus=Clynotis | title=Taxa where genus is 'Clynotis' | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | date=2014 | accessdate=24 March 2014 | author=Platnick, Norman I.[/tpl] Twoother species previously held within the genus were subsequently reclassified into the genus Tara.
As with most salticidae spiders, members of this genus are known for their ability to jump with agility, and for their strong vision.[tpl]cite journal | title=Salticidae | author=Richman, D.B., Edwards, G.B. & Cutler, B. | journal=American Arachnological Society | year=2005 | pages=205–216[/tpl] They are identifiable from the distinct shape of the cephalothorax and their eye patterns. Of their eight eyes, the front row of four feature a dramatically prominent anterior median pair, while the rear row of four eyes may be described as strongly bent, or as being rearranged into two rows, with two large posterior lateral eyes furthest back. These supply lateral vision, while the forward four are adapted to detailed, three-dimensional vision for purposes of estimating the range, direction, and nature of potential prey, permitting the spider to direct its attacking leaps with great precision.Crompton, J. (1954). The Life of the Spider. Mentor, p. 77.
Also in common with other salticidae, they use their silk for safety lines while jumping. They construct silken "pup tents", where they shelter from bad weather and sleep at night. They molt within these shelters, build and store egg cases within them, and also spend the winter in them.[tpl]cite book|title=Biology of Spiders|first=Rainer F.|last=Foelix|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|page=11|isbn=0-674-07431-9[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Subduction volcanoes, Pleistocene volcanism, Holocene volcanism, Garibaldi Lake volcanic field

The Garibaldi Lake volcanic field is a volcanic field, located in British Columbia, Canada. It was formed by a group of nine small andesitic stratovolcanoes and basaltic andesite vents in the scenic Garibaldi Lake area immediately north of Mount Garibaldi was formed during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The oldest stratovolcano, Black Tusk, formed between about 1.3 and 1.1 million years ago (Ma). Following glacial dissection, renewed volcanism produced the lava dome and flow forming its summit. Other Pleistocene vents are located along and to the west of the Cheakamus River. Cinder Cone, to the east of Black Tusk, produced a 9-km-long lava flow during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene.
Mount Price, west of Garibaldi Lake, 5 km south of Black Tusk, was formed in three stages of activity, dating back 1.1 million years, the latest of which produced two large lava flows from Clinker Peak during the early Holocene that ponded against the retreating continental ice sheet and formed The Barrier, containing Garibaldi Lake.
The Table is a steep-sided andesite tuya, situated approximately 3 km southwest of Mount Price and south of Garibaldi Lake. It rises 305 meters above glaciated basement rocks. The tuya formed by effusion of flatlying flows within erratics on its summit and lack of erosional features attributable to glacial suggest that The Table was also formed during the early Holocene.
Mount Garibaldi is the largest volcano in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in southern British Columbia, and is one of the few Cascade volcanoes that is made exclusively of dacite (Glacier Peak is the other).
Round Mountain is an eroded volcanic outcrop, located 8 km southwest of Eanastick Meadows, 9 km east of Brackendale and 10 km south of Mount Garibaldi. It is the highpoint of Paul Ridge and last erupted during the Pleistocene.
Opal Cone is a cinder cone on the southeast flank of Mount Garibaldi. It is the source of a 15 km long broad dacite lava flow with prominent wrinkled ridges. The lava flow is unusually long for a silicic lava flow.
Clinker Peak is a stratovolcano on the west shoulder of Mount Price on the west side of Garibaldi Lake. It has produced two large lava flows about 9,000 years ago.
Glacier Pikes is a lava dome with two rocky points at the southern end of the Sentinal Glacier Neve.

Šimun Kožičić Benja (born ca. 1460 in Zadar, died 1536 in Zadar) was a Croatian nobleman, the bishop of Modruš and the founder of the Glagolitic printing house in Rijeka. 
He was born into the prominent Benja-Kožičić family. His mother was Venetian from the Contarini household. While his parents wanted him to become a soldier he decided to enter the priesthood. After his education in Zadar and Rome, he became a canon and the prefect of the Church of St. John near the port in Zadar. 
Pope Julius II named him bishop of Modruš in 1509 in a time of uncertainty in Croatia after the Croatian loss to the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Krbava Field of 1493.
Kožičić wrote the well-known work Psaltir which was a small prayerbook which contained some basic Christian prayers, as well as some psalms and other songs for prayer and for use in mass. These kinds of booklets were the basics which aspiring priests and other believers used to learn to read. On the first page of Kožičić's Psaltir, at the very top, was written a primer which contained all the Croatian letters written in  Glagolitic script. After this came the Our Father, Hail Mary and the start of the Apostles Creed. 
At the Fifth Lateran Council in Rome in 1513, Šimun Kožičić Benja lectured on the hardships of his homeland in a speech called De Croatiae desolatione (Desolated Croatia) and sought help. After the Turks attacked Modruš, Benja travelled to Rijeka in 1530 and founded his Glagolitic printing press.
By 1531 he printed five more books in Glagolitic: Oficij rimski (a prayer book), Knjižice krsta (a book of rites), Misal hruacki (a missal), Knjižice od žitija rimskih arhijerov i cesarov (a historic work about the Roman popes and emperors) and Od bitja redovničkog knjižice (a handbook about the proper conduct of clerics).
In 1532 he returned to Zadar where he died in March 1536. He was laid to rest in the Franciscan monastery of St. Jerome in Ugljan, where his brother Ivan Donat put up a grave marker. A retrospective portrait of Bishop Šimun Kožičić Benja is located in the National Museum in Zadar.

All twelve species occur on the islands of the Hawaiian and Marquesas chains.

[[Dutch Baroque architecture]]
CATEGORIES: Baroque architecture in the Netherlands, Dutch architectural styles, Baroque architectural styles, Dutch Golden Age

Dutch Baroque architecture is a variety of Baroque architecture that flourished in the Dutch Republic and its colonies during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century -  Dutch painting during the period is covered by Dutch Golden Age painting.
Like contemporary developments in England, Dutch Palladianism is marked by sobriety and restraint. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from classical antiquity. It found its impetus in the designs of Hendrick de Keyser, who was instrumental in establishing a Venetian-influenced style into early 17th-century architecture through new buildings like the Noorderkerk ("Northern church", 1620-1623) and Westerkerk ("Western church", 1620-1631) in Amsterdam. In general, architecture in the Low Countries, both in the Counter-Reformation-influenced south and Protestant-dominated north, remained strongly invested in northern Italian Renaissance and Mannerist forms that predated the Roman High Baroque style of Borromini and Bernini. Instead, the more austere form practiced in the Dutch Republic was well suited to major building patterns: palaces for the House of Orange and new civic buildings, uninfluenced by the Counter-Reformation style that made some headway in Antwerp.
The major exponents of the mid-17th century, Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post, adopted de Keyser's forms for such eclectic elements as giant-order pilasters, gable roofs, central pediments, and vigorous steeples. Brought together in a coherent combination, these stylistic developments anticipated Wren's Classicism. The most ambitious constructions of the period included the seats of self-government in Amsterdam (1646) and Maastricht (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively. On the other hand, the residences of the House of Orange are closer to a typical burgher mansion than to a royal palace. Two of these, Huis ten Bosch and Mauritshuis, are symmetrical blocks with large windows, stripped of ostentatious Baroque flourishes. The same austerely geometrical effect is achieved without great cost or pretentious effects at the stadholder's summer residence of Het Loo.
The Dutch Republic was one of the great powers of 17th-century Europe and its influence on European architecture was by no means negligible. Dutch architects were employed on important projects in Northern Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, disseminating their ideas in those countries. The Dutch colonial architecture, once flourishing in the Hudson River Valley and associated primarily with red-brick gabled houses, may still be seen in Willemstad, Curaçao, although painted with more varied colors.

Rebelles Européens was one of the most prominent white power rock record labels in the 1980s, along with German Rock-O-Rama Records.  The label was formed in Brest, France by PNFE activist Bodilis Gael in 1987. Before Gael formed the label, he was a manager of French Rock Against Communism band Brutal Combat. Unlike Rock-O-Rama Records, Rebelles Européens releases were almost exclusively of white power/Rock Against Communism bands, whereas Rock-O-Rama also had hardcore, left-wing and apolitical punk bands in their releases. Rebelles Europeéns releases were also never censored, and the label was the first to release openly National Socialist rock music, including No Remorse's first album This Time The World (1988). The label's record covers were usually very provocative, including Swastikas and other racist themes.
From 1987 through 1994, the label released 45 12" records, 30 7" records and five CDs .

The Scottish Rite Dormitory is a private women's dorm for the University of Texas built and operated by the Scottish rite of Freemasons in Austin, Texas. Located just north of campus on 27th Street and Whitis Avenue, the colonial revival style building was completed in 1922 during a housing shortage on campus and was intended to provide housing for the daughters and relatives of Master Masons.
Since its origin the building has relaxed its entry requirements somewhat, but is still well-known among UT students for its strict rules against male visitors. It is one of the more expensive private dorms in the UT area. Many girls are wait-listed for entry to the dorm beginning in high school or earlier.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

[[Tom Jeffords]]
CATEGORIES: 1832 births, 1914 deaths, People from Chautauqua County, New York, People of the American Old West, United States Indian agents, United States Army soldiers

Thomas Jonathan Jeffords (January 1, 1832 – February 21, 1914) was a U.S. Army scout, Indian agent, and later a stagecoach driver in the Arizona Territory. His friendship with Apache leader Cochise was instrumental in ending the Indian wars in that region.
Born in Chautauqua County, NY, Tom Jeffords came west to Arizona in 1862 as a scout for the U.S. Army. Warfare with the Chiricahua Apaches had begun the year before, when Cochise, one of their chiefs, was accused by the Army of kidnapping an 11-year-old white boy from a nearby ranch. (The abduction was likely the work of Pinal Indians.) Hearing this, Cochise came forward under a flag of truce when summoned by the Army to declare his innocence. The Army chose not to believe him and tried to place him under arrest. Cochise pulled his knife, slashed the wall of the tent in which the meeting was being held, and escaped into the brush. The six men who had accompanied him, including three relatives, were held and then hanged (Lt Bascom Affair).
Cochise, formerly inclined toward peace with the white settlers, now joined other Apache chiefs in hostility to them. It was not long before the Army retaliated, and the war was on.
Jeffords was the superintendent of a mail line that later became part of the famous Pony Express system. After some of his mail riders were killed by Apache raiding parties, he rode alone into the camp of Cochise to parley. This bravery so impressed the chief that he became friend and blood brother to Jeffords, granting his mail riders safe passage.
President Grant sent General Oliver Howard to the Arizona Territory in 1871 with orders to end the Apache wars by negotiating treaties with the tribes. Howard was an apt choice, as he had been head of the Freedmen's Bureau, the agency responsible for assisting freed black slaves after the Civil War. General Howard enlisted the help of Jeffords in concluding these treaties. Learning of his work with the Freedmen's Bureau, Jeffords knew that Howard was honorable and would be respected by Cochise, and eventually conducted the general into Cochise’s camp. A treaty was signed in 1872, ending the decade-long war with the Chiricahua Apaches. Cochise requested that his people be allowed to remain in the Chiricahua Mountains and that Jeffords be made Indian agent for the region. These requests were granted, and the Indian raids subsided.[tpl]cite book|title= Cochise, Apache warrior and statesman |first= Edgar|last= Wyatt |publisher= Whittlesey House|year= 1953 |pages=118–123[/tpl]
However, certain white residents of the area disapproved of this arrangement because it denied them access to the copper and silver that had been discovered on Apache lands. They branded Jeffords “Indian lover” and wrote scathing reports to politicians back in Washington. In 1875 he was removed as the federal agent and the Chiricahua Apaches were relocated to the San Carlos Reservation. Cochise was spared this; he had died of natural causes about a year after signing the now broken treaty. The Indian wars began again, but were ended in 1918
Arizona with the Battle of Bear Valley, between U.S. Cavalry and Yaqui Indians.
Jeffords became a stagecoach driver, a deputy sheriff of Tombstone, AZ and finally a gold prospector. He lived out the last 22 years of his life in the Tortolita Mountains north of Tucson, AZ, at a homestead near the Owlhead Buttes. He died on February 21, 1914 and was buried in Tucson's Evergreen Cemetery.[tpl]cite book|title= The encyclopedia of the old West |first= Denis |last=McLoughlin|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year= 1977 |pages=256–257|ISBN =978-0-7100-0963-0 [/tpl]
The story of Tom Jeffords, General Howard, Cochise, and the Apache wars was told in historically-based but dramatized form in a novel by Elliott Arnold that was adapted into a 1950 film and a 1956 television show that ran for 72 episodes. The novel was called Blood Brother, movie, and television show were titled Broken Arrow.

Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The shutdown began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4.
The shutdown officially concluded after the legislature adopted a budget on July 8, 2006. All government services were restored by 8:30 am on July 10, 2006.

His eldest brother was Gilbert Kennedy, 1st Lord Kennedy. James was born about 1408, and was sent to the continent to complete his studies in canon law and theology. 
He was a canon and sub-deacon of Dunkeld until his provision and election to that see on 1 July 1437, after the death of Domhnall MacNeachdainn, the last elected bishop who died on his way to obtain consecration from the Pope. He received consecration in 1438, the following year. 
He set himself to reform abuses, and attended the general council of Florence, in order to obtain authority from Pope Eugenius IV for his contemplated reforms. Eugenius did not encourage him in his schemes, but gave him the presentation to the abbacy of Scone in commendam. Bishop James, however, was not Bishop of Dunkeld for long.

[[Private duty nursing]]
CATEGORIES: Nursing specialties

Private duty nursing is the care of clients by nurses, whether an RN (Registered Nurse) or LPN/LVN (Licensed Practical Nurse).
Most nurses who provide private duty care are working one-on-one with individual clients.  Sometimes such care is provided in the client's home, or an institution, such as a hospital, nursing home or other such facility.Private Practice in Nursing: Development and Management, ISBN 0-89443-158-7
Private duty may be paid by private pay, private insurance, managed care organizations, medicare and medicaid.  Many of the private duty nursing cases involve pediatric patients on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) that have long term illnesses such as Cerebral Palsy (CP)and Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI).  Many of the patients have Gastrostomy Tube (G-Tube), Tracheostomy Care (Trach), or Ventilator (Vent).  The private duty nurse are in many cases Registered Nurses (RN) or Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN).
Many private duty nurses are self-employed, work as contractors and many work in the ever growing field of Home Care.  The practice of private duty nursing was in many senses a precursor to a rise (in the 1980s) of wider-scale nurse entrepreneurs.
Non-medical care could be provided by the nurse but is most often provided by unlicensed assistive personnel such as nursing assistants, home-health aides, sitters, professional homemakers, or other titles. These caregivers often do minor housekeeping chores for their clients, but they cannot provide skilled nursing care.

Michael Paul Bertiaux (born January 18, 1935) is an American occultist and Old Catholic Bishop, known for his book Voudon Gnostic Workbook (1988), a 615-page compendium of various occult lessons and research papers spanning the sub-fields of Voodoo, Neo-Pythagoreanism, Thelema and Gnosticism. Long considered by occultists one of the underground classics of 20th century occultism, the book was out of print for many years and fetched increasingly high prices in the antiquarian market before it was reprinted in paperback by Red Wheel/Weiser in 2007. Note that the unique spelling of "voudon" is an innovation of Bertiaux's, (though it is similar to the traditional spelling of vodun). Bertiaux also coined the term vudutronics to refer to his idiosyncratic interpretation of this religion.

[[Miles Away (song)]]

CATEGORIES: John Foxx songs, 1980 songs, Songs written by John Foxx

[tpl]About||other songs|Miles Away (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Miles Away[/tpl]

"Miles Away" is a song by John Foxx, released as a single in October 1980. It was his fourth solo single, following "Burning Car" in July that year. The track was not included on any original album, falling roughly midway between the release of Foxx's debut LP Metamatic in January 1980 and his second album The Garden in September 1981.
Sonically, as well as chronologically, "Miles Away" was a transitional song in Foxx’s catalogue, its instrumentation being heavy with synthesizers, as in previous solo releases, but also featuring the acoustic drum sound that would characterise his remaining 1980s work. No detail on the electronics used in the song appeared on the original single's sleeve, however Foxx's studio equipment at the time included an ARP Odyssey, a Minimoog, an Elka 'String Machine', and an ARP Analog Sequencer.
The fanfare-like synthesizer lines of "Miles Away" were reminiscent of the track "Slow Motion" which opened the album Systems of Romance, Foxx's last with former band Ultravox. Regarding the song's title and subject matter, Foxx said "You know when you're looking out of a window or you're not quite present, you know you're with someone but your mind is on something else, and that is quite often my state of mind I think, so I decided to write a song about it.""A Kind of Wave" French TV interview
The lyrics and cover photograph also appear to reference 'The Quiet Man', an alternate character developed by Foxx in the late 1970s that personified detachment and observation ("I'm a new man when I walk away"). Foxx has described The Quiet Man as habitually wearing a nondescript grey suit that he (Foxx) found in an Oxfam shop. The picture sleeve of "Miles Away" depicts just such a "grey suit, white shirt and dark tie","The Quiet Man" extract arranged across a lounge chair.
The B-side, "A Long Time", was written and performed with Shake Shake, a group comprising Duncan Bridgeman and Jo Dworniak,"A Secret Life" Q&A along with Philip Roberts, all of whom would appear on Foxx’s next album, The Garden. The track's psychedelic flavour foreshadowed Foxx's The Golden Section (1983).
The single made #51 in the UK charts in 1980. "Miles Away" appears on the 1993, 2001 reissues of Metamatic and on the 2008 re-issue of The Garden, which also features an "alternative version" of the song. It also appears on the  John Foxx compilations "Modern Art" (2001), "Glimmer" (2008) and "Metadelic" (2013). A live version performed by John Foxx and Louis Gordon is featured on the album "Neuro Video", recorded at The Luminaire in London, on 24 November 2007.
  "A Long Time" appears on the 1993 reissue of Metamatic and 2001 edition of The Garden while an "alternative version" appears on the 2008 re-issue of "The Golden Section".

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]

Baptornis ("diving bird") is a genus of flightless aquatic birds from the Late Cretaceous, some 87-80 million years ago (roughly mid-Coniacian to mid-Campanian faunal stages). The fossils of Baptornis advenus, the type species, were discovered in Kansas, which at its time was mostly covered by the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow shelf sea. It is now known to have also occurred in today's Sweden, where the Turgai Strait joined the ancient North Sea; possibly, it occurred in the entire Holarctic.
Othniel Charles Marsh discovered the first fossils of this bird in the 1870s. This was, alongside the Archaeopteryx, one of the first Mesozoic birds to become known to science.

[[Bookmark (World Wide Web)]]
CATEGORIES: Web browsers, Internet terminology

In the context of the World Wide Web, a bookmark is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is stored for later retrieval in any of various storage formats. All modern web browsers include bookmark features. Bookmarks are called favorites or Internet shortcuts in Internet Explorer, and by virtue of that browser's large market share, these terms have been synonymous with bookmark since the first browser war. Bookmarks are normally accessed through a menu in the user's web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization. In addition to bookmarking methods within most browsers, many external applications offer bookmark management.
Bookmarks have been incorporated in browsers since the Mosaic browser in 1993."New X-based information systems browser available.", post to comp.infosystems by Marc Andreeseen on February 16, 1993 Bookmark lists were called Hotlists in Mosaic"May World-Wide Web News" in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee and in previous versions of Opera; this term has faded from common use. Other early web browsers such as ViolaWWW and Cello also had bookmarking features.
With the advent of social bookmarking, shared bookmarks have become a means for users sharing similar interests to pool web resources, or to store their bookmarks in such a way that they are not tied to one specific computer or browser.  Web-based bookmarking services let users save bookmarks on a remote web server, accessible from anywhere.
Newer browsers have expanded the "bookmark" feature to include variations on the concept of saving links. Mozilla Firefox introduced live bookmarks in 2004,"Mozilla Foundation Releases the Highly Anticipated Mozilla Firefox 1.0 Web Browser", press release on November 9, 2004 which resemble standard bookmarks but contain a list of links to recent articles supplied by a news site or weblog, which is regularly updated via RSS feeds. "Bookmarklets" are JavaScript programs stored as bookmarks that can be clicked to perform a function.

CATEGORIES: 1755 births, 1838 deaths, Members of the Connecticut General Assembly Council of Assistants (1662–1818), Members of the United States House of Representatives from Connecticut, People of Connecticut in the American Revolution, Yale University alumni

William Edmond (September 28, 1755 – August 1, 1838) was a United States Representative from Connecticut.  He was born in Woodbury, Connecticut and attended the common schools.  He graduated from Yale College in 1778. He then served in the Revolutionary Army during the American Revolution. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1780 and commenced practice in Newtown, Connecticut.
Edmond was member of the Connecticut State House of Representatives 1791–1797, 1801, and 1802. He also served in the Connecticut Senate 1797–1799. He was elected as a Federalist to the Fifth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James Davenport and was reelected to the Sixth Congress and served from November 13, 1797, to March 3, 1801. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1800 and resumed the practice of law in Newtown. He served as an associate judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court 1805–1819. He retired to private life and continued the practice of law. He died in Newtown, Fairfield County, Connecticut on August 1, 1838 and was buried in Newtown Village Cemetery with his two wives, Elizabeth J. Chandler and Elizabeth Payne, and his children Mary E., Elizabeth, Sarah, William Payne, Ann M. and Robert Edmond Edmond, M.D.
His obituary from the Daily National Intelligencer (DC), Sep. 22, 1838, p. 3 reads,
"DEATHS. At Newtown, Conn. Hon. WILLIAM EDMONDS, aged 83 years. The deceased was engaged in the Revolutionary war, in which he was wounded: he was admitted to the bar in 1780 : in 1798 he was elected a Representative in Congress, was re-elected in 1800, and at the commencement of the second session of that Congress he resigned his seat and returned to the practice of his profession, in which he continued with marked success until 1805, when he was elected one of the Judges of the Supreme Court. He continued to hold this office until the adoption of the Constitution of his State. The number of Judges was then reduced from nine to five, and the deceased, with several other members of the Court, retired to private life."

[[Androstenol]]

CATEGORIES: Steroids, Mammalian pheromones

Androstenol is a sex pheromone in pigs, possessing a musk-like odor. 
It is found in large quantities in boar saliva, but also in smaller quantities in human sweat glands. It is analogous to sex hormones yet has minimal or no androgenic activity. Androstenol is secreted by the adrenal gland into systemic circulation in humans: Systemic effects have not been well studied.
Androstenol, or a chemical derivative, is found in truffles, and is offered as an explanation for how pigs locate them deep in the ground.
Both isomers have a weak, characteristic odor; however alpha-androstenol is often associated with a sandalwood-like aroma due to residual solvents (alkyl acetates).

Alfred Einhorn (February 27, 1856 – March 21. 1917) was a German chemist most notable for first synthesizing procaine in 1905 which he patented under the name Novocain .[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  Until that time the primary anesthetic in use was cocaine, however its undesirable side effects (including toxicity and addiction) led scientists to seek out newer anesthetic drugs.
Novocain was found to be comparatively safe and effective, although its anesthetic effects were weaker than cocaine and some patients proved highly allergic.  However, none of the other anesthetics developed during this period proved more effective and Novocain quickly became the standard local anesthesia.  Although its use has largely been replaced by Lidocaine, it is still in use today, most frequently in dentistry.

Svetitskhoveli Cathedral ([tpl]Lang-ka|სვეტიცხოვლის საკათედრო ტაძარი[/tpl], svet'icxovlis sak'atedro t'adzari; literally, "the Living Pillar Cathedral") is a Georgian Orthodox cathedral located in the historical town of Mtskheta, Georgia, [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] northwest of the nation's capital of Tbilisi.
Svetitskhoveli, known as the burial site of Christ's mantle, has long been the principal Georgian church and remains one of the most venerated places of worship to this day. It presently functions as the seat of the archbishop of Mtskheta and Tbilisi, who is at the same time Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia.
The current cathedral was built in the 11th century by the Georgian architect Arsukisdze, though the site itself is even older dating back to the early 4th century and is surrounded by a number of legends associated primarily with the early Christian traditions.
It is the second largest church building in the country, after the recently consecrated Tbilisi Holy Trinity Cathedral, and is listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site along with other historical monuments of Mtskheta.

[tpl]Italictitle[/tpl]

Comodactylus is a genus of "rhamphorhynchoid" pterosaur from the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian-age Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Wyoming, USA, named for a single wing metacarpal.Galton, P.M. (1981). A rhamphorhynchoid pterosaur from the Upper Jurassic of North America. Journal of Paleontology 55:1117–1122.
In 1879 collector William Harlow Reed sent some fossil material he had dug up at Como Bluff in Quarry N° 9, or the "Mammal Quarry", to his employer Professor Othniel Charles Marsh at New Haven. Among it was the bone of a pterosaur, that was subsequently filed, stored and forgotten.
However, in 1981 Peter Galton named, based on this bone, the genus Comodactylus. The type species is Comodactylus ostromi. The genus name is derived from Como Bluff and Greek daktylos, "finger", referring to the wing finger typical of pterosaurs. The specific name honours John Ostrom.
The holotype is YPM 9150, consisting of an intact fourth metacarpal, 57.5 millimetres long. The metacarpal is quite robust with especially the proximal end, that touching the wrist bones, being very expanded. Such proportions are typical for basal pterosaurs, so Comodactylus was not a member of the, advanced, Pterodactyloidea. To what other pterosaur group it did belong has, however, proven difficult to determine, due to a lack of information. The metacarpal is the only known part of the animal. Kevin Padian in 1989 considered it a nomen dubium. David Unwin in 1993 suggested an affinity with Nesodactylus.
The wingspan has been estimated at 2.5 metres (8.2 ft), exceptionally large for a pterosaur not belonging to the Pterodactyloidea. Comodactylus was also the first pterosaur outside of that group, that was found in America.

[[Decalage]]

CATEGORIES: Aerospace engineering

Decalage on a fixed-wing aircraft is the angle difference between the upper and lower wings of a biplane, i.e. the acute angle contained between the chords of the wings in question.
The decalage is said to be positive when the upper wing has a higher angle of incidence than the lower wing, and negative when its angle of incidence is lower. Positive decalage results in greater lift from the upper wing than the lower wing, the difference increasing with the amount of decalage.NACA technical report No.269 The Distribution of Loads Between the Wings of a Biplane Having Decalage (November 1927), p.18. Retrieved on 9 February 2009.
In real life the biplane top wing is usually rigged with less angle of incidence - i.e. negative decalage, causing the airstream separation and ensuing loss of lift (stall) occur first on the lower wing, providing the biplane with extra margin of stability in stall.
Decalage angle can also refer to the difference in angle of the chord line of the wing and the chord line of the horizontal stabilizer.

HM Prison Aberdeen (formerly known as Craiginches) was a medium-security prison, located in the city of Aberdeen, Scotland. The prison is managed by the Scottish Prison Service. Known as one of the most overcrowded prisons in Scotland, it has a design capacity of 155 and is contracted to hold up to 230 prisoners. However, on the first day of an inspection in January 2009 it held 264 prisoners. In 2014, it was closed in favour of the new HM Prison Grampian.
In recent years it has seen an increase in inmates from outside the Grampian Sheriffdom, mainly from Wolverhampton and London. The diverse population leads to many internal feuds and disputes. It runs exceptional drug rehabilitation programmes and has been a pioneer for drug projects such as drug use kits etc. The management also wish to pilot a needle exchange programme. In August 2007 Aberdeen Prison was chosen to pilot a new initiative called the Substance Related Offending Behaviour Program (SROBP) piloted by Officers Graeme Robson and Allan Dewar which looked at prisoners finding the relationship between their substance use and their offending behaviour. This programme has been very sucessesful in reducing rates of recidivism. Aberdeen Prison was also recognised for its investment in in-house Bereavement Counseling services facilitated by Graeme Robson and Wayne Lawson. On 4 June 2008, it was announced that HMP Aberdeen and HMP Peterhead will be merged into a "Super Prison" and a new state of the art prison built on the Peterhead site. 
A new tranche of managers were recruited identifying key skills such as prisoner management, problem solving, project management and compliance. Initially identified was Graeme Robson who is now a Residential Compliance Manager. The "Super-Jail" will accommodate approx 500 places and the new prison will be known as HMP Grampian. Aberdeen Prison which served predominantly Aberdeen city and its environs has been closed to be replaced by HMP & YOI Grampian, a prison located in Peterhead which has been described as a "community facing Prison". However 70% of Grampian's populace will be from Aberdeen city. This will require families to negotiate a single carriageway road over 35 miles. There are no rail links to Peterhead.
Henry John Burnett, the last man to be executed in Scotland, was hanged inside the prison on 15 August 1963.

Colonel Georgios Poulos ([tpl]lang-el|Γεώργιος Πούλος[/tpl]; 1889, Platanos, Aetolia-Acarnania – 1947) was a Nazi collaborator during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. A longtime ultra-nationalist, Colonel Poulos was fanatically  anti-monarchist and anti-communist. In 1943, he organised and led the Poulos Verband, the most feared collaborationist death squad in occupied-Greece. During 1944, his forces were reinforced by the Jagdkommando Schubert, a paramilitary unit raised in Crete by the notorious Friedrich Schubert.
Poulos participated in Sonderkommando 2000, a German counter intelligence unit which aimed at infiltrating the Greek resistance movement. Poulos also worked for the National Union of Greece (EEE), an antisemitic party sponsored by the SS. He and his forces organised and committed many crimes in the rural areas of Greece; the most notorious was the attack on Giannitsa in September 1944, during which about a hundred peasants were executed. The aim of the executions was to instill terror into the supporters of the left-wing EAM/ELAS, as Giannitsa was considered an important resistance centre. However, Poulos and his men killed in an indiscriminate fashion and it is probable that most of the victims had little to do with the Resistance. In March 1945, Poulos and his unit were transferred to Austria, where they remained until the end of the war. In 1947, Colonel Poulos was convicted of treason and executed.

[[Neurotensin]]
CATEGORIES: Neuropeptides

Neurotensin is a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that is implicated in the regulation of luteinizing hormone and prolactin release and has significant interaction with the dopaminergic system.  Neurotensin was first isolated from extracts of bovine hypothalamus based on its ability to cause a visible vasodilation in the exposed cutaneous regions of anesthetized rats.[tpl]cite journal | author = Carraway R, Leeman SE | title = The isolation of a new hypotensive peptide, neurotensin, from bovine hypothalami | journal = J.

Neurotensin is distributed throughout the central nervous system, with highest levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. It induces a variety of effects, including: analgesia, hypothermia and increased locomotor activity. It is also involved in regulation of dopamine pathways. In the periphery, neurotensin is found in endocrine cells of the small intestine, where it leads to secretion and smooth muscle contraction.[tpl]cite journal | author = Friry C, Feliciangeli S, Richard F, Kitabgi P, Rovere C | title = Production of recombinant large proneurotensin/neuromedin N-derived peptides and characterization of their binding and biological activity | journal = Biochem.

[[Phaeacius]]
CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Phaeacius is a spider genus of the family Salticidae (jumping spiders), found in sub-tropical China and between India and the Malay Peninsula, including Sri Lanka, Sumatra and the Philippines. Although other spiders can jump, salticids including Phaeacius have significantly better vision than other spiders, and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat's and 10 times more acute than a dragonfly's. The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately [tpl]convert|2|cm|in[/tpl] to infinity, and in practice can see up to about [tpl]convert|75|cm|in[/tpl].
While most jumping spiders are active hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, generally resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, pieces of wood or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey for a week or more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.
The closest relatives of Phaeacius are in the genus Holcolaetis, and the next closest genera are Portia and Spartaeus.

[[Fred Gerard]]

CATEGORIES: 1823 births, 1913 deaths, People of the Great Sioux War of 1876

Fredrick Frances Gerard (1823 – 1913) was a frontiersman, army scout, and civilian interpreter for George Armstrong Custer's 7th U.S. Cavalry during the Little Bighorn Campaign.
Fred Gerard was a trader at Fort Berthold in the Dakota Territory and was for a time married to an Indian woman, the sister of a warrior named Whistling Bear. Gerard was hired by Lieutenant Colonel Custer to serve at Fort Abraham Lincoln as an interpreter for his Arikara "Ree" scouts, as he was very familiar with the language from his years as a trader. He had lived in Indian country for 31 years at the time and had been involved in several battles.
About dawn on the morning of June 25, 1876, Gerard accompanied Custer and the scouts to a high bluff known as the “Crow's Nest” to view the Little Bighorn River valley below. The scouts could see dust kicked up by an immense pony herd, and claimed to see hundreds of lodges, indicating the presence of thousands of Indians. Custer was unable to see what they were describing and was unwilling to listen to their cautions. Not long afterwards, Gerard rode to a small knoll and saw 40 Indians riding off at the gallop. He shouted back to Custer, "Here are your Indians, running like devils!" 
Custer soon divided his company into four detachments and attacked. As Major Marcus Reno's battalion, Gerard, and the Rees forded the river, to their surprise they saw large swarms of mounted warriors riding towards them to give battle, instead of fleeing at the approach of the cavalry as Custer had presumed. Gerard turned back and overtook Custer's adjutant, Lieutenant William W. Cooke and Captain Myles Keogh, another officer from Custer's column who had accompanied Reno as far as the river. Explaining that the Indians were not fleeing at all but were coming out to fight, Gerard wheeled to rejoin Reno. Cooke and Keogh rejoined Custer and were killed with him and the companies he led. 
When Reno retreated to the bluffs from the timber, Gerard was one of about a dozen men left behind. He and Billy Jackson met up with Lt Charles DeRudio and Private Thomas O'Neill, and the four of them spent the rest of the 25th and most of the 26th hiding in the woods. About midday on the 26th, they were discovered by some Indians, and Gerard and Jackson, who had retained their horses, rode off to draw the Indians away from DeRudio and O'Neill, who had lost their horses.
Gerard served as Dr. Henry Porter’s surgical assistant on Reno Hill. Gerard survived the battle and later testified before the Reno Court of Inquiry. In the official transcripts of the Reno Inquiry, his name is misspelled as "Girard."
In the years following the battle, Gerard returned to civilian life. He eventually married Ella S. Waddell of St. Louis and raised a family. In 1912, Gerard gave his account of the battle to writer Fred Dustin, who was compiling personal narratives from survivors. He died less than a year later after being interviewed. 
Actor Eric Lawson portrayed Fred Gerard in the 1991 film Son of the Morning Star.

The Texas Federation of Women's Clubs Headquarters, now referred to as simply "The Mansion," or "The Fed," is a Georgian Revival mansion located on the southwest corner of 24th Street and San Gabriel Street in Austin, Texas, United States. The building was completed in 1931 to be the headquarters for the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs, with assistance from local philanthropist Clara Driscoll. It was designed by Dallas architect Henry Coke Knight.The Mansion Web site, http://www.themansion.info/
The building sits adjacent to the historic Neill-Cochran House (1855) and is a prominent feature of the Judge's Hill neighborhood, to the west of the University of Texas.
The Mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 24, 1985. It is one of the best remaining examples of Georgian Revival architecture in Texas. Today it is mostly used to host weddings and receptions, though every Thursday night since 1999 the Austin Swing Syndicate holds a swing dance on the [tpl]convert|4000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] sprung polished oak floors of the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs Headquarters.Austin Swing Syndicate, http://www.austinswingsyndicate.org/

Somatomedin is a group of hormones that is produced, when stimulated by somatotropin (STH), to promote cell growth and division.[tpl]eMedicineDictionary|Somatomedin[/tpl]  In this way, they mediate the effect of somatotropin (also known as growth hormone [tpl]eMedicineDictionary|growth+hormone[/tpl]).
They have similar biological effects to somatotropin.
Somatomedins also stimulates Somatostatin production. Somatostatin suppresses growth hormone release. So, levels of somatomedin and growth hormone are controlled via negative feedback. When somatomedin levels are high, they reduce growth hormone levels by stimulating somatostatin production. Initially somatomedins were thought to be produced in the liver in response to a GH stimulus. It is now known that somatomedins are produced in many tissues, and many actions are autocrine or paracrine. The liver is probably the predominant source of circulating somatomedin.Berner Levy Physiology 6th edition|page=723| So, a high level of somatomedins means a high level of growth hormone. And when this happens, somatomedins lower the level of growth hormone by stimulating somatostatin.

Thomas Wallace "Wally" Dunn (December 4, 1911 – April 21, 2004) was a Canadian-born Thoroughbred horse trainer. 
Born in Minitonas, Manitoba, Wally Dunn went to Vancouver, British Columbia at age seventeen where he would find work in Thoroughbred horse racing. One of five brothers who became involved in the sport, his brother Wilson Dunn bred George Royal and brother George trained the 1965 Canadian Horse of the Year. In the 1930s, Wally Dunn took horses south to race at Santa Anita Park in Los Angeles, California. 
Dunn's career as a trainer was interrupted by World War II when he served overseas with the Canadian Army. After the war, Dunn returned to train in California. Among his notable Thoroughbreds was in Correspondent who won 1953's Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Race Course and the following year the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Wally Dunn  had four horses compete in the Kentucky Derby and two in the Preakness Stakes. Correspondent's 5th place finish was his most successful Derby and in 1962 Green Hornet gave a 6th place best in the Preakness.
In 1964, he trained Colorado King who also won the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes and equalled the world record time of 1:46.40 for 1 1/8 miles in winning the American Handicap.  The South-African-Bred Colorado King followed his American and Gold Cup wins with a dominating win in the Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park.
Wally Dunn died in 2004 at his home in Arcadia, California at the age of 93.

[[Common good (economics)]]

CATEGORIES: Goods

Common goods are defined in economics as goods which are rivalrous and non-excludable. Thus, they constitute one of the four main types of the most common typology of goods based on the criteria:
A classic example of a common good are fish stocks in international waters; no one is excluded from fishing, but as people withdraw fish without limits being imposed, the stocks for later fishermen are potentially depleted. To describe situations in which people withdraw resources to secure short-term gains without regard for the long-term consequences, the term tragedy of the commons was coined. For example, overfishing leads to a reduction of overall fish stocks which eventually results in diminishing yields to be withdrawn periodically.
Common goods which take the form of a renewable resource, such as fish stocks, grazing land, etc., are sustainable in two cases:
Sometimes, common goods and club goods are subsumed under the broader term of public goods. However, common goods should not be confused with a different type of public goods: social goods, which are defined as goods that could be delivered as private goods, but are delivered instead by the government for various reasons (usually social policy). This second definition of public goods does not refer to the characteristics of the goods (such as rivalrousness and excludability), but rather to the type of their provision.

[[Malicious Software Removal Tool]]

CATEGORIES: Microsoft software, Spyware removal, 2005 software

Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool is a freely-distributed virus removal tool developed by Microsoft for the Microsoft Windows operating system. First released on January 13, 2005, it is an on-demand anti-virus tool ("on-demand" meaning it lacks real-time protection) that scans the computer for specific widespread malware and tries to eliminate the infection. It is automatically distributed to Microsoft Windows computers via Windows Update service but can also be separately downloaded.[ref]
</ref>
The program is usually updated on the second Tuesday of every month and distributed via Windows Update, at which point it runs once automatically in the background and reports if malicious software is found. Alternatively, users can manually download this tool from Microsoft Download Center. It records its results in a log file located at %windir%\debug\mrt.log. To run it manually at other times, users can start "mrt.exe" using the Command Prompt or Run command in the Start Menu. With Windows 2000 going out of support in July 2010, Microsoft stopped distributing the MSRT tool to Windows 2000 users via Windows Update. Download and usage of the current versions up to 4.20 (May 2013) was still possible; however, starting with version 5.1 (June 2013) Windows 2000 is not supported anymore.
As released, the tool is configured to report anonymized data about infections to Microsoft if any are detected. The reporting behavior is disclosed in the tool's EULA, and can be disabled if desired.[ref]
</ref>
In a June 2006 Microsoft report, the company claimed that the tool had removed 16 million instances of malicious software from 5.7 million of 270 million total unique Windows computers since its release in January 2005. The report also stated that, on average, the tool removes malicious software from 1 in every 311 computers on which it runs. As of [tpl]date|May 19, 2009[/tpl] Microsoft claims that the software has removed password stealer threats from 859,842 machines.[ref]
</ref>
In August 2013, the Malicious Software Removal Tool deleted old, vulnerable versions of the Tor client, in order to end the spread of the Sefnit botnet (which mined for bitcoins without the host owner's approval and later engaged in click fraud.) Approximately two million hosts had been cleaned by October,[tpl]cite web|last=McHugh |first=Molly |url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/tor-botnet-microsoft-malware-remove/ |title=Microsoft's secret battle against the Tor botnet |publisher=The Daily Dot |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2297027/microsoft-uncovers-sefnit-trojan-return-after-groupon-click-fraud-scam |title=Microsoft uncovers Sefnit Trojan return after Groupon click-fraud scam - IT News from |publisher=V3.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Name |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2014/01/09/tackling-the-sefnit-botnet-tor-hazard.aspx |title=Tackling the Sefnit botnet Tor hazard - Microsoft Malware Protection Center - Site Home - TechNet Blogs |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl] although this was slightly less than half of the estimated infections, the rest of the suspected machines presumably not having their automatic Windows Updates enabled or manually run.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/news/home/-/blogs/7924054 |title=Microsoft Takes Aim at Tor-Distributed Botnet - Computing Now | Newsfeed - IEEECS |publisher=Computer.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl]

[[Packard Super Eight]]

CATEGORIES: Packard vehicles, Rear-wheel-drive vehicles, 1940s automobiles

Packard Super Eight was the name given to the larger of the two eight cylinder luxury automobiles produced by the Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan. It shared frames and some body types with the top model Packard Twelve. Following the discontinuation of the Seventeenth Series Packard Twelve after the 1939 model year, a new Super Eight One-Eighty was derived from the Super Eight as the new top car range. The Super Eight was renamed the Packard Super Eight One-Sixty. These two models shared most mechanical components including the 160 HP straight Eight engine.
After 1942, Packard concentrated on the new Clipper styling that was developed for an upper-class sedan the previous year. There were Super Clippers and Custom Super Clipper in the One-Sixty and One-Eighty tradition until 1947. After a heavy facelift, the name Clipper was dropped. The most senior Super Eight One-Eighty became the Custom Eight, while its slightly lower-priced sibling, the Super Eight One-Sixty, once again became simply the Super Eight. Clipper Custom Super Eights and Custom Eights were very close relatives to their respective Super models, distinguished outside by the lack of an eggcrate grille and small rear chrome trim moulding under t he trunk lid on Supers. In 1949, a new Super Eight Deluxe was added to the line. This car had also the Custom Eight's eggcrate grille, but not the rear trim.
The entire range of Packard's motorcars was renamed for the 1951 model year (twenty-fourth series), when the Super Eight was renamed 300, thus bringing to a close the long reign of the Packard Super Eight.

Alexander Markowich Ostrowski ([tpl]lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Ма́ркович Остро́вский[/tpl]; 25 September 1893, Kiev, Russian Empire – 20 November 1986, Montagnola, Lugano, Switzerland) was a mathematician.
His father Mark having been a merchant, Alexander Ostrowski attended the Kiev College of Commerce, not a high school, and thus had an insufficient qualification to be admitted to university. However, his extraordinary talent did not remain undetected: Ostrowski's mentor Grave wrote to Landau and Hensel for help.
Subsequently Ostrowski began to study mathematics at Marburg University under Hensel's supervision in 1912.
After World War I had ended Ostrowski moved on to Göttingen where he wrote his doctoral dissertation and was influenced by Hilbert, Klein and Landau.
In 1920, after having obtained his doctorate, Ostrowski moved to Hamburg where he worked as Hecke's assistant and finished his habilitation in 1922, becoming Professor of Mathematics at Basel.

In the past the Princess Theatre has seen artistes such as Jim Davidson, Jethro and Jimmy Cricket making regular appearances. However Summer 2002 saw a change from the traditional line-up to a 6 week run consisting of two West End musicals Grease and Chicago. Summer 2003 saw a similar occurrence, featuring The Blues Brothers, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Boogie Nights, with musicals proving to be a popular choice for the local people of Torbay as well as the holidaymakers.

Remission (lat. remittere), in spectroscopy, is the reflection or scattering of light by a material.

The word "re-emission" connotes no such directional character. Based on the origin of the word "emit", meaning "to send out or away", "re-emit" means "to send out again", "transmit" means "to send across or through", and "remit" means "to send back".

Alice and Ellen Kessler (born 20 August 1936 in Nerchau, Germany) are popular twins in Europe, especially Germany and Italy, from the 1950s and 1960s and until today for their singing, dancing, and acting. They are usually credited as the Kessler Twins (Die Kessler-Zwillinge in Germany and Le Gemelle Kessler in Italy), and remain popular today.
In the USA, they were not as popular but appeared in the 1963 film Sodom and Gomorrah as dancers and appeared on the cover of Life Magazine in that year.
Their parents, Paul and Elsa, sent them to ballet classes at the age of six, and they joined the Leipzig Opera's child ballet program at age 11. When they were 18, their parents used a visitor's visa to escape to West Germany, where they performed at the Palladium in Düsseldorf. They performed at The Lido in Paris between 1955 and 1960, and represented West Germany in the 1959 Eurovision Song Contest, finishing in 8th place with Heute Abend wollen wir tanzen geh'n (Tonight we want to go dancing).
They moved to Italy in 1960 and gradually moved to more serious roles. At the age of 40, they agreed to pose on the cover of the Italian edition of Playboy. That issue became the fastest-selling Italian Playboy up until that point. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
They moved back to Germany in 1986 and currently live in Munich. They have received two awards from both the German and Italian governments for promoting German-Italian cooperation through their work in show business.

Many of the genera in this family exhibit brilliant colors and patterns, which sometimes can be attributed to aposematism and crypsis to protect themselves from predators.

CATEGORIES: Churches in Austin, Texas, Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas, Homosexuality and Baptist churches, Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in Texas

University Baptist Church in Austin, Texas, USA, was organized in 1907–1908 to serve students at the University of Texas. Originally leasing space from the Highland Presbyterian Church, the church was officially chartered on September 27, 1908, with 80 original members.
In 1914, the church absorbed members of the then-defunct Central Baptist Church, soon growing to almost 500 members. In 1916 the church purchased land at the southwest corner of 22nd Street and Guadalupe Street to construct a church building. Philadelphia architect Albert Kelsey designed the structure in the Spanish Colonial Revival style to match the University of Texas buildings across the street. It was built to house 1,100 people and was an immediate cornerstone of the "Drag" (Guadalupe Street).
The church welcomed African Americans as members in 1943, becoming one of the first integrated churches in the Southern Baptist Convention. The church was expelled from the Austin Baptist Association for doing so (though it was later readmitted). The church earned further notoriety in the 1970s when it began ordaining women as deacons.
In 1995, the church was again expelled from the Austin Baptist Association for ordaining a gay men as deacon. The church stood by its position, and in 1997, for this and other reasons, the church voted to disaffiliate itself with the Southern Baptist Convention. In recent years the church has become known for its welcoming stance toward homosexuals and has joined several like-minded church organizations. It is affiliated with the Alliance of Baptists,Alliance of Baptist Alliance of Baptist Member Congregations the American Baptist Churches USA, the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists,Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists AWAB Membership and the Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America.University Baptist Church - Links. Accessed 2009-03-18.
The main church building, completed in 1921, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. It features a carved stone facade facing Guadalupe Street and cathedral ceiling vaults with an excellent acoustical signature, and has hosted performances by Willie Nelson and Larry Gatlin. A student union building was added to the west in 1949, featuring a Charles Umlauf sculpture relief over the front door.

A wholesale list is a piece of compilational media (collection of information) providing details for various wholesale companies. One can use a wholesale list to save hours of researching about wholesaling companies as the producer of a wholesale list will already have done it. For example a wholesale list may contain details of companies which sell computers at wholesaler prices to customers. Someone wanting to buy computers at wholesale prices need not spend time and effort hunting for the companies, as there is already a wholesale list on that product existing.

They were quite different from the Admiralty-designed ships of the Admiralty M class class, although based on a basic sketch layout provided by the Admiralty from which J I Thornycroft developed their own design. Like the 'standard' Admiralty M class they had 3 funnels, but the centre funnel was thicker in the Thornycroft ships. The midships 4 in gun was shipped between the 2nd and 3rd funnels. Patriot was fitted to carry a kite balloon.

Giovanni Caracciolo, often called Sergianni (c. 1372 – 19 August 1432) was an Italian nobleman of the Kingdom of Naples, prime minister and favorite of queen Joan II of Naples.
Due to his relationship with queen Joan (starting around 1416), Caracciolo was able to attain for himself a considerable amount of power in the Neapolitan court and a great amount of wealth. Around 1425 he was siniscalco (prime minister) of Naples, count of Avellino, lord of Capua, Melfi, Venosa and numerous other fiefs in Campania and Apulia.
Sergianni managed to obtain an increased power in the realm, until he controlled  its politics and finances almost entirely. He was behind the decision to abandon the pope's support, which eventually led to the invasion of Louis III of Anjou and to Joan's decision to adopt Alfonso V of Aragon as her heir. 
Alfonso had Sergianni arrested in May 1423. However, as the Aragonese soldiers had failed to capture Joan in the siege of Castel Capuano, Sergianni was freed and fled to Aversa with the queen. The situation cleared when Alfonso was called back to Spain, and the queen returned to Naples together with Louis, to whom she was then betrothed. As the latter was a feeble figure who immediately retired to his fiefs in Calabria, the power of Sergianni further increased. Sergianni's exceeding ambition pushed Joan to plot his assassination in 1432. On 19 August 1432, Sergianni Caracciolo was stabbed in his room in Castel Capuano. He was buried in Naples, in the church of San Giovanni a Carbonara.

Phillips is best known as the play-by-play man of the World Hockey Association and National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers since 1973, succeeding longtime Edmonton Eskimos broadcaster Bryan Hall despite having no experience in the field. He is most famous for his loud, long scream of "scoooooooooores!!!!!", considered a classic for Oilers fans. Many fans attending games brought their radios to Rexall Place to listen to his broadcasts, and many people watching games on television turned down the sound to listen to his coverage.  In 2003, Phillips received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Rod Phillips was born in Calmar, Alberta in 1941.[tpl]cite web|url=http://oilers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=530344|title=Rod Phillips retires & Oilers announce 'Rod's Classics'|publisher=Edmonton Oilers|accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl] Prior to being a hockey broadcaster, Phillips hosted Edmonton's first-ever late-night television show in 1967.
Rod Phillips is the uncle of Ottawa Senators defenceman Chris Phillips.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westernstandard.ca/website/article.php?id=2584|title=Bring Stanley home|publisher=Western Standard|accessdate=2009-01-15[/tpl]
Phillips announced his retirement on May 28, 2010. Although retired, he still broadcast 10 more games of the 2010-2011 season, referred to as a "farewell tour" and dubbed "Rod's Classics". These ten games included the Oilers greatest rivals: Calgary Flames, Detroit Red Wings, Phoenix Coyotes née Winnipeg Jets, Montreal Canadiens, New York Islanders, Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins, Colorado Avalanche, Philadelphia Flyers, and Los Angeles Kings, in that order.
Rod called his 3,542nd and final game on March 29, 2011, officially marking his retirement. During a pre-game ceremony before the game, the Edmonton Oilers honored the Hockey Hall of Famer with a banner marked not with a sweater number, but, rather, the number 3,542 which references the number of games he called for the Oilers.
Rod Phillips signed off his final game the way he always did, albeit slightly differently: "Good night, and goodbye, from Rexall Place in Edmonton!"

Royal Rumble (1999) was the twelfth annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on January 24, 1999 at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, California. The title of the event was taken from a promise by Mr. McMahon that the first entrant in the Royal Rumble, Steve Austin, had "no chance in hell" of winning the match. The theme song for the event, based on the phrase, would go on to become the entrance music for McMahon's stable The Corporation and later, just McMahon himself, which he uses to this day.
The main event was the annual Royal Rumble match, which saw the winner receive a title shot for the WWF Championship at the WrestleMania pay-per-view two months later. The Royal Rumble centered around the continuing heated rivalry between Steve Austin and Mr. McMahon, with those men entering the main event at #1 and #2, respectively. The penultimate match for the WWF Championship was an "I Quit" match between Mankind and The Rock, which is remembered both for its brutality and its place in the documentary film Beyond the Mat. Lower down on the card the WWF Intercontinental Championship and WWF Women's Championship were both defended.

For the Distinguished Service Cross recipient, see Edwin Austin.
Earl Edwin Austin was an American criminal and bank robber who had been listed on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" list during the 1970s. 
Born in Takoma Park, Maryland, Austin had been a career criminal for much of his adult life serving sentences for grand larceny, forgery, aggravated assault, escaping prison and, most notably, threatening the President of the United States when Austin sent a threatening letter to then-President Lyndon Johnson as an inmate at the Idaho State Penitentiary (which would result in an additional five years to his sentence).  
In February 1979, although having a history of attempted prison escapes and repeated altercations with police officers, Austin won parole from prison in Kansas City, Missouri and, upon his release, immediately headed south with the intentions of beginning a crime spree where, on February 28, Austin robbed a bank in Houston, Texas of $60,000. 
By mid-July, Austin had raided a series of banks throughout the Southeast from Kentucky to Florida when federal authorities, who had previously charged Austin with bank robbery and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, officially added Austin to the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted List" on October 12. 
After a five-month long federal investigation, Austin was eventually traced to a rented apartment in Tucson, Arizona where Austin was arrested by federal agents on March 1, 1980. At the time of his arrest, Austin had a loaded pistol as well as $10,000 in his possession (a small amount of money from the Houston robbery had been marked, allowing Austin to be connected directly to the crime). Austin, charged with three counts of his three known robberies, was held in custody in lieu of a $35,000 bond before his eventual conviction and imprisonment.

The American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse is an American Thoroughbred horse racing honor awarded annually in Thoroughbred flat racing. It became part of the Eclipse Awards program in 1971.
The award originated in 1936 when both Turf & Sports Digest (TSD) the Daily Racing Form (DRF) began naming an annual champion. Starting in 1950, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) began naming its own champion. The following list provides the name of the horses chosen by these organizations. The only disagreement came in 1968, when Turf & Sports Digest named Forward Pass as champion whereas the other two organisations voted for Stage Door Johnny.
Champions prior to 1936 were selected retrospectively by a panel of experts as published by The Blood-Horse magazine. There were Co-Champions chosen retrospectively for 1876, 1882, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1893, 1894, 1904, 1906, 1917, 1923, and 1932.
The Daily Racing Form, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, and the National Turf Writers Association all joined forces in 1971 to create the Eclipse Award.

It is composed of three neighborhoods located on a plateau just west of downtown Austin: Old Enfield, Pemberton Heights, and Bryker Woods. Developed between 1886 and 1953, the three historic neighborhoods stretch from Mopac Expressway east to Lamar Boulevard, and from 13th Street north to 35th Street.

The streetcar had propelled Austin's earlier local suburban development, but Enfield, Pemberton Heights, and Bryker Woods were the city’s first automobile suburbs. As a well-preserved collection of early-to-mid-20th century residences, the historic district evokes the measured spread of suburban development that paralleled the city’s steady growth.

[[Wildland fire tender]]
CATEGORIES: Wildland fire suppression, Trucks, Fire service vehicles

A wildland fire tender is a specialized vehicle capable of bringing water, foam, or dry chemicals to fire trucks in the field that are engaged on the fireline.  These vehicles are specifically designed for fire fighting often with four-wheel drive, rugged suspension and high wheel clearance for mountainous dirt road conditions. According to the National Fire Protection Association, if the apparatus will be used primarily for outdoor and wildland responses, than it is to be considered a wildland fire apparatus and must conform to NFPA 1906.[tpl]cite web|last=David|first=Haston|title=NFPA 1906 and Wildland  Apparatus Design|url=http://www.fdsoa.org/2011_apparatus_symposium/NFPA%201906%20Update%20Urban-Rural-New%20Wildland.pdf|publisher=US Forest Service|accessdate=6 January 2014[/tpl] 
Fire tenders are generally equipped with associated fire station equipment including required number of breathing apparatus, first aid kits, telescopic ladders, heat-resisting fiberglass blankets, overall suits, electrically insulated rubber hand gloves, fireman’s axes with insulated handle, fireman’s helmets made of fiberglass, leather belt and pouch for axe, etc.
Often the technique of pump-and-roll is used where the vehicle drives with the pump engaged while a firefighter uses a hose to spray water on the fire. This technique allows a team of two to flank the perimeter of a fire.[tpl]cite book|title=Fire Fighter Training, S-130|year=2003|publisher=NWCG[/tpl]

The thyrotropin receptor (or TSH receptor) is a receptor (and associated protein) that responds to thyroid-stimulating hormone (also known as "thyrotropin") and stimulates the production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).  The TSH receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins[tpl]cite journal | author = Farid NR, Szkudlinski MW | title = Minireview: structural and functional evolution of the thyrotropin receptor | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 145 | issue = 9 | pages = 4048–57 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15231707 | doi = 10.1210/en.2004-0437 [/tpl] and is coupled to the Gs protein.[tpl]cite journal | author = Calebiro D, Nikolaev VO, Lohse MJ | title = Imaging of persistent cAMP signaling by internalized G protein-coupled receptors | journal = J.

Mill Valley High School is a high school located in Shawnee, Kansas, and is part of the De Soto School District (USD 232). The school began classes in 2000-2001. As of the 2011-2012 school year, its attendance is roughly 1,139.http://svapp15586.ksde.org/rcard/summary/D02320833.pdf The school is much smaller than nearby Shawnee Mission Northwest High School and Olathe Northwest High School, because of the school board's original intent to keep class sizes small.  However, because of ongoing increases in attendance, the school district proposed two bond issues and finally passed one on Nov. 4, 2008. Construction on Mill Valley began in February 2009. The construction was finished in the summer of 2010. The second expansion of the school building follows a prior extension of the "A" hallway including the construction of a dedicated art wing.
Mill Valley students consistently score well above the state requirements in math and reading. In 2011-2012 according to the Kansas State Department of Education Building Report Card, students scored 96.8 percent as proficient or above in reading and 95.4 percent as proficient or above in math.
Mill Valley is a member of the Kansas State High School Activities Association and offers a variety of sports programs. Athletic teams compete in the 5A division and are known as the "Jaguars". Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs.

[[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of Solar System objects, Planemos

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined a planet as a body in orbit around the Sun that was large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to have cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.[ref]
 ([http://www.iau.org/iau0603.414.0.html orig link])</ref> An object in hydrostatic equilibrium is one that is large enough for its gravity to have overcome its internal rigidity, and so relax into a rounded ([[ellipsoid]]al) shape. The practical meaning of "cleared the neighborhood" is that a planet is comparatively massive enough for its gravitation to control the orbits of all objects in its vicinity. By the IAU's definition, there are eight planets in the [[Solar System]]. Those objects in orbit around the Sun that have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium but have not cleared their neighborhoods are called [[dwarf planet]]s, and the remainder are termed [[small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]]. In addition, the Sun itself and a dozen or so [[natural satellite]]s are also massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium.<ref name=mike/> Apart from the Sun, these bodies are included in the term ''planetary-mass object'', or ''planemo''. All known planetary-mass objects in the Solar System, as well as the Sun, are listed below, along with a sample of the largest objects whose shape has yet to be accurately determined. The Sun's orbital characteristics are listed in relation to the [[Galactic Center]]. All other objects are listed in order of their distance from the Sun.

Trials & Errors is a live album released by the Magnolia Electric Co. on Secretly Canadian in 2005, recorded on April 16, 2003 at Club Ancienne Belgique in Brussels.
It was the first Magnolia Electric Co. album released under that name, even though at the time of recording the band still toured under the Songs: Ohia moniker. The album received generally favorable reviews according to Metacritic, with multiple reviewers noticing the homage to Neil Young and Crazy Horse, but offering mixed opinions on its success: "is hard to avoid thinking of Neil Young and Crazy Horse at the peak of their '70s powers" (Mojo, Feb 2005). "Magnolia Electric Co. is no Crazy Horse, and Molina's vocabulary on the guitar doesn't yet have the presence to carry such extended interpretations of his material." (Pitchfork Media, February 1, 2005). The album itself is made up of ten original songs, all but three of which were at the time unreleased, but contains three fragments of Neil Young songs, including the show-closing chorus of "Tonight's the Night" at the end of the song "The Big Beast". The fragments are technically uncredited, but the liner notes contain the information "Songs written by J.M. (Jason Molina) and there are ones that clearly have not, they're included here respectfully. Thank you."

Patients typically receive treatment in cycles of 21 days with no drugs given on days 15-21.See HD14 Redacted Trial Protocol, available at
There also exists a more intensive regimen with cycles of 14 days. Usually a course of BEACOPP therapy consists of four, sometimes six to eight cycles, or in combination with ABVD. 
In some countries BEACOPP still is experimental, in others (e.g. Germany and Austria) it is a standard therapy. In the United States, ABVD (or Stanford V) is generally given instead, because BEACOPP was thought to induce more secondary neoplasias (such as leukemias), although the final results from the GHSG HD14 trial indicate that "there
were no overall differences in treatment-related mortality or secondary malignancies" of BEACOPP relative to ABVD.
Some consider that the BEACOPP regimen is not generally given in the US for cost reasons:
However, BEACOPP delivers approximately 7% points success relative to ABVD for early unfavorable Hodgkin's disease (as measured five-year freedom from treatment failure) and 12% points greater success relative to ABVD for advanced Hodgkin's disease (Stage IIB with risk factors or stages III and IV) as measured by seven-year freedom from treatment failure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Viviani|first=Simonetta|author2=et al.|title=ABVD versus BEACOPP for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  When High-Dose Salvage Is Planned|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=July 21, 2011|volume=365|issue=3|pages=203–212[/tpl]

Mount Pierce is a mountain in the Presidential Range in the White Mountains of New Hampshire that is approximately 4,310 feet (1,314 m) high. Formerly called Mount Clinton for 19th-century governor DeWitt Clinton of New York,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mountwashington.org/about/visitor/mountains.php| title=Mountains of the Presidential Range| publisher=Mount Washington Observatory| accessdate=February 16, 2010[/tpl] in 1913 it was renamed after President Franklin Pierce (1804–69), the only president born in New Hampshire, although the newer name is not universally accepted.[ref]
</ref> 
Its summit offers a wide view of New Hampshire's mountains.
The shortest trail route to the summit of Pierce is from a parking lot to the west of the mountain on Mount Clinton Road just off Route 302.  The trail primarily follows the Crawford Path — the oldest continually used hiking trail in the United States, having been established in 1819 by Abel Crawford.  The Appalachian Trail and Webster Cliff Trail approach from Mount Jackson in the south and meet Crawford Path just north of the summit before continuing to the northeast.  Mount Eisenhower and Mount Monroe lie on the ridge northeast of Mt. Pierce. All three of these peaks are included on the peak-bagging list of four-thousand footers in New Hampshire.

CATEGORIES: Copper alloys, Precious metal alloys, Sculpture materials, Ancient Greek sculpture, Hellenistic and Roman bronzes

Hepatizon (Greek etymology: [tpl]lang|grc|ἧπαρ[/tpl], English translation: "liver"), also known as Black Corinthian Bronze, was a highly valuable metal alloy in classical antiquity.  It is thought to be an alloy of copper with the addition of a small proportion of gold and silver (perhaps as little as 8% of each), mixed and treated to produce a material with a dark purplish patina, similar to the colour of liver.  It is referred to in various ancient texts, but no known examples of hepatizon exist today.
Of the known types of bronze or brass in classical antiquity (known in Latin as aes and in Greek as χαλκός), hepatizon was the second most valuable. Pliny the Elder mentions it in his Natural History, stating that it is less valuable than Corinthian bronze, which contained a greater proportion of gold or silver and as a result resembled the precious metals, but was esteemed before bronze from Delos and Aegina.Aes, from A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875.Pliny's chapter on Corinthian Brass and hepatizon, Chapter 3 of Book 34 from Natural History. As a result of its dark colour, it was particularly valued for statues.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=David M.|title=Corinthian Bronze and the Gold of the Alchemists|journal=Gold Bulletin|url=http://www.goldbulletin.org/downloads/JACOB_2_33.PDF|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-07-06| year=2000|volume=33|issue=3|pages=60–66|doi=10.1007/BF03216582[/tpl]  According to Pliny, the method of making it, like that for Corinthian bronze, had been lost for a long time.
Similar alloys are found outside Europe.  For example, shakudō is a Japanese billon of gold and copper with a characteristic dark blue-purple patina.

[[FinePix S3 Pro]]
CATEGORIES: Fujifilm DSLR cameras

[tpl]refimprove|date=May 2012[/tpl]thumb|250px|right|Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro
The Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro is an interchangeable lens digital single-lens reflex camera introduced in February 2004. Its successor, the Finepix S5 Pro, was released on 25 September 2006. It is based on a Nikon F80 (N80 in the U.S.) viewfinder, shutter, mirror-box and autofocus modules surrounded by a Fujifilm body that includes its own proprietary CCD image sensor and electronics, and a vertical grip shutter release.  It has a Nikon F lens mount and can use most lenses made for 35 mm Nikon SLR cameras, but only with manual operation with Nikon AIS lenses, unusually for a digital SLR the S3 Pro can be used with a manual cable release.
It is autofocusing and has an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/4000 sec. with x-flash synchronization at shutter speeds up to 1/180 sec.  It has built-in exposure metering with spot, center weighted and evaluative modes and also features a pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 through 125, 160, 200, 400, 800 and 1600. The camera is discontinued and no longer in production.
The camera's principal distinction is its 23mm x 15.5mm photo sensor. Designated the Super CCD SR, it is unique in two ways.  First, like its predecessors used in the earlier FinePix S1 Pro and FinePix S2 Pro, it has its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras.  This allows the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lay somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.34 megapixel interpolated output. 
Second, it uses two photodiodes in each photo site when capturing an image at full resolution, with a primary sensor providing the normal sensitivity of a CCD sensor and another which is smaller and less sensitive.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide greater resistance to the gross overexposure of highlights which is more common among digital cameras than film cameras. When used in 6 megapixel mode, the secondary, highlight sensor is disabled and only the larger sensor captures an image.
The S3 can produce images in JPEG format with the option of three rendering tonalities. Two of these ('F1' and 'F2') are generally regarded to emulate the look of Fujifilm colour films. The third ('Standard') gives a more neutral image and may also be set for B&W (monochrome) capture.
Like the S5 which superseded it, the S3 gained popularity amongst numerous, professional Wedding Photographers for its ability to more accuratetly render skin tones and for its wide dynamic range, compared to comparable digital cameras of its time.
The S3 can utilise two types of memory card storage: CF and XD cards.
The camera can be remotely tethered to a computer via a Firewire connection.
A monochrome-only, Live View capability is available for image composition via the rear LCD screen of the camera. This can be viewed for a maximum duration of thirty seconds, at which time mirror lock up is automatically cancelled and default function resumes.

The Gero Cross or Gero Crucifix ("Gero-Kreuz" in German), of around 965–970, is the oldest large sculpture of the crucified Christ north of the Alps, and has always been displayed in Cologne Cathedral in Germany. It was commissioned by Gero, Archbishop of Cologne, who died in 976, thus providing a terminus ante quem for the work. It is carved in oak, and painted and partially gilded – both have been renewed. The halo and cross-pieces are original, but the Baroque surround was added in 1683. The figure is 187 cm high, and the span of the arms is 165 cm.Schiller, pp. 140–142
The figure appears to be the earliest, and finest, of a number of life-size German wood sculpted crucifixions that appeared in the late Ottonian or early Romanesque period, later spreading to much of Europe. Additionally it appears to be the oldest Western depiction of a dead Christ on the cross;Lauer in most earlier depictions Christ holds his head erect and looks straight ahead, or in some Carolingian examples looks down at the Virgin at the foot of the cross.Schiller, 142 lists examples The slumped head, and the twisted body, which arises as the hands are nailed to the cross at different heights, are found neither in Carolingian nor Byzantine art, and were to be slow to influence Western depictions, although the long hair spread over the shoulders is found in some Carolingian works.Schiller, 141–2 In crucifixions of the Gothic period a still more slumped and curved figure of Christ, with knees bent sideways, was to become the standard depiction.
Earlier large figures of Christ on the Cross appear to have been in metal, or metal on a wooden core; there was said to be one in Charlemagne's Palatine Chapel in Aachen, and the Golden Madonna of Essen is an example of this type. Schiller, 140 The development of a tradition of free-standing monumental sculpture was a crucial development in Western art; in Byzantine art such images had been forbidden by the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and probably had been extremely rare before that.
The cross hangs in its own chapel near the sacristy in Cologne Cathedral – now a different, Gothic, building from the one it was made for. The Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg, written 1012-1018, said that it was originally displayed above Gero's grave; though no one is now sure where that was located in the old church, most scholars place it somewhere on the central axis of the nave,Kaspersen & Thunø, pp. 46–7 in which case it may have been at the chancel arch, the usual location of later roods or large crucifixes. It has long been celebrated and visited by pilgrims. Until the 1920s, despite local tradition, and the reference in Thietmar's chronicle,the passage, quoted in Kaspersen & Thunø, pp.45–6 associating it with Gero, it was thought to be at least a century later in date, and it is indeed innovative for its date. The dating was confirmed by dendrochronology in 1976, ending the controversy. Contrary to long-held tradition, the studies in 1976 revealed that there is no space in the back of the head to place relics.Decorating the Lord's Table: On the Dynamics Between Image and Altar in the Middle Ages'', Søren Kaspersen, Erik Thunø, p.59, note 18, 2006, Museum Tusculanum Press, ISBN 87-635-0133-3
According to the Luccan local histories, the Holy Face of Lucca in Italy is considerably older, though that sculpture had to be recreated in the Gothic period after being nibbled away by pilgrims, which makes this claim difficult to verify by art historians.Schiller, 144
A replica of the crucifix hangs in the St. Alphonsus Chapel located in the Alphonse J. Schwartze Memorial Catholic Center in Jefferson City, Missouri.

CATEGORIES: Royal Rumble, 1995 in American sports, 1995 in Florida, 1995 in professional wrestling, 20th century in Tampa, Florida, Sports in Tampa, Florida

Royal Rumble (1995) was the eighth annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on January 22, 1995, in the USF Sun Dome located in Tampa, Florida.
The event featured five matches based on scripted storylines and the results were predetermined by the WWF. The main event was the 1995 Royal Rumble match, which Shawn Michaels won after entering first and outlasting the 29 other wrestlers for the first time in WWF history. The event also featured a match for the WWF Championship, when Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. The match was stopped when several other wrestlers interfered and the referee lost control of the match. Two other title matches took place; Jeff Jarrett won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Razor Ramon, and The 1–2–3 Kid and Bob Holly won the final match in a tournament that determined the new WWF Tag Team Champions.
Several storylines from Royal Rumble 1995 were carried over to WrestleMania XI, the WWF's next pay-per-view. Bam Bam Bigelow attacked National Football League Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor, who was sitting in the crowd; this set up a match between the two at WrestleMania. Pamela Anderson was at ringside and was supposed to accompany the winner of the Royal Rumble match to his WWF Championship match at WrestleMania. Although Shawn Michaels won the match, Anderson came to the ring at WrestleMania with Diesel. The Undertaker's feud with Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation also escalated, as DiBiase's men stole the urn that was said to give The Undertaker his power. Jarrett and Ramon continued to feud for several months, and Bret Hart targeted Bob Backlund because of Backlund's interference in the WWF Championship match.

[[2-Naphthylamine]]
CATEGORIES: IARC Group 1 carcinogens, Naphthylamines

2-Naphthylamine is an aromatic amine. It is used to make azo dyes. It is a known human carcinogen and has largely been replaced by less toxic compounds. 2-Naphthylamine is prepared by heating 2-naphthol with ammonium zinc chloride to 200-210 °C; or in the form of its acetyl derivative by heating 2-naphthol with ammonium acetate to 270-280 °C. It forms odorless, colorless plates which melt at 111-112 °C. It gives no color with ferric chloride. When reduced by sodium in boiling amyl alcohol solution it forms alicyclic tetrahydro-3-naphthylamine, which has most of the properties of the aliphatic amines; it is strongly alkaline in reaction, has an ammoniacal odor and cannot be diazotized. On oxidation it yields ortho-carboxy-hydrocinnamic acid, HO2CC6H4CH2CH2CO2H. Numerous sulfonic acids
derived from 2-naphthylamine are known. Of these, the δ-acid and Bronner's acid are of more value technically, since they combine with ortho-tetrazoditolyl to produce fine red dye-stuffs.

[[Galanin]]

CATEGORIES: Neuropeptides

Galanin is a neuropeptide encoded by the GAL gene, that is widely expressed in the brain, spinal cord, and gut of humans as well as other mammals. Galanin signaling occurs through three G protein-coupled receptors.
The functional role of galanin remains largely unknown; however, galanin is predominately involved in the modulation and inhibition of action potentials in neurons. Galanin has been implicated in many biologically diverse functions, including: nociception, waking and sleep regulation, cognition, feeding, regulation of mood, regulation of blood pressure, it also has roles in development as well as acting as a trophic factor. Galanin is linked to a number of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy as well as depression, eating disorders and cancer. Galanin appears to have neuroprotective activity as its biosynthesis is increased 2-10 fold upon axotomy in the peripheral nervous system as well as when seizure activity occurs in the brain. It may also promote neurogenesis.
Galanin is predominantly an inhibitory, hyperpolarizing neuropeptide and as such inhibits neurotransmitter release. Galanin is often co-localized with classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, and also with other neuromodulators such as neuropeptide Y, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide.

[tpl]inline|date=July 2013[/tpl]The Izanagi Plate was an ancient tectonic plate, which began subducting beneath the Okhotsk section of the North American Plate during 130 - 100 Ma. The rapid plate motion of the Izanagi Plate caused the northward drift of north-west Japan and the outer zone of south-west Japan. Sanbagawa metamorphic rocks were formed in the eastern margin of the drifting land mass, while Abukuma metamorphic rocks were formed in its western margin. At approximately 95 Ma, the Izanagi Plate was completely subducted and replaced by the western Pacific Plate which also subducted in the north-western direction. Subducted-related magmatism took place near the Ryoke belt. No marked tectonics occurred in the Abunkuma belt after the change of the subducted plate.

[/ref] The sounds produced by Ghungroos vary greatly in pitch depending on their metallic composition and size. Ghungroos serve to accentuate the rhythmic aspects of the dance and allow complex footwork to be heard by the audience. They are worn immediately above the ankle, resting on the lateral malleolus and medial malleolus. A string of ghungroos can range from 50 to greater than 200 bells knotted together. A novice child dancer may start with 50 and slowly add more as he or she grows older and advances in his or her technical ability. Ghungroos or Salangais are worn in traditional performances of the classical Indian dance forms: Bharatnatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, and Odissi etc.
Ghunghroo Vadan
Ghunghroo Vadan evolved by V. Anuradha Singh, a renowned Indian classical kathak exponent.She developed bell as a main musical Instrument and perform in many pure music festivals where dance is not allowed. It is the only foot percussive art and it takes great dexterity, superb control, stamina, classical knowledge and physical strength. For the first time in history, V.Anuradha Singh brings to the stage her revolutionary technique of solo Classical Ghunghru (foot bell) Recital which focuses solely on foot percussive art (100 minutes, non-stop in one place).

[[Max von Gruber]]
CATEGORIES: 1853 births, 1927 deaths, Physicians from Vienna, Austrian physicians, Hygienists, German Fatherland Party politicians

Max von Gruber (6 July 1853, Vienna – 16 September 1927, Berchtesgaden) was an Austrian scientist.
As a bacteriologist he discovered specific agglutination in 1896 with his colleague Herbert Edward Durham (Gruber-Widal-reaction). But his main interests were studying the hygiene and the sexual life.
Max von Gruber was the son of Ignaz Gruber (1803-1872), a general practitioner and the first specialist in otology in Austria, and publisher of a two-volume textbook on medical chemistry (1835). His brother was Franz von Gruber. He graduated from the Schottengymnasium in Vienna and studied medicine at the University of Vienna, receiving his medical doctorate in 1876. He then learned chemistry and physiology under Max von Pettenkofer (1818-1901) and Karl von Voit (1831-1908) in Munich and Karl Ludwig (1816-1895) in Leipzig. Also working under Pettenkofer was Hans Ernst August Buchner (1850-1902), who encouraged Gruber to concentrate on bacteriology.
Unlike some of the great names of the time, among them Carl Wilhelm Nägeli, Theodor Billroth (1829-1894), Ferdinand Cohn (1828-1898), and Robert Koch (1843-1910), Gruber recognized that bacteria possess a variability within limits partially determined by the culture medium. This theory was important for the differentiation of the categories of bacteria and gained significance for Gruber in his examinations of cholera vibrios, enabling him to distinguish them from other vibrios.
In 1882 Gruber was habilitated as a lecturer in Vienna, and two years later he became associate professor and head of the newly established Institute for Hygiene at the University of Graz. On 23 March 1887 he became ausserordentlicher professor in Vienna, succeeding Josef Nowak, and on 10 December 1891 he was appointed to the chair of hygiene established in 1875 at the University of Vienna. Karl Landsteiner became his assistant in 1896. Another of his pupils, Alois Lode, in 1897 became the first professor in the new chair of hygiene at the University of Innsbruck. The working conditions in the Institute of Hygiene were so poor, that Gruber attempted to resign his chair and find employment as head of a laboratory in München or at the Jenner Institute in London, under Joseph Lister. It was while in Vienna, however, that Gruber, with his English student Herbert Edward Durham (1866-1945), discovered the agglutination which gained him international fame.
Gruber eventually left Vienna in 1902, and in October that year he succeeded Hans Buchner as director of the Institute for Hygiene in München. He held the post until his voluntary retirement in 1923, on the occasion of his seventieth birthday. In Vienna he was succeeded by Arthur Schattenfroh (1869-1923), who held the chair from 1905 to 1923.
During his last years, Gruber concentrated completely on his duties as president of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.
With Max Rubner and P. Martin Ficker (1868-) he published the Handbuch der Hygiene. 6 volumes; Leipzig, S. Hirtzel, 1911-1913.
As a leading racial hygienist, when he first met the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler he described him as:

[[Floodlight]]
CATEGORIES: Light fixtures, Stadiums

Floodlights are broad-beamed, high-intensity artificial lights. They are often used to illuminate outdoor playing fields while an outdoor sports event is being held during low-light conditions. More focused kinds are often used as a stage lighting instrument in live performances such as concerts and plays.
In the top tiers of many professional sports, it is a requirement for stadiums to have floodlights to allow games to be scheduled outside daylight hours.  Evening or night matches may suit spectators who have work or other commitment earlier in the day.  The main motivation for this is television marketing, especially in sports such as Gridiron which rely on TV rights money to finance the sport.  Some sports grounds which do not have permanent floodlights installed may make use of portable temporary ones instead.  Many larger floodlights (see bottom picture) will have gantries for bulb changing and maintenance.  These will usually be able to accommodate one or two engineers.

CATEGORIES: 1950 births, Living people, American political writers

Charles Cinque Fulwood (born 1950, South Carolina) is a media and communications strategist who pioneered global media campaigns and the use of commercial marketing techniques for non-profit organizations.   Over a 15-year period beginning in the mid-1980s, he served as communications director for Amnesty International USA, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Children's Defense Fund.  Fulwood was chief media strategist for Human Rights Now! Tour, the 1988 world music tour underwritten by Reebok International to promote the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 5 continents.  Fulwood is also credited (Haines, 1996) with designing the campaign strategy that led 18 states to pass legislation that exempts juveniles from the death penalty. 
As Director of Communications at NRDC, Fulwood built a strategic communications operation that included media relations, web site, publications, and a quarterly journal with a circulation of more than 700,000.  One of his many innovations was creation of the International ECO-Awards, which issued more than 100 honors to advertising agencies, design shops, businesses and environmental groups for creativity in promoting appreciation of the environment.  
Fulwood's writing has been published in the St. Petersburg Times, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, PR Quarterly, the Boston Phoenix, and Ramparts magazine. He has also ghost-written op-ed pieces published in The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The Christian Science Monitor, The San Francisco Chronicle, and The Los Angeles Times.   He has given invited lectures at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, DePaul University College of Law, and Morehouse School of Medicine and has spoken at a variety of national and international conferences.  
Fulwood was born in 1950 in Clarendon County, South Carolina and moved to St. Petersburg, Florida with his family in the early 1960s. After earning a bachelor's degree in mass communication, he worked for Pinellas County, Florida government,  then held a series of communications positions with African-American Civil Rights organizations in Atlanta before moving to New York City to work for Amnesty International USA.  
In 1990, the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the most violent of the various Klan factions, sued Fulwood and his client, the Center for Democratic Renewal, for defamation of character after they exposed Klan activity within the Blakely, Georgia Fire Department.  The suit was settled in 1991 and resulted in four Klansmen being forced to resign from the Fire Department.  
Fulwood is a founding partner in MediaVision USA, a strategic communications firm, and specializes in litigation communications, crisis communications, and media campaigns.  He is a member of the teaching faculty at the Johns Hopkins University program in Communications and Contemporary Society, where he and Margo Edmunds are co-instructors for a graduate course in Emergency and Risk Communications.   Fulwood also consulted on the online course in risk communication strategies for the Johns Hopkins Center for Public Health Preparedness.  Fulwood currently resides in the Glover Park neighborhood of Washington, DC.  In November 2011, he was elected to the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for Glover Park, which represents the neighborhood and provides advice to the DC government on key public policy issues.

[[Heegner point]]
CATEGORIES: Algebraic number theory, Elliptic curves

In mathematics, a Heegner point is a point on a modular curve that is the image of a quadratic imaginary point of the upper half-plane. They were defined by Bryan Birch and named after Kurt Heegner, who used similar ideas to prove Gauss's conjecture on imaginary quadratic fields of class number one.
The Gross–Zagier theorem [tpl]harv|Gross|Zagier|1986[/tpl] describes the height of  Heegner points in terms of a derivative of the L-function of the elliptic curve at the point s = 1. In particular if the elliptic curve has (analytic) rank 1, then the Heegner points can be used to construct a rational point on the curve of infinite order (so the Mordell–Weil group has rank at least 1). More generally, [tpl]harvtxt|Gross|Kohnen|Zagier|1987[/tpl] showed that Heegner points could be used to construct rational points on the curve for each positive integer n, and the heights of these points were the coefficients of a modular form of weight 3/2. 
Kolyvagin later used Heegner points to construct Euler systems, and used this to prove much of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for rank 1 elliptic curves. Shouwu Zhang generalized the Gross–Zagier theorem from elliptic curves to the case of modular abelian varieties. Brown proved the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for most rank 1 elliptic curves over global fields of positive characteristic. [tpl]harv|Brown|1994[/tpl]
Heegner points can be used to compute very large rationals points on rank 1 elliptic curves (see [tpl]harv|Watkins|2006[/tpl] for a survey) that could not be found by naive methods. Implementation of the algorithm is available in Magma and PARI/GP

The Society moved to its current location from its long-time home in California in 2007. The Society's journal, The Augustan Omnibus, is published semi-annually.
Boasting one of North America's most complete libraries of some 20,000 volumes dedicated to nobility, chivalry, genealogy, and heraldry, the Society supports research in these fields. In addition to these main goals of fostering research and promoting chivalry, the Augustan Society has sub-groups of interest available to members. The first two were established to promote the ideals of the Society and are as follows:
The other sub-groups are dedicated to providing kinship among members of various lineages, interests, and backgrounds. They are as follows:

[[Ann-Louise Hanson]]
CATEGORIES: Melodifestivalen contestants, Swedish female singers, 1944 births, Living people

Ann-Louise Hanson (born in Kristianstad in 1944) is a Swedish singer and has been involved in the music industry for over 40 years.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=Ann-Louise Hanson | encyclopedia=Nationalencyklopedin | language=Swedish | url=http://www.ne.se/ann-louise-hanson | accessdate=10 May 2010[/tpl]
Many of her solo recordings from the 1960s feature Bruno Glenmarks Orkester and, following their marriage, Ann-Louise and Bruno Glenmark formed the group Glenmarks with Bruno's niece Karin and nephew Anders. Soon after, their own GlenDisc record label began producing vinyl, cassettes and eventually CDs under the banner of 'Hanson-Glenmark Production AB'.
Ann-Louise holds the dubious honour of having entered the Swedish Melodifestivalen competition thirteen times without winning once, which is a record in itself. Of those entries, the songs "Bara en enda gång" (a duet with John Ballard) and "Kärleken lever" are amongst her best remembered. Ann-Louise has also attempted to represent Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest in the past. Having moved to France with Bruno in the late 1980s, she now remains a resident of Kristianstad in Sweden.
1986's synth-based Duva - Flyg igen (Doves - Fly Again) is Hanson's most recent studio album, upon which she shared lead vocals with her daughters Jessica and Josefin on the title track, alongside a duet with Billy Preston on "So Good, So Fine".
Ann-Louise's daughter Josefin Glenmark recently embarked upon her own musical career.

The Palmeral of Elche (Spanish: Palmeral de Elche, Valencian: Palmerar d'Elx) is a plantation of palm trees in the Spanish province of Alicante.  It is the largest palm grove ([tpl]lang-es|palmeral[/tpl]) in Europe and one of the largest in the world, surpassed in size only by some in Arab countries.[tpl]clarify|date=November 2010[/tpl]
The Palmeral includes the Parque Municipal and many other orchards (huertos), covering over [tpl]convert|3.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], including [tpl]convert|1.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] within the city of Elche (Elx).  It contains more than 11,000 palm trees, mostly date palms (Phoenix dactylifera), with individual specimens up to 300 years old.  At its peak, in the 18th century, it may have covered an area twice as large, with up to 200,000 trees.  The dates are harvested in December. A famous date palm is the "Imperial Palm" (Palmera Imperial), with 7 stems in the shape of a candelabra, named after Elisabeth, known as Sissi, the Empress consort of Franz Joseph, who visited the plantation in 1894.
It is thought that palms were originally planted in this location as early as the 5th century BC by Carthaginians who settled in south-east Spain.  The plantation survived under the Romans and was expanded under the rule of the Moors, including the irrigation system extended in the times of Abd ar-Rahman I and which remains in use. The formal landscape of the palmeral that still exists today was created when the city was under Moorish control in the 10th century. This transfer of landscape and agricultural practices from one culture and continent to another (Moorish Africa to Christian Europe) is the reason for inclusion as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Although the area has an annual rainfall of only [tpl]convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], the palm trees planted along a network of irrigation canals from the salty River Vinalopó creates a patchwork of agricultural plots (huertos), each demarcated and shaded by the palm trees to create a protected microclimate.  Laws were passed to protect the plantation after the Reconquista.
In 2005, it was discovered that the larvae of the red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) had infested some trees, laying its eggs inside the stems.

The Learning Grid began as a recommendation of the Motorsport Competitiveness Panel, a body set up by the UK Department of Trade and Industry whose final report was announced by the then Secretary of State Patricia Hewitt on 11 July 2003.DTI announcement The name 'Learning Grid' is thought to refer to a motorsport starting grid, since many of the activities have a motorsport theme, although another derivation could be the representation of activities on a map or grid showing the age group on the X axis and level of time commitment required on the Y axis.
22 separate activities have achieved the Learning Grid quality standard, including Formula Student, F1 in Schools, Primary Engineer, Greenpower, STEM days and residential courses run by the Smallpeice Trust, the Shell Eco-marathon, F1 in Schools, the Engineering Education Scheme and The Year in Industry. Accreditation is valid for 3 years, with an annual review.
The Learning Grid has created a quality standard for engineering and science activities. Accredited programmes feature in a Guide published each autumn which is available to assist teachers in choosing suitable programmes for their pupils.

CATEGORIES: Algebraic number theory

In mathematics, a rigid analytic space is an analogue of a complex analytic space over a nonarchimedean field. They were introduced by John Tate in 1962, as an outgrowth of his work on uniformizing p-adic elliptic curves with bad reduction using the multiplicative group.  In contrast to the classical theory of p-adic analytic manifolds, rigid analytic spaces admit meaningful notions of analytic continuation and connectedness.  However, this comes at the cost of some conceptual complexity.

Archbishop James Morrison (July 9, 1861 – April 13, 1950) was the longest-serving bishop of the Diocese of Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. Although one of the last powerful and austere Roman Catholic bishops in Canada, Morrison presided over a diocese that created one of the most successful Catholic social movements in Canada. 
Morrison strictly adhered to the statutes of the Roman Catholic faith. Extremely skeptical of debt, he was cautious in all matters relating to church finances.  As Bishop of Antigonish he gained the ire of Rev. James Tompkins and other priests for refusing to allow St. Francis Xavier University to join a non-denominational university in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Although highly respected by the Catholic community, his cautious and frugal nature did not always foster tranquility.

[[On Translating Homer]]
CATEGORIES: History of translation, Translation publications, Books of literary criticism, Works by Matthew Arnold, 1861 books, Homer

On Translating Homer, published in January 1861, was a printed version of the series of public lectures given by Matthew Arnold as Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 3 November 1860 to 18 December 1860.
Arnold's purpose was to discuss how his principles of literary criticism applied to the two Homeric epics and to the translation of a classical text. He comments with disapproval on John Ruskin's 1860 review article "The English translators of Homer" in the National Review. He gives much space to comparing and criticising already-published translations of the epics, notably
He adds polite comments on William Maginn's Homeric Ballads (which first appeared in Fraser's Magazine, where Arnold intended to publish these lectures).
Arnold identifies four essential qualities of Homer the poet to which the translator must do justice: that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble 
After a discussion of the meters employed by previous translators, and in other existing English narrative poetry, he argues the need for a translation of the Iliad in hexameters in a poetical dialect, like the original. He notes the German translations of the Iliad and Odyssey into hexameters by Johann Heinrich Voss. He quotes English hexameter translations of short Homeric passages by himself and by E. C. Hawtrey and also surveys original English hexameter poetry, including
Arnold reserved much space for the criticism of the recently published translation of the Iliad into a ballad-like metre by F. W. Newman. Newman took offence at Arnold's public criticism of his translation, and published a reply, Homeric Translation in Theory and Practice. To this Arnold in turn responded, with a last lecture, given at Oxford on 30 November 1861, afterwards separately published in March 1862 under the title On Translating Homer: last words.

This dialect was traditionally known as Mappila Bashe because of Bearys' close contact with Mappilas. Due to the intensive influence of Tulu for centuries, it is today considered as a language close to both Tulu and Malayalam.On hearing it for the first time, a Malayali from Kasaragod district will feel some similarity to their language but not to a South Kerala Malayali.

[[Panodorus of Alexandria]]
CATEGORIES: Byzantine historians, 5th-century historians, 5th-century Egyptian people, Egyptian Christian monks, 5th-century Christians

Panodorus of Alexandria was an Egyptian Byzantine monk, historian and writer who lived around 400.
He introduced a world era calculation, who reckoned 5,904 years from Adam (in Greek "από κτίσεως κόσμου", "apo ktiseos kosmou" or "έτος κόσμου", "aetos kosmou", that is 'since world's creation' or "Anno Mundi") to the year 412 CE, about which time he lived. This era is usually termed the Antiochian, sometimes the Alexandrian era. Its new year was also transferred to September 1, in which case the eight latter months of its year 5493 are the eight former months of the year one of our chronology. More important than this is the Byzantine World Era, which long served as the standard of computation in the Eastern Empire, in Russia, among the Albanians, Servians, and Modern Greeks. It counts sixteen years in excess of the Antiochian era, though likewise beginning the year with September 1; its year 5509 began with September 1 of the year one before Christ. This era was in use in Russia until 1700; whence it originated appears not to be known.New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, vol. 4., p. 163, article "Era" http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc04/htm/ii.v.htm By the 10th century, this dating system (its beginning fixed at 5509 BCE) became standard in the Byzantine Empire and thereby, the Orthodox countries of Eastern Europe. But as such Anno Mundi time systems became very popular, they created a huge problem: end-of-world fever, caused by a threatening Seventh Day that equated to the end of the 6000-year period and corresponded to a date 500 years after Christ's birth year. So many Chiliasm, or Millenarianism, emphasizing religious movements arose at that period. In 1492, Sir Thomas Browne supported also the belief that the world was created in 5509 BCE and that its ordained lifetime was 7,000 years.

Dalai Lama Renaissance is a feature length documentary film, produced and directed by Khashyar Darvich, and narrated by actor Harrison Ford. The film documents the Dalai Lama's meeting with the self-titled "Synthesis" group, made up of 40 Western "renaissance" thinkers who hope to use the meeting to change the world and resolve many of the world's problems. The meeting took place at the Dalai Lama's home in Dharamsala, India in September, 1999.
The film won 12 awards, was the official selection in over 40 international film festivals, and played in cinemas in over 100 cities in the U.S., as well as other countries in the world like Germany, Austria, Switzerland.
It was also released in theaters in Taiwan in June 2009. The film received positive front page Chinese language press in Taiwan. However, the People's Daily presented an article criticizing the film.http://www.prweb.com/releases/Dalai/Lama/prweb2690094.htm
Among the Western thinkers who meet the Dalai Lama are: quantum physicist Fred Alan Wolf, social scientist Jean Houston, and founder of Agape International Spiritual Center church in Los Angeles, Dr. Michael Beckwith.
Through the film the audience sees the clash of egos that soon developed among the members of the group and their assistants, as each member attempts to mold the meeting to fit their own personal expectations[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]. Ultimately they discover they can't hope to change the world until they undergo a personal transformation. Assisted by the often light-hearted musings of the Dalai Lama, each member comes away uniquely changed by their experience[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl].
The film includes original music by Tibetan musicians.

The Hartmann Neuron was an electronic musical instrument designed and built by industry designer Axel Hartmann of the German company Hartmann Music in the years 2001–2005. The Neuron synthesizer used an Artificial Neural Network to create a digital computer model from sampled sounds, implementing a new synthesis technology which was developed by Stephan Bernsee at Prosoniq. This computer model could then be used to resynthesize a new sound, giving the player control over "musical" aspects such as instrument body size, material and other acoustic properties. This parametric approach is very different from the more mathematical approaches of other synthesizers.

Watsessing Avenue (also known as Watsessing) is a New Jersey Transit station in Bloomfield, New Jersey, along the Montclair-Boonton Line. It is located beneath the Bloomfield Police Benevolent Association meeting hall (which formerly served as the station building) near the corner of Watsessing Avenue and Orange Street in Bloomfield. It is one of two stations on the line where the boarding platform is below ground level (the Glen Ridge Station, two stops away from it, is the other). The Watsessing station and the Kingsland station in Lyndhurst on the Main Line shared similar designs (both station platforms are located below street level) and were built about the same time.
The current Glen Ridge, Bloomfield and Watsessing stations along the Montclair branch were all built in 1912 during a grade separation program by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. During New Jersey Transit's running of the line, two stations between Watsessing and Newark Broad Street were closed due to low ridership—the Roseville Avenue station in Newark, at the junction with the Morristown Line on September 16, 1984,[tpl]cite book|title=Morris & Essex Lines Timetable|publisher=New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|location=Newark, New Jersey|year=1984|edition=September 16, 1984[/tpl] and Ampere Station in East Orange on April 7, 1991.[tpl]cite book|title=Morris & Essex Lines Timetable|publisher=New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|location=Newark, New Jersey|year=1991|edition=April 7, 1991[/tpl] The word "Watsessing" is a Native American term that translates to "mouth of the creek".
The station has been on the New Jersey State Historic Preservation Office listings since March 25, 1998, the last of the four stations from East Orange to Glen Ridge to receive the listing. On September 14, 2005, the entire Montclair Branch was added to the same listings, although Ampere, Bloomfield and Glen Ridge stations have been on the listings since March 17, 1984.[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:wHfOXkSYtvUJ:www.state.nj.us/dep/hpo/1identify/lists/essex.pdf+watsessing+avenue+station+nj&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg6n4C6Dcaxyhdi_vUE9iTvS2xElapWvRup_rM3bXMHZeh10gY0ktiJElt2brTarQ5bQM4sDAvJBto1Lf4nRSKoxBOy0CLMe_aeljm-vo35aJuMMKwprVbQ0PhDj5yQBDLe4uMG&sig=AHIEtbQftWSt7lWmPuMdhMvBg69I6EV_hg|title= New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places – Essex County|page=1|publisher=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|author=New Jersey State Historical Preservation Office|accessdate=July 25, 2010|date=April 1, 2010[/tpl]

Upon its opening on February 27, 1981, Bay Street was a lone platform with a single shelter. In 2002, as part of the Montclair Connection, Bay Street was completely rebuilt to standards for handicapped persons, including two high-level platforms and a new elevator for a bridge crossing the tracks. The station also received honors in July 2010 for the development around the station and as a result was a part of getting Montclair designated a transit village by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

The Battle of Phước Long was a decisive battle of the Vietnam War which began on December 12, 1974, and concluded on January 6, 1975. The battle involved the deployment of North Vietnam's 4th Army Corps for the first time, against determined units of the South Vietnamese Army in Phước Long in Bình Phước Province near the Cambodian border (to be distinguished from the other Phước Long in Bạc Liêu Province, south of Saigon), under the command of Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống.Spencer C. Tucker Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War Oxford
On December 12, 1974, the North Vietnamese 4th Army Corps launched their campaign against Phuoc Long aiming to achieve three key objectives. Firstly, North Vietnamese leaders wanted to test the reaction of the United States Government, to see if they would actually uphold former President Richard Nixon's promises of military retaliation against North Vietnam. Secondly, North Vietnamese field commanders wanted to test the combat readiness of the South Vietnamese Army. And thirdly, the North Vietnamese wanted to solve their logistical problems once and for all, by capturing the district of Phuoc Long and the important transportation routes around it.Stanley Karnow, 1997
The North Vietnamese campaign proved to be a major success, because the fall of Phuoc Long showed that the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War was truly over, especially when the United States Congress repeatedly voted against additional aid for South Vietnam. Militarily, the victory at Phuoc Long also enabled the North Vietnamese to expand their logistical routes from the Central Highlands of South Vietnam to the Mekong Delta, which placed enormous pressure on the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

Montclair Heights Station is a New Jersey Transit station in Montclair, New Jersey along the Montclair-Boonton Line. The name of the station comes from the nearby community, which consists of parts of both Montclair and neighboring Clifton that share the Montclair Heights name.
Montclair Heights is also the highest station in Montclair by elevation, at approximately [tpl]convert|365|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level, and is along the First Watchung Mountain, two blocks from Mills Reservation, a park on the top of the mountain.
Depending on from where one takes the train, it is either the first or last stop of the six train stations in Montclair. The station is mile point 14.9 on the line.  The station is between 36 and 53 minutes away from New York Penn Station, depending on how many stops the train makes, and between 35 and 45 minutes from Hoboken.  The station is located on Normal Avenue at Carlisle Road, near the southwestern corner of Montclair State University's campus, and has several signs located trackside that call the station "Home of Montclair State University".
Prior to the construction of the Montclair State University station, Montclair Heights was used as a transfer station for trains heading west towards Dover and Hackettstown on the Montclair-Boonton Line. The reason for this was that all trains going to points north of the station were required to be diesel-powered, while trains going to New York Penn Station have to be electric because of problems with diesel fumes in the tunnels under the Hudson River.
This station is accessible with a part of its platform raised and having a ramp leading up to it.

Females are included in the list where appropriate; however, although the Crown could pass through the female line (for example to the House of Dunkeld in 1034), in the early middle ages it is doubtful whether a queen regnant would have been accepted as ruler.

Montclair State University Station at Little Falls is a New Jersey Transit rail station in the Great Notch area of Little Falls, New Jersey on the Montclair-Boonton Line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainSchedulesFrom&selStation=38081|title=Station Information: Montclair State University|publisher=New Jersey Transit|accessdate=2009-07-07[/tpl] The station, which opened on October 20, 2004, is located on Clove Road near Route 46 and the Montclair State University campus, and was built at a cost of [tpl]US$|26 million[/tpl], following the completion of the Montclair Connection. Although the station itself was not officially open, a temporary platform was built to allow the under-construction station to serve one of its main purposes as the Montclair-Boonton Line's primary transfer station.
On weekdays, every train on the Montclair-Boonton Line stops here.  Midtown Direct service to Penn Station terminates here, as the line west of the nearby yard is not electrified. The station is a major transfer point for riders because many trains terminate here, it is the first station on the line with service to New York Penn Station, and it is the first local stop of express trains. The station is a sheltered, two-tracked island platform with an elevated walkway over the tracks connecting it to the parking deck and the college campus. The station is equipped with ticket machines and monitors displaying arrivals and departures. It is accessible as the platform is fully elevated and elevators are available in addition to stairs. The station was intended to be a Park-and-Ride, near a highway and with a large parking deck.
There is no connecting bus service directly to the station, as the university's bus stop is on the opposite side of campus near the Montclair Heights station. Campus shuttles, however, do serve the station.

[[Great Notch (NJT station)]]
CATEGORIES: Railway stations opened in 1891, Railway stations closed in 2010, New Jersey Transit stations, Transportation in Passaic County, New Jersey, Stations along Erie Railroad lines

The Great Notch train station, formerly known as Caldwell Junction, was a small New Jersey Transit facility in the Great Notch section of Little Falls, New Jersey. The station was served seven times a day, three inbound morning trains to Hoboken Terminal and four outbound evening trains from Hoboken by the Montclair-Boonton Line from Monday to Friday. Located at the intersection of Notch Road and Long Hill Road, it was the second of three stations in Little Falls, the other two being Montclair State University and Little Falls, and was the first on the line to be strictly served by diesel trains. However, most trains bypassed this station and continued on to Little Falls (westbound) and Montclair State University (eastbound). The station was served by a single track with an unused side track. The last trains stopped at the station on January 15, 2010, at 7:41pm.
Train service at Great Notch originated in 1891, when the Caldwell Railway opened, serving Great Notch, Overbrook Hospital, Verona, and Caldwell. The station at Great Notch was first constructed in 1905 as a double station building for the Erie Railroad. The station was a green and red building serving the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, along with the Caldwell Branch. The station also used an old boxcar as a tool shed for maintenance. By the early 1970s, the station had fallen into disrepair, and by 1974, was repainted Erie Railroad-style red with the tool shed box car removed. The station was abandoned when the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad went out of business and was later picked up by New Jersey Transit. After making deals with the mayor of Little Falls, New Jersey Transit gave the station a one year "trial" to attract ridership. Ridership went down, however, and so the trial was canceled on December 18, 2009. The town of Little Falls was contacted by New Jersey Transit at that time, reporting that the Great Notch Station would be closed on January 17, 2010 due to the "anemic" ridership at the station.

Oleg Vasilyevich Koshevoy ([tpl]lang-uk|Олег Васильoвич Кошoвий[/tpl], translit. Oleh Vasyl'ovych Koshovyi; [tpl]lang-ru|Олег Васильевич Кошевой[/tpl]) (June 8, 1926 – February 9, 1943) was a Ukrainian Soviet partisan and one of the founders of the clandestine organization Young Guard, which fought the Nazi forces in Krasnodon during World War II between 1941 and 1945.
Born in Pryluky, a city in the Chernihiv Oblast (province) of present-day north-central Ukraine (at the time a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), Oleg Koshevoy's family moved south to Rzhyshchiv and Poltava before settling in Krasnodon (at the eastern border of Ukraine) in 1940, where he attended secondary school. In July 1942, Krasnodon was occupied by the German army. Under the leadership of the party underground, Koshevoy organized an anti-nazi Komsomol (Communist Youth) organization called the Young Guard ([tpl]lang-ru|Молодая гвардия[/tpl], translit. Molodaya gvardiya), becoming its commissar. In January 1943, the Germans exposed the organization. Oleg Koshevoy tried to cross the front line, but was soon apprehended. He was tortured and then executed on February 9, 1943.
On September 13 of 1943, Oleg Koshevoy was posthumously awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin, and later, the Medal "Partisan of the Patriotic War" 1st class . Many mines, sovkhozes, schools, and Young Pioneer groups in the Soviet Union were later named after him.

The station opened in January 2008 and has 1,000 parking spaces.New Wayne/Route 23 Transit Center Opens January 12, 2008 New Jersey Transit intends for this combined rail and bus station to become an "interceptor station," that will help relieve the habitual congestion at the West Belt Road Interchange, where the three major highways meet. In addition, the construction of the station was meant to also ease the congestion at what was then Route 23 Park & Ride, a bus depot on Route 23 North that has since been renamed Mother's Park & Ride, and the Willowbrook Mall Park & Ride; the now-Mother's site had limited parking while NJT was having trouble with overfull parking areas at Willowbrook.
The Wayne Township bus garage is located on the opposite side of Route 23.  There has been a proposal to build a parking deck with another thousand spots and develop the land at the station.
In addition to Montclair-Boonton trains, the Transit Center is served by the following New Jersey Transit bus lines:

[[Peer mentoring]]
CATEGORIES: Educational psychology, Mentorships, Peer learning

Peer mentoring is a form of mentorship that usually takes place between a person who has lived through a specific experience (peer mentor) and a person who is new to that experience (the peer mentee). An example would be an experienced student being a peer mentor to a new student, the peer mentee, in a particular subject, or in a new school. Peer mentors are also used for health and lifestyle changes. For example, clients, or patients, with support from peers, may have one-on-one sessions that meet regularly to help them recover or rehabilitate. Peer mentoring provides individuals who have suffered from a specific life experience the chance to learn from those who have recovered, or rehabilitated, following such an experience. Peer mentors provide education, recreation and support opportunities to individuals. The peer mentor may challenge the mentee with new ideas, and encourage the mentee to move beyond the things that are most comfortable. Most peer mentors are picked for their sensibility, confidence, social skills and reliability.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bozeman |first1=B. |last2=Feeney |first2=M.

Towaco Station is a New Jersey Transit station in the Towaco section of Montville, New Jersey along the Montclair-Boonton Line.  The station was renovated in the late 1990s.  The railroad line is currently just one main track, but operated as many as four tracks in the 1920s for transport of eastbound coal and goods.  The railway bridges over US 202 in the Towaco area initially carried the four tracks.  The general incline of the track in this area is an eastward downhill grade.
The station was built by the DL&W in 1910-11 as a concrete facility, replacing the old "Whitehall" stop, which was renamed Towaco in 1905.[tpl]cite book|last=Yanosey|first=Robert J.|title=Lackawanna Railroad Facilities (In Color)|publisher=Morning Sun Books Inc.|location=Scotch Plains, New Jersey|year=2007|volume=1:Hoboken to Dover|pages=52–53, 80|isbn=1-58248-214-4[/tpl]
In this area, the Morris Canal paralleled the railroad from Boonton to Towaco to Lincoln Park until its abandonment in 1925.  Considerable evidence of the Canal is visible along US 202.  These include the towpath and canal bed. An inclined plane for canal boats was used along US 202 farther south, between Lake Valhalla Road and the Montville Inn.

CATEGORIES: Lists of anime episodes

This is a list of episodes for the Mushishi anime series. It premiered on October 22, 2005 in Japan, but after 20 episodes, the series went on hiatus, and resumed screening the six remaining ones on May 14, 2006. Each episode tells a self-contained story and is not dependent on prior episodes for background. This made it possible for the producers of the anime to change the relative order of the stories. However, aside from a slight abridgment of the dialogue, this is the only major difference between the manga and the anime.
A special OVA series was released in January 4, 2014 and a second series started airing on April 4, 2014.

Beautiful Sin is a European power metal band. They are heavily influenced by the popular power metal band Helloween. 
Beautiful Sin began when Uli Kusch met a Belgian singer called Magali Luyten, and wanted to record an album with her band. He agreed to produce a demo-CD for the band, but the recordings were never released.
A few years later, Uli was considering creating a new project next to Masterplan in which he would write all the music himself. In autumn of 2004 he began talking to Magali once again – this time about forming a band together.
Rounding out the rest of the line-up would be Pagan's Mind's Jørn Viggo Lofstad and Steinar Krokmo (coming from Uli's adopted home, Norway), and also Kusch's Masterplan-mate, Axel Mackenrott.
After the release of The Unexpected, Carl Johan Grimmark was added as a second guitarist.

Pre-packaged curry powder of Indian origin is sometimes also referred to as yellow curry in Western countries but is a different blend of spices from Thai yellow curry.
Thai Yellow curry, outside Thailand, usually refers to the Thai-Muslim dish kaeng kari.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] This curry is richer and creamier than other Thai curries, since coconut cream is used in addition to coconut milk. This richer curry tends to tone down the overall spiciness of the dish, hence its popularity on menus outside of Thailand.  The primary spices in kaeng kari are cumin, coriander, turmeric, fenugreek, garlic, salt, bay leaf, lemongrass, cayenne pepper, ginger, mace and cinnamon. Sometimes a touch of palm sugar or a similar sweetener will be added, depending on the sweetness of the coconut milk.
Thai yellow curry can be made with duck, chicken, shrimp, fish or vegetables and is eaten with steamed rice[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thai-recipes-today.com/thai-yellow-curry.html |title=Authentic Thai Yellow Curry with Chicken |publisher=Thai-recipes-today.com |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2013-11-25[/tpl] or round rice noodles known as khanom chin.

[[Lundy pony]]

CATEGORIES: Horse breeds, Horse breeds originating in England, Lundy

The Lundy Pony is a breed of pony first developed on Lundy Island in England. The breed originated in 1928, when the owner of the island, Martin Coles Harman, introduced 34 New Forest pony mares, eight foals and a Welsh Mountain B strawberry roan stallion. Diana Keast, his daughter, explained why he chose to cross these breeds: “He wanted ponies with a bit of style and height.  Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies were nearer and more convenient - after all he had to charter a special train to bring the ponies from Lyndhurst - but they wouldn’t have had the height he wanted.” The Welsh stallion died only a year after arriving on the island, having sired just one foal - a colt called Pepper.  Luckily this first “Lundy pony” grew into an upstanding stud stallion, creamy dun with a black mane and tail.  By the Thirties there were so many ponies roaming the island that about 50 were rounded up and sold on the mainland.  During the war there was no way of shipping ponies from the island and the herd reached nearly 100.  There was constant warring among the entire stallions so that in 1944 a number had to be put down.
The pony herd was moved from the island in 1980 and taken to Cornwall, where it continued to breed. Some were also taken to New Devon. In 1984, the Lundy Pony Breed Society formed to oversee the breed. The Society later decided to return some of the mares and foals to the island of Lundy.
Due to the harsh environment of the island, with its poor vegetation and severe weather, the ponies grew to be incredibly tough and hardy. They typically are dun, roan, palomino, bay, or liver chestnut in color, and rarely exceed 13.2 hh in height. The ponies have a wide, deep chest, sloping shoulder, and hard, sound legs. Their necks are usually well-set and muscular and their backs strong and compact. Lundy Ponies are useful as mounts for children, as they are both attractive animals and good natured.

The Canadiens were substitute NHL representatives, as the final series to decide the NHL champion was not played.
The Cougars were the last non-NHL team to win the Cup as the WCHL (renamed the Western Hockey League for the 1925–26 season) folded after the 1926 Cup Final, leaving the Stanley Cup to become the NHL's de facto championship trophy.  The Cougars would also be the last team based west of Chicago to win the Cup until the Edmonton Oilers won the trophy in 1984.

Hidden Valley Resort (also known as HV) is a holiday resort in Huntsville, Ontario, Canada, about 225 kilometers (140 mi) north of Toronto. It is situated on one shore of Peninsula Lake, which is also home to the nearby Deerhurst Resort.
Hidden Valley is currently operated by Sequel Hotels and Resorts – previous owners include Best Western and Holiday Inn – who, in early 2006, completed a C$500,000 renovation project."New Name and Look for Hidden Valley Resort", The Huntsville Forester, 7 June 2006. Retrieved on 2006-07-04 Along with a 100-room four-star resort hotel, Hidden Valley boasts two pools (one indoor and one outdoor), a fitness centre and meeting rooms; a variety of water sports on the lake, which include windsurfing, canoeing, kayaking, pedal boats, and swimming; tennis courts, beach volleyball and horseshoe pits; Birches, a value-priced restaurant, focusing on creativity; and an expansive sandy beachfront.
The resort also includes three rows of townhouse-style, semi-detached condominium blocks (making up approximately 80 units in total). Each block contains up to four single residences, which are stacked into four-storey buildings, other than the lakefront properties. Each individual unit generally occupies two storeys of a building, and has its own entrance. While the condominium units share the same amenities with the patrons of the hotel complex, these units are no longer owned by the hotel, but rather are privately owned and rented.
During the winter months (December–March, as conditions allow), the Hidden Valley Highlands Ski Area, established in 1965, is open for downhill and cross-country skiing and snowboarding. The region has a maximum vertical drop of 327 ft (100 m), with a top elevation of 1,276 ft (390 m). The area consists of four ski lifts and thirteen trails – four rated Green Circle (beginner), four Blue Square (intermediate), three Black Diamond (advanced), and two Double Black Diamond (expert). As well, there are locations for tobogganing and ice skating, and snowmobile trails available.
Nearby attractions include 36 holes of championship golf at the Deerhurst Lakeside and Deerhurst Highlands golf courses, and Algonquin Park.

[[Forward surgical teams]]
CATEGORIES: Military medical organizations of the United States, United States Army medical facilities, Military medicine

US Army forward surgical teams (FST) are small, mobile surgical units fielded since the 1990s. FSTs are utilized in a variety of ways, and can be attached to a Forward Support Medical Company (FSMC), Area Support Medical Company (ASMC), Brigade Medical Company also known as C-Med or in some cases stand alone (with appropriate support) to provide a surgical capability for those patients unable to survive MEDEVAC to a Role 2 or 3 (hospital) care. Surgeons perform hemorrhage control on combat casualties within the "golden hour" of injury.  Casualties can then be packaged for medical evacuation to a higher level of care. The FST typically includes 20 staff members: 4 surgeons, 3 RNs, 2 certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), 1 administrative officer, 1 detachment sergeant, 3 licensed practical nurses (LPN)'s, 3 surgical techs and 3 medics.
By doctrine, given in Field Manual 4-02-25 (March 2003) and ARTEP 8-518-10, the team is capable of continuous operations with a divisional or non-divisional medical company for up to 72 hours with a planned caseload of 30 critical patients. The FST can sustain surgery for 24 total operating table hours and has the ability to separate into two teams that function independently. A functional operating room can be established within one hour of being on scene and break down to move to a new location within two hours of ceasing operations.  
FSTs are currently deployed in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

[[Federal intervention]]
CATEGORIES: Government of Argentina, Argentine law, Federalism

Federal intervention ([tpl]Lang-es|Intervención federal[/tpl]) is an attribution of the federal government of Argentina, by which it takes control of a province in certain extreme cases. Intervention is declared by the President with the assent of the National Congress. Article 6 of the Argentine Constitution states:
 
 The federal government intervenes in the territory of the provinces to guarantee the republican form of government or to repel foreign invasions, and upon request of its authorities created to sustain or re-establish them, if they have been deposed by sedition or by the invasion of another province.

Upon intervention, the branches of the provincial government are dissolved, and the federal government must appoint a new authority (called interventor) who will serve for a short term until the situation is normalized.
The most recent example of intervention took place in 2004, when President Néstor Kirchner applied it in the province of Santiago del Estero after a wave of grave accusations against governor Mercedes Aragonés de Juárez and her husband, the local caudillo Carlos Juárez.

The park's site was given by Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani, and lies southeast of downtown Hilo, on the Waiakea Peninsula in Hilo Bay. Much of the park now consists of Edo-style Japanese gardens, built in the early 1900s, and said to be the largest such gardens outside Japan. The gardens contain Waihonu Pond as well as bridges, koi ponds, pagodas, statues, torii, and a Japanese teahouse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.downtownhilo.com/Places/LiliuokalaniParkandGardens/tabid/419/Default.aspx |title=Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani Park and Gardens |publisher=downtown Hilo Association web site |accessdate=2013-03-02 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091217161744/http://www.downtownhilo.com/Places/LiliuokalaniParkandGardens/tabid/419/Default.aspx#dnn_ctr911_dnnTITLE_lblTitle |archivedate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Close to this park is the small island called Moku ola, (also known as Coconut Island), connected to the park by a footbridge. It is a good place for a picnic, and some limited swimming. The name Moku ola literally means "island of life" in the Hawaiian language, since it was site of an ancient temple dedicated to healing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ulukau.org/cgi-bin/hpn?e=q-0mahele--00-0-0--010---4----dtt--0-0l--1en-Zz-1---20-about-mokuola--00031-00010escapewin-00&a=d&c=mahele&cl=search&d=HASH01f6f34fd282d21d593797fb |title=lookup of mokuola |accessdate=2009-10-12 |work=Hawaiian Place Names web site |publisher=University of Hawaii |author=Lloyd J.

[[Confiscation Act of 1861]]
CATEGORIES: Political history of the American Civil War, 1861 in the United States, 1861 in law, 37th United States Congress

The Confiscation Act of 1861 was an act of Congress during the early months of the American Civil War permitting court proceedings for confiscation of any of property being used to support the Confederate independence effort, including slaves.
The bill passed the House of Representatives 60-48 and in the Senate 24-11. Abraham Lincoln was reluctant to sign the act; he felt that, in light of the Confederacy's recent battlefield victories, the bill would have no practical effect and might be seen as a desperate move. He was also worried that it could be struck down as unconstitutional, which would set a precedent that might derail future attempts at emancipation. Only personal lobbying by several powerful Senators persuaded Lincoln to sign the legislation, which he did on August 6, 1861.Donald, David Herbert. Lincoln. (1995) p. 314  Lincoln gave Attorney General Edward Bates no instructions on enforcing the bill. Few confiscations occurred. 
With respect to slaves, the act authorized court proceedings to strip their owners of any claim to them but did not clarify whether the slaves were free.McPherson, James. Battle Cry of Freedom. (1988) p. 356 As a result of this ambiguity, these slaves came under Union lines as property in the care of the U.S. government. In response to this situation, General David Hunter, the Union Army military commander of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida, issued General Order No. 11 on May 9, 1862 freeing all slaves in areas under his command. Upon hearing of Hunter's action one week later, Lincoln immediately countermanded the order, thus returning the slaves to their former status as property in the care of the federal government.[tpl]cite book| last = Linfield| first = Michael| title = Freedom Under Fire: U.S. Civil Liberties in Times of War| url = http://books.google.com/?id=ta2kvLpA3BoC&pg=PA23| year = 1990| publisher = South End Press| isbn = 978-0-89608-374-5| pages = 23, 30-32 [/tpl]
Before the act was passed, Benjamin Franklin Butler had been the first Union general to declare slaves as contraband. Some other Northern commanders followed this precedent, while officers from the border states were more likely to return escaped slaves to their masters. The Confiscation Act was an attempt to set a consistent policy throughout the army.

[[Canadian Land and Emigration Company]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct companies of Ontario, History of Ontario, Haliburton County

In 1859, the Crown Lands Department in Province of Canada advertised a block of land for sale in (what is now) Haliburton County. The purpose for the sale of the land was to promote rapid settlement of the newly created townships in the district through private enterprise. The townships included in the sale were Dysart, Dudley, Harcourt, Gilford, Harburn, Bruton, Havelock, Eyre, Clyde, and Longford. In 1861, the land was purchased by a group of gentlemen from Great Britain, charted as follows:
The first Chairman of the Company was Thomas Chandler Haliburton, whose name was given to the first village to be established within the company’s lands and later to the County of Haliburton.
Lengthy negotiations were carried on between the  Company, and the Department  of Crown Lands concerning the selection of townships and the terms of sale. The Department agreed to pay for the survey of the outlines of the townships, but the Company had to pay for the survey within the townships and their subdivision into lots. 
Brookes Wright Gossage with other surveyors under his direction began work in the townships of Dysart and Longford. At first, Gossage was in partnership with John Stoughton Dennis and later with Vernon B. Wadsworth. As many as sixty or seventy men were employed on the project at one time, and large sums of money were required for wages and provisions. Although the Company had to pay for all the land except swamp. When the survey was completed it showed [tpl]Convert|403125|acre|km2[/tpl] in the ten townships of which 41,000 deducted as swamp, leaving [tpl]Convert|362125|acre|km2[/tpl] to be paid for at 50 cents per acre.
From the outset the Company had difficulty in selling the lands. The distance of the townships from the settled parts of the province, the absence of good roads, the rough nature of the country, the Civil War in the United States, the Fenian raids on the border, and rival attractions of Western Canada, all combined to discourage sales.
From 1863 to 1870, a large number of emigrants came to settle in the region. By 1871, the Company had sold [tpl]Convert|16650|acre|km2[/tpl] to settlers and a number of town lots to various purchasers. Most of the company’s profits were realized from the sale of timber. In 1872, the Company built a road between the villages of Kennaway and Haliburton. Also, the Company contributed greatly to the cost of the connection of a telegraph line to Haliburton. In 1877, the Company contributed to the construction of the Victoria Railway from Kinmount to Haliburton with the hopes of increasing settlement in the townships. 
By 1883, the Province of Ontario had begun to open up neighbouring townships of Haliburton and Muskoka with offers of free land grants, the Company found settlers were even more reluctant to purchase Company lands. The Company was unable to cope with this competition. As a result, it was decided to offer for sale its complete holdings and undertakings in Canada. The Company was purchased by W.H. Lockhart Gordon and James Irwin on April 11, 1883. Mr. Irwin had previously been involved in lumbering in the area, beginning in 1877.
On April 10, 1889, Letters of Patent were issued by the Province of Ontario incorporating the new Canadian Land and Immigration Company, of Haliburton Limited. From 1890 to 1897 little activity took place. Sales of land and timber cutting right had practically ceased. In 1895, Mr. Irwin declared bankruptcty and the bank (most likely the Canadian Bank of Commerce) took possession of his rights and interest in Haliburton, which included Irwin's shares in the new Company. During the 1920s the Company sold the entire township of Bruton to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario and proceeds from the sale allowed the Company to buy back from the bank the timber cutting rights previously licensed to Irwin. 
During the depression, lumbering activities ceased once again, but as more roads were constructed, the region began to develop as a tourist and vacation area, and land sales began to increase. At the outbreak of World War II, lumbering activities intensified, and carried on into the post-war years. By the end of 1946, all of the land originally purchased by the Company had been sold. The Canadian Land and Immigration wound up its affairs, surrendered its charter, and ceased to exist. 
Of the ten townships purchased by the Company, Longford was located in the County of Victoria, while the others were then a part of Peterborough County.  These, along with other townships of Peterborough County, Victoria County and Nipissing District, were incorporated as the Municipality of Haliburton in 1874, which became Haliburton County. The Municipality of Dysart et al., include townships of Dysart, Dudley, Harcourt, Guilford, Harburn, Bruton, Havelock, Eyre and Clyde, formerly belonging to the Canadian Land and Emigration Company Limited.

CATEGORIES: 1892 births, 1981 deaths, French composers, Musical hoaxes, Historicist composers

Marius Casadesus (October 24, 1892 – October 13, 1981) was a French violinist and composer. He was the brother of Henri Casadesus, uncle of the famed pianist Robert Casadesus, and grand-uncle to Jean Casadesus.
Marius Casadesus achieved perhaps his greatest fame (or notoriety) through his association with the so-called "Adélaïde Concerto" attributed to Mozart. This concerto was published in 1933 in a piano transcription under Mozart's name, with Casadesus as "editor." Many music scholars believed in its authenticity, and Yehudi Menuhin made a recording of the concerto. It was even given a place in the Köchel-Verzeichnis (the standard catalog of Mozart's works), albeit as "K. Anh. 294a." ("Anh." denotes "Anhang" or "appendix" to the catalog.) However, Mozart collector Alfred Einstein's doubts about this piece were confirmed when Casadesus later admitted his authorship in court in 1977 during a copyright dispute.
Casadesus' brother Henri was also a noted author of musical hoaxes, such as "Handel's Viola concerto in b-minor" and "J.C. Bach's Viola Concerto in c-minor."
Casadesus is also known for having given the first recital of Ravel's "Tzigane" in the presence of the composer in Barcelona.

[[Dodge Charger R/T (1999 concept)]]
CATEGORIES: Rear-wheel-drive vehicles, Full-size vehicles, Sedans, 1990s automobiles, Dodge concept vehicles

In 1999 Dodge debuted a new Dodge Charger R/T concept car. It took many styling cues from the 1960s Chargers (most notably the second generation) but also had four doors. The designers attempted to blend the rear doors into the design so they would not be noticed very easily. Compressed natural gas was purported as being in the lineup for a possible fuel source.
The concept Charger R/T, while sharing the long nose and rearward cab of the original, was a good deal shorter. It was [tpl]convert|187|in|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in overall length compared to [tpl]convert|203|in|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] for the 1966 Charger. It was also lighter; [tpl]Convert|3000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl] versus [tpl]Convert|3650|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
While making an important statement for CNG technology, the Charger R/T was equally appealing to the design community. It had functional side scoops, as does the Dodge Viper, and the chrome plated, central mounted exhaust was somewhat reminiscent of the Viper. It even has functional air exhausters sculpted into its rear fascia.
The Charger R/T was equally important for what it said about CNG technology. The concept car showcased a new storage tank system that one day might deliver [tpl]Convert|300|mi|km[/tpl] range in a CNG-powered passenger car and not compromise storage space in the trunk.
The cylinders, or pressure cells, inside the fiberglass storage tank were lined with a gas-impermeable high density polyurethane (HDPE) thermoplastic and wrapped in a hybrid mix of high-strength carbon and super-tough glass filaments that were wound with an epoxy resin. Finally, the cylinders were laid into a foam egg crate to absorb impacts. It was strong for its weight, resistant to environmental damage, reliable and durable. The tank can be made flat, in the shape of a conventional gasoline tank, yet the fuel can still be stored at 3600 lb³ of pressure.
While the concept car was not placed into production, a new Dodge Charger (LX) was produced in 2005 for the 2006 model year. Although built on the same Chrysler LX platform as the concept car, the new Charger bears little resemblance to the 1999 concept, nor the 2nd generation Chargers that inspired the concept car.
The car was featured in the video game Midnight Club III: DUB Edition.

[[Grasstrack]]
CATEGORIES: Track racing, Sports originating in the United Kingdom

Motorcycle Grasstrack is a form of motorcycle racing which typically, in its current form,  takes place on a flat track consisting of two straights and two bends usually constructed in a field. Mountain and hillside tracks are also common in the UK, creating more technically demanding circuits. It is one of the oldest types of motorcycle sports in the UK with the first meetings having taken place in the 1920s. Postwar grasstrack circuits included "permanent" venues such as Brands Hatch and Mallory Park which were not simple oval shapes, although solo motorcycle races were run in an anti-clockwise direction. Later, these were converted into tarmac circuits with races using the more common clockwise direction associated with modern roadracing. Competitors of the postwar era included now-famous names such as Bernie Ecclestone and Murray Walker. In the modern era, it is generally similar to Speedway with races usually taking place over 4 laps from a standing start. Unlike Speedway, which has 4 riders per race, Grasstrack  racing can have many riders in each heat and the circuit is normally longer allowing higher speeds. Grasstrack has three solo classes, 250 cc, 350 cc and 500 cc together with three sidecar classes; left-handed 500 cc and 1000 cc (turning left) and right-handed 1000 cc (turning right).
Many famous Speedway riders such as 1976 world champion Peter Collins started their racing careers in Grasstrack. Some Speedway riders continue to take part in national Grasstrack meetings when their schedule permits.
The British Grasstrack season usually starts in early spring around the Easter holidays and runs through the summer/autumn months. More spectacular racing takes place at larger roped tracks including the Poacher and ASTRA Champion of Champions and Grand Slam meetings in Kent and in particular the most exciting meeting of all at the famous Rhodes Minnis circuit.
The pinnacle of the domestic Grasstrack season is the British Masters Championships. This official ACU championship is where the British champion is crowned in the mainstream 500 cc solo and 1000 cc right hand sidecar classes. The current British Masters champions are Andrew Appleton (500 cc solo) and Mark Cossar/Carl Blyth (1000 cc RH Sidecar).
In Europe the same sport is often called Long Track racing. This is exactly the same setup as British grasstrack which has tracks normally around 600–800 meters in length, but is held on the continent with tracks up to 1000–1200 meters in length and with speeds reaching 90 mph – 100 mph. The machinery used is the same as are the riders.

Wallasea Wetlands is a reclaimed wetlands area located in Essex, England. It has been created as part of a government-funded wetlands scheme to halt the decline of wild and endangered birds caused by the drainage and development of former wetland sites. It is the largest man-made marine wetland area in the United Kingdom.
The wetland spans an area of 115 hectares and is sited on Wallasea Island, which borders two rivers (River Crouch to the north and River Roach to the south-east). They provide winter grounds for wading birds, as well as breeding and nursery areas for aquatic wildlife, such as bass, mullet, flatfish and herring and even some types of dolphin. The area will also help to reduce the flooding of properties near the River Crouch by providing a run-off area for floodwaters.
In the process being termed "managed re-alignment", the seawall that protects croplands and property was re-established in more tenable positions, three miles behind the new wetlands, which will provide habitat for birds like oystercatchers, avocets and little terns, according to the press release issued at the time.
Walkers and birdwatchers will be able to enjoy the scenery by means of a new footpath that has been built on the top of this new relocated sea wall.
Construction was completed in 2006, and by 2011, the land will have naturally evolved into wetland, mudflats, saline lagoons and seven artificial islands, allowing the wildlife to reside on these areas.

The Colonizer and the Colonized ([tpl]lang-fr|Portrait du colonisé, précédé par Portrait du colonisateur[/tpl]) is a well-known nonfiction book of Albert Memmi, published in French in 1957 and in English at first in 1965.
This work explores and describes the psychological effects of colonialism on colonized and colonizers alike. Dissecting the minds of both the oppressor and the oppressed, Memmi reveals truths about the colonial situation and struggle that are as relevant today as they were five decades ago.
When it was published in 1957, many national liberation movements were active. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote the preface. The work is often read in conjunction with Frantz Fanon's Les damnés de la Terre (The Wretched of the Earth) and Peau noire, masques blancs (Black Skin, White Masks) and Aimé Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism.
Several decades later, Memmi published a follow-up book called Decolonization and the Decolonized.

Yusef Hawkins (also spelled as Yusuf Hawkins, March 19, 1973 – August 23, 1989) was a 16-year-old African American who was shot to death on August 23, 1989 in Bensonhurst, a predominantly Italian-American working-class neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.  Hawkins and three friends were attacked by a crowd of 10 to 30 white youths, with at least seven of them wielding baseball bats. One, armed with a handgun, shot Hawkins twice in the chest, killing him.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref]
Hawkins had gone to Bensonhurst that night with three friends to inquire about a used 1982 Pontiac automobile that was for sale. The group's attackers had been lying in wait for either black or Hispanic youths they believed were dating a neighborhood girl.  Innocently, the victim, Mr. Hawkins, and his friends, walked onto the ambushers' block.    After the murder of Mr. Hawkins, police said that he was not in any way involved with the neighborhood girl whose honor the killers were, wrong-mindedly, protecting.
Hawkins' death was the third killing of a black man by white mobs in New York City during the 1980s; the other two victims were Willie Turks, who was killed on June 22, 1982 in Brooklyn, and Michael Griffith, who was killed in Queens on December 20, 1986. The incident uncorked a torrent of racial tension in New York City in the ensuing days and weeks, culminating in a protest march through the neighborhood led by the Reverend Al Sharpton.

[[Irish involvement in the Spanish Civil War]]

CATEGORIES: Spanish Civil War, Military history of Ireland, History of the Republic of Ireland

The Spanish Civil War lasted from July 17, 1936 to April 1, 1939. Both sides in the Spanish Civil War attracted participants from Ireland.
Eoin O'Duffy formed a corp of 750 who supported General Francisco Franco's Nationalists, aided and abetted by Irish Roman Catholic clergy, who reacted to the extensive massacre of Catholic clergy by the Republicans (see Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War)). 
The International Brigade, which comprised individuals from Britain, the United States and France, were supported by 320 Irish men, a quarter of whom were killed in action.  Some were involved with underground unions, some were opposed to O'Duffy's Blueshirts and Greenshirts in Ireland, while others believed that fascism threatened Ireland.  Following the death of Michael O'Riordan in Dublin on May 18, 2006, Bob Doyle was the last Irishman alive to have fought for the International Brigade until his death on the 23rd January 2009. Paddy Cochrane,Paddy Cochrane at the Ireland and the Spanish Civil War site who served as a medic, died on 31 March 2011 aged 98, the last Irish non-combatant.
Frank Ryan was another leading Irish participant on the Republican side.  Despite his deafness in late 1936 Frank Ryan travelled to Spain with about 80 men he had succeeded in recruiting to fight in the International Brigades on the Republican side. Ryan's men are sometimes referred to as the "Connolly Column". 
He served in the Lincoln-Washington Brigade rising to Brigadier. He fought in a number of engagements until he was seriously wounded in March 1937, and returned to Ireland to recover. He took advantage of the opportunity of his return to launch another left-republican newspaper, entitled The Irish Democrat. On his return to Spain, he again served in the war until he was captured by Italian "volunteer" troops fighting for the Nationalists in March 1938. He was accused of murder, court-martialled, and sentenced to death before being incarcerated in Burgos Prison in 1938. His sentence was later commuted to thirty years hard labour in January 1940.

There have been four creations of the title Baron Lumley, all in the Peerage of England:
The first creation was in 1384 for Sir Ralph Lumley but after being beheaded by the citizens of Cirencester for his part in the Epiphany Rising, he was posthumously attainted and his title forfeit.
The next creation was in 1461 for the grandson of the first baron, Sir Thomas Lumley in 1461. Shortly after, he obtained a reversal of his grandfather's attainder and presumably became the 2nd Baron Lumley of the 1384 creation also. Upon the death of the 5th/4th baron in 1545, the title was forfeit due to the opposition of his son, George, to the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
The third creation was in 1547 for George's son, Sir John, who managed to be restored in the blood, but the title became extinct upon his death without children in 1609.
The final creation was in 1681 for Richard Lumley, 2nd Viscount Lumley (a cousin of the last baron) who was later created Earl of Scarbrough in 1690. The barony and earldom remained united to the present day.

Jethro Exum Sumner ([tpl]circa[/tpl]1733 {–} [tpl]circa[/tpl]March 18, 1785) was a North Carolina landowner and businessman, and an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.  Born in Virginia, Sumner's military service began in the French and Indian War as a member of the state's Provincial forces. After the conclusion of that conflict, he moved to Bute County, North Carolina, where he acquired a substantial area of land and operated a tavern.  He served as Sheriff of Bute County, but with the coming of the American Revolution, he became a strident Patriot, and was elected to North Carolina's Provincial Congress.
Sumner was named the commanding officer of the 3rd North Carolina Regiment of the North Carolina Line, a formation of the Continental Army, in 1776, and served in both the Southern theater and Philadelphia campaign.  He was one of five brigadier generals from North Carolina in the Continental Army, in which capacity he served between 1779 and 1783.  He served with distinction in the battles of Stono Ferry and Eutaw Springs, but recurring bouts of poor health often forced him to play an administrative role, or to convalesce in North Carolina. Following a drastic reduction in the number of North Carolinians serving with the Continental Army, Sumner became a general in the state's militia but resigned in protest after the North Carolina Board of War awarded overall command of the militia to William Smallwood, a Continental Army general from Maryland.  After the end of the war in 1783, Sumner helped to establish the North Carolina Chapter of the Society of the Cincinnati, and became its first president.  He died in 1785 with extensive landholdings and 35 slaves.

[[Lord of Lorne]]
CATEGORIES: Lordships of Parliament

For the child ballad, see The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward.
Lord of Lorne is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created twice. First it was created for Robert Stewart, son of John Stewart, ambassador to the English king, by a daughter of Eoghan de Ergadia, Laird of Latharna. He was succeeded by his oldest son John, member of the Scottish Parliament. In 1463 the second lord died and his younger brother William became 3rd Lord Lorne. William Stewart resigned the lordship on 30 November 1463 and was created 1st Lord Innermeath on the same day. The next creation was for Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, the husband of Isabelle Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Lord Lorne and niece of William Stewart, 1st Lord Innermeath, in 1470.
The Mormaerdom or Kingdom of Lorne was a lordship in High Medieval Scotland.

Aloysius Joseph "Allan" Travers, aka Rev. Aloysius Stanislaus Travers (May 7, 1892 – April 19, 1968) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who made a one-game appearance during the 1912 strike of the Detroit Tigers. 
Travers was only playing because the Detroit Tigers team had refused to play after their team mate Ty Cobb had been suspended for attacking a heckler who called him a "half-nigger" during a game against the New York Yankees at Hilltop Park three days earlier.
Travers does not, as is often reported, hold the major league record for most hits or runs allowed in a game, although he does hold the major league record for earned runs in a single major league game.  The Cleveland Blues' Dave Rowe, who was primarily an outfielder, gave up 35 runs (12 earned) on 29 hits in a game played on July 24, 1882.  Travers does hold the two negative records for American League play.

Mark Anant Wagh (born October 20, 1976) is a former English cricketer who played for Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire. He attended King Edward's School, Birmingham where he played alongside Anurag Singh, in the year group team two years above his own (one year above Singh's). 
Having originally played first class cricket for Oxford University, captaining them in 1997 and playing against opposing captain and friend Anurag Singh in the annual Varsity Match (cricket), he made his debut for Warwickshire in the same year. He received his county cap in 2000, and was selected for the England A tour of Australia in 2001 after hitting a massive 315 at Lord's in the county season. However, whilst fellow Academy member and teammate Ian Bell has gone on to an extended England career, Wagh has not since been called up, barring an inclusion in a preliminary squad for the ICC Champions Trophy in 2004.
Whilst Wagh is principally considered a batsman and opened for Warwickshire in first class and limited overs cricket, he is also a useful off-spinner, with career best figures of 7-222 against Lancashire in 2003. This followed a ban in 2000 after his action was reported for throwing. Since then, he has more than once closed out close games for the club with his bowling.
Having missed the whole of the 2005 season after a serious knee injury, Wagh featured in Warwickshire's first team during 2006 after strong performances in the Twenty20 season, promoted following injury to Warwickshire teammate, Nick Knight. At the end of 2006, despite having two years remaining on his Warwickshire contract, the county allowed him to move to Nottinghamshire.

[[Strong Angel]]
CATEGORIES: Disaster preparedness

Strong Angel is an informal consortium of agencies and organizations that have together hosted a series of international disaster response demonstrations leveraging public-private collaboration within a complex disaster response scenario. Since 1999 the Strong Angel series has focused on field experimentation within very challenging environments, testing the use of cutting-edge techniques and technologies to facilitate more effective humanitarian response.
The name for the event, Strong Angel, was chosen to recognize two important influences in the humanitarian response sector. The first was "Operation Sea Angel" in 1991, an impromptu rescue operation led by General Henry Stackpole leading a US Navy Amphibious Task Force in urgent response to an un-named cyclone in Bangladesh. That rescue operation is generally credited with saving up to 200,000 lives and stimulated the entire field of research around complex operations in humanitarian response. The second influence was the insightful DARPA Program Manager responsible for the original civil-military integration concept, Dr. Gary Strong.
There are several specific sectors tested in each Strong Angel event, with the general goals of (1) improved information flow, (2) the provisioning of urgent and sustainable critical services, and (3) trans-boundary cooperation, all in the aftermath of a disaster. The Strong Angel demonstrations are broadly international in nature, with more than 15 nations participating in 2006, and the ethos of the demonstration is "radical inclusion" on the supposition that good ideas can come from anywhere - and especially from within the communities most at risk.
Everything created by any Strong Angel event is released to the public domain. Demonstrations have been held in 2000, 2004, and 2006, with the next scheduled for Baja California, Mexico in October 2014 (see below).

The Caspian is a small horse breed native to Northern Iran. Although its original height probably ranged between [tpl]hands|9|and|11.2[/tpl] it is termed a horse rather than a pony because, size apart, it has much in common with horses. It is believed to be one of the oldest horse or pony breeds in the world, descended from small Mesopotamian equines that, in competition with larger animals, had faded from attention by the 7th century AD.  They were brought to public notice again when re-discovered in 1965 by Louise Firouz, an American-born breeder of Iranian horses living in Iran. In 2011, the remains of a horse dating back to 3400 B.C.E. were found at Gohar Tappeh, Iran, giving rise to claims that the Caspian is the oldest known breed of domestic horse that still exists.The Circle of Ancient Iranian Studies.

John of Procida ([tpl]lang-it|Giovanni da Procida[/tpl]) (1210–1298) was an Italian medieval physician and diplomat. 
He was born at Salerno, educated in the Schola Medica as a physician. He was a noted physician for his age and received at professorial chair at this university.  He came to the attention of Frederick II, who was patron of the university, and he eventually became Frederick's personal physician and attended him to his death.Runciman, p. 224. He was also personal physician to Cardinal John Orsini, the future Pope Nicholas III.  Being noticed for his intelligence and pragmatism, he rose through the diplomatic ranks in the Hohenstaufen Kingdom of Sicily. He was actually John III, son of John II of Procida and Clemenza Logoteta, of the family of the lords of the island of Procida. 
He was originally a counsellor of Frederick II of Sicily and was entrusted with the education of Frederick's son Manfred. He was at Manfred's side until his defeat at the Battle of Benevento in 1266. In that year he went to Viterbo, Italy and arranged the marriage of his daughter to the Neapolitan Guelph, Bartholomew Caracciolo, and then served with the Hohenstaufen army. After the defeat of the Hohenstaufens at Tagliacozzo he escaped to Venice. His estates were confiscated by Charles; and his wife and daughter were mistreated or raped by the French knight sent to evict them and one of his sons murdered.Runciman, p. 224 In 1269 or 1270 he was in Germany trying to drum up support for the return of the Hohenstaufen to the throne of Sicily. While existing Sicilian legends overplay John of Procida's role in the dramatic politics of this time, Runciman concurs that he was at the centre of a "vast political conspiracy" in support of the House of Hohenstaufen (backed by the Byzantines and their Genoese allies) and against Charles of Anjou and his ally the Pope.Runciman, p. 226
In 1279 and 1280 John (or, as Runciman argues, one of his sons at his behestRunciman, p. 229) travelled to Sicily to stir up the discontents in favour of Peter and thence to Constantinople to procure the support of the emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus. Michael refused to aid the Aragonese king without papal approval and so diplomatic efforts turned to Rome, where he gained the consent of Pope Nicholas III, who feared the ascent of Charles of Anjou in the Mezzogiorno. John of Procida then returned to Barcelona. The result of these travels was to link Byzantine gold and Genoese assistance behind Aragonese ambitions in Sicily. Through John's secret diplomatic actions the conditions were set for the 1282 uprising of the Sicilian Vespers which destroyed Charles' crusading invasion fleet (aimed first at recapturing Constantinople) at anchor in Messina, providing the conditions for the security of Constantinople and the ability of Peter III to recover the island.  
On 2 February 1283, Peter, who had invaded Sicily in the wake of the Vespers uprising, nominated John as Grand Chancellor. He was put in charge of the island when Peter went to France to take up a challenge by Charles later that year. All this did not stop the aged diplomat from continuing his frenetic activity at the varied courts of Europe's monarchs. It was on one of these trips that he died, at Rome, at the age of eighty-eight years, in 1298. 
The legacy of John of Procida is controversial. Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia, a Sicilian-language tract from 1290, lauds him highly. He is more typically portrayed, particularly by Guelph partisans, as cospiratore contro l'autorità costituita, a "conspirator against the constitutional authority", as in the Tuscan Liber Jani de Procida et Palialoco, which presents him in negotiations with Michael VIII, and in the Leggenda di Messer Gianni di Procida, written by a Modenese Guelph. His reputation has experienced a bit of a rehabilitation and he has been called one of the first politicians and diplomats in the modern senses of the terms. Clearly his diplomatic role was important: the Sicilian uprising began the War of the Sicilian Vespers, the "world war" of the 13th century, a key event in the subsequent history of Europe.
According to legend, he was in Naples incognito on 29 October 1268, when they executed Conradin. He supposedly recovered the guanto di sfida (gauntlet) Conradin threw into the crowd before his execution.

José Gregório (died 1961) was a Portuguese glassmaker in Marinha Grande, a center of the glass industry in the country, a trade unionist and a member of the Portuguese Communist Party. He became notable for being one of the leaders of a major riot in his hometown against the dictatorial regime in 1934.
During the 1930s, the Party was the major force in the resistance against the dictatorial regime led by António de Oliveira Salazar. After the approval by the government of a law forbidding the free trade unions, several strikes and riots began all over the country. In Marinha Grande, the workers, in a riot led by the Gregório and other members of the Party, controlled the entire town. Only a massive intervention by the military ended the strike.
In 1938, Gregório was arrested by the PIDE, the political police, and was tortured for several times during his imprisonment. Released in 1940, Gregório had an important role in the reorganization of the Party in the early 1940s. In 1943, he became a member of the Party's secretariat and presented reports related to the Party's work among the trade unions in the 3rd and 4th congresses.
José Gregório died in 1961, after living more than 20 years clandestinely, due to the persecution of the political police.

CATEGORIES: Areas of Northampton

Abington is a district of the town of Northampton, England, east of the town centre.
Originally a small village outside the borough boundary of Northampton, Abington is mentioned in The Domesday Book. In the 17th century the village was enclosed and depopulated. The outlines of the village's streets can still be seen as can the village's fishpond (although this is now a garden) in Abington Park. The park was given to the town by the Wantage family in the 19th century.
The area known as Abington became part of the borough of Northampton in the late 19th century as the town expanded. Its close location to Abington Park causes this to be a highly sought-after residential area. Abington has often been described as "the Greenwich Village of Northampton."[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
The Wellingborough Road (locally known as the "Welly Rd") passes through the centre of Abington containing many restaurants, pubs and supermarkets and is the heartbeat of the area. St Edmunds Hospital was once open on the Wellingborough Road before being closed in 1997 and demolished to make way for new development. Housing is mixed with former warehouses becoming converted flats, terraced housing and council housing.
Wantage Road in Abington is home to Northamptonshire County Cricket Club and was formerly the home of Northampton Town Football Club on Abington Avenue before the club moved to Sixfields in modern premises west of the town.

CATEGORIES: Ajax-class ironclads, Victorian-era battleships of the United Kingdom, 1880 ships

HMS ''Ajax was the first of the two Royal Navy Ajax'' class ironclad battleships to be laid down, but was completed one day later than her sister, [tpl]HMS|Agamemnon|1879|6[/tpl]. She carried her main artillery in centrally mounted turrets.
She was designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, working under strict Admiralty-imposed limitations, as a smaller and cheaper version of [tpl]HMS|Inflexible|1876|6[/tpl]; unfortunately the need, imposed by budgetary constraints, to produce a smaller ship produced a vessel with all of the shortcomings of Inflexible but with none of her virtues.
Her guns were of 12.5 inches calibre, the largest that could be accommodated on the displacement. They were carried in two double turrets mounted 'en echelon' in the waist of the ship. The intention was that, by being mounted off centre, one gun in each turret would be able to fire directly ahead or directly astern, thus allowing for at least two guns to be able to point on any bearing. In practice, firing close to the keel line caused significant blast damage to the superstructure, so in reality gunfire was limited to the broadside.
Ajax, and her sister Agamemnon, were the first British battleships to be designed without any sailing rig whatsoever.

Æthelstan (died c. 852), the eldest son of King Æthelwulf of Wessex, was the King of Kent from 839 under the authority of his father.Nelson, Æthelwulf The late D, E and F versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describe Æthelstan as Æthelwulf's brother, but the A, B and C versions, and Æthelweard's Chronicon, state that he was Æthelwulf's son.Stenton, p. 236, n. 1 Some historians have argued that it is more probable that he was a brother, including Eric John in 1966John, p. p. 41, n. 1 and Ann Williams in 1978.Williams, "Some notes", pp. 145, 225, n. 10 However, in 1991 Ann Williams described him as Æthelwulf's son,Williams, "Athelstan" and this is now generally accepted by historians, including Frank Stenton, Barbara Yorke,Yorke, p. 148 and D. P. Kirby.Kirby, p. 160
When Æthelwulf became King of the West Saxons in 839 on the death of his father, Egbert, he appointed Æthelstan to rule over Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex. He is styled king in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Æthelweard's chronicle calls him "King of the Dwellers in Kent, of the East Saxons, of the South Saxons and of Surrey". He attested a number of his father's charters as king in the 840s.
In 851, Æthelstan and Ealdorman Ealhhere defeated a Viking fleet and army at Sandwich, Kent, described by Frank Stenton as "the first naval battle in recorded English history".Stenton, p. 244 Ealhhere's death in battle against Vikings is recorded c. 853. Æthelstan is not mentioned after 851 and presumably died before Æthelwulf went to Rome in 855 as he was not included in arrangements for government of the kingdom during his father's absence.Keynes and Lapidge, pp. 69, 231-2, 235.

The department’s mission is to manage California’s working lands. It regulates oil, natural gas and geothermal wells; studies and maps earthquakes and other geologic phenomena; maps and classifies areas containing mineral deposits; ensures reclamation of land used for mining; and administers agricultural and open-space land conservation programs. A division within the department dedicated to encouraging beverage container recycling has been moved into the newly created Department of Resources Recovery and Recycling (CalRecycle). Despite the similar name, the Department of Conservation should not be confused with the California Conservation Corps, another department within the Natural Resources Agency, which provides work experience for young adults.

George William Daley (September 14, 1875 - August 12, 1952) was an American newspaper editor, sports writer, and syndicated author of fictional baseball stories and poetry The Stolen Base. He often used the pseudonym Monitor. Daley was born in Clinton Heights, Rensselaer County, New York and married Marion Rhines while a student at Union College in Schenectady, New York.
They had a daughter, Marjorie May, and settled in West Brighton, New York. It is there that he launched his newspaper career, initially at the Staten Islander and as the Staten Island correspondent for the New York World, 1895–1899, and later, the Brooklyn Eagle and the New York Sun. From 1900-1905 he created the popular Home Run Haggerty and Strike Out Sawyer fictional characters and launched his syndicated baseball stories.
Mr. Daley joined the New York Herald as a telegraph editor in 1905 and quickly worked his way up the ladder to night city editor, night editor, news editor and, ultimately, managing editor.
His failing health prompted his doctor to recommend a career change and so he rejoined the staff of the New York World as a sports writer where he chronicled the play-by-play and results of sporting contests from golf, cycling, collegiate football, yachting, tennis, boxing, horse-racing to, his favorite, baseball.
While at the World, his Monitor by-line headed regular weekly columns including Over the Plate and Sport Talk and he became a recognized authority on baseball, heading the New York Chapter of the Baseball Writers Association http://wwww.baseballwriters.org/.
When the World closed its doors in 1931, Mr. Daley went to work for The New York Times as a copy editor in the sports department until his death in 1952.

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Austin, Texas, National Register of Historic Places in Austin, Texas, Bakeries of the United States, Swedish-American culture in Texas

The Lundberg Bakery, also known as the Old Bakery and Emporium, is a historic bakery building currently serving as a gift shop in downtown Austin, Texas. The building was completed in 1876 and is located at 1006 Congress Avenue, half a block south of the Capitol grounds. At the time the bakery began operations, bread was not sold wrapped or packaged. People would wait in line with cloth lined baskets to place the bread in after buying it. Short story writer William Sydney Porter frequented the bakery as he passed it to and from work while employed at the General Land Office Building.
The building served as a bakery until its owner, Swedish immigrant Charles Lundberg, died in 1895. The building changed hands frequently until being bought and refurbished by the Austin Heritage Society in 1962. It was threatened with demolition in 1970, when a new building was planned for the Texas Department of Transportation, but saved when excavations next door uncovered the foundations of the previous state capitol building (a temporary structure built in 1882). Following the discovery, the foundations were converted to a historical plaza, and the bakery was saved.
The building is constructed of limestone with a brick facade, and features a large cast-iron eagle at the peak of the gabled roof overlooking Congress Avenue.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1969.

[[Engine One-Forty-Three]]

CATEGORIES: Carter Family songs, Johnny Cash songs, Songs about trains, Songs about West Virginia, Songs written by A. P. Carter, Summers County, West Virginia

"Engine One-Forty-Three" is a ballad in the tradition of early American train wreck songs, based on the true story of the wreck of the FFV near Hinton, West Virginia on 23 October 1890.  The train was on its way to Clifton Forge, Virginia, when it hit a rock slide.  Early accounts record that the engineer, George Alley, remained on the train to try to slow it and save the lives of its passengers.  Alley died at the scene, but the fireman is said to have jumped to safety.  The ballad elaborates the story, including a mother (not alive at the time of the wreck), excessive speed (a popular theme in train wreck songs), and a motive (a prior delay, and the engineer's wish to make up time on a train with a reputation for swiftness).[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=AY7St4-8x10C&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=george+allen+engine+143#PPA189,M1 | title = Long steel rail: The railroad in American folksong | isbn = 978-0-252-06881-2 | author1 = Cohen | first1 = Norm | last2 = Cohen | first2 = David | date = 2000-04-17[/tpl]
The author of the song is unknown, but is attributed amongst others to a worker at the Hinton rail yard and to a C&O engineer.  The best-known version of the song was written down by A. P. Carter and recorded by the Carter Family  either (or both) in 1927 (released on Victor 40089B (Smithsonian Collection of American Folk Music - Folkways) and/or February 15, 1929, released in 2009 on JSP Records 2001, JSPCD7701B. However, these may be the same recording. It is also available on the 1993 Rounder compilation My Clinch Mountain Home: Their Complete Victor Recordings (1928–1929). It is also the last song recorded by country music singer Johnny Cash in its entirety, according to his son John Carter Cash. 
 Cash performed the song for the tribute album The Unbroken Circle - The Musical Heritage of the Carter Family in 2004.

The Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) is a non-profit community arts center based in Venice, California. SPARC hosts exhibitions, sponsors workshops and murals, and lobbies for the preservation of Los Angeles-area murals and other works of public art. According to its mission statement, "SPARC espouses public art as an organizing tool for addressing contemporary issues, fostering cross-cultural understanding and promoting civic dialogue."
Inspired by the Mexican artistic movement that spread the social gospel of the Mexican Revolution through muralism, SPARC was founded in 1976 by muralist and activist Judy Baca, (who continues to serve as artistic director), painter Christina Schlesinger, and filmmaker Donna Deitch. It was an outgrowth of the "Friends of the Citywide Mural Program", a community organization dedicated to supporting Baca's work with the Los Angeles Citywide Mural Program, a city-funded project to beautify city walls and divert the energies of youth in gang-afflicted areas. The initialism "SPARC" was chosen intentionally, as the organization was intended to "spark" "a movement toward identity and justice."[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl]
In 1977, SPARC took up residence in a two-story Art Deco building that had served as the Venice jail since 1929. The SPARC building features a gallery, five artists' studios, a darkroom, and houses Baca's archives as well as those of Minna Agins.
SPARC's first project was the monumental mural project The Great Wall of Los Angeles, which is one of the largest murals in the world. It depicts scenes from the history of California on the side of the Tujunga wash, and was created by thousands of volunteers, most of them school-aged. Beginning in 1988, SPARC undertook a program called Great Walls Unlimited: Neighborhood Pride, which painted 105 murals in neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles.
The SPARC website hosts an archive of digital images of Los Angeles murals (currently in development), as well as a discussion forum.

Some were equipped with third rail shoes to enable entry into the underground tunnels approaching Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station in New York City. Turboliner service originally started in the 1970s as an effort by Amtrak to update its fleet with faster, more modern vehicles. Since then, the trainsets have undergone several rebuilds with the latest in 2000.  As part of a lawsuit settlement between Amtrak and New York State, no Turboliners are currently in revenue service and the partially refurbished fleet has been sold for scrap.

Adidas Predator is a range of football boots developed by German sportswear manufacturers Adidas based on a prototype concept from the Australian former footballer Craig Johnston.http://sneakerreport.com/features/the-complete-history-of-the-adidas-predator/http://www.thehardtackle.com/2013/craig-johnston-inventor-who-became-footballer/ The common feature of the Predator range is the presence of rubber patches or strips on the top of the shoe, designed to increase friction between the boot and the ball. In late 2010, Adidas designed the new "Power-spine" technology, which they claim improves shot power by reducing the amount the foot bends back as it kicks the ball.
In 2014 Hungarian inventor László Oroszi won a court case against Adidas in relation to the predator precision range.http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading-room/adidas-liable-for-patent-infringement-in-hungary[tpl]cite web|title=Az Adidas lenyúlta Oroszi László találmányát|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140211-pert-nyert-egy-magyar-feltalalo-az-adidas-szal-szemben.html|publisher=Origo|accessdate=02-11-2014[/tpl] forcing Adidas to pay royalties on that range of the boot.

[[Blackwood Detective Agency]]
CATEGORIES: Cthulhu Mythos organizations, Fictional agencies

The Blackwood Detective Agency is a fictional organization from the Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game.
It was presumably founded by Norman Harvey Blackwood Sr. in the beginning of the 20th century as a reaction to the rise of activity around the Cthulhu Mythos in Arkham. Soon an entire, worldwide network of intrepid investigators was created around it, with people from all walks of life from politicians to criminals that work together to stop the threat of the Mythos.
Most of the people that work in this network fall under the 'The Agency' faction; However, The Agency has strong ties with 2 allied factions 'The Syndicate' representing the criminal underworld and 'Miskatonic University' representing scientists investigating all aspects of The Mythos.
At the beginning of Arkham Edition set, Norman Harvey Blackwood Sr. is missing and his son, Norman Blackwood Jr., takes over his role, hoping to find out what happened to his father.
At the end of the Arkham Block, in the cardset 'Forbidden Relics' Norman finds his father. This, however, would not last. In the 'Eldritch Edition' block a new character is introduced, simply known as 'The Man,' who tries to influence all actions of the Blackwood Agency and their connections. He is introduced as an old friend of Blackwood Sr. 
Norman Jr. doesn't like or trust him though, and it is later revealed that The Man is an Avatar of Nyarlathotep, who tries to set up an intricate plan by infiltrating all of the game's factions.
Towards the end of the Eldritch Edition block, Blackwood Sr. disappears to the Dreamlands and gives up his life to find information about a place called Gray Dragon Island. Blackwood Jr. takes the Agency there, as well as Jack 'Brass' Brady from the Syndicate because they think the place must be really important if Blackwood Sr. would lay down his life to find the location.

Waleran (or Walram) I (died 1082), called Udon, was the count of Arlon from AD 1052 and Limburg from 1065. He was the son of Waleran, Count of Arlon. He was also the advocate of the abbey of Sint-Truiden.
The origins of his family are poorly known, he appears to have been a member of a collateral branch of the house of Ardennes, then ruling in Upper Lorraine. He may instead have been maternally related to that house. His mother may have been Adela, daughter of Duke Theodoric I.
He inherited Arlon together with his brother Fulk, who died in 1078, leaving him sole count. Waleran married Jutta, daughter of Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine. This marriage gave him the county of the Len (or Lengau), a district around Liège. Waleran constructed a castle in his new territory: the Lenburg, whence Limburg. Waleran made this castle his seat and he is known as the first count of Limburg. His son, Henry, inherited his counties on his death.

The OB•12 was the second and last Oberheim synth in whose creation had not been involved original Oberheim company founder Tom Oberheim, the first one being the Oberheim OB-Mx.
Despite a brilliant look, an advanced synthesis engine, numerous features, a great hands-on interface and a very particular sound, the instrument failed to gain musicians favour, mostly because of its "non-Oberheim Oberheim" status.[tpl]According to whom|date=June 2013[/tpl] Also, the synth earned a reputation for being unreliable, since early versions of OB•12 contained several bugs in the operating system software. Eventually, most of the bugs were rectified, but it was already too late to save the instrument's reputation, and it was discontinued, bringing an end to the Oberheim / Viscount "joint venture," and ultimately Oberheim itself.

The Acolhua are a Mesoamerican people who arrived in the Valley of Mexico in or around the year 1200 CE.Smith (1984, p.171), who arrives at this date by averaging six dates mentioned in early codices.   The Acolhua were a sister culture of the Aztecs (or Mexica) as well as the Tepanec, Chalca, Xochimilca and others.  
It is likely that the ruling family of the Acolhua were descended from Otomi speakers and did not speak Nahuatl until decreed by their ruler (tlatoani) Techotlalatzin.Davies (1980, p.129); Smith (1984, p.170). 
Under Techotlalatzin's grandson, Nezahualcoyotl, the Acolhua allied with the Mexica (Aztecs) in the Aztec Triple Alliance.  The Acolhua capital, Texcoco, became a cultural center of the resultant Aztec Empire.

[[DECtalk]]

CATEGORIES: DEC hardware, Speech synthesis

DECtalk was a speech synthesizer and text-to-speech technology developed by Digital Equipment Corporation in the early 1980s, based largely on the work of Dennis Klatt at MIT, whose source-filter algorithm was variously known as KlattTalk or MITalk.[tpl]cite journal |last=Klatt |first=Dennis |journal=The Official Proceedings of Speech Tech '87 |date=April 1987 |publisher=Media Dimensions/Penn State |location=New York |title=How Klattalk became DECtalk: An Academic's Experiences in the Business World[/tpl]
The first DECtalk units were seen in 1984.  They were standalone units that connected to any device with an asynchronous serial port.  These units were also able to connect to the telephone system by having two telephone jacks.  One connected to a phone line, the other to a telephone.   The DECtalk units could recognize and generate any telephone touch tone.  With that capability the units could be used to automate various telephone-related tasks by handling both incoming and outgoing calls.  This included acting as an interface to an email system and the capability to function as an alerting system by utilizing the ability to place calls and interact via touch tones with the person answering the phone.
Later units were produced for PCs with ISA bus slots.  In addition, various software implementations were produced, most notably the DECtalk Access32.  Certain versions of the synthesiser were prone to undesirable characteristics.  For example, the alveolar stops were often assimilated as sounding more like dental stops.  Also, versions such as Access32 would produce faint electronic beeps at the end of phrases.
In the final years of DEC, early/mid-2000,[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2000102600720PREM|title=AllLinuxDevices: Force to Support Linux On DECtalk TTS For Strongarm and Intel Devices |work=Linux Today |date=2000-10-26 |accessdate=2012-09-16[/tpl] the DECtalk IP was sold to Force Computers, Inc.

The DECtalk engine was notably used in the National Weather Service's first "Console Replacement System" (CRS) installations in the late 1990s for NOAA Weather Radio.  As of 2003 it had all but been replaced by a far more modern engine called Speechify.  The so-called "Perfect Paul" voice (a DECtalk "preset" for a default understandable male voice) still does Station identifications on many NWR stations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/nwrcrs.htm |title=NOAA Weather Radio Automated Voice and Programming |publisher=NOAA |location=USA |accessdate=2013-06-09[/tpl]
DECtalk can be used as part of a speech generating device for those unable to speak. A notable user is Stephen Hawking, who is unable to speak due to a combination of severe disabilities caused by ALS as well as an emergency tracheotomy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chninternational.com/stephen_hawking_and_als.htm |title=Stephen Hawking and ALS |first=Stephen |last=Hawking |accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl]  Hawking has used a version of the DECtalk voice synthesizer for several years[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=assistive-communication |title=Getting Back the Gift of Gab: NexGen Handheld Computers Allow the Mute to Converse |first=Larry |last=Greenemeier |work=Scientific American |date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl] and has come to be associated with the unique voice of the device.

A North Korean missile test occurred on May 29 and 30, 1993. North Korea fired a Nodong-1 missile into the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), from a base in Hwadae County near Wonsan, North Korea. The target was a buoy floating in the Sea of Japan. The North Koreans were testing the missile so they could export it to Iran in return for oil.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/world/missile-is-tested-by-north-koreans.html |title=Missile is Tested by North Koreans |first=David E. |last=Sanger |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 12, 1993 [/tpl]  Japanese and United States officials waited a few days before disclosing the launch of the missile.  Afterwards, North Korea reaffirmed its commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The missile launches were the culmination of several months' planning and bargaining with Iran, and what was suggested to be a plot between Iran and North Korea to develop weapons capable of striking Japan. It began in March 1993, with North Korea receiving several shipments of "special metals" designated for the construction of missile launch pads.CNS-Chronology of North Korea missile tests Later, a Russian report indicated that North Korea was in the market for "missile specialists" in order to turn their missile production into a more profitable venture. Russian officials were further incensed after detaining a group of Russian nuclear physicists and rocket scientists attempting to enter North Korea. North Korea later pledged not to use Russian scientists and technicians, after being threatened with cut diplomatic ties by Russia.
In January of that year, the commander of the Iranian Revolution Guard Corps, Mohsen Rezai, went to Pyongyang to finalize a 2.7 billion dollar purchase of around 300 Scud missiles from North Korea. Around the same time, the Iranian delegation came to watch the final Nodong-1 tests and North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It was suspected upon successful testing of the missiles, Iran intended to trade oil for the Nodong missiles, as Iran is a primary contributor of North Korea's oil (over 40%).

It is named for Walter Schmidt, Class of 1905, a benefactor to then-St. Xavier College who also donated money for Schmidt Hall (formerly the library, now the President's office) on campus.
It was the first on-campus arena for the university, and was in use from the last game of the 1928 season to 1983, when the team moved to the off-campus Cincinnati Gardens full-time.  (The team had played a few big games a year there, as well as Riverfront Coliseum, prior to that.)  Since 1983, the team has only returned once to the arena, for a game against Florida International University in January 1988.  
Currently the fieldhouse is used for the school's recreational sports program.  It has also hosted World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) events, and a speech by President Bill Clinton in 1996.

While studying under Dmitri Shostakovich at the Leningrad Conservatory (1939–1941), he began a one-act opera Rothschild's Violin based on Anton Chekhov’s short story about Bronza, a Russian country coffin-maker and violinist, and his combative relationship with the Jewish musicians in his village.
At the outbreak of World War II, Fleishman volunteered for the front and was killed before he could complete the work. In memory of his talented student, Shostakovich rescued the manuscript from besieged Leningrad, finished it and orchestrated it in 1943-1944. Shostakovich dated his completion of the score February 5, 1944. Later, he exerted influence so that the opera should be published and performed.
The opera's World Premiere concert performance took place on June 20, 1960, at the USSR Union of Composers, Moscow with the soloists and members of the Moscow Philharmonic Society. The opera was first staged in April 1968, Leningrad, at the Experimental Studio of Chamber Opera.

[[Panoram]]

CATEGORIES: Visual music, Art Deco

Panoram was the trademark name of a visual jukebox that played music accompanied by a synched, filmed image (the effect being the equivalent of today's music videos) popular within the United States during the  1940s. The device consisted of a jukebox playing a closed-loop 16mm film reel projected onto a glass screen.
The Panoram is now best known for the vast library of short, three minute music videos that were created for it. Called soundies, these films featured most of the great musical stars of the period, including Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Cab Calloway. Many of the filmed interludes survive and are considered a priceless archive.
The Panoram was priced more than $10,000 in 2006 dollars. It was generally seen in bars, cafes, and upscale dancing establishments where they ran as a curiosity. Following World War II, the device never recovered its previous popularity due to competition from television.
The Soundies were printed backwards (mirror image) so that they would appear in a correct orientation when played in a Panoram machine. A Panoram was the size of a refrigerator and employed a series of mirrors to reflect the image from a projector onto a 27-inch, rear-projection, etched-glass screen in a tight, enclosed cabinet. The popular machines were first produced in 1939 by the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago, Illinois, (which also made art-deco, fancy slot machines) and found their way into countless soda shops, taverns, bus and train stations and other public places across the nation. The specially made 16mm films ran in a continuous loop and stopped when a notch cut in the film allowed a micro switch to engage a step-back relay at the end of a Soundie. The patron then put another dime in the machine to run the series of eight 2- to 3-minute films again. The Panoram mechanics were housed in an Art Deco, high quality wood cabinet, the Soundies being 3½ minute films that typically showed jazz and other musicians of the day, as well as dance troupes and other acts. With the beginning of World War II, production of the Soundies and Panoram machines was drastically reduced due to a wartime raw material shortage and the Mills Panoram's 1940 success quickly faded.

The name is appropriate as, in some spots, the sun only reaches the floors of the deep gorges of the national forest when directly overhead at midday. The Spanish Conquistador Hernando de Soto explored the area in 1540, as did William Bartram in the 18th century. The Nantahala River flows through the Nantahala National Forest.

Boon Bun, in Hebrew: יוסי ברבי בון, read as Yossi BeRabbiof Rabbi Bon) was a Jewish Talmudist, known as an amora of the fifth generation (4th century CE) who lived in the Galilee in the Land of Israel. He was the son of Rabban Abin IBacher, "Ag. Pal. Amor." iii. 724. and the teacher of Abin II.Yerushalmi Nedarim 3b. He was at first the pupil of Rabbi Jose of Yodqart, but the latter's indifference to his own family caused Jose to leave him and follow Assi.Ta'anit 23b; Weiss, Dor, iii. 117. Jose was the most important among the last Halakhists of the amoraim of the Land of Israel. He had a thorough knowledge not only of the Judean customs and halakhot, but of the Babylonian, a fact that has led some scholars to maintain that Jose must have resided at some time in Babylonia. It is probable, however, that he derived his knowledge of Babylonian teaching from his father, who had traveled in Babylonia.
Jose's chief work in the field of the Halakhah was the expounding of the Mishnah and the halakhot of the Amoraim, though some halakhot are credited to him. In aggadah he excelled in the transmission and elucidation of the sayings of his predecessors, especially those of Hiyya, Joshua ben Levi, Yohanan and Simeon ben Lakish.
His chief halakic opponents were Mana II and Jose ben Zebida.

Note that the date of death & age at death are wrong here.) was one of the founding fathers of Leamington Spa in Warwickshire, England. Satchwell's cottage was in the old town to the south of the River Leam. He was the village's first postmaster, using his cottage as the post office,Hembry, Phyllis May: "The English Spa, 1560-1815: A Social History", page 291.

In 1777 he helped set up The Foundation of Hospitality, a savings scheme which helped the poorer people of the village get medical attention.
In 1764 he married Mary Whitmore with whom he had 11 children: Hannah, Elizabeth, David, William, Elizabeth, Anne, Joseph, Kezia, George & Pheobe.Parish records.
On 14 January 1784 Satchwell made the discovery that he would be remembered for. Until that date there was only one known spring in Leamington, on land belonging to the 4th Earl of Aylesford, who refused to sell the water (which was used for bathing and medicinal purposes), instead allowing people to have it for free. However in 1784 Satchwell and his friend William Abbotts found a second spring and in the manner of the time used its supposed medicinal qualities to make money from the leisured classes.
After Satchwell and Abbotts' spring was found several wells were bored and water was drawn. Leamington quickly grew into one of the most fashionable spa resorts of the 19th century, a process which turned it from a sleepy village to a thriving town.
In 1806 Satchwell founded the Leamington Spa Charity, with the assistance of Reverend James Walhouse. The charity was to help the sick poor, who were to provide a certificate of need from a respectable person or parish officer, entitling them to a weekly lodgings allowance of 5s, subject to medical supervision. Money was raised from hotels and subscriptions, with Satchwell both the secretary and treasurer until his death in 1810.Hembry: "The English Spa" page 291 He was also well known for his poetry, which he wrote and performed. He died of a chest condition and was buried in Leamington's parish church, All Saints on 4 December 1810, just yards from where his friend Abbotts had been laid to rest four years earlier. Two years after his death, Satchwell was to be honoured as a 'patron and friend' of the town, given a raised tomb fit for a nobleman or gentleman in the churchyard of All Saints.

Jeff Lane Penn was a representative rugby football player for Taranaki (1957–1963) and Wairarapa-Bush (1965–1966), and coach of a highly competitive Wairarapa Bush side 1983-1987.  He has been employed as All Black selector 1988-1991, and as president of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union 2001-2003.
Lane Penn was born in Stratford, New Zealand, and received his secondary education at New Plymouth Boys' High School.  He was selected for Taranaki while still at school, and played more than 50 games from 1957-1963.  He moved to the Wairarapa, and played 12 games for the provincial side there 1965-1966.
After coaching the Wairarapa-Bush club side Gladstone to a club championship, he took over the job of coaching of the Wairarapa-Bush from Sir Brian Lochore in 1983.  He was successful at maintaining a highly competitive provincial team against all the odds, and the team regularly hit the headlines with outstanding performance against the larger unions of the country.  All Blacks Brett Harvey and Brent Anderson were among the team's stand-out players.
In 1988 Penn’s efforts were recognized and he was appointed All Black selector.  Over the next few years Penn coached the New Zealand Development team, New Zealand Marist and divisional sides on overseas tours, and no national team that he coached ever tasted defeat.  Penn was employed as assistant coach to Alex Wylie, and served on various NZRFU committees and judiciary panels.  He was a member of the selection panel which chose John Hart as All Black coach.
In 2001 Penn was elected President of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union for a two-year term, and was a strong advocate for the resourcing and encouragement of grassroots and provincial rugby in New Zealand.
Lane Penn is married to Jill, and farms in Opaki near Masterton.

[[World Series television ratings]]
CATEGORIES: World Series lists, Major League Baseball television ratings, ABC Sports, CBS Sports, Major League Baseball on Fox, NBC Sports

This is a list of television ratings for Major League Baseball's (MLB) World Series since 1984. Only United States audience totals are included, not Canadian television ratings, although the 1992 and 1993 World Series were highly watched in Canada. 
The most watched World Series game in history was Game 7 in 1986, as the New York Mets defeated the Boston Red Sox at Shea Stadium in New York City. The game had a 55% share. This broke the record established two nights before in which 52% of televisions in use in the US were tuned in to see the Mets' famous Game 6 comeback that forced a Game 7.
The least watched World Series game in history was in 2008, as only 9.8 million people watched the third game of the series between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Tampa Bay Rays; a rain delay moved the start of the game to after 10 p.m. on the East Coast with the game not ending until 1:47 a.m. It had an all-time low rating of 6.1, matched later by Game 3 in 2012 between the San Francisco Giants and the Detroit Tigers.[tpl]cite news|title=World Series has record-low rating|date=October 29, 2012|work=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8570950/world-series-averages-record-low-television-rating|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BoBSPTmy|archivedate=October 30, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]

[[Borhyaenidae]]

CATEGORIES: Sparassodonts

The borhyaenids, members of the metatherian family Borhyaenidae (probably not true marsupials, but sister taxa to them; see Sparassodonta), were a carnivorous group of otter/wolverine-like mammals in the order Sparassodonta. Like most metatherians, they had a pouch to carry their offspring around. Borhyaenids had strong and powerful jaws, like those of Hyaenodon and Andrewsarchus, for crushing bones. They grew up to 5 or 6 feet long. Borhyaena was a  member of this group.
Originally, the Borhyaenidae was one of the most expansive groups of sparassodonts, including all species not originally included in the Thylacosmilidae. However, in recent years, with the elevation of most sparassodont subfamilies to family rank and the discovery that borhyaenids are more closely related to proborhyaenids and thylacosmliids than other sparassodonts, the family has been reduced to six species in three genera.[tpl]cite journal| title=Osteology of Arctodictis sinclairi (Mammalia, Metatheria, Sparassodonta) and phylogeny of Cenozoic metatherian carnivores from South America|first=Analía M.|last=Forasiepi|journal=Monografías del Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales|year=2009|volume=6|pages=1–174| url= http://www.academia.edu/4908872/Osteology_of_Arctodictis_sinclairi_Mammalia_Metatheria_Sparassodonta_and_phylogeny_of_Cenozoic_metatherian_carnivores_from_South_America[/tpl]
Borhyaenids are best known from the early Miocene of South America, particularly from fossil sites in the southernmost part of Patagonia. Although some Oligocene basal borhyaenoids were once considered to be borhyaenids, the group is now considered restricted to the Miocene. The fossil record of this group after the early Miocene is rather poor, and only fragmentary remains attest to their presence in the late Miocene. However, the only confidently identified late Miocene borhyaenid specimen[tpl]which|date=December 2013[/tpl] comes from a site which is known to have early Miocene fossils mixed in with late Miocene ones, and so it may be that this group did not survive the end of the early Miocene.[tpl]cite journal| title=Taxonomic revision of Parahyaenodon argentinus Ameghino and its implications for the knowledge of the Mio-Pliocene large carnivorous mammals of South America|first=Analía M.|last=Forasiepi|author2=Agustin G.

[[Bessie Anderson Stanley]]

CATEGORIES: Writers from Kansas, Year of birth uncertain, 1952 deaths, 1879 births

Elisabeth-Anne "Bessie" Anderson Stanley (1879–1952Old Poetry: Success) is the author of the poem Success (What is success? or What Constitutes Success?), which is often incorrectly attributedSuch as in this memorial: Max Kreger, a memorial, Sandusky District Library, Sandusky, Michigan to Ralph Waldo Emerson"What Constitutes Success": A $250 Prize Story by a Lincoln Woman Lincoln Sentinel, November 30, 1905 (archived by Bill and Diana Sowers on Lincoln County, Kansas Genealogy & History website)In Search of Success, extensive research by Dirk H.

Her poem was written in 1904 for a contest held in Brown Book Magazine,''The Truth behind the Poem "Success" (email exchange between Robin Olson and Bethanne Larson, Stanley's great-granddaughter, on "Robin's Web" website) by George Livingston Richards Co. of Boston, Massachusetts  Mrs. Stanley, of Lincoln, Kansas, submitted the words in the form of an essay, rather than as a poem.  The competition was to answer the question "What is success?" in 100 words or less.  Mrs. Stanley won the first prize of $250."Bessie Stanley's Famous Poem"
Written in verse form, it reads:
The poem was in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations in the 1930s or 1940s but was mysteriously removed in the 1960s. It was again included in the seventeenth edition.  However, it does appear in a 1911 book, More Heart Throbs, volume 2, on pages 1–2.Grosset & Dunlap of New York, ©1911 by Chapple Publishing Company Ltd. of Boston, MA (from Success: Finding a Gem among the Litter in the Literature, Chuck Anastasia, Coolspark blog, February 24, 2007)
Ann Landers (and her sister Abby) are also said to have misattributed the poem to Emerson and her concession to a public correction is in The Ann Landers Encyclopedia.

[[Lightning detection]]
CATEGORIES: Meteorological instrumentation and equipment, Avionics, Russian inventions, Lightning

A lightning detector is a device that detects lightning produced by thunderstorms. There are three primary types of detectors: ground-based systems using multiple antennas, mobile systems using a direction and a sense antenna in the same location (often aboard an aircraft), and space-based systems.
The device was invented in 1894 by Alexander Stepanovich Popov. It also was the first radio receiver in the world.
Ground-based and mobile detectors calculate the direction and severity of lightning from the current location using radio direction-finding techniques together with an analysis of the characteristic frequencies emitted by lightning. Ground-based systems use triangulation from multiple locations to determine distance, while mobile systems estimate distance using signal frequency and attenuation. Space-based lightning detectors, on artificial satellites, can locate range, bearing and intensities by direct observation.
Ground-based lightning detector networks are used by meteorological services like the National Weather Service in the United States, the Meteorological Service of Canada, the European Cooperation for Lightning Detection, and by other organizations like electrical utilities and forest fire prevention services.

[[William Abbotts]]
CATEGORIES: 1736 births, 1805 deaths, People from Royal Leamington Spa

William Abbotts (1736 – 1 March 1805Reports of Abbotts death in The Northampton Mercury) was one of the founding fathers of Leamington Spa in Warwickshire, UK. 
Although already an important landowner in the then village it was on 14 January 1784 that Abbotts made the discovery that he would be remembered for. Up until that date there was only one known spring in Leamington and that was on land belonging to the 4th Earl of Aylesford who refused to sell the water (which was used for bathing and medicinal purposes), instead allowing people to have it for free. That year however Abbotts and his friend Benjamin Satchwell found a second spring on Abbotts' land. In the manner of the time its supposed medicinal qualities were used to make money from the leisured classes. Abbotts' "Original" Baths, the first commercial baths in the town, were opened in 1786.
After Satchwell and Abbotts' spring was found several wells were bored and draw water. Leamington quickly grew into on the most fashionable spa resorts of the 19th century, a process which turned it from a sleepy village to a thriving town. Abbotts and his wife ran at least two pubs in the town The Black Dog and The New Inn (the latter being built in 1790 to cope with the already growing tourist trade in Leamington which filled The Black Dog and other guest houses). 
Abbotts had at least one daughter who was born in 1765 or 1766.The obituary of Abbotts daughter in a Gentleman's magazine After his death in 1805 he buried in the Leamington parish church, All Saints, and four years later Satchwell was buried close by. Abbotts Street in the town is, unsurprisingly, named after him and is located close to the site of the original Leamington spring.

CATEGORIES: 2006 Canadian television series debuts, 2006 Canadian television series endings, 2000s Canadian television series, Canadian drama television series, CBC network shows, Canadian television soap operas, Television series set in Vancouver, Television series produced in Vancouver

49th & Main is a CBC Television soap opera. It premiered on July 18, 2006 at 2:30 P.M. (3:00 P.M. in Newfoundland), and ran for 6 episodes on a Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday scheduling setup, with the final episode having aired on July 27.
The series is set in the Punjabi Market district of Vancouver, British Columbia. Much like ITV's Coronation Street, 49th & Main focuses on the interactions of the businesspeople, merchants and residents of the multicultural area. In particular, the series revolves around Dr. Cedric Ferreira, a Kenyan-born Indian with an English upbringing, who decides to bring his young son to Canada and start a medical practice.
The cast of 49th & Main includes Cedric de Souza (in the role of Dr. Ferreira), as well as Rekha Sharma, Agam Darshi, Brandon Jay McLaren, and William B. Davis. Davis is also the co-writer of the first six episodes and directed three of them, with the other three directed by Tom Braidwood. The six episodes were taped in Vancouver in March and April 2006, and an initial pilot was shot in early 2005. Executive Producers of the series are William Wallace Gray and William B. Davis. Creators are Barbara Ellison & William B. Davis.
49th & Main is one of two CBC daytime dramas scheduled for 6-episode runs in July with the potential of a future order from the CBC for a full-scale on-going series. The other one was North/South, which premiered on July 4 in the 2:30 P.M. timeslot.

Simplicius Simplicissimus ([tpl]lang-de|link=no|Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus Teutsch[/tpl]) is a picaresque novel of the lower Baroque style, written in 1668 by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen and probably published the same year (although bearing the date 1669).VD 17, citing Gerhard Dünnhaupt, ed. (1980), Bibliographisches Handbuch der Barockliteratur: Hundert Personalbibliographien deutscher Autoren des siebzehnten Jahrhunderts, 3 vols., Hiersemanns bibliographische Handbücher, no. 2 (Stuttgart: Anton Hiersemann). Inspired by the events and horrors of the Thirty Years' War which had devastated Germany from 1618 to 1648, it is regarded as the first adventure novel in the German language and the first German novel masterpiece.
The full subtitle is "The life of an odd vagrant named Melchior Sternfels von Fuchshaim: namely where and in what manner he came into this world, what he saw, learned, experienced, and endured therein; also why he again left it of his own free will."

[[The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg]]
CATEGORIES: Iron Maiden songs, 2006 singles, Number-one singles in Sweden, Songs written by Steve Harris (musician)

"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg" is a song by Iron Maiden from their 14th studio album, A Matter of Life and Death. The song is the leading single from the album, released on 14 August 2006. 
The CD single comes with a B-side of "Hallowed Be Thy Name" from the BBC Radio 1 Legends Session. Due to the overall length of the two songs, the single was not eligible for chart inclusion in the UK. The single was also released on 10" clear vinyl single, which includes BBC Sessions versions of "The Trooper" and "Run to the Hills" on the B-side.http://www.ironmaiden.com/article.php?section=1&subsection=1&article_type=&article_id=1339
For the EU pressing of the 10" vinyl the sleeve and labels state that it should be played at 33.3 RPM. This is actually incorrect and the correct playing speed is 45 RPM. The USA issue plays correctly at 33.3 RPM.
A promotional version of the single was released on 14 August 2006, featuring the full version and a shorter version called "edited version" in the US promo CD and "rock club mix" in the UK promo CD (both versions are identical). The single was not allowed to have a place in the UK charts because the overall music time on the CD exceeded the time limit for it to be classed as a single.http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews/single_reviews0806.htm
On 17 July 2006, a music video for the song was uploaded on the band's official website. It had initially been released only for paying fan club members, but it was leaked within minutes and viewed by many fans who posted the link on various Iron Maiden discussion forums. The video displays them performing in the studio along with classic photos and clips of the band over their lengthy career.
The guitar solo in "The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg" is played by Dave Murray.

It also flows for a very short distance through Northumberland before joining the River Tweed. In common with the adwaters of the Biel Water it rises on the low hillside of Clints Dod ([tpl]convert|122|m|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]) in the Lammermuir Hills, just ESE of Whitecastle Hillfort and [tpl]convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south-east of the village of Garvald.
The stream wends its way south east for approximately [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] where it joins with the Faseny Water to form the Whiteadder Reservoir formed in 1968, which supplies most of the towns of East Lothian (including Cockenzie power station) and Berwickshire, with water.
From there, crossing into Berwickshire it runs alongside the B6355 road to Ellemford where it joins the Dye Water and further on at Abbey St. Bathans, the Monynut Water.
By this point having become a much larger body of flow, the Whiteadder meanders across Eastern parts of the Merse passing the communities of Preston, Chirnside, Allanton. Here at Allanton the Whiteadder joins with its antonymic counterpart the Blackadder Water. The river proceeds by Foulden, Edrington, and Paxton, it crosses into England, before joining the River Tweed, just north of East Ord, a suburb of Berwick-upon-Tweed.
The lowermost section of the Whiteadder is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by virtue of its Water Crowfoot, Salmon, Lamprey and moulting Mute Swan.

[[National Wildfire Coordinating Group]]
CATEGORIES: Wildland fire suppression, United States Forest Service, United States Department of the Interior, Firefighting in the United States

The National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) was formed in the United States as a result of the aftermath of a major wildfire season in 1970.
The 1970 fire season underscored the need for a national set of training and equipment standards which would be standardized across the different agencies.  NWCG included representatives from the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Association of State Foresters.
After a series of meetings in the early 1970s, the NWCG was officially chartered by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture in 1976.
Among the notable results of the NWCG has been the adoption of the Interagency Fire Qualifications Rating system, more commonly known among firefighters as the "red card" qualification system; the establishment of the series of training classes associated with the red card system (such as the basic wildland fire course, S-130/S-190); the establishment of an interagency fire training center at Marana, Arizona; the publication of training manuals such as the Fireline Handbook; and the Resource Ordering Status System.
NWCG was formed independently of two other programs which also formed in the 1970s out of the need for greater interagency coordination: the Boise Interagency Fire Center (now the National Interagency Fire Center), and the FIRESCOPE program in southern California.

[[Edward John Eliot]]

CATEGORIES: 1782 births, 1863 deaths, Wiltshire Regiment officers, British Militia officers, British Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars, Burials at Nunhead Cemetery, Eliot family of St Germans, People from Shenstone, Staffordshire

Captain Edward John Eliot (20 September 1782 Shenstone, Staffordshire – 6 November 1863 Peckham, Surrey  GRO Register of Deaths: DEC 1863 1d 369 CAMBERWELL - 4 Elm Grove, Camberwell, Surrey) was an English soldier.
Eliot was the son of Francis Perceval Eliot and his wife Anne née Breynton (daughter of Dr John Breynton). He was born into a military family - the son of a Colonel, the grandson and great grandson of Generals, but he himself never rose above the rank of Captain. His letters and papers form an important record of military life for this period.
He enrolled at the age of 15 into his father's Staffordshire Militia as an Ensign (1797), and a Lieutenant (1799). In 1799, he transferred as Ensign of the 62nd (Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot. His unit sailed from Ireland in May 1800 to the Île-d'Houat, in Quiberon Bay, where 40 years earlier the Battle of Quiberon Bay had been fought. However, bad weather prevented a landing and he went on to Minorca where stayed until at least October 1801. By October 1802, he was commissioned as a Lieutenant and posted to Athenry in Ireland. He saw several excursions to the Mediterranean and was promoted to Captain, 4th Garrison Battalion.
During 1807, the Peninsula War was beginning and Edward was among the first of the British troops to fight in the Iberian peninsula, alongside his older brother William Granville Eliot, who was in another regiment. Edward now saw major military action over the next 5 years, including the Battle of Vimiero (following which he was promoted to Captain, 27th Inniskillen Regiment of Foot), the Battle of Talavera, Battle of Bussaco, Defence of the Lines of Torres Vedras, Battle of Badajoz. During this period, he fought in the elite Lord Hill's Flying Brigade.
Having fought in many of the major battles of the campaign, he returned home in 1812. Although he tried to rejoin his regiment, he was clearly unwell and in 1814 retired from the Army altogether aged just 32.
On 22 November 1826, he married Margaret James and had 6 children. The couple settled firstly in Greenwich, then Finsbury and eventually Peckham, Surrey,1841 English census: 1841/06/06 ? Officer, aged 55 (57?), of 17 Coles Terrace, Barnaby Road, Finsbury, Middlesex - HO107/665 Bk.7 f.11 p.171851 English census: 1851/03/30 Landing Waiter in HM Customs, aged 67, of 4 Elm Grove, Peckham, Camberwell, Surrey - HO107/1581 f.614 p.351861 English census: 1861/04/07 Captain Army, Retired, aged 77 of 4 Elm Grove, Camberwell, Surrey - RG9/382 f.34 p.27 where he joined HM Customs as a landing waiter - a secure job for an ex-army officer.
The army had initially refused him the usual Peninsula campaign medals. However, following a protracted communication, these were finally awarded in the 1840s, 25 years after his return. Together with letters from the Peninsula War, this communication forms a substantial record of his military career.
He retired in the 1850s, died at Peckham in 1863 and is buried in Nunhead Cemetery.

[[Raising (metalworking)]]
CATEGORIES: Metal forming

Raising is a metalworking technique whereby sheet metal is formed over a stake or other solid object by repeated 'courses' of hammering and annealing. The sheet metal, held at an angle to the stake, is formed using mechanical advantage by hammering just in front of the contact point. When executed correctly raising allows the smith to efficiently shape the metal without thinning thus avoiding the risk of cracking, a common occurrence with parallel forming processes such as sinking or stretching.  In raising the metal at the edge of the sheet is compressed and thickened as the form is necked in. This technique is an essential part of silversmithing and is used to create seamless vessels such as vases, cups, bowls, carafes, pitchers, euers, etc.   
In traditional raising, sometimes referred to as Synclastic raising, the dominant curves of the object being forged are at right angles and move in the same direction; as in a bowl. This results in a surface possessing elliptic geometry.
Anticlastic raising, on the other hand, refers to shaping an object where the dominant axes move in opposite directions; a familiar example of this is a potato chip. This results in a surface possessing hyperbolic geometry.

[[Nikolausberg]]
CATEGORIES: Towns in Lower Saxony, Göttingen

Nikolausberg is a northeastern borough of the university town of Göttingen, Germany. Its name derives from a legend according to which three pilgrims came to the church in 999 AD, of whom one left relics of Nicholas of Myra following his death there. However, the name Nikolausberg has apparently been used only from the 17th century. The village was originally known as Ulrideshusen, with other variants recorded as Adelratheshusen, Ulradeshusen, Olerdeshausen, and Olrikshusen.
The founding of the church and village are not documented. However, the church incorporates remains of an Augustinian nunnery, which was first mentioned in a document of Pope Alexander III in which he confirmed the independence of the nunnery. Among others, this document verifies the possession of sufficient land in the neighboring village of Roringen to support four families. The nunnery was already moved to the lower-lying village of Weende around 1180 AD, due to the lack of close-by wells. Street names still recall the former nunnery, such as Am Kreuze, Nonnenstieg and Augustinerstraße. Thanks to the relics which remained with the church after 1180,the church remained a pilgrimage destination until the reformation.
Among the known pilgrims to the church were Duchess Margarete of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1397) and Landgrave Ludwig of Hesse (1430).
Visits to the church are documented all the way into the 17th century based on signatures left on the inside of the church's walls.
The original church was conceived as a romanesque basilica, of which the lion portal and the arches surrounding it still survive. The church was rebuilt into a gothic hall church as of the 14th century, and was completed as such following 1500 AD. The church was plundered in 1447, when soldiers of Duke Wilhem III of Saxony came through the area as part of the Saxon Brothers' War.
The stone altar that originally held the relics of St. Nicholaus is now empty.

In wildland fire suppression in the United States, S-130/S-190 refers to the basic wildland fire training course required of all firefighters before they can work on the firelines. 
Wildland fire training in the U.S. has been standardized by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group since the 1970s.  The same basic courses are given across all agencies involved in wildland firefighting and controlled burning, including:
A recent trend in some states is to hold an annual statewide wildfire academy in which students from different agencies, from federal agencies to local volunteer fire departments, can take these courses.  This is now done, for example, in Virginia, Utah, Arizona, and Nebraska among other states. Colorado Firecamp is the only wildfire academy to teach the S-130/S-190 course year round.
S-130 and S-190 are actually two different courses.  But since they are usually taken together the basic wildland fire training is called "S-130/S-190" or "S-130/190" for short.  Basic wildland fire training also includes some other courses.  The full list of courses usually included in "S-130/S-190" is:
Training manuals for these courses are published by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group.  There are also more advanced and specialized courses not covered in the basic wildland fire training.
The work capacity test ("pack test") is also usually given during the course.  Passing S-130/190 and the pack test are both required to fight wildfires.  After successful completion of both, you are able to receive a qualification card known as a "red card". Holding a current "red card" indicates that you are qualified to work on the firelines, as well as other disasters, as determined by the Federal Government. This "Red Card" is not included, and if you are a member of a VFD, must be obtained separately.
S-130/190 is also increasingly being offered at a handful of colleges as part of their fire science or forestry degree programs.  At a few 4-year colleges those in the class will actually be part of a working hand crew chartered by the college for the rest of the semester or quarter, after completing the basic course and the pack test.  At most (2-year community colleges) it is just a short, 1 credit hour course.

CATEGORIES: National Wildlife Refuges in Oregon, Protected areas of Polk County, Oregon, Wetlands of Oregon, 1965 establishments in Oregon

Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge is located in northwestern Oregon, 10 miles (16 km) west of Salem in Polk County. Situated in open farmland near the eastern foothills of the Oregon Coast Range with the broad Willamette Valley and the Cascade Range to the east, elevations range from 185 to 414 feet (56 to 126 m) MSL. The Willamette Valley, with its mild, rainy winter climate, is an ideal environment for wintering waterfowl. The valley was once a rich mix of wildlife habitats with extensive wetlands,  meandering stream channels and vast seasonal marshes. Today, the valley is a mix of farmland and growing cities, with few areas remaining for wildlife. The Refuge consists of 1,173 acres (4.75 km²) of cropland, which provide forage for wintering geese, 300 acres (1.2 km²) of forests, 550 acres (2.2 km²) of grasslands, and 500 acres (2.0 km²) of shallow water seasonal wetlands and 35 acres (0.14 km²) of permanent open water. In 1965, Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge was created to help ensure some of the original habitat remained for species preservation. The refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior.

[[Tommy Woodcock]]
CATEGORIES: 1905 births, 1985 deaths, Australian horse trainers

Aaron Treve "Tommy" Woodcock (8 October 1905[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]27 April 1985) was the Australian handler of the racehorse Phar Lap.
He was born at Uralgurra, near Kempsey, New South Wales, in 1905. Woodcock served an apprenticeship as a jockey under Barney Quinn, who was based at Randwick, in Sydney. He won several starts, and worked as a jockey until 1927, when he was 22 years old. However as his size and weight increased he gave up jockeying in favour of riding work and strapping for trainers.
It was in this way that he met Harry Telford and Phar Lap. In 1929, Telford employed Woodcock full-time as Phar Lap's strapper. From then on, Tommy and Phar Lap were virtually inseparable. Before big races, Woodcock would sleep outside Phar Lap's stable, and it was said that Phar Lap refused food from anyone but Tommy.
Following on from Phar Lap's defeat in the 1931 Melbourne Cup the horse was shipped to America, where he competed in and won the Agua Caliente Handicap. Shortly afterwards, on 5 April 1932, Phar Lap died suddenly. Ever the devoted strapper, Woodcock was with him in his final moments.
Woodcock continued to work with horses until his retirement in 1983. In his later years he achieved fame through training Reckless. In 1977, with Reckless he won the Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane Cups all in the same year and ran second in the  Melbourne Cup.
Tommy Woodcock died at Yarrawonga on 27 April 1985, aged 79, where he was cared for in his last years by his life long friends, the Hinchliffe family. His cremated remains were interred at the Springvale Botanical Cemetery in Melbourne.
In 2012 a Wagga Wagga mother and daughter, Louise Clayton and Tegan Ellis, became aware that the tenure on his ashes and memorial plaque had expired on December 31, 2011. Louise and Tegan, along with Margaret Benson, who wrote Tommy Woodcock: The Story of Australia's Most Remarkable Trainer in 1978, collected $465 to pay for Woodcock's ashes to remain in perpetuity in his original resting place.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/superracing/tommy-woodcock-ashes-saved-at-cemetery/story-fn67siys-1226430361748 |title=Tommy Woodcock ashes saved at cemetery  |author=Brent Zerafa |date=20 July 2012 |work= |publisher=Herald Sun |accessdate=14 August 2012[/tpl]
Mr Cliff Hinchliffe, the sole Executor of Tommy Woodcock's estate, later had this money returned to Louise Clayton and Tegan Ellis, having cleared the misunderstanding with the Springvale Cemetery. 
In 2012 Tommy Woodcock was inducted into the  Australian Racing  Hall of Fame.

The basin was covered with mud and high concentrations of salt and other minerals so that no fish could survive. In 1998, the government of Ardabil started diluting the lake water by linking rivers from the surrounding area. After almost 2 years they also started growing a kind of fish called "ghezel-aala" in the lake which is famous for having pink meat and wonderful taste. In 1999 a floating restaurant was built and placed in the middle of the lake. which was transferred to the government but it was later shifted to the shore as they could not handle the maintenance and other technical difficulties.

The Autonomous Extravehicular Activity Robotic Camera Sprint (AERCam Sprint) is a NASA experiment to demonstrate the use of a prototype free-flying television camera. It was tested on STS-87 and could also be used for remote inspections of the exterior of the International Space Station.
The AERCam Sprint free-flyer is a [tpl]convert|14|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter[/tpl], 35-pound sphere that contains two television cameras, an avionics system and 12 small nitrogen gas-powered thrusters. The sphere, which looks like an oversized soccer ball, was released by Mission Specialist Winston E. Scott during the STS-87 spacewalk and flew freely in the forward cargo bay for about 30 minutes. The free-flyer was remotely controlled by Pilot Steven W. Lindsey from the Shuttle's aft flight deck using a hand controller, two laptop computers and a window-mounted antenna. The AERCam is designed to fly very slowly at a rate of less than one-quarter of a foot per second. Remote control of the AERCam is performed through two-way UHF radio communications, with data regarding the status of the free-flyer's systems transmitted back to the operator. Television images are transmitted back to the operator via a one-way S-band communications link. During the experiment operations, live television images were also relayed via Columbia to Mission Control. Two miniature color television cameras are mounted on the free-flyer, one with a 6 millimeter lens and another with a 12 millimeter lens. The exterior of the free-flyer sphere is covered with a [tpl]convert|6/10|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick[/tpl] layer of Nomex felt to cushion any inadvertent contact with a spacecraft surface and prevent damage.

The Hunting Party ([tpl]lang-fr|Partie de chasse[/tpl]) is a political thriller graphic novel from 1983 written by Pierre Christin and illustrated by Enki Bilal. It is centered around a group of old, mostly retired or disgraced Communist bloc political leaders who meet in Poland for a bear-hunting party under the guide of Soviet Presidium leader Vasili Aleksandrovič Čevčenko, an aging revolutionary leader who, while retired from official duties, still retains much of his power and political influence. The year in which the story takes place is not specified, but it appears to be set in 1983, per Sergej Šavanidze's fictional biography on page 1, which states that "... at 44 (Šavanidze was born in 1939), he is the youngest member of the Politburo".
The characters, while reminiscing about their individual role in the gradual building of the Communist empire from the Revolution onwards, and the tragedies they had to endure along with growing disillusionment with the Socialist dream, plot to kill the new up-and-coming personality in the Politburo and thus stop his Stalinist political vision meant to ensure social immobilism for all the Eastern bloc.

[[Sirente crater]]
CATEGORIES: Geology theories, Geography of Abruzzo

The Sirente crater ([tpl]lang-it|Cratere del Sirente[/tpl]) is a small shallow seasonal lake in Abruzzo, central Italy. The depression, which is located at the center of the Prati del Sirente, a mountainous highland north of the Sirente massif in the Apennines, is [tpl]convert|13|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from the village of Secinaro. Its formation has prompted a number of theories in recent years.
Interest in the Sirente crater began in the late 1990s after Swedish geologist Jens Ormö, an impact crater specialist, noticed ridges near the site that indicated a bolide collision. A research team named "The Sirente Crater Group" along with two scientists from the International Research School of Planetary Science of Pescara (IRSPS) began a detailed examination of the area. The team concluded the meteorite struck the Earth with the force of a small nuclear bomb; approximately one kiloton in yield. The blast would have created a mushroom cloud and shockwaves similar to a nuclear explosion.

"Homo Sol" is a science fiction short story by Isaac Asimov that was first published in the September 1940 issue of Astounding Science Fiction and reprinted in the 1972 collection The Early Asimov. It deals with the proposed acceptance into a galactic federation of hominid civilizations of the hominids of newly discovered Earth. (Each member civilization is referred to by a prefix denoting its shared "hominidity", followed by the name of its star — hence the title, Homo Sol.)
Together with its two sequels (The Imaginary and The Hazing) which form a 'Homo Sol Trilogy', the story is primarily set in a university environment.  Homo Sol was the nineteenth story written by Asimov, the eighth to be published, and the second to appear in Astounding, which was then the world's leading science fiction magazine.

Thailand's Royal Barge Procession ([tpl]lang-th|กระบวนพยุหยาตราชลมารค[/tpl]; RTGS: Krabuan Phayuhayattra Chonlamak) is a ceremony of both religious and royal significance which has been taking place for nearly 700 years.  The exquisitely crafted Royal Barges are a blend of craftsmanship and traditional Thai art.  The Royal Barge Procession takes place rarely, typically coinciding with only the most significant cultural and religious events.  During the reign of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, spanning over 60 years, the Procession has only occurred 16 times.
The Royal Barge Procession, in the present, consists of 52 barges: 51 historical Barges, and the Royal Barge, the Narai Song Suban, which King Rama IX built in 1994. It is the only Barge built during King Bhumibol's reign. These barges are manned by 2,082 oarsmen.  The Procession proceeds down the Chao Phraya River, from the Wasukri Royal Landing Place in Khet Dusit, Bangkok, passes the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the Grand Palace, Wat Po ([tpl]lang-th|วัดโพธิ์[/tpl]), and finally arrives at Wat Arun ([tpl]lang-th|วัดอรุณ[/tpl], Temple of the Dawn).

James Bane (or Ben) (died 1332) was Bishop of St. Andrews for a brief period in the early 14th century. In his earlier career, James had been a canon of Aberdeen and prebendary of Cruden. 
James rose to the position of Archdeacon of St. Andrews, one of the most senior positions within the diocese. He was appointed one of the ambassadors to France along with Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, Robert Keith the Marischal of Scotland, Adam de Moravia and Walter de Twynham in 1326 to renew the Auld Alliance with the signing of the Treaty of Corbeil (1326).Michel,vol I, p 55  Ten days after the death of Bishop William de Lamberton in 1328, the chapter held an election to fill the vacancy. James, although fortunately absent at the court of Pope John XXII at Rome, stood against Alexander de Kyninmonth, Archdeacon of Lothian, and won. However, before news of his victory reached Rome, Pope John, who had previously reserved his right to do so, had already provided James to the see. James was consecrated, sometime in the same year, by Bertrand de Turre, Bishop of Frascati. 
In the aftermath of the Battle of Dupplin Moor on 12 August 1332, after roughly two years back in Scotland as chief-bishop of the kingdom, James fled to Flanders. He met his death at Bruges in the same year. He was succeeded to the bishopric by William Bell.

[[Hyunmoo]]

CATEGORIES: Ballistic missiles of South Korea, Tactical ballistic missiles, Post–Cold War weapons of South Korea, Short-range ballistic missiles

Hyunmoo (Hangul: 현무, literally means "Guardian of the Northern Sky") was a series of missiles developed by South Korea.
The Hyunmoo is the only ballistic missile developed by South Korea that was actually deployed. This missile improved the first stage propelling device that was a problem in the Paekgom. The first test-launch of the Hyunmoo was successful in 1982; following domestic twists and turns due to internal political situation of South Korea until the second test-launch in September 1985 flight test by the Defense Systems Test Center (DSTC).
In 1986, South Korea succeeded in a test-launch in the current capacity with a payload of 480 kg and a range of 180 km. The US, however, withheld the export approval of Hyunmoo in 1990, and requested South Korea to provide technical information on the Hyunmoo. It also requested a note by South Korea promising not to develop missiles with a range over 180 km. After providing the US with the guarantee correspondence, South Korea started to produce a limited number of Hyunmoo missiles and was under the inspection of the United States until the production ended.
The Hyunmoo system name roughly translates as "guardian angel of the northern skies", has been indigenously developed in the Agency for Defense Development and now it is in service by ROK Army
The missile is launched from the mobile launcher and fire-controlled by the battery control van. The Hyunmoo missile, which is propelled by two-stage solid rocket motor and features inertial guidance and control system, can reach the heart of its intended targets under any weather conditions without any commands from the ground after fire. The missile is approximately 12m long, weighting 5 tons. 
A new cruise missile was recently unveiled, named Hyunmoo-3, which is very similar to the American Tomahawk. The Hyunmoo-3C has an increased range of 1,500 km.
The upgraded version of Hyunmoo-2A, named Hyunmoo-2B, was put into service since late 2009. The ballistic missile has in increased range of 500 km.[tpl]cite news| title="사거리 500km 국산 탄도미사일 '현무-2B' 실전배치했다"| url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/02/18/2011021801716.html[/tpl]

Missile Range Instrumentation Ships, Range Ships, or Tracking Ships, are ships equipped with antennas and electronics to support the launching and tracking of missiles and rockets.  Since many missile ranges launch over ocean areas for safety reasons, the Range Ships extend the range of shore based tracking facilities.
In the United States the initial Tracking Ships were constructed by the US Army and then US Air Force to support their Missile Programs.  They were generally built on a surplus Liberty ship or Victory ship hull.  By 1964 the US Navy took over all the Range Ships and introduced more.

[[Muhammad in Mecca]]
CATEGORIES: Life of Muhammad, History of Mecca

The Islamic prophet Muhammad was born and lived in Mecca for the first 52 years of his life (570–622). Orphaned early in life, he became known as a prominent merchant, and as an impartial and trustworthy arbiter of disputes. He married his first wife, the 40-year-old widow Khadijah bint Khuwaylid at age 25. He would not take other wives during her lifetime.
According to the Muslim tradition, Muhammad began receiving revelations at the age of 40. The key themes of his messages in Mecca were the oneness of God and the rejection of polytheism, generosity towards the poor and the needy, kind treatment and emancipation of slaves, and the equality between men and women before God. Some of his peers respected his words and became his followers. Many others, including tribal leaders, opposed, ridiculed and eventually boycotted his clan, and Muhammad and his followers were harassed, assaulted, tortured and forced into exile. Several attempts were made on his life.Sirat Ibn Hisham, vol. 1, p. 298Sahih Bukhari: Volume 6, Book 60, Number 339 When his uncle and chief protector, Abu Talib, who was the head of the clan of Banu Hashim died, Muhammad migrated to Medina in 622, where he had many followers who agreed to help and assist him.
 Islamic tradition relates many events during this period that foreshadow his prophethood. 
 He also made the [[Isra and Mi'raj|night journey]] to [[Jerusalem]] and the heavens in one night.

Born in Mexico City, the son of journalist José Luis Sainz, Gustavo Sainz learned how to read at the age of three from his paternal grandmother, and started publishing his work in the city newspapers at the age of ten. When he was in primary school, Sainz founded several school magazines, which he continued to do until college. At the age of eighteen, Sainz left home to work as a journalist in the magazine Visión. In 1960, he entered the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, where he began studying law, but ultimately changed to study literature.

The Buddha in Hinduism is viewed as an avatar of the god Vishnu. Buddha's teachings deny the authority of the Vedas and consequently Buddhism is generally viewed as a nāstika school (heterodox, literally "It is not so")"In Sanskrit philosophical literature, 'āstika' means 'one who believes in the authority of the Vedas' or 'one who believes in life after death'.

The Juno Awards of 1995, representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 26 March 1995 in Hamilton, Ontario at a ceremony in the Copps Coliseum. Mary Walsh, Rick Mercer and other regulars of the television series This Hour Has 22 Minutes were the hosts for the ceremonies, which were broadcast on CBC Television. Almost 10,000 people were in attendance, and over 6,500 public tickets were sold.
Nominees were announced on 1 February 1995. Susan Aglukark and Jann Arden were among the prominent nominees this year. Vancouver rock band 54-40's album Smilin' Buddha Cabaret was accidentally left off the nomination list for Best Alternative Album; after realizing the error, the Academy decided to add them to the category, and rather than remove another band's album simply widened the category to six nominees.[tpl]cite news |title=Juno admits to goof, adds B.C. band to list |newspaper=The Toronto Star |date=24 February 1995 |page=C10 [/tpl]

Herald House or Herald Publishing House is the publishing division of the Community of Christ in Independence, Missouri. It publishes books, periodicals and other materials at the direction of the First Presidency. Its history dates back to the publication of a church periodical called the True Latter Day Saints' Herald in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1860. The first church-owned press was located in Plano, Illinois and a much larger facility was opened in Lamoni, Iowa in 1881. The publishing plant in Lamoni was destroyed by fire in 1907. A replacement facility was built shortly thereafter. When the church headquarters moved to Independence, Missouri in 1921, the Herald House was relocated to a facility that had previously been used by an artillery battalion of the Missouri National Guard. In 1965, a modern publishing facility was built for Herald House on Noland Road in Independence. That facility was closed in 1999 and printing has been outsourced since that date. The publishing offices were moved to The Temple and The Auditorium in Independence, Missouri.
Today, Herald House publishes the Herald, the monthly denominational magazine of the Community of Christ. The Herald is a member of the Associated Church Press from whom it has received awards and other recognition in recent years. Herald Publishing House is a non-profit 501(c)(3) and a public charity 509(a)(3). The editor is Richard A. Brown. Books published by Herald House include scriptures, scripture studies, Christian education materials, worship resources, inspirational books, priesthood and leadership manuals, hymnals (including the official denominational hymnal, Hymns of the Saints), missionary materials, stewardship materials and theological studies.  
Herald House also does business under the Independence Press publishing imprint.[tpl]cite web | title=Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=Herald House | url=http://www.heraldhouse.org/frequently-asked-questions.htm | accessdate=2010-04-07[/tpl]

Its exact location is unknown but it is now generally located in the southern suburbs of Athens. The Stones of Athens, Wycherley, R.E., Princeton 1978.Pg 229
Its name was a mystery to the ancients that was explained by a story about a white  or swift dog,  etymologising the name as Kynos argos, from genitive of kyon (dog) and argos (white, shining or swift). The legend goes that on one occasion when Didymos, an Athenian, was performing a lavish sacrifice, a white (or swift) dog appeared and snatched the offering; Didymos was alarmed, but received an oracular message saying that he should establish a temple to Heracles in the place where the dog dropped the offering.Suda, κ2721, ε3160. In another account, (Suda, ει290) a white dog was being sacrificed, and an eagle stole and dropped the offering.
Herodotus mentions a shrine there in 490/89 BC,Herodotus, Historiae 6.116 and it became a famous sanctuary of Heracles which was also associated with his mother Alcmena, his wife Hebe and his helper Iolaus.Pausanias, Description of Greece 1.19.3.

The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force is a federal drug enforcement program in the United States, overseen by the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.  It primarily concerns itself with the disruption of major drug trafficking operations and related crimes, such as money laundering, tax and weapon violations, and violent crime. The task force was created in 1982, and employs approximately 2500 agents.
Together with state and local law enforcement, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task force utilizes the resources of eleven U.S. federal agencies to accomplish its objectives. This includes the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard – in cooperation with the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Tax Division, and the 93 U.S. Attorney's Offices, as well as with state and local law enforcement.
Since the formation of the organization, its operations have led to more than 44,000 drug-related convictions and the seizure of over $3.0 billion in cash and property assets.[tpl]cite web| title =Executive Office for the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force | publisher =U.S. Department of Justice | url =http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/ocdetf.html | accessdate =2006-10-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061001163729/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/ocdetf.html  |archivedate = 2006-10-01[/tpl]
Each of the ninety-three federal judicial districts is placed into one of nine OCDETF regions based on geographic proximity.  Within each region, a "core city" was designated.
The principal mission of the OCDETF program is to identify, disrupt, and dismantle the most serious drug trafficking and money laundering organizations and those primarily responsible for the nation's drug supply. 
OCDETF is the centerpiece of the Attorney General's drug supply reduction strategy.  In order to enhance the OCDETF Program's ability to contribute to the President's mandate to reduce the drug supply, the Program focuses its resources on coordinated, nationwide investigations, targeting the entire infrastructure of major drug trafficking.  It also assisted in the development of the Attorney General's Consolidated Priority Organization Target (CPOT) List, a unified agency target list of international "command and control" drug traffickers and money launderers. OCDETF's attack on the related components of these major trafficking organizations will not only disrupt the drug market, resulting in a reduction in the drug supply, but will also bolster law enforcement efforts in the fight against those terrorist groups supported by the drug trade.[tpl]cite web| title =Executive Office for the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force | publisher =U.S. Department of Jusice | url =http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/ocdetf.htm | accessdate =2007-03-08[/tpl]

[[Agathosma crenulata]]

CATEGORIES: Rutaceae

Agathosma crenulata (previously Barosma crenulata) is a flowering plant in the family Rutaceae, native to the lower elevation mountains of southwestern South Africa, where it occurs near streams in fynbos habitats. It is an evergreen shrub growing to 1.5-2.5 m tall. The leaves are opposite, oval, 15-35 mm long and 7-18 mm broad. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals; the fruit is a five-parted capsule which splits open to release the seeds.
It is known by the common name oval leaf buchu and has historically been used as a flavoring agent and an herbal remedy. The very similar plant Agathosma betulina (previously Barosma betulina) is known as the round leaf buchu, and has been used for the same purposes.
The plant produces many sweet-smelling white flowers, which attract nectar-drinking insects. It then produces small green fruits. The leaves have traditionally been steeped in brandy, vinegar, and tea water, and are said to relieve gastrointestinal and urinary tract ailments.

Frederick James (Mickey) Ion (February 25, 1886 in Paris, Ontario – October 26, 1964) was a Canadian professional lacrosse player and  ice hockey referee. He was referee-in-chief of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) and later the referee-in-chief of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
A professional lacrosse player with the Toronto Tecumsehs in 1909, Ion signed with the Vancouver Lacrosse Club team in 1911.  The team was run by hockey entrepreneurs Lester Patrick and Frank Patrick, and when they started the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in 1911, they hired several of their lacrosse players—Ion among them—to referee the league's games.
Ion quickly became the league's chief referee. Among his innovations was the first known season-ending All-Star team, the naming of which was a regular practice of his from then on and which received much publicity each year.  His first such selection, in the 1913–14 PCHA season, had Hugh Lehman of New Westminster in goal, Ernie Johnson of New Westminster and Frank Patrick of Vancouver on defence, Cyclone Taylor of Vancouver as the rover, and Tom Dunderdale of Victoria, Eddie Oatman of New Westminster and Dubbie Kerr of Victoria at forward.  He was well known as being an iron man, officiating as many as four or five games in a week throughout western Canada.
Ion joined the Western Canada Hockey League as senior official when the PCHA folded in 1924, and the National Hockey League in 1926 when the western loop folded as well.  He was later named referee-in-chief of the NHL, a position he held until 1942.
He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame - one of the first three referees to be so honoured - in 1961.

[[Wall unit]]
CATEGORIES: Furniture, Interior design

A wall unit is a premanufactured furnishing that has become very popular the past 25 years. It is an assembly of several discrete components that are usually fixed to an internal wall of a room. Wall unit fixtures are usually customised per installation and range in style from contemporary to traditional in order to match the decore of the home or business establishment in which they are installed.
Wall units are often made from oak, maple, yellow cedar, paduk wood, American and European beech, purple heart wood, alder and cherry. Some companies combine solid and wood veneers or use MDF or particle board to create wall units that normally have amendable shelves. But aside from using wood, metal and glass can also be employed in their manufacture. Wall units are convenient for builders in that they can be easily installed. This kind of furniture can be utilised as storage, provide a surface for food preparation or to house whitegoods in kitchens, as entertainment centres for television or audio equipment or have many other household or office uses.

The first volume lists the detailed symptoms caused by 27 different drugs.Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, Review of Fragmenta de viribus of Hahnemann, Vol. 5, July 1809, pp.374-379The Medical Quarterly Review, Review of the Fragmenta de viribus of Hahnemann, (English translation by Dr FHH Quin, 1834, London), Vol. III, October 1835, pp.149-151"The frequently appearing symptoms were stressed by italics....the second volume contains the totality of the symptoms in alphabetical order."Rudolf Tischner, History of Homeopathy (trans. L J Boyd), New York: AIH, 1933, p.269
The book lists the health effects of 27 drugs in common use as recorded in the medical literature along with Hahnemann's own observations from taking the drugs himself: "The first collection of the effects of medicines...according to his own observations and those of others was, as is well known, published in the work, Fragmenta de viribus medicamentorum, 1805."Wilhelm Ameke, History of Homœopathy, with an appendix on the present state of University medicine, translated by A. E. Drysdale, edited by R. E. Dudgeon, London: E. Gould & Son, 1885, p.177 These were "medicinal substances whose pure pathogenetic action he had ascertained by experiments on himself, his family, and a few friends."Robert E Dudgeon, Lectures on the Theory and Practice of Homeopathy, London & Manchester: Henry Turner & Co, 1853, p.181 The book makes no mention of homeopathy or any theories of cure and makes no claims about their uses. However, it is widely regarded as the forerunner of his Materia Medica Pura, part one of which was published in 1811: "the Materia Medica Pura had had its precursor in the Fragmenta." Linn J Boyd, A Study of the Simile in Medicine, Philadelphia: Boericke & Tafel, 1936, p.149 "The work, begun in the "Fragmenta," was continued in the "Materia Medica Pura," the first volume of which appeared in 1811 followed by five more volumes up to 1821."

[[Mary Hardy (comedian)]]
CATEGORIES: Australian television actresses, Australian women comedians, 1931 births, 1985 deaths, People from Bacchus Marsh, Suicides in Victoria (Australia)

Mary Hardy (14 October 1931 – 7 January 1985) was an Australian television and radio presenter, actor and comedian. She was best known for her caustic wit, indifference to authority and tireless ability to ad lib.
Mary Veronica Hardy was born in Warrnambool and brought up in Bacchus Marsh.
She was the youngest of eight children; her parents were Winifred Mary (née Bourke) and Thomas John Hardy; the author Frank Hardy was her brother. Her professional acting career began in 1950, when she was noticed by J. C. Williamson, where she worked for several years in various productions. In 1957, as Peter in the J. C. Williamson production of Peter Pan, Mary first became known as a star, proving to be a huge success.
The following year, after her nomination for Actress of the Year for her role as Frankie in A Member of the Wedding, the recently formed Union Theatre Company offered Mary a permanent position joining actors such as Noel Ferrier, Frank Thring, Toni Lamond and Fred Parslow. She first appeared with UTC as the cabin boy Pip in Moby Dick—Rehearsed.
The move from theatre to television came via the late night satirical revues she helped write. Initially these were at the Arlen Theatre in St. Kilda with, amongst others, Noel Tovey. Later she would perform at the Phillip Theatre in Sydney with Jill Perryman, Gordon Chater and Judi Farr. In 1964 Noel Ferrier asked Mary if she would return to Melbourne to join him on television in In Melbourne Tonight. At the same time she also began co-hosting a morning radio program on 3UZ which was to become the most popular afternoon radio program for five years.
Both these live programs allowed her to ad-lib. She was very successful and won seven Logie awards http://tvweek.ninemsn.com.au/section.aspx?sectionid=1923&sectionname=logies&subsectionid=9698&subsectionname=logieawards TV Week Logie Awards for Best Female Personality. Proving to be too successful, especially at the expense of male comedians, she was sacked from GTV-9. She later said "Before I came on the scene, if you were a woman on television, you were barrel girl, a weather girl or a wheel spinner...".
Mary Hardy returned to the theatre and in 1969 was awarded the Rosa Ribush Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Agnes in Mame.
Later in 1971 she signed up with HSV-7 to once again co-host with Mike Williamson a variety program called The Penthouse Club. This became the most successful variety program on Australian television in the 1970s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] She was famously suspended from the show in late 1974 for swearing, but she was later reinstated. In the 1970s she also worked at radio station 3AW.
The stress of her career in radio and television was considerable and in May 1977, Mary collapsed on set. She was admitted to a private hospital for two weeks, and later gave several interviews about what the studio called a 'virus' which had officially struck her down. But she made no attempt to hide her perilous state saying "You're just hanging by a bit of a string and sometimes they let go of the string and you fall down".
Over the next two years, the 'rests' between shows, the live 'walkouts' on air and brief stays in hospital became more frequent and she left The Penthouse Club in late 1978. After winning her seventh and final Logie, knowing that her long running command over variety television was coming to an end, she said "I really have to thank Graham Kennedy for this. If he hadn't got me the sack all those years ago, I would not have gone to Seven".
Mary committed suicide on 7 January 1985[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/02/mary-hardy-the-tragic-clown.html/comment-page-1|title=Mary Hardy, the tragic clown|last=Knox|first=David|date=6 February 2008|accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl] and was buried in the Cheltenham Memorial Park (Wangara Road).
In 1987 her brother Frank wrote a play Mary Lives!, celebrating her life, which was staged at the Malthouse Theatre.
In February 2008 ABC TV broadcast a 30-minute documentary on Hardy's life entitled IOU: Mary Hardy.
Her grandniece is Australian writer and media personality Marieke Hardy.

[[Place-based education]]
CATEGORIES: Alternative education, Critical pedagogy

Place-based education, sometimes called pedagogy of place, place-based learning, experiential education, community-based education, education for sustainability, environmental education or more rarely, service learning, is an educational philosophy developed initially by The Orion Society, [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/education/item/3539/ |title=The Nature Literacy Series |publisher=Orion Magazine |date= |accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl] a Massachusetts based nonprofit organization, as well as Professor David Sobel, Project Director at Antioch University New England though educators have used its principles for decades. The term was coined in the early 1990s by Laurie Lane-Zucker of The Orion Society and  Dr. John Elder of Middlebury College. Orion's early work in the area of place-based education was funded by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation. 
Place-based education seeks to help communities through employing students and school staff in solving community problems. Place-based education differs from conventional text and classroom-based education in that it understands students' local community as one of the primary resources for learning. Thus, place-based education promotes learning that is rooted in what is local—the unique history, environment, culture, economy, literature, and art of a particular placeRural Education[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl]--that is, in students’ own “place” or immediate schoolyard, neighborhood, town or community. According to this pedagogy, grade school students often lose what place-based educators call their “sense of place” through focusing too quickly or exclusively on national or global issues. This is not to say that international and domestic issues are peripheral to place-based education, but that students should first have a grounding in the history, culture and ecology of their surrounding environment before moving on to broader subjects. 
Place-based education is often hands-on, project-based and always related to something in the real world. Thus students embarking upon a unit about the Vietnam War might interview veterans of that war, collecting their stories for a radio-spot, newspaper article or educational brochure. In this case, the use of local people to support students’ learning would not only lead to greater comprehension of the Vietnam War, but also to understanding more about the history of their community and the people in it.  
Byron Fellowship is a place-based learning experience built around sustainable community development.
Wintergreen Studios is a year-round wilderness education and retreat centre in Southeastern Ontario offering workshops and meeting facilities. Wintergreen's environment and architecture have been designed to enable people to engage in mindful living and return to their homes and workplaces inspired and refreshed.

[[Indo jazz]]

CATEGORIES: Jazz by nationality

Indo jazz is a hybrid musical genre consisting of jazz, classical and Indian influences. The structure and patterns would be based on Indian music with the improvisation typical to jazz overlaid. The term might be comparatively recent, but the concept dates at least to the mid-1950s. Musicians like John Coltrane, Yusef Lateef, and others showed Indian influences. 
The Mahavishnu Orchestra might be an early example of a jazz group with Indian influences as John McLaughlin at that time was a devotee of Sri Chinmoy. Others found the improvisational elements already in some Indian music to fit well with jazz. Although John Mayer and Joe Harriott are perhaps the most important influences in the movement. In addition Alice Coltrane is also known for relational work.Roots World
In the early 1970s, L. Subramaniam pioneered a new movement of Indo-Jazz fusion, which he called "Neo-fusion." It became very popular especially after the release of his albums like Fantasy Without Limits (1979), Blossom (1981), Spanish Wave (1983), Conversations (1984), Indian Express (1985), and Mani and Co. (1986) in which he collaborated with musicians like Stephane Grappelli, George Duke, Stanley Clarke, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Larry Coryell, Emil Richards among others. 
The most popular Indian based Indo-Jazz band would be KARMA with internationally acclaimed tabla maestro Subhen Chatterjee ...Lew Hilt (India's best known bassist) / Amyt Dutta ( one of India's best Jazz guitarists ) & others fronting the band..
Indo jazz is danced all around the world and many studios have opened up in honor of it. An example is Shaimak, very famous for teaching all kinds of Indian dancing, from traditional to modern. They specialize in Indo Jazz.

He is the author of ten books, the most recent being The Day of Islam: The Annihilation of America and the Western World, in which he expands on the American Hiroshima scenario he believes to be imminent, in which simultaneous nuclear attacks on 7 to 10 American cities would create havoc in American society. 
In October, Williams wrote a book Dunces of Doomsday in which he claimed that Adnan Shukrijumah, Amer el-Maati, Jaber A. Elbaneh and Anas al-Liby had all been seen around Hamilton, Ontario the previous year, and that Shukrijumah had been seen at McMaster University where he "wasted no time in gaining access to the nuclear reactor and stealing more than 180 pounds of nuclear material for the creation of radiological bombs". He was subsequently sued by the university for libel, with the lawyer representing the university in the case saying that, "Mr. Williams' allegations about McMaster are on a par with UFO reports and JFK conspiracy theories...the notion that because there are people on faculty from Egypt that McMaster is then a haven for terrorism is not only logically offensive, it smacks of racism."[tpl]cite news|title=McMaster's atomic PR fight|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=84126f69-db8a-441d-ae94-f2c7dcec05b9&p=1|newspaper=National Post[/tpl] The publisher later apologized for allowing Williams to print statements which "were without basis in fact".[tpl]cite book |last=Pither |first=Kerry |title=Dark Days: The Story of Four Canadians Tortured in the Name of Fighting Terror |year=2008 |location=Toronto |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-670-06853-1 [/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]el-Maati, Ahmed Barbara Jackman.

CATEGORIES: Living people, 1928 births, American urban planners

Lee E. Koppelman (born 1928) dominated planning on Long Island from the 1960s until his May 2006 resignation from the Long Island Regional Planning Board.http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/1035472261.html?dids=1035472261:1035472261&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=May+12%2C+2006&author=KATIE+THOMAS.+STAFF+WRITER&pub=Newsday&edition=Combined+editions&startpage=A.08&desc=He+didn%27t+plan+for+this%2C+Iconic+leader+of+LI+planning+board+steps+down+amid+questions+about+group%27s+financeshttp://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/1062354761.html?dids=1062354761:1062354761&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+19%2C+2006&author=KATIE+THOMAS.+STAFF+WRITER&pub=Newsday&edition=Combined+editions&startpage=A.07&desc=Portrait+of+the+planner%2C+Lee+Koppelman+drew+up+much+of+Long+Island%2C+but+his+resignation+wasnt+part+of+the+planhttp://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/1037713031.html?dids=1037713031:1037713031&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=May+17%2C+2006&author=JOHN+V.N.+KLEIN.+John+V.+N.+Klein%2C+a+former+Suffolk+County+executive%2C+is+a+partner+in+the+Mineola+law+firm+of+Meyer%2C+Suozzi%2C+English+and+Klein.&pub=Newsday&edition=Combined+editions&startpage=A.35&desc=Long+Island+was+part+of+his+plan%2C+Lee+Koppelman+helped+the+region+anticipate+the+future+with+his+vision+of+long-term+planning  At age 78, in 2006, he still served as director of State University of New York at Stony Brook's Center for Regional Policy Studies. 
Dr, Koppelman is regarded as the father of sustainability on Long Island for he was the first of the power players to conceptualize the idea of preserving space in the interest of health and future generations.  This was at a time when the main goal was to sell all of the remaining land and sustainability was not even a word. 
Koppelman drew up influential Master Plans for Long Island in 1969-70.ProQuest Archiver: Newspaper Home However, some of their most ambitious features remained "on the drawing board" - such as (1) an "instant city" to be constructed in the general vicinity of the Long Island Expressway's Exit 68 (William Floyd Parkway intersection, near Yaphank; (2) a major commercial airport serving the New York City market, to be located at the site of an existing military airfield, either at Calverton or Westhampton; (3) at least one bridge across the Long Island Sound, and (4) a new North Shore parkway running parallel to the Long Island Expressway in Suffolk County. (Source: Articles by Karl Grossman in the Long Island Press, 1969 and 1970, not available online.) 
The first three were revived, and presented to the public as brand-new proposals, by the Long Island development lobby between 1988 and 1992. The "instant city", proposed anew by developer Wilbur Breslin, became a sprawling [tpl]convert|2100|acre|km2|0|sing=on[/tpl] mixed-use dream, nicknamed "WillyWorld", dominated by a giant shopping mall. A proposal for an air freight facility at the US Navy / Grumman property in Calverton http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/77502857.html?dids=77502857&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&date=Feb+20%2C+1992&author=By+Thomas+McAteer.+Thomas+McAteer%2C+a+former+chief&pub=Newsday&edition=Combined+editions&startpage=95&desc=Calverton+Airport%27s+Potential+Boon+It+could+bring+an+economic+bonanza+to+the+East+End., and a high-speed ferry between Wading River and New Haven, Connecticut,Subsidies `Vital' in Ferry Plan were candidly described in L.I. Business News and Newsday editorials, respectively, as first steps towards the long-awaited major passenger jetport and cross-Sound bridge, both vehemently opposed by "NIMBY" groups since they were first advocated by Dr. Koppelman and others circa 1969. As of early 2006, these projects all remain in the proposal stage. (Dozens of articles on each "new" proposal in Newsday online archives, especially 1989-1994.)
Although primarily identified, in the public mind, with the schemes of the "development lobby", Dr. Koppelman has also played a leading role in preserving open space, particularly in the parklands purchased by Suffolk County around 1970. Research supervised by Dr. Koppelman identified road run-off ("non-point-source pollution") as the leading cause of deteriorating water qualitiy in local aquifers and estuaries, indicating an urgent need to limit the amount of paved-over  area in coastal environments.http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nytimes/121559788.html?did=121559788&FMT=ABS&FMTS=AI&date=Jul+9%2C+1978&author=By+ROY+R.+SILVER&pub=New+York+Times++(1857-Current+file)&desc=Plan+Seeks+to+Guard+Quality+of+Long+Island+Waterhttp://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F4091FF73E5C0C738EDDAB0994D9484D81 In the early 1990s, he publicly opposed the "WillyWorld" shopping mall proposal, on the grounds that enough other similar projects were already in the works. In general, Koppelman's environmental initiatives left a lasting legacy, while his major development proposals went nowhere, or were overwhelmed by the chaotic clutter of suburban sprawl.
Dr. Koppelman is the author, with Joseph De Chiara, of standard texts on planning, widely used in graduate schools: Urban Planning and Design Criteria (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1982), and Site Planning Standards (McGraw Hill Co., 1978).  Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) nominated Koppelman for a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004.Congressman Steve Israel : Home  Koppelman also serves as a professor in Stony Brook University's graduate program in Public Policy.
Koppelman's long conversations with Newsday reporter Robert Caro inspired Caro's biography of Robert Moses, The Power Broker, which depicted the elderly Moses as basically a has-been megalomaniac (while promoting Koppelman as a brilliant up-and-coming planner). Ironically, Dr. Koppelman seemed to follow the older planner's footsteps in his own later years, with numerous honors, titles, and salaries but commanding diminished respect among his fellow "power brokers". In 1992, a civic activist discovered that a Koppelman-led feasibility study of the Calverton air freight proposal http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/102605250.html?dids=102605250:102605250&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+23%2C+1991&author=&pub=Newsday&edition=Combined+editions&startpage=46&desc=Calverton+Airport%3F+It%27s+far+from+clear+that+the+end+of+LI+is+the+right+place+for+a+major+air-freight+terminal,http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/77565638.html?dids=77565638:77565638&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+17%2C+1992&author=By+Tom+Morris.+STAFF+WRITER&pub=Newsday&edition=Combined+editions&startpage=37&desc=Modest%27+Interest+in+Jetport had claimed that Lufthansa was interested in opening operations at the site - on the basis of one cold call, answered by a random blue-collar employee, who had in effect merely agreed with the caller that Calverton sounded like a nice place.Jetport Survey Said Skewed

[[Peter Pirsch]]
CATEGORIES: People from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Firefighting, Emergency services equipment makers

Peter Pirsch (b. ) founded Pirsch and Sons, Incorporated, a Kenosha, Wisconsin based manufacturer of fire apparatus. Pirsch was very successful from the 1920s through the 1980s. The Memphis, Tennessee Fire Department and the Washington DC Fire Department were both particularly loyal customers of Pirsch fire trucks. [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Peter Pirsch was the son of a pioneer Wisconsin wagon builder who patented a compound trussed extension ladder in 1899 and went on to make hand- and horsedrawn ladder trucks. His first motorized ladder truck was on a Rambler chassis, and this was followed by others based on Couple Gear, White, Duplex, Nash and Dodge. In 1926 came the first complete Peter Pirsch fire engines; these were 150 to 750gpm pumpers, chemical and hose trucks powered by 6-cylinder Waukesha engines. In 1928 came a pumper with fully enclosed cab, the first of its kind from a major US manufacturer, and in 1931 a one man operation hydro-mechanical aerial ladder hoist used on an 85 ft articulated ladder truck. By this time Pirsch were building mostly on their own chassis, although others occasionally used were Sterling (1933), International (1936) and Diamond T (1937). Cabs were bought from General Motors for many years. In 1938 came the first 100 ft aluminum alloy closed lattice aerial ladder which became a Peter Pirsch specialty and is still used today.
Throughout the 1930s and 1940s a wide range of fire engines, including articulated ladder trucks were made, with power coming mostly from Hercules or Waukesha engines. All these had their engines under hoods, and the first cab forward model came in 1961 with a flat-fronted cab which is still used today. Conventionals and cab-forwards were made through the 1960s with little change, and Pirsch were also offering their specialties on other chassis such as Ford and Mack CF. Very few conventionals were made after 1970, and current production centers on rigid and articulated cab-forward units, mostly with diesel engines. 
Pirsch and Sons supplied many of the fire trucks sold throughout the State of Georgia from 1950 until 1980, with their first regional distributor being the Harold Hancock Company of Atlanta, followed by the Charles L. McLarty Company of Decatur, GA.  Atlanta Georgia, and surrounding cities and towns bought dozens of Pirsch trucks supplied by these two local businesses.
Pirsch and Sons discontinued production of their trucks in the early 1980s after reorganization of the company, with the last truck coming off the line in 1987. The last Pirsch is currently owned by a rural volunteer fire department in Shohola, PA.

The Whitehaven Fire Department was annexed by Memphis, TN.  in 1969.  Whitehaven was a big fan of Pirsch trucks,  See many images of Pirsch at whitehavenfiredepartment.org.

[[Ertingen]]
CATEGORIES: Biberach (district)

Ertingen is a municipality in the district of Biberach in Upper Swabia, South Württemberg, Germany. Since the reform of 1975 it comprises Ertingen and the smaller communities, Erisdorf and Binzwangen, which had been independent before. Every of those communities can look back to a long history.
Having been largely agricultural in the past, the three communities have developed into places with a mixed population, consisting largely of industrial workers.
Owing to her companies whose performance is far above average, especially Ertingen has acquired the function of a centre of commerce and industry for the region.
In the course of time a large number of jobs in non-agricultural fields have been created. But there is still demand for jobs in trade and industry.
Ertingen will probably be rated as a so-called "subcentre" in the future regional planning.
Ertingen offers outstanding public services, like primary and secondary schools, a swimming pool, a nursing home with 48 beds, kindergartens, and an adult education centre.
The "Schwarzachtalseen" (Lakes in the Valley of the Black River) offer recreational facilities, especially for surfing, swimming and fishing. There are two seas for recreation and sports, and two "natural" seas for the preservation of nature.
The large forest areas of the community (6,6 km²) offer recreation, too. The "blind lake" is a favourite target for hikers.
More than 40 clubs show the high social involvement of the citizens, also visible from the numerous festivities.
One of the highlights of Ertingen folklore is the "fastnet", the special form of carnival of Suebia, with its traditional processions, costumes and ceremonies. As Carnival traditions may vary considerably from village to village, it should be mentioned that the Ertingen tradition is marked by the so-called "Daiberhexen"  (witches), the "gloggasaeger"  (literally "bell-sawers"), and the "Röthenbächler" (named after a stream in Erisdorf which once powered a water mill. These carnival associations are famous for their colourful costumes and  masks in all Upper Suebia.

[[Celine's laws]]
CATEGORIES: Anarchist fiction, Discordianism, Libertarian science fiction, Political philosophy, Political theories

Celine's Laws are a series of three laws regarding government and social interaction attributed to the fictional character Hagbard Celine from Robert Anton Wilson's and Robert Shea's Illuminatus! Trilogy. Celine, a gentleman anarchist, serves as a mouthpiece for Wilson's libertarian, anarchist and sometimes completely uncategorizable ideas about the nature of mankind. Celine's Laws are outlined in the trilogy by a manifesto titled Never Whistle While You're Pissing. Wilson later goes on to elaborate on the laws in his nonfiction book, Prometheus Rising, as being inherent consequences of average human psychology.
A piece entitled Celine's Laws appears in Robert Anton Wilson's The Illuminati Papers, which features articles written by Wilson under the guise of many of his characters from  The Illuminatus! Trilogy alongside interviews with the author himself.  One article pulls from another, as well as from the original Trilogy.
Celine, in his manifesto, recognizes these are generalities, but also says that their basic principles can be used to find the source of every great decline and fall of nations, and goes on to claim they are as universal as Newton's Laws in applying to everything.

Giuseppe Valentini (14 December 1681 – November 1753), nicknamed Straccioncino (Little Ragamuffin), was an Italian violinist, painter, poet, and composer, though he is known chiefly as a composer of inventive instrumental music. He studied under Giovanni Bononcini in Rome between 1692 and 1697. From 1710 to 1727 he served as ‘Suonator di Violino, e Componitore di Musica’ to Prince Michelangelo Caetani. He also succeeded Corelli as director of the concertino at San Luigi dei Francesi, from 1710 to 1741. Though during his lifetime overshadowed by the likes of Corelli, Vivaldi, and Locatelli, his contribution to Italian baroque music is noteworthy, and many of his works were published throughout Europe.

He discovered and first characterized E. coli DNA ligase, a key enzyme of genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology.
Olivera graduated from the University of the Philippines in 1960. He got a PhD from the California Institute of Technology (1966) in Biophysical Chemistry, followed by postdoctoral work at Stanford University from 1966-1968. In 1970, he moved to the University of Utah, where he is now a Distinguished Professor of Biology.

He is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor, has been elected into the Institute of Medicine and the American Philosophical Society, and became an Elected Member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2009. 
His impressive research on both DNA biophysics and conotoxins has enabled Dr. Olivera to serve as an editorial board member of various scientific publications. He served as a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Biological Chemistry from 1982 to 1987, the Journal of Toxinology – Toxin Reviews from 1990 to 1993, and Toxicon from 2000 until the present. In addition, he was a member of the review committee of the journal Cellular and Molecular Basis of Disease from 1982 to 1986. Dr Olivera has also served as a committee member of various institutions. He was a member of the Visiting Committee of the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry of Harvard University from 1988 to 1995, the Advisory Committee to the Director of the National Institutes of Health from 1996 to 1999, the Toxicology Advisory Committee of the Burroughs-Wellcome Foundation from 1999 to 2001, and has been a member of the Searle Scholars Advisory Board since 2007.
On July 9, 2007, UP honored Olivera, for his research on neuropharmacology using the venom of conesnails (carnivorous, predatory marine snails which thrive in tropical and subtropical habitats).

CATEGORIES: University of Cincinnati, Art schools in Ohio, Arts in Cincinnati, Ohio, Educational institutions established in 1819

The University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning, commonly referred to as DAAP, is a college of the University of Cincinnati. Located in the university's main campus in Cincinnati, Ohio, DAAP is consistently ranked as one of the most prestigious design schools in the U.S. and the world.  The University of Cincinnati was also the only public school listed in I.D. Magazine's list of the top ten design schools worldwide.
For 2005, the graduate architecture program was ranked second in the nation after Harvard and ranked as the most innovative architecture program in the nation. Two of "The New York Five" architects attended the University of Cincinnati: Michael Graves and John Hejduk (though Hejduk did not ultimately graduate from the program).
In 2008, the interior design program was ranked first in the nation for the ninth consecutive year in "America's Best Architecture & Design Schools,", published by DesignIntelligence. New to the list in 2006 was the school's industrial design program ranking at No. 2, besting the Center for Creative Studies in Detroit and second only to the prestigious Art Center College of Design in California. The combination of these three top-ranking disciplines gave the college of DAAP the title as the Best Art College in the nation.
In 2012, Business Insider ranked the world’s best 25 design schools listing DAAP as third, second only to RISD and MIT.
The college is also known for having the only School of Planning in the U.S. to have accredited programs at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate levels. Born out of the School of Architecture in 1961, their postgraduate degrees have been ranked at near the top in the Midwest as well as in the top 20 nationwide.
The college is distinguished for its mandatory co-operative education program, which was first conceived at the University of Cincinnati College of Engineering in 1906. Students alternate between working as paid employees in design firms and attending classes, giving them experience that enables them to easily enter the workplace after graduation. Students are required to spend a certain amount of time in the workplace, usually adding up to several years of job experience, before they are able to graduate. This extends most of the programs that would normally be four-year programs into five or more years.

French legislative elections took place on 23 and 30 June 1968 to elect the 4th French National Assembly of the Fifth Republic. They were held in the aftermath of the events of May 1968. On 30 May 1968, in a radio speech, President Charles de Gaulle, who had vanished for three days (he was in Baden-Baden, Germany), announced the dissolution of the National Assembly, and a new legislative election, by way of restoring order.
While the workers went back to their jobs, Prime Minister Georges Pompidou campaigned for the "defence of the Republic" in the face of the "communist threat" and called for the "silent majority" to make themselves heard. The Left was divided. The Communists reproached the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left (FGDS) leader François Mitterrand for not having consulted it before he announced his candidacy in the next presidential election, and for the formation of a provisional government led by Pierre Mendès-France. The Far-Left and the Unified Socialist Party protested against the passivity of the left-wing parties. The Gaullist Union for the Defence of the Republic became the first party in the French Republic's history to obtain an absolute parliamentary majority. The FGDS disintegrated. 
However, the relation between the two heads of the executive power had deteriorated during the crisis. One month later, Georges Pompidou resigned and was replaced by Maurice Couve de Murville.

It is also referred to as the [tpl]Nihongo|JR Yumesaki Line|JRゆめ咲線|[/tpl]. The entire line lies within Konohana-ku, Osaka, and connects the Osaka Loop Line to Universal Studios Japan.
The nickname "Yumesaki Line" was determined in a public poll upon the opening of Universal Studios Japan and the Universal City station. While it was not the number one choice, its pleasant sound together with the vision of the area around the Sakurajima Line and USJ being a place where Osaka's dreams were continuing to be born made it the perfect choice.
The line is used primarily by a mix of factory workers and tourists. There is also freight traffic running between Suita and Ajikawaguchi.

Llyn Mair (Welsh  for 'Mary's lake') is a [tpl]convert|14|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] artificial lake located at [tpl]gbmappingsmall|SH652412[/tpl] in North Wales.  It lies in the area of Tan-y-Bwlch, a little above Plas Tan-y-Bwlch, and is in the catchment area of the River Dwyryd. It was created by William Edward Oakeley (of Plas Tan-y-bwlch) as a 21st birthday present to his daughter Mair and as a water supply.[tpl]when|date=August 2010[/tpl] 
Nearby Plas Tan y Bwlch was believed to be the first house in North Wales to be lit by electricity from its own hydro-electric source, this during the 1890s. This was generated by a form of Pelton wheel, fed from Llyn Mair by means of a pipeline. The small power house was on the hillside immediately behind the house and is said to have operated until after the opening of Maentwrog public hydro-electric power station in 1928.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/a-sense-of-place/history-of-snowdonia/plas-tan-y-bwlch-history |title=Plas Tan y Bwlch History |publisher=Eryri-npa.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14[/tpl]  In June 2013 a new hydro-scheme, costing £400,000, and similarly tapping the water from Llyn Mair, was opened. The water falls 60m to the turbine, and is expected to meet most of the Plas's electricity needs.Post Prynhawn, Radio Cymru, 13-6-2013
The lake is set alongside the B4410 road, a minor road linking the village of Rhyd. The position of the lake bordered with ancient oak woods and its tranquil appearance makes this a popular picnic site for visitors and it also provides a starting point for a number of local country walks. There is some limited parking available just off the road.
The narrow gauge Ffestiniog Railway runs through the woods above the lake and Tan-y-Bwlch railway station can be reached on foot from the lake.
The lake also has a notable echo because of the shape of the surrounding hills.

CATEGORIES: Icaricia, Fauna of the Northwestern United States, Natural history of Oregon

Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi syn. Plebejus icarioides fenderiPlebejus icarioides fenderi. NatureServe. 2012.) is an endangered subspecies of butterfly endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon, United States. The species was first documented in the 1920s and was described to science in 1931 by biologist Ralph Macy. He named it for his friend, Kenneth Fender, an entomologist and mail carrier. The species was not seen after the 1930s and was presumed extinct. Small populations were rediscovered in 1989. Its eponym, Fender, had died two years earlier.News release: endangered butterfly needs proper habitat, special nectar. Public Affairs & Communications. University of California, Santa Barbara. June 8, 2000. In January 2000, Fender's blue butterfly was added to the Endangered Species List by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The largest known populations now exist in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge.
Fender's blue butterfly is host-specific on Kincaid's lupine, a rare subspecies of the common sulphur lupine. The adult deposits its eggs on the plant in spring. After emerging and feeding, the larva winters in the root system. In spring it continues to feed before undergoing metamorphosis. As an adult it lives for no more than ten days, during which time it mates and the female seeks Kincaid's lupines on which to oviposit. The lupine's habitat has been reduced by agriculture and urbanization, and only isolated and protected lands support enough area for populations to persist.

[[Hislop]]

Hislop is an English, Scottish and Irish name in origin. The name itself belongs to the class of topographic surnames, which were given to people who resided near physical features such as hills, streams, churches or types of trees. The surname Hislop is derived from the Old English word haesel and the Old Norse word helsi, which both mean hazel, and from the Old English word hop which refers to a valley or hollow between two hills.[tpl]cite web|last=Swyrich Coropration|title=Hislop Family Crest and Name History|url=http://www.houseofnames.com/hislop-family-crest|accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl]
The earliest records are first found in Yorkshire where they held a family seat from times before the Norman Conquest and the arrival of Duke Williams at Hastings in 1066 A.D.

[[Isobaric loudspeaker]]

CATEGORIES: Loudspeakers

The Isobaric loudspeaker configuration was first introduced by Harry F. Olson in the early 1950s, and refers to systems in which
two or more identical woofers (bass drivers) operate simultaneously, with a common body of enclosed air adjoining one side of each diaphragm.  In practical applications, they are most often used to improve low-end frequency response without increasing cabinet size, though at the expense of cost and weight.
The name is derived from the term Isobar ("equal pressure"), which comes from the Greek word "isobares", meaning "of equal weight".Chambers entry for Isobar  As the word implies, the enclosed air does indeed experience roughly equal pressures from each diaphragm it contacts, but those forces are actually parallel, rather than opposing, so the air is forced to move.

[[Ancient Diocese of Uzès]]
CATEGORIES: Bishops of Uzès, Former Roman Catholic dioceses in France

The Ancient Diocese of Uzès is a former Roman Catholic diocese in France.  From the arrival of Christianity in the 5th century until the French Revolution the southern French city of Uzès was the seat of a bishop, a competitor to the local lords.
The first historically verified Bishop of Uzès was Constantius, who was present at the Council of Vaison in 442. Other notable bishops were the fourth, Saint Firminus (541-53), who is locally venerated as Saint Firmin and whose relics remain in Uzès Cathedral (dedicated to Saint Theodoritus (Saint Théodorit), martyr, and patron saint of the town), and who was venerated as a patron saint against plague, and Saint Ferreol (553-81).
As the power of territorial magnates dispersed, the bishops obtained the right to strike coinage, a sure sign of their secular power, and the seigneurial right to dispense justice. In the 13th century, at the height of the see's power, the bishop was able to purchase a part of the signory of Uzès. Guillaume de Grimoard du Roure officiated as bishop of Uzès before becoming Pope Urban V.
Like many cloth-manufacturing centers (Uzès manufactues serge), the city and the surrounding countryside were strongly Protestant during the Wars of Religion in the 16th century, which wreaked havoc in the Languedoc regions, and Bishop Jean de Saint Gelais (1531–60) became a Calvinist. Many of the city's churches were burned by Huguenots and only two remain. 
The celebrated missionary Bridaine, (1701–67), was a native of the diocese of Uzès. For seventy days the little city was the fortified residence of Cardinal Pacca, after his confinement at Fenestrelles (1812). The town of Pont Saint Esprit, on the Rhône, owes its names to a bridge built there between 1265 and 1309 with the proceeds of a general collection made by the monks. 
After the bishopric of Nîmes was re-established as a separate diocese in 1821, a Papal Brief of 27 April 1877, granted to its bishop the right to add Alais and Uzès to their bishopric, with the two dioceses being combined with that of Nîmes.

Ulmus laciniata (Trautv.) Mayr, known variously as the Manchurian, Cut-leaf, or Lobed Elm, is a deciduous tree native to the humid ravine forests of Japan, Korea, northern China, eastern Siberia and Sakhalin, growing alongside Cerciphyllum japonicum, Aesculus turbinata, and Pterocarya rhoifolia,Sasaki, Y. (1979) Der Verband Pterocaryon rhoifoliae in Japan. In: Vegetation und Landschaft Japans. Eds: Miyawaki, A., and Okuda, S. Bull. Yokohama Phytosoc. Soc. Japan. 16, 1979. pp. 213-226Ohwi, J. (1984).

The tree is similar to the Wych Elm Ulmus glabra, and was originally treated as such by Houtzagers and Henry, but later accorded species status of its own largely by reason of the enormous disjunction in their respective areas; U. glabra extending across Europe as far as the Urals, several thousand kilometres from U. laciniata in the Far East.

The following music singles are from the anime series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya sung by the voice actors for the three main female and two main male characters in the series along with four other supporting female characters, making the total number of character albums nine in all. The first three released included songs by Aya Hirano as Haruhi Suzumiya, Minori Chihara as Yuki Nagato and Yuko Goto as Mikuru Asahina. Moreover, two additional character CDs were released on December 6, 2006, sung by Yuki Matsuoka as Tsuruya and Natsuko Kuwatani as Ryōko Asakura. Two more character CDs were released on January 24, 2007, sung by Sayaka Aoki as Kyon's Sistercdjapan.co.jp for Kyon's Sister's CD and Yuri Shiratori as Emiri Kimidori.cdjapan.co.cp for Emiri Kimidori's CD  Finally, the CDs for Itsuki Koizumi and Kyon were released on February 21, 2007.
Each of the nine singles feature the ending theme song "Hare Hare Yukai". Other than the three main female character's versions which are solo cover versions of the original, there are some alterations. For Tsuruya's version as well as Ryōko's version, the lyrics were changed to fit the character; Tsuruya's version contains her catch phrase "nyoro", while Ryōko reverses the optimistic lyrics to convey futility and destruction. However, while Tsuruya's and Ryōko's versions have the same arrangements as the original version, the last four released have their arrangements changed along with the lyrics. Kyon's Sister's version is very upbeat; Emiri's version is very fact-based; Itsuki's version talks about his ESP; and Kyon reflects about his now-disturbed life in his version.

The second season of So You Think You Can Dance premiered May 25, 2006, with new host Cat Deeley.
On August 16, Benji Schwimmer was announced as the winner of season 2 and received the grand prize of $100,000, a new hybrid SUV, and a one-year contract with Celine Dion's Las Vegas show, A New Day....  Schwimmer almost did not make the show's top 20 — he was officially first runner-up dancer in case any of the male dancers ran into unforeseen difficulties prior to the start of filming. As it happened, for the second year in a row, Hokuto Konishi was unable to get his visa cleared to work in the U.S. in time for the first taping, and he was cut.  Schwimmer took his spot in the Top 20 and fared well from the start, garnering consistent praise from the judges and votes from viewers.  Schwimmer and fellow grand finalist Donyelle Jones, who were paired as a couple from the first performance episode, became the first contestants in the show's run to never face elimination from being in the bottom six or bottom 4 dancers.

CATEGORIES: Bamberg (district)

Baunach is a town in the Upper Franconian district of Bamberg and the seat of the administrative community (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft) of Baunach. Until administrative reform in 1972, Baunach belonged to the Lower Franconian district of Ebern.
Baunach calls itself the “Franconian Three-River Town” because it lies on the rivers Baunach, Lauter and Main. These three rivers are depicted in the town’s coat of arms, in which a golden pike lies over the three rivers. In 2002, the town celebrated its 1,200-year jubilee. Moreover, the river Itz flows through the community area. 
The name Baunach comes from the Indo-Germanic word for river: bunahu. This may be translated as “swelling water”. For thousands of years the entire region near Baunach has been populated by Celts and Franconians.

The Gran Premio de Madrid is an international horse race which is held in the “Hipódromo de la Zarzuela” racetrack . The race is designated for colts and fillies three years and older. It is a 2,500-metre race.
An earlier Gran Premio de Madrid, for 3 year olds over 2500 meters, was instituted in 1881 at the old Castellana race course (Hipódromo de la Castellana). It was first called the Gran Premio de Madrid, changed to the Gran Premio Nacional, and then La Copa de su Majesdad el Rey. The modern-day Gran Premio de Madrid is considered to have been instituted in 1919, first held at Casa Real el Hipódromo de Aranjuez/Legamarejo; it was opened to older horses, and intended as an international race. It was moved to the Hipódromo de la Castellana until that racecourse closed in 1933. In 1933 it returned to its original venue at Aranjuez, and in 1934-35 was run at San Sebastián. In 1941 it was moved to the new Hipódromo de la Zarzuela. La Zarzuela went bankrupt in 1994, and the race was not held until new management re-opened the course in 2006. In 2006, after a 13 year hiatus, a 2,400-metre Gran Premio de Madrid was run, and the new weight conditions were 59.5 kilograms for 4 years and older and 52 kilograms for 3 years of age.

There were two sections: the Muslim section was at the base of Mount Vernon, bounded by Upper Aljunied Road, Upper Serangoon Road, and Bartley Road; the Christian section was across Upper Aljunied Road from the Muslim section, and bounded by Upper Serangoon Road as well.
Apart from being a place of remembrance, the trails inside Bidadari Cemetery used to be very popular as a running route for members of the Gurkha Contingent. Bidadari Cemetery is no longer in use, and most of the graves have been exhumed for redevelopment. Woodleigh MRT Station now occupies part of the former site.
The cemetery was a burial site of Augustine Podmore Williams, an English sailor, on whose life writer Joseph Conrad based his novel Lord Jim. Burials were not permitted after 1972, the same year that the Mount Vernon Crematorium and Columbarium was opened, which too eventually closed in 2004 due to redevelopment plans drawn up by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).

[[Potential vorticity]]

CATEGORIES: Oceanography

Potential vorticity (PV) is a quantity which is proportional to the dot product of vorticity and stratification that, following a parcel of air or water, can only be changed by diabatic or frictional processes. It is a useful concept for understanding the generation of vorticity in cyclogenesis (the birth and development of a cyclone), especially along the polar front, and in analyzing flow in the ocean.
It is also useful in tracing intrusions of stratospheric air deep into the troposphere in the vicinity of jet streaks, a concentrated region within a jet stream where the wind speeds are the strongest. It acts as a flow tracer in the ocean as well. It can also be used to explain how a range of mountains like the Andes can make the upper westerly winds swerve towards the equator and back.
Baroclinic instability requires the presence of a potential vorticity gradient along which waves amplify during cyclogenesis.

An apartment hotel (also aparthotel and apartel) is a serviced apartment complex that uses a hotel-style booking system. It is similar to renting an apartment, but with no fixed contracts and occupants can "check-out" whenever they wish.
The standard zoning definition in the United States[tpl]where|date=August 2010[/tpl] is:
"Apartment hotel means a building designed for or containing both apartments and individual guestrooms or rental units, under resident supervision, and which maintains an inner lobby through which all tenants must pass to gain access to apartments, rooms or units."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
An apartment hotel complex usually offers a complete fully fitted apartment. These complexes are usually custom built, and similar to a hotel complex containing a varied amount of apartments. The length of stay in these apartment hotels is varied with anywhere from a few days to months or even years.  The people who stay in apartment hotels use them as long-term accommodation; therefore, the hotels are often fitted with most things the average home would require.

CATEGORIES: Free system software, Free software programmed in Python, Python libraries, BBC Research & Development

Kamaelia is a  free software/open source Python-based systems-development tool and concurrency framework produced by BBC Research.
Kamaelia applications are produced by linking independent components together. These components communicate entirely through "inboxes" and "outboxes" (queues) largely removing the burdens of thread-safety and IPC from the developer. This also makes components reusable in different systems, allows easy unit testing and results in parallelism (between components) by default.
Components are generally implemented as generators - a method more light-weight than allocating a thread to each (though this is also supported). As a result, switching between the execution of components in Kamaelia systems is very fast.
Applications that have been produced using Kamaelia include a Freeview digital video recorder, a network-shared whiteboard, a 3D GUI, an HTTP Server, an audio mixer, a stream multicasting system and a simple BitTorrent client.Kamaelia BitTorrent and HTTP components

The project was successfully completed in late 2013, which involved migrating 15,000 personal computers and laptops of public employees to free and open source software using the Linux distribution "LiMux" (an Ubuntu derivative) as the operating system and LibreOffice as the primary productivity software.http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/321474/switching-linux-saves-munich-over-11-million The project initially had used OpenOffice, but has since switched to LibreOffice.http://www.it-muenchen-blog.de/2012/10/libre-office-fur-munchen/ The city reports in addition to gaining freedom in software decisions and increased security, it has also saved €11.7 million (US$16 million).http://www.giraffedog.com/blog/ubuntu-linux-hints-tips/city-munich-successfully-ditches-microsoft-favour-linux-open-source/

[[Rendezvous pitch maneuver]]

CATEGORIES: Space Shuttle program, Orbital maneuvers

The  R-bar pitch maneuver (RPM), popularly called the  rendezvous pitch maneuver, was a maneuver performed by the space shuttle as it rendezvoused with the International Space Station (ISS) prior to docking. The shuttle performed a backflip that exposed its heat-shield to the crew of the ISS that made photographs of it. Based on the information gathered during the rendezvous pitch maneuver, the mission team could decide that the orbiter was not safe for re-entry. They may have then decided either to wait on the ISS for a rescue mission or attempt extra-vehicular activity to repair the heat shield and secure the safe re-entry of the orbiter. This was a standard procedure for all space shuttles docking to the International Space Station after the Columbia accident, caused by a damaged heat shield.

It is situated in the southern end of Yell Sound, between the Mainland, Shetland at Mossbank and the island of Yell.

To the north west of Samphrey is Bunglan, which was once an island in its own right, but has become silted up by two tombolos, which now connect it to Samphrey. There is a small loch between Bunglan and Samphrey proper, which can just about be seen on the aerial picture.

[[Trochodendron aralioides]]
CATEGORIES: Trochodendrales

Trochodendron aralioides, sometimes colloquially called "wheel tree", is a flowering plant and the sole living species in the genus Trochodendron, which also includes several extinct species. It was also often considered the sole species in the family Trochodendraceae, though botanists now include the distinct genus Tetracentron in the same family. T. aralioides is native to Japan, southern Korea and Taiwan. 
It is an evergreen tree or large shrub growing to 20 m tall. The leaves are borne in tight spirals at the apex of the years' growth, each leaf leathery dark green, simple broad lanceolate, 6-14 cm long and 3-8 cm broad, with a crenate margin. The flowers are produced 10-20 together in a racemose cyme 5-13 cm diameter; each flower is 15-18 mm diameter, yellowish green, without petals, but with a conspicuous ring of 40-70 stamens surrounding the 4-11 carpels. The fruit is 2 cm diameter, woody, star-shaped, composed of 4-11 follicles, each follicle containing several seeds.
Trochodendron aralioides shares with Tetracentron the very unusual feature in angiosperms, of lacking vessel elements in its wood. This has long been considered a very primitive character, resulting in the classification of these two genera in a basal position in the angiosperms; however, genetic research by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has shown it to be in a less basal position (early in the eudicots), suggesting the absence of vessel elements is a secondarily evolved character, not a primitive one.

Denmark Street is a short narrow road in central London, notable for its connections with British popular music, and is known as the British Tin Pan Alley.http://www.hanksguitarshop.com/history.aspxhttp://blog.justgreatguitars.com/index.php/been-guitar-shopping-in-londons-denmark-st/ The road connects Charing Cross Road at its western end with St Giles High Street at its eastern end. Denmark Street is in the London Borough of Camden.
Denmark Street appears on surveys from the 1730s. The area around it was known as 'the Rookery', a part of London that had developed in the 18th century as an unplanned slum to the west of the City. Though much of the area was cleared by the end of the 19th century, Denmark Street is one of the few roads in London to retain 17th century terraced facades on both sides. A small court connected by passages (known as Denmark Place) runs along the back of the north side of the street.
Venues on Denmark Street have strong connections with the histories of British jazz, rhythm and blues and punk music. Jimi Hendrix recorded in basements in the street. Elton John wrote his classic early song "Your Song" here. Later, the Sex Pistols  lived above number 6, and recorded their first demos there. The street contains London's largest cluster of music shops. It was also the original home of London's biggest science fiction and comic store, Forbidden Planet.
The street was the scene of a fire (caused by arson by a disgruntled clubber who had been ejected and locked out) which killed 37 people in an illegal nightclub, on 16 August 1980

The Tasmanian Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis) is an extinct subspecies of the Emu. It was found on Tasmania where it had become isolated during the Late Pleistocene. As opposed to the other insular emu taxa, the King Island and the Kangaroo Island Emu, the population on Tasmania was sizable, meaning that there were no marked effects of small population size as in the other two isolates. Thus, the Tasmanian Emu had not progressed to the point where it could be considered a distinct species, and even its status as a distinct subspecies is not universally accepted as it agreed with the mainland birds in measurements and the external characters used to distinguish it - a whitish instead of black foreneck and throat and an unfeathered neck - apparently are also present, albeit rare, in some mainland birds. There are suggestions the bird was slightly smaller than the modern Emu, but in conflict, other evidence (including descriptions of Pleistocene remains) indicates that both are similar in size.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0018728[/tpl] Today, it is apparently only known from subfossil bones, the skins which once existed having been lost.

Lété Island is an island in the River Niger approx. 16 kilometres long and 4 kilometres wide, located  around 40 kilometres from the town of Gaya, Niger. Together with other smaller islands in the River Niger, it was the main object of a territorial dispute between Niger and Benin, which began when the two entities were still under French rule. The island, as well as seasonally flooded land around it, is valuable to semi-nomadic Puel cattle herders as a dry season pasturage.
[ref]
[tpl]rp|p.37[/tpl][/ref]
Niger and Benin almost went to war over their border in 1963 but finally chose to settle the dispute through peaceful means. In the early 1990s, a joint delimitation commission was tasked with solving the issue but could not reach an agreement. In 2001 the two parties chose to have the International Court of Justice rule conclusively on the matter. The Court ruled in Niger's favour in 2005.Fabio Spadi (2005) The ICJ Judgment in the Benin-Niger Border Dispute:  the interplay of titles and ‘effectivités’ under the uti possidetis juris principle, Leiden Journal of International Law 18: 777-794

Both were introduced at the Berlin Motor Show in February 1936. The 260 D was named in reference to its engine's cubic capacity. Nearly 2,000 vehicles were assembled until 1940, after which the Daimler-Benz group had to devote itself almost entirely to military manufacture. 
The 2545 cc overhead valve, 4-cylinder engine employed the Bosch diesel injection system and produced [tpl]Convert|45|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] at 3000 rpm. The car weighed approximately [tpl]Convert|1530|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and could attain a top speed of [tpl]Convert|95|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. 
The chassis was based on contemporary Mercedes technology and had transverse leaf spring independent front suspension and swing axles at the rear.  The brakes were hydraulic. A range of body types were made including saloons, landaulettes and cabriolets.
Two series were manufactured, 170 pullman-landaulets used only as taxis based on the W21 chassis, called the Nullserie from 1936 to 1937, with a three-speed plus overdrive transmission, without syncromesh on the first gear, and, from 1937 on, the regular production 260D based on the W143 chassis, with a four-speed fully synchronized transmission.
A surviving example of the car is displayed at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

[[Diagnosis (artificial intelligence)]]
CATEGORIES: Artificial intelligence

As a subfield in artificial intelligence, Diagnosis is concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to determine whether the behaviour of a system is correct.  If the system is not functioning correctly, the algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part of the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing.  The computation is based on observations, which provide information on the current behaviour.
The expression diagnosis also refers to the answer of the question of whether the system is malfunctioning or not, and to the process of computing the answer.  This word comes from the medical context where a diagnosis is the process of identifying a disease by its symptoms.

The NAMC J-12 (Chinese: 歼-12; NATO reporting name: unknown, if any) was a lightweight supersonic fighter built in the People's Republic of China for use by the PLAAF. It was one of first serious attempts taken by Chinese aircraft manufacturers to develop a modern jet fighter of indigenous design. Weighing 6,993 lb (3,172 kg) empty, it is one of the lightest jet fighters ever built. Neither the J-12 nor the related Shenyang J-11 (Not to be confused with the Shenyang J-11 Flanker B+ that entered service in 1998) entered service.
In 1969, the PLAAF issued a requirement for a small, inexpensive, STOL (short takeoff and landing) lightweight fighter to replace the MiG-19 then in service.[tpl]cite book | title = China Today: Aviation Industry | publisher = China Aviation Industry Press | year = 1989[/tpl] Two designs were submitted, the Shenyang J-11 and the Nanchang J-12. Design of the J-12 was led by Lu Xiao Peng, with the prototypes being built by the Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company (NAMC). Flight testing of the three prototypes began on December 26, 1970. Performance was disappointing, so additional prototypes were built with improvements such as simplified control surfaces, a lighter area ruled fuselage, and revised intake. All variants looked similar; the J-12 was a small single-seat jet fighter with a low-set swept wings, swept control surfaces, tubular fuselage, and nose intake with small or absent shock cone.
In 1977, development of the J-12 was abandoned, probably because the Chengdu J-7, based on the Soviet MiG-21F, was considered superior.  The J-12's main problems were insufficient firepower and engine thrust. The J-12 accumulated 61 hours in 135 flights by 1977. Nine J-12s are believed to have been built. In 1990s, Lu Xiao Peng proposed to upgrade J-12 fighter design to accommodate stealth features, and suggested modified J-12 fighter to be carrier based fighter for PLA Navy, in the none of the proposals turned into reality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/j-12-nan-chang-fighter-china-upgrade-stealth-version.htm |title=J12 fighter stealth modification | work=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=15 July 2011[/tpl]

Kelly Duda is an American filmmaker and activist from Arkansas. Duda spent seven years making Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal.
Variety magazine described Duda as "a pit bull with a bureaucratic bone" who "follows subjects fearlessly and ventures into hostile environs (and) comes away, most of the time, with the information he wants to get." Variety described Factor 8 as "hard-headed journalism" stating, "one of the things that hits the viewer in 'Factor 8' is that Ken Starr spent more than $40 million trying to pin something on then-President Bill Clinton, and missed what Duda found via sheer leg work."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117928863/|title=Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal|author=John Anderson|work=Variety|date=2005-05-15[/tpl] Duda experienced a significant amount of blow back in his native state of Arkansas as a result of his investigation, including claims of death threats, his tires being slashed, break-ins, files being stolen, and other things.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://search.opinionarchives.com/Summary/AmericanSpectator/V40I5P40-1.htm|title=Arkansas Blood Money|author=James W.

The American Film Institute remarked, "Kelly Duda's dedication to the truth is an inspiration—this expose wears his heart on its sleeve, refusing to let the victims die in vain."
Duda was also part of the team for Fuji Television that produced The Hepatitis C Epidemic: A 15-Year Government Cover-up. The program won a George Foster Peabody Award in 2003 and was reportedly watched by more than 12 million viewers in Japan.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.peabody.uga.edu/news/press_release.php?id=81|title=The Peabody Awards Winners|author=Noel Holston|date=2003-02-04[/tpl]

In fact, according to WM3IP's website at the time, very little of the donated funds collected by Lorri Davis via the WM3.org website had made its way to the defense teams for Misskelley and Baldwin, the "forgotten" other two members of the WM3.

Red Falcons was the name of various socialist children's organizations, popular in Europe and the United States which emerged during the First and Second World Wars. The first such group was founded in the early 20th century by Anton Tesarek, a socialist educator from Austria, under the name "Rote Falken." The origin of the name is unclear; one possible explanation is that the Falcon is a bird of prey with no imperial links (the eagle was the symbol of the German empire, adopted later by the Nazis.) It is red to symbolise socialism.

[[Endrizzi]]

CATEGORIES: Surnames

Endrizzi is an Italian family surname.
The Endrizzi surname occurs mostly in Northern Italy, in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol alpine region. Today, the many branches of the Endrizzi family can be found in Bolzano, Trento, Sarnonico, Cavedago, Cles, Dercolo, Spormaggiore and Fai della Paganella, these last mostly in the Val di Non region (Dolomiti di Brenta), where they live since the middle 16th century. In fact, it is rather famous in the whole world, due to the quality of the Fratelli Endrizzi fine wines, founded 1885.
It is a very old family, although bearing a rare surname in Italian, which seems to be a local spelling or modification from Endrici (a variation of de Enrici, Enrico being an old Italian patronymic of German origin, Heinrich) or Endrighi, which took place ca. 1525. Endrighi is the plural form of Endrigo (the surname of a famous Italian singer, Sergio Endrigo). Other spelling variants are Endrick, Endrissi and Endricci.
The root "Endr" is probably German in origin and come from Austria or Hungary (where the related surname Endröczi appears) in the beginning of the 19th century. The Endrizzi family migrated to the New World in small numbers, mostly to Austria, Brazil and the USA.

CATEGORIES: Dansband music, Swedish music

Dansband ("dance band") is a Swedish term for a band that plays dansbandsmusik ("dance band music"). Dansbandsmusik is often danced to in pairs. Jitterbug and foxtrot music are often included in this category. The music is primarily inspired by swing, schlager, country, jazz, and rock. The main influence for rock-oriented bands is the rock music of the 1950s and 1960s.
The terms dansband and dansbandsmusik were coined around 1970, when Swedish popular music developed a signature style. The genre developed primarily in Sweden, but has spread to neighbouring countries Denmark, Norway and the Swedish speaking regions of Finland. When the music came to Norway it was first called "Svensktoppar" (from the Swedish radio music chart Svensktoppen, which was a major arena for dansband music before its rules changed in January 2003).
A dansband often travels by bus, performing several times every week year-round, outdoors in the summertime and indoors in the wintertime. Performances may also be held on a boat.
Several dansbands are named after their lead singer (whose name is sometimes shortened), followed by orkester. The tradition origins from the old dance orchestras, often named after their Kapellmeister. The possessive suffix "s" is often replaced by "z" in dansband names. Some dansbands are named after earlier members.
The main audience for dansband music is middle-aged adults. The music is often performed live by the bands at venues where the main interest of the audience is dancing, rather than watching the performance on stage. However, many dansbands also record albums and singles.

The normal heart rhythm contains two audible heart sounds called S1 and S2 that give the well-known "lub-dub" rhythm; they are caused by the closing of valves in the heart.  
A gallop rhythm contains another sound, called S3 or S4, dependent upon where in the cycle this added sound comes. 
It can also contain both of these sounds forming a quadruple gallop, and in situations of very fast heart rate can produce a summation gallop where S3 and S4 occur so close as to be indistinguishable.

It was the last great culture of Văn Lang (as Vietnam was known then) and continued well into the next Vietnamese state of Âu Lạc. Its influence flourished to other parts of Southeast Asia, including the Maritime Southeast Asia from about 1000 BC to 1 BC.Vietnam ToursNola Cooke, Tana Li, James Anderson -  The Tongking Gulf Through History - Page 46 2011 -"Nishimura actually suggested the Đông Sơn phase belonged in the late metal age, and some other Japanese scholars argued that, contrary to the conventional belief that the Han invasion ended Đông Sơn culture, Đông Sơn artifacts, ..."Vietnam Fine Arts Museum 2000 "... the bronze cylindrical jars, drums, Weapons and tools which were sophistically carved and belonged to the World famous Đông Sơn culture dating from thousands of years; the Sculptures in the round, the ornamental architectural Sculptures ..."
The Đông Sơn people, who are also known as Lạc or Lạc Việt, were skilled at cultivating rice, keeping buffaloes and pigs, fishing and sailing with long dug-out canoes. They also were skilled bronze casters, which is evidenced by the Đông Sơn drums found widely in Southeast Asia and Southern China.
Similar artefacts have been found in Cambodia along the Mekong River dating back to the 4th millennium BC. Đông Sơn influence is seen throughout Southeast Asia, from the moko drum of Alor in Indonesia, which are suspected of originating with Đông Sơn bronze drums, to the design of keris knives.
To the south of the Đông Sơn culture was the proto-Cham Sa Huynh culture.

Natural Park of Penyal d'Ifac ([tpl]lang-va|Parc Natural del Penyal d'Ifac[/tpl], [tpl]lang-es|Parque Natural del Peñón de Ifach[/tpl]) is a natural park situated in Calpe (Calp), in the autonomous community of Valencia, Spain.
The Penyal d'Ifac is a massive limestone outcrop emerging from the sea and linked to the shore by  rock debris.  It is home to numerous rare plants, including a number of endemic species, and over 300 species of animals, and a nesting site for colonies of sea birds and other birds.
Rising to 332 metres high, the rock is a striking visual feature of the Mediterranean coastline. Historically it was known to the Phoenicians as the Northern Rock, to distinguish it from its southern counterpart, the Rock of Gibraltar.Fincal La Hometa website, accessed 20 March 2011
Behind Penyal d'Ifac is a large lagoon cut off from the sea by strips of sandy beach and extending inland to the coastal mountains.  The wetland area around the lagoon is all that remains of the formerly much more extensive wetlands of the Marina Alta.
A protracted campaign to protect the site's unique natural diversity led to the area being granted natural park status in January 1987. With an area of 45 hectares, it is the smallest natural park in Spain, possibly in Europe.  The park ranges from sea level to an altitude of 332 metres at the summit of the rock (penyal in Valencian, peñón in Castilian).
From the top of the rock there are views over the surrounding villages and countryside and on a clear day as far across the sea as Ibiza in the Balearic Islands.

Football Weekly is a podcast about football, hosted by The Guardian newspaper in the United Kingdom. Originally provided weekly (as its name suggests), its popularity led to a mid-weekly spinoff, Football Weekly Extra. Football Weekly airs on Mondays during the European football season, after the weekend's fixtures, while Football Weekly Extra airs on Thursdays.[tpl] cite news | title = James Richardson and his pod-mates return to preview the new Premier League season | url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/08/10/football_weekly_39.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=10 August 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] During the Euro 2008, World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012 tournaments, the podcast was provided daily.
It is presented by James Richardson, who is joined by various Guardian journalists and correspondents, most regularly Barry Glendenning, who is often mistakenly referred to as a co-host. Despite being an English production, the show takes a notably Eurocentric view of world football matters. Particular emphasis is placed on the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and the Bundesliga.
The show is noted for its irreverent, often iconoclastic, style and mood. Although it adheres to a traditional sports chat show format, the presenters are encouraged to digress on matters unrelated to football and to divulge marginal information from the industry normally withheld from print. As such, its level of discussion is often anecdotal, fragmentary and partial. This is in stark contrast to the normal procedures of professional sports journalism, and is a rarity among sports chat shows in general. Listener-generated jingles introducing presenters and knowingly bad sound effects were previously used but have been phased out.

Gare de Denfert-Rochereau is a railway station in Paris. It was one of the first stations of the French railway network, and is still in use as a station of Paris' RER line B.
Built from 1842 and opened on 7 June 1846, the station building had a circular shape as it possessed a rail loop. Indeed the station was the Parisian terminus of a line from Sceaux. This system, named "Arnoux" (after its inventor), was abandoned at the end of the 19th century as it required the construction of specific engines capable of travelling on very tight curves and broad gauge tracks of [tpl]RailGauge|1.75m[/tpl]. The line was extended to the Gare du Luxembourg in 1895, with the newly created Port-Royal station along the way. The line was operated by the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans until 1937 when the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer Métropolitain de Paris (CMP) (predecessor of the RATP) took over. It became line B of the RER in 1977 on being extended to meet line A at Châtelet - Les Halles.
The station building of Denfert-Rochereau station is the oldest railway building still standing in Paris.
Denfert-Rochereau remains a station of line B of the réseau express régional and is an interchange with the métro station of the same name, Station Denfert-Rochereau.

From the nearby summit of Shutlingsloe (altitude 506 metres), which lies just to the north-west of the village, a wide panorama of the Cheshire Plain and the Peak District can be obtained. In clear conditions the view extends as far as the Mersey Estuary and the Welsh Clwydian Hills 40 miles to the west, and the cooling towers of the power stations on the banks of the River Trent 50 miles to the east.

He also worked as an economics teacher and started his own company, a search and selection agency. After his graduation in 1994, he was employed by ABN Amro as an investment manager, responsible for the financing of innovative companies in transition, e.g. start ups, expansion and management buy outs.
In 1998, he became a member of parliament for the Christian Democrats (CDA). As an MP he focused on public finances, small businesses and immigration politics. He was also one of the few CDA MPs that voted in favour of a law making same-sex marriages legal in the Netherlands.[tpl]nl icon[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Interview Joop Wijn|url=http://www.vrijnederland.nl/vn/show/id=63719|publisher=Vrij Nederland|date=2003-01-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Joop Wijn, een empathische streber|url=http://www.intermediair.nl/artikel.jsp?id=669624|publisher=Intermediair|date=2007-01-30[/tpl] The debate about same-sex marriage caused friction between his personal life and his political affiliation, as Wijn himself is gay.

Les XX was a group of twenty Belgian painters, designers and sculptors, formed in 1883 by the Brussels lawyer, publisher, and entrepreneur Octave Maus. For ten years "Les Vingt" (pronounced [tpl]IPA-fr|lɛ vɛ̃[/tpl]), as they called themselves, held an annual exhibition of their art; each year twenty international artists were also invited to participate in the exhibition. Artists invited over the years included Camille Pissarro (1887, 1889, 1891), Claude Monet (1886, 1889), Georges Seurat (1887, 1889, 1891, 1892), Paul Gauguin (1889, 1891), Paul Cézanne (1890), and Vincent van Gogh (1890, 1891).
Les XX was in some ways a successor to the group L'Essor. The rejection of Ensor's The Oyster Eater in 1883 by L'Essor Salon, following the earlier rejection by the Antwerp Salon, was one of the events that led to the formation of Les XX.
In 1893, the society of Les XX was transformed into "La Libre Esthétique".

[[ARP Quadra]]

CATEGORIES: ARP synthesizers

Introduced in 1979 the 61 key ARP Quadra is an analog musical synthesizer that was produced by ARP Instruments, Inc. from 1978 to 1981 in a failed attempt to catch up to the "lead" taken by Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 with its fully programmable memory.  Moog made a similar attempt with the Polymoog. The machine combined pre-existing products: the Omni, Odyssey, a Solina-esque string unit, a phase shifter and a divide-down organ with ADSR, and a 4075 24 db low pass filter into one box. It has four sections. Bass is on the bottom two octaves, has two unison bass circuits (electric and string), with AR and a single pole low pass filter and a related AD envelope for cutoff.  A string section is similar to the ARP Omni.  Poly Synth, and a two voice Lead Synth similar to the Odyssey and a five way mixer with four unit outputs, a stereo pair, a line mono and an XLR out.  
There are 16 memory locations, but these do not provide storage of slider settings. The 8048 microcomputer and 128k of CMOS SRAM memory recalls 16 stored sets of on/off decisions about which waveforms and modulations are turned on in each of the four sections, and lead intervals. Using LEDs the player is visually directed to the sliders critical to the sound selected but their settings are not updated.  This necessary tweaking and fine tuning is the weakness of the Quadra. 
Like the Moog Polymoog keyboard, the Quadra was not a truly polyphonic. It used divided-down circuits for the Omni-style string section, including ADSR, LFO, filter and VCAs for the Polyphonic Synth section. Both Polyphonic Synth and string sections share the hollow wave button which changes waveforms for both sections.  
It has a simple and useful arpeggiator for the lead section and memorizes intervals between the two lead VCOs.  Vibrato, LFO and a fast square wave trill can be added to the arpeggiation.  Very unusual is the two independent portamento rates for each VCO, whether locked together or in interval mode.  This is useful in either multiple or single trigger mode. 
Outstanding is the rich lush phase shifter which creates stereo and includes harmonic resonance.  Also uncommon is the ability to deploy sample and hold within the phaser.  The sound is similar to the chorus of the Solina, though many users avow that the Quadra due to its sonic texture and modulation controls is the richest string machine ever made. 
The top three octaves of the keyboard have a mechanical touch sensor that can either pitch bend or impact brilliance and filter.  Unique is the flat pedal feature which allows pedaling to dip individual notes and chords a semitone below so they rise to pitch with the envelope’s attack.  
Extensive CV/Gate facilities allow two external sequencers to independently control both the bass and the lead. It is capable of four independent outs, stereo out, mono, and mono XLR but hidden in the quad outs is TRS facility for processing and returning effects on individual parts of the four sections to be recombined with external audio at a built-in mixer, which includes an internal compressor circuit.  Like all ARP synthesizers of this series (2800) its true character opens up with selective use of the optional foot pedals.  
The Quadra uses the typical ARP orange and black color scheme of the company's later years including the orange leather end pieces and the clean XLR out for DI console recording.

The trunk is erect, up to 4 m tall and may branch near the base. Fronds are bi- or tripinnate and 1-1.5 m long. The stipe is warty, especially where scales have fallen. The scales are pale and have a distinctive dark glossy central region, with a paler dull margin. Sori are round and occur near the fertile pinnule midvein. They are covered by firm, dark indusia that are cup-like in appearance.
C. costalisora should not be confused with the similarly named Cyathea costulisora.

[[Architectural educator]]
CATEGORIES: Architectural education, Architecture educators

An architectural educator is one who educates ("draws out") others about architecture; the latter being the broad subject of the design of constructed environments.  Architectural Education has both public architectural education and professional architectural education stakeholder groups. The career of an architectural educator usually develops from a career in architecture or developed interest and practise in architecture and/or education about architecture.
Educating people about architecture as a system of placing things in the world, which was once considered an elite or sacred form of "knowledge".  Architecture was "archaically" defined in Western history, for example, by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (Rome c. 40 BC) as a culturally "higher order".  Yet in writing De Re Architectura Libri Decem (On Architecture, in Ten Books), Vitruvius also formalised written Western architectural education.  Many other cultures have aural and tactile non-textual architectural education traditions.  Contemporary education about the order and placement of things can equally be regarded as a hermeneutic (in Schleiermacher's sense): as developing citizens' understanding about the ecological significance of arrangements of people and things in particular human environments.
Architectural educators may work in the service of the architectural profession or in the wider community. In the architectural profession, architectural education in many countries is guided or regulated by validation or accreditation. In the community, architectural educators may work to aid citizens or members of a community to become aware of their environment, and their role in its ownership and custodianship.
Architectural Educators are represented by national and regional associations such ACSA in the USA http://www.acsa-arch.org and the EAAE http://www.eaae.be/ in Europe.
In some cases, architecture itself may become a tool of education, as traditionally practised by architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier, or as an educational heurism, as in the case of the work of a lesser known figure such as Anupama Kundoo (see below)
Some architectural educators are:

[[Banavie]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Lochaber

Banavie (Scottish Gaelic: Banbhaidh or Bainbhidh) is a small settlement near Fort William in the Highland Council Area of Scotland. One of the closest villages to Ben Nevis, it is about [tpl]convert|4|km|mi|disp=flip[/tpl] north east of Fort William town centre, next to Caol and Corpach.
It has been suggested that Banavie is one of the possible birth places of Saint Patrick. One theory is that Patrick was the son of a Roman tax collector and born at Banavie around AD 389. His family had come with the Romans who had invaded the West Highlands and Islands. The 19th century work 'History of Celtic Placenames' by William J. Watson notes: "St Patrick was born at Banna-venta, an early town south of the Grampians."William J Watson. The History of Celtic Place-Names of Scotland (1926)Philip Schaff. History of the Christian Church, Volume IV (1997) A similar placename, Bannavem Taburniae, is mentioned in one of the only two known authenticated letters by St Patrick.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/patrick/confession.ii.html|title=The Confessio of Saint Patrick[/tpl]
It was formerly where the Camanachd Association, the ruling body of shinty was based, but this has now been moved to Inverness.
Banavie railway station is on the highly scenic West Highland Line. The signalling centre at the station uses radio communications to control train movements on the West Highland Line. It covers a big area from Fort Wiiliam to Mallaig and from Fort William to Helensburgh including the branch line to Oban.
The Caledonian Canal passes through Banavie, before ascending Neptune's Staircase, the longest staircase lock in the United Kingdom. The canal is crossed by two swing bridges, one carrying the railway and the other the A835 road.
The village has a number of bed and breakfast, guesthouses, self-catering and hotels.
The scenery around Banavie is exceptional with Ben Nevis dominant in the skyline. The Caledonian Canal passes through the village at Neptune's Staircase, which is a set of lock gates that raise vessels into Banavie upper canal area which has a long pontoon for visiting boats and yachts.
The Great Glen Way long distance path also passes through the village, mostly following the canal tow-path  to Gairlochy.

Clyde Edgerton (born  May 20, 1944) is an American author and Creative Writing professor.
Born in Durham, North Carolina, his books are known for endearing characters, small-town Southern dialogue and realistic fire and brimstone religious sermons.  His books are full of humor, while still respecting the characters' integrity.
He grew up in the small, rural town of Bethesda, North Carolina.  He was the only child of Truma and Ernest Edgerton, who came from families of cotton and tobacco farmers, respectively.
In 1962 Edgerton enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, eventually majoring in English.  During this time he was a student in the Air Force ROTC program where he learned to fly a small plane.  After graduating in 1966, he entered the Air Force and served five years as a fighter pilot in the United States, Korea, Japan and Thailand.
After his time in service, Edgerton got his Master's degree in English and began a job as an English teacher at his old high school.  Soon after, he also earned a doctorate.
He decided to become a writer in 1978 after watching Eudora Welty read a short story on public television.
Publication of Edgerton's first novel, Raney, the plot of which revolves around the marriage of a Free Will Baptist and an Episcopalian, ultimately led to Edgerton's leaving the teaching staff at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina (a Baptist institution).  His later work, Killer Diller, is a thinly-veiled satire of that university and its administration, with whom Edgerton clashed over Raney.
All of Edgerton’s works are influenced in some way by his personal experiences.  While much of his prose feels like reading a slice-of-life narrative, there is one text that is less Edgerton, and more “life” – his novel Redeye.   Inspired by a visit to the Mesa Verde and Anasazi cliff dwellings, Clyde Edgerton uses that as a central location for the events of his story.  The text is set in 1890s Colorado, and required an extensive amount of research when compared to his other works.
Currently he is a professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.
He has a street named after him in Kernersville, North Carolina.

[[Naming conventions for destroyers of the Royal Navy]]
CATEGORIES: Destroyers of the Royal Navy, Ship naming conventions

The first Torpedo Boat Destroyer (TBD) in the Royal Navy was HMS Havock of 1893. From 1906, the term "Torpedo Boat Destroyer" began to appear in the shortened form "Destroyer" when referring to Destroyer Flotillas. There is no official Admiralty order pertaining to the change and the abbreviated term "TBD" is present in the Navy List up to 1919, even though Destroyer was the term used in most official orders from 1917. 
Up to 1913, names were allocated under no fixed system, leading to a heterogeneous array, although 2 groups were named systematically; after rivers and tribes (later the E and F classes, respectively). In 1913, with burgeoning numbers of TBDs, the Admiralty took the confusing situation in hand; Havock and her similar "27 knotter" sisters with 2 shafts were grouped as the A class, and similar groups of "30 knotter" TBDs were grouped as the B class (4 funneled ships), C class (3 funnels) and D class (2 funnels). Later classes of ships were grouped as the E to K classes, although there was no J class. These are ships that the observer would recognise as being the fore-runners of the modern destroyer, with the turtle back and low conning tower replaced by a forecastle and wheelhouse with a compass platform above. 
The last class of ships built with mixed names were the Acasta or K class of the 1911 - 1912 program. From the L class of the 1912 - 1913 programme onwards, ships took the initial letter of their name from the class letter, although large classes such as the M, R and S were allocated more than one initial letter. Flotilla Leaders were generally named after famed historical (and generally, naval) characters and vessels building for other countries that had been commandeered for the Royal Navy were not allocated into the letter system (e.g. ex-Turkish ships received "T" names and ex-Greek ships "M" names with a Greek mythology theme).
Post war, flotillas were ordered as eight ships and a separate leader (later 7 ships and a leader, later 8 ships and no specialised leader). Each class was allocated an initial letter from which names were taken, and leaders were again often named after historical figures. These ships, up to the I class, are known as the "interwar standard". Again, vessels appropriated from other nations were not allocated into the class letter system, but took letter names of similar Royal Navy designs. The programme of 1936 produced sufficiently novel ships to warrant a change in convention; "tribal" names again being applied, although subsequent ships returned to the letter system. The O through Z classes were ordered under the War Emergency Programme. Having exhausted the alphabet, the next emergency flotillas returned to the next unused letter start of the alphabet. This was C, the C class of 1930 having been completely transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy. As 5 flotillas were ordered, groups of 2 initial letters were used; Ca-, Ch-, Co-, Cr- and Ce-, although the latter flotilla were later cancelled.
The proposed G class of 1943 were the penultimate ships to be allocated letter names, after this systematic themes for names were adopted; Battles, Weapons, Counties and Towns. The exception was the Daring class of 1949 with names beginning with D. Since the County class of 1959, type numbers have also been allocated to destroyers. The Type 45 destroyers, the Royal Navy’s latest vessels of this type, have resurrected the letter naming convention, taking D names repeating those of the previous Daring class.

CATEGORIES: Birds of prey, Perninae, Birds of Cuba, West Indian restricted-range endemic bird species

The Cuban Kite (Chondrohierax wilsonii) is a  bird of prey in the family Accipitridae which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, eagles and harriers. It is endemic to Cuba.
This species is classified as critically endangered by BirdLife International. The current population is estimated 50 to 249 mature birds. After a last confirmed sighting in 2001 and an unconfirmed sighting in 2004 Cuban ornithologist Nils Navarro Pacheco took a photograph of one individual in 2009.
The Clements Checklist and the AOU consider it as subspecies of the Hook-billed Kite. A molecular phylogenetics analysis using mitochondrial DNA suggests that it warrants species status having diverged from the mainland lineage approximately 400,000 to 1.5 million years ago.

Cyathea crassa is a species of tree fern endemic to the Santo Domingo area in the Dominican Republic. Little is known about this rare tree fern.
C. crassa is part of the Cyathea woodwardioides complex from the Greater Antilles together with five other species: Cyathea fulgens, Cyathea grevilleana, Cyathea portoricensis, and Cyathea tussacii.
This species is not conspecific with Alsophila crassa (Karsten, 1869), which is based on material collected from wet, cold, montane forest at Mérida by Franz Engel in 1859. There are no modern collections that match Karsten's description and so the identity of this species remains unclear.
The naming of C. crassa represents some taxonomic problems. If the genus Alsophila is recognised, the specific epithet crassa is unavailable for this tree fern, having been used by Karsten. To avoid confusion, David Conant renamed it Alsophila jimeneziana in 1983.

[[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]]
CATEGORIES: Political parties of the Fifth Republic

The Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left (Fédération de la gauche démocrate et socialiste or FGDS) was a conglomerate of French left-wing non-Communist forces. It was founded to support François Mitterrand's candidature at the 1965 presidential election and to counterbalance the Communist preponderance over the French left. It was composed of:
Before the beginning of the 1965 presidential campaign, the non-Communist left was divided. The Socialist Gaston Defferre proposed the creation of a "Great Federation" gathering the center-left and the center-right parties in order to resist to the Gaullist domination over the country and to the leading role of the French Communist Party (PCF) over the opposition. He wanted to be its candidate for the presidency. However, this project failed in due to the objections of the Socialist and Christian-Democrat leaders.
Then, François Mitterrand proposed to be candidate with a strategy of union between the left-wing forces, including the PCF. This one accepted to support his candidature. Nevertheless, in order to talk on an equal footing with the Communists, he advocated the constitution of a federation of the left-wing non-Communist forces. This strategy was confirmed by the relatively good electoral result of Mitterrand, who succeeded to prevent a re-election of De Gaulle in the first round, and obtained 45% of the votes against him in the second round. Furthermore, the PCF/FGDS electoral agreements permitted to shrink the Gaullist parliamentary majority after the 1967 legislative election. But the FGDS was divided about question of the relations with the PCF which demanded the elaboration of a common programme.
During the May 68 events, François Mitterrand announced his candidature for an anticipated presidential election. He thought Charles de Gaulle would resign after the crisis. Finally, de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and his followers won the June 1968 legislative election. Held as responsible for the failure, Mitterrand resigned in November 1968 and the FGDS dissolved itself. Mitterrand then undertook to conquer the Socialist Party (PS) which succeeded to the SFIO in 1969.

However, the dye does not exist, and although a chemical could be manufactured to react to urine, it would be difficult to prevent it from reacting to other substances present in pool water.
A few companies capitalized on the urban legend by creating professional pool signs that warned that the pool was indeed being monitored with the chemical called "wee alert" or a similar catchy name.  The signs were a strong deterrent particularly for adults.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]

[[Alternative media in South Africa]]
CATEGORIES: South African media, Alternative media

South Africa has a long history of alternative media. During the eighties there was a host of community and grassroots newspapers that supplied content that ran counter to the prevailing attitudes of the times. In addition, a thriving small press and underground press carried voices that would not have been heard in the mainstream, corporate media. Pirate radio projects operated by Caset were the forerunners of the country's community radio and small pamphlets and samizdat were included in the mix.
The advocacy journalism of early activist titles were in stark contrast to the complacency of the country's large media houses.While many of the counterculture titles associated with the apartheid struggle no longer exist, there has been a resurgence of alternative media and the small press after a period of decline, notable for the fact that large corporates absorbed many of the so-called "struggle" journalists and mopped-up small publishing houses. These media projects involve multi-media as well as electronic journalism. Only time can tell whether or not, today's alternative media will regain some of the glory of the past.
However, there are many who criticise what they call a lack of real alternative media in South Africa.[tpl]cite web|title=What’s wrong with the alternative media in South Africa?|url=http://www.killingtrain.com/node/429| publisher=The Killing Train|date =2005-07-11[/tpl]

[[Borage seed oil]]
CATEGORIES: Vegetable oils

Borage seed oil is derived from the seeds of the Borago officinalis (borage).Borage at Sloan-Kettering website
Borage seed oil has one of the highest amounts of γ-linolenic acid (GLA) of seed oils — higher than blackcurrant seed oil or evening primrose oil, to which it is considered similar. GLA comprises around 24% of the oil typically. GLA is converted to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, a precursor to a variety of the 1-series prostaglandins and the 3-series leukotrienes. It inhibits leukotriene synthesis to provide therapy in rheumatologic illness. Borage seed oil may therefore have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects and it has been studied for its potential to treat anti-inflammatory disorders, arthritis, atopic eczema, and respiratory inflammation.  However, several clinical studies have shown it to be ineffective at treating atopic eczema.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 10233322 | year = 1999 | last1 = Henz | first1 = BM | last2 = Jablonska | first2 = S | last3 = Van De Kerkhof | first3 = PC | last4 = Stingl | first4 = G | last5 = Blaszczyk | first5 = M | last6 = Vandervalk | first6 = PG | last7 = Veenhuizen | first7 = R | last8 = Muggli | first8 = R | last9 = Raederstorff | first9 = D | title = Double-blind, multicentre analysis of the efficacy of borage oil in patients with atopic eczema | volume = 140 | issue = 4 | pages = 685–8 | journal = The British journal of dermatology| display-authors = 9 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.1999.02771.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid =    14670885 | year =    2003 | last1 =    Takwale | first1 =    A | last2 =    Tan | first2 =    E | last3 =    Agarwal | first3 =    S | last4 =    Barclay | first4 =    G | last5 =    Ahmed | first5 =    I | last6 =    Hotchkiss | first6 =    K | last7 =    Thompson | first7 =    JR | last8 =    Chapman | first8 =    T | last9 =    Berth-Jones | first9 =    J | title =    Efficacy and tolerability of borage oil in adults and children with atopic eczema: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group trial | volume =    327 | issue =    7428 | pages =    1385 | doi =    10.1136/bmj.327.7428.1385 | pmc =    292992 | journal =    BMJ (Clinical research ed.)| display-authors =    9 [/tpl]

The Summit County Rumble were a Continental Indoor Football League team located in Tallmadge, Ohio (near Akron) and that began play in 2007. The team played their home games at the Summit County Fairgrounds Arena Complex. The team was originally scheduled to play as the Toledo Rumble in the Toledo Sports Arena, but the city of Toledo, which is seeking a new arena, balked on the deal. Later on, they were going to play as the Wayne County Rumble at the Alice Noble Ice Arena in Wooster, Ohio, but a deal fell through.All-Star games just aren't the same, the-daily-record.com, February 18, 2007 Finally, they were going to play at the Gault Recreation and Fitness Center, also in Wooster, but a deal fell through there as well.  With that they decided to move to Summit County and became the Summit County Rumble.waynecorumble.com (site no longer in operation)
The team held the dubious distinction of being the first team to lose to the New York/New Jersey Revolution (a 48-47 loss on May 5, 2007 at the Rumble's home opener).  Later in the season, on June 16, the Rumble defeated the Revolution in Morristown by a score of 38-27, thus earning the Rumble their first (and only) win in franchise history.

[[Homeridae]]
CATEGORIES: Oral epic poets, Homer, Ancient Chios

The Homeridae were a family, clan or professional lineage on the island of ChiosMoses I. Finley, The World Of Odysseus, rev, ed, 1976:39. claiming descent from the legendary Greek epic poet Homer.
The origin of the name seems obvious: in classical Greek the word should mean "children of Homer". An analogous name, Asclepiadae, identified a clan or guild of medical practitioners as "children of Asclepius". However, since the existence of the Homeridae is authenticated while that of Homer is not, and since Greek homeros is a common noun meaning "hostage", it was suggested even in ancient times that the Homeridae were in reality "children (or descendants) of hostages". The natural further step is to argue that Homer, the supposed founder, is a mythical figure, a mere back-formation, deriving his name from that of the later guild.
Their influence on the dark early history of transmission of the Homeric texts, though incalculable, is sure to have been conservative.Finley 1976.
Evidence on the Homeridae relates to the late sixth, fifth and fourth centuries BC, after which nothing more is heard of them.
The first contemporary mention of this group is in a poem of about 485 BC by Pindar:
 In the same way as the Homeridae, 
 Singers of stitched words, usually 
Begin with an address to Zeus ... 
Pindar, Nemean Odes 2.1-3.
A "singer of stitched words" is a literal definition of a rhapsode. 
Later contemporary references come in fourth-century texts, in the works of Plato and Isocrates. In one of his essays, written around 350 BC, Isocrates says:
 Some of the Homeridae tell the story that Helen appeared to Homer in a dream and told him to make a poem about the Trojan expedition.Isocrates, Praise of Helen 28.  
At a slightly earlier date Plato makes a similar comment:
 I believe that some of the Homeridae recite two hymns to Eros from among the esoteric poems. One of them is quite disrespectful to the god, and, what's more, the metre is incorrect! This is what they sing: 
There are two further mentions, in Plato's Republic and in the Ion. In the latter the rhapsode Ion claims that he should be "crowned by the Homeridae" for his work in promoting the poems of Homer.Plato, Republic 599d; Ion 530d. It is usual in a work on Plato to translate Homeridae as "admirers of Homer", but there is nothing to support this interpretation [tpl]Harv|Dalby|2006|p=170[/tpl].
Supplementary information, of uncertain validity, is found in later Greek antiquarian writings. A scholarly commentary on Pindar's poem gives the following details:
The name Homeridae originally meant descendants of Homer, who maintained the tradition of singing his poems, but afterwards was applied to rhapsodes who did not claim literal descent from him. One famous member, Cynaethus of Chios, was at the centre of a group who were specially active in composing new poems and attaching them to Homer's works. Cynaethus himself was the author of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo and was the first to perform Homeric poems at Syracuse.Scholia on Pindar, Nemean Odes 2.1. 
A second source is Harpocration, who names three early writers of Greek local history whose works are now lost: Acusilaus and Hellanicus of Lesbos apparently stated that the Homeridae were named after Homer, while Seleucus said that they were not.Harpocration, Lexicon s.v. Homeridae. Finally, the geographer Strabo says that the people of Chios adduced the Homeridae as evidence that Homer came from Chios; which implies, though Strabo does not say it, that the Homeridae, too, came from Chios.Strabo, Geography 14.1.35.
It seems from this evidence that the Homeridae were a guild of oral performers (rhapsodes, as implied by Pindar's phrase "singers of stitched words") who claimed to inherit Homer's tradition and performed poems ascribed to Homer, no doubt including the Iliad and Odyssey. They also developed stories about how the poems had originated, such as Homer's dream of Helen. Like other rhapsodes, they travelled widely, but they were perhaps based on Chios. Certain Homeridae were active in adding new poems to the tradition. 
Incidentally, some people believed these attributions: Thucydides, though not easily fooled, quotes from a version of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo similar to the text now known and confidently ascribes it to Homer.Thucydides, Histories 3.104.

Stakeholder analysis in conflict resolution, project management, and business administration, is the process of identifying the individuals or groups that are likely to affect or be affected by a proposed action, and sorting them according to their impact on the action and the impact the action will have on them. This information is used to assess how the interests of those stakeholders should be addressed in a project plan, policy, program, or other action. Stakeholder analysis is a key part of stakeholder management. A stakeholder analysis of an issue consists of weighing and balancing all of the competing demands on a firm by each of those who have a claim on it, in order to arrive at the firm's obligation in a particular case. A stakeholder analysis does not preclude the interests of the stakeholders overriding the interests of the other stakeholders affected, but it ensures that all affected will be considered.[tpl]cite book|last=DeGeorge|first=Richard T.|title=Author|date=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=7th Upper Saddle River|page=192[/tpl]

Liu Hailong (Chinese: 柳海龙, pinyin: Liǔ Hǎilóng, born May 30, 1981 in Shandong Province) is a Chinese Sanshou kickboxer. Liu's rise to fame came in 2000 in the inaugural King of Sanda tournament. Liu not only won his weight class, but went on to win a grueling one-night open weight round robin tournament against much bigger fighters as well,  giving him the title Sanda "King of Kings". Exciting and charismatic, Liu is almost certainly China's most recognized combat athlete.
In 2003, Liu faced a fellow King of Sanda in Yuan Yubao in the promotion's first "superfight", defeating him soundly by decision to earn the title of "Super King of Sanda".
At the Sanshou World Championships in Macau, Liu faced Muslim Salihov in amateur rules competition and beat him on points to win the 80 kg division gold medal. Salihov is a highly accomplished Russian Sanshou fighter who would later become a King of Sanda himself. Some fight observers believe Salihov won the closely contested match.[tpl]cite news|title= Kungfu goes international|work= China Daily|date=|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2002/0801/sp30-1.html|accessdate=2010-03-10[/tpl]
In December 2003, Liu scored a unanimous decision over Eduardo Fujihara to claim the IKF Sanshou World Championship. Other Chinese fighters who participated in that event include Bao Li Gao.
At the World Sanda Kings tournament in 2003 there was a challenge issued by well-known American Sanshou fighter Cung Le to Liu Hailong for a ``superfight`` to decide who was the best in the world. However the highly anticipated matchup never materialized between the two sides.
After an injury in 2005, Liu retired from the sport. In 2009, he made a comeback facing and KOing Japanese fighter Iga Koji.[tpl]cite news|title= Liu Hailong|work= Sohu Sports |date=|url=http://data.sports.sohu.com/person/person.php?id=3021|accessdate=2012-04-13[/tpl]

[[Crumb Duck]]

CATEGORIES: Nurse with Wound albums, 1993 EPs, Collaborative albums, Stereolab EPs

Crumb Duck is the first collaboration between prolific Anglo-French indie band Stereolab and cult avant-garde unit Nurse With Wound, first released on 10" vinyl on the Clawfist label in 1993.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.stereolab.co.uk/discography/?no=11 | publisher=Stereolab | work=Stereolab Official Site | title=crumb duck | accessdate=5 May 2007[/tpl]
Stereolab guitarist Tim Gane detailed the circumstances surrounding this collaboration to The Wire in 1997 (issue 164) whilst undertaking the magazine's "Invisible Jukebox" feature (alongside Lætitia Sadier). Gane stated that he had invited sole permanent NWW member Steven Stapleton to produce Stereolab's debut album (later released as Peng!). However, Gane stated that Stapleton had refused on the grounds that the group were "too rock" but had agreed to undertake a remix for the group instead. Stapleton surprised Gane by producing a letter he had written to NWW some years previously, which he had marked as the 15th piece of correspondence he had received regarding his group (also The Wire, issue 164). According to a newsletter issued by Stereolab's Duophonic Records, part of the agreement was that Stereolab would not get to hear the finished results until after the record had been pressed and released.[tpl]cite news | publisher=The Wire | author=Mike Barnes | title=Invisible Jukebox | pages=38 |date=October 1997[/tpl]
"Exploding Head Movie" is a Stapleton remix of a section of the 18-minute album version of the "Jenny Ondioline" single (as heard on Transient Random Noise Bursts with Announcements). "Animal or Vegetable (A Wonderful Wooden Reason ......)" saw Stapleton playing the vocal track in reverse and adding several layers of wild distorted guitar to the lengthy middle section before applying his familiar tape collage methods to the coda. The original version of this track has not been released. An homage to the German group Faust is provided by the subtitle to "Animal or Vegetable" – "A Wonderful Wooden Reason." The latter references a line from the lyrics of "Meadow Meal," a track on Faust's first album self-titled Faust (1971). Stapleton provided the distinctive cover image but around 30 copies came with sleeves hand drawn by members of Stereolab.[tpl]cite web | url=http://brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/cf20.php?site=nww | publisher=Nurse With Wound | work=NWW Official Site | title=Crumb Duck | accessdate=5 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.faust-pages.com/records/clear.html | publisher=The Faust Pages | work=Records | title=1971: Faust: Clear | accessdate=7 May 2007[/tpl]
Stereolab later included both tracks on their Refried Ectoplasm compilation which remains in print. NWW, for their part, issued a Crumb Duck CD, adding 2 tracks from a 7" single NWW had previously issued on the Clawfist label and an outtake. A vinyl edition of this expanded reissue was also made available but both formats went out of print when NWW's distributor, World Serpent Distribution, went out of business.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=2840_0_2_0_C | publisher=Side Line | title=World Serpent to stop | date=23 August 2004 | accessdate=8 May 2007[/tpl] NWW also included "Animal Or Vegetable" on their The Swinging Reflective compilation.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.stereolab.co.uk/discography/?no=75 | publisher=Stereolab | work=Stereolab Official Site | title=refried ectoplasm | accessdate=7 May 2007[/tpl]

Ashtown Castle (Irish Caisleán Bhaile an Ásaighis) a fortified house in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. 
It was found hidden within the walls of a much larger and more recent building that was being used by the Papal Nuncio until 1978. At that time, the more recent and larger building was deemed structurally irreparable due to dry rot. But as that was being demolished, Ashtown castle was discovered. It has now been restored and forms part of the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre.
It is thought to originally date from the 1430s[tpl]Verify source|date=August 2013[/tpl], as it is built to dimensions that conform with a government policy of the time who offered £10 to those who built a castle for their own safety. The castle was later incorporated into the construction of Ashtown Lodge which was to serve as the official residence of the Under Secretary from 1782.
The grounds in which Ashtown Castle is located has held a number of concerts in the past few years.

SeAZ (Serpukhovsky Avtomobilny Zavod) is a large engineering plant in Serpukhov, Russia. The company was founded on July 7, 1939 by order of the People's Commissar of General Engineering Industry and by the head of Glavmotoveloprom, concerning production of small capacity motorcycles. During 1939 to 1995 the company produced various microcars, usually powered by IZH motorcycle engines. Since the early 1980s it has produced Lada Oka microcars.
From the beginning of the 1980s the factory entered a period of development: the prototype of a new car was designed and produced, and was named "Oka". It anticipated the car produced nowadays.
In 1985 the USSR Council of Ministers issued a decree: "About the creation of new capacities for production of a new model of extra-small car at AvtoVAZ and KamAZ corporations and at Serpukhov Motor-car Factory, all belonging to the USSR Automotive Industry Ministry."
The Serpukhov factory was significantly rebuilt for the new tasks. The leading enterprises as well as foreign companies were entrusted with the equipment for production and assembling: Durr, Bollhoff and PPG. In 1989 the factory started assemblying first cars of the extra-small class. At the time the factory entered "AvtoVAZ" corporation.
In 1995 AvtoVAZ corporation fully transferred assembly of the Oka to "SMZ". The factory’s name was changed to "Serpukhov Motor-car Factory" ("Serpukhovsky Avtomobilny Zavod" – SeAZ).
In 2005 OAO "SeAZ" became a member of  the Avtokom industrial group.

[[HMS Swift (1907)]]

CATEGORIES: Destroyers of the Royal Navy, Mersey-built ships, 1907 ships, World War I destroyers of the United Kingdom

HMS ''Swift'' was a unique destroyer leader designed and built for the Royal Navy  prior to World War I, another product of Admiral "Jackie" Fisher's relentless quest for speed. The class was to be a of large ocean-going destroyer, capable of both the usual destroyer requirements and of the high-speed scouting duties for a major fleet.
Fisher put his specification to the Director of Naval Construction in October 1904 (320 feet, 900 tons, 36 knots). The DNC replied that it was not strong enough. In 1905 a revised design for 33.5 knots from 19,000 shp on a 1,400 t hull was pushed through followed by one for 36 knots on 1,350 tons from 29,000 shp.
Given only four weeks to produce their tender, the major shipyards - Cammell Laird, Thornycrofts, Fairfields, John Brown and Armstrong Whitworth - put forward designs. There were problems meeting the requirements and the high cost of the designs (for example, Armstrong's design was priced at £284,000, compared to £139,881 for [tpl]HMS|Afridi|1907|6[/tpl], a destroyer of the 1905 [tpl]sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer (1905)|4[/tpl]). A final design was not agreed until mid-December 1905; Cammell Laird only raking the order on their proviso that amendments would be needed. The vessel was 340ft, 1680 tons, armed with four Mark VIII 4 inch guns and two 18 inch torpedo tubes, and 30,000 shp oil-fired Parsons steam turbines with four shafts. The vessel was priced at £236,000 and given the building name Flying Scud (changed to Swift in April 1906). Work started in December 1906 and she was launched on December 7 1907.
In the initial contract the Admiralty included an offer of £18,000 for every knot more than 36 knots. In trials over a measured mile at Skelmorlie in March 1909 she suffered a number of mechanical failures and never managed better than 35.099 knots, at a shocking fuel consumption of 27.5 tons/hour out of a total stock of only 180 tons. Later trials, up to September 1909, used 26 different propeller designs in an attempt to reached the required speed. The Admiralty finally accepted her as she was for £236,764 with £44,240 in penalties for the failure to reach contracted speed and late delivery. After arguments from the builder as the difficulty of the task the penalties were reduced to £5,000. Reports to the press at the time claimed Swift could reach 38 knots.
Despite being the prototype for her class, no other leaders were built before the outbreak of war in 1914. Her weak armament, lack of speed, and high cost caused Arthur Wilson to note "I do not think we require any repetition of Swift in the immediate future."
At the beginning of the war as leader of the 4th Torpedo Boat Destroyer Flotilla she joined the Grand Fleet  The extreme weather of the northern winter seas was more than she could withstand and in 1915- after a short refit -she was reassigned to the Dover Patrol. In 1916 her two forward 4 inch guns were replaced with a single 6 inch gun (the only Royal Navy destroyer to ever carry a gun of that size). Her forward decks were reinforced to cope with the mass and recoil of the new gun and she also received additional bridge structures and two anti-aircraft guns.
On the night of April 20-21 1917, while commanded by Ambrose Peck and accompanying [tpl]HMS|Broke|1914|6[/tpl], she engaged a force of six enemy destroyers in the Battle of Dover Strait. In a confused fight she hit G85 with a torpedo while Broke rammed, and became enmeshed with, G42. The remaining German ships fled, Swift pursued but took several hits and was compelled to slow. She returned to assist Broke and rescue survivors of G42 before returning to Plymouth. Due to the poor performance of the 6 inch gun her armament was returned to two 4 inch guns.
In the spring of 1918 she was with the Offshore Squadron during the First Ostend Raid. Quietly sidelined and scrapped after the war, her size was not approached in the Royal Navy until the Tribal class of 1936.

Greek Rally (ES,[tpl]lang-el|Ελληνικός Συναγερμός[/tpl] ΕΣ, Ellinikos Synagermos ES) was a Greek right-wing political party founded on 6 August 1951 by former field marshal Alexandros Papagos. The party encompassed a broad spectrum of the royalist conservative right in Greek society and was modeled on the Charles de Gaulle's Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF).[tpl]Citation |first=Barbara |last=Jelavich |title=History of the Balkans: Twentieth Century |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983 |page=409[/tpl] The creation of the party reflected the interests of the United States, who believed it would help clean up the image of the Greek right and make it attractive to centrist voters. Throughout the years, the Greek right, represented by the People's Party, had become splintered. Papagos' new party managed to attract considerable support, and the Populist Uniting Party (led by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Stephanos Stephanopoulos) and the New Party (led by Spiros Markezinis) dissolved and merged with the Greek Rally. The popularity of Papagos, who had reinstated the autonomy of the Greek military during his tenure as its commander, enabled the party to quickly eclipse the Populists. In the September 1951 general election, the Greek Rally garnered 114 parliamentary seats (taking 36.5 per cent of the vote) compared to the People's Party two seats. In the subsequent November 1952 general election, the Greek Rally gained 240 out of 300 seats in the Greek Parliament, an achievement helped in no small way by a change in the electoral system. The party effectively ended with the death of its leader in October 1955. His successor, Konstantinos Karamanlis, relaunched the party as the National Radical Union.

It is celebrated by Egyptians as an annual holiday for two weeks starting August 15, known as Wafaa El-Nil. It is also celebrated in the Coptic Church by ceremonially throwing a martyr's relic into the river, hence the name, Esba` al-shahīd ('The Martyr's Finger'). Ancient Egyptians believed that the Nile flooded every year because of Isis's tears of sorrow for her dead husband, Osiris.

[[Truncatable prime]]

CATEGORIES: Base-dependent integer sequences, Classes of prime numbers

In number theory, a left-truncatable prime is a prime number which, in a given base, contains no 0, and if the leading ("left") digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime. For example 9137, since 9137, 137, 37 and 7 are all prime. Decimal representation is often assumed and always used in this article.
A right-truncatable prime is a prime which remains prime when the last ("right") digit is successively removed. For example 7393, since 7393, 739, 73, 7 are all prime.
There are exactly 4260 decimal left-truncatable primes:
The largest is the 24-digit 357686312646216567629137.
There are 83 right-truncatable primes. The complete list:
The largest is the 8-digit 73939133. All primes above 5 end with digit 1, 3, 7 or 9, so a right-truncatable prime can only contain those digits after the leading digit.
There are 15 primes which are both left-truncatable and right-truncatable. They have been called two-sided primes. The complete list:
A left-truncatable prime is called restricted if all of its left extensions are composite i.e. there is no other left-truncatable prime of which this prime is the left-truncated "tail". Thus 7939 is a restricted left-truncatable prime because the nine 5-digit numbers ending in 7939 are all composite, whereas 3797 is a left-truncatable prime that is not restricted because 33797 is also prime.
Excluding the trivial cases 2 and 5, there are 1440 restricted left-truncatable primes:
While the primality of a number does not depend on the numeral system used, truncatable primes are defined only in relation with a given base. A variation involves removing 2 or more decimal digits at a time. This is mathematically equivalent to using base 100 or a larger power of 10, with the restriction that base 10n digits must be at least 10n−1, in order to match a decimal n-digit number with no leading 0.
An author named Leslie E. Card in early volumes of the Journal of Recreational Mathematics (which started its run in 1968) considered a topic close to that of right-truncatable primes, calling sequences that by adding digits to the right in sequence to an initial number not necessarily prime snowball primes. 
Discussion of the topic dates to at least the November of 1969 issue of Mathematics Magazine, where truncatable primes were called prime primes by two co-authors (Murray Berg and John E. Walstrom).

John Marshall (27 July 1765 – 6 June 1845) was a British businessman and politician from Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.
Marshall was born at 1, Briggate, Leeds, the son of Jeremiah (1731–1787), a linen draper, and his wife Mary (1728–1799), whose father was John Cowper of Yeadon. He was their only child who survived infancy.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | last=Beresford | first=Maurice | title=Marshall, John (1765–1845) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | date=September 2004 | publisher=Oxford University Press | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37739 | accessdate=2008-07-17[/tpl] (online available to subscribers; also in print)
Marshall joined the family business when he was seventeen. Five years later his father died and Marshall became the controlling partner in the company. He inherited a new house, a warehouse, and £7,500. Shortly before his father's death, Marshall heard that two men from Darlington, John Kendrew, a glass-grinder, and Thomas Porthouse, a watchmaker, had registered a patent for a new flax spinning machine. Marshall visited the men and purchased the right to make copies of their invention. He spent much of the next decade trying to improve the performance of the machines but found little success until he recruited engineer Matthew Murray.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
In 1790, he bought the freehold of an acre of land on Water Lane in Holbeck near Leeds. This was an ideal location for a mill because of its proximity to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Aire and Calder Navigation. Here, between 1791 and 1792, he constructed Marshall's Mill, a six-storey water-powered mill using water drawn from the nearby Hol Beck to spin yarn. Marshall was able to create enough power to run 7,000 spindles employing 2,000 factory workers. Only a generation earlier, the making of hand-spun yarn had been a traditional Yorkshire cottage industry.
In 1796, he was a partner (with Thomas Benyon, Benjamin Benyon, and Charles Bage) in building a flax mill at Ditherington near Shrewsbury, which was the first iron framed building in the world.A. W. Skempton and H. R. Johnson, 'The First iron frames' Architectural Review (March 1962); repr. in R. J. M. Sutherland, Structural Iron 1750–1850 (Ashgate, Aldershot 1997), 25–36.
Adjacent to Marshall's Mill, he built his most ambitious project: Temple Works flax mill between 1836 and 1840. Temple Works was based on the Temple of Edfu at Horus in Egypt, with a chimney designed in the style of an obelisk; at the time, it was said to be the largest single room in the world. Employees at Temple Works worked 72 hours a week, 40% of the people employed by Marshall were young women aged thirteen to twenty, and about 20% were under thirteen. Conditions in the flax mills of that era were extremely hot and humid because of the number of workers and the fact that humid conditions made the flax easier to work. Despite the age of his workers and the conditions in his factories, Marshall is considered to be one of the most liberal factory owners of the industrial revolution[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]. In his factories, overseers were not allowed to use corporal punishment on the workers. Younger children were encouraged to attend day school, and older children were given free education on Monday afternoons.
Marshall was involved in the founding of the Leeds Mechanics' Institute and the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. In 1826, he began a campaign to establish Leeds University. Marshall also gave money to the Leeds Library.
In 1821 Marshall was appointed Sheriff of Cumberland [tpl]cite book| title = A genealogical and heraldic history of the commoners of Great Britain and Ireland|first = John|last = Burke|page =295|accessdate = 2012-03-25[/tpl] and in 1826 was elected a Member of Parliament for Yorkshire in the House of Commons.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/marshall-john-1765-1845| title = MARSHALL, John (1765-1845), of Headingley House, nr.

The house is currently used as the Ullswater Outward Bound Centre.http://www.outwardbound.org.uk/Individual/Venues/Ullswater.htm
Marshall married Jane Pollard, daughter of a William Pollard, a Halifax wool-stapler and linen-merchant.  Her three spinster sisters (Ann, Catharine and Eleanor) moved to a house named Old Church, near Hallsteads, by 1829.  Jane had met Dorothy Wordsworth while Dorothy was at school in Halifax, and there are references to visits to Hallsteads and Old Church in Dorothy and William Wordsworth's correspondence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oldchurch.co.uk/OCH/History.htm|title=The Old Church Hotel: History|accessdate=2008-07-17[/tpl]

[[List of Sinhala words of Tamil origin]]

CATEGORIES: Tamil language lists, Sri Lanka-related lists, Lists of Sinhala words of foreign origin

Sinhala words of Tamil origin came about as part of the more than 2000 years of language interactions between Sinhala and Tamil in the island of Sri Lanka. Sinhala is classified as an Indo-Aryan language and Tamil is classified as a Dravidian language. Separated from its sister Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi and Bengali by a large belt of Dravidian languages, Sinhala along with Dhivehi of the Maldives evolved somewhat separately. 
Close interaction with the Tamil language and the assimilation of Tamil immigrants from South India into Sinhalese society contributed to the adoption several Tamil origin words into the Sinhalese language. It is important to note that the range of borrowings goes beyond the scope to be expected for a situation where two neighbouring peoples exchange material goods: Firstly, there are many Tamil loanwords pertaining to everyday and social life (kinship terms, body parts, ordinary activities). Secondly, several lexical words (nouns, adjectives and verbs)  along with interjections (ayiyō), (aḍō) have also been borrowed. This - along with the impact Tamil has had on Sinhala syntax (e.g. the use of a verbal adjective of "to say" as a subordinating conjunction meaning "whether" and "that") - is suggestive of not only close coexistence but the existence of large numbers of bilinguals and a high degree of mixing and intermarriage.

In 1941 she made her debut at Kelly's Stable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/627011122.html?dids=627011122:627011122&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Aug+26%2C+1979&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=People&pqatl=google |title=People |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1979-08-26 |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl]
In 1948, performing at the Cinderella Club in Greenwich Village, she was seen by Mae West, who gave her a part in a show she was doing.  Among others who observed her in nightclubs was Frank Sinatra who considered her the "world's greatest saloon singer." Sinatra subsequently conducted her 1982 album, Syms by Sinatra.
She was signed to a recording contract by Decca Records, having her major success with a recording of "I Could Have Danced All Night" in 1956, which sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. Syms made regular appearances at the Carlyle in Manhattan. At times, impromptu, while enjoying a cocktail in the bar of the Carlyle, she would walk on stage and perform with the cabaret's other regular, Bobby Short.
Sylvia Syms had a lung removed circa 1972 despite which she shortly thereafter performed as Bloody Mary in South Pacific for several months at the Chateau de Ville Dinner Theater - a performance that was well received by reviewers and audiences alike.
She died on stage at the Algonquin Hotel in New York from a heart attack, aged 74.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1992_1054661/world-s-greatest-saloon-singer-dies-sylvia-syms-73.html |title=| Archives | Chron.com - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jamesgavin.com/page47/page57/page57.html |title=Sylvia Syms |publisher=Jamesgavin.com |date=1992-05-17 |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl]

Nomads are known as a group of communities who travel from place to place for their livelihood. Some are salt traders, fortune-tellers, conjurers, ayurvedic healers, jugglers, acrobatss, story tellers, snake charmers, animal doctors, tattooists, grindstone makers, or basketmakers.  All told, anthropologists have identified about 500 nomadic groups in India, numbering perhaps 80 million people—around 7 percent of the country's billion-plus population.Nomads in India : proceedings of the National Seminar / edited by P.K. Misra, K.C. Malhotra
The nomadic communities in India can be broadly divided into three groups hunter gatherers, pastoralists and the peripatetic or non-food producing groups. Among these, peripatetic nomads are the most neglected and discriminated social group in India.Customary strangers : new perspectives on peripatetic peoples in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia / edited by Joseph C. Berland and Aparna Rao They have lost their livelihood niche because of drastic changes in transport, industries, production, entertainment and distribution systems.
Though very poor and deprived they are still not facilitated with any constitutional safeguard and concern.  Statistics show that governments are applying development policies which are basically invented for scheduled tribes or scheduled casts. The government of India in early 2006 has set up a commission for the development of these communities.

[[Decorrelation]]
CATEGORIES: Signal processing, Image processing, Computational physics

Decorrelation is a general term for any process that is used to reduce autocorrelation within a signal, or cross-correlation within a set of signals, while preserving other aspects of the signal. A frequently used method of decorrelation is the use of a matched linear filter to reduce the autocorrelation of a signal as far as possible. Since the minimum possible autocorrelation for a given signal energy is achieved by equalising the power spectrum of the signal to be similar to that of a  white noise signal, this is often referred to as signal whitening. 
Although most decorrelation algorithms are linear, non-linear decorrelation algorithms also exist.
Many data compression algorithms incorporate a decorrelation stage. For example, many transform coders first apply a fixed linear transformation that would, on average, have the effect of decorrelating a typical signal of the class to be coded, prior to any later processing. This is typically a Karhunen-Loève transform, or a simplified approximation such as the discrete cosine transform. 
By comparison, sub-band coders do not generally have an explicit decorrelation step, but instead exploit the already-existing reduced correlation within each of the sub-bands of the signal, due to the relative flatness of each sub-band of the power spectrum in many classes of signals.
Linear predictive coders can be modeled as an attempt to decorrelate signals by subtracting the best possible linear prediction from the input signal, leaving a whitened residual signal.
Decorrelation techniques can also be used for many other purposes, such as reducing crosstalk in a multi-channel signal, or in the design of echo cancellers. 
In image processing decorrelation techniques can be used to enhance or stretch, colour differences found in each pixel of an image. This is generally termed as 'decorrelation stretching'.
The concept of decorrelation can be applied in many other fields.
In neuroscience, decorrelation is used in the analysis of the neural networks in the human visual system.
In cryptography, it is used in cipher design (see Decorrelation theory) and in the design of hardware random number generators.

The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) maintains many cemeteries specifically devoted to veterans. Most have various rules regarding what must take place in order to be interred there.
The VA only permits graphics on Government-furnished headstones or markers that are approved emblems of belief, the Civil War Union Shield (including those who served in the U.S. military through the Spanish American War), the Civil War Confederate Southern Cross of Honor, and the Medal of Honor insignia. Arlington National Cemetery has similar restrictions on headstones, though it is maintained by US Department of the Army.
The religious symbols are rendered as simple inscriptions without sculptural relief or coloring other than black.
Generally the VA adds a new symbol a few months after receiving a petition from a faith group.

CATEGORIES: Scottish Premier League seasons, 2005–06 in Scottish football leagues

The 2005–06 Scottish Premier League was won by Celtic, with a 17-point margin over their nearest challengers Hearts in the first season under the management of Gordon Strachan. Rangers, who finished third, failed to finish a Scottish top flight campaign as champions or runners-up for the first time since 1988.
As league champions, Celtic qualified for the UEFA Champions League, with runners-up Hearts also qualifying. This marked the first time since 1995 that a club outside the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers finished in the top two. Third-placed Rangers qualified for the UEFA Cup, as did Scottish Second Division champions Gretna, who took the Scottish Cup place despite losing the final to Hearts.
Livingston were relegated, and Scottish First Division winners St. Mirren were promoted.
Kris Boyd was the top scorer with 32 goals (17 for Rangers after 15 for Kilmarnock).

Julius Exter, fully Julius Leopold Bernhard Exter (September 20, 1863, Ludwigshafen am Rhein – October 16, 1939, Übersee am Chiemsee) was a German avant-garde painter whose techniques were close to the Der Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider) school of artists and who became known as the 'prince of colours' for his lively expressionism style.

Sheffield Grammar School began in 1604 as  'The Free Grammar School of James King of England within the Town of Sheffield in the County of York' in buildings in the Townhead area of Sheffield, resulting from the benefaction of John Smith of Crowland.KING EDWARD VII SCHOOL, SHEFFIELD – Prospectus, 1936 In the "Gazetteer and General Directory of Sheffield and Twenty Miles Round", by William White, published in 1852,KES MAGAZINE SPRING 1954 the author refers to the "FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL", noting that it "is a commodious and handsome stone building in Charlotte Street, erected by subscription in 1825, in lieu of the ancient school which stood near the top of Townhead Street. It was founded by letters patent of James I in 1604, and the Vicar and Church Burgesses are the trustees and governors".
It led a nomadic existence on various sites before taking over the Sheffield Collegiate School on Collegiate Crescent in 1884. 
James A. Figorski describes the premises at St. George's Square, which the school occupied in 1868, as followsKing Edward VII School Sheffield – KES MAGAZINE, JULY, 1948 [tpl]Dead link|date=May 2012|bot=BlevintronBot[/tpl] "It was a stone building which I think was in keeping with St. George's Church. From St. George's Square you entered through a stone archway and there to the left was the small caretaker's house, and then the pathway went round to the porch, into which the main door opened to the large main room of the school. The floor was stone flagged and was very cold in winter. A stove stood in the centre of the room, cracked and worn. We had no gas, and water was turned on into an old stone trough at play-hours outside the school".
thumb|Cover of the SRGS magazine, April 1899The school, at its Collegiate Crescent site, was renamed Sheffield Royal Grammar School (SRGS) in 1885. SRGS's motto was "Verbum tuum lucerna pedibus meis" – "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet". 
In 1905 Sheffield City Council acquired both Wesley College and SRGS and they were merged on the site of the former to form King Edward VII School (KES), named after the reigning monarch.

[[Ringgold Mill]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Clarksville, Tennessee, Buildings and structures in Montgomery County, Tennessee, Grinding mills in the United States

One of the earliest commercial developments in the Clarksville, Tennessee communities is the Ringgold Mill located in what is now north Clarksville. It was a grist mill that was originally built in 1810, by Thomas Rivers. The mill was situated along the banks of the Little West Fork Creek in the Ringgold Community. 
In 1853, the new owner of the property, Mr. M. D. Davie, had a stone dam built to improve the efficiency of the mill at a cost of about $10,000. He also added a house to the property in 1857. Union troops partially destroyed the mill in 1863, in an attempt to disrupt Confederate Army supplies, and in retaliation to the loyalties of the mill owner. 
Following the war, the mill was rebuilt and operated until 1885, when the mill was once again destroyed by fire as a result of lightning strike. The mill was rebuilt the same year, and improved upon by the addition of a small turbine which replaced the water wheel.
The mill received its current name in 1907, and was used until 1974. During this time it was owned by members of the Durrett family of Clarksville. It is still a beautiful point of interest in the county, but it is located on private property. The mill has also been used as a post office, library, and voter precinct location over the years.

"Bugeilio'r Gwenith Gwyn" ([tpl]lang-en|Watching the White Wheat[/tpl]) is an 18th-century traditional Welsh love song.
It describes the tragic love affair between Wil Hopcyn and Ann Thomas (The Maid of Cefn Ydfa) from the village of Llangynwyd in Glamorganshire. Ann belonged to a wealthy farming family but Wil was only a farm labourer. Ann's mother rejected Wil and forced Ann into a marriage with Anthony Maddocks, the son of a local squire.
A few days before the marriage took place Wil left Llangynwyd. Months later Wil had a dream in which Ann's new husband had died, so he returned home. However, when he arrived he discovered that in fact it was Ann who was dying, from a broken heart. Ann died in his arms that day.
Maddocks inherited the Thomas' estate and soon re-married. Wil died in 1741, never having married. Both he and Ann are buried at Llangynwyd.

The 36th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army. It was originally raised in 1916 as part of the First Australian Imperial Force during World War I. Throughout World War I the battalion served on the Western Front as part of the 9th Brigade, attached to the 3rd Division. Due to heavy casualties amongst the AIF and a decrease in the number of replacements arriving from Australia in 1918, the battalion was disbanded before the war ended in order to reinforce other units in France. The 36th Battalion was re-raised in 1921 as part of the Militia based in Sydney. During World War II the battalion was attached to the 14th Brigade and was initially used in a defensive role as a garrison unit in Australia before being sent to New Guinea in 1942. Throughout the course of the war in the Pacific, the 36th Battalion spent most of the 1942–45 period overseas in New Guinea and New Britain where they undertook operations against the Japanese.

She retired from the stage on her marriage on 22 September 1921 to Edward Raylton Joicey MC (1890–1955) and they had two sons, John and Richard. She returned to acting for the screen, appearing in Britannia of Billingsgate 1933,Britannia of Billingsgate, a comedy in four acts, by Christine Jope-Slade and Sewell Stokes, Samuel French Ltd: London 1931. a musical based on the play of the same name by Christine Jope-Slade and Sewell Stokes, followed by Road House in 1934.
Violet Mary Joicey died in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1956. Her brother was Ernest Sefton, also an actor.
Research by the Kipling Society suggests that she was the thinly-disguised music-hall singer upon whom Kipling modelled his character of "Vidal ("Dal") Bezanguen" in the humorous story "The Village That Voted The Earth Was Flat.There is a public-domain postcard picture available at http://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_villagevoted_notes.htm

[[PITI]]
CATEGORIES: Mortgage

In relation to a mortgage, PITI (pronounced like the word "pity") is an acronym for a mortgage payment that is the sum of monthly principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. That is, PITI is the sum of the monthly loan service (principal and interest) plus the monthly property tax payment, homeowners insurance premium, and, when applicable, mortgage insurance premium and homeowners association fee. For mortgagers whose property tax payments and homeowners insurance premiums are escrowed as part of their monthly housing payment, PITI therefore is the monthly "bottom line" of what they call their "mortgage payment" (although more precisely it is a combined payment of mortgage, tax, and insurance).

[[Airspace Action on Smoking and Health]]
CATEGORIES: Tobacco control, Organizations based in British Columbia

Airspace Action on Smoking and Health (formerly Airspace Non-smokers' Rights Society) is a volunteer-based anti-tobacco organization in the Canadian province of British Columbia.
Airspace Non-smokers’ Rights Society was initially founded in Victoria in the late 1970s and successfully lobbied for one of Canada’s first ever smoking control by-laws.Smoke-Free: How One City Successfully Banned Smoking in All Indoor Areas, by Barbara McLintock, Granville Island Publishing, 2004, p. 4 Dale Jackaman, then Secretary of the Victoria organization, moved to Vancouver in 1984. He and Norm Gillan founded the Vancouver branch of Airspace, and Jackaman was its first Executive Director. Jackaman then amalgamated both the Victoria and Namaimo organizations (run by Errol Povah) and formed what is now the province-wide Airspace organization. 
One aspect of the Airspace organization was its early adoption of computer technology to facilitate its activist activities. Airspace was probably the first organization of its kind to adopt a modem based bulletin board system (BBS).604 Area Code BBSes Through History Airspace was also one of the first organizations of this nature to have a web site. Some screen shots from an early version of the site turned up in internal documents from Philip Morris.Document 2047549852/9854 and Document 2084063121/3130
The organization's public persona is the Grim Reaper, used it to create a form of street theatre at tobacco promotions.
In 1993, the New Democratic Party government of the day announced regulations to prevent the sale of cigarettes to children. Airspace organized a "compliance check" (or "kiddie sting"). Ten Airspace volunteers escorted five youths aged 12 to 16 who attempted to purchase cigarettes. They visited a total of 65 tobacco retailers, and 43% of them were willing to sell cigarettes to the underaged person. This effort got significant press attention, and Burnaby-Edmonds MLA Fred Randall pressed for stronger regulations, such as stiffer fines and suspensions. The provincial government started doing compliance checks of its own to measure the effectiveness of this effort.
During the early 1990s, Airspace staged regular protests in front of Imperial Tobacco's Vancouver office. These protests included an annual "Modified Christmas Caroling", using "Clean Air Carols". These protests came to an end when Imperial Tobacco (the Canadian branch of BAT) closed the Vancouver office and moved their Western Canada operations to Calgary.

The Roxy Theatre is located in the historic downtown section of Clarksville, Tennessee in the United States. Standing on a corner of the Public Square it offers live theater shows to the public offering a wide variety of selection in the spirit of literary theater. The Roxy was built in 1947 after the 1913 Lilian Theater burned down in 1945.
The Roxy has been used as a backdrop for numerous photo shoots, films, documentaries, music videos and television commercials; most notably for Sheryl Crow's Grammy-award winning song  All I Wanna Do.
Since the early 20th century, the corner of Franklin and First has been the anchor for Clarksville’s entertainment community.  The Lillian, built in 1912, was the first theatre on this corner.  Following a fire in 1913, the Lillian was rebuilt in 1914 and saw thousands of patrons enjoying first-run movies.
Following a second fire in 1945, and with the advent of Fort Campbell, the Lillian was completely rebuilt and at last became The Roxy.  A sleek exterior, featuring a new lighting called neon, beaconed movie-goers from miles around.  Opening in 1947, The Roxy entertained Clarksvillians with first-run movies until 1980.
The Roxy sat vacant for three years until Tom Thayer and John McDonald came on the scene.  Opening on November 3, 1983, The Roxy Regional Theatre was reborn into a live theatre and quickly became “…the cornerstone of downtown re-development…”
In 1995, a professional company was created in order to supply the great demand for Shakespeare, Greek classics, school curriculum and holiday shows, and to enlarge the Roxy’s outreach services to the community.
The Roxy Regional School of the Arts was also born in 1995, offering teens extensive training in modern theatre as well as being able to work alongside professionals.  The summer offers a joint project between the Roxy and the Clarksville-Montgomery County Parks and Recreation Department, offering teens a six-week drama camp for a nominal fee.

The Chrysler Falcon was a two-seater roadster concept car designed by Virgil Exner, and built by Chrysler for the 1955 model year. The car was never put into production, but many of the ideas and styling elements used in the Falcon would be used in other Chrysler designs. Some features would not appear for many years, like the exposed side exhaust pipes which would not be used in a Chrysler production car until the Dodge Viper in 1992. The name Falcon was originally intended to be the name of the Plymouth Valiant, but Ford Motor Company released a production car with the name first, after Henry Ford II requested use of the name.Witzenburg, Gary. "The Name Game", Motor Trend, 4/84, p.82. Chrysler agreed, scrambling to change it at the last minute with a contest among their employees.Rearview Mirror: Automobile Industry History
Designed to be the basis for a competitor to the Ford Thunderbird and Chevrolet Corvette, the Falcon had a carbureted, cast iron, [tpl]convert|276|cid|l|2|abbr=on[/tpl] overhead valve V8 engine, rated at [tpl]Convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl], with [tpl]convert|255|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque, mated to a two-speed automatic transmission. With a weight of [tpl]convert|3300|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl], it gave the car impressive performance for the time. For long time everybody believed only a single vehicle was produced, which was shown at several autoshows, and eventually it was sold to a private owner, but Ghia really built three copies. One is in the Chrysler Museum and another, originally painted dark blue with white soft top, was sold in the U.S. and sent to Venezuela, where it stayed for long time, after coming back to the United States.

Richfield High School is the only public traditional high school in Richfield, Minnesota, and also the only public high school in the area that is a college preparatory school. Richfield, MN, a suburb of Minneapolis located directly south of the Minneapolis city limits.   The school, administered by Richfield Public Schools, has a total enrollment of about 1,500 students in grades 9-12.
Continuing in 2005, an effort towards realism regarding credits for students, a brand new policy has been introduced by the administration: the number of credits a student has affects their academic grade level.  Under the new system, if a student has less than eight credits, they are designated automatically as a part of the freshman class, regardless of age.
Also introduced in 2005 was the "Spartan Crew", a team primarily consisting of seniors for the purpose of orienting new freshmen and easing the transition between middle school and high school. This program is comparable to "link programs" currently in place at other area high schools. Each member of the Spartan Crew is in charge of 3-10 freshman, who become that senior's "crew".  The administration hopes that this new system will be more effective and cost-efficient than the "freshman retreats" of the past.

The organization was initially composed of a small number of comics fans and professionals from across the United States who had volunteered on an annual publication called Out in Comics, which was a listing of LGBT creators in comics that ran for three issues. These volunteers decided to form a nonprofit organization to provide services above and beyond an annual listing—feature articles and interviews, original art and content, expanded convention appearances and programming, and a full-featured website—and to pursue even more ambitious goals.

Cattleya labiata, also known as the Crimson Cattleya or Ruby-lipped Cattleya, is the type species of Cattleya, discovered in 1818 in Brazil.
This plant grows in the northeastern area of Brazil, in the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas. They grow to different sizes depending on the area from which they originate. Those that are growing in Pernambuco are smaller, with small but colored flowers, with most of them being lilac. The interior part of the flower is a dark lilac color. Plants from Alagoas are bigger and have larger flowers. Some varieties, such as Cattleya labiata var. semialba, have large white flowers with a touch of yellow. There is another variety of semialba, with lilac in the inferior part of the flower. This plant is an epiphyte, growing up in trees, where light is plentiful. However, there are also many other places where this plant could grow, such as directly on rock with very little soil.
The plant itself is a medium sized unifoliate (labiate) Cattleya, with a medium sized rhizome. The plant has long leaves, with a tough (coriaceous) consistency because of the aridity in the canopy of trees, due to a short dry season. For water requirements, the plant has a pseudobulb under every leaf to store water and nutritive substances during the short dry season. In the wet season new leaves grow rapidly, producing a large flowered inflorescence. Flowers are white or lavender colored with a darker spot in the lip. Pollination is performed by insects, usually by a scent-collecting male euglosine bee. The result is a capsule with a very large number of seeds (10,000-20,000).[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010|reason = this value seems small by a factor of 10 to 30[/tpl]
The diploid chromosome number of C. labiata has been variously determined as 2n = 40, 41, and 46.  The haploid chromosome number of C. labiata has been variously determined as n = 21 and 21.page 251 of L. P. Felix and M.

[[Sultan Shah of Khwarezm]]
CATEGORIES: 1193 deaths, Khwarezmid rulers, Year of birth unknown

Sultan Shah (died 1193) was a claimant to the title of Khwarazm Shah from 1172 until his death. He was the son of Il-Arslan.
In 1172 Il-Arslan died and his sons began fighting over who would succeed him. Sultan Shah was the younger son, but he was considered the formal heir and his mother, Terken Khatun, placed him on the throne. The elder son, Ala ad-Din Tekish, fled to the Qara Khitai and asked for them to enthrone him in place of his brother, promising an annual tribute in exchange. He was given a large army, and he soon set off for Khwarazm.
Sultan Shah and his mother, upon hearing of Tekish's approach, decided to flee, and Tekish installed himself in Khwarazm unopposed in December 1172. Sultan Shah and Terken Khatun managed to gain the support of Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba, a former Seljuk amir who had set himself up in Nishapur since the collapse of Seljuk power there. In 1174 he led an army into Khwarazm, but was defeated, captured and executed by Tekish. Following Ai-Aba's death, Sultan Shah eventually found refuge with the Ghurids, but Terken Khatun was hunted down and killed by Tekish's forces.
In the late 1170s the Qara Khitai recalled Sultan Shah, who was still living in Ghurid territory. Tekish had become rebellious, refusing to pay tribute and killing Qara Khitai officials. Sultan Shah came out of exile and a Qara Khitai army was sent to reinstate him as Khwarazm Shah. Tekish managed to halt this offensive, however, by opening the dykes of the Amu Darya, flooding the enemy's path.
The bulk of the Qara Khitai army decided to return home, but Sultan Shah convinced its commander to leave a contingent of troops with him. With this force he set of into Khurasan, still under the control of various Oghuz tribes and Seljuk amirs. He succeeded in overthrowing several local rulers, resulting in the conquest of Sarakhs, Tus and Merv by 1181. He also harassed the Ghurid territories around Baghdis.
Over the next several years Sultan Shah remained a threat to Tekish, who was forced to conduct expeditions into Khurasan several times as a result. Despite this, Sultan Shah was unable to make any significant gains against his brother. He also had occasional problems with the Ghurids; in an 1189/1190 campaign they invaded his territory, defeated him and took some of his possessions.
In 1192 Sultan Shah decided to launch an expedition against Khwarazm, taking advantage of Tekish's absence there; the latter was at the time in western Iran dealing with the Seljuks of Hamadan. While the campaign was underway, however, he died (1193) and Tekish seized some of his possessions, reuniting the Khwarazmid lands.

Zara Wright  was an American Black author based in Chicago.  Her only known published works are Black and White Tangled Threads and its sequel Kenneth, which were both published in 1920.
What information there is about her is found in the preface of her first novel, Black and White Tangled Threads, which was dedicated to her husband, J. Edward Wright.  He predeceased her and therefore the novel is dedicated to his memory. A favourable one-paragraph  review in the Chicago Defender described the book as a "realistic portrayal of individuals and events thatlifts one to the heights of earthly ambitions".Chicago Defender, December 1920, p. 8.
Both novels concern the lives of two families and contain tales of love triangles and hidden racial identities. There are also messages of racial uplift but these are secondary to the melodrama to be found in both novels.
It is not known where she was born nor how and when she died.

[[Philo Carpenter]]

CATEGORIES: 1805 births, 1886 deaths, American pharmacists, People from Chicago, Illinois, American abolitionists

Philo Carpenter (1805–1886) was Chicago, Illinois' first pharmacist,[tpl]cite web | title = About Carpenter School | url = http://www.carpenter.cps.k12.il.us/about.html | publisher = Chicago Public Schools | year = 2002 | accessdate = 2008-01-25[/tpl] and an outspoken abolitionist.
Born in Savoy, Massachusetts, February 27, 1805, young Philo learned medicine and the pharmaceutical trade in Troy, New York in the drugstore of  Amatus Robins, eventually gaining a half interest in the business. There he married Sarah Bridges in May 1830, but she died that November.
Joining the Presbyterian Church, in Troy, he gained  an interest in missionary work.  Business and religion shaped much of the rest of his life.
Hearing from his cousin of the opportunities for both business and proselytizing in the then frontier, in 1832, he sold his share of the drugstore. Shipping ahead a supply of drugs and medical equipment, he moved to Chicago, then an unincorporated village clustered around Fort Dearborn. Arriving during a cholera outbreak, he helped treat the victims.
He opened the settlement's first drug store in a log cabin on what is now Lake Street. He made enough money in two years to afford to return to the East and get remarried to Ann Thompson.[tpl]Citation |  title = Memorial Sketch of Philo Carpenter | last = Hammond | first =  Henry Laurens  | year = 1888 | location = Chicago | publisher = Fergus Printing Company [/tpl] They had seven children together.
Philo and Ann Carpenter's arrival in Chicago was a small turning point in the area's history, because they came into town in a fancy carriage. This was the first pleasure vehicle to arrive in Chicago, and the Carpenters' trip in such a carriage demonstrated that the area was safe from Indian attacks.
Carpenter invested heavily in real estate in the area surrounding what is now LaSalle Street and Wacker Drive, but the Panic of 1837 wiped him out, and his creditors took all of the land he had purchased. The area would be worth over $200 million today.[tpl]When|date=February 2012[/tpl]
His pharmaceutical business soon allowed him to become financially solvent again. A religious man, he organized the Home Sunday School of the First Presbyterian Church. He was an elder in this church until the Civil War, when members of the congregation split over whether to support the North or the South.[tpl]Citation | last = Andreas | first = A.T. | title = History of Chicago: From the Earliest Period to the Present Time | place = Chicago, IL | publisher = A.T. Andreas | year = 1884 | volume = 1 | page = 466(a) 319(b)[/tpl]
He then organized a new church, the First Congregational, and became deacon. Carpenter also was a member of the Chicago Theological Seminary, and was managing director of the Chicago Bible Society.
In 1838, Carpenter helped to form and lead the Chicago chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society, along with Dr. Charles V. Dyer, Robert Freeman, and Calvin De Wolf.[tpl]Cite book | last = Campbell | first = Tom | title = Fighting Slavery in Chicago | publisher = Ampersand Inc. | year = 2009 | location = Chicago, IL [/tpl]

[[Wyoming Monument]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania, Monuments and memorials in Pennsylvania, Buildings and structures in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, 1833 sculptures

The Wyoming Monument is an American Revolutionary War monument and gravesite located in the borough of Wyoming, Pennsylvania, in Luzerne County.
The monument marks the gravesite of the bones of victims of the Wyoming Massacre, which took place on July 3, 1778.  Local residents banded together to defend the area against an invasion of British Tories as well as pro-Tory Native Americans.  The battle ended in defeat for the colonial fighters and considerable brutality followed the battle. It was not until October 22, 1778 that a recovery party felt the region safe enough to return to begin recovery of the bodies of those slain in the battle.  The remains were gathered and interred in a common grave, only to be dug up again at public ceremonies in 1832 — ceremonies attended by some of the then elderly survivors of the massacre.  In 1833, the bones were re-interred in a vault under the present monument.
Ownership of the monument is held by the Wyoming Monument Association, originally formed as the Ladies Monumental Association.  It is one of the oldest all-female historical groups in the United States.
Each year, beginning in 1878 for the 100th anniversary of the battle, a commemorative ceremony is held on the grounds of the stone obelisk. The ceremony is sponsored by the Wyoming Commemorative Association.
On August 2, 2008, the monument was struck by lightning, causing some damage and putting the monument in need of repairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citizensvoice.com/articles/2008/08/05/news/wb_voice.20080805.t.pg2.cv05cdmonument_s1.1856134_top7.txt|title=Wyoming Monument needs repairs|date=2008-08-13|work=|publisher=Citizen's Voice[/tpl] In 2010, the restoration began and the monument, completely repaired and restored, was rededicated at the annual celebration of the Wyoming Commemorative Association on July 4, 2011.

John Hailstone (1759–1847), English geologist, born near London on 13 Dec. 1759, was placed at an early age under the care of a maternal uncle at York, and was sent to Beverley school in the East Riding. Samuel Hailstone was a younger brother. John went to Cambridge, entering first at Catharine Hall, and afterwards at Trinity College, and was second wrangler of his year (1782).[tpl]acad|id=HLSN778J|name=Hailstone, John[/tpl] He was elected fellow of Trinity in 1784, and four years later became Woodwardian Professor of Geology, an office which he held for thirty years.
He went to Germany, and studied geology under Werner at Freiburg for about twelve months. On his return to Cambridge he devoted himself to the study and collection of geological specimens, but did not deliver any lectures. He published, however, in 1792, ‘A Plan of a course of lectures.’ The museum was considerably enriched by him. He married, and retired to the vicarage of Trumpington, near Cambridge, in 1818, and worked zealously for the education of the poor of his parish. He devoted much attention to chemistry and mineralogy, as well as to his favourite science, and kept for many years a meteorological diary. He made additions to the Woodwardian Museum, and left manuscript journals of his travels at home and abroad, and much correspondence on geological subjects. He was elected to the Linnean Society in 1800, and to the Royal Society in 1801, and was one of the original members of the Geological Society. Hailstone contributed papers to the ‘Transactions of the Geological Society’ (1816, iii. 243–50), the ‘Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society’ (1822, i. 453–8), and the British Association (Report, 1834, p. 569). He died at Trumpington on 9 June 1847, in his eighty-eighth year.Hailstone, John (1759–1847), geologist, by H. R. Tedder, Dictionary of National Biography, Published 1890

WGRF is a radio station in Buffalo, New York, USA. The station's on air branding is "97 Rock". The station mostly plays Classic rock from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Since 2006, the station has also aired numerous rock-leaning oldies, such as songs from The Beatles, that were displaced by the format change at sister station WHTT.
WGRF broadcasts at 96.9 MHz.
The WGRF morning show consists of Larry Norton, Rob Lederman, Chris Klein and their Producer Russ. Other local disc jockeys include John "J.P." Piccollo, Carl Russo, John Hager, Slick Tom Tiberi, Anita West, Jeff Gordon, Cindy Chan, Megan Davis, Jim McGee, and Rick Walters. WGRF's significant local presence and history in the area has made the station nearly as much of the Buffalo culture as chicken wings.
WGRF is owned by Cumulus Media. Previous owners included the Taft Television and Radio Company, Rich Communications, Mercury Radio Communications (who separated the longtime combination with WGR in 1995 when it bought WGRF from Rich Communications, who in turn retained WGR until selling it to the Sinclair Broadcast Group two years later), and Citadel Broadcasting (which merged with Cumulus on September 14, 2011[tpl]cite news|title=Cumulus now owns Citadel Broadcasting|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2011/09/16/cumulus-now-owns-citadel-broadcasting.html|accessdate=September 16, 2011|newspaper=Atlanta Business Journal|date=September 16, 2011[/tpl]). Its transmitter is located in Buffalo.
WGRF streamed its programming on the Internet up until 2002, when it became economically unfeasible for some stations to continue their streams given changes in licensing and royalty agreements. In March 2006, Citadel launched an initiative that provided for the streaming of many of Citadel's stations. WGRF was one of them, and was among the first commercial stations in Buffalo to resume streaming after the earlier changes.
WGRF stopped being the only classic rock station in Buffalo when it began having rivalry with CIXL-FM, which changed formats from adult hits to classic rock in 2008.

The striking surface is usually a hand or a foot, but may also be a fingertip, toe, head, elbow, knuckle, or knee. The most common object is a piece of wood, though it is also common to break bricks or cinder blocks.
Breaking can often be seen in karate, taekwondo and pencak silat. Spetsnaz are also known for board and brick breaking, but not all styles of martial arts use place equal emphasis on it or use it. In styles where striking and kicking is less important and there is an emphasis on grappling or weaponry, breaking is less prominent. Traditional Japanese martial art schools place little, if any, emphasis on board-breaking, although the art of breaking objects was known as tameshiwari, while the similar practice of Tameshigiri or 'test cutting' is used in sword arts.

The Deacy Amp is a small, one-watt, roughly [tpl]convert|5|in|cm|1[/tpl] amplifier created by and named after Queen bassist John Deacon and used by guitarist Brian May.  
It was created in the early 1970s using an amplifier circuit board found in a skip by Deacon and fitted into a Hi-Fi speaker cabinet, powered by a 9-volt battery. The amplifier had no volume or tone controls for most of its history and was never broken or repaired. It was used along with May's Red Special guitar and his treble-booster to produce sounds reminiscent of various orchestral instruments, such as violin, cello, trombone, clarinet, or even vocals, starting from the songs "Procession" and "The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke" from the 1974 album ‘’Queen II’’.

[[Dafydd y Garreg Wen]]
CATEGORIES: Welsh folk songs, Year of song unknown

Dafydd y Garreg Wen is a traditional Welsh air and folk song.
David Owen, the famous harper and composer, lived near Porthmadog in Caernarfonshire, Wales in the first half of the 18th century, who was known locally as Dafydd y Garreg Wen, ([tpl]Lang-en|David of the White Rock[/tpl]). The epithet Y Garreg Wen ([tpl]Lang-en|The White Rock[/tpl]) was the name of the farm near Morfa Bychan in which he lived.
Tradition has it that as Owen lay on his death bed, he called for his harp and composed the haunting air. He died at the age of 29 and was buried at St Cynhaearn's Church near Porthmadog.Befriend a church, BBC North Wales, accessed 5 August 2010
The words were added nearly a hundred years later in by the poet John Ceiriog Hughes.
A more literal translation would be:-
Another version of this song begins with the line, "David, the Bard, on his bed of death lies", and continues with the second line of the verse being, "Pale are his features, and dim are his eyes". Owen is also well known for his air Codiad yr Ehedydd ([tpl]Lang-en|Rising of the lark[/tpl]).
In 1923 the British Broadcasting Company made its first broadcast in Wales, from "Station 5WA" in Cardiff. Mostyn Thomas opened the programme, singing Dafydd y Garreg Wen, and so it became the very first Welsh language song to play on the air.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-21426191|title=Broadcasting in Wales: 90 years since BBC went on air|first=Neil|last=Prior|date=13 February 2013|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl]

Truck owners also paid bribes in order to get into the program.
The Hired Truck Program officially came to an end Monday, September 18, 2006. At the end of the work day on Friday, September 15, 2006, the final eight Hired Trucks were laid off permanently.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

[[Two-liter bottle]]
CATEGORIES: Bottles, Metrication

The two-litre bottle is a common container for soft drinks. These bottles are produced from polyethylene terephthalate, also known as PET plastic, using the blow molding process. Bottle labels consist of a printed, tight-fitted plastic sleeve. A resealable screw-top allows the contents to be used at various times while retaining carbonation.
In the United States, the two litre bottle is one of the few cases where a product is sold by a round number of metric units. Since very few other beverages are sold in this exact quantity, the term "two-litre" in American English almost invariably refers to a soft drink bottle. Other common metric sizes for plastic soft drink bottles include 500 millilitres, 1 litre and 3 litres.
In some other countries like Russia plastic bottles are used for selling beer as well.

Albert, Baron Frère (born 4 February 1926 in Fontaine-l'Évêque near Charleroi, Belgium) is a Belgian businessman and the richest man in Belgium.
Frère grew up as a son of a nail merchant and helped in the business since an early age. His father died when Frère was 17; Frère had to leave school and run the family business by himself. At the age of 30, he started investing in  Belgian steel factories and by the end of the 1970s he practically controlled the whole steel industry in the region of Charleroi. He foresaw the coming steel crisis of the late 1970s and sold his enterprises to the Belgian state after merging them with the competing steel firm Cockerill to create Cockerill-Sambre.
Frère used the proceeds from this sale to build an investment empire around the Swiss holding company Pargesa which he founded with the Canadian investor Paul Desmarais. Pargesa took over the Belgian holding company Groupe Bruxelles Lambert in 1982 and over the year added significant stakes in such wide ranging Belgian companies as Petrofina, Royale Belge Insurance, Compagnie Luxembourgoise de Télédiffusion (CLT), and Tractebel. He actively promoted international consolidation of the sectors in which he was involved, selling Banque Bruxelles Lambert to ING Group, Royale Belge to Axa, Tractebel to Suez, Petrofina to Total S.A., and RTL to Bertelsmann.
Frère is married and has three children. In 2002, he received the title of baron from the Belgian king Albert II. He is a co-owner, together with Bernard Arnault of LVMH, of the Château Cheval Blanc winery near Bordeaux. He is a member of the Cercle Gaulois.

[[Eaton Constantine]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in Shropshire, Shrewsbury and Atcham

Eaton Constantine is a small village in the English county of Shropshire. It is located just off the B4380 road, between Atcham and Buildwas, near The Wrekin hill.
The theologian Richard Baxter (1615–1691) lived here in his boyhood. His childhood home, now called Baxter's House (a private residence), is a 16th-century timber-framed house in the centre of the village.
Near Eaton Constantine are the remains of a Roman vexillation fortress and three marching camps near a bend in the River Severn. The fortress lies in open farmland on a low south-eastward projecting spur between Ranslet House and Eye Farm. It was defended by a triple-ditch system measuring about 920 x 1,050 feet (c.280 x 320m) within the defences, which enclosed an area of just under 22¼ acres (c.9ha). This substantial defensive system indicates that this was no ordinary marching encampment, and its size would have been sufficient to house a substantial force of around 2,500 Roman legionaries and auxiliary soldiers. The fortress was probably occupied by a contingent of Legio XIV Gemina, together with a couple of auxiliary cavalry units.
The place-name 'Eaton Constantine' does not refer to the Roman military presence; 'Eaton' means 'island town or settlement', and the land was held by Thomas de Cotentin (in Normandy) in 1242.Eilert Ekwall, Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names

[[Frodesley]]
CATEGORIES: Civil parishes in Shropshire, Villages in Shropshire

Frodesley is a tiny village and civil parish in the English county of Shropshire, and is situated partly within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. 
The name probably derives from an Anglo-Saxon chief "Frod" who was the founder,and leah or clearing. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book: one hide paying tax,land for two ploughs, woodland for 30 pigs, valued at eight shillings. Most of Frodesley extends perpendicular to the south-west extension the Roman road Watling Street, running from Wroxeter (Viroconium) to Leintwardine (Bravonium or Branogenium) - Iter XII of the Antonine Itinerary. An important route built in the 1st century AD, the stretch here has been in continuous use. 
The parish has an area of about 900 hectares and lies between two hills, one at 145 metres on arable land, the other Lodge Hill rising to 304 metres and forested. The latter consists of Hoar Edge Grit, a tough Ordovician sandstone quarried for the construction of Viroconium. The forest is also known as Causeway Wood, possibly on account of a Roman track used to convey stone to the main road. There is a conjecture that this causeway corresponds to a bridleway running from the north-east edge of the forest.
On the edge of the hill lies an imposing mansion built in 1591, Frodesley Lodge, home of the then local landowning Scriven family. A document from 1848 mentions the discovery there of a Roman votive altar dedicated to the goddesses of Britain and bearing the name L Caractacus. Formerly isolated, the Lodge now lies amongst recent barn conversion dwellings. Adjacent to the Lodge is the venerable and frail Frodesley oak, more than 700 years old.
Dating from 1809 on much earlier foundations, the church of St Mark's is one of the smallest in Shropshire. 
In recent years the population has increased to around 100; until July 2006 there was a public house, the Swan.
Sir Herbert Edwardes, the 19th century soldier-administrator in India, known as the "Hero of Multan", was born at Frodesley when his father was local Rector.  The Rectory later became 'Hobsley House'.
The area is agricultural, predominantly livestock 
with some arable. 
Nearby villages are Acton Burnell and Longnor.

Cyathea cunninghamii, also known as the gully tree fern and slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Victoria, New South Wales, southeastern Queensland and Tasmania in Australia, as well as North Island, South Island and Chatham Islands in New Zealand (and possibly New Caledonia also). It grows in damp forest, often emerging from stream gullies and riverbanks. The erect trunk may be 20 m tall and is usually 6-15 cm in diameter, occasionally as much as 20 cm. Fronds are tri- to tetrapinnate and 3 m or more in length. The rachis and stipe are slender, black brown, warty and covered with brown scales. Sori occur along each side of the pinnule midvein and are covered by hood-like indusia. C. cunninghamii is an uncommon and slow-growing tree fern. Great specimens occur in Tarra-Bulga National Park, Victoria.
Plants from New Caledonia known as Cyathea stelligera may represent the same species. In the wild, C. cunninghamii hybridises with Cyathea australis to form the fertile hybrid Cyathea × marcescens.
To do well in cultivation, C. cunninghamii requires much moisture. Rich humus is a good growing medium. Plants should be protected from the wind.
The specific epithet cunninghamii commemorates Allan Cunningham (1791-1839), a botanist who traveled widely in Australia and New Zealand.

[[Harnage]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in Shropshire

Harnage is a small village in the English county of Shropshire. It is located just SE of the village of Cound and the nearest notable settlement is Cressage.
Harnage is considered a hamlet, not a village, as it does not have a post office. One road runs through the hamlet, passing residences, Harnage Farm, and Harnge House, a 17th-century house built on the site of an older mansion, allegedly dating back to the 11th or 12th century. The land was owned in the 12th century by Richard de Harnage, the progenitor of the Harnage family in England and in the USA. The name derives from the old English and means "rocky edge", which describes the area to a tee. It is completely agricultural. At the NW end of the road running through Harnage is the village of Cound (pronounced Koond) and at the other end is a junction at the foot of the hill, that runs into the place called Harnage Grange, a farm consortium, which, in ancient times pre-Henry VIII, used to be the homefarm of Buildwas Abbey and Wenlock Priory, a few miles away near the village of Much Wenlock.

[[Buyer brokerage]]
CATEGORIES: Sales occupations, Real estate

A buyer brokerage or buyer agency is the practice of real estate brokers and their agents representing a buyer in a real estate transaction rather than, by default, representing the seller either directly or as a sub-agent. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the most common term is buying agent.
In most U.S. states and Canadian provinces, until the 1990s, buyers who worked with an agent of a real estate broker in finding a house were customers of the brokerage, since, by most common law of most states at the time, the broker represented only sellers. It is only since the early 1990s that states passed statute law to create buyers' agency.
Buyer agency can exist exclusively (where a brokerage firm chooses to only represent buyers and never sellers, as an exclusive buyer agent) or, in a full-service company, by offering buyer agency to buyers who become clients. Buyers would have to agree to some form of dual agency in the event that they wished to buy a home which that company has listed for sale and for which it represents the seller.
Today, if the buyer is working with a broker other than the brokerage listing the property, he or she may choose to enter into a buyer-brokerage agreement to be represented. (In some cases where dual agency is permitted by law, even the listing broker may represent the buyer). If the buyer does not enter into this agreement, he/she remains a customer of the broker who is then the sub-agent of seller's broker.

The T-18 and its derivatives were essentially unsuccessful designs, but they gave Soviet industry its first experiences in designing armoured vehicles, and in the meantime a number of foreign tank designs were available for production.

The Battle of Connecticut Farms, fought June 7, 1780, was one of the last major battles between British and American forces in the northern colonies during the American Revolutionary War.  Hessian General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, in command of the British garrison at New York City, made an attempt to reach the principal Continental Army encampment at Morristown, New Jersey.  Knyphausen's advance was strongly met by companies of the New Jersey militia at Connecticut Farms (present-day Union Township).  After stiff resistance, the militia were forced to withdraw, but the battle and skirmishing that preceded it sufficiently delayed Knyphausen's advance that he remained there for the night.  After realizing that further advance on Morristown would probably be met by even more resistance, Knyphausen withdrew back toward New York.

Being 26 years old, he was one of the youngest PhDs in Cracow.
Soon before graduation, in 1997, Minakowski accepted an editorial post at OptimusNet (now Onet.pl), where he built the leading Polish financial site, OnetBiznes, which by the end of the year 2000 turned to be a most-read source of financial information in Poland. Later, he switched to search business, as a director of Search at Onet.pl.
With this double background (logical formalization of texts and managing large Internet database systems), Minakowski was able to cope with his idée fixe and started building the genealogical database of the whole Polish historical élites.
For the beginning, Minakowski prepared the densely tagged XML edition of Adam Boniecki's Herbarz Polski (originally 17 volumes or 6500 pages published between 1899 and 1913, with genealogies of about 0.3 million people living since 13th to 20th century). The edition is available at CD-ROM since 2003.
The next stage was building a GEDCOM database of all people related genealogically to the icons of the Golden Age of Polish culture: Jan Kochanowski and Mikołaj Rej. The first edition, published in 2005 under the title Ci wielcy Polacy to nasza rodzina. Not only Minakowski connected about 170,000 individuals to both of them, but also found that every fifth person out of 25,000 described in the Polski Słownik Biograficzny is related to them (with a finite chain of three relations: being son of, being parent of and being spouse of).
Currently Minakowski focuses on building the database of descendants of all members of the Great Sejm. He is the chairman (Marszałek) of Stowarzyszenie Potomków Sejmu Wielkiego (the Society of the Descendants of the Great Sejm, SPSW), organization similar to Sons of the American Revolution.

CATEGORIES: Sound production technology

CardTalk is an inexpensive cardboard phonograph for playing recordings, mainly voice, made on vinyl records. The name was used by Global recordings network, a Christian missionary movement which used the device from the 1960s to play religious talks in remote parts of the world that did not have electricity. It consists of a flat piece of cardboard creased and folded into a triangle.  The base has a nub to hold the record in place. The upper "arm" forms the "pointy" part of the triangle and has a needle which is placed upon the record.  The record is spun using a small pointed object like a pencil.  The cardboard picks up the impressions on the record and vibrates loud enough to be heard causing the "Card" to "Talk". Several cardboard phonograph playing devices were patented around the same period and these include Jauquet (1953) for a "Pocket Speaking Device", J.S. Wiener's "Sound Emitting Device" (1967) and the "Record Player" of Max Meier-Maletz (1972).http://www.google.com/patents/US3535182https://www.google.com/patents/US2859974https://www.google.com/patents/US3415526

The [tpl]convert|700|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] property is located over the mountain from the village of Pine Grove Mills, Pennsylvania along Shaver's Creek.  Hiking and fishing are among the activities available to visitors.
The Pennsylvania State University contracted with the federal government in 1940 to construct roads and buildings on the land to help the school's educational program. In 1954 the land was given fully to the university. A dam was finished in 1960 to give easy access to the area, and Stone Valley Recreation Area was created.
Stone Valley Recreation Area is a multi-use park that is shared by the Penn State Forestry department, Shaver's Creek Environmental Center and Stone Valley Vertical Adventures.
Vertical Adventures, which is operated by Penn State Athletics is a multi-element high-ropes challenge course serving the university and surrounding community with team development and group building.  It also hosts a small summer program for middle school and high school children.
The lake at Stone Valley Recreation Area was drained in 2008 when state regulations regarding dam specifications changed.  Penn State is currently undertaking efforts to begin repairing the dam with the intention of filling it for the 2013 season.

CATEGORIES: Video game magazines, Defunct magazines of the United States, Publications established in 1999, American video game magazines

The Official Dreamcast Magazine was a video game magazine for the Dreamcast published in the United States. The magazine's initial issue "0" was released in June 1999, a full 3 months before the launch of the system. This issue featured Sonic the Hedgehog on a black cover, along with the launch date and some of the system's unique features. The magazine then ran for twelve issues from the September 1999 Dreamcast launch to March/April 2001, shortly after Dreamcast was discontinued. Each issue came with a GD-ROM with demos of Dreamcast games. The final issue did not come with a disc. This was explained as Sega looking for a new way to distribute demos. The cancellation was apparently unexpected as the magazine promised more information about demo distribution in future issues and had a preview for the next issue where Phantasy Star Online was to be reviewed. Many of the staff went on to work for Official Xbox Magazine.
In fact the cancellation was not altogether unexpected by the staff, and had the magazine not been folded by the publisher, it's unlikely another issue would have shipped as the staff refused to work on an issue they thought (correctly) would never ship.
The magazine was published bimonthly, but during the 2000 holiday season, issues were sold monthly due to additional relevant content being available for the shopping season.

Petar Pop-Arsov (1868, Bogomila, present day Čaška Municipality, Republic of Macedonia - 1941, Sofia, Bulgaria) was a Bulgarian revolutionary from Macedonia, one of the founders of "The Committee for Obtaining the Political Rights Given to Macedonia by the Congress of Berlin" from which, as Petar Poparsov says in his writings, later developed the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), IMRO is the most commonly used name for the organization in which Petar Poparsov participated, although it is certain that in some his active days, the organization had a different name. What that name was is a matter of considerable dispute between historians from Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia. According to Bulgarian historians the name of the organization from 1896 to 1902 was Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees (BMARC), and it was meant only for Bulgarians, while according to ethic Macedonian historians the name of the organization was Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO) from 1896 to 1905, and it was meant for all ethnic Macedonians.

German submarine ''U-803'' was a German Type IXC/40 U-boat built during World War II at Bremerhaven. This Type had long range cruising capacity and eight torpedo tubes. She was completed in September 1943 and spent the next seven months on working up cruises in the Baltic Sea near Swinemunde in order to get the crew and boat ready for operational cruising in the Battle of the Atlantic, which was at a critical stage.
As the boat worked up on 27 April 1944, just days off its intended first cruise, she struck a sea mine in the bay and sank, nine of her crew going down with the boat, and 35 being rescued by nearby ships. The boat was salvaged in August 1944, but was too badly damaged to repair, and was broken up for components for use in other U-boats. Her surviving crew were largely transferred to other units, principally [tpl]GS|U-3009||2[/tpl], on which they surrendered in May 1945. The mine had been air-dropped over the bay by the Royal Air Force, who had realised the use that the area was being put to through photo-reconnaissance flights. The air-dropping of mines was a frequent tactic of the RAF, and achieved dividends off many German harbours.

[[Tetrapolitan Confession]]

CATEGORIES: 1530 works, Reformed confessions of faith, Protestant Reformation

The Tetrapolitan Confession, also called the Confessio Tetrapolitana, Strasbourg Confession, or Swabian Confession, was the official confession of the followers of Huldrych Zwingli and the first confession of the reformed church.  "Tetrapolitan", formed by the Greek "Tetra", meaning "four", and "Politan", meaning "city", or "Municipal", consisted of four cities: Strasbourg, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau.  It was written mostly by Martin Bucer with the help of Wolfgang Capito in 1530 (during the Diet of Augsburg) in order to bring Zwinglianist Christians into theological consistency.  At the time Zwinglianists were excluded from Lutheranism because of differences in significant points of theology (i.e. Sacramental Union vs. Memorialism, etc.).
The Confession consists of 23 chapters, and is rather similar to the Augsburg Confession in both format and theology, and retains the same essence of moderation.  However the first chapter does state that nothing should be taught except that which is explicitly stated in Scripture, a statement that is not found in the Augsburg Confession, although this has always been a major principle of Lutheran theology.  
The Confession never fully took hold, however, because the more clear and logical Calvinist confessions were generally more appealing, and the remaining four Zwinglian cities all signed the Lutheran Confession in order to be a part of the defensive Schmalkaldic League. Bucer, however, stayed true to his confession and recited it even on his deathbed.

North American area code 513 serves southwest Ohio including Cincinnati and many surrounding cities, such as Forest Park, Hamilton, Lebanon, West Chester, Mason, Middletown, Norwood, Oxford, Harrison, Cleves, Miamitown and Trenton.  
It is one of the original area codes established in 1947, and originally covered the entire southwest quadrant of the state.  In 1996, however, most of the northern and eastern portion of the old 513 territory, including Dayton, was split into area code 937.  The split came about mainly due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers.  The supply of numbers was further limited because the Cincinnati LATA extends some distance into Northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana, and several numbers in northern Kentucky's 606 (now in 859) and southern Indiana's 812 weren't available for use.  Indeed, years after the introduction of number portability, 513 is still used to this day by a large number of cell phone users on the Kentucky and Indiana sides of the Cincinnati area.
A new area code 283 has been assigned to overlay the current 513 area, but this has been delayed as the 513 area code has not yet been depleted of available numbers.Pending Area Code Exhausts. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. October 2006.

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream is a novel by Hunter S. Thompson, illustrated by Ralph Steadman. The book is a roman à clef, rooted in autobiographical incidents. The story follows its protagonist, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, as they descend on Las Vegas to chase the American Dream through a drug-induced haze, all the while ruminating on the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement. The work is Thompson's most famous, and is noted for its lurid descriptions of illegal drug use, its early retrospective on the culture of the 1960s, and its popularization of Thompson's highly-subjective blend of fact and fiction that has become known as gonzo journalism.   The novel first appeared as a two-part series in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, was printed as a book in 1972, and was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1998 by Terry Gilliam, starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro who portrayed Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, respectively.

Tua Pek Kong ([tpl]zh|c=大伯公|p=Dàbó Gōng[/tpl] Hakka: Thai phak koong: Hokkien: Tuā-peh-kong), literally means "Grand Uncle", is one of the pantheon of Malaysian Chinese Gods. It was believed the date Tua Pek Kong arrived in Penang was 40 years before Francis Light in 1746.
Tua Pek Kong was a man named Zhang Li (张理) from the Hakka clan. His Sumatra-bound boat was struck by wind and accidentally landed on Penang island of Malaysia, which at that time had only 50 inhabitants. After his death, the local people began worshipping him and built the Tua Pek Kong temple there. Today Tua Pek Kong is worshipped by Malaysian Chinese throughout the country. Tua Pek Kong is often mistaken for Tu Di Gong, partially because of their physical similarities.
Chung Keng Quee was a principal donor to the Haichu-yu (Sea Pearl) Tua Pek Kong Temple (1865 and 1868) in Tanjung Tokong, Penang. Another famous temple is the Tua Pek Kong Temple, Sibu with its 7-storey pagoda and has become a landmark for Sibu.

Tirigan was the last Gutian ruler in Sumer, who ruled for 40 days before being defeated by Utu-hengal of Uruk, ca. 2050 BC (short chronology).Encyclopædia Britannica, 'Tirigan'The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?simplesearchword=tirigan&simplesearch=translation&searchword=&charenc=gcirc&lists=
"Tirigan ruled for 40 days. 21 kings; they  ruled for { (ms. L1+N1 has:) 124 years and 40 days } { (ms. Su3+Su4 has instead:) 25 years }. Then the army of Gutium was { defeated } { (ms. TL has instead:) destroyed } and the kingship was taken to Unug.
The victory of Utu-ḫeĝal: c.2.1.6
The enemy troops established themselves everywhere. Tirigan, the king of Gutium …… the mouths of the channels (?). Nobody came out of his city to face him; he already occupied both banks of the Tigris. In the south, in Sumer, he blocked the water from the fields, in the uplands he closed off the roads. Because of him the grass grew high on the highways of the land.
The victory of Utu-ḫeĝal: c.2.1.6
After departing from the temple of Iškur, on the fourth day he set up camp (?) in Naĝsu on the Surungal canal, and on the fifth day he set up camp (?) at the shrine at Ili-tappê. He captured Ur-Ninazu and Nabi-Enlil, generals of Tirigan sent as envoys to Sumer, and put them in handcuffs.
The victory of Utu-ḫeĝal: c.2.1.6
Then Tirigan the king of Gutium ran away alone on foot. He thought himself safe in Dabrum, where he fled to save his life; but since the people of Dabrum knew that Utu-ḫeĝal was a king endowed with power by Enlil, they did not let Tirigan go, and an envoy of Utu-ḫeĝal arrested Tirigan together with his wife and children in Dabrum. He put handcuffs and a blindfold on him. Before Utu, Utu-ḫeĝal made him lie at his feet and placed his foot on his neck. He made Gutium, the fanged (?) snake of the mountains drink again from the crevices (?), he ……, he …… and he …… boat. He brought back the kingship of Sumer."

In computing, a hidden directory or hidden file is a directory (folder) or file which file system utilities do not display by default. They are commonly used for storing user preferences or preserving the state of a utility and are frequently created implicitly by using various utilities. Usually the intent is to not "clutter" the display of the contents of a directory with files the user did not create.[tpl]cite web|url=http://new.linuxfocus.org/English/March1998/article24.html |title=Configuring X: What are all those dotfiles for anyway? |publisher=Linux Focus |date=March 1998 |accessdate=2013-09-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html|title=Sample .bashrc and .bash_profile Files|publisher=Linux Documentation Project[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-config/index.html |title=Understanding Linux configuration files |publisher=IBM.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13[/tpl]

[[State Line Tack]]

CATEGORIES: Companies based in Rockingham County, New Hampshire

State Line Tack, a division of TABcom, LLC,[tpl]cite web|title=Tabcom Brands|url=http://tabcom.com/overview/[/tpl] is an equine products and supplies retailer. Beginning as a single outlet in Plaistow, New Hampshire in 1980, on the state line between New Hampshire and Massachusetts, State Line Tack converted an old barn into a two story retail tack store.  At that time, it offered the largest selection of horse supplies in a single location nationwide, and offered more reasonably priced lines of inventory than most of its competitors.  It grew into a direct mail catalog retailer within a few years after being purchased by mail order pet supply giant Sporting Dog Specialties. In 1996, PetSmart, Inc. acquired Sporting Dog Specialties and its subsidiary State Line Tack for $45 million mostly paid in company stock, and opened more than 160 full-size (about 3,000 square feet) equine departments inside PetSmart stores. The Plaistow store moved to Salem, New Hampshire, expanding to over [tpl]convert|10000|sqft|m2[/tpl].
In 2007, PetSmart put the State Line Tack name and catalog/internet business up for sale, closing all stores and the Fulfillment Center in Brockport, New York.  In 2007, it became a subsidiary of TABcom, LLC and continues to operate as an online retailer.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34758

[[KXDocker]]

CATEGORIES: KDE software, Application launchers, Linux windowing system-related software

KXDocker is a program for the Linux operating system created by Ing. Stefano Zingarini. It resembles the "Dock" of Mac OS X in that it is mainly used as an application launcher. It supports themes, plugins and a few extra features (there is documentation on creating your own themes). Other such docks available for Linux and KDE include Kiba-dock (implements physics simulation allowing the application icons to be dragged around and initially looked to be more suitable for the GNOME desktop environment), Kooldock and Ksmoothdock. While Kiba-dock is popular for its tag-along with 3D window managers (i.e. AIGLX with Beryl), KXDocker seems to be the choice for those who seek "simple yet powerful" alternatives.
KXDocker was made for Linux distributions using KDE. However, KXDocker also works with GNOME, as outlined by the author. It is free software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
According to the project's website, KXDocker is, or soon will be, discontinued, giving way to its successor - "XQDE". However, it seems currently there is not much stated in the XQDE project page (aside from a few insights) and thus we can assume it is still in its infancy. It will be built upon Qt 4 and the author writes "it will gain all Compiz (Beryl) power", which may mean it will have better integration with the compositing window manager.

[[Monopole, Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory]]

CATEGORIES: Particle experiments

MACRO (Monopole, Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory) was a particle physics experiment located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Abruzzo, Italy.  A number of universities contributed personnel and equipment, including Boston University and University of L'Aquila.
The primary goal of MACRO was to search for magnetic monopoles. The active elements of MACRO were liquid scintillator and streamer tubes, optimized for  high resolution tracking and timing.  This design also allowed MACRO to operate as a neutrino detector and as a cosmic ray observatory.
The experiment ceased operating in 2001.[tpl]cite news|title=MACRO delivers its final word on monopoles |author=Giorgio Giacomelli and Laura Patrizii, Bologna |url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28847 |newspaper=CERN Courier |date=May 1, 2003 |accessdate=December 16, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63xk5RkxQ|archivedate=December 16, 2011[/tpl] No monopole candidates were detected, meaning that the flux of monopoles is less than 5.6×10−15 per square centimetre per steradian per second (cm−2sr−1s−1) for velocities between one ten thousandth and one thousandth of the speed of light (between thirty thousand and three hundred thousand metres per second).[tpl]cite journal |author=S. Ahlen et al.|year=1994 |title=Search for slowly moving magnetic monopoles with the MACRO detector|journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=608–612 |publisher=The American Physical Society|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.608 |accessdate=December 16, 2011 |bibcode = 1994PhRvL..72..608A [/tpl]
The magnetic monopole is a theorized particle that has not yet been observed. It is a possible solution to Maxwell's equations. One researcher claimed to have observed a monopole with a light-bulb-sized detector. The fact that a detector the size of multiple football pitches (MACRO) has not yet duplicated this feat leads most to disregard the earlier claim.
The MACRO project included a large underground cavern, approximately 800 metres underground, which was further hollowed out and housed hundreds of long chambers filled with scintillating fluid – a fluid that gives off photons when a charged or magnetic particle passes through it. At opposing ends of the chamber were a pair of photomultiplier tubes. Photomultiplier tubes contain a number of small charged "plates." They look like flood lights, but they are collectors that can take a handful of photons and "multiply" them.  This multiplication begins by using the photo-electric effect to convert photons that hit the first "plate" into electrons. These electrons are then attracted to the next plate which gives off more electrons that it receives. The next plate does the same, thus amplifying the signal more at each plate. The photomultipliers used in the MACRO experiment were produced by Thorn-EMI, and were sensitive to a signal as small as five photons. After decommissioning, MACRO donated about 800 photomultiplier tubes to the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment.  The exact voltage put on each plate was determined by a custom circuit board designed by some of the scientists involved with the project. The project leader at Boston University was Prof. James Stone.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
The scintillating chambers were assembled into high stacks and long rows. When a signal was detected, it was usually detected in multiple chambers. The timing of each signal from each photomultiplier told the approximate path and speed of the particle. The type of signal and the speed through the "pool" of chambers told researchers if they had observed a monopole or merely some common charged particle.

Love is War is Vanilla Ninja's fourth studio album, released by EMI Music Germany in May 2006. This is the first album by girls as a three-piece band. The process of recording took about 6 months. Most of the songs are co-written by the band members - Lenna and Piret, what makes this album the most personal for girls. For example the song "Kingdom Burning Down" tells a story of their fight with ex producer and as girls say "every song is dedicated to someone and they have important meaning for us".Love is War album page 
The first single from this album was "Dangerzone", which was quite successful in Germany and Poland. Vanilla Ninja performed this song on Sopot International Song Festival in Poland. Later, the single "Rockstarz" was released. However, due to many release date changes caused by EMI, the single did not chart well and girls were dropped from the label.

[[Gaussian filter]]

CATEGORIES: Linear filters, Gaussian function

In electronics and signal processing, a Gaussian filter is a filter whose impulse response is a Gaussian function (or an approximation to it). Gaussian filters have the properties of having no overshoot to a step function input while minimizing the rise and fall time. This behavior is closely connected to the fact that the Gaussian filter has the minimum possible group delay. It is considered the ideal time domain filter, just as the sinc is the ideal frequency domain filter.Filtering in the Time and Frequency Domains by Herman J. Blinchikoff, Anatol I. Zverev  These properties are important in areas such as oscilloscopeshttp://www.radiomuseum.org/forumdata/users/4767/file/Tektronix_VerticalAmplifierCircuits_Part1.pdf and digital telecommunication systems.http://www.picosecond.com/objects/AN-7a.pdf
Mathematically, a Gaussian filter modifies the input signal by convolution with a Gaussian function; this transformation is also known as the Weierstrass transform.

The youngest child of Dutch and Swedish immigrants, Ridderhof was one of the first  graduates of Columbia International University in 1923.  In 1930, she traveled to Honduras, establishing her ministry in Marcala and neighboring villages.  Forced to return to the United States to recover from malaria, she began make Spanish evangelizing recordings that she distributed to places in Latin America, including Marcala.  She was then contacted and asked to produce some Navajo recordings, Navajo speakers would they provide.  She accepted, and then she got more jobs.  This led her to form Gospel Recordings in 1939.
Gospel Recordings delivers the Gospel to illiterate people in Africa, South America, Asia, Australia, and Central America via hand-operated record players.  As of 2008, the company has produced recordings in 5,705 languages.
Ridderhof and Gospel Recordings are the subjects of the 2006 P.O.V. documentary The Tailenders.

[[Sequential coupling]]
CATEGORIES: Anti-patterns

In object-oriented programming, sequential coupling refers to a class that requires its methods to be called in a particular sequence.  This may be an anti-pattern, depending on context.
Methods whose name starts with Init, Begin, Start, etc. may indicate the existence of sequential coupling.
Using a car as an analogy, if the user steps on the gas without first starting the engine, the car does not crash, fail, or throw an exception - it simply fails to accelerate.
Side Note:  Exceptions are acceptable some of the time because programs (especially large ones) need the feedback to determine why an object is not performing the expected behavior when one of its methods is called.  Object initialization is not always possible at construction and may need to be delayed to a later time.  The programmer using a class may not be the same programmer who wrote it.
Sequential coupling can be refactored with the Template method pattern to overcome the problems posed by the usage of this anti-pattern.[tpl]cite web|last=Andriy|first=Buday|title=Refactor: Sequential Coupling => Template Method|url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/72734/Refactor-Sequential-Coupling-equals-Template-Metho.aspx|publisher=The Code Project|accessdate=23 April 2011[/tpl]

From there she conducted her only war patrol in the waters off Norway, in the North Sea and towards the Arctic Circle, but found no enemy ships to target, returning to Bergen without firing a shot. She did however manage to recover two Norwegian airmen of the British Royal Air Force, whose Mosquito aircraft had been shot down by [tpl]GS|U-804||2[/tpl] two days before they were rescued from the sea.
On the 9 August, U-1000 was detailed to serve in the Baltic Sea against Soviet shipping, which was beginning to press into German waters as the Red Army advanced on land.

Herbert Hudson Taylor (3 April 1861 – 6 June 1950), British Protestant Christian missionary to China, author, speaker and eldest son of James Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission and Maria Jane Dyer. He served there for over 50 years – the last three as one of the prisoners of the Japanese at the Weifang internment camp during World War II along with Eric Liddell and 1500 others.
Herbert Taylor was four when his father founded the China Inland Mission. He had been born in London during his parents’ first furlough in England together. At the time of his birth, they were living with his aunt and uncle Amelia and Benjamin Broomhall at 63 Westbourne Grove, in Bayswater. In 1866 at the age of five Herbert and his parents, three siblings and sixteen other missionaries sailed to China aboard the Lammermuir (clipper) as part of the famous Lammermuir Party. During the four-month long voyage the ship was nearly wrecked by two typhoons.
On arrival in China, the family adopted Chinese clothing and food and set off to find a place to establish a mission cente in Zhejiang. On the way, Herbert almost drowned when he fell overboard into the Grand Canal of China during their travels. Another scare happened shortly afterward when he was bitten by a dog on the face. His sister, Grace Dyer Taylor died of meningitis near Hangzhou within the first year. When he was six the family was nearly killed by a rioting mob during the Yangzhou riot in 1868. Finally in 1870 he was sent home with his surviving siblings with Emily Blatchley to live in London, separated from his parents. His mother died in China soon after they arrived home.
Like his father, he enrolled in the Royal London Hospital medical college. After two years he decided to return to China to become one of the charter teachers at the newly founded China Inland Mission Chefoo School at (Yantai). After marrying a fellow missionary, Jeanie Gray, they endured tumultuous years in China, including the Boxer Rebellion, the fall of the Qing dynasty, the Warlord era, and the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937).
In 1930 the China Inland Mission published “Ren Ch'eng-Yüan, A Tamarisk Garden Blessed with Rain. Or the Autobiography of Pastor Ren. Translated and edited by Herbert Hudson Taylor & Marshall Broomhall.”
At the age of 80 he was interned by the Japanese at the Weihsien or Weifang concentration camp after Japan had entered the war in 1941. Everyone at Weifang were liberated in 1945 by American paratroopers.
Descendants of Herbert Hudson Taylor continued his full-time ministry today in the communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Grandson, the late Rev. James Hudson Taylor III (1929–2009) and his son Rev. James Hudson Taylor IV in Taiwan.
Another of Herbert Taylor’s grandchildren is Mary Previte who served in the New Jersey General Assembly representing the 6th legislative district from 1998 to 2006.

The Synthetic Fuels Corporation was a U.S. government-funded corporation established in 1980 by the Synthetic Fuels Corporation Act to create a financial bridge for the development and construction of commercial synthetic fuel manufacturing plants (such as coal gasification) that would produce alternatives to imported fossil fuels. The Great Plains coal gasification plant in Beulah, ND, still producing natural gas and sequestering carbon in 2009,dakotagas.com, DOE receives $57 million payment from clean coal plant was built with the support of the Department of Energy and applied for further support by this corporation, partly as a result of efforts by Reagan's Energy Secretary James B.

The original intention of the corporation[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] was to partner with industry (primarily oil and gas companies) to create a market for domestically-produced synthetic liquid fuels, with a goal of producing [tpl]convert|2|Moilbbl|m3[/tpl] of liquid fuel per day within five years. Critics of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation [tpl]Who|date=November 2009[/tpl] point to its failure to achieve its goals [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] as a reason to prevent government from interfering with free markets. The purported objective behind the Synthetic Fuels Corporation [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] was to move research and development of synthetic fuels out of the Department of Energy and into a public-private partnership that would produce tangible results in a short period of time.  Many believe[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=August 2009[/tpl] that the drop in worldwide oil prices in the early 1980s played a primary role in obviating the need for the corporation, at least from a short-term economic perspective.

[[Treaties between Rome and Carthage]]
CATEGORIES: Punic Wars, Treaties of the Roman Republic, Treaties of Carthage

The treaties between Rome and Carthage are the four treaties between the two states that were signed between 509 BC and 279 BC. The treaties influenced the course of history in the Mediterranean, and are important for understanding the relationship between the two most important cities of the region during that era. They reveal changes in how Rome perceived itself and how Carthage perceived Rome, and the differences between the perception of the cities and their actual characteristics.
As city-states that became empires, Rome and Carthage eventually found it necessary to formalise their reciprocal interests and zones of influence. For centuries, the two operated side by side, even as allies. Their economic interests and methods of expansion were different: Rome did not look to the sea, engaged first in defending itself against the neighbouring Samnites, Etruscans, Gauls, and Greeks, and then in conquering them; Carthage, lacking a real civic army and repelled in Sicily by the Greeks, appeared indecisive regarding its expansion strategy: while the aristocratic party was inclined to extend the power of the city into surrounding lands, the commercial party was more interested in exploiting trade routes and markets. By stipulating and observing four main treaties, the relationship between Rome and Carthage was one of tolerance for centuries. Carthage and Rome also concluded two treaties to end the First and Second Punic War in 241 BC and 201 BC, by which time the relationship between the powers had changed considerably.

Pedro Almíndez Chirino (or Pedro Almíndez Chirinos) was a conquistador born in Úbeda and member of several councils that governed New Spain while Hernán Cortés was traveling to Honduras, in 1525-26. Almíndez was an ally of Gonzalo de Salazar; the events of this period are recounted in that article.
In 1530 he was sent by Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán to the current Mexican states of Jalisco, Aguascalientes, Zacatecas and Sinaloa to explore the region, search for gold and silver, and subdue the Indians. He passed through the current town of Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco in March 1530 with a force of 50 Spanish soldiers and 500 Tarascan and Tlaxcaltec allies. This encounter was peaceful, but he was accused of a massacre in Morocito (Sinaloa) in 1531, and in many places of destroying and burning everything he passed. "Mocorito" in the Cahita language signifies the place of the dead. The indigenous people named it for the Indians that Pedro Almindez Chirino killed.

Breakaway music is a modern U.S. Naval tradition used to motivate sailors upon the conclusion of underway replenishment UNREP, although using breakaway music is at the discretion of the Captain, and not all commands use it. When the two ships involved in the UNREP conclude their transfer of fuels and stores and commence their breakaway, a song (usually selected by the Captain, but sometimes picked by the OOD or Navigation Officer) is played over the 1MC.  Breakaway music may sometimes be related to the name of the ship, such as the "Theme from Star Trek" (USS Enterprise) or "Kansas City Lights" (USS Kansas City).

Hick and Sons). Temple Works is the only Grade I listed building in Holbeck.
Temple Works, also known as Temple Mill, comprises an office block and factory, the office block based on the temple at Antaeopolis and Temple of Horus at Edfu with a chimney designed in the style of an obelisk; the factory building derived from the Typhonium at Dendera. Hick's engine was modelled with Egyptian details including a regulator in the form of a winged solar disk.[tpl]cite book|last=Stevens Curl|first=James|title=The Egyptian Revival|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134234686|page=279|pages=|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OcU7YPeE5yoC&pg=PA279&lpg=PA279&dq=benjamin+hick+temple+mill&source=bl&ots=1ybqvueJzp&sig=N0y1QbULIXrRhuJqi-ETxpIW590&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NHrOUv-fDYHK4ASvkYGgAg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=benjamin%20hick%20temple%20mill&f=false[/tpl]
Marshall's inspiration for the design of Temple Works was his interest in Egyptology. When it was built it was said that Temple Works was the biggest single room in the world. An unusual feature of the Temple Works building is that sheep used to graze on the grass-covered roof. This served the purpose of retaining humidity in the flax mill to prevent the linen thread from becoming dried out and unmanageable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/news/temple-mill-leeds/|title=Temple Mill, Leeds|publisher=The Victorian Society|accessdate=27 October 2012[/tpl]
The mill was caught up in the Plug Riots of August 1842.  The Leeds Annals Mayhall, The Annals and History of Leeds and other places in the County of York, Leeds 1860, page 484 described the events at the mill:
“The vicinity of the new mill in Marshall Street was completely crammed with an excited mob, many of whom were armed with bludgeons, stones &c.  The yard-door leading to the boilers of the new mill was strongly defended by Mr J. G. Marshall, and a number of workmen; but the mob by repeated efforts forced down the door, and rushed into the yard.  They could not find the plug of the boiler, and consequently did not succeed in stopping the mill.  They left the premises without having done any serious mischief, and then proceeded to the mill of Messrs. Titley, Tatham and Walker, Water Lane, which they were engaged in stopping when Prince George with the Lancers came up at full speed and formed in a line in Camp Field.  The riot act was read, and two or three of the ringleaders were taken prisoners … .”
A planning application dated July 2005 proposed to partly demolish, refurbish, and extend the mill to form a retail centre, offices, cafes, 75 flats and parking. On 8 December 2008 a stone pillar in the mill's facade collapsed. A slab of millstone grit fell onto the pavement in Marshall Street and the roof parapet above the pillar bowed out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/7771987.stm|title=Pillar collapses at historic mill |date=8 December 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Historic-Leeds-building-collapses.4770420.jp|title=Historic Leeds building collapses|last=Smith|first=Bruce|date=8 December 2008|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=11 December 2008|format= with video[/tpl] English Heritage advised on a strategy for repairs; their spokesman said that the building was "probably the finest example of a carved stone elevation in the whole region."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/39Egyptian-temple39-in-Leeds-shored.4777389.jp|title='Egyptian temple' in Leeds shored up as owners take advice|date=10 December 2008|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|last=Marsh | first=David|accessdate=11 December 2008[/tpl]

Oxford University Press. Retrieved 9 November 2013|group= n[/tpl] was a wealthy Athenian citizen who assumed the public duty, or choregiai, of financing the preparation for the chorus and other aspects of dramatic production that were not paid for by the government of the polis or city-state.Brockett, p. 17 Modern Anglicized forms of the word include choragus and choregus, with the accepted plurals of choregi and choragi In modern Greek the word χορηγός is synonymous with the word "grantor".Pring, p. 214
Choregoi were appointed by the archon and the tribes of Athenian citizens from among the Athenian citizens of great wealth. Service as a choregos, though an honor, was a duty for wealthy citizens and was part of the liturgical system designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good.  Choregoi paid for costumes, rehearsals, expenses of the chorus (including training, salaries, board and lodging), scenery, props (including elaborate masks), special effects and most of the musicians.  The choregos also hosted a feast if his chorus proved victorious in competition. The prizes for drama at the Athenian festival competitions were awarded jointly to the playwright and the choregos. Such victories carried prestige for the choregos. Several notable political figures served as choregoi, including Themistocles, Pericles and Plato, among others.  Monuments were built in honor of victorious choregoi.
At the turn of the 17th century AD, in an attempt to recreate the ancient Greek dramatic tradition, the position was revived briefly in Italian opera, and combined the roles of impresario and director.

Kasper Mansker (1750–1820) was a longhunter and one of middle Tennessee's first European explorers and settlers.[tpl]cite web|last=West|first=Carroll Van|title=Kasper Mansker|url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=830|work=Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture[/tpl] He was born of German parents on a ship bound for the new world about 1750. His parents settled in America, but due to poor recordkeeping there are vague and conflicting reports about exactly where they lived. He probably lived in the mid-Atlantic region. Various reports include mentions of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and possibly what is now West Virginia. However, Mansker was a true frontiersman and soon left Virginia to explore the vast lands to the west. It is also known that Mansker married an Elizabeth White of Berkeley County, West Virginia, but there is no known record of the marriage, so details of the actual date and location are also sketchy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Durham|first=Walter|title=Kasper Mansker: Cumberland Frontiersman|journal=Tennessee Historical Quarterly|date=Summer 1971|volume=30|issue=2|pages=154–77|url=http://www.mansker.org/history/durham.htm|accessdate=13 August 2012[/tpl] In his will a brother George is also mentioned as well as his brother's sons.
In 1769, Mansker departed on his first hunting trip into the vast western territory. He explored and hunted extensively along the Cumberland River in middle Tennessee and Kentucky. He spent most of his adult life exploring, hunting and living in the areas of what are now Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Mississippi. His first trip was filled with adventures of the hunt, survival, and his party was robbed of some of its supplies by a small band of Indians. In contrast, the French fur traders they met were friendly and his hunting party was able to trade for fresh food and alcohol.
In 1771, Mansker made a second trip into the areas of Kentucky and Tennessee with Col. John Montgomery. This trip was marred by the disappearance of two members of their party who had remained at the camp in Kentucky while additional supplies were being acquired. He eventually set up camp along the Cumberland River in Sumner County, Tennessee. There was an ample supply of game and fertile valleys. Once again Indians attacked their camp and plundered supplies and took about 500 deer skins. These were eventually replaced, but in 1772, an ideal hunting area was identified by Mansker containing two salt licks located close to each other. Hunting was excellent, and Mansker eventually built a fort for himself and his neighbors at this site, near what is now Goodlettsville, Tennessee, in 1780. The fort was an important stopping place for settlers who arrived in middle Tennessee during the late 18th century until the early 19th century.
In 1773, Mansker returned to his home to Virginia, and his name appears in court documents as serving jury duty and appearing as a witness in a separate case. His stay in Virginia was brief, because by 1775, he returned to middle Tennessee to the vicinity of Mansker's Lick. It was during this trip that he explored the section of the Cumberland River near the Red River with John Montgomery at the site of modern Clarksville, Tennessee.
The years of the American Revolutionary War are quiet concerning Mansker, but in 1779 he joined Captain James Robertson's party that was looking for suitable territory to establish a settlement. The area they met was called French Lick, the site of what is now Nashville, Tennessee.
In early 1780, Mansker moved further north and established his own fort at Goodlettsville. He was also a signer the Cumberland Compact, an agreement providing guidelines for the forming of government in the developing Cumberland region. The compact established the Cumberland Association, a governing body for the region made up of representatives from the various forts, about seven, in the vicinity of Nashville. Mansker's fort is one of the forts that was designated for representation.
Soon the Indians realized that the constant push of settlers was unending. The primary concern was the invasion of lands that were recognized among the various Indian tribes as hunting lands. So, the arrival of settlers into this preferred hunting grounds was seen as unacceptable. The result was a series of frequent attacks by the native Indians against settlers in the region. Due to his skill and experience in this area, Mansker's fort was considered to be one of the safest areas in the region. He set up accommodations at the fort and is regarded as one of the earliest innkeepers in the Cumberland settlements.
In the spring of 1781, Mansker became a victim of an Indian attack, and was listed as wounded in the skirmish. This is the only record of him being injured due to conflict with the local Indian tribes.

[[Zoxea]]

CATEGORIES: 1974 births, Living people, People from Sèvres, French rappers, French people of Beninese descent

Jean-Jacques Kodjo, a.k.a. Zoxea, was born on November 11, 1974 in Sèvres, Hauts-de-Seine. He was brought up in the Castéja Project of Boulogne-Billancourt in the suburb of Paris.
He is one of the three members of Les Sages Poètes de la Rue (The Wise Poets of the Street) with his brother Melopheelo and Dany Dan. They made their first apparition on the hip-hop scene in 1993 on the Cool Sessions compilation and on the original soundtrack of the classic La Haine with on Baiser du Poste (With love from the Police station).
Les Sages Poètes de la Rue released their first album Qu’est ce qui fait marcher les Sages (What makes the wise guys walk) in 1995. Far from the hardcore trend, Zoxea and his mates prefer an old-school approach on jazzy vibes.
With the success of this first album, Zoxea and Les Sages Po’ form their own structure: Beat de Boul, in order to help the groups of their area to make it into the hip hop industry. Amongst these groups are the famous Lunatic, Malekal Morte, Movez’ Lang and Less du Neuf. Beat de Boul releases Dans la Sono (In the Soundsystem) in 1997 and les Sages Po’ come back the following year 1998 with their second album Jusqu’à l’Amour (Till Love) and are acclaimed by both their public and the media.
Zoxea takes advantage of this success to launch his solo career. He collaborates with Busta Flex on his eponymous album where he produces the hit J’fais mon job à plein temps (I do my job full-time), and he takes part to the Freestyle Sessions with NTM (Joey Starr and Kool Shen). He also supports them on stage during the national tour 93 Party and produces On est encore là (We’re still there) a track on their eponymous album. Finally he creates the crew IV My People with Kool Shen and Busta Flex.
In February 1999, Zoxea releases his first album solo : À mon tour d’briller (It’s my turn to shine). The album goes gold by the end of the same year and show the talent of Zoxea as a solo artist with great featuring such as Beat de Boul, Don Choa, Lord Kossity, Melopheelo and Kool Shen.
In 2000, Zoxea takes part to the second episode of Beat de Boul: Dans la Ville (In the City), with Melopheelo and Dany Dan but also Movez’ Lang, Nysay and Sir Doum’s.
Les Sages Poètes de la Rue make it back to the studio in 2002 for their third album Après l’Orage (After the Storm). Après l’Orage proves that Zoxea, Melopheelo and Dany Dan still have the magic of their glorious beginning.
In 2003, Zoxea and his brother Melopheelo form their own label: KDBZik, to preserve their independent spirit. In 2004, they release Zoxea’s second album solo: Dans la Lumière (In the Light). The same year, Zoxea realises the hit Un Ange dans le Ciel (An Angel in the Sky) and appears on two tracks of Dernier Round (Last Round) the solo album of Kool Shen.
The following year sees the release of the fourth album of Les Sages Poètes de la Rue: Trésors Enfouis (Hidden Treasures). The public still loyal to the band welcomes this album “concept”.
In 2006, Zoxea appears in featuring with the R&B phenomenon M. Pokora on l’Enfer du Samedi Soir (Saturday Night Hell). The following year, Zoxea comes back with Beat de Boul and its third episode: Dans un Autre Monde (In Another World).
Zoxea has been an artist resident at the CENTQUATRE, a Parisian place of artistic creation, from February to October 2009 to work on his third solo album http://www.104.fr/#en/Artists/A120-Zoxea.
Zoxea is also planning to go back to the recording studio with Les Sages Poètes de la Rue to work on their fifth album, which will be another occasion to bring their peaceful and jazzy touch to the hip-hop.

The Parry Sound Colonization Railway Company (PSCR) is a historic Canadian railway that operated in Ontario. It originally intended to connect to the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway but ran out of funds shortly after starting construction and making it only part way to Parry Sound. The line was purchased by John Rudolphus Booth  in 1892 to form the western end of his Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway. Failing to come to an agreement on the location of an associated port, the line ultimately bypassed the town completely, running to Depot Harbour, a company town.

Stephen de Pa († 1386) was Prior and, briefly, Bishop-elect of St. Andrews. He was elected to succeed William de Landallis after the latter's death on 23 September 1385. He was never consecrated, because while on his way to continental Europe  to receive confirmation and consecration by the Pope, carrying a commendation from King Robert II of Scotland and a decree of the election, he was captured by English pirates. He was kept prisoner in England while his captors demanded a ransom. Stephen however did not want his church burdened with such a payment, and chose to remain in that country. Moreover, he had caught ill soon after his capture, and died at Alnwick on 2 March 1386.

"(The Same Thing Happens with) The Birds and the Bees" is a popular song, written by Harry Warren (music) and Mack David (lyrics) and published in 1956. It was written for the musical film, The Birds and the Bees (where it was performed by George Gobel and Mitzi Gaynor) and has been recorded by a number of singers, including Barbara Lyon.
Alma Cogan had a #25 hit with this song in the UK: as her 1956 version credited the song as "The Birds and the Bees" and was the flip side of a cover of "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" (#22) it's often misreported that Alma's hit was a cover of Jewel Akens' #3 United States hit "The Birds and the Bees".

[[ICW World Heavyweight Championship]]

CATEGORIES: International Championship Wrestling championships, World heavyweight wrestling championships

The ICW World Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship of International Championship Wrestling. Many title defenses featured matches between Randy Savage and his real-life brother Lanny Poffo.
After the original ICW shut down in 1984, Paul Christy started his own ICW promotion.
The title history in 1979 is not clear. It is possible that Randy Savage won the title in July rather than on March 13. In addition, one source does not recognize the title changes between Savage and Poffo between this reign and 1982, as it claims that Savage won the title in 1979 and held it for over four years before dropping it to Christy.

It was established in 1876 as the first experimental corn field at an American college and continues to be used today, although with three plots instead of the original ten.Illinois Farm Bureau "An Urbana Legend" Partners magazine (Spring 2009) 
The results of the experiments which were carried out at the Morrow Plots showed that "soil quality is a vital component of agricultural productivity", and that the "use of science and technology ... increased crop productivity over four-fold."
The site was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 23, 1968.National Park Service, National Historic Landmark Program. Morrow Plots, University of Illinois. May 1, 2007.
It is popularly believed that the University constructed its Undergraduate Library to the west of the Plots with three stories underground, so that the library would not block the sun from the Morrow Plots. However, the University master plan at the time called for a large open plaza on that end of campus, which was an equally important reason the library was built underground."Morrow Plots" at UIHistories Project.

[[Potoroo]]

CATEGORIES: Potoroids, Marsupials of Australia

The potoroo is a kangaroo-like marsupial about the size of a rabbit. It is a macropod. All three extant species are threatened, especially the long-footed Potoroo (Endangered) and Gilbert's potoroo (Critically Endangered). The main threats are predation by introduced species (especially foxes) and habitat loss.
Potoroos were formerly very common, and early settlers reported them as being a significant pest to their crops.
Gilbert's Potoroo is Australia's most endangered animal. There are only 30–40 known left in the wild. It was discovered in 1840 by a naturalist called John Gilbert. It was then thought to have become extinct until being rediscovered in 1994 at the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve (near Albany) in Western Australia.

The life expectancy of a cat is typically 12–15 years. However, some cats that are kept indoors may attain the age of 21 years or more."What is the life span of the common cat?", About.com. By comparison, the average life expectancy of humans at birth is 67.2 years.CIA - The World Factbook -- Rank Order - Life expectancy of humans at birth. A one-year-old cat is roughly comparable, in developmental terms, to a 15-year-old-human.

The table below shows the correspondence between a cat's chronological age and the age of a human at a comparable stage of development.

[[Cross-bedding]]

CATEGORIES: Geology, Sedimentary rocks, Sedimentology, Cross-bedding

In geology, the sedimentary structures known as cross-bedding refer to (near-) horizontal units that are internally composed of inclined layers. This is a case in geology in which the original depositional layering is tilted, and the tilting is not a result of post-depositional deformation. Cross-beds or "sets" are the groups of inclined layers, and the inclined layers are known as cross strata. 
Cross bedding forms during deposition on the inclined surfaces of bedforms such as ripples and dunes, and indicates that the depositional environment contained a flowing medium (typically water or wind). Examples of these bedforms are ripples, dunes, anti-dunes, sand waves, hummocks, bars, and delta slopes.Collinson, J.D., Thompson, D.B., 1989, Sedimentary Structures (2nd ed): Academic Division of Unwin Hyman Ltd, Winchester, MA, XXX p. Cross-bedding is widespread in many environments. Environments in which water movement is fast enough and deep enough to develop large-scale bed forms fall into three natural groupings: rivers, tide-dominated coastal and marine settings.Ashley, G.

Scottish Backhold is a style of folk wrestling originating in Scotland.  The wrestlers grip each other around the waist at the back, with the right hand under the opponent's left arm and the chin resting on the opposite right shoulder.  When the referee is sure that both wrestlers have taken a firm grip, he shouts "hold" and the bout starts.  Should either wrestler break his hold or touch the ground with any part of his body except his feet, he loses.  There is no ground work and the bouts are usually best of five falls. The rules may be found on the website of the Scottish Wrestling Bond. Gardar Vilhjálmsson from Iceland is currently the greatest backhold wrestler of all time. Currently, Frazer Hirsch ( reigning European Champion ), runs Scotland's brightest and most prosperous club - Carnoustie Backhold Wrestling Club. Among their members, young 20 year old, Ryan Dolan, is expected to make a serious challenge for the Euro Junior title, taking place in Leon, Spain, 2014.

Strategic intelligence (STRATINT) pertains to the collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence that is required for forming policy and military plans at the national and international level.  Most but not all of the information needed for strategic reflections comes from Open Source Intelligence.Herman, Michael. Intelligence Power in Peace and War ISBN 0-521-56636-3.
Strategic intelligence pertains to the following system of abilities that, according to Michael Maccoby, characterize some of the most successful leaders in business and government:[ref]Michael Maccoby,Successful Leaders Employ Strategic Intelligence, Research Technology Management, Volume 44. No. 3. May–June, 2001. pp . 58-60. The Productive Narcissist, Broadway Books, 2003, chapter 4.

Recent thought leadership on strategic intelligence focuses on the consequences of the modern information age, which has led to the availability of substantial volumes of information than previously encountered.  Alfred Rolington, the former CEO of Jane’s Information Group and Oxford Analytica, recommends that intelligence organizations approach the challenges of the modern information age by breaking from their traditional models to become more deeply and continuously inter-linked.Alfred Rolington.

The Subiaco Press was a printing press in Subiaco, Italy. The Press was established in 1464 by the German monks Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweinheim in the church of Santa Scolastica at Subiaco. It was the first printing press in Italy.
The first book printed at Subiaco was a Donatus; it has not been preserved. This was followed by Cicero's De Oratore in September 1465 (which is extant - a copy is in the Buchgewerbehaus at Leipzig).  The next book was Lactantius's De divinis institutionibus printed in October 1465. In 1467, Augustine's The City of God was printed. These early books are notable for their typography. Unlike earlier German books, they were not printed in blackletter type. Instead, they were printed in a "half Roman" type, as in Italy there was a desire to use Roman characters.  Furthermore, Lactantius's De divinis institutionibus  contains the world's first Greek printed characters. These were used for the extensive quotations in Greek which employed mobile letters now called "Subiaco type."
In 1467, Pannartz and Sweinheim left Subiaco and settled in Rome.

[[Graded bedding]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentology

In geology, a graded bed is one characterized by a systematic change in grain or clast size from the base of the bed to the top. Most commonly this takes the form of normal grading, with coarser sediments at the base, which grade upward into progressively finer ones.  Normally graded beds generally represent depositional environments which decrease in transport energy as time passes, but also form during rapid depositional events.   They are   perhaps best represented in turbidite strata, where they indicate a sudden strong current that deposits heavy, coarse sediments first, with finer ones following as the current weakens.  They can also form in terrestrial stream deposits.

[[Compadre]]
CATEGORIES: Latin American culture, Baptism

The compadre ([tpl]IPA-es|komˈpaðɾe|lang[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|kũˈpaðɾɨ|lang[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|kõˈpadɾi|[/tpl], literally "co-father" or "co-parent") relationship between the parents and godparents of a child is an important bond that originates when a child is baptized in Iberian and Latin American families. The abstract noun compadrazgo (Spanish), compadrio (in Portuguese), both meaning "co-parenthood," is sometimes used to refer to the institutional relationship between  compadres."Counting on Kin: Social Networks, Social Support, and Child Health Status." Shawn Malia Kana'iaupuni, Katharine M Donato, Theresa Thompson-Colón, Melissa Stainback. Social Forces. Chapel Hill: Mar 2005.Vol.83, Iss. 3; pg. 1137, 28 pgs"Las Comadres as a social support system." Rebecca A Lopez. Affilia. Thousand Oaks: Spring 1999.Vol.14, Iss. 1; pg. 24, 18 pgs."The Forgotten Liberator: Buenaventura Martínez and Yucatán's Republican Restoration." Terry Rugeley. Mexican Studies. Berkeley: Summer 2003.Vol.19, Iss. 2; pg. 331
From the moment of a baptism ceremony, the godparents (godfather and godmother, padrino and madrina in Spanish or padrinho and madrinha in Portuguese) share the parenting role of the baptised child with the natural parents. By Catholic doctrine, upon the child's baptism the godparents accept the responsibility to ensure that the child is raised according to the dictates of the Catholic faith and to ensure the child pursues a life of improvement and success (through education, marriage, personal development, and so forth).
At the moment of baptism, the godparents and natural parents become each other's compadres (the plural form compadres includes both male and female co-parents). The female equivalent of compadre is comadre ([tpl]IPA-es|koˈmaðɾe|lang[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|kuˈmaðɾɨ|lang[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|kuˈmadɾi|[/tpl]). Thus, the child's father will call the child's godmother "comadre," while she will call him "compadre," and so on.
Traditionally among Iberians and Latin Americans, this relationship formalizes a pre-existing friendship which results in a strong lifelong bond between compadres. In its original form, the compadre relationship among the strongest types of family love soon after one's nuclear family. In many Latin American societies, lifelong friends or siblings who have always spoken to each other informally (using the informal Spanish second-person, tú) may mark their new compadre relationship by using respectful or formal speech (using the formal Spanish second-person, usted).
There are a number of other ritual occasions that are considered to result in a compadre relationship in various Latin American societies. These may include ritual sponsorship of other Catholic sacraments (first communion, confirmation, and marriage); sponsorship of a quinceañera celebration; and, in Peru, sponsorship of a ritual first haircut ceremony that normally takes place when a child turns three years old. 
Compadrazgo has its roots in mediaeval European Catholicism. The Doge of Venice Pietro II Orseolo worked all his life for creating solid contacts with the contemporary monarchs, achieving good relationships with the Byzantine Empire. On the other hand, he approximated to Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor and eventually named him literally with the title of compadre, which meant "the father of the Venecian Doge's children". Otto specially liked this, and became the children's godfather.Katus László: Németország történeti gyökerei. In: Rubicon, 1999 1-2, pp. 4-8
The classic Spanish novel Don Quixote (1605–1615) contains several references to compadres; however, the compadre relationship has much less formal meaning in modern Spain where it is a reference both to a godfather/padrino or just to a best friend, with no reference to any ritual. The expression is in use particularly in southern Spain. In medieval England, parents and godparents called each other "godsibs" (that is, "God siblings"). The only trace of this old Catholic English practice in modern English is the word gossip, presumably a reference to the propensity of close companions such as compadres to chat and gossip with one another. In Spanish, the verb comadrear (from comadre) similarly means "to gossip," as does the French cognate commérage (from commère).
The term compadre has been extended in some regions, such as Brazil to describe a common relationship between two good friends. In Argentina and Paraguay, the word is used in popular speech (especially in the diminutive, compadrito) to mean "braggart, loud-mouth, bully." However, among more traditional Latin American and Hispanic/Latino families, the word retains its original meaning and symbolism, and for its members, to be asked to be a padrino or compadre is a great, lifelong honor.

[[Essentially contested concept]]
CATEGORIES: Concepts in aesthetics, Philosophical concepts, Philosophy of religion, Rhetoric, Social concepts

In a paper delivered to the Aristotelian Society on 12 March 1956,Published immediately as Gallie (1956a); a later, slightly altered version appears in Gallie (1964). Walter Bryce Gallie (1912–1998) introduced the term essentially contested concept to facilitate an understanding of the different applications or interpretations of the sorts of abstract, qualitative, and evaluative notionsThey are "evaluative" in the sense that they deliver some sort of "value-judgement". — such as "art" and "social justice" — used in the domains of aesthetics, political philosophy, philosophy of history, and philosophy of religion.
Garver (1978) describes their use as follows:
Essentially contested concepts involve widespread agreement on a concept (e.g., "fairness"), but not on the best realization thereof.Hart (1961, p.156) speaks of "a uniform or constant feature", and "a shifting or varying criterion used in determining when, for any given purposes, cases are alike or different". 
They are "concepts the proper use of which inevitably involves endless disputes about their proper uses on the part of their users",Gallie (1956a), p.169. The dispute is about the proper use of the concept; and all argue that the concept is being "used inappropriately" by others (Smith, 2002, p.332). and these disputes "cannot be settled by appeal to empirical evidence, linguistic usage, or the canons of logic alone".Gray (1977), p.344.

Marshall's Mill is a former flax spinning mill on Marshall Street in Holbeck, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.
Marshall's Mill was part of a complex begun in 1791-92 by English industrial pioneer John Marshall. It was a six storey mill, drawing water from the nearby Hol Beck, with machines supplanting Yorkshire's previous cottage industry of hand driven spindles. Later, together with the adjacent Egyptian-style Temple Works, the complex employed over 2,000 factory workers. When it was completed it was considered to be one of the largest factories in the world, with 7,000 steam-powered spindles.
In the early years, child labour was employed. In 1832 Marshall's political opponents alleged that:
 
 'In Mr Marshall's mill, a boy of 9 years of age was stripped to the skin, bound to an iron pillar, and mercilessly beaten with straps, until he fainted.'Thompson, EP: "The Making of the English Working Class", page 906. Penguin, 1991.

But other reportsSpartacus Educational: Biography of John Marshall claim that Marshall treated his workers better than most factory owners: overseers were forbidden to use corporal punishment to control the workers, and Marshall installed fans and attempted to regulate the temperature of the mill.  In 1844, Marshall and a neighbouring engineering firm, Taylor, Wordsworth and Co broke new ground by organising an away weekend in Liverpool for their workers, a novelty which caused even the editor of the normally liberal Leeds MercuryLeeds Mercury, 31 August 1844 some concern:
 
 'Entirely approving of excursions for the working class, and with the kindest feelings towards the workmen of Messrs Marshall and Messrs Taylor and Wordsworth, we would express our earnest hope that the Sunday spent in Liverpool may not in any respect be spent in a manner unbecoming the day ... There are many excellent men among the above bodies of workmen, and great responsibility will rest upon them for the issue of this new and somewhat doubtful experiment, of a large body of people being away from home on the Sabbath, and on two whole nights.'

Marshall's Mill is now a grade II* listed building.
The site was comprehensively redeveloped in the late 1990s. It is now used as office space for several companies, including Orange. There are plans to further redevelop the site as part of Holbeck Urban Village.

[[Kalasha]]
CATEGORIES: Containers, Hindu symbols, Jain symbols, Pottery, Objects used in Hindu worship

Kalasha, also spelled as Kalash and kalasa (Sanskrit: [tpl]lang|sa|कलश[/tpl]; literally "pitcher, Kalasha pot"), is a metal (brass, copper, silver or gold) pot with a large base and small mouth, large enough to hold a coconut. Sometimes "Kalasha" also refers to such a pot filled with water and topped with a coronet of mango leaves and a coconut.  This combination is often used in Hindu rites and depicted in Hindu iconography. The entire arrangement is called Purna-Kalasha ([tpl]lang|sa|पूर्णकलश[/tpl]), Purna-Kumbha ([tpl]lang|sa|पूर्णकुम्भ[/tpl]), or Purna-ghata ([tpl]lang|sa|पूर्णघट[/tpl]).  Each of these names literally means "full or complete vessel" when the pot is referred to as the Kalasha (to avoid confusion, this article will refer to the pot as Kalasha and the entire arrangement as Purna-Kalasha). Sometimes the Kalasha is filled with coins, grain, gems, gold, or a combination of these items instead of water. The coronet of 5, 7, or 11 mango leaves is placed such that the tips of the leaves touch water in the Kalasha. The coconut is sometimes wrapped with a red cloth and red thread; the top of the coconut (called Shira – literally "head") is kept uncovered. A sacred thread is tied around the metal pot. The Shira is kept facing the sky.
The Kalasha is viewed as an auspicious object in Jainism. The Kalasha is used as a ceremonial object as well as a decorative motif in Indian art and architecture. The Kalasha motif was used in decorating bases and capitals of pillars from the 5th century.Students' Britannica India by Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani p. 183 Published 2000, Popular Prakashan, ISBN 0-85229-760-2

The chain begins with Lake Burton as the northernmost lake followed by Lake Seed, Lake Rabun, Lake Tallulah Falls, Lake Tugalo, and Lake Yonah.  The lakes are owned and operated by the Georgia Power Company to generate hydroelectric energy for Georgia's largest city, Atlanta.  At one time these lakes were the largest producers of electricity in the state of Georgia.  At present the lakes provide power only during periods of peak electricity consumption.

[[Safety instrumented system]]

CATEGORIES: Safety engineering, Risk

A Safety Instrumented System (SIS) consists of an engineered set of hardware and software controls which are especially used on critical process systems. A critical process system can be identified as one which, once running and an operational problem occurs, may need to be put into a "Safe State" to avoid adverse Safety, Health and Environmental(SH&E) consequences. Examples of critical processes have been common since the beginning of the Industrial Age. One of the more well known critical processes is the operation of a steam boiler. Critical parts of the process would include the lighting of the burners, controlling the level of water in the drum and controlling the steam pressure.
An SIS is engineered to perform "specific control functions" to failsafe or maintain safe operation of a process when unacceptable or dangerous conditions occur.  Safety Instrumented Systems must be independent from all other control systems that control the same equipment in order to ensure SIS functionality is not compromised. SIS is composed of the same types of control elements (including sensors,  logic solvers, actuators and other control equipment) as a Basic Process Control System (BPCS). However, all of the control elements in an SIS are dedicated solely to the proper functioning of the SIS.
The specific control functions performed by an SIS are called Safety Instrumented Functions (SIF). They are implemented as part of an overall risk reduction strategy which is intended to eliminate the likelihood of a, previously identified, SH&E event that could range from minor equipment damage up to an event involving an uncontrolled catastrophic release of energy and/or materials.
A Safe State is a process condition, whether the process is operating or shutdown, such that a hazardous SH&E event cannot occur.  The safe state must be achieved in a timely manner or within the "process safety time".
A formal process of hazard identification is performed by the project team engineers and other experts at the completion of the engineering design phase of each section of the process, known as a Unit of Operation. This team performs a systematic, rigorous, procedural review of each point of possible hazard, or "node", in the completed engineering design. This review and its resulting documentation is called a HAZOP study. Safety Integrity Levels (SIL) are defined for the SISs.  Based on HAZOP study recommendations and the SIL rating of the SISs; the engineering, the BPCS and the SISs designs, for each unit operation, can be finalized.
The correct operation of an SIS requires a series of equipment to function properly.  It must have sensors capable of detecting abnormal operating conditions, such as high flow, low level, or incorrect valve positioning. A logic solver is required to receive the sensor input signal(s), make appropriate decisions based on the nature of the signal(s), and change its outputs according to user-defined logic. The logic solver may use electrical, electronic or programmable electronic equipment, such as relays, trip amplifiers, or programmable logic controllers. Next, the change of the logic solver output(s) results in the final element(s) taking action on the process (e.g. closing a valve) to bring it to a safe state. Support systems, such as power, instrument air, and communications, are generally required for SIS operation. The support systems should be designed to provide the required integrity and reliability.
International standard IEC 61511 was published in 2003 to provide guidance to end-users on the application of Safety Instrumented Systems in the process industries. This standard is based on IEC 61508, a generic standard for design, construction, and operation of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic systems. Other industry sectors may also have standards that are based on IEC 61508, such as IEC 62061 (machinery systems), IEC 62425 (for railway signaling systems), IEC 61513 (for nuclear systems), and ISO 26262 (for road vehicles, currently a draft international standard).

CATEGORIES: Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland 1971, Politics of Northern Ireland

The Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 was an Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, passed in 1971 to replace the previous system of local authorities established  by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. The system was based on the recommendations of the Macrory Report, of June 1970, which presupposed the continued existence of the Government of Northern Ireland to act as a regional-level authority. 
Northern Ireland was to be divided into twenty-six local government districts, each consisting of a number of wards. The Act did not define the Districts exactly, but provided a list of 26 existing local government areas which would form the basis of the pattern.  It then gave the Governor of Northern Ireland the power to appoint a Local Government Boundaries Commissioner who was to report with proposed names and boundaries not later than 30 June 1972.
The Commissioner's proposals were put into effect by the Local Government (Boundaries) Order (Northern Ireland) 1972, dated 17 July 1972.Belfast Gazette, 28 July 1972 No.2800 p.288
The 1971 Act created districts, but did not make provision for councils to govern them. This was done by the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972. The councils created by the latter Act came into existence on 1 October 1973.

[[Cyathea cuspidata]]
CATEGORIES: Cyathea, Fern species, Flora of Central America

Cyathea cuspidata is a widespread species of tree fern native to Central and South America, where it grows in tropical rain forest up to the montane zone, as well as in open sites, on riverbanks and cleared pastureland at an altitude of 0-800 m. Its natural distribution covers Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, the Amazon Basin, Brazil and French Guiana. This species often has multiple trunks, which may be 15 m tall and about 10 cm in diameter. They are covered in black spines and together form a medium-sized, feathery clump. Fronds are bipinnate and 2-3 m long. The rachis and stipe are brown to dark brown and are covered with scales. The scales are bicoloured, having a dark brown to blackish centre and a pale, whitish margin. Pinnule veins sometimes have small, brown, star-shaped scales. Sori are round and form on either side of the pinnule midvein. They are covered by globose indusia.
In cultivation, C. cuspidata should be provided with high humidity and warm temperatures. It should not be exposed to frost.

CATEGORIES: Sport societies in the Soviet Union, Multi-sport clubs in the Soviet Union

Voluntary Sports Societies (VSS) of the USSR ([tpl]lang-ru|Добровольные спортивные общества (ДСО) СССР, Dobrobolvolnye Sportivye Obshestva SSSR (DSO SSSR)[/tpl]) were the main structural parts of the universal sports and physical education (fitness) system, that existed in the USSR between 1935 and 1991, together with already well established Dinamo, society in cooperation with Army, Aviation, and Fleet (DOSAAF), and CSKA sports societies.
VSS united working people and students going in for sports, physical culture, hiking, mountaineering, boating, and various other sports. The societies provided a sponsorship for various sport events and often existed on the volunteer donations from the workers of the certain industry with which they were associated. Their goals were to develop mass physical culture and sports and to provide facilities and conditions for sports training and improvement in athletes' skills. Most of the VSS were governed by trade Unions and often were closely associated with a certain ministry. Twenty five million athletes were members of such societies in 1970.
One of the most important features of VSS were Children and Youth Sport Schools ([tpl]lang-ru|Детско-юношеские спортивные школы, ДЮСШ[/tpl]), which numbered 1,350 in the 1970s and 7,500 in 1987. Later some of them were reformed into more elite Olympic reserve schools. There were also specialized sport clubs, groups of improvement athletes' skills, etc. More than 50,000 trainers and instructors worked there in these institutions.

[[Oriole Beach, Florida]]

CATEGORIES: Unincorporated communities in Santa Rosa County, Florida, Beaches of Florida, Pensacola metropolitan area, Unincorporated communities in Florida, Census-designated places in Florida

Oriole Beach is an unincorporated community located in Santa Rosa County, Florida on Santa Rosa Sound. It lies east of Gulf Breeze, Florida along Santa Rosa Sound on the Fairpoint Peninsula. Oriole Beach is part of the Pensacola–Ferry Pass–Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The main access road is U.S. Route 98, which runs east to west along the peninsula. The community has its roots as a beach cottage fishing retreat for the residents of Pensacola.  Today, some of the original cement block beach cottages remain standing.  They have survived many hurricanes.
About three miles south of Oriole Beach across Santa Rosa Sound is Pensacola Beach.
The community became more defined as permanent residents built homes mostly along Bay Street which runs along Santa Rosa Sound.  Santa Rosa Sound carries the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway between Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach. Present day Bay Street follows an old Indian trail and subsequent logging road used to harvest naval live oak trees for the construction of civil war sailing ships by the Union Navy in the 1860s.  The logging road connected to the Andrew Jackson Trail which linked Pensacola with Jacksonville, Florida.  Highway 98's current route along the Fairpoint Peninsula follows the Andrew Jackson Trail.
As the naval live oaks were harvested, the cleared land was then planted and used as cow pastures. Sections of the pasture land along the shoreline of Santa Rosa Sound was preserved and became part of the Mazzeo Estate on which some of the original naval live oak trees continue to grow today.  The logging trail was replaced by an oyster shell road bed, then surfaced by the State of Florida in the 1930s. Today, a part of that land has been acquired by the National Park Service and became the Naval Live Oaks Reservation, part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore.
In 1985 a homeowners' association was founded in Oriole Beach; it facilitated the construction of many improvements, including a new boat ramp and bicycle path. The bicycle path is part of the W.D. Childers trail that loops approximately 28 miles around Santa Rosa Sound. In 2007 land was purchased by Santa Rosa County to construct additional trailer parking at the boat ramp.
Since 1985 the population has explosively increased with many new subdivisions being built along with a new firehouse and police station.  The Oriole Beach Elementary school has also greatly expanded. The school is part of the Santa Rosa County School District which in 2006 was named the best performing school district in Florida, tied with its next door neighbor the Okaloosa County School District. The community developed mostly residential with a commercial strip along Highway 98.
Hurricane Ivan made landfall about 30 miles east of Oriole Beach in November 2004.  The tidal surge was recorded at 12 feet and the sustained winds were in excess of 120 miles per hour.  The Bay Street elevation of Oriole Beach is about 7.0 feet above mean sea level so some homes on grade were destroyed.
In February 2007 the Bay Street roadway was made three feet wider and about six inches higher by the Santa Rosa County Engineering Department.  New home construction is now required by the County Land Development Code to be connected to a sanitary sewer force main rather than septic tanks, the practice before Hurricane Ivan.  The City of Gulf Breeze supplies sanitary sewer and natural gas service to the community.  Potable water is supplied by a private water system from two elevated tanks connected to local water wells.
TThere have only been a handful of private docks rebuilt since Hurricane Ivan.  This is due in part to the very limited new construction of private homes coupled with a marked increase in ad valorum taxes and insurance rates that went into effect after Hurricane Ivan.
Due in part to escalating construction and insurance costs in the time since Hurricane Ivan only about 20 houses have been rebuilt along Bay Street. The houses are constructed on pilings in accordance with the revised county land development code.  The commercial strip along US 98 remained intact but economic development has become limited in the community.  One major shopping plaza remains abandoned and there remain many empty storefronts in the strip shopping centers along Highway 98.  An existing Wal-Mart in nearby Tiger Point experienced a decrease in growth.  Most of the community workforce commutes about 20 miles into Pensacola or a similar distance to Ft. Walton Beach or the Air Force base at Hurlburt Field. The Florida Department of Transportation has identified Highway 98 going through the community as a roadway to be expanded along with studies for a new Pensacola Bay Bridge.
No major tropical cyclones impacted Oriole Beach in 2006, and this allowed the community's flora to begin to reestablish itself.  Most of the hurricane debris has been removed by Santa Rosa County with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grant money.  As of Spring 2007, a few structures and pine trees damaged by Hurricane Ivan remain to be demolished and removed.

[[Isaiah 53]]

Isaiah 53, taken from the Book of Isaiah, is the last of the four Songs of the Suffering Servant, and tells the story of a "Man of Sorrows" or "God's Suffering Servant".  
Many Christians believe the "Man of Sorrows" or the "Suffering Servant" to be a reference to the prophecy of the Ministry of Jesus, which became a common theme in medieval and later Christian art. The passage of 'Isaiah 53' is known for its interpretation and use by Christian Theologians and Missionaries, many of whom identify the servant to be Christ Jesus. Many Christians view the entire chapter, and particularly this passage to refer to the Passion of Christ as well as the absolution of sins believed to be made possible by his sacrificial death.[tpl]cite web | title=Christian viewpoint 2 | work=grebeweb | url=http://www.grebeweb.com/linden/suffer.html | accessdate=2006-07-06[/tpl]

Jewish teaching also does take note of the historical context in which God's Suffering Servant appears, particularly because it speaks in the past tense. The  Jewish nation has borne unspeakable injustices, under Assyria, Babylonia, Ancient Greece, ancient Rome, Nazi Germany, which are all gone, and bears persecution and targeted mission to this day. Jewish scripture in Isaiah speaks in the light, when it says:

His work examines the impact of human activity on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. In St. Lucia and Saba in the Caribbean, he has studied the effects of marine reserves closed to all fishing. His studies revealed both the scale of human impacts on the sea, and the means of protecting marine ecosystems from such effects. He is now working to gain a wider acceptance for marine reserves, including in Britain and Europe where he is advising fishermen on how to promote the concept within the industry and to politicians.
Callum has served on a US National Research Council Committee on Marine Protected Areas and has also been a member of the Marine Reserves Working Group, headed up by Jane Lubchenco, Steve Gaines and Steve Palumbi at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara. With this group he sought to develop a more robust theoretical underpinning for the design and implementation of marine reserves.
In parallel with work on reserves, Callum has also been active with the Coral Reef Fish Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN). With colleagues, he has developed global maps of the biodiversity distribution of reef fishes and other faunal groups. These maps have revealed that marine species are more at risk of global extinction than previously believed. Many have small geographic ranges and life history characteristics that render them vulnerable to extinction. However, the maps also show ways to prioritise conservation investment into areas where those resources could be most effective.
He was awarded a Pew fellowship in marine conservation in 2000 to tackle obstacles to implementing marine reserves, and in 2001 he was awarded a Hardy fellowship in conservation biology at Harvard University.  Roberts is also an active supporter of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.

The Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar of Oddr Snorrason whose name is also sometimes Anglicized as Odd Snorrason was a Latin royal biography attributed to a 12th-century Icelandic Benedictine monk at the Þingeyrar monastery (Þingeyrarklaustur). 
The monastery was founded in 1133 and was the first in Iceland. Þingeyrarklaustur (Historical Places in Northwest Iceland)
Its subject is the  10th-century Norwegian king Óláfr Tryggvason.   The original work has been almost completely lost but a translation into Old Norse is preserved in two nearly complete versions and a fragment of a third. The work is often referred to as Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar. Oddr made use of previous written works including those of Sæmundr fróði and Ari Þorgilsson as well as Acta sanctorum in Selio and possibly Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium.Hoops 2003, p. 66. In turn Snorri Sturluson made use of Oddr's work when writing the Heimskringla, as did the author of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta.
It is difficult to tell how closely the Old Norse translation of Oddr's Óláfs saga resembles the Latin original but it clearly owes a debt to hagiography, presenting King Óláfr as the apostle to the Norwegians.Yngvars saga víðförla 
Yngvars saga víðförla also credits Oddr with its original authorship. Scholars have been skeptical towards this claim but in recent years it has gained more acceptance.Ross 2000, pp. 306-8; Oddr Snorrason 2003, p. 3.

All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger is the autobiography of Lloyd Kaufman, published by Berkely Boulevard, a subsidiary of Penguin Putnam, in 1998. Kaufman is the co-founder of B-movie company Troma Entertainment and the director of such films as The Toxic Avenger, Class of Nuke 'Em High, and Terror Firmer. The book was written by both Kaufman and screenwriter James Gunn; they had previously collaborated on the 1996 film Tromeo and Juliet. Gunn went on to more mainstream prominence as the writer of Dawn of the Dead (2004) and the writer-director of Slither (2006).
The book was written by Gunn after having numerous long interviews with Kaufman about his life. The book is written in a darkly humorous style, and is an unusual mish-mash of personal memories, how-to-make-movies advice, and pure flights of fantasy, such as the fictional ongoing struggles with the book's editor, Barry Neville.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Tromatized Interview with James Gunn - Horror Meets Comedy| publisher=Tromatized | date=2008-12-31 | url=http://tromatized.tromamovies.com/interviews/jamesgunn.htm  | accessdate=2009-02-02 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081011053704/http://tromatized.tromamovies.com/interviews/jamesgunn.htm | archivedate=2008-10-11[/tpl]

The academic boycott of South Africa comprised a series of boycotts of South African academic institutions and scholars initiated in the 1960s, at the request of the African National Congress, with the goal of using such international pressure to force the end to South Africa's system of apartheid.  The boycotts were part of a larger international campaign of "isolation" that eventually included political, economic, cultural and sports boycotts.  The academic boycotts ended in 1990, when its stated goal of ending apartheid was achieved.F.W. Lancaster & Lorraine Haricombe, The Academic Boycott of South Africa: Symbolic Gesture or Effective Agent of Change?, Perspectives on the Professions, Vol. 15, No. 1, Fall 1995, accessed 16 September 2006
During the apartheid era, the boycotts were debated within anti-apartheid circles as to whether they were ethically justified and appropriate.  Other critics of the boycott were various conservative groups worldwide who "disliked such anti-apartheid initiatives", and campus libertarians who "perceived a loss of academic freedom".Andy Beckett, It's water on stone - in the end the stone wears out, The Guardian, 12 December 2002, accessed 16 September 2006
Subsequent research in the post-apartheid area has claimed that the boycotts were more a "symbolic gesture of support" for anti-apartheid efforts rather than a direct influencer of the situation.  Additionally, the academic boycott was perceived by the targets of the boycott, South Africa scholars, as unjust and discriminatory.

Many more ritual prohibitions exist as well, which means that under limited circumstances a Jew has to self-sacrifice when the greater good calls for breaking a more minor dictate.[tpl]Clarify|date=August 2011[/tpl] This practice reflects the practical and malleable nature of Judaic law.

Vittoria Archilei (La Romanina) (fl. 1582 – 1620) was an Italian singer, dancer, and lutenist. She was born Vittoria Concarini, but in 1582 married Antonio Archilei, a composer and lutenist. She was in the service of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, along with Emilio de' Cavalieri, who was her mentor. In 1588 she went with her husband and Cavalieri to the Medici court in Florence, where she became "one of the most famous singers of her time" (Grove). She is recorded as singing at many court entertainments and weddings up until 1620, and was in the service of the Medici her whole career. Many composers wrote for her, including Sebastian Raval and Luca Marenzio, as well as, of course, her husband and Cavalieri.
Giulio Caccini and Jacopo Peri claimed that she had sung their music, in order to help their claims to supremacy in composition, as well as to being the best writers in the seconda prattica style. Sigismondo d'India also wrote of her skill in singing. She apparently sang in the new style, including many ornaments and passaggi. She sang with Francesca Caccini and Settimia Caccini in an imitation of the concerto delle donne in Florence for a period.

In 1880, with only a few copies privately printed, arrangements were made with noted actresses for a production the United Kingdom, but this never materialized. The first ever public performance was in New York in 1883 at the Union Square Theatre based on revisions made by Wilde while lecturing in America in 1882.

[[HP StorageWorks Scalable File Share]]

CATEGORIES: Hewlett-Packard products, Disk file systems, Shared disk file systems

HP StorageWorks Scalable File Share (HP SFS) is a production tested distributed parallel scalable filesystem designed to solve the I/O bandwidth challenge on large Linux clusters used in high-performance computing applications. It is based on the open source Lustre filesystem from Sun Microsystems. It is composed of software, hardware storage and service from HP.
HP SFS can be used over ethernet networks but it is more typical to use a high performance interconnect like Infiniband or Quadrics elan4, with many hundreds of compute clients connecting to each server cluster.
On the server side, HP SFS uses clustered pairs of HP Proliant servers (typically DL380) connected to either MSA20 SATA or EVA FibreChannel RAID storage arrays. Each pair member is the primary server of a set of Lustre services (MDS or OST) and backup server for the services provided by its partner. This configuration means that full filesystem service is guaranteed as long as at least one member of each server pair is up. If one server goes down its partner will automatically take over serving the OST or MDS services that were lost. Clients won't notice that anything has happened, except that they will experience a slight delay while a connection to the new server is established (Lustre recovery).
On the client side, HP provides a set of source rpms that can be used to build the kernel modules and supporting files required to connect clients running various Linux distros to an SFS server. They also provide precompiled binary rpms for the HP XC High Performance Computing Linux compute cluster distro.
The current version of HP SFS is V2.3 which is based on Lustre 1.4.11
A new version of SFS, based on Lustre 1.6 and codenamed SFS G3, was released in late 2008. This ships on different hardware configurations than the original SFS versions described above. A variant of G3 for the original SFS hardware platforms is due to ship in early 2009.

Stephen Brent Lowery (born October 12, 1960) is an American professional golfer. 
Lowery was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He has PGA Tour victories in 1994, 2000 and 2008. All three of his victories on the PGA Tour have come in playoffs. 
Lowery has been featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings. His best season on the PGA Tour was in 1994, when he finished 12th on the money list. He missed most of 2007 with a wrist injury. The PGA Tour granted him a partial exemption for the 2008 season. He needed to win more than $250,000 during his first eight starts in 2008 in order to re-gain his full exemption on the PGA Tour, but that became a moot point when he won the 2008 AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. The victory gave him a full two-year exemption. 
Lowery also won the Birmingham Golf Association Junior and State Junior in the late 70's, before embarking on his four years of college at the University of Alabama. He played for coach Conrad Rehling from 1979-1983, on the Alabama Crimson Tide golf team.
In 1998, Lowery was involved in a bizarre incident at The Players Championship, in which his successful approach shot to the infamous island green on the 17th hole was stolen by a seagull (which then dropped his ball into the adjacent water hazard).  Under PGA rules, Lowery was allowed to replace his ball with no penalty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usga.org/Rule-Books/Rules-of-Golf/Rule-18/|title=USGA - Rule 18|accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl]
Though it was in a losing effort, Lowery played a memorable stretch of golf at The International in 2002. He holed out a shot from over 200 yards for a rare albatross (or double eagle) on the 71st hole to pull within one point, ultimately losing by the same margin after missing a birdie putt on the last hole. Coming near the very end of the tournament and affecting such a close finish, Lowery's double eagle was one of the most dramatic in PGA Tour history since Gene Sarazen made a double eagle at 15 in the final round of The Masters in 1935. Two holes before his double eagle, Lowery also holed out a wedge from the fairway for an eagle .

Working for the Office of Naval Research (ONR) at the Naval Research Laboratory in the 1950s, Thaler developed an early warning system to detect the launching of ballistic missiles using high frequency radio waves bounced between the Earth's surface and the ionosphere, part of the upper atmosphere.
Monitoring the disruption of the returning radio waves, called back-scatter, allowed for the long distance detection of rocket launchings and nuclear tests. Based in the Washington D.C. area, the experimental monitoring systems, termed "over-the-horizon radar", were able to pick up radio disruptions from nuclear tests held in Nevada and were later successful in tracking a Polaris missile fired from Cape Canaveral.Pearce, Jeremy.

[[Cantalupo nel Sannio]]

CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in Molise

Cantalupo nel Sannio is a town and comune in the province of Isernia, in the Molise region of southern Italy. 
The town was known simply as Cantalupo until February 4, 1864, when the denomination nel Sannio was added in order to differentiate it from other villages with the same name."Origini del Nome" on the Comune's site [tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] The specification of nel Sannio is derived from the fact that the village is located in the ancient territory of Samnium, which was inhabited by fierce Italic tribes known as the Samnites, famous for their resistance of Roman domination in the Samnite Wars.  The name Cantalupo is thought either to derive from the Greek "Kata-Lupon", "in the middle of the woods", or from the Bulgarian "Kan-Teleped", meaning "chief residence".  The latter explanation is favoured due to the well-established Bulgarian presence in the territory of Samnium going back at least to the 7th century. 
Many Cantalupo's inhabitants emigrated to North America, Australia, South America, and other places following both the Great War and World War II.  A substantial population of Cantalupesi settled in Montreal, Canada, where they founded and still maintain the Associazione di Sant'Anna di Cantalupo, named in honour of the village's patron saint, Saint Anne, Christ's maternal grandmother.  She became Cantalupo's patron following an earthquake on July 26, 1805 (which is the feast day of Saint Anne), that miraculously ended when the Saint's statue was taken out of the village church of San Salvatore.  In 2005, the bicentenary of the miracle was celebrated on July 26, with the return of many expatriates from around the world, and a monument in the town square was dedicated to Cantalupo's sons and daughters in the worldwide Italian diaspora.
The town is also the birthplace of the cantaloupe.

[[Superoptimization]]

CATEGORIES: Compiler optimizations

Superoptimization is the task of finding the optimal code sequence for a single, loop-free sequence of instructions. While garden-variety compiler optimizations really just improve code (real-world compilers generally cannot produce genuinely optimal code), a superoptimizer's goal is to find the optimal sequence.
The term superoptimization was first coined by Alexia Massalin in her 1987 paper and then later developed for integration within the GNU Compiler Collection (GSO 1992). Recent work has further developed and extended this idea: (2001, 2006, 2006).
Typically, superoptimization is performed via exhaustive search in the space of valid instruction sequences. While this is an expensive technique, and therefore impractical for general-purpose compilers, it has been shown to be useful in optimizing performance-critical inner loops. Recent work has used superoptimization to automatically generate general-purpose peephole optimizers.

Immortality, Inc. is a 1959 science fiction novella by American writer Robert Sheckley, about a fictional process whereby a human's consciousness may be transferred into a brain-dead body. A striking foreshadowing in the novel is its description of random killings of strangers by people who intend to die. The serialised form (published under the title Time Killer in the magazine Galaxy Science Fiction) was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel.http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1959-hugo-awards/
The story was loosely adapted into the 1992 film Freejack. A famous scene from the novel involving a character lost in a future New York City and mistakenly getting in line for a suicide booth was dramatized in the pilot episode of Futurama.

Saint Philip of Jesus (Spanish: San Felipe de Jesús) was a Mexican Catholic missionary who became one of the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan, the first Mexican saint and patron saint of Mexico City.
Philip was born in Mexico City in 1572. Though unusually frivolous as a boy, he joined the Reformed Franciscans of the Province of St. Didacus, founded in Mexico by St. Peter Baptista, with whom he suffered martyrdom later. After some months in the Order, Philip grew tired of religious life, left the Franciscans in 1589, took up a mercantile career, and went to the Philippines, another Spanish colony, where he led a life of pleasure. Later he desired to re-enter the Franciscans and was again admitted at Manila in 1590.
After some years it was determined that he was ready for ordination and sent to Mexico for this, since the episcopal see of Manila was vacant at that time, and thus no bishop was available locally to ordain him. He sailed on 12 July 1596, but a storm drove the vessel upon the coast of Japan. The governor of the province confiscated the ship and imprisoned its crew and passengers, among whom were another Franciscan friar, Juan de Zamorra, as well as three other friars, two Augustinians and a Dominican. The discovery of soldiers, cannon and ammunition on the ship led to the suspicion that it was intended for the conquest of Japan, and that the missionaries were merely to prepare the way for the soldiers. This was also said, falsely and unwarrantably, by one of the crew and enraged the Japanese Taikō, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, generally called Taicosama by Europeans. In consequence, he commanded on  December 8, 1596, the arrest of the Franciscans in the friary at Miako, now Kyoto, whither St. Philip had gone.
The friars were all kept prisoners in the friary until December 30, when they were transferred to the city prison. There were six Franciscan friars, seventeen Japanese  Franciscan tertiaries and the Japanese Jesuit Paul Miki, with his two native servants. The ears of the prisoners were cropped on January 3, 1597, and they were paraded through the streets of Kyoto; on January 21 they were taken to Osaka, and thence to Nagasaki, which they reached on February 5, 1597. They were taken to a mountain near Nagasaki city, "Mount of the Martyrs", bound upon crosses, after which they were pierced with spears.

CATEGORIES: 1987 books, Books of film theory, Andrei Tarkovsky

Sculpting in Time (Russian "Запечатлённое время", literally "Depicted Time") is a book by Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky about art and cinema in general, and his own films in particular. It was originally published in 1986 in German shortly before the author's death, and published in English in 1987, translated by Kitty Hunter-Blair. The title refers to Tarkovsky's own name for his style of filmmaking.
The book's main statement about the nature of cinema is summarized in the statement, "The dominant, all-powerful factor of the film image is rhythm, expressing the course of time within the frame." Tarkovsky describes his own distaste for the growing popularity of rapid-cut editing and other devices that he believes to be contrary to the true artistic nature of the cinema.
The book contains a great deal of poetry written by the filmmaker's father Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky along with a fair amount of Tarkovsky's personal writings on his life and work, lectures and discussions during making of Andrei Rublyov with a film history student named Olga Surkova, who later became a professional critic and helped in writing of this book. The book has commentary on each of his 7 major feature films, and his complex relationship with the Soviet Union. The final chapter, a discussion of his film The Sacrifice, was dictated in the last weeks of his life.

Visovac was settled by Augustinian monks, who established a small monastery and church dedicated to the Apostle Paul in the 14th century. In 1445 the Augustinian monastery was enlarged and adapted by the Franciscans who settled here having withdrawn from parts of Bosnia with other, ordinary people, when the Turks had taken over there. A new monastery was built in the 18th century. The rich monastery library includes particularly rare incunabula of Aesop's fables (Brescia 1487) printed by the Lastovo printer Dobrić Dobričević (s. Lastovo), a collection of documents (the sultan's edicts) and a sabre belonging to Vuk Mandušić, one of the best-loved heroes of Serbian epic poetry.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 208, Zagreb (1999), ISBN 953-178-097-8

CATEGORIES: Megaloptera

Fishflies are members of the subfamily Chauliodinae, belonging to the megalopteran family Corydalidae.See references in Haaramo (2008) They are most easily distinguished from their closest relatives, dobsonflies, by the jaws (mandibles) and antennae. In contrast to the large (especially in males) jaws of dobsonflies, fishfly mandibles are not particularly large, menacing or obvious, and the males have feathery antennae similar to many large moths. Chauliodes pectinicornis, the "summer fishfly", is a well-known species in North America. 
In contrast to mayflies, which are small and live only 24 hours as adults, Fishflies are quite large, eat aquatic plants as well as smallish animals including vertebrates like minnows and tadpoles, and may live up to seven days as adults. Their entire lifespan is several years, but most of this time is spent as larvae.

[[Rusticus of Narbonne]]

Saint Rusticus of Narbonne (in French Saint Rustique) (d. 26 OctoberThe date of his feast. (The Roman Calendar). perhaps 461The Catholic Encyclopedia gives the year 461.) was a bishop of Narbonne and Catholic saint of Gaul, born either at Marseilles or at Narbonne.
According to the Roman Martyrology, when he had completed his education in Gaul, Rusticus went to Rome, where he soon gained a reputation as a public speaker, but he wished to embrace the contemplative life. He wrote to Jerome, who advised him to continue his studies, commending him to imitate the virtues of St. Exuperius of Toulouse and to follow the advice of Procule, then Bishop of Marseille.
Thus Rusticus entered the monastery of St. Vincent of Lérins. He was ordained at Marseilles, and on October 3, 430 (or 427) was consecrated Bishop of Narbonne. He was present at the First Council of Ephesus in 431Benedictines, Encyclopedia. With all his zeal, he could not prevent the progress of the Arian heresy which the Goths were spreading abroad; there is evidence that an Arian rival bishop was established in Narbonne.
The siege of Narbonne by the Goths in 436 and dissensions among the Catholics so disheartened him that he wrote to Pope Leo I, renouncing the bishopric, but St. Leo dissuaded him (Epistle CLXVII).
Rusticus then endeavored to consolidate the Catholics. In 444-448, he rebuilt the church in Narbonne dedicated to Saint Genès of Arles, which had burned in 441;William Westcott Kibler, ed. Medieval France: An Encyclopedia, sub "Narbonne", foillowing abbé Sigal, "Les origines de la cathédrale de Narbonne" Bulletin de la Commission Archéologique de Narbonne, (1921). in 451, he assisted at the convocation of forty-four bishops of Gaul and approved St. Leo's letter to Flavian, concerning Nestorianism; he was present also at a Council of Arles, with thirteen bishops, to decide the debate between Theodore, Bishop of Fréjus, and the Abbey of Lérins. He was one of the twelve bishops who assembled to elect Ravennius bishop of Arles in 449;Congratulatory letter of Leo XL 22 August 449 a letter from Ravennius to Rusticus, proves the high esteem in which he was held. Rusticus' own letters are lost, with the exception of the one to St. Jerome and two others to St. Leo, written either in 452 or 458.
