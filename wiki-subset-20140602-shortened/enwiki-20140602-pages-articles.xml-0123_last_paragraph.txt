[[Clan]]

CATEGORIES: Kinship and descent

A clan is a group of people united by actual or perceived kinship and descent. Even if lineage details are unknown, clan members may be organized around a founding member or apical ancestor. The kinship-based bonds may be symbolical, whereby the clan shares a "stipulated" common ancestor that is a symbol of the clan's unity. When this "ancestor" is non-human, it is referred to as a totem, which is frequently an animal. Clans can be most easily described as tribes or sub-groups of tribes. The word clan is derived from clann meaning children or progeny but not family in the Irish language[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Dineen | first1 = Patrick S. | title = Foclóir Gaeďilge agus Béarla an IRISH-ENGLISH DICTIONARY | year = 1927 | publisher = The Educational Company of Ireland, Ltd | location =  Dublin and Cork, Ireland [/tpl][tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Ó Dónaill | first1 = Niall | title = Foclóir Gaeilge–Béarla | year = 1992 | publisher = An Gúm | location =  Dublin, Ireland | isbn = 1-85791-037-0 [/tpl] and Scottish Gaelic languages. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word was introduced into English around the year 1425 as a label for the tribal nature of the Scottish Highlands society."Clan", Online Etymology Dictionary Clans in indigenous societies are likely to be exogamous, meaning that their members cannot marry one another.  Clans preceded more centralized forms of community organization and government; they are located in every country. Members may identify with a coat of arms or other symbol to show they are an independent clan.

[[Chicago Enforcers]]
CATEGORIES: XFL teams, Sports clubs established in 2001, Sports clubs disestablished in 2001, Defunct American football teams, American football teams in Chicago, Illinois

The Chicago Enforcers were a short-lived American football team based in Chicago, Illinois at Soldier Field. This team was part of the failed XFL begun by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment and by NBC, a major television network in the United States. NBC dropped the XFL concept after the first season in 2001 due to dismal ratings, and the dissolution of the league was announced shortly afterwards.
The team name references mob enforcers, alluding to Chicago's history of mafia influence (see, for instance, Al Capone) and continuing a theme of naming teams with themes of evil, insanity, or criminal activity ("Enforcers" falling into the last of these categories).
Originally, rumors swirled that former Chicago Bears defensive coordinator and Philadelphia Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan would be hired as the team's coach;"XFL May Bring Buddyball to Soldier Field"; Greg Couch, Chicago Sun-Times; June 13, 2000 ultimately, Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus was hired for the position. However, just before the season started, he resigned to take a position in the XFL office.  He was replaced by coaching veteran Ron Meyer.
Among their players was former NFL running back LeShon Johnson, who had played for the Green Bay Packers, Arizona Cardinals and the New York Giants. He was starting tailback for the Cardinals for most of 1996. He led the Enforcers with 6 rushing touchdowns, which was second in the league. They also had former NFL running back John Avery who played for the Miami Dolphins.  Their wide receiver/kick returner Roell Preston (who previously played for the Atlanta Falcons, Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, San Francisco 49ers, and Tennessee Titans) held the distinction of being the only former Pro Bowler (1998 as a Packer) to play in the XFL.  The team's starting right guard, Bennie Anderson, went on to be a starter for the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills, and last played professional football in 2006 for the Miami Dolphins.
The Enforcers got off to a slow start, losing their first four games with Tim Lester, who prior to joining the XFL was (as frequently noted) a math teacher, at starting quarterback. In week 5, the team replaced Lester with the former Notre Dame Quatrerback Kevin McDougal and the team went 5-1 in the rest of the season (winning their last four in a row), coming from behind to make the XFL playoffs at 2nd place in the Eastern Division. In addition to their potent rushing attack led by league leading running back John Avery, they were also known for their hard hitting defense. They lost to eventual XFL champion Los Angeles Xtreme in the crossover semifinals.
The Enforcers were part of the Eastern Division with the Orlando Rage, New York/New Jersey Hitmen and the Birmingham Thunderbolts. Their radio flagship station was WMVP, ESPN Radio 1000.

Caodaism or Caodaiism (Vietnamese: Đạo Cao Đài道高臺, "Way of the Highest Power"; [tpl]zh|c=高台教|p=Gāotáijiào[/tpl]) is a monotheistic religion, officially established in the city of Tây Ninh in southern Vietnam, in 1926.Hoskins, 2012. p. 3 The full name of the religion is Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ ("Great Way the Third Time of Redemption"). Followers also call their religion Đạo Trời ("Way of God"). Caodaism has common roots and similarities with the Chinese Tiên Thiên Đạo doctrinesGoossaert, Palmer, 2011. pp. 100-102 and the Minh Đạo religions within Vietnamese Thanism.Jammes, 2010.
Cao Đài ([tpl]IPA-vi|kāːw ɗâːj|lang|Cao Dai.ogg[/tpl], literally the "Highest Lord" or "Highest Power") is the utmost deity, originating the universe, worshipped by the Caodaists. He is the same as the Jade Emperor.Oliver, 1997. p. 7 Caodaists often use the term Đức Cao Đài (Venerable High Lord) as the abbreviated name for the creator of the universe, whose full title is Cao Đài Tiên Ông Đại Bồ Tát Ma Ha Tát ("Highest Power the Ancient Wise and Great Enlightening Highest Being"). The symbol of the faith is the Left Eye of God, representing the dương (masculine, ordaining, positive and expansive) activity of the Lord.Hoskins, 2012. pp. 3-4
Adherents engage in ethical practices such as prayer, veneration of ancestors, nonviolence, and vegetarianism with the goal of the union with God and freedom from the cycle of birth and death. Estimates of the number of Caodaists in Vietnam vary; current government figures give 3.2 million for Caodaists affiliated to the Tây Ninh church, with numbers rising up to 4 to 6 million if other branches are added.Hoskins, 2012. p. 4, note 1Janet Alison Hoskins. What Are Vietnam's Indigenous Religions?. Center for Southeast Asian Studies Kyoto University, 2012. An additional number of adherents in the tens of thousands, primarily ethnic Vietnamese, live in the United States, Europe, and Australia. The design of Caodaist temples, shape and coloring, is quite standard around the world and includes the incorporation of sacred images, symbols, and colors.June/ July2013 Afar page 45

[[The Oath]]
CATEGORIES: 1973 novels, 20th-century American novels, World War II novels, Personal accounts of the Holocaust, Novels set in Hungary, Novels by Elie Wiesel

The Oath is the English title of Le serment de Kolvillag, a novel by Elie Wiesel. It tells the story of Azriel, the only surviving Jewish member of the small Hungarian town of Kolvillag after a pogrom perpetrated by neighboring Christians. Azriel carries the secret of Kollvilag's destruction within him, forbidden to share his experiences. However, when Azriel meets a young man on the brink of suicide fifty years later, he realizes that he must pass on his secret to save the young man's life - yet he is bound by his promise to the dead.
Le serment de Kolvillag is a powerful work told in fragments - the point of view changes from present-day Azriel, the Azriel of the past, the young man in the present, and the young man's past. It is unstructured to the point where it borders on Surrealism. Some of the themes of Le serment de Kolvillag include pogroms, death, old age, secrecy, silence, and modernity.

CATEGORIES: English phrases, Memes, Military humor, Military history of the United States during World War II, Graffiti and unauthorised signage, Fore River Shipyard

Kilroy was here is an American popular culture expression that became popular during World War II; it is typically seen in  graffiti. Its origins are debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle — a bald-headed man (sometimes depicted as having a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with the fingers of each hand clutching the wall — became associated with GIs in the 1940s.
In the United Kingdom, the graffiti is known as "Mr Chad" or just "Chad", and the Australian equivalent to the phrase is "Foo was here". "Foo was here" might date from World War I, and the character of Chad may have derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating "Kilroy was here".  Etymologist Dave Wilton says, "Some time during the war, Chad and Kilroy met, and in the spirit of Allied unity merged, with the British drawing appearing over the American phrase." "Foo was here" became popular amongst Australian schoolchildren of post-war generations. Other names for the character include Smoe, Clem, Flywheel, Private Snoops, Overby, The Jeep, and Sapo.
Author Charles Panati says that in the United States "the mischievous face and the phrase became a national joke... The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said, but where it turned up."[tpl]cite web|title=What's the origin of "Kilroy was here"?|work=The Straight Dope|date = 2000-08-04|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1812/whats-the-origin-of-kilroy-was-here|accessdate = [/tpl] The major Kilroy graffiti fad ended in the 1950s, but today people all over the world still scribble the character and "Kilroy was here" in schools, trains, and other similar public areas.

He was nicknamed "One-eyed Žižka." Since his youth, he was attached to the royal court and held the office of Chamberlain to Queen Sophia.
He fought in the Battle of Grunwald (July 15, 1410), where he defended Radzyń against the Teutonic Order. Later he played a prominent role in the civil wars in Bohemia during the reign of Wenceslas IV. Žižka's tactics were unorthodox and innovative. In addition to training and equipping his army according to their abilities, he used armored wagons armed with small cannons and muskets, presaging the tank of five hundred years later. He was also a master at using geography to full advantage as well as managing the discipline of his troops. Žižka is considered to be among the greatest military leaders and innovators of all time and is one of seven commanders in history who never lost a battle (alongside Alexander the Great, Scipio Africanus, Khalid ibn al-Walid, Genghis Khan, Alexander Suvorov, and Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck).http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/jan-zizka-at-grunwald-from-mercenary-to-czech-national-hero

[[Amanita]]

CATEGORIES: Amanita

The genus Amanita contains about 600 species of agarics including some of the most toxic known mushrooms found worldwide, as well as some well-regarded edible species. This genus is responsible for approximately 95% of the fatalities resulting from mushroom poisoning, with the death cap accounting for about 50% on its own. The most potent toxin present in these mushrooms is α-amanitin.
The genus also contains many edible mushrooms, but mycologists discourage mushroom hunters, other than knowledgeable experts, from selecting any of these for human consumption. Nonetheless, in some cultures, the larger local edible species of Amanita are mainstays of the markets in the local growing season.  Samples of this are Amanita zambiana and other fleshy species in central Africa, A. basii and similar species in Mexico, A. caesarea in Europe, and A. chepangiana in South-East Asia. Other species are used for colouring sauces, such as the red A. jacksonii with a range from eastern Canada to eastern Mexico.
Many species are of unknown edibility, especially in countries such as Australia, where many fungi are little-known. Understandably, this is not a genus that lends itself to safe experimentation.

[[Top Fuel]]

CATEGORIES: Drag racing, Racing car classes

Top fuel dragsters are the fastest sanctioned category of drag racers, with the fastest competitors reaching speeds of [tpl]convert|330|mph|km/h[/tpl] and finishing the [tpl]convert|1000|foot|m[/tpl] runs in 3.7 seconds, or the full quarter-mile (402 m) in 4.4 seconds.
Because of the speeds, this class almost exclusively races to only the [tpl]convert|1000|foot|m[/tpl] distance, and not the traditional 1/4 mile (1,320 foot / 402 m).  The rule was changed in 2008 by the National Hot Rod Association following the fatal crash of Funny Car driver Scott Kalitta during qualifying at the SuperNationals, held at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park in Englishtown, NJ.  The shortening of the distance was used in the FIA at some tracks, and for 2012 is now the standard Top Fuel distance.  The Australian National Drag Racing Association is the only internationally recognized sanctioning body that races at 1,320 foot for the majority of races in Top Fuel.
A top fuel dragster accelerates from a standstill to [tpl]convert|100|mph|km/h[/tpl] in as little as 0.8 seconds (less than one fifth the time required by a production Porsche 911 Turbo to reach [tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h[/tpl]) and can exceed [tpl]convert|280|mph|km/h[/tpl] in just [tpl]convert|660|ft|m[/tpl]. This acceleration subjects the driver to an average force of about 4.0 G over the duration of the race.

The New England Revolution is an American professional soccer club based in Foxborough, Massachusetts that competes in Major League Soccer (MLS). It is one of the ten charter clubs of MLS, having competed in the league since its inception.
The club is owned by Robert Kraft, who also owns the New England Patriots. The name "Revolution" refers to the New England region's significant involvement in the American Revolution.
The Revs currently play their home matches at Gillette Stadium. The club played their home games at the adjacent and now-demolished Foxboro Stadium, from 1996 until 2001. The Revs hold the distinction of being the only original MLS team to have every league game in its history televised.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.revolutionsoccer.net/search/index.cfm?ac=searchdetail&pid=18665&pcid=115 | title=Revolution announces TV and radio schedule for 2006 | date=2006-03-14[/tpl]
The Revolution were one of the ten original MLS franchises to compete in the league's inaugural season. However, it took them until 2007—their twelfth year of existence—to win their first trophy, the 2007 US Open Cup. The following year, they won the 2008 North American SuperLiga. The Revolution have never won an MLS Cup nor MLS Supporters' Shield, despite reaching the MLS Cup finals in 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2007; and having the second best regular season record in 2005.

The Tampa Bay Mutiny was a charter franchise of Major League Soccer active from 1996 to 2001. They initially played in Tampa Stadium and were immediately successful, winning the first MLS Supporters' Shield behind MLS MVP Carlos Valderrama and high-scoring forward Roy Lassiter, whose 27 goals in 1996 is still the MLS single-season record.
The team hosted the last event at the "Big Sombrero", a 2–1 win over the MetroStars on September 21, 1998. The Mutiny moved to newly built Raymond James Stadium starting with the 1999 season.
The Mutiny had been competitive for its first few seasons. However, as they transitioned into their new home, the trading of popular players (including both Valderrama and Lassiter for little in return) led to less exciting soccer and decreased fan support.

He was one of the perpetrators of the Great Purge as well as the Stalinist decimation of the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.
Following the 1945 Battle of Berlin, Mielke returned to Germany and had a major role in organizing the Soviet Zone into a dictatorship under the Socialist Unity Party. Between 1957 and 1989, Mielke was the head of the East German secret police, or Stasi. According to historian John Koehler, Mielke built the Stasi, "into an instrument for the ruthless oppression of East Germany's population as well as into one of the world's most effective intelligence services."

[[Trial and error]]
CATEGORIES: Error, Heuristics, Learning methods, Problem solving, Philosophy of science

Trial and error is a fundamental method of solving problems.Evolutionary Epistemology, Rationality, and the Sociology of Knowledge p94 p108 It is characterised by repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success,Concise Oxford Dictionary p1489 or until the agent stops trying. It is an unsystematic method which does not employ insight, theory or organised methodology.
According to W.H. Thorpe, the term was devised by C. Lloyd Morgan after trying out similar phrases "trial and failure" and "trial and practice".Thorpe W.H. The origins and rise of ethology. Hutchinson, London & Praeger, New York. p26. ISBN 0-03-053251-1 Under Morgan's canon, animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way. Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial and error learning. An example is the skillful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.
Edward Thorndike showed how to manage a trial and error experiment in the laboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the law of effect in learning.Thorndike E.L. 1898. Animal intelligence: an experimental study of the association processes in animals. Psychological Monographs #8. He plotted learning curves which recorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended by B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning.
Trial and error is  also a heuristic method of problem solving, repair, tuning, or obtaining knowledge. In the field of computer science, the method is called generate and test.  In elementary algebra, when solving equations, it is "guess and check".
This approach can be seen as one of the two basic approaches to problem solving, contrasted with an approach using insight and theory. However, there are intermediate methods which for example, use theory to guide the method, an approach known as guided empiricism.

Wilberforce University is a private, coed, liberal arts historically black university (HBCU) located in Wilberforce, Ohio.  Affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, it was the first college to be owned and operated by African Americans.  It participates in the United Negro College Fund.
The founding of the college was unique as a collaboration in 1856 by the Cincinnati, Ohio Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME).  They planned a college to provide classical education and teacher training for black youth.  Leaders of both races made up the first board members.
When the number of students fell due to the American Civil War and financial losses closed the college in 1863, the AME Church purchased the institution to ensure its survival.  Its first president, AME Bishop Daniel A. Payne, was one of the original founders.  Prominent supporters and the US government donated funds for rebuilding after a fire in 1865.  When the college added an industrial department in the late 19th century, state legislators could sponsor scholarship students.
The college attracted the top professors of the day, including W. E. B. Du Bois.  In the 19th century, it enlarged its mission to include students from South Africa.  The university supports the national Association of African American Museums to broaden the reach of its programs and assist smaller museums with professional standards.

[[Aureola]]

CATEGORIES: Religious symbols, Christian iconography, History of astrology, Eastern Christian liturgy

An aureola or aureole (diminutive of Latin aurea, "golden") is the radiance of luminous cloud which, in paintings of sacred personages, surrounds the whole figure. In the earliest periods of Christian art it was confined to the figures of the persons of the Christian Godhead,[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] but it was afterwards extended to the Virgin Mary and to several of the saints.
The aureola, when enveloping the whole body, generally appears oval or elliptical in form, but occasionally depicted as circular, vesica piscis, or quatrefoil. When it appears merely as a luminous disk round the head, it is called specifically a halo or nimbus, while the combination of nimbus and aureole is called a glory. The strict distinction between nimbus and aureole is not commonly maintained, and the latter term is most frequently used to denote the radiance round the heads of saints, angels or Persons of the Trinity.
This is not to be confused with the specific motif in art of the Infant Jesus appearing to be a source of light in a Nativity scene.  These depictions derive directly from the accounts given by Saint Bridget of Sweden of her visions, in which she describes seeing this.G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I,1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 76-78 & figs, ISBN 853312702
The nimbus in Christian art first appeared in the 5th century, but practically the same motif was known from several centuries earlier, in pre-Christian Hellenistic art. It is found in some Persian representations of kings and gods, and appears on coins of the Kushan kings Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasudeva, as well as on most representations of the Buddha in Greco-Buddhist art from the 1st century AD. Its use has also been traced through the Egyptians to the ancient Greeks and Romans, representations of Trajan (arch of Constantine) and Antoninus Pius (reverse of a medal) being found with it. Roman emperors were sometimes depicted wearing a radiant crown, with pointed rays intended to represent the rays of the sun.  According to Islamic tradition, the Prophet Mohammed may not be depicted representationally; however some religious artists have indicated his presence in historical scenes using an empty, flaming aureole as a placeholder.
In the circular form the nimbus constitutes a natural and even primitive use of the idea of a crown,[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] modified by an equally simple idea of the emanation of light from the head of a superior being, or by the meteorological phenomenon of a halo. The probability is that all later associations with the symbol refer back to an early astrological origin (compare  Mithras), the person so glorified being identified with the sun and represented in the sun's image; so the aureole is the Hvareno of Mazdaism.[ref]
</ref> From this early [[astrology|astrological]] use, the form of "glory" or "nimbus" has been adapted or inherited under new beliefs.

It was launched unmanned using a Proton-K rocket. The first crew launched later in the Soyuz 10 mission, but they ran into troubles while docking and were unable to enter the station; the Soyuz 10 mission was aborted and the crew returned safely to Earth. Its second crew launched in Soyuz 11 and remained on board for 23 days. This was the first time in the history of spaceflight that a space station had been manned, and a new record in time spent in space. This success was however overshadowed when the crew was killed during reentry, as a pressure-equalization valve in the Soyuz 11 reentry capsule had opened prematurely, causing the crew to suffocate. After this accident, missions were suspended while the Soyuz spacecraft was redesigned. The station was intentionally destroyed by de-orbiting it after six months in orbit, because it ran out of fuel before a redesigned Soyuz spacecraft could be launched to it.[tpl]cite book |author=Shayler, David; Rex Hall |title=Soyuz: A Universal Spacecraft (Springer-Praxis Books in Astronomy and Space Sciences) |publisher=Telos Pr |year=2003 |pages=172–179 |isbn=1-85233-657-9 |url=http://books.google.pl/books?id=dbGchpi1HP8C&pg=PA180#v=onepage [/tpl]

It attained an altitude of 219 to 270 km on launchBond (2002). and NASA reported its final orbital altitude was 268 to 272 km.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1974-046A|title=Salyut 3 - NSSDC ID: 1974-046A|publisher=NASA[/tpl] Only one of the three intended crews successfully boarded and manned the station, brought by Soyuz 14; Soyuz 15 attempted to bring a second crew but failed to dock.
Although little official information has been released about the station, several sources report that it contained multiple Earth-observation cameras, as well as an on-board gun. The station was deorbited, and re-entered the atmosphere on 24 January 1975. The next space station launched by the Soviet Union was the civilian station Salyut 4; the next military station was Salyut 5, which was the final Almaz space station.

Salyut 4 (DOS 4) ([tpl]lang-ru|Салют-4[/tpl]; English translation: Salute 4) was a Salyut space station launched on December 26, 1974 into an orbit with an apogee of 355 km, a perigee of 343 km and an orbital inclination of 51.6 degrees. It was essentially a copy of the DOS 3, and unlike its ill-fated sibling it was a complete success. Three crews attempted to make stays aboard Salyut 4 (Soyuz 17 and Soyuz 18 docked; Soyuz 18a suffered a launch abort). The second stay was for 63 days duration, and an unmanned Soyuz capsule remained docked to the station for three months, proving the system's long-term durability. Salyut 4 was deorbited February 2, 1977, and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on February 3.

Salyut 5 ([tpl]lang-ru|Салют-5[/tpl] meaning Salute 5), also known as OPS-3, was a Soviet space station. Launched in 1976 as part of the Salyut programme, it was the third and last Almaz space station to be launched for the Soviet military. Two Soyuz missions visited the station, each manned by two cosmonauts. A third Soyuz mission attempted to visit the station, but failed to dock, whilst a fourth mission was planned but never launched.

Salyut 6 ([tpl]lang-ru|Салют-6[/tpl]; lit. Salute 6), DOS-5, was a Soviet orbital space station, the eighth flown as part of the Salyut programme. Launched on 29 September 1977 by a Proton rocket, the station was the first of the 'second-generation' type of space station. Salyut 6 possessed several revolutionary advances over the earlier Soviet space stations, which it nevertheless resembled in overall design. These included the addition of a second docking port, a new main propulsion system and the station's primary scientific instrument, the BST-1M multispectral telescope. The addition of the second docking port made crew handovers and station resupply by unmanned Progress freighters possible for the first time, which in turn allowed the programme to evolve from short-duration station visits to long-duration expeditions, marking the beginning of the transition to multi-modular, long-term research stations in space.
From 1977 until 1982, Salyut 6 was visited by five long- and eleven short-duration crews, including cosmonauts from Warsaw Pact countries as part of the Intercosmos programme. These crews were responsible for carrying out the primary missions of Salyut 6, including astronomy, Earth-resources observations and the study of the effect of spaceflight on the human body. Following the completion of these missions and the launch of its successor, Salyut 7, Salyut 6 was deorbited on 29 July 1982, almost five years after its launch.

Various crew and modules were used over its lifetime, including a total of 12 manned and 15 unmanned launches. Supporting spacecraft included the Soyuz T, Progress, and TKS spacecraft.
It was part of the Soviet Salyut programme, and launched on 19 April 1982 on a Proton rocket from Site 200/40 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in what was then the Soviet Union. Salyut 7 was part of the transition from "monolithic" to "modular" space stations, acting as a testbed for docking of additional modules and expanded station operations. It was the tenth space station of any kind launched. Salyut 7 was the last Space Station of the Salyut Program, which was replaced by Mir.

Many of the organization's founders had been jailed during World War I for refusing military service.  From the Fellowship of Reconciliation many Jews, suffragists, socialists, and anarchists separated to form this more secular organization.
Although the WRL was opposed to US participation in World War II, it did not protest against it; the WRL
complied with the Espionage Act, ceased public protests, and did not solicit new
members during this period.Bennett, p. 74. During World War II, many members were 
imprisoned as conscientious objectors.Bennett, p. 69ff In the 1950s, WRL members worked in the US civil rights movement and organized protests against nuclear weapons testing and civil defense drills.  In the 1960s, WRL was the first pacifist organization to call for an end to the Vietnam War.  The organization's opposition to nuclear weapons was extended to include nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s. The WRL has also been active in feminist and anti-racist causes and works with other organizations to reduce the level of violence in modern culture.

[[Fume hood]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory equipment, Ventilation

A fume hood or fume cupboard is a type of local"Study of Factors Affecting Fume Hood Energy Consumption1".pdf by American AutoMatrix ventilation device that is designed to limit exposure to hazardous or toxic fumes, vapors or dusts. A fume hood is typically a large piece of equipment enclosing five sides of a work area, the bottom of which is most commonly located at a standing work height.
Two main types exist, ducted and recirculating (aka ductless). The principle is the same for both types: air is drawn in from the front (open) side of the cabinet, and either expelled outside the building or made safe through filtration and fed back into the room.
Other related types of local ventilation devices include: clean benches, biosafety cabinets, glove boxes and snorkel exhausts. All these devices address the need to control airborne hazards or irritants that are typically generated or released within the local ventilation device. All local ventilation devices are designed to address one or more of three primary goals:
Secondary functions of these devices may include explosion protection, spill containment, and other functions necessary to the work being done within the device.
A general but non-specific term for some of these local ventilation devices is Laminar flow cabinet. This category may include clean benches, biosafety cabinets and other devices characterized simply by the laminar nature of their airflow. The term laminar flow cabinet, however, is insufficient to identify their actual design and use - some will protect the product but not the user, and others will protect both. Terminology for local ventilation devices has been, and remains, unclear and  non-specific, and the reader is advised to take special care in selection and specification based upon which of the three primary goals (listed above) are to be met.
Fume hoods typically protect only the user, and are most commonly used in laboratories where hazardous or noxious chemicals are released during testing, research, development or teaching. They are also used in industrial applications or other activities where hazardous or noxious vapors, gases or dusts are generated or released.
Because one side (the front) of a fume hood is open to the room occupied by the user, and the air within the fume hood is potentially contaminated, the proper flow of air from the room into the hood is critical to its function. Much of fume hood design and operation is focused on maximizing the proper containment of the air and fumes within the fume hood.
As most fume hoods are designed to connect to exhaust systems that expel the air directly to the exterior of a building, large quantities of energy are required to run fans that exhaust the air, and to heat, cool, filter, control and move the air that will replace the air exhausted. Significant recent efforts in fume hood and ventilation system design have focused on reducing the energy used to operate fume hoods and their supporting ventilation systems.

[[Twelve Minor Prophets]]
CATEGORIES: Minor Prophets, Christian saints from the Old Testament, Nevi'im

The Minor Prophets or Twelve Prophets ([tpl]lang-arc|תרי עשר[/tpl], Trei Asar, "The Twelve"), occasionally Book of the Twelve, is the last book of the Nevi'im, the second main division of the Jewish Tanakh. The collection is broken up to form twelve individual books in the Christian Old Testament, one for each of the prophets. The terms "minor prophets" and "twelve prophets" can also refer to the twelve traditional authors of these works.
The term "Minor" relates to the length of each book (ranging from a single chapter to fourteen); even the longest is short compared to the three major prophets, Isaiah, Ezekiel and Jeremiah. It is not known when these short works were collected and transferred to a single scroll, but the first extra-biblical evidence we have for the Twelve as a collection is c. 190 BCE in the writings of Jesus ben Sirach,[tpl]harvnb|Zvi|2004|pp=1139–42[/tpl] and evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls suggests that the modern order was established by 150 BCE.[tpl]Sfn |Redditt|2003|p=1[/tpl]  It is believed that initially the first six were collected, and later the second six were added; the two groups seem to complement each other, with Hosea through Micah raising the question of iniquity, and Nahum through Malachi proposing resolutions.[tpl]Sfn |Coggins | Han|2011|p= 4[/tpl]

Cypermethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid used as an insecticide in large-scale commercial agricultural applications as well as in consumer products for domestic purposes. It behaves as a fast-acting neurotoxin in insects. It is easily degraded on soil and plants but can be effective for weeks when applied to indoor inert surfaces. Exposure to sunlight, water and oxygen will accelerate its decomposition. Cypermethrin is highly toxic to fish, bees and aquatic insects, according to the National Pesticides Telecommunications Network (NPTN).

The Difference Engine is an alternate history novel by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. It is widely regarded as one of the first "true" steampunk books written in the late 20th century.
It posits a Victorian Britain in which great technological and social change has occurred after entrepreneurial inventor Charles Babbage succeeded in his ambition to build a mechanical computer (actually his analytical engine rather than the difference engine).
The novel was nominated for the British Science Fiction Award in 1990, the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991, and both the John W. Campbell Memorial Award and the Prix Aurora Award in 1992.

USS ''Intrepid'' (CV/CVA/CVS-11), also known as The Fighting "I", is one of 24 [tpl]Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier[/tpl]s built during World War II for the United States Navy. She is the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name.  Commissioned in August 1943, Intrepid participated in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, most notably the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). In her second career, she served mainly in the Atlantic, but also participated in the Vietnam War. Her notable achievements include being the recovery ship for a Mercury and a Gemini space mission. Because of her prominent role in battle, she was nicknamed "the Fighting I", while her often ill-luck and the time spent in dry dock for repairs earned her the nickname "the Dry I".
Decommissioned in 1974, in 1982 Intrepid became the foundation of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City.

Namtar (or Namtaru, or Namtara; meaning destiny or fate), was a hellish minor deity in Mesopotamian mythology, god of death, and minister and messenger of An, Ereshkigal, and Nergal.Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary By Jeremy A. Black, Anthony Green, p 134http://www.encyclo.co.uk/define/Namtar
Namtar was the son of Enlil anid Ereshkigal; he was born before his father raped the goddess Ninlil. Namtar was considered responsible for diseases and pests. It was said that he commanded sixty diseases in the form of demons that could penetrate different parts of the human body; offerings to him were made to prevent those illnesses. It is thought that the Assyrians and Babylonians took this belief from the Sumerians after conquering them. To some they were the spirit of fate, and therefore of great importance. Apparently they executed the instructions given him concerning the fate of men, and could also have power over certain of the gods. In other writings they were regarded as the personification of death, much like the modern concept of the Grim Reaper.Mesopotamian religion and Ereshkigal under Encyclopædia BritannicaThe Doctrine of Sin in the Babylonian Religion By Julian Morgenstern, Paul Tice p 18-19.Myths of Babylonia and Assyria By Donald A. Mackenzie p.178
In the story of Ishtar's Descent to earth, acting as Ereshkigal's 'messenger', Namtar curses Ishtar with 60 diseases, naming five of the head, feet, side, eyes, and heart, after she arrives to earth.An Encyclopaedia of Religions by Maurice Arthur Canney p. 258
Namtar was regarded as the beloved son of Bêl/Enlil, and was married to the underworld goddess Hušbišag.

[[Shadow paging]]

CATEGORIES: Database algorithms, Computer file systems

In computer science, shadow paging is a technique for providing atomicity and  durability (two of the ACID properties) in database systems.
Shadow paging is a copy-on-write technique for avoiding in-place updates of pages.  Instead, when a page is to be modified, a shadow page is allocated.  Since the shadow page has no references (from other pages on disk), it can be modified liberally, without concern for consistency constraints, etc.  When the page is ready to become  durable, all pages that referred to the original are updated to refer to the new replacement page instead.  Because the page is "activated" only when it is ready, it is atomic.
If the referring pages must also be updated via shadow paging, this procedure may  recurse many times, becoming quite costly.  One solution, employed by the WAFL file system (Write Anywhere File Layout) is to be lazy about making pages durable (i.e. write-behind caching).  This increases performance significantly by avoiding many writes on hotspots high up in the referential hierarchy (e.g.: a file system superblock) at the cost of high commit latency.
Write ahead logging is a more popular solution that uses in-place updates.[tpl]fact|date=September 2012[/tpl]
Shadow paging is similar to the old master-new master batch processing technique used in mainframe database systems.  In these systems, the output of each batch run (possibly a day's work) was written to two separate  disks or other form of storage medium.  One was kept for backup, and the other was used as the starting point for the next day's work.
Shadow paging is also similar to purely functional data structures, in that in-place updates are avoided.

The coalition's mission is "to advocate international economic policies and human rights that support women worldwide in ending poverty in their lives, communities and nations."idealist.org - Women's Edge Coalition
In 2005, Amnesty International USA and Women's Edge organized meetings with members of the United States Senate to work toward legislation to combat violence against women and girls around the world. These meetings led to the 2007 International Violence Against Women Act, which was introduced by Senators Joseph Biden and Richard Lugar.USA: Human Rights, Women's and Anti-Violence Groups Praise Legislation to Combat Global Violence against Women

According to USAID, "due in large part" to Women's Edge, "the interests of poor women worldwide are now being incorporated into U.S. economic assistance and trade policies and, in some cases, into U.S. law itself.
A first generation American of East Indian heritage, Ms. Sharma's family left behind generations of violence and poverty in Punjab, India to build a new life in the United States. Her family's legacy and her first-hand experience of the injustices suffered by women, combined with her strong belief that American citizens must ensure that the U.S. acts positively in the world, led Ms. Sharma to create the Women's Edge Coalition in 1998. She holds a BSFS in international economics from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and a Masters of Public Health from Johns Hopkins University. She serves on the Board of Directors of InterAction and the Center for Global Engagement.

[[Plaza]]

CATEGORIES: Town squares, Urban design

A plaza [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|ɑː|z|ə[/tpl] is an open urban public space, such as a city square.[tpl]cite web|title=plaza|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plaza|publisher=Reference.com[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=place|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=place&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=place|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/place|publisher=Merriam Webster[/tpl] [tpl]LSJ|platu/s|πλατεῖα|ref[/tpl].
All through Spanish America and the Spanish East Indies, the plaza mayor of each center of administration held three closely related institutions: the cathedral, the cabildo or administrative center, which might be incorporated in a wing of a governor's palace, and the audiencia or law court. The plaza might be large enough to serve as a military parade ground. At times of crisis or fiesta, it was the space where a large crowd might gather. Like the Italian piazza, the plaza remains a center of community life that is only equaled by the market-place.
Most colonial cities in Spanish America and the Philippines were planned around a square plaza de armas, where troops could be mustered, as the name implies, surrounded by the governor's palace and the main church.  A plaza de toros is a bullring.
In modern usage, a plaza can be any gathering place on a street or between buildings, a street intersection with a statue, etc.  Today's metropolitan landscapes often incorporate the "plaza" as a design element, or as an outcome of zoning regulations, building budgetary constraints, and the like.  Sociologist William H. Whyte conducted an extensive study of plazas in New York City: his study humanized the way modern urban plazas are conceptualized, and helped usher in significant design changes in the making of plazas.

[[Durability (database systems)]]
CATEGORIES: Data management, Transaction processing

In database systems, durability is the ACID property which guarantees that transactions that have committed will survive permanently. 
For example, if a flight booking reports that a seat has successfully been booked, then the seat will remain booked even if the system crashes.
Durability can be achieved by flushing the transaction's log records to non-volatile storage before acknowledging commitment.
In distributed transactions, all participating servers must coordinate before commit can be acknowledged. This is usually done by a two-phase commit protocol.
Many DBMSs implement durability by writing transactions into a transaction log that can be reprocessed to recreate the system state right before any later failure. A transaction is deemed committed only after it is entered in the log.

[[Instruction-level parallelism]]

CATEGORIES: Instruction processing, Parallel computing

Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) is a measure of how many of the operations in a computer program can be performed simultaneously. The potential overlap among instructions is called instruction level parallelism.
There are two approaches to instruction level parallelism:
Hardware level works upon dynamic parallelism whereas, the software level works on static parallelism.[tpl]cite book |title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|first=John L.|last=Hennessy|first2=David A.|last2=Patterson|[/tpl] The Pentium processor works on the dynamic sequence of parallel execution but the Itanium processor works on the static level parallelism.
Consider the following program:
Operation 3 depends on the results of operations 1 and 2, so it cannot be calculated until both of them are completed.  However, operations 1 and 2 do not depend on any other operation, so they can be calculated simultaneously.  If we assume that each operation can be completed in one unit of time then these three instructions can be completed in a total of two units of time, giving an ILP of 3/2.
A goal of compiler and processor designers is to identify and take advantage of as much ILP as possible. Ordinary programs are typically written under a sequential execution model where instructions execute one after the other and in the order specified by the programmer. ILP allows the compiler and the processor to overlap the execution of multiple instructions or even to change the order in which instructions are executed.
How much ILP exists in programs is very application specific. In certain fields, such as graphics and scientific computing the amount can be very large. However, workloads such as cryptography may exhibit much less parallelism.
Micro-architectural techniques that are used to exploit ILP include:
Dataflow architectures are another class of architectures where ILP is explicitly specified, for a recent example see the TRIPS architecture.
In recent years, ILP techniques have been used to provide performance improvements in spite of the growing disparity between processor operating frequencies and memory access times (early ILP designs such as the IBM System/360 Model 91 used ILP techniques to overcome the limitations imposed by a relatively small register file). Presently, a cache miss penalty to main memory costs several hundreds of CPU cycles. While in principle it is possible to use ILP to tolerate even such memory latencies the associated resource and power dissipation costs are disproportionate. Moreover, the complexity and often the latency of the underlying hardware structures results in reduced operating frequency further reducing any benefits. Hence, the aforementioned techniques prove inadequate to keep the CPU from stalling for the off-chip data. Instead, the industry is heading towards exploiting higher levels of parallelism that can be exploited through techniques such as multiprocessing and multithreading.  Reflections of the Memory Wall

Distributed generation, also  called on-site generation, dispersed generation, embedded generation, decentralized generation, decentralized energy, distributed energy or district energy,District Energy and CHP, www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 16 September 2013  generates electricity from many small energy sources.  Most countries generate electricity in large centralized facilities, such as fossil fuel (coal, gas powered), nuclear, large solar power plants or hydropower plants. These plants have excellent economies of scale, but usually transmit electricity long distances and can negatively affect the environment. Distributed generation allows collection of energy from many sources and may give lower environmental impacts and improved security of supply.

[[Ulcer (dermatology)]]
CATEGORIES: Dermatologic terminology

An ulcer is a sore on the skin or a mucous membrane, accompanied by the disintegration of tissue. Ulcers can result in complete loss of the epidermis and often portions of the dermis and even subcutaneous fat. Ulcers are most common on the skin of the lower extremities and in the gastrointestinal tract. An ulcer that appears on the skin is often visible as an inflamed tissue with an area of reddened skin. A skin ulcer is often visible in the event of exposure to heat or cold, irritation, or a problem with blood circulation. They can also be caused due to a lack of mobility, which causes prolonged pressure on the tissues. This stress in the blood circulation is transformed to a skin ulcer, commonly known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers.Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelso; Abbas, Abul (2004) Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease (7th ed.).

Led Zeppelin, released on 29 October 1990, is a boxed set of the English rock group Led Zeppelin's popular songs digitally remastered, on six vinyl albums, four compact discs, and four cassette formats. Compilation and remastering of the tracks took place in New York during early to mid-1990. A 30-page booklet was included for the vinyl and CD releases.
This boxed set contains two previously unreleased tracks and a new mix. "Travelling Riverside Blues" was recorded on 24 June 1969 at the BBC Maida Vale Studio. "White Summer" was recorded at the Playhouse Theatre, London on 27 June 1969. The "Moby Dick"/"Bonzo's Montreux" mix took place at the Atlantic Synclavier Suite in New York, in May 1990.
To differentiate this release from the future Remasters box sets, some world recording industry associations have listed this under the title The Complete Collection (not to be confused with the later 1993 release The Complete Studio Recordings). 1993 also saw the release of Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2, which compiled all of the band's remaining studio tracks not included on the first boxed set.
In an interview he gave in January 2010, Page made reference to the Boxed Set:
 Oh, I'm now fully aware of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My awareness was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.Jonathan Wingate, Interview: Guitarist Jimmy Page, Scotsman.com, 5 January 2010.

A mouth ulcer (also termed an oral ulcer, or a mucosal ulcer) is an ulcer that occurs on the mucous membrane of the oral cavity. More plainly, a mouth ulcer is a sore or open lesion in the mouth.[tpl]cite web|last=Vorvick LJ, Zieve D.|title=Mouth ulcers on MedlinePlus|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001448.htm|publisher=A.D.A.M., Inc|accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl] Mouth ulcers are very common, occurring in association with many diseases and by many different mechanisms, but usually there is no serious underlying cause. The two most common causes of oral ulceration are local trauma (e.g. rubbing from a sharp edge on a filling) and aphthous stomatitis ("canker sores"), a condition characterized by recurrent formation of oral ulcers for largely unknown reasons. Mouth ulcers often cause pain and discomfort, and may alter the person's choice of food while healing occurs (e.g. avoiding acidic or spicy foods and beverages). They may occur singly or multiple ulcers may occur at the same time (a "crop" of ulcers). Once formed, the ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection. Rarely, a mouth ulcer that does not heal for many weeks may be a sign of oral cancer.

[[Transaction log]]

CATEGORIES: Database management systems, Transaction processing

In the field of databases in computer science, a transaction log (also transaction journal, database log, binary log or audit trail) is a history of actions executed by a database management system to guarantee ACID properties over crashes or hardware failures.  Physically, a log is a file of updates done to the database, stored in stable storage.
If, after a start, the database is found in an inconsistent state or not been shut down properly, the database management system reviews the database logs for uncommitted transactions and rolls back the changes made by these transactions.  Additionally, all transactions that are already committed but whose changes were not yet materialized in the database are re-applied.  Both are done to ensure atomicity and durability of transactions.
This term is not to be confused with other, human-readable logs that a database management system usually provides.

[[Elimination theory]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic geometry, Computer algebra

In commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, elimination theory is the classical name for algorithmic approaches to eliminating some variables between polynomials of several variables.
The linear case would now routinely be handled by Gaussian elimination, rather than the theoretical solution provided by Cramer's rule. In the same way, computational techniques for elimination can in practice be based on Gröbner basis methods. There is however older literature on types of eliminant, including resultants to find common roots of polynomials, discriminants and so on. In particular the discriminant appears in invariant theory, and is often constructed as the invariant of either a curve or an n-ary k-ic form. Whilst discriminants are always constructed resultants, the variety of constructions and their meaning tends to vary. A modern and systematic version of theory of the discriminant has been developed by Gelfand and coworkers.  Some of the systematic methods have a homological basis, that can be made explicit, as in Hilbert's theorem on syzygies. This field is at least as old as Bézout's theorem.
The historical development of commutative algebra, which was initially called ideal theory, is closely linked to concepts in elimination theory: ideas of Kronecker, who wrote a major paper on the subject, were adapted by Hilbert and effectively 'linearised' while dropping the explicit constructive content. The process continued over many decades: the work of F.S. Macaulay who gave his name to Cohen–Macaulay modules was motivated by elimination.
There is also a logical content to elimination theory, as seen in the Boolean satisfiability problem. In the worst case it is presumably hard to eliminate variables computationally. "Quantifier elimination" is a term used in mathematical logic to explain that, in some theories, every formula is equivalent with a formula without quantifier. This is the case of the theory of the polynomials over an algebraically closed field, and "elimination theory" may be viewed as the theory of the methods making quantifier elimination effective (algorithmic) in this case. Quantifier elimination over the reals is another example, which is fundamental in computational algebraic geometry.

[[Buoyancy]]

CATEGORIES: Force, Fluid mechanics, Buoyancy

In science, buoyancy [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|.|ə|n|s|i[/tpl] is an upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus a column of fluid, or an object submerged in the fluid, experiences greater pressure at the bottom of the column than at the top. This difference in pressure results in a net force that tends to accelerate an object upwards. The magnitude of that force is proportional to the difference in the pressure between the top and the bottom of the column, and (as explained by Archimedes' principle) is also equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the column, i.e. the displaced fluid. For this reason, an object whose density is greater than that of the fluid in which it is submerged tends to sink. If the object is either less dense than the liquid or is shaped appropriately (as in a boat), the force can keep the object afloat. This can occur only in a reference frame which either has a gravitational field or is accelerating due to a force other than gravity defining a "downward" direction (that is, a non-inertial reference frame). In a situation of fluid statics, the net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body.Note: In the absence of surface tension, the mass of fluid displaced is equal to the submerged volume multiplied by the fluid density. High repulsive surface tension will cause the body to float higher than expected, though the same total volume will be displaced, but at a greater distance from the object. Where there is doubt about the meaning of "volume of fluid displaced", this should be interpreted as the overflow from a full container when the object is floated in it, or as the volume of the object below the average level of the fluid.
The center of buoyancy of an object is the centroid of the displaced volume of fluid.

CATEGORIES: Lexical semantics

Meronymy (from Greek μέρος meros, "part" and  ὄνομα onoma, "name") is a semantic relation used in linguistics. A meronym denotes a constituent part of, or a member of something.  That is,
For example, "finger" is a meronym of "hand" because a finger is part of a hand.  Similarly, "wheels" is a meronym of "automobile". 
Meronymy is the opposite of holonymy. A closely related concept is that of mereology, which specifically deals with part/whole relations and is used in logic. It is formally expressed in terms of first-order logic. A meronymy can also be considered a partial order. 
A meronym means part of a whole. A word denoting a subset of what another word denotes is a hyponym.
In knowledge representation languages, meronymy is often expressed as "part-of".

[[Ēostre]]

CATEGORIES: English goddesses, Germanic deities, Quarter days

Ēostre or Ostara ([tpl]lang-ang|Ēastre[/tpl], Northumbrian dialect Ēostre; [tpl]lang-goh|*Ôstara[/tpl]) is a Germanic divinity who, by way of the Germanic month bearing her name (Northumbrian: Ēosturmōnaþ; West Saxon: Ēastermōnaþ; Old High German: Ôstarmânoth), is the namesake of the festival of Easter. Ēostre is attested solely by Bede in his 8th-century work The Reckoning of Time, where Bede states that during Ēosturmōnaþ (the equivalent of April), pagan Anglo-Saxons had held feasts in Eostre's honor, but that this tradition had died out by his time, replaced by the Christian Paschal month, a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.
By way of linguistic reconstruction, the matter of a goddess called *Austrō in the Proto-Germanic language has been examined in detail since the foundation of Germanic philology in the 19th century by scholar Jacob Grimm and others. As the Germanic languages descend from Proto-Indo-European (PIE), linguists have traced the name to a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn *H₂ewsṓs (→ *Ausṓs), from which descends the Common Germanic divinity from whom Ēostre and Ostara are held to descend. Scholars have linked the goddess' name to a variety of Germanic personal names, a series of location names in England, over 150 2nd century BCE matronae Austriahenae – inscriptions discovered in Germany, and have debated whether or not Eostre is an invention of Bede's. Theories connecting Ēostre with records of Germanic Easter customs, including hares and eggs, have been proposed.
Ēostre and Ostara are sometimes referenced in modern popular culture and are venerated in some forms of Germanic neopaganism.

In Finnish mythology Otso, Ohto, Kontio, metsän kuningas (the king of the forest), and mesikämmen (honeypaws) are some of the many rarely uttered circumlocutory epithets for the spirit that was never directly named. Generally, the spirit of the bear was referred to as friend, brother, uncle, or forestcousin, or ways were thought up that would bypass the need to refer to the spirit at all, even indirectly.
Some sub-traditions considered the bear to be a relative who had fled the community and been transmogrified by the power of the forest.

Derived from stereoscopic photography, a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives (or computer-generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post-production), and special projection hardware and/or eyewear are used to provide the illusion of depth when viewing the film. 3D films are not limited to feature film theatrical releases; television broadcasts and direct-to-video films have also incorporated similar methods, especially since the advent of 3D television and Blu-ray 3D.
3D films have existed in some form since 1915, but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film, and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business. Nonetheless, 3D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema, and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high-end theaters and Disney themed-venues. 3D films became more and more successful throughout the 2000s, culminating in the unprecedented success of 3D presentations of Avatar in December 2009 and January 2010.

The Basin and Range Province is a vast physiographic region defined by a unique topographic expression. Basin and range topography is characterized by abrupt changes in elevation, alternating between narrow faulted mountain chains and flat arid valleys or basins. The region covers much of the western United States, extends into northwestern Mexico and is mostly desert, with numerous ecoregions. The physiography of the province is the result of tectonic extension that began around 17 Ma (million years ago) in Early Miocene time.
The numerous ranges within the Province in the United States are collectively referred to as the Great Basin Ranges, although many are not actually in the Great Basin. Major ranges include the Snake Range, the Panamint Range, the White Mountains, the Sandia Mountains, and the San Francisco Peaks.
Depending on the various geographical definitions of the Province, the highest point of the Province is either Mount Whitney, Nevado de Toluca, or Pico de Orizaba, all of which are located at the boundary of the Province and belong to other geologic regions as well. The highest point fully within the Province is White Mountain Peak in California, while the lowest point is Badwater Basin in Death Valley.
Clarence Dutton famously compared the many narrow parallel mountain ranges that distinguish the unique topography of the Basin and Range to an "army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico", which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region.Reynolds, D., & Christensen, J. (2001). Nevada. Portland, Or: Graphic Arts Center Pub. The Basin and Range province should not be confused with The Great Basin, which is a sub-section of the greater Basin and Range physiographic region defined by its unique hydrological characteristics (internal drainage).

Tulare Lake, named Laguna de Tache by the Spanish, is a freshwater dry lake with residual wetlands and marshes in southern San Joaquin Valley, California, United States. After Lake Cahuilla disappeared in the 17th century, Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River and the second largest freshwater lake entirely in the United States, based upon surface area. The lake dried up after its tributary rivers were diverted for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses.
The lake was named for the tule rush (Schoenoplectus acutus)  that lined the marshes and sloughs of its shores.  The lake was part of a [tpl]convert|13670|mi2|km2|adj=on[/tpl] partially endorheic basin, at the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, where it received water from the Kern, Tule and Kaweah Rivers, as well as from southern distributaries of the Kings.  It was separated from the rest of the San Joaquin Valley by tectonic subsidence and alluvial fans extending out from Los Gatos Creek in the Coast Ranges and the Kings River in the Sierra Nevada.  Above a threshold elevation of 207 to 210 feet, it overflowed into the San Joaquin River.  This happened in 19 of 29 years from 1850 to 1878.  No overflows occurred after 1878 due to increasing diversions of tributary waters for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses, and by 1899, the lake was dry except for residual wetlands and occasional floods.
Tulare Lake was the largest of several similar lakes in its lower basin.  Most of the Kern River's flow first went into Kern Lake and Buena Vista Lake via the Kern River and Kern River Slough southwest and south of the site of Bakersfield.  If they overflowed, it was through the Kern River channel northwest through tule marshland and Goose Lake, into Tulare Lake.

[[Alluvial fan]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentology, Fluvial landforms, Geography terminology

An alluvial fan is a fan- or cone-shaped deposit of sediment crossed and built up by streams. If a fan is built up by  debris flows it is properly called a debris cone or colluvial fan. These flows come from a single point source at the apex of the fan, and over time move to occupy many positions on the fan surface. Fans are typically found where a canyon draining from mountainous terrain emerges out onto a flatter plain, and especially along fault-bounded mountain fronts.
A convergence of neighboring alluvial fans into a single apron of deposits against a slope is called a bajada, or compound alluvial fan.American Geological Institute. Dictionary of Geological Terms. New York: Dolphin Books, 1962.

[[Elastic-rebound theory]]

CATEGORIES: Plate tectonics, 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Seismology measurement

The elastic rebound theory is an explanation for how energy is spread during earthquakes. As rocks on opposite sides of a fault are subjected to force and shift, they accumulate energy and slowly deform until their internal strength is exceeded. At that time, a sudden movement occurs along the fault, releasing the accumulated energy, and the rocks snap back to their original undeformed shape.
In geology, the elastic rebound theory was the first theory to satisfactorily explain earthquakes. Previously it was thought that ruptures of the surface were the result of strong ground shaking rather than the converse suggested by this theory.
Ancient cultural explanations of earthquakes were often along the lines of the mythical Japanese Namazu:  A giant catfish with the islands of Japan on his back. A demigod, or daimyojin, holds a heavy stone over his head to keep him from moving. Once in a while the daimyojin is distracted so Namazu moves and the Earth trembles.

Freydís Eiríksdóttir was a daughter of Erik the Red (as in her patronym) who was associated with the Norse exploration of North America. The only medieval sources which mention Freydís are the two Vinland sagas, believed to be composed in the 13th century but purporting to describe events around 1000. They offer widely differing accounts, though in both Freydís appears as a strong-willed woman. Eiríks saga rauða describes her as a half-sister of Leif Eiríksson but according to Grœnlendinga saga she was a full sister.

TriMet, more formally known as the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, is a public agency that operates mass transit in a region that spans most of the Portland metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Oregon. Created in 1969 by the Oregon legislature, the district replaced five private bus companies that operated in the three counties; Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas. TriMet started operating a light rail system named MAX in 1986, and opened new lines in 1998 (Westside), 2001 (Airport), 2004 (Interstate Ave.), and 2009 (Clackamas), as well as a commuter rail line in 2009. It also operates the City of Portland-owned Portland Streetcar system.
In addition to rail lines, TriMet provides the region's bus system, as well as LIFT paratransit service. There are 625 buses in TriMet's fleet that operate on 79 routes. In Fiscal Year 2009, the entire system averaged almost 325,000 rides per weekday and operates buses and trains between the hours of approximately 5 a.m. and 2 a.m. with no "night owl" service. TriMet's annual revenues total $404 million, with over half of the revenues coming from a district-wide payroll tax.[tpl]cite web|url=http://trimet.org/pdfs/publications/TriMet_2008_Annual_Report.pdf|title=2008 Annual Report|date=October 6, 2008|publisher=TriMet|pages=9|accessdate=2009-10-09[/tpl] The district is overseen by a seven-person board of governors appointed by the state's governor.

Forgiveness is the intentional and voluntary process by which a victim undergoes a change in feelings and attitude regarding an offense, lets go of negative emotions such as vengefulness, with an increased ability to wish the offender well.[tpl]cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.apa.org/international/resources/forgiveness.pdf | title = American Psychological Association.

In certain contexts, forgiveness is a legal term for absolving or giving up all claims on account of debt, loan, obligation or other claims.DEBT FORGIVENESS OECD, Glossary of Statistical Terms (2001)Loan Forgiveness Glossary, US Department of Education
As a psychological concept and virtue, the benefits of forgiveness have been explored in religious thought, the social sciences and medicine. Forgiveness may be considered simply in terms of the person who forgives including forgiving themselves, in terms of the person forgiven or in terms of the relationship between the forgiver and the person forgiven. In most contexts, forgiveness is granted without any expectation of restorative justice, and without any response on the part of the offender (for example, one may forgive a person who is incommunicado or dead). In practical terms, it may be necessary for the offender to offer some form of acknowledgment, an apology, or even just ask for forgiveness, in order for the wronged person to believe himself able to forgive.
Most world religions include teachings on the nature of forgiveness, and many of these teachings provide an underlying basis for many varying modern day traditions and practices of forgiveness. Some religious doctrines or philosophies place greater emphasis on the need for humans to find some sort of divine forgiveness for their own shortcomings, others place greater emphasis on the need for humans to practice forgiveness of one another, yet others make little or no distinction between human and divine forgiveness.

[[Prediction]]
CATEGORIES: Prediction, Futurology, Scientific method, Technical factors of astrology

A prediction (Latin præ-, "before," and dicere, "to say") or forecast is a statement about the way things will happen in the future, often but not always based on experience or knowledge. While there is much overlap between prediction and forecast, a prediction may be a statement that some outcome is expected, while a forecast is more specific, and may cover a range of possible outcomes.
Although guaranteed information about the future is in many cases impossible, prediction is necessary to allow plans to be made about possible developments; Howard H. Stevenson writes that prediction in business "...  is at least two things: Important and hard."Stevenson, Howard, ed. Do lunch or be lunch. Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1998

CATEGORIES: Data analysis, Statistical forecasting, Time series analysis, Supply chain management terms, Supply chain analytics

Forecasting is the process of making statements about events whose actual outcomes (typically) have not yet been observed. A commonplace example might be estimation of some variable of interest at some specified future date.  Prediction is a similar, but more general term. Both might refer to formal statistical methods employing time series, cross-sectional or longitudinal data, or alternatively to less formal judgmental methods.  Usage can differ between areas of application: for example, in hydrology, the terms "forecast" and "forecasting" are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times, while the term "prediction" is used for more general estimates, such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period. 
Risk and uncertainty are central to forecasting and prediction; it is generally considered good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attaching to forecasts. In any case, the data must be up to date in order for the forecast to be as accurate as possible.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/index.php/faq| title=Answers to Frequently Asked Questions| author=Scott Armstrong, Fred Collopy, Andreas Graefe and Kesten C.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ([tpl]lang-bn|শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান[/tpl] Shekh Mujibur Rôhman), (17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975) was a Bengali nationalist politician and statesman. He was the paramount independence leader of Bangladesh and is regarded as the founding father of the nation.The founder of Bangladesh. Archive.thedailystar.net (2010-08-15). Retrieved on 2013-07-12. He headed the Awami League and was the first President of Bangladesh during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and later became Prime Minister in independent Bangladesh. He is popularly referred to as Sheikh Mujib (shortened as Mujib or Mujibur, not Rahman), with the honorary title of Bangabandhu (বঙ্গবন্ধু Bôngobondhu, "Friend of Bengal"). His eldest daughter, Sheikh Hasina, is the present leader of the Awami League and the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh.
As a student political leader, Mujib rose in Bengali politics and within ranks of the Awami League. An advocate of socialism, he became popular for his opposition to the ethnic and institutional discrimination against Bengalis, who comprised the majority of Pakistan's population.[tpl]cite web|author=Tahir Mehdi |url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/770315/the-crow-is-white-bengal-is-pakistan |title=The crow is white, Bengal is Pakistan - DAWN.COM |publisher=Beta.dawn.com |date=2012-12-10 |accessdate=2014-02-05[/tpl] He demanded increased provincial autonomy, and strongly opposed the military rule of Field Marshall Ayub Khan.
At the heightening of sectional tensions, Mujib outlined a 6-point autonomy plan. He was tried in 1968 for allegedly conspiring with the Indian government but was acquitted. Despite leading his party to a major victory in the 1970 elections, Mujib was not invited to form the government.
With his charismatic and forceful oratory, Mujib inspired millions across East Pakistan to engage in the struggle for self-determination and independence.
On March 26, 1971, he was arrested by the Pakistan Army in the early hours of Operation Searchlight. During his nine-month detention, guerrilla war erupted between Pakistan Army and Bengali nationalists. An all-out war between the Pakistan Army and Bangladesh-India Allied Forces led to the liberation of Bangladesh and its founding as an independent nation in 1971.
After his release, Mujib assumed office as a provisional president, and later prime minister. Even as a constitution was adopted that proclaimed a secular democracy, Mujib struggled to address the challenges of intense poverty and unemployment in the country, coupled with rampant corruption. In the aftermath of the 1974 famineBook Review: S. A. Karim, Sheikh Mujib: Triumph and Tragedy[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl], Weekly Holiday and amidst rising political agitation, he banned other political parties and most of the newspapers, except for four that were owned by the state. He established a one-party state. Seven months later, Mujib was assassinated by a group of junior army officers on August 15, 1975, along with most of his family. After the coup, a military government was established.

The Complete Studio Recordings is a ten compact disc box set by the English rock group Led Zeppelin, released by Atlantic Records on 24 September 1993. It contains all nine of the original Led Zeppelin studio albums digitally remastered, and an expanded version of Coda. The albums are placed in chronological order with the exception of Presence which appears between Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti. The intention was to have the latter in one two-disc-sleeve.[tpl]cite book | author= Lewis, Dave| title=Led Zeppelin: The Complete Guide to Their Music| edition=1st | location=London| publisher= Omnibus Press | year=2004| page=74| chapter=The Complete Studio Recordings| isbn=1-84449-141-2[/tpl]
The set's version of Coda included some of the previously unreleased tracks that had surfaced on the box set series: "Baby Come On Home", "Travelling Riverside Blues", "White Summer"/"Black Mountain Side", and "Hey Hey What Can I Do". In 2007, when the Led Zeppelin catalog was released to digital stores, the expanded tracklist for Coda was used, but omitted "Travelling Riverside Blues" because of its inclusion with BBC Sessions.
The set also includes a booklet featuring an extended essay by rock journalist Cameron Crowe and photos of the band.
The album cover depicts the inside structure of a zeppelin.
This title has been discontinued just prior to the launch of Mothership, and is now superseded by the Definitive Collection Mini LP Replica CD Boxset, which was released in September 2008.

[[Žatec]]

CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in the Czech Republic, Louny District

Žatec ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈʒatɛts[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-de|Saaz[/tpl]) is an old town in the Czech Republic, in Louny District, Ústí nad Labem Region. It has a population of 19,813 (2006).
The earliest historical reference to Sacz is in the Latin chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg of 1004. During the 11th century it belonged to the Vršovci - a powerful Czech aristocratic family. A coat-of-arms was given to the inhabitants by Vladislav II for their courage during the storming of Milan, and the place is mentioned as a royal town under Otakar II. From the outbreak of the Hussite Wars to the Thirty Years' War, the town was Hussite or Protestant, but after the Battle of White Mountain (1620) the greater part of the Czech inhabitants left the town, which remained German and Roman Catholic until 1945, when the Germans were transferred to Germany.
Žatec lies on the Ohře River (Eger), which is spanned here by a suspension bridge, 64 m (210 ft) long, which is the oldest of its kind in Bohemia, having been constructed in 1826. It possesses several ancient churches, of which one is said to date from 1206, and a town hall built in 1559. 
Žatec became famous for an over-700-year-long tradition of growing Saaz noble hops used by several breweries. Žatec produces its own beer and hosts 'Dočesná', its (hops related) harvest festival every year on the town square.
During and after the Second World War a Messerschmitt production facility and air base for testing aircraft, including new jet fighters, was located close to the town. In 1948 the production facility continued to produce the Avia S-199, a version of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft which were sold to Israel, with the initial training for the Israeli pilots provided at the air base. Many other military supplies were flown to Israel from the air base, which helped the new state to secure its independence.

[[Hawke Bay]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of the Hawke's Bay Region, Bays of New Zealand

Hawke Bay is a large bay on the eastern coast of the North Island of New Zealand.  It stretches from the Mahia Peninsula in the northeast to Cape Kidnappers in the southwest, a distance of some 100 kilometres.
Captain James Cook, sailing in HM Bark Endeavour, sailed into the bay on 12 October 1769.  After exploring it, he named it for Sir Edward Hawke, First Lord of the Admiralty on 15 October 1769, describing it as some 13 leagues (about 40 miles) across.
This area of the New Zealand coast is subject to tectonic uplift, with the land being raised out of the sea. For this reason, the coastal land in this area has significant marine deposits, with both marine and land dinosaur fossils having been found inland. The Napier earthquake of 3 February 1931 resulted in several parts of the seabed close to the city of Napier being raised above sea level.
Because the central mountain ranges come close to the coast at the north end of the bay, much of the bay's northerly coastline has deeply eroded tablelands that end in steep seaside cliffs which descend to narrow beaches.
The town of Wairoa lies to the north end of the bay, at the mouth of the Wairoa River and its flood plain, while the port city of Napier lies on the coast and near the southern end of the bay sits the city of Hastings, on the edge of another flat river flood plain. The Hawke's Bay Region, which is distinct from the bay itself, lies on the coastal land around the bay and also in the hinterland to the south.
The bay itself is Hawke Bay, whereas the region which surrounds it bears the bay's former name, Hawke's Bay.

[[Kazakhstani tenge]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Kazakhstan, Currencies of Kazakhstan, 1993 introductions

The tenge ([tpl]lang-kz|теңге, teñge[/tpl]) is the currency of Kazakhstan. It is divided into 100 tïın (тиын, also transliterated as tiyin or tijin). It was introduced on 15 November 1993 to replace the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 tenge = 500 rubles. The ISO-4217 code is KZT.
The word tenge in the Kazakh and most other Turkic languages means a set of scales (cf the old Uzbek tenga or the Tajik borrowed term tanga). The origin of the word is the Turkic teŋ- which means being equal, balance. The name of this currency is thus similar to the lira, pound and peso. The name of the currency is related to the Russian word for money [tpl]lang-ru|деньги / den'gi[/tpl], which was borrowed from Turkic.

M. Witmark & Sons was a leading publisher of sheet music for the United States "Tin Pan Alley" music industry.
The firm of Marcus Witmark & Sons was established in New York City in 1886. The father, Marcus Witmark, was the legal head of the company; but from the beginning it was run by his sons Isidore, Julius, and Jay, who were under legal age when the company started (ranging in age from 17 to 14 years old). They started out publishing their own compositions. They were adept at plugging songs, and within a few years were publishing the works of such composers as Victor Herbert, George M. Cohan, Ben Harney and John Walter Bratton. 
Witmark originated the practice of giving free "professional copies" of their new music to famous and established singers and bands, which proved so successful an advertising method that it was copied by the rest of the music publishers.
When the International Copyright Law was passed in 1891, Witmark pioneered publishing versions of British music in the United States and arranging for American hits to be published in the UK.

[[Summation]]

CATEGORIES: Arithmetic, Mathematical notation

Summation is the operation of adding a sequence of numbers; the result is their sum or total. If numbers are added sequentially from left to right, any intermediate result is a partial sum, prefix sum, or running total of the summation. The numbers to be summed (called addends, or sometimes summands) may be integers, rational numbers, real numbers, or complex numbers. Besides numbers, other types of values can be added as well: vectors, matrices, polynomials and, in general, elements of any additive group (or even monoid). For finite sequences of such elements, summation always produces a well-defined sum (possibly by virtue of the convention for empty sums).
The summation of an infinite sequence of values is called a series. A value of such a series may often be defined, by means of a limit (although sometimes the value may be infinite, and often no value results at all). Another notion involving limits of finite sums is integration. The term summation has a special meaning related to extrapolation in the context of divergent series.
The summation of the sequence 1, 2, 4, 2 is an expression whose value is the sum of each of the members of the sequence. In the example, [tpl]nowrap|1 + 2 + 4 + 2[/tpl] = 9. Since addition is associative the value does not depend on how the additions are grouped, for instance [tpl]nowrap|(1 + 2) + (4 + 2)[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|1 + ((2 + 4) + 2)[/tpl] both have the value 9; therefore, parentheses are usually omitted in repeated additions. Addition is also commutative, so permuting the terms of a finite sequence does not change its sum (for infinite summations this property may fail; see absolute convergence for conditions under which it still holds).
There is no special notation for the summation of such explicit sequences, as the corresponding repeated addition expression will do. There is only a slight difficulty if the sequence has fewer than two elements: the summation of a sequence of one term involves no plus sign (it is indistinguishable from the term itself) and the summation of the empty sequence cannot even be written down (but one can write its value "0" in its place). If, however, the terms of the sequence are given by a regular pattern, possibly of variable length, then a summation operator may be useful or even essential. For the summation of the sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to 100 one could use an addition expression involving an ellipsis to indicate the missing terms: [tpl]nowrap|1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 99 + 100[/tpl]. In this case the reader easily guesses the pattern; however, for more complicated patterns, one needs to be precise about the rule used to find successive terms, which can be achieved by using the summation operator "Σ". Using this sigma notation the above summation is written as:
The value of this summation is 5050. It can be found without performing 99 additions, since it can be shown (for instance by mathematical induction) that
for all natural numbers n. More generally, formulae exist for many summations of terms following a regular pattern.
The term "indefinite summation" refers to the search for an inverse image of a given infinite sequence s of values for the forward difference operator, in other words for a sequence, called antidifference of s, whose finite differences are given by s. By contrast, summation as discussed in this article is called "definite summation".
When it is necessary to clarify that numbers are added with their signs, the term algebraic sumOxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. - algebraic (esp. of a sum): taken with consideration of the sign (plus or minus) of each term. is used. For example, in electric circuit theory Kirchhoff's circuit laws consider the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point, assigning opposite signs to currents flowing in and out of the node.

CATEGORIES: Stanzaic form

Ottava rima is a rhyming stanza form of Italian origin. Originally used for long poems on heroic themes, it later came to be popular in the writing of mock-heroic works. Its earliest known use is in the writings of Giovanni Boccaccio.
The ottava rima stanza in English consists of eight iambic lines, usually iambic pentameters. Each stanza consists of three alternate rhymes and one double rhyme, following the a-b-a-b-a-b-c-c pattern. The form is similar to the older Sicilian octave, but evolved separately and is unrelated. The Sicilian octave is derived from the medieval strambotto and was a crucial step in the development of the sonnet, whereas the ottava rima is related to the canzone, a stanza form.

Phenolphthalein [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|f|iː|n|ɒ|l|f|ˈ|θ|eɪ|l|iː|n[/tpl][tpl]OED|phenolphthalein[/tpl] is a chemical compound with the formula C20H14O4 and is often written as "HIn" or "phph" in shorthand notation. Often used in titrations, it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions. If the concentration of indicator is particularly strong, it can appear purple.
In strongly basic solutions, phenolphthalein's pink color undergoes a rather slow fading reaction and becomes colorless again. The molecule has four forms:
The rather slow fading reaction that produces the colorless InOH3− ion is sometimes used in classes for the study of reaction kinetics.
Phenolphthalein is insoluble in water and usually is dissolved in alcohols for use in experiments. It is a weak acid, which can lose H+ ions in solution. The phenolphthalein molecule is colorless, however, the phenolphthalein ion is pink. When a base is added to the phenolphthalein, the molecule [tpl]unicode|⇌[/tpl] ions' equilibrium shifts to the right, leading to more ionization as H+ ions are removed.

The Finnish War was fought between the Kingdom of Sweden and the Russian Empire from February 1808 to September 1809. As a result of the war, the eastern third of Sweden was established as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire. Other notable effects were the Swedish parliament's adoption of a new constitution and the establishment of the House of Bernadotte, the new Swedish royal house, in 1818.

[[Gettier problem]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical problems, Concepts in epistemology, Knowledge, Thought experiments, Epistemology, Thought experiments in philosophy

The Gettier problem is a philosophical question about whether a piece of information that happens to be true but that someone believes for invalid reasons, such as a faulty premise,  counts as knowledge. It is named after American philosopher Edmund Gettier, who wrote about the problem in a three-page paper published in 1963, called "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?". The paper refers to the concept of knowledge as justified true belief (JTB), credited to Plato. In the paper, Gettier proposed two scenarios where the three criteria (justification, truth, and belief) seemed to be met, but where the majority of readers would not have felt that the result was knowledge due to the element of luck involved.
The term is sometimes used to cover any one of a category of thought experiments in contemporary epistemology that seem to repudiate a definition of knowledge as justified true belief.
The responses to Gettier's paper have been numerous. While some rejected Gettier's examples, many sought to adjust the JTB account of knowledge to lessen the impact of both Gettier's own problems and other problems (collectively titled "Gettier problems") created in their mould. Since 1963, experiments have also been conducted to determine whether the instinctive reactions of those presented with a Gettier problem are uniform or display language or genetic biases.

[[Superhuman]]
CATEGORIES: Science fiction themes, Humans

A superhuman is a human with extraordinary and unusual capabilities enabling them to perform feats well beyond anything that an ordinary person could conceivably achieve, even through long-time training and development.
Superhuman can mean an improved human, for example, by genetic modification, cybernetic implants, nanotechnology, or as what humans might eventually evolve  into thousands or millions of years later into the distant future. Occasionally, it could mean an otherwise "normal" human with unusual super-abilities, such as psychic/psionic abilities, flying abilities, unimaginable strength or exceptional proficiency at something, far beyond the normal.
Superhuman can also mean something that is not human, but considered to be "superior" to humans in some ways. A robot that easily passed the Turing test, and could do some things humans cannot, could be considered superhuman. A very intelligent or strong alien could be considered superhuman. In its most basic sense it means anything beyond (typical) human capabilities, e.g. a tiger may be described as having "superhuman strength".

Kobe Bean Bryant (born August 23, 1978) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He entered the NBA directly from high school, and has played for the Lakers his entire career, winning five NBA championships. Bryant is a 16-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, and 12-time member of the All-Defensive team. [tpl]As of|March 2013[/tpl], he ranks third and fourth[tpl]cite web|author=Kelly Dwyer|title=Kobe Bryant passes Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth-leading scorer in NBA history|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/kobe-bryant-passes-wilt-chamberlain-become-fourth-leading-033539487--nba.html|work=Yahoo! Sports|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=March 31, 2013[/tpl] on the league's all-time postseason scoring and all-time regular season scoring lists, respectively.
Bryant enjoyed a successful high school basketball career at Lower Merion High School, where he was recognized as the top high school basketball player in the country. He declared his eligibility for the NBA Draft upon graduation, and was selected with the 13th overall pick in the 1996 NBA Draft by the Charlotte Hornets, then traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest.
Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers to three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002. A heated feud between the duo and a loss in the 2004 NBA Finals was followed by O'Neal's trade from the Lakers after the 2003–04 season. Following O'Neal's departure Bryant became the cornerstone of the Los Angeles Lakers franchise. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, setting numerous scoring records in the process. In 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto Raptors, the second most points scored in a single game in NBA history, second only to Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. He was awarded the regular season's Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 2008. After losing in the 2008 NBA Finals, Bryant led the Lakers to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, earning the NBA Finals MVP Award on both occasions.
At 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He is also the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. Since his second year in the league, Bryant has been selected to start every All-Star Game. He has won the All-Star MVP Award four times (2002, 2007, 2009, and 2011), tying him for the most All Star MVP Awards in NBA history. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won gold medals as a member of the USA national team. Sporting News and TNT named Bryant the top NBA player of the 2000s.
In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault after having sex with a hotel employee in Edwards, Colorado. In September 2004, prosecutors dropped the case after his accuser refused to testify. A civil suit was later filed and settled out of court.

In medicine (pulmonology), psittacosis — also known as parrot fever, and ornithosis — is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly Chlamydia psittaci) and contracted from parrots, such as macaws, cockatiels and budgerigars, and pigeons, sparrows, ducks, hens, gulls and many other species of bird. The incidence of infection in canaries and finches is believed to be lower than in psittacine birds.
In certain contexts, the word "psittacosis" is used when the disease is carried by any species of bird belonging to the Psittacidae family, whereas "ornithosis" is used when other birds carry the disease.[tpl]DorlandsDict|six/000075871|ornithosis[/tpl]

San Jose CyberRays was a professional soccer team that played in the Women's United Soccer Association. The team played at Spartan Stadium on the South Campus of San José State University in San Jose, California. Stars included U.S. National Team star Brandi Chastain, WUSA Goalkeeper of the Year LaKeysia Beene, and leading scorer Julie Murray. Other memorable CyberRays were Brazilians Sissi and Katia, Tisha Venturini (from the U.S. National Team), and "ironwoman" Thori Bryan, who played every minute of the first season. They were coached by Ian Sawyers, who received WUSA Coach of the Year honors in 2001.
The team won the WUSA title (known as the Founders Cup) for the league's inaugural season in 2001.  The CyberRays triumphed over the Atlanta Beat, in 4-2 shootout after double overtime of a 3-3 game. 
In 2002 the team changed its name from the Bay Area CyberRays to the San Jose CyberRays, and also gave their roster a facelift, allowing Murray to retire and trading for Pretinha from the Washington Freedom, who along with Katia and Sissi, gave the new attack a decidedly Brazilian flavor. The bold changes didn't have the desired effect, however, and the team finished out of the playoffs. One bright spot was the emergence of Katia, who scored 15 goals and broke Tiffeny Milbrett's record for most points in a season.
The CyberRays had high hopes for 2003, but an anemic offense (worst in the league in goals scored) hurt the team all year. The team remained in contention until the end of the season, but finished out of the playoffs for a second straight year.
But even bigger problems were brewing in the background, as the WUSA continued to struggle financially. The CyberRays folded on September 15, 2003, when the league announced it was suspending operations.

Admiral of the Fleet Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke KB, PC (21 February 1705 – 16 October 1781) was an officer of the Royal Navy. He is best remembered for his service during the Seven Years' War, particularly his victory over a French fleet at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759, preventing a French invasion of Britain. A number of Royal Navy warships were named after him, in commemoration of this. He had also won an earlier victory, the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747 which made his name. Hawke acquired a reputation as a "fighting officer" which allowed his career to prosper, despite him possessing a number of political enemies. He developed the concept of a Western Squadron, keeping an almost continuous blockade of the French coast throughout the war.
Hawke also served as First Lord of the Admiralty for five years between 1766 and 1771. In this post, he oversaw the mobilisation of the British navy during the 1770 Falklands Crisis.

Magnesium sulfate (or magnesium sulphate) is an inorganic salt (chemical compound) containing magnesium, sulfur and oxygen, with the formula MgSO4. It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O), commonly called Epsom salt, taking its name from a bitter saline spring in Epsom in Surrey, England, where the salt was produced from the springs that arise where the porous chalk of the North Downs meets non-porous London clay. The monohydrate, MgSO4·H2O is found as the mineral kieserite. The overall global annual usage in the mid 1970s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons, of which the majority as used in agriculture.Industrial Inorganic Chemistry, Karl Heinz Büchel, Hans-Heinrich Moretto, Dietmar Werner, John Wiley & Sons, 2d edition, 2000, ISBN 9783527613335
Anhydrous magnesium sulfate  is used as a drying agent. The anhydrous form is hygroscopic (readily absorbs water from the air) and is therefore difficult to weigh accurately; the hydrate is often preferred when preparing solutions (for example, in medical preparations). Epsom salt has been traditionally used as a component of bath salts. Epsom salt can also be used as a beauty product.  Athletes use it to soothe sore muscles, while gardeners use it to improve crops.  It has a variety of other uses. Epsom Salts are also effective in the removal of sub-cutaneous slivers.

[[Earwig]]

CATEGORIES: Earwigs

Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera and are found throughout the Americas, Africa, Eurasia, Australia and New Zealand. With about 2,000 species[tpl]cite journal| author=Zhang, Z.-Q.| title=Phylum Arthropoda von Siebold, 1848 In: Zhang, Z.-Q. (Ed.) Animal biodiversity: An outline of higher-level classification and survey of taxonomic richness | journal=Zootaxa| volume=3148| year=2011| pages=99–103| url=http://mapress.com/zootaxa/2011/f/zt03148p103.pdf[/tpl] in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings, hence the scientific order name, "skin wings." Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs rarely use their flying ability.
Earwigs are nocturnal; they often hide in small, moist crevices during the day, and are active at night, feeding on a wide variety of insects and plants. Damage to foliage, flowers, and various crops is commonly blamed on earwigs, especially the common earwig Forficula auricularia.
Earwigs have five molts in the year before they become adults. Many earwig species display maternal care, which is uncommon among insects. Female earwigs may care for their eggs, and even after they have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show.
Some earwig specimen fossils are in the extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera, the former dating to the Late Triassic and the latter to the Middle Jurassic. Many orders of insect have been theorized to be closely related to earwigs, though the icebugs of Grylloblattaria are most likely.

[[Great Highland Bagpipe]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Scotland, Bagpipes, Scottish musical instruments

The Great Highland bagpipe ([tpl]lang-gd|a' phìob mhòr[/tpl]) is a type of bagpipe native to Scotland. It has achieved widespread recognition through its usage in the British military and in pipe bands throughout the world.
The bagpipe is first attested in Scotland around 1400 AD, having previously appeared in European artwork in Spain in the 13th century. The earliest references to bagpipes in Scotland are in a military context, and it is in that context that the Great Highland bagpipe became established in the British military and achieved the widespread prominence it enjoys today, whereas other bagpipe traditions throughout Europe, ranging from Portugal to Russia, almost universally went into decline by the late 19th and early 20th century.
Though widely famous for its role in military and civilian pipe bands, the Great Highland bagpipe is also used for a solo virtuosic style called piobaireachd, or simply pibroch.

Edward Irving "Ed" Koch ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|tʃ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|KOTCH|'[/tpl]; December 12, 1924 – February 1, 2013) was an American lawyer, politician, political commentator, movie critic and reality television arbitrator. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1969 to 1977 and three terms as mayor of New York City, which he led from fiscal insolvency to economic boom, from 1978 to 1989.
Koch was a lifelong Democrat who described himself as a "liberal with sanity". The author of an ambitious public housing renewal program in his later years as mayor, he began by cutting spending and taxes and cutting 7,000 from the city payroll after the expansive Lindsay and Beame administrations. As a congressman and after his terms as mayor he was a hawkish supporter of Israel. He crossed party lines to endorse Rudy Giuliani for mayor in 1993, Michael Bloomberg in 2001, and President George W. Bush in 2004.
A  popular figure, he rode the New York City Subways and stood at street corners greeting passersby with the slogan "How'm I doin'?"  His private life was enigmatic, with speculation about his sexuality, which he rebuffed as nobody's business but his own; he had no children, and no publicly acknowledged romantic relationships, but declared his heterosexuality after his retirement. He did not enjoy, however, the same uncontested popularity among some gay New Yorkers, as many were critical of his response to the beginnings of the AIDS crisis in 1981, seeing his inaction as a result of what they saw as his "closeted lifestyle".Andy Humm, gaycitynews.com/ed-koch-12-years-as-mayor-a-lifetime-in-the-closet/ Ed Koch: 12 Years as Mayor, A Lifetime in the Closet, Gay City News, February 3, 2013 . Koch won re-election in 1981 with 75 percent, the first New York mayor to win endorsement on both the Democratic and Republican party tickets.  He won his second re-election with 78 percent of the vote.  His third term was fraught with scandal regarding political associates, although it never touched him personally, and with racial tensions including the murder of Yusuf Hawkins a month before a fourth primary which he lost in a close race to New York City's first black mayor, David Dinkins.
In political retirement he was a radio show host, author, and political gadfly. He was also an arbitrator ("judge") on the television court show The People's Court for two seasons from 1997 to 1999. He died on February 1, 2013, of congestive heart failure.

After retiring as a player, he served as an assistant coach for the Tampa Bay Lightning and New Jersey Devils prior to joining the Capitals as their head coach for two seasons between 2012 and 2014.
As a college player, Oates was a standout forward for the RPI Engineers. He set single-season school records for assists and points and was named an Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) all-star and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American in both 1984 and 1985. He was named a tournament all-star in helping RPI win the 1985 national championship, and in 1990–91, the NHL included him in its Second All-Star Team; he played in five All-Star Games.  He holds the record for most points all-time of any NHL player who also played NCAA Hockey.

After the Jacobite Rising of 1715 ended it was evident that the most effective supporters of the Jacobites were Scottish clans in the Scottish Highlands and the Disarming Act attempted to remove this threat. 
"An act for the more effectual securing the peace of the highlands in Scotland" was passed by the Parliament of Great Britain, coming into effect on November 1, 1716 which outlawed anyone in defined parts of Scotland from having "in his or their custody, use, or bear, broad sword or target, poignard, whinger, or durk, side pistol, gun, or other warlike weapon" unless authorised. 
This act proved ineffectual and in 1725 An act for the more effectual disarming the highlands in that part of Great Britain called Scotland; and for the better securing the peace and quiet of that part of the kingdom was passed and more effectively enforced by Major-General George Wade.  Wade succeeded in confiscating a significant number of useful weapons, though the Highlanders still managed to hide many weapons for future use. 
The success of Wade's efforts was shown by the rough assortment of weapons used by the Highlanders when Bonnie Prince Charlie raised the Forty-Five Rising, but the Jacobites' overwhelming victory at the Battle of Prestonpans provided them with a good supply of government firelocks and bayonets left by the fleeing Redcoats.
After that Jacobite Rising had been defeated the provisions of the Disarming Act were strengthened in the new Act of Proscription.

The sea has a complex and diverse undersea relief. The floor is formed into a structural basin by a series of geologic faults and fracture zones. Island arcs, which are actually extended ridges protruding above the ocean surface due to plate tectonic activity in the area, enclose the Philippine Sea to the north, east and south. The Philippine archipelago, Ryukyu Islands, and the Marianas are examples. Another prominent feature of the Philippine Sea is the presence of deep sea trenches, among them the Philippine Trench and the Mariana Trench, containing the deepest point on the planet.

[[Diagonalizable matrix]]

CATEGORIES: Matrices

In linear algebra, a square matrix A is called diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix, i.e., if there exists an invertible matrix P such that P−1AP is a diagonal matrix. If V is a finite-dimensional vector space, then a linear map T : V → V is called diagonalizable if there exists an ordered basis of V with respect to which T is represented by a diagonal matrix. Diagonalization is the process of finding a corresponding diagonal matrix for a diagonalizable matrix or linear map.Horn & Johnson 1985 A square matrix which is not diagonalizable is called defective.
Diagonalizable matrices and maps are of interest because diagonal matrices are especially easy to handle: their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known and one can raise a diagonal matrix to a power by simply raising the diagonal entries to that same power. Geometrically, a diagonalizable matrix is an inhomogeneous dilation (or anisotropic scaling) — it scales the space, as does a homogeneous dilation, but by a different factor in each direction, determined by the scale factors on each axis (diagonal entries).

[[Pipe band]]

CATEGORIES: Pipe bands, Bagpiping, Highland games, Scottish music

A pipe band is a musical ensemble consisting of pipers and drummers. The term used by military pipe bands, pipes and drums, is also common. 
The most common form of pipe band, the Scottish pipe band, consists of a section of pipers (playing the Great Highland Bagpipe), a section of snare drummers (often referred to as 'side drummers'), several tenor drummers and usually one, though occasionally two, bass drummers. The entire drum section is known collectively as the drum corps. The tenor drummers and bass drummer are referred to collectively as the 'bass section' (or in North America as the 'midsection'). The band follows the direction of the pipe major; when on parade the band may be led by a drum major, who directs the band with a mace. Standard instrumentation for a pipe band involves 6 to 25 pipers, 3 to 10 side drummers, 1 to 6 tenor drummers and 1 bass drummer. Occasionally this instrumentation is augmented to include additional instruments (such as additional percussion instruments or keyboard instruments), but this is typically done only in concert settings.
Pipe bands are a long-standing tradition in other areas with Celtic roots, such as the regions of Galicia, Asturies and Cantabria in Northern Spain and Brittany in Western France, as well as other regions with Celtic influence in other parts of Europe. It's also a long-standing tradition in the British Commonwealth of Nations countries and former British colonies such as the United States, Canada, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Brunei, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Pipe bands have also been established in countries with few Scottish or Celtic connections such as Thailand, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina.

[[Scottish smallpipes]]

CATEGORIES: Bagpipes, Scottish musical instruments

The Scottish smallpipe, in its modern form, is a bellows-blown bagpipe re-developed by Colin Ross and others.Hamish Moore There are many surviving bellows blown examples of similar historical instruments as well as the mouth-blown Montgomery smallpipes in E, dated 1757, which are now in the National Museum of Scotland. There is some discussion of the historical Scottish smallpipes in Collinson's history of the bagpipes.Collinson, F., The Bagpipe, The history of a Musical Instrument, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1975, ISBN 0710079133 But more reliable research and information can be obtained in Hugh Cheape's  "Bagpipes: A National Collection." Some instruments are being built as direct copies of historical examples,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goodbagpipes.co.uk |title=www.goodbagpipes.co.uk |publisher=www.goodbagpipes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl] but few modern instruments are directly modelled from older examples; the modern instrument is typically larger and lower pitched. The innovations leading to the modern instrument, in particular the design of the reeds, were largely taken from the Northumbrian smallpipes.
Although there is evidence of small pipes dating back to 15th century, in its current form it is perhaps the youngest bagpipe with any popularity, having only existed in this form since the early 1980s. The playing tradition copies that of the Border Pipes, which use few if any gracenotes.

[[Mayfly]]
CATEGORIES: Mayflies

Mayflies or shadflies are insects belonging to the order Ephemeroptera (from the Greek εφημερος, [tpl]lang|el|ephemeros[/tpl] = "short-lived" (literally "lasting a day" "daily" or "day-long"), πτερον, [tpl]lang|el|pteron[/tpl] = "wing", referring to the brief lifespan of adults). They have been placed into an ancient group of insects termed the Palaeoptera, which also contains dragonflies and damselflies. They are aquatic insects whose immature stage (called "naiad" or, colloquially, "nymph") usually lasts one year in fresh water. The adults are short-lived, from a few minutes to a few days, depending on the species. About 2,500 species are known worldwide, including about 630 species in North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ento.csiro.au/education/insects/ephemeroptera.html|title=CSIRO page for Ephemeroptera[/tpl] - accessed 28 August 2008 The naiads live primarily in streams under rocks, decaying vegetation, or in the sediment. Few species live in lakes, but they are among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar along the shores of Lake Erie.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pserie.psu.edu/seagrant/publications/fs/Mayfly_12-2003.pdf |title=Return of the mayfly: an indicator of an improving habitat |publisher=Pennsylvania Sea Grant |year=2003[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Most species feed on algae or diatoms, but a few species are predatory. The naiad stage may last from several months to several years, with a number of moults along the way. Most mayfly naiads are distinctive in having seven pairs of gills on the dorsum of the abdomen. In addition, most possess three long cerci or tails at the end of their bodies. Some species, notably in the genus Epeorus, have only two tails. In the last aquatic stage, dark wingpads are visible. Developmentally, these insects are considered hemimetabolous. A more casual and familiar term is "incomplete metamorphosis". Mayflies are unique among insects in that they moult one more time after acquiring functional wings (this is also known as the alate stage); this last-but-one winged instar usually lives a very short time, often a matter of hours, and is known as a subimago or to fly fishermen as a dun. Mayflies in this stage are a favourite food of many fish, and many fishing flies are modelled to resemble them.

[[Biniou]]

CATEGORIES: Breton musical instruments, Bagpipes, Breton culture

Binioù means bagpipe in the Breton language.
There are two bagpipes called binioù in Brittany: the traditional binioù kozh or biniou-bihan (kozh means "old" in Breton, bihan means "small") and the binioù bras (bras means "big"), which was brought into Brittany from Scotland in the late 19th century. The oldest native bagpipe in Brittany is the veuze, from which the binioù kozh is thought to be derived.
The binioù bras is essentially the same as the Scottish Great Highland Bagpipe; sets are manufactured by Breton makers or  imported from Scotland or elsewhere.
The binioù kozh has a one octave scale, and is very high-pitched; it is tuned to play one octave higher than the bombard which it accompanies. More traditional forms have a single drone, while modern instruments sometimes have two. In the old days the leather used for the bag was usually from a dog's skin, but this is nowadays replaced by synthetic materials or other leathers which are easier to procure, like cow or sheep.
Traditionally it is played in duet with the bombard, a double reed instrument which sounds an octave below the binioù chanter, for Breton  folk dancing.  The binioù bras is typically used as part of a bagad band, although it is sometimes also paired with a bombard.

[[Border pipes]]
CATEGORIES: Bagpipes, Scottish musical instruments, Northumbrian music

The border pipes are a type of bagpipe related to the Scottish Great Highland Bagpipe. It is perhaps confusable with the Scottish smallpipe, although it is a quite different and much older instrument. Although most modern Border pipes are closely modelled on similar historic instruments, the modern Scottish smallpipes are a modern reinvention, inspired by historic instruments but largely based on Northumbrian smallpipes in their construction.  
The name, which is modern, refers to Scotland's border country, where the instrument was once common, so much so that many towns there used to maintain a piper. The instrument was found much more widely than this, however; it was noted as far north as Aberdeenshire, south of the Border in Northumberland and elsewhere in the north of England.  Indeed, some late 17th-century paintings, such as a tavern scene  by Egbert van Heemskerck, probably from south-eastern England, show musicians playing such instruments. Other names have been used for the instrument: Lowland pipes and reel pipes in Scotland, and  in Northumberland.  However, the term reel pipes historically refers to instruments similar to Highland pipes, but primarily intended for indoor use. 
While the instrument had been widespread in the 18th century, by the late 19th century it was no longer played.  There was an attempt to revive it in Northumberland in the 1920s,   and the term  half-long pipes is now used to refer specifically to surviving examples from this period.

CATEGORIES: Spanish musical instruments, Galician musical instruments, Galician music, Bagpipes, Portuguese musical instruments

The Galician gaita (Gaita galega in galician, and Gaita gallega" in "Spanish") is a traditional bagpipe of Galicia and Portugal. Is very similar to those of Asturias.
The word gaita is used across northern Spain as a generic term for "bagpipe", although in the south of Spain and Portugal it denotes a variety of horn, flute or oboe like instruments according to region. 
Suggestions as to the origin of the name gaita are many. It has been compared to the names of eastern European bagpipes, such as gaida, gajda, and gajdy. The linguist Joan Coromines has suggested that the word gaita most likely derived from a Gothic word gait or gata, meaning "goat"; as the bag of a gaita is made from a whole, case-skinned goat hide. Gothic was spoken in Spain from the sixth century to the eighth century when the country was ruled by the Visigoths. The Visigoths originated in eastern Europe.

A city ([tpl]lang-fil|lungsod; siyudad[/tpl]; Kapampangan: lakanbalen; lakanbalayan)(lungsod, or sometimes siyudad in Filipino or Tagalog) is a local government unit (LGU) in the Philippines. All Philippine cities are chartered cities, whose existence as corporate and administrative entities is governed by their own specific municipal charters in addition to the Local Government Code of 1991, which specifies their administrative structure and powers. As of September 2012, there are 143 cities. [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/|title=Official Website|publisher=National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB)|accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl] 
Cities are entitled to one representative in the House of Representatives per 250,000 people.  They are legally provided their own police force and allowed to use a common seal. As corporate entities, cities have the power to take, purchase, receive, hold, lease, convey, and dispose of real and personal property for its general interests, condemn private property for public use (eminent domain), contract and be contracted with, sue and exercise all the powers conferred to it by Congress. Only an Act of Congress can create or amend a city charter, and with this city charter Congress confers on a city certain powers that regular municipalities or even other cities may not have. 
Despite the differences in the powers accorded to each city, all cities regardless of status are given a bigger share of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) compared to regular municipalities, as well as being generally more autonomous than regular municipalities.
There are twelve metropolitan areas in the Philippines as defined by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). Metro Manila is the largest conurbation or urban agglomeration in the country, and its official metropolitan area is composed of the city of Manila plus 15 neighboring cities and a municipality. Other metropolitan areas are centered around the cities of Baguio, Dagupan, Angeles, Olongapo, Batangas, Naga, Cebu, Iloilo, Bacolod, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga and Davao.

Star Fox, known in Japan as [tpl]nihongo|StarFox|スターフォックス|SutāFokkusu[/tpl], is a video game series developed and published by Nintendo. The original game was a forward-scrolling 3D Sci-Fi rail shooter. Later sequels added more directional freedom as the series progressed. The game concept was inspired by a shrine to a fox god who could fly, which Shigeru Miyamoto visited regularly. The shrine was accessible through a series of arches, thus inspiring the gameplay.Equinox – Serious Fun (AKA 'Video Games') (1993) Channel 4. http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/500185?view=credit
The first game in the series, developed by Nintendo EAD and programmed by Argonaut Software, used the Super FX Chip to create the first accelerated 3D gaming experience on a home console. The Super FX Chip was an additional math co-processor that was built into the Game Pak and helped the Super Famicom and SNES better render the game's graphics. The Super FX Chip has been used in other Super Famicom/SNES games as well, some with increased processing speed. Its remake, Star Fox 64, further revolutionized the video game industry by being the first Nintendo 64 game to feature the Rumble Pak.
Due to trademark issues over the name Star Fox in PAL region territories, Star Fox and Star Fox 64 were released in those countries as Starwing and Lylat Wars respectively. However, Nintendo bought the rights before the release of Star Fox Adventures so future games could be released worldwide with the same name.
The games follow an independent mercenary unit called Star Fox (made up of anthropomorphic animals) and their adventures around the Lylat system.

[[Music of Nigeria]]

CATEGORIES: Nigerian music

The music of Nigeria includes many kinds of Folk and popular music, some of which are known worldwide. Styles of folk music are related to the multitudes of ethnic groups in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments, and songs. Little is known about the country's music history prior to European contact, although bronze carvings dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries have been found depicting musicians and their instruments.Karolyi, pg. 4 The largest ethnic groups are the  Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba. Traditional music from Nigeria and throughout Africa is almost always functional; in other words, it is performed to mark a ritual such as a wedding or funeral and not for pure entertainment or artistic enjoyment.Titon Although some Nigerians, especially children and the elderly, play instruments for their own amusement, solo performance is otherwise rare. Music is closely linked to agriculture, and there are restrictions on, for example, which instruments can be played during different parts of the growing season.
Work songs are a common type of traditional Nigerian music. They help to keep the rhythm of workers in fields, river canoes and other fields. Women use complex rhythms in housekeeping tasks, such as pounding yams to highly ornamented music. In the northern regions, farmers work together on each other's farms and the host is expected to supply musicians for his neighbours.
The issue of musical composition is also highly variable. The Hwana, for example, believe that all songs are taught by the peoples' ancestors, while the Tiv give credit to named composers for almost all songs, and the Efik name individual composers only for secular songs. In many parts of Nigeria, musicians are allowed to say things in their lyrics that would otherwise be perceived as offensive. 
The most common format for music in Nigeria is the call-and-response choir, in which a lead singer and a chorus interchange verses, sometimes accompanied by instruments that either shadow the lead text or repeat and ostinato vocal phrase. The southern area features complex rhythms and solo players using melody instruments, while the north more typically features polyphonic wind ensembles. The extreme north region is associated with monodic (i.e., single-line) music with an emphasis on drums, and tends to be more influenced by Islamic music.
Epic poetry is found in parts of Nigeria, and its performance is always viewed as musical in nature. Blind itinerant performers, sometimes accompanying themselves with a string instrument, are known for reciting long poems of unorthodox Islamic text among the Kanuri and Hausa. These, and other related traditions, may be descended from similar Maghrebian and European traditions. The Ozidi Saga found in the Niger Delta is a well-known epic that takes seven days to perform and utilises a narrator, a chorus, percussion, mime and dance.

The Bugaloos is an American children's television series, produced by brothers Sidney Krofft and Martin Krofft, that aired on NBC on Saturday mornings from 1970 to 1972. The show featured a musical group composed of four British-accented teenagers, who lived in fictional Tranquility Forest. They wore insect-themed outfits with antennae and wings which allowed them to fly, though on occasion, they were shown flying on surfboards.  They were constantly beset by the evil machinations of Benita Bizarre, played by comedienne Martha Raye. Bizarre, being untalented and ugly herself, was covetous of the Bugaloos' musical prowess.CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons’ Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records

[tpl]Essay-like|article|date=February 2010[/tpl]}}
The South African music scene includes both popular (jive) and folk forms. Pop styles are based on four major sources, Zulu isicathamiya singing and harmonic mbaqanga.
Christian missions provided the first organised musical training in the country, bringing to light many of the modern country's earliest musicians, including Enoch Sontonga, who wrote the national anthem Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. By the end of the nineteenth century, South African cities like Cape Town were large enough to attract foreign musicians, especially American ragtime players.  African American spirituals were popularised in the 1890s by Orpheus McAdoo's Jubilee Singers.

The Ottawa Rebel was a team in the National Lacrosse League based in Ottawa, Ontario from 2001 until 2003. They initially played at the Corel Centre (now called the Canadian Tire Centre) in nearby Kanata, but part-way through the 2002 season moved to the smaller, but centrally located, Ottawa Civic Centre.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lacrosse-network.com/outsidersguide/news020215.htm|title=Rebel going downtown after Saturday|work=Outsider's Guide to the NLL|date=2002-02-15|accessdate=2006-11-09[/tpl] From 1997 until 2000 the team was located in Syracuse, New York and was called the Syracuse Smash.
The Rebel was owned by the Brad Watters group which also brought lacrosse to Toronto and Montreal.
In their first season in Ottawa the Rebel had one win and thirteen losses and finished last of nine teams. Their second season was slightly better, with four wins and twelve losses, but due to tie breakers they finished fourth in the Northern Division and thirteenth overall behind the Calgary Roughnecks, who also finished with a 4-12 record. In their third and final year in Ottawa they again had four wins and twelve losses, placing them fourth in the Northern Division again but tenth out of twelve in the overall league standings.
As the Syracuse Smash they were last overall all three years prompting the move to the Canadian capital.
The franchise became inactive after the 2003 season. In 2005, it was purchased by Bruce Urban and moved to Edmonton, Alberta, becoming the Edmonton Rush.

[[Billboard]]

CATEGORIES: Billboards, Street furniture, Advertising

A billboard (sometimes also called a hoarding in the UK and many other parts of the world) is a large outdoor advertising structure (a billing board), typically found in high-traffic areas such as alongside busy roads. Billboards present large advertisements to passing pedestrians and drivers. Typically showing large, ostensibly witty slogans, and distinctive visuals, billboards are highly visible in the top designated market areas.
Bulletins are the largest standard-size billboards. Located primarily on major highways, expressways or principal arterials, they command high-density consumer exposure (mostly to vehicular traffic). Bulletins afford greatest visibility due not only to their size, but because they allow creative "customizing" through extensions and embellishments.
Posters are the other common form of billboard advertising, located mostly along primary and secondary arterial roads. Posters are a smaller format than bulletins and are viewed principally by residents and commuter traffic, with some pedestrian exposure.

[[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]

CATEGORIES: Democratic Republic of the Congo music

Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo varies in its different forms. Outside of Africa, most music from the Democratic Republic of Congo is called soukous, which most accurately refers instead to a dance popular in the late 1960s.  The term rumba or 
rock-rumba is also used generically to refer to Congolese music, though neither is  precise nor accurately descriptive.
People from the Congo have no term for their own music, per se, although muziki na biso (our music) was used until the late 1970s, and now the most common name is "ndule", which simply means music in the Lingala language. Most songs from the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo are sung in Lingala.

[[Music of Mozambique]]
CATEGORIES: Mozambican music

The native folk music of Mozambique has been highly influenced by Portuguese forms.  The most popular style of modern dance music is marrabenta. Mozambican music also influenced another Lusophone music in Brazil, like maxixe (its name derived from Maxixe in Mozambique),  and Cuban music like Mozambique.
Culture was an integral part of the struggle for independence, which began in 1964.  Leaders of the independence movement used cultural solidarity to gain support from the common people, while the Portuguese colonialists promoted their own culture.  By the time independence came in 1975, Mozambican bands had abandoned their previous attempts at European-style music, and began forging new forms based out of local folk styles and the new African popular music coming from Zaire, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia and South Africa.
In 1978, the Ministry of Education and Culture organized a National Dance Festival that involved more than half a million people, and led to the creation of numerous organizations and festivals promoting Mozambican music.

Panay ([tpl]IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|n|aɪ[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-tl|pɐˈnaj|lang[/tpl]) is an island in the Philippines located in the western part of the Visayas. Politically, it is divided into four provinces: Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Iloilo, all in the Western Visayas Region. It is located southeast of the island of Mindoro and northwest of Negros, separated by the Guimaras Strait. Between Negros and Panay Island lie the island-province of Guimaras. To the north is the Sibuyan Sea and the islands of Romblon; to the southwest is the Sulu SeaC.Michael Hogan. 2011. Sulu Sea and the Panay Gulf.
The island has many rivers including Akean, Halaur River, Banica, Iloilo, and Panay.
Panay was the seat of the ancient Confederation of Madja-as—the first pre-Hispanic Philippine state within the Visayas islands region, and the second Srivijayan colony in the Philippine Archipelago, next to the Sulu Archipelago.G. Nye Steiger, H. Otley Beyer, Conrado Benitez, A History of the Orient, Oxford: 1929, Ginn and Company, p. 120. It was established by nine rebel datus or high officials connected with the court of Brunei, who were forced to leave that country on account of enmity of the Rajah at that time ruling the land. The datus, together with their wives and children, as well as few faithful servants and followers were secretly escorted out of the country by the Rajah's Chief Minister, whose name was Datu Puti.G. Nye Steiger, H. Otley Beyer, Conrado Benitez, A History of the Orient, Oxford: 1929, Ginn and Company, p. 120. The local folklore says that the name of the Bornean Rajah was Makatunao.
They embarked on sailing rafts of the type used by the Visayans (the term used in the Malay settlements, of what is now Borneo and Philippines, to refer to Srivijayans) in Sumatra and Borneo.G. Nye Steiger, H. Otley Beyer, Conrado Benitez, A History of the Orient, Oxford: 1929, Ginn and Company, p. 120. According to tradition, which survive in the local culture of Western Visayas, this seafaring vessel is called Balangay, from which Barangay—the smallest social unit in the present-day Philippines—came from.
The semi-democratic confederation reached its peak during the 15th century under the leadership of Datu Padojinog when it warred against the Chinese Empire, the Rajahnate of Butuan, and the sultanates of Sulu and Maguindanao. It was also feared by the people of the Kingdom of Maynila and Tondo.Prehispanic Source Materials Page 74 by William Henry Scott (NEW DAY PUBLISHERS INC.) It was integrated to the Spanish Empire through pacts and treaties (c.1569) by Miguel López de Legazpi and his grandson Juan de Salcedo. During the time of their hispanization, the principalities of the Confederation were already developed settlements with distinct social structure, culture, customs, and religion.In Panay, the existence of highly developed and independent principalities of Ogtong (Oton) and Araut (Dumangas) was well known to early Spanish settlers in the Philippines. The Augustinian historian Gaspar de San Agustin, for example, wrote about the existence of an ancient and illustrious nobility in Araut, in his book Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565–1615). He said: "También fundó convento el Padre Fray Martin de Rada en Araut—que ahora se llama el convento de Dumangas—con la advocación de nuestro Padre San Agustín … Está fundado este pueblo casi a los fines del río de Halaur, que naciendo en unos altos montes en el centro de esta isla (Panay) … Es el pueblo muy hermoso, ameno y muy lleno de palmares de cocos. Antiguamente era el emporio y corte de la más lucida nobleza de toda aquella isla."

Among the archaeological proofs of the existence of this Hiligaynon nation are the artifacts found in pre-Hispanic tombs from many parts of the island, which are now in display at Iloilo Museum. Another testimony of the antiquity of this civilization is the longest and oldest epic in the region, the Hinilawod.

[[Music of Mali]]

CATEGORIES: Malian music, Bamana

The Music of Mali is, like that of most African nations, ethnically diverse, but one influence predominates; that of the ancient Mali Empire of the Mandinka (from c. 1230 to c. 1600). Mande people (Bambara, Maninke, Soninke) make up 50% of the country's population, other ethnic groups include the Fula (17%), Gur-speakers 12%, Songhai people (6%), Tuareg and Moors (10%) and another 5%, including Europeans. Mali is divided into eight regions; Gao, Kayes, Koulikoro, Mopti, Ségou, Sikasso, Tombouctou and Bamako (the eighth region, Kidal, was created in 1991).
Salif Keita, a noble-born Malian who became a singer, brought Mande-based Afro-pop to the world, adopting traditional garb and styles. He says he sings to express himself, however, and not as a traditional jeli or praise-singer. The kora players Sidiki Diabaté and Toumani Diabaté have also achieved some international prominence as have the late Songhai/Fula guitarist Ali Farka Touré and his successors Afel Bocoum and Vieux Farka Touré, the Tuareg band Tinariwen, the duo Amadou et Mariam and Oumou Sangare. Mory Kanté saw major mainstream success with techno-influenced Mande music.
While internationally Malian popular music has been known more for its male artists, domestically, since at least the 1980s, female singers such as Kandia Kouyatés are ubiquitous on radio and television, in markets and on street-corner stalls. Fans follow them for the moralizing nature of their lyrics, the perception that they embody tradition and their role as fashion trend-setters.

Golden rice differs from its parental strain by the addition of three beta-carotene biosynthesis genes. The scientific details of the rice were first published in Science in 2000, the product of an eight-year project by Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg. At the time of publication, golden rice was considered a significant breakthrough in biotechnology, as the researchers had engineered an entire biosynthetic pathway.
In 2005, a new variety called Golden Rice 2, which produces up to 23 times more beta-carotene than the original golden rice, was announced.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Paine |url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n4/full/nbt1082.html |journal=Nature Biotechnology |first1=Jacqueline A |volume=23 |last2=Shipton |issue=4 |first2=Catherine A |pages=482–7 |last3=Chaggar |first3=Sunandha |last4=Howells |first4=Rhian M |last5=Kennedy |first5=Mike J |last6=Vernon |first6=Gareth |last7=Wright |first7=Susan Y |last8=Hinchliffe |first8=Edward |last9=Adams |first9=Jessica L | displayauthors=9 |year=2005 |pmid=15793573 |title=Improving the nutritional value of Golden Rice through increased pro-vitamin A content |doi= 10.1038/nbt1082 [/tpl] Although golden rice was developed as a humanitarian tool, it has met with significant opposition from environmental and anti-globalization activists.

The maxwell, abbreviated as Mx, is the compound derived CGS unit of magnetic flux. The unit was previously called a line. The unit name honours James Clerk Maxwell, who presented the unified theory of electromagnetism, and was established by the IEC in 1930.
In a magnetic field of strength one gauss, one maxwell is the total flux across a surface of one square centimetre perpendicular to the field.

The crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), also known as the long-tailed macaque, is a cercopithecine primate native to Southeast Asia. It is referred to as the cynomolgus monkey in laboratories. It has a long history alongside humans; they have been alternately seen as agricultural pests, sacred animals in some temples, and more recently, the subject of medical experiments. The crab-eating macaque lives in matrilineal social groups with a female dominance hierarchy, and male members leave the group when they reach puberty. They are opportunistic omnivores   and have been documented using tools to obtain food in Thailand and Myanmar. The crab-eating macaque is a known invasive species and a threat to biodiversity in several locations including Hong Kong and western New Guinea. The significant overlap in macaque and human living space has resulted in greater habitat loss, synanthropic living, and inter- and intra-species conflicts over resources.

Roots music is a broad category of music including bluegrass, country music, gospel, old time music, jug bands, Appalachian folk, blues, Cajun and Native American music.  The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck musicologists as something distinctly new. It is considered "roots music" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and jazz.

[[Homesteading]]
CATEGORIES: Simple living

Broadly defined, homesteading is a lifestyle of self-sufficiency. It is characterized by subsistence agriculture, home preservation of foodstuffs, and it may or may not also involve the small scale production of textiles, clothing, and craftwork for household use or sale. Pursued in different ways around the world — and in different historical eras — homesteading is generally differentiated from rural village or commune living by isolation (either socially or physically) of the homestead.  Use of the term in the United States dates back to the Homestead Act (1862) and before. In sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in nations formerly controlled by the British Empire, a homestead is the household compound for a single extended family. In the UK, the term 'smallholder' is the rough equivalent of 'homesteader'.

[[Small hydro]]

CATEGORIES: Hydroelectricity, Power station technology, Renewable energy

Small hydro is the development of hydroelectric power on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant. The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 megawatts (MW) is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro. This may be stretched up to [tpl]nowrap|30 MW[/tpl] in the United States, and [tpl]nowrap|50 MW[/tpl] in Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://canmetenergy-canmetenergie.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/eng/renewables/small_hydropower.html |title=Small hydro in Canada |publisher=Canmetenergy-canmetenergie.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl] In contrast many hydroelectric projects are of enormous size, such as the generating plant at the Hoover Dam of 2,074 MW or the vast multiple projects of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Small hydro can be further subdivided into mini hydro, usually defined as less than 1,000 kW, and micro hydro which is less than 100 kW. Micro hydro is usually the application of hydroelectric power sized for smaller communities, single families or small enterprise.
Small hydro plants may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy.  Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production. One tool that helps evaluate this issue is the Flow Duration Curve or FDC. The FDC is a Pareto curve of a stream's daily flow rate vs. frequency. Reductions of diversion help the river's ecosystem, but reduce the hydro system's Return on Investment (ROI). The hydro system designer and site developer must strike a balance to maintain both the health of the stream and the economics.
Plants with reservoir, i.e. small storage and small pumped-storage hydropower plants, can contribute to distributed energy storage and decentralized peak and balancing electricity. Such plants can be built to integrate at the regional level intermittent renewable energy sources.[tpl]cite web |last=Crettenand |first=N. |year=2012 |title=The facilitation of mini and small hydropower in Switzerland: shaping the institutional framework.

Joseph-Napoléon-Henri Bourassa ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi buʁasa[/tpl]; September 1, 1868 – August 31, 1952) was a French Canadian political leader and publisher. In 1899, Bourassa was outspoken against the British government's request for Canada to send a militia to fight for Britain in the Second Boer War. Laurier's compromise was to send a volunteer force, but the seeds were sown for future conscription protests during the world wars. Bourassa challenged, unsuccessfully, the proposal to build warships to help protect the empire. He led the opposition to mandatory conscription during World War I, arguing that Canada's interests were not at stake. He opposed Catholic bishops who defended military support of Britain and its allies.Rolando Gomes, "Henri Bourassa et l'Imperialisme Britannique (1899-1918)," Bulletin d'Histoire Politique (2008) 16#3 pp 161-182.

[[Demonic possession]]
CATEGORIES: Charismatic and Pentecostal Christianity, Demons, Occult, Religious behaviour and experience

Demonic possession is held by many belief systems to be the spirit possession of an individual by a malevolent preternatural being, commonly known as a demon. Descriptions of demonic possessions often include erased memories or personalities, convulsions, “fits” and fainting as if one were dying.[tpl]cite journal |last=Ferber |first=Sarah |title=Demonic Possession and Exorcism in Early Modern France |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |pages=25, 116 |isbn=0415212642 [/tpl] Other descriptions include access to hidden knowledge (gnosis) and foreign languages (xenoglossia), drastic changes in vocal intonation and facial structure, the sudden appearance of injuries (scratches, bite marks) or lesions, and superhuman strength. Unlike in channeling, the subject has no control over the possessing entity and so it will persist until forced to leave the victim, usually through a form of exorcism.
Many cultures and religions contain some concept of demonic possession, but the details vary considerably. The oldest references to demonic possession are from the Sumerians, who believed that all diseases of the body and mind were caused by "sickness demons" called gidim or gid-dim.Sumerian "gidim" The priests who practiced exorcisms in these nations were called ashipu (sorcerer) as opposed to an asu (physician) who applied bandages and salves.Indiana Univ: MEDICINE IN ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA Many cuneiform tablets contain prayers to certain gods asking for protection from demons, while others ask the gods to expel the demons that have invaded their bodies.
Shamanic cultures also believe in demon possession and shamans perform exorcisms. In these cultures, diseases are often attributed to the presence of a vengeful spirit (or loosely termed demon) in the body of the patient. These spirits are more often the spectres of animals or people wronged by the bearer, the exorcism rites usually consisting of respectful offerings or sacrificial offerings.
Christianity holds that possession derives from the Devil, i.e. Satan, or one of his lesser demons. In many Christian belief systems, Satan and his demons are actually fallen angels."An Exorcist Tells his Story" by Fr. Gabriele Amorth translated by Nicoletta V.

[[War Crimes Law (Belgium)]]

Belgium's War Crimes Law invokes the concept of universal jurisdiction to allow anyone to bring war crime charges in Belgian courts, regardless of where the alleged crimes have taken place.  
Note that this is a Belgian law and is different from the International Criminal Court, which is a treaty body to try war crimes, and also different from the International Court of Justice, which is a U.N. body to settle disputes between countries.  Both of these bodies reside in nearby The Hague, Netherlands, although some have said that American Servicemen's Protection Act passed by the US was also directed against the War Crimes Law.

In June 2003, the Maine, USA Legislature passed a comprehensive health insurance plan, granting low-cost coverage available to all state residents by 2009. Through a semi-private agency, the state will provide coverage to uninsured residents, small businesses and municipalities and the self-employed.
Premiums are to be set on a sliding scale. For example, individuals making below $27,000 and families making below $55,000 will be eligible for reduced rates.
A watchdog group will be created to monitor hospital and doctor costs.
The bill passed the Maine House of Representatives 105 to 38, and the Maine Senate 25 to 8.
About 15,000 of the 140,000 uninsured have been covered by the program.  The original project goals were to pay for the program with savings from reducing inefficiencies in the existing system and not raise taxes, while providing insurance to 140,000 people.  This year the State raised taxes over 5% to help pay for this program and enrolment in the program is closed due to cost issues.

The Nordic countries are generally taken to include Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Estonia.  The Nordic Council, an international organization, also includes the autonomous territories of Åland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.  Historically, the term Nordic was also applied to  Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The many regions of the Nordic countries share certain traditions, many of which have diverged significantly.  It is possible to group together the Baltic states (or, sometimes, only Estonia) and parts of northwest Russia as sharing cultural similarities, contrasted with Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Atlantic islands of Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Greenland's Inuit culture has its own musical traditions, influenced by Scandinavian culture.  Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the Baltic nations and the Scandinavian nations.

[tpl]for|other flights numbered 191|Flight 191 (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Flight 191[/tpl]

American Airlines Flight 191 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Los Angeles International Airport. The McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 crashed on May 25, 1979, moments after takeoff from Chicago. All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed, along with two people on the ground. It is the deadliest aviation accident to occur on U.S. soil.
Investigators found that as the jet was beginning its takeoff rotation, engine number one on the left (port) wing separated and flipped over the top of the wing. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic fluid lines and damaged the left wing, resulting in a retraction of the slats. As the jet attempted to climb, the left wing stalled while the right wing, with its slats still deployed, continued to produce lift. The jetliner subsequently rolled to the left and reached a bank angle of 112 degrees (partially inverted), before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon rigging structure holding the engine to the wing caused by faulty maintenance procedures at American Airlines.
While maintenance issues and not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft in the eyes of the public caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long passenger career. It has since found a second career as a cargo airplane.

The Gramophone Company, based in the United Kingdom, was one of the early recording companies, and was the parent organization for the famous "His Master's Voice" (HMV) label. Although the company was merged with another in 1931 to form Electric and Musical Industries Limited (EMI), the company title as "The Gramophone Company Limited" continued in use in the UK into the 1970s, for instance on sleeves and labels of records (such as The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd, vinyl copies of which bear the copyright notice "©1973 The Gramophone Company, Ltd.").

[[Vermeer Quartet]]
CATEGORIES: Musical groups established in 1969, American string quartets

The Vermeer Quartet was a string quartet founded in 1969 at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont and active until 2007.
With performances in practically every major city in North and South America, Europe, the Far East, and Australia, the Vermeer Quartet achieved an international stature as one of the world's finest ensembles. The Vermeer performed at virtually all the most prestigious festivals, including Tanglewood, Aldeburgh, Aspen, Mostly Mozart, Taos, Bath, South Bank, Lucerne, Stresa, Flanders, Kneisel Hall, Caramoor, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Berlin, Schleswig-Holstein, Orlando, Florida, Daniel, Edinburgh, Great Woods, Spoleto, Ravinia, and the Casals Festival.  Based in Chicago, they spent part of each summer on the coast of Maine as the featured ensemble for Bay Chamber Concerts.  
The Vermeer Quartet performed well over two hundred works, including nearly all the "standard" string quartets, many lesser-known compositions, a number of contemporary scores, and various other works with guests.  Their discography includes the complete string quartets of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and Bartók, plus various other works by Haydn, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Dvořák, Verdi, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, and Schnittke.  
In 2003 they received their 2nd Grammy nomination for their CD of the Shostakovich and Schnittke piano quintets with Boris Berman on the Naxos label. Their recording of the six Bartók quartets was released by Naxos in May 2005, and received a 3rd Grammy nomination.
The Vermeer was associated with Northern Illinois University as "resident artist faculty" since 1970, where they trained some of the most gifted young ensembles performing today, including the Shanghai String Quartet, Enso String Quartet, Avalon String Quartet, Pacifica String Quartet, and Arianna String Quartet. They were also Fellows at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, England.

[[Thalassocracy]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of government, Empires, Former empires, Athenian Empire, Age of Sail

The term thalassocracy (from Greek language [tpl]lang|grc|θάλασσα[/tpl] (thalassa), meaning "sea", and [tpl]lang|grc|κρατεῖν[/tpl] (kratein), meaning "to rule", giving [tpl]lang|grc|θαλασσοκρατία[/tpl] (thalassokratia), "rule of the sea") refers to a state with primarily maritime realms—an empire at sea, such as the Phoenician network of merchant cities. Traditional thalassocracies seldom dominate interiors, even in their home territories (for example: Phoenician Tyre, Sidon and Carthage or Srivijaya and Majapahit in Southeast Asia). It is necessary to distinguish this traditional sense of thalassocracy from an "empire", where the state's territories, though possibly linked principally or solely by the sea lanes, generally extend into mainland interiors.
The term can also simply refer to naval supremacy, in either military or commercial senses of the word "supremacy". Indeed, the word thalassocracy itself was first used by the Greeks to describe the government of the Minoan civilization, whose power depended on its navy. Herodotus also spoke of the need to counter the Phoenician thalassocracy by developing a Greek "empire of the sea".

[[Roodmas]]

CATEGORIES: Christian festivals and holy days, May observances

Roodmas (from Old English 'rood' rod, cross, and 'mas', mass),Roodmas held on May 3, was the celebration of the Feast of the Cross observed in some Christian churches and rites, particularly the historical Gallican Rite of the Catholic Church. It commemorates the finding by Saint Helena of the True Cross in Jerusalem in 355. The feast originally commemorated the dedication of the Basilica of the Resurrection and was linked with the finding of the cross shortly after.
Helena was reported to have found the True Cross on May 3, 355. However, most Catholic and Eastern Orthodox rites celebrate the Feast of the Cross on September 14, commemorating the day in 628 that the piece of the cross taken by the Persian Empire was recovered by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius. After the Gallican and Latin Rites were combined, the days were observed individually as the Finding of the Holy Cross (May 3) and the Triumph of the Cross (September 14). Some Protestant churches followed this practice; the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer places Roodmas on May 3. However, the celebrations were combined into one feast by Pope John XXIII in 1960, and since then the Catholic Church uses only the September 14 date. The Church of England followed suit with the adoption of the Common Worship liturgy in 2000.

Prisoner is an Australian soap opera that is set in the Wentworth Detention Centre, a fictional women's prison. In the United States and United Kingdom it was billed as Prisoner: Cell Block H, and in Canada as Caged Women. The series was produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation in Australia, and aired on Network Ten, running 692 episodes from 27 February 1979 to 11 December 1986, after originally only devised as a 16 part mini-series.
The series was inspired by British television drama Within These Walls, which had achieved moderate success in Australia. Prisoner producers even approached Googie Withers of Within These Walls to play the role of Prisoner[tpl]'[/tpl]s governor, an offer that she declined. Because of an injunction brought by UK-based ATV, which considered the title too similar to their own series, The Prisoner, it was originally not possible for overseas broadcasters to screen the show under the  Prisoner title, which necessitated a name change.
In March 2012, it was announced that the series would be "reimagined" on Foxtel in a new version entitled Wentworth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.memorabletv.com/news/wentworth-prisoner-re-born-on-foxtel|title=Wentworth: Prisoner re-born on Foxtel|publisher=Memorable TV|accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://if.com.au/2012/03/05/article/Foxtel-commissions-new-Prisoner-series-titled-Wentworth/BYJXEEGDWR.html|title=Foxtel commissions new Prisoner series, titled /Wentworth|work=if.com.au|accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Josie|url=http://josiesjuice.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/prisoner-is-back-as-wentworth.html|title=Josie's Juice: 'Prisoner' is back: as 'Wentworth'|work=josiesjuice.blogspot.co.uk|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl]

The Symposium ([tpl]lang-grc|Συμπόσιον[/tpl]) is a philosophical text by Plato dated c. 385–380 BC.Cobb, p. 11. It concerns itself at one level with the genesis, purpose and nature of love, and (in latter-day interpretations) is the origin of the concept of Platonic love.
Love is examined in a sequence of speeches by men attending a symposium, or drinking party. Each man must deliver an encomium, a speech in praise of Love (Eros). The party takes place at the house of the tragedian Agathon in Athens. Socrates in his speech asserts that the highest purpose of love is to become a philosopher or, literally, a lover of wisdom. The dialogue has been used as a source by social historians seeking to throw light on life in ancient Athens, in particular upon sexual behavior, and the symposium as an institution.

The M2 Machine Gun or Browning .50 Caliber Machine Gun is a heavy machine gun designed towards the end of World War I by John Browning. It is very similar in design to Browning's earlier M1919 Browning machine gun, which was chambered for the .30-06 cartridge. The M2 uses the much larger and much more powerful .50 BMG cartridge, which was developed alongside and takes its name from the gun itself (BMG standing for Browning Machine Gun). The M2 has been referred to as "Ma Deuce",[tpl]cite book |last = Rottman |first = Gordon |title = The Us Army in the Vietnam War 1965–73 |publisher = Osprey Publishing |location = Reading |year = 2008 |isbn = 1-84603-239-3 |page=56[/tpl] as a GI phonetic slang or "the fifty" in reference to its caliber. The design has had many specific designations; the official designation for the current infantry type is Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Flexible. It is effective against infantry, unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and boats, light fortifications and low-flying aircraft. The M2 machine gun has been in production longer than any other machine gun.
The Browning .50 caliber machine gun has been used extensively as a vehicle weapon and for aircraft armament by the United States from the 1930s to the present. It was heavily used during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Falklands War, and during the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan in the 2000s and 2010s. It is the primary heavy machine gun of NATO countries, and has been used by many other countries. The M2 has been in use longer than any other small arm in U.S. inventory except the .45 ACP M1911 pistol, also designed by John Browning.
The current M2HB is manufactured in the United States by General Dynamics[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4360 |title=Contracts for Friday, September 03, 2010 |publisher=Defense.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19[/tpl] and U.S. Ordnance[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4072 |title=Contracts for Wednesday, July 15, 2009 |publisher=Defense.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19[/tpl] for use by the United States government, and for U.S. Foreign Allies via FMS sales.

The .50 Browning Machine Gun (.50 BMG) or 12.7×99mm NATO is a cartridge developed for the Browning .50 caliber machine gun in the late 1910s. Entering service officially in 1921, the round is based on a greatly scaled-up .30-06 cartridge.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] Under STANAG 4383, it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries.NATO Infantry Weapons Standardization,  Per G. Arvidsson, ChairmanWeapons & Sensors Working GroupLand Capability Group 1 - Dismounted Soldier NATO Army Armaments Group The cartridge itself has been made in many variants: multiple generations of regular ball, tracer, armor piercing, incendiary, and saboted sub-caliber rounds. The rounds intended for machine guns are linked using metallic links.
The .50 BMG cartridge is also used in long-range target and sniper rifles, as well as other .50-caliber machine guns. The use in single-shot and semi-automatic rifles has resulted in many specialized match-grade rounds not used in .50-caliber machine guns. A McMillan Tac-50 .50 BMG sniper rifle was used by Canadian Army Corporal Rob Furlong of the PPCLI to achieve what was then the longest-range confirmed sniper kill in history, when he shot a Taliban combatant at 2,430 meters (2,657 yards) during the 2002 campaign in the Afghanistan War.[tpl]cite web|author=Michael Friscolanti |url=http://www.macleans.ca/canada/national/article.jsp?content=20060515_126689_126689 |title=Friscolanti, Michael (May 15, 2006).

This weapon was used by other snipers, and eventually purpose-built sniper rifles were developed specifically for this round. 
DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has contracted with Lockheed Martin to develop the EXACTO program, including .50-caliber bullets complete with microprocessors and steering vanes that allow the bullet to adjust its trajectory mid-flight to stay on target when the flight path has been altered by uncontrollable variables, as well as weapons that fire these rounds and monitor their flight. The weapon system is expected to be available in 2015.
A wide variety of ammunition is available, and the availability of match grade ammunition has increased the usefulness of .50 caliber rifles by allowing more accurate fire than lower quality rounds.

[[K-theory]]

CATEGORIES: K-theory

In mathematics, K-theory is, roughly speaking, the study of certain kinds of invariants of large matrices.[tpl]Citation|last = Atiyah |first = Michael |authorlink = Michael Atiyah |year = 2000 |title = K-Theory Past and Present |arxiv = math/0012213 |version = v1 |postscript =  [/tpl] It originated as the study of a ring generated by vector bundles over a topological space or scheme. In algebraic topology, it is an extraordinary cohomology theory known as topological K-theory. In algebra and algebraic geometry, it is referred to as algebraic K-theory. It is also a fundamental tool in the field of operator algebras. 
K-theory involves the construction of families of K-functors that map from topological spaces or schemes to associated rings; these rings reflect some aspects of the structure of the original spaces or schemes. As with functors to groups in algebraic topology, the reason for this functorial mapping is that it is easier to compute some topological properties from the mapped rings than from the original spaces or schemes. Examples of results gleaned from the K-theory approach include Bott periodicity, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and the Adams operations.
In high energy physics, K-theory and in particular twisted K-theory have appeared in Type II string theory where it has been conjectured that they classify D-branes, Ramond–Ramond field strengths and also certain spinors on generalized complex manifolds. In condensed matter physics K-theory has been used to classify topological insulators, superconductors and stable Fermi surfaces. For more details, see K-theory (physics).

Henry Ossian Flipper (21 March 1856 – 3 May 1940) was an American soldier, former slave, and the first African American to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1877, earning a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army.
Following Flipper's commission, he was transferred to one of the all-black regiments serving in the US Army which were historically led by white officers.  Assigned to A Troop under the command of Captain Nicholas M. Nolan, he became the first non-white officer to lead Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry. Flipper served with competency and distinction during the Apache Wars and the Victorio Campaign but was haunted by rumors alleging improprieties.  At one point he was court martialed and dismissed from the US Army.
After losing his commission in the Army, Flipper worked throughout Mexico and Latin America and as an assistant to the Secretary of the Interior. He retired to Atlanta in 1931 and died of natural causes in 1940.
In 1994 his descendants applied to the US military for a review of Flipper's court martial and dismissal.  A review found that the conviction and punishment were "unduly harsh and unjust" and recommended that Flipper’s dismissal be changed to a good conduct discharge.  Shortly afterwards, an application for pardon was filed with the Secretary of the Army which was forwarded to the Department of Justice.  President Bill Clinton pardoned Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper on 19 February 1999.

[[Linux Standard Base]]

CATEGORIES: Linux, ISO standards, Linux Foundation, Interfaces of the Linux kernel, Linux APIs

The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is a joint project by several Linux distributions under the organizational structure of the Linux Foundation to standardize the software system structure, including the filesystem hierarchy used in the GNU/Linux  operating system. The LSB is based on the POSIX specification, the Single UNIX Specification, and several other open standards, but extends them in certain areas.
According to the LSB:
The LSB compliance may be certified for a product by a certification procedure.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Certification | title = Certifying an Application to the LSB | publisher = Linux Foundation | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2010-04-26[/tpl]
The LSB specifies for example: standard libraries, a number of commands and utilities that extend the POSIX standard, the layout of the file system hierarchy, run levels, the printing system, including spoolers such as CUPS and tools like Foomatic and several extensions to the X Window System.
The command lsb_release -a is available in many systems to get the LSB version details, or can be made available by installing lsb-release.

Baker v.

The defendants unsuccessfully argued that redistricting of legislative districts is a "political question", and hence not a question that may be resolved by federal courts.
Reynolds v. Sims (1964) was another major case of the Warren Court era involving state legislative districts.

Josiah Henson (June 15, 1789 – May 5, 1883) was an author, abolitionist, and minister. Born into slavery in Charles County, Maryland, he escaped to Ontario, Canada, in 1830, and founded a settlement and laborer's school for other fugitive slaves at Dawn, near Dresden in Kent County. At the time of his arrival, Ontario was known as the Province of Upper Canada (U.C.), becoming the Province of Canada in 1841, then Ontario in 1867, all within Henson's lifetime there. Henson's autobiography, The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself (1849), is widely believed to have inspired the character of the fugitive slave, George Harris, in Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), who returned to Kentucky for his wife and escaped across the Ohio River, eventually to Canada.See National Underground Railroad to History's "Resistance to Slavery in Maryland," p. 129f.; http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/discover_history/upload/ResistanceMDRpt.pdf Following the success of Stowe's novel, Henson issued an expanded version of his memoir in 1858, Truth Stranger Than Fiction. Father Henson's Story of His Own Life (published Boston: John P. Jewett & Company, 1858). Interest in his life continued, and nearly two decades later, his life story was updated and published as Uncle Tom's Story of His Life: An Autobiography of the Rev. Josiah Henson (1876).

CATEGORIES: Power (physics), Audio electronics

Audio power is the electrical power transferred from an audio amplifier to a loudspeaker, measured in watts.  The electrical power delivered to the loudspeaker, together with its sensitivity, determines the sound power level generated (with the rest being converted to heat).
Amplifiers are limited in the electrical energy they can amplify, while loudspeakers are limited in the electrical energy they can convert to sound energy without distorting the audio signal or damaging themselves.  These power ratings are important to consumers finding compatible products and comparing competitors.

As of 2010, four confirmed exoplanets are known to orbit the primary star. All four are likely to be jovian planets that are comparable in size to Jupiter. Upsilon Andromedae was both the first multiple-planet system to be discovered around a main-sequence star, and the first multiple-planet system known in a multiple star system.

[[Ruminant]]

CATEGORIES: Herbivorous animals, Even-toed ungulates

Ruminants are mammals that are able to acquire nutrients from plant-based food by fermenting it in a specialized stomach prior to digestion, principally through bacterial actions. The process typically requires regurgitation of fermented ingesta (known as cud), and chewing it again. The process of rechewing the cud to further break down plant matter and stimulate digestion is called "Rumination".[tpl]cite web|title=Rumination: The process of foregut fermentation|url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/cetartiodactyla/Rumination.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Ruminant Digestive System|url=http://faculty.fortlewis.edu/LASHELL_B/Nutr2-Rumdigestion.pdf[/tpl] The word "ruminant" comes from the Latin ruminare, which means "to chew over again". 
There are about 150 species of ruminants, which include both domestic and wild species. Ruminating mammals include cattle, goats, sheep, giraffes, yaks, deer, camels, llamas, antelope, and some macropods.
Taxonomically, the suborder Ruminantia (also known as Ruminants) is a lineage of herbivorous artiodactylas that includes the most advanced and widespread of the world's ungulates.[tpl]cite web|title=Suborder Ruminatia, the Ultimate Ungulate|url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/cetartiodactyla/Ruminantia.html[/tpl] The term 'ruminant' is not synonymous with Ruminantia. Suborder Ruminantia includes many ruminant species, but does not include tylopods and marsupials, which are technically ruminants.

A blue-collar worker is a working class person who performs manual labor in US usage.  Blue-collar work may involve skilled or unskilled manufacturing, mining, sanitation, custodian work, oil field, construction, mechanical, maintenance, technical installation and many other types of physical work. Often something is physically being built or maintained.
In contrast, the white-collar worker typically performs work in an office environment and may involve sitting at a computer or desk. A third type of work is a service worker (pink collar) whose labor is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales or other service oriented work. Many occupations blend blue, white and/or pink (service) industry categorizations.
Blue-collar work is often paid hourly wage-labor, although some professionals may be paid by the project or salaried.  There is a wide range of payscales for such work depending upon field of specialty and experience.

Deftones is the fourth studio album by the American alternative metal band Deftones. It was released on May 20, 2003 through Maverick Records. Although achieving a greater critical reception, Deftones was a commercial disappointment compared with the band's previous effort, White Pony.
The album features a broader spectrum of musical styles than previous Deftones records, ranging from some of their heaviest compositions to rather moody trip hop influences. It would be the band's final album produced by Terry Date, whose collaboration with Deftones dates back to their 1995 debut.

Saint Sebastian (died c. 288) was an early Christian saint and martyr. It is said that he was killed during the Roman emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians. He is commonly depicted in art and literature tied to a post or tree and shot with arrows. This is the most common artistic depiction of Sebastian; however, according to legend, he was rescued and healed by Irene of Rome. Shortly afterwards he criticized Diocletian in person and as a result was clubbed to death.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/arrows-of-desire-how-did-st-sebastian-become-an-enduring-homoerotic-icon-779388.html|publisher=The Independent|title=Arrows of desire: How did St Sebastian become an enduring, homo-erotic icon?|date=10 February 2008[/tpl] He is venerated in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.
The details of Saint Sebastian's martyrdom were first spoken of by 4th-century bishop Ambrose of Milan (Saint Ambrose), in his sermon (number 22) on Psalm 118. Ambrose stated that Sebastian came from Milan and that he was already venerated there at that time. Saint Sebastian is a popular male saint, especially among soldiers.http://dcfaithinaction.org/uncategorized/2012/01/22/the-patron-saint-of-sports/http://www.accsport.asn.au/acc-information/spirit-service-awards/st-sebastian-fellowship-award/about-st-sebastian

Cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of South America and claimed it for Portugal. While details of Cabral's early life are unclear, it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education. He was appointed to head an expedition to India in 1500, following Vasco da Gama's newly opened route around Africa. The object of the undertaking was to return with valuable spices and to establish trade relations in India—bypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of Arab, Turkish and Italian merchants. Although the previous expedition of Vasco da Gama to India, on its sea route, recorded signs of land west of the southern Atlantic Ocean (in 1497), Cabral is regarded as the first captain who ever touched four continents, leading the first expedition that united Europe, Africa, America, and Asia.http://books.google.pt/books?id=hBTqPX4G9Y4C&pg=PA187&dq=Cabral+four+continents&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ei=zPIIU8HvE-af7AakkYDICw&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Cabral%20four%20continents&f=false Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415-1580, Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D.

His fleet of 13 ships sailed far into the western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made landfall on what he initially assumed to be a large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later came to be known as Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.
A storm in the southern Atlantic caused the loss of several ships, and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the Mozambique Channel before proceeding to Calicut in India. Cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights, but Arab merchants saw Portugal's venture as a threat to their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both Muslims and Hindus on the Portuguese entrepôt. The Portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed. Cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the Arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack. From Calicut the expedition sailed to the Kingdom of Cochin, another Indian city-state, where Cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to Europe. Despite the loss of human lives and ships, Cabral's voyage was deemed a success upon his return to Portugal. The extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the Portuguese Crown's finances and helped lay the foundation of a Portuguese Empire that would stretch from the Americas to the Far East.[tpl]efn-ua|The earliest origins of the Portuguese Empire can be traced back to the accession of King João I in 1385 and his subsequent wars of conquest in North Africa, as well as Prince Henry the Navigator's exploratory voyages. The foundation of the Portuguese Empire, however, were firmly laid with the more substantial claim to the territory that would later become Brazil and the establishment of a trading concession in India. See [tpl]harvnb|Diffie|Winius|1977|pp=39, 46, 93, 113, 191[/tpl].[/tpl]
Cabral was later passed over, possibly as a result of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.

According to Christian tradition, Saint Denis (also called Dionysius, Dennis, or Denys) is a Christian martyr and saint. In the third century, he was Bishop of Paris. He was martyred in connection with the Decian persecution of Christians, shortly after 250 AD. Denis is said to have picked his head up after being decapitated, walked ten kilometres (six miles), and preached a sermon the entire way, making him one of many cephalophores in hagiology. He is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church as patron of Paris, France, and as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. The medieval and modern French name "Denis" derives from the ancient name Dionysius.

[[Swept wing]]
CATEGORIES: Wing configurations, Aircraft wing design

A swept wing is a wing planform favored for high subsonic and supersonic speeds, and is found on almost all jet aircraft in one form or another, as well as some high speed propeller aircraft. Compared with straight wings common to slower aircraft, they have a "swept" wing root to wingtip direction angled beyond (usually aftward) the spanwise axis. This has the effect of delaying the drag rise caused by fluid compressibility near the speed of sound, increasing performance.
The concept was first investigated in Germany as early as 1935, but it found no application until just before the end of the Second World War. Swept wings became common on second-generation post-war fighters like the MiG-15 and F-86 Sabre, which demonstrated a decisive superiority over the slower first generation of straight-wing jet fighters during the Korean War. Since then swept wings have become almost universal on all but the slowest jets (such as the A-10).
The term "swept wing" is normally used to mean "swept back", but other swept variants include forward sweep, variable sweep wings and pivoting wings. The delta wing also incorporates the same advantages as part of its layout.
The characteristic "sweep angle" is normally measured by drawing a line from root to tip, 25% of the way back from the leading edge, and comparing that to the perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. Typical sweep angles vary from 0 for a straight-wing aircraft, to 45 degrees or more for fighters and other high-speed designs.

Ruhr University Bochum (German: Ruhr-Universität Bochum, RUB), located on the southern hills of central Ruhr area Bochum, was founded in 1962 as the first new public university in Germany since World War II.  Instruction began in 1965.
The Ruhr-University Bochum is one of the largest universities in Germany and part of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the most important German research funding organization.Ruhr-Universität Bochum: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
The RUB has been very successful in the Excellence Initiative by the German Federal and State Governments (2007), a competition among Germany's most prestigious universities. It was one of the few institutions left competing for the title of an "elite university", but did not succeed in the last round of the competition. There are currently nine universities in Germany that hold this title. 
The University of Bochum was one of the first universities in Germany to introduce international Bachelor and Master degrees, which replaced the traditional German Diplom and Magister. Except for a few special cases (for example in Law) this process has been completed and all degrees been converted. Today, the university offers a total of 150 different study programs from all fields. 
Ruhr University is financed and administered by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Currently, 38,675 students are enrolled, and the university employs over 5,500 staff (408 of which are professors), making it one of the ten largest universities in Germany (as of 2003).  Kurt Biedenkopf, who later became prime minister of the state of Saxony, was director of the university from 1967 to 1969.
Unlike a number of traditional universities, the buildings of Ruhr University are all centralized on one campus, except for the Faculty of Medicine, which also includes some hospitals in Bochum and the Ruhr area. Although the centralized university campus utilizes 1960s architecture almost exclusively, mainly consisting of 14 almost identical high-rise buildings, it is located at the edge of a green belt on  high ground adjacent to the Ruhr valley.

The Y chromosome is one of two sex chromosomes (allosomes) in mammals, including humans, and many other animals. The other is the X chromosome. Y is the sex-determining chromosome in many species, since it is the presence or absence of Y that determines male or female sex. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains the gene SRY, which triggers testis development. The DNA in the human Y chromosome is composed of about 59 million base pairs.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/mapview?chr=Y |title = Ensembl Human MapView release 43 |date = February 2014 |accessdate = 2007-04-14[/tpl] The Y chromosome is passed only from father to son, so analysis of Y chromosome DNA may thus be used in genealogical research.

[[Festa de l'Unità]]
CATEGORIES: Politics of Italy, Communist press festivals

Festa de ''l'Unità is an annual social-democratic celebration in Italy, originally organised by the Italian Communist Party to finance and spread its official newspaper l'Unità ("Unity"), and now organised by   Partito Democratico. It is often misspelled Festa dell'unità'' ("Unity party"), since people forget where the name comes from.
The "festa" is generally organized as lots of separated happenings, usually one for each city, but where the Communist party was more present, every local branch organized its own happening and often all of them collaborated to the organization of a large one as well. Typical aspects are low-price or free typical foods, live music, prize games and street markets. Small events start already in July, but the main happenings take place in September.
While the political aspect was preponderant in its first times, and is at times still important, it has developed with time into a social event for the youth (music events and discos) and elderly people (talking about the political adventures of their past and dancing swing). 
In some parts of Italy, especially in Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany, each and every small village seems to have its own "festa de l'Unità", which is often the biggest social event of the year. In Bologna and in Florence, they have developed into a two-week long, tens-of-thousands-people-packed event that has little resemblance to the original political gathering, and are instead two of the biggest attractors for young people in the nearby areas.
Following the birth in 2007 of the Partito Democratico the name of the Festa dell'Unità was changed, at a national level, to the Festa Democratica.See Partito Democratico website  At the provincial level, however, and for important local party organisations, the traditional name  "Festa de l'Unità" was retained,See, for instance Bologna "Festa de l'Unità" website while elsewhere new hybrid appellations have been adopted such "Festa del Partito Democratico" or "Festa di name".See Contribution of the distinguished journalist and essayist Antonio Padellaro.

Impeccability is the absence of sin.  Christianity teaches this to be an attribute of God (logically God cannot sin, it would mean that he would act against his own will and nature) and therefore it is also commonly, but not uncontroversially, attributed to Christ.

[[Skysurfing]]

CATEGORIES: Boardsports, Acrobatic sports, Parachuting

Sky surfing is a type of skydiving in which the skydiver wears a board attached to his or her feet and performs surfing-style aerobatics during freefall.
The boards used are generally smaller than actual surfboards, and look more like snowboards or large skateboards. The attachment to the feet is normally made removable, so that if the skydiver loses control or has difficulty opening their parachute, the board can be jettisoned. Surf Flite was the first sky board company, copyrighted by Jerry Loftis (January 1, 1969 – August 12, 1998).
Skysurfing is a skill requiring considerable practice. The simplest skysurfing technique is to stand upright on the board during freefall, and tilt the nose of the board down to generate forward movement. However even this basic technique is a balancing act which experienced skydivers find tricky to learn. The extra drag of the board tends to upset the balance and make the skydiver flip over. The jumper must also learn to control the board and their body position so as to open the parachute in a stable configuration. More advanced aerobatics such as loops, rolls and helicopter spins, are more difficult still and are tackled once the basics have been mastered.
Because of the possibility of dropping the board, not every skydiving club permits skysurfing, and only a minority of skydivers have attempted this recent specialisation in the sport.
When a skysurfer is filmed by another skydiver falling alongside them, the resulting film gives the appearance that the skysurfer is riding on the air in the same way a surfer rides on a wave. The downward motion is not very apparent and this creates the illusion that a skysurfer is gliding on air currents like a sailplane or hang glider. In fact a skysurfer always falls at a high speed comparable to any other freefalling parachutist.  The competitive discipline of skysurfing is a team sport consisting of a skysurfer and a camera flyer with a video camera.
The Sky Surf was invented by two French skydivers, Dominique Jacquet and Jean-Pascal Oron in 1986 but it became popular and gained recognition during the 1990s thanks to the efforts of the first few exponents to master the more complex aerobatics, such as the late Patrick de Gayardon and the late Jerry Loftis. The rise of skysurfing coincided with other new-age disciplines in skydiving, such as freestyle and freeflying. Freestyle skydiving is a balletic, mostly individual style which seeks to extend the sport beyond the traditional belly-to-earth flat position used by most skydivers who make formations with their bodies.
Freeflying is also a form of skydiving using a variety of body positions, such as head-down or feet-to-earth, while still building formations with others. These evolutions in skydiving have taken the sport further away from the traditional image of a daredevil stunt.
Skysurfing reached its peak in popularity in the late 1990s.  Skysurfers were featured in prime time television commercials for major brands like Pepsi and AT&T. Competitive team skysurfing was featured as part of the ESPN X Games from 1995 to 2000.  In 1996 and 1997, the SSI Pro Tour staged eight X-Trials qualifying events in both North America and Europe.  During this six-year period, pro skysurf teams received a total of $392,000 in cash winnings and the discipline garnered over 100 hours of global TV exposure without incident.  After ESPN decided not to renew the sport for the seventh season, skysurfing has become relatively rare in the skydiving community.  Reasons for the decline include the rise in popularity of freeflying and wingsuit flying, the hazards associated with flying and releasing the board, and the dwindling number of experienced skysurfers to train new pilots.

Wild at Heart is a 1990 American crime thriller film written and directed by David Lynch, and based on Barry Gifford's 1989 novel of the same name. Both the book and the film revolve around Sailor Ripley and Lula Pace Fortune, a young couple from Cape Fear, North Carolina who go on the run from her domineering mother. Due to her mother's machinations, the mob becomes involved.
Lynch was originally going to produce, but after reading Gifford's book decided to also write and direct the film. He did not like the ending of the novel and decided to change it in order to stay true to his vision of the main characters. Wild at Heart is a road movie and includes several allusions to The Wizard of Oz as well as Elvis Presley and his movies.[tpl]cite news | last=Pearson | first=Matt | title=Wild at Heart | publisher=The British Film Resource | year=1997 | url=http://www.britishfilm.org.uk/lynch/wild_at_heart.html | accessdate=2008-01-26[/tpl]
Early test screenings for the film did not go well; Lynch estimated that 80 people walked out of the first test screening and 100 in the next. The film received mixed to negative critical reviews and was a moderate success at the US box office, grossing USD$14 million, above its $10 million budget. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival,[tpl]cite web | title=Festival de Cannes: Wild at Heart | url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/164/year/1990.html | accessdate=2009-08-07 | work=festival-cannes.com[/tpl] at which it received both negative and positive attention from its audience.

[[Civil service examination]]
CATEGORIES: Civil services, Examinations

Civil service examinations are examinations implemented in various countries for admission to the civil service. They are intended as a method to achieve an effective, rational public administration on a merit system.
The most ancient example of such exams were the imperial examinations of ancient China. Russia implemented such procedures in the turn of the 19th century. 
In the United Kingdom, the permanent and politically neutral Her Majesty's Civil Service, in which appointments were made on merit, was introduced on the recommendations of the 1854 Northcote-Trevelyan Report, which also recommended a clear division between staff responsible for routine ("mechanical") work, and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation in an "administrative" class. The report was well-timed, since bureaucratic chaos in the Crimean War (1854–56) promptly caused a clamour for the change. A Civil Service Commission was accordingly set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage, and most of the other Northcote-Trevelyan recommendations implemented over some years. This system was broadly endorsed by Commissions chaired by Playfair (1874), Ridley (1886), MacDonnell (1914), Tomlin (1931) and Priestley (1955).

Trois-Rivières ([tpl]IPA-fr|tʁwɑ.ʁi.vjɛʁ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-frdia|tʁwɔ.ʁi.vjaɛ̯ʁ|local|Qc-Trois-Rivières.ogg[/tpl]) is a city in the Mauricie administrative region of Quebec, Canada, located at the confluence of the Saint-Maurice and Saint Lawrence Rivers, on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River across from the city of Bécancour. It is part of the densely populated Quebec City–Windsor Corridor and is approximately halfway between Montreal and Quebec City. Trois-Rivières is the economic and cultural hub of the Mauricie region. It was founded on July 4, 1634, the second permanent settlement in New France,Roy-Sole, Monique. "A Tale of Tenacity", Canadian Geographic Magazine, April 2009, Vol. 129, No. 2, p. 31. after Quebec City in 1608.
The city's name, which is French for three rivers, is named for the fact that the Saint-Maurice River, which is divided by two small islands at the river's opening, has three mouths at the Saint Lawrence River. Traditionally, Trois-Rivières was referred to in English as Three Rivers, although in more recent decades it has been referred to as Trois-Rivières in both English and French. The anglicized name still appears in many areas of the town (e.g., the city's Three Rivers Academy), bearing witness to the influence of English settlers in the town.  The city's inhabitants are known as "Trifluviens" (Trifluvians).
Trois-Rivières is also the name of a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) of Quebec, coextensive with the city of Trois-Rivières. Its geographical code is 371. Together with the regional county municipality of Les Chenaux, it forms the census division (CD) of Francheville (37). The municipalities within Les Chenaux and the former municipalities that were amalgamated into Trois-Rivières formerly constituted the regional county municipality of Francheville. Trois-Rivières is the seat of the judicial district of the same name.Territorial Division Act. Revised Statutes of Quebec D-11. The Trois-Rivières metropolitan area also includes the city of Bécancour which is  situated on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River across the Laviolette Bridge.

Illiciales is an order of flowering plants that is not recognized by the current most widely used system of plant classification, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group's APG III system.[tpl]Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105–121 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122630309/abstract |accessdate=2010-12-10 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x [/tpl] The order was comprised differently in various systems of plant taxonomy, but is composed of 2-4 families of shrubs, trees, and lianas native to Australasia, south eastern Asia, and the southeastern United States. The families all contain species with essential oils, and flowers with a perianth with bracts (when present), sepals, and petals incompletely distinguished from each other and not arranged in definite whorls. The families of the order had been variably placed in other orders (Magnoliales, Austrobaileyales) in different taxonomies.
The Cronquist system, of 1981, recognized Illiciales as an order consisting of the families Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae and placed it in the subclass Magnoliidae, in class Magnoliopsida (or dicotyledons) of division Magnoliophyta (or angiosperms).
The Dahlgren system also recognised the order and placed it in superorder Magnolianae, in subclass Magnoliideae (Dahlgren's dicotyledons), in class Magnoliopsida with the same circumscription of families as the Chronquist system.
The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) does not recognize the order, initially leaving the family Illiciaceae unplaced as to order. In its second higher level taxonomy of angiosperms (APG II), the APG recognized Illicium and Schisandra as closely related taxa in the family Illiciaceae, and created the order Austrobaileyales with the families Illiciaceae, Trimeniaceae, and Austrobaileyaceae.Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2003).

[[Hierarchical database model]]

CATEGORIES: Database models

A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The structure allows representing information using parent/child relationships: each parent can have many children, but each child has only one parent (also known as a 1-to-many relationship). All attributes of a specific record are listed under an entity type.
In a database an entity type is the equivalent of a table. Each individual record is represented as a row, and each attribute as a column. Entity types are related to each other using 1:N mappings, also known as one-to-many relationships. This model is recognized as the first database model created by IBM in the 1960s.
Currently the most widely used hierarchical databases are IMS developed by IBM and Windows Registry by Microsoft.

[[Music of the Netherlands]]
CATEGORIES: Dutch composers, Dutch jazz musicians, Dutch music

The Netherlands has multiple musical traditions. Contemporary Dutch popular music (Nederpop) is heavily influenced by music styles that emerged in the 1950s, in the United Kingdom and United States. The style is sung in both Dutch and English. Some of the latter exponents, such as Golden Earring and Shocking Blue, have attained world wide fame. 
More traditional Dutch music however is a genre known as "Levenslied", meaning Song of/about life. These songs have catchy, simple rhythms and melodies, and are always built up on couplets and refrains. Themes are often sentimental and include love, death and loneliness.
Traditional Dutch musical instruments such as the accordion and the barrel organ are essential to levenslied, though in recent years many levenslied-artists also use synthesizers and guitars. Artists in this genre include Koos Alberts and the late André Hazes and Willy Alberti.
Dutch techno, hardstyle, gabber, trance and other styles in electronic dance music conquered the world. Some of the best known DJs in the EDM scene (and the world) hail from the Netherlands, including Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Sander van Doorn, Fedde le Grand, Hardwell  and Afrojack; all of whom consistently rank high in the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs and other rankings. The Amsterdam dance event (ADE) is the world's leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic sub-genres on the planet.
Also hip-hop in the Dutch language (nederhop) is very popular in the Netherlands and Belgium.

[[Torero]]

CATEGORIES: Spanish culture, Bullfighters

A torero ([tpl]IPA-es|toˈɾeɾo|lang[/tpl]) or toureiro ([tpl]IPA-pt|toˈɾɐjɾu|lang[/tpl]) is a bullfighter and the main performer in bullfighting, practised in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Peru, France and various other countries influenced by Spanish culture.http://www.networkeurope.org/feature/bullfighting-in-france-brutal-sport-or-national-culture In Spanish, the word torero describes any of the performers who actively participate in the bullfight. The main performer is the leader of an entourage and the one who kills the bull, being addressed as maestro (master) and his formal title is matador de toros (killer of bulls), but the word "matador" by itself is not used in Spanish. The term torero encompasses all who fight the bull in the ring (picadores and rejoneadores). The other bullfighters in the entourage are called subalternos and their suits are embroidered in silver as opposed to the matador's more-theatrical gold.  
An alternative word for torero is toreador in English (and in Bizet's opera Carmen), but this term (older than torero)[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] is not used in Spain and seldom in Latin America. 
A very small number of women have been bullfighters on foot or on horseback; one recent example being Cristina Sánchez. Female matadors have experienced considerable resistance and public hostility from aficionados and other matadors, perhaps being seen as a less physically nimble gender than the established norm.
Usually, toreros start fighting younger bulls (novillos or, more informally in some Latin American countries, vaquillas), and are called novilleros. Fighting of mature bulls commences only after a special match, called "the Alternative". At this same bullfight, the novillero (junior bullfighter) is presented to the crowd as a matador de toros.
The act of bullfighting is not called or considered a stand-alone sport but rather a performance art. There is no contest, simple punctuation, nor any formal classification. 
Further still, bullfighting, historically, started more with nobles upon horseback, all lancing bulls with accompanying commoners on foot doing helper jobs. As time went by, the work of the commoners on foot gained in importance up to the point whereupon they became the main and only act.  Bullfighting on horseback became a separate and distinct act called "rejoneo" which is still performed today--although, not as often as bullfighting itself does on foot.
Bullfighting on foot became a means for poor, able-bodied men to achieve fame and fortune. When a famous torero was asked why he risked his life, one man reportedly answered Más cornadas da el hambre ("Hunger strikes more painfully", lit. "Hunger gives more gores"). Today, it is now common for a bullfighter to be born into a family of bullfighters.
The established term, Maletilla  or espontáneo, is attributed to those who illegally jump into the ring and attempt to bullfight for their sake and glory. While the practice itself is widely despised by many spectators and fans alike, some, such as El Cordobés, started their very careers this way.

In ninety-nine, players bid for the number of tricks that they will take; players who gain exactly that number of tricks (no more or less) gain a significant bonus. One unusual feature of ninety-nine is that players bid by discarding three cards.

An illustration is  a visualization or a depiction made by an artist, such as a drawing, sketch, painting, photograph, or other  kind of image  of things seen, remembered or imagined, using a graphical representation. The word comes from the latin word illustra'tio,  illu'stro meaning  enlighten, irradiate. Printing is the current process for reproducing illustrations, typically with ink on paper using a printing press. Illustrations can be artistic images illustrating for example a text, poem, fashion,  magazines, stamps or a book and very often illustrations were made for children's books. The aim of an illustration is to elucidate or decorate a story, poem or piece of textual information by providing a visual representation of something described in the text. Illustrations can also represent scientific images of flora, medicine  or different processes, a biological or chemical processes or technical illustrations to give information on how to use something. Illustrations can be executed in different techniques, like watercolor, gouache, ink, oil, charcoal chalk or woodcut. Paintings are usually original works made on canvas or wood, while illustrations are printed. Illustrations are often carried out as a large-scale industrial process, and is an essential part of publishing and transaction printing.

[[Music of Hungary]]
CATEGORIES: Hungarian music

Hungary has made many contributions to the fields of folk, popular and classical music. Hungarian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity and continues to play a major part in Hungarian music.Broughton, pg. 159 Broughton claims that Hungary's "infectious sound has been surprisingly influential on neighbouring countries (thanks perhaps to the common Austro-Hungarian history) and it is not uncommon to hear Hungarian-sounding tunes in Romania, Slovakia and southern Poland".Szalipszki, pg.12 Refers to the country as "widely considered" to be a "home of music". It is also strong in the Szabolcs-Szatmár area and in the southwest part of Transdanubia, near the border with Croatia. The Busójárás carnival in Mohács is a major Hungarian folk music event, formerly featuring the long-established and well-regarded Bogyiszló orchestra.Broughton, pg. 159-167
Hungarian classical music has long been an "experiment, made from Hungarian antedecents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture the musical world of the folk song".Szabolcsi, The Specific Conditions of Hungarian Musical Development "Every experiment, made from Hungarian antedecents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture (music written by composers, as different from folk music), had instinctively or consciously striven to develop widely and universally the musical world of the folk song. Folk poetry and folk music were deeply embedded in the collective Hungarian people’s culture, and this unity did not cease to be effective even when it was given from and expression by individual creative artists, performers and poets." Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.Szabolcsi For example, Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, two of Hungary's most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their music. Bartók collected folk songs from across Eastern Europe, including Romania and Slovakia, whilst Kodály was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style.
During the era of Communist rule in Hungary (1949–1989) a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity. Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of jazz such as trumpeter Rudolf Tomsits, pianist-composer Károly Binder and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, Ferenc Sebő and Márta Sebestyén. The three giants of Hungarian rock, Illés, Metró and Omega, remain very popular, especially Omega, which has followings in Germany and beyond as well as in Hungary. Older veteran underground bands such as Beatrice from the 1980s also remain popular.

[[Revenue]]
CATEGORIES: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Microeconomics, Income

In business, revenue or turnover is income that a company receives from its normal business activities, usually from the sale of goods and services to customers. In many countries, revenue is referred to as turnover.
Some companies receive revenue from interest, royalties, or other fees.[tpl]cite book |author=Joseph V. Carcello |title=Financial & Managerial Accounting |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin |year=2008 |pages=199 |isbn=978-0-07-299650-0[/tpl] This definition is based on IAS 18. Revenue may refer to business income in general, or it may refer to the amount, in a monetary unit, received during a period of time, as in "Last year, Company X had revenue of $42 million."
Profits or net income generally imply total revenue minus total expenses in a given period. In accounting, revenue is often referred to as the "top line" due to its position on the income statement at the very top. This is to be contrasted with the "bottom line" which denotes net income.Williams, p.51
For non-profit organizations, annual revenue may be referred to as gross receipts.2006 Instructions for Form 990 and Form 990-EZ, US Department of the Treasury, p. 22 This revenue includes donations from individuals and corporations, support from government agencies, income from activities related to the organization's mission, and income from fundraising activities, membership dues, and financial investments such as stock shares in companies.
In general usage, revenue is income received by an organization in the form of cash or cash equivalents. Sales revenue or revenues is income received from selling goods or services over a period of time. Tax revenue is income that a government receives from taxpayers.
In more formal usage, revenue is a calculation or estimation of periodic income based on a particular standard accounting practice or the rules established by a government or government agency. Two common accounting methods, cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting, do not use the same process for measuring revenue. Corporations that offer shares for sale to the public are usually required by law to report revenue based on generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards.
In a double-entry bookkeeping system, revenue accounts are general ledger accounts that are summarized periodically under the heading Revenue or Revenues on an income statement. Revenue account names describe the type of revenue, such as "Repair service revenue", "Rent revenue earned" or "Sales".Williams, p. 196

[[Ceratophyllum]]

CATEGORIES: Angiosperm genera, Aquatic plants, Angiosperms

Ceratophyllum is a cosmopolitan genus of flowering plants, commonly found in ponds, marshes, and quiet streams in tropical and in temperate regions. They are usually called hornworts, although this name is also used for unrelated plants of the division Anthocerotophyta.
Ceratophyllum grows completely submerged, usually, though not always, floating on the surface, and does not tolerate drought. The plant stems can reach 1–3 m in length. At intervals along nodes of the stem they produce rings of bright green leaves, which are narrow and often much-branched. The forked leaves are brittle and stiff to the touch in some species, softer in others. The plants have no roots at all, but sometimes they develop modified leaves with a rootlike appearance, which anchor the plant to the bottom. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the male and female flowers on the same plant. In ponds it forms thick buds (turions) in the autumn that sink to the bottom which give the impression that it has been killed by the frost but come spring these will grow back into the long stems slowly filling up the pond.Flora of China: CeratophyllumFlora of North America: CeratophyllumBlamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C.

Hornwort plants float in great numbers just under the surface. They offer excellent protection to fish-spawn, but also to snails, infected with bilharzia. Because of their appearance and their high oxygen production, they are often used in freshwater aquaria.

[[Music of Sudan]]

CATEGORIES: Sudanese music

Sudan has a rich and unique musical culture that has been through chronic instability and repression during the modern history of Sudan.
Beginning with the imposition of strict sharia law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent musicians and poets, like poet Mahjoub Sharif, were imprisoned while others, like Mohammed el Amin and Mohammed Wardi, fled to Cairo (Mohammed el amin returned to Sudan in 1991 and Mohammed Wardi returned to Sudan in 2003). Traditional music suffered too, with traditional Zār ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated.[tpl]cite book |author=Broughton, Simon and Mark Ellingham (eds) with James McConnachie and Orla Duane |publisher=Rough Guides Ltd. |year=2000 |title=Rough Guide to World Music, Vol. 1 |isbn=1-85828-636-0[/tpl] - "Yearning to Dance" by Verney, Peter with Helen Jerome and Moawia Yassin, pgs. 672-680  At the same time, however, the European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish bagpipes, were renowned, and set traditional music to military march music. The march March Shulkawi No 1, is an example, set to the sounds of the Shilluk.
Sudan is very diverse, with five hundred plus ethnic groups spread across the country's territory, which is the largest in Africa. The country has been a crossroads between North, East and West Africa for hundreds of years, and is inhabited by a mixture of Sub-Saharan Arabs and Africans.

[[Music of Ethiopia]]
CATEGORIES: Ethiopian music

The music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of Ethiopia's ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds.  Some forms of traditional music are strongly influenced by folk music from elsewhere in the Horn of Africa. However, Ethiopian religious music also has an ancient Christian element, traced to Yared, who lived during the reign of Gabra Masqal. In northeastern Ethiopia, in Wollo, a Muslim musical form called manzuma developed.  Sung in Amharic, manzuma has spread to Harar and Jimma, where it is now sung in the Oromo language.  In the Ethiopian Highlands, traditional secular music is played by mostly itinerant musicians called azmaris, who are regarded with both suspicion and respect in Ethiopian society.

[[Mimicry]]
CATEGORIES: Mimicry, Polymorphism, Camouflage, Warning coloration

In evolutionary biology, mimicry is the similarity of one species to another which protects one or both.[tpl]cite book | last=King | first=R. C. | last2=Stansfield | first2=W. D. | last3=Mulligan | first3=P. K. | year=2006 | title=A dictionary of genetics | edition=7th | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | page=278 | isbn=0-19-530762-3 [/tpl] This similarity can be in appearance, behaviour, sound, scent and location. The mimics are found in similar places to their models. 
Mimicry occurs when a group of organisms,This "group" is often a species, but can also be a subgroup such as one particular sex or morph the mimics, evolve to share common perceived characteristics with another group, the models.In its broadest definition mimicry can include non-living models. The evolution is driven by the selective action of a signal-receiver or dupe.[tpl]cite journal | author=Wickler, W. | authorlink=Wolfgang Wickler | year=1965 | title=Mimicry and the evolution of animal communication | journal=Nature| volume=208 | issue=5010| pages =519–21 | doi =10.1038/208519a0 |bibcode = 1965Natur.208..519W [/tpl] Birds, for example, use sight to identify palatable insects (the mimics), whilst avoiding the noxious models. 
The model is usually another species except in cases of automimicry. The signal-receiver is typically another intermediate organism like the common predator of two species, but may actually be the model itself, such as a moth resembling its spider predator.{{cite web | url=http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/12/22/the-moth-in-spiders-clothing/ | title=A moth in spider's clothing Mimicry is related to camouflage, in which a species resembles its surroundings or is otherwise difficult to detect. In particular, mimesis, in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism, but one to which the dupe is indifferent, is an area of overlap between camouflage and mimicry.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pasteur, G. | date = 1982 | title = A classificatory review of mimicry systems |  journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 169–199 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 [/tpl] For example, animals such as flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars that resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers are mimetic.p51 Crypsis (in the broad sense) is sometimes used to encompass all forms of avoiding detection, such as mimicry, camouflage and hiding.[tpl]cite book | author=Ruxton, G. D.; T. N. Sherratt, and M. P. Speed | date=2004 | title=Avoiding attack: the evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals, and mimicry | publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl]
Though visual mimicry is most obvious to humans, other senses such as olfaction (smell) or hearing may be involved, and more than one type of signal may be employed.[tpl]cite book | author=Wickler, W. | year=1968 | title=Mimicry in plants and animals | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York [/tpl] Mimicry may involve morphology, behaviour, and other properties. In any case, the signal always functions to deceive the receiver by preventing it from correctly identifying the mimic. In evolutionary terms, this phenomenon is a form of co-evolution usually involving an evolutionary arms race.p161 It should not be confused with convergent evolution, which occurs when species come to resemble one another independently by adapting to similar lifestyles.
Mimics may have different models for different life cycle stages, or they may be polymorphic, with different individuals imitating different models. Models themselves may have more than one mimic, though frequency dependent selection favors mimicry where models outnumber mimics. Models tend to be relatively closely related organisms, but mimicry of vastly different species is also known. Most known mimics are insects, though many other animal mimics, including mammals, are known. Plants and fungi may also be mimics, though less research has been carried out in this area.[tpl]cite journal | author=Boyden, T.

[[Abelian variety]]

CATEGORIES: Abelian varieties, Algebraic curves, Geometry of divisors, Algebraic surfaces, Niels Henrik Abel

In mathematics, particularly in algebraic geometry, complex analysis and number theory, an abelian variety is a projective algebraic variety that is also an algebraic group, i.e., has a group law that can be defined by regular functions. Abelian varieties are at the same time among the most studied objects in algebraic geometry and indispensable tools for much research on other topics in algebraic geometry and number theory.
An abelian variety can be defined by equations having coefficients in any field; the variety is then said to be defined over that field. Historically the first abelian varieties to be studied were those defined over the field of complex numbers. Such abelian varieties turn out to be exactly those complex tori that can be embedded into a complex  projective space. Abelian varieties defined over algebraic number fields are a special case, which is important also from the viewpoint of number theory. Localization techniques lead naturally from abelian varieties defined over number fields to ones defined over finite fields and various local fields.
Abelian varieties appear naturally as Jacobian varieties (the connected components of zero in Picard varieties) and Albanese varieties of other algebraic varieties.  The group law of an abelian variety is necessarily commutative and the variety is non-singular. An elliptic curve is an abelian variety of dimension 1. Abelian varieties have Kodaira dimension 0.

[[Music of Dominica]]
CATEGORIES: Dominica music

The music of Dominica includes a variety of genres including all the popular genres of the world. Popular music is widespread, with a number of native Dominican performers gaining national fame in imported genres such as calypso, reggae, soca, konpa, zouk and rock and roll. Dominica's own popular music industry has created a form called bouyon, which combines elements from several styles and has achieved a wide fanbase in Dominica. Groups include WCK (Windward Caribbean Kulture), Native musicians in various forms, like reggae (Nasio Fontaine, Lazo, Brother Matthew Luke), kadans (Ophelia Marie, (Exile One, Grammacks) and calypso (The Wizzard), have also become stars at home and abroad.
There is also "Cadence-lypso", the Dominica kadans, which has influenced other genres including zouk, bouyon (another Dominican creation) and soca music.
Like the other Francophone musics of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican folk music is a hybrid of African and European elements. The quadrille is an important symbol of French Antillean culture, and is, on Dominica, typically accompanied by a kind of ensemble called a jing ping band. In addition, Dominica's folk tradition includes folk songs called bélé, traditional storytelling called kont, masquerade, children's and work songs, and Carnival music.
Until the late 1950's, the Afro-Dominican culture of most of the island was repressed by the colonial government and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, both of which taught that African-derived music was evil, demonic and uncultured.[tpl]cite journal|author=Philip, Daryl|title=Twenty Years of Traditional/Folk Dance in Dominica|version=Thesis for a certificate in dance education|publisher=Jamaica School of Dance|year=1986[/tpl] cited in Guilbault, pp. 840–844.

Traditionally, the word "tiara" refers to a high crown, often with the shape of a cylinder narrowed at its top, made of fabric or leather, and richly ornamented. It was used by the kings and emperors of some ancient peoples in Anatolia and Mesopotamia, notably the Hittites. The Assyrians and the inhabitants of the Indus Valley Civilization used to include a pair of bull horns as a decoration and symbol of authority and a circle of short feathers surrounding the tiara's top. The Iranic tiara was more similar to a truncated cone, without the horns and feathers but more jewels, and a conic-shaped tip at its top.

In modern French "pendant" is the gerund form of “hanging” (also meaning “during”).
One of the earliest types of bodily adornment is the pendant. Primeval man liked to put a tiny hole in a beautiful rock and slip a string usually made of grass or vine so it could be hung around the neck. Shells and other indigenous materials could also be used. In Ancient Egypt, Pharaohs normally wore scarab beetle pendants to symbolize their wealth and power.

They were envisioned as the ghosts of those who were not buried properly.  They were considered vengeful toward the living and might possess people if they did not respect certain taboos, such as the prohibition against eating ox meat.  They were thought to cause disease and inspire criminal behavior in the living, but could sometimes be appeased by funeral repasts or libations.  The edimmu were also thought to be completely or nearly incorporeal, "wind" spirits that sucked the life out of the susceptible and the sleeping (most commonly the young).

[[Irkalla]]
CATEGORIES: Mesopotamian mythology, Mythological cosmologies, Afterlife places

In Babylonian mythology, Irkalla (also Ir-Kalla, Irkalia) is the underworld from which there is no return. It is also called Arali, Kigal, Gizal, and the lower world. Irkalla is ruled by the goddess Ereshkigal and her consort, the death god Nergal.
Irkalla was originally another name for Ereshkigal, who ruled the underworld alone until Nergal was sent to the underworld and seduced Ereshkigal (in Babylonian mythology). Both the deity and the location were called Irkalla, much like how Hades in Greek mythology is both the name of the underworld and the god who ruled it.
The Sumerian netherworld was a place for the bodies of the dead to exist after death. One passed through the seven gates on their journey through the portal to the netherworld leaving articles of clothing and adornment at each gate, not necessarily by choice as there was a guardian at each gate to extract a toll for one's passage and to keep one from going the wrong way. The living spirits of the dead are only spoken of in connection with this netherworld when someone has been placed here before they are dead or wrongly killed and can be saved. The bodies of the dead decompose in this afterlife, as they would in the world above. 
As the subterranean destination for all who die, Irkalla is similar to Sheol of the Hebrew Bible or Hades of classic Greek mythology. It is different from more hopeful versions of the afterlife, such as those envisioned by the contemporaneous Egyptians and the later in Platonic philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. However, Irkalla also differs from the Greek Tartarus and the Christian perspective of hell. Irkalla had no punishment or reward, being seen as a more dreary version of life above, with Erishkigal being seen as both warden and guardian of the dead rather than a sinister ruler like Satan or death gods of other religions.

Kur was sometimes the home of the dead,http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm "Sumerian Mythology"] by Samuel Noah Kramer p.110 passim it is possible that the flames on escaping gas plumes in parts of the Zagros mountains would have given those mountains a meaning not entirely consistent with the primary meaning of mountains and an abode of a god.  The eastern mountains as an abode of the god is popular in Ancient Near Eastern mythology.
It is likely that this name coincides with the  modern day Kurds who are the predominant ethnicity inhabiting much of the Zagros mountain range.Hennerbichler believes the term Kurd and similar ethnic labels to have been derived from the Sumerian word stem “kur”, meaning mountain. Hennenrbichler. (2012). The Origin of Kurds. Advances in Anthropology, 2.2: pp. 64-79. In modern Kurdish language, kur is the word for boy.
The underworld Kur is the void space between the primeval sea (Abzu) and the earth (Ma).
Kur is almost identical with "Ki-gal", "Great Land" which is the Underworld (thus the ruler of the Underworld is Ereshkigal "Goddess of The Great Land".  In later Babylonian myth Kur is possibly an Anunnaki, brother of Ereshkigal, Inanna, Enki, and Enlil.  In the Enuma Elish in Akkadian tablets from the first millennium BC, Kur is part of the retinue of Tiamat, and seems to be a snakelike dragon.  In one story the slaying of the great serpent Kur results in the flooding of the earth.http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm "Sumerian Mythology"] by Samuel Noah Kramer, p. 112  A first millennium BC cylinder seal shows a fire-spitting winged dragon—a nude woman between its wings—pulling the chariot of the god who subdued it, another depicts a god riding a dragon, a third a goddess.http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm "Sumerian Mythology"] by Samuel Noah Kramer, p. 114

The sex-positive movement is a social movement which promotes and embraces sexuality with few limits beyond an emphasis on safe sex and the importance of informed consent.  Sex positivity is "an attitude towards human sexuality that regards all consensual sexual activities as fundamentally healthy and pleasurable, and encourages sexual pleasure and experimentation.  The sex-positive movement is a social and philosophical movement that advocates these attitudes. The sex-positive movement advocates sex education and safer sex as part of its campaign."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.sexpositiveculture.org/blog/zblogentry.2008-02-26.0976756799|title=A Sex Positive Renaissance|first=Allena|last=Gabosch|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2011-02-15[/tpl]  The movement generally makes no moral distinctions among types of sexual activities, regarding these choices as matters of personal preference.

|classification=Double reed

The shawm was a medieval and Renaissance musical instrument of the woodwind family made in Europe from the 12th century (at the latest) until the 17th century. It was likely of ancient origin and was imported to Europe from the Islamic East at some point between the 9th and 12th centuries. Its name is linguistically related to the Arabic zamr, the Turkish zūrnā, the Persian surnāy, the Chinese suona, the Javanese saruni, and the Hindu sahanai or sanayi.Anthony C. Baines and Martin Kirnbauer, "Shawm shalm, shalmie, schalmuse", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). It is the predecessor of the modern oboe. The body of the shawm was usually turned from a single piece of wood, and terminated in a flared bell somewhat like that of a trumpet. Beginning in the 16th century, shawms were made in several sizes, from sopranino to great bass, and four and five-part music could be played by a consort consisting entirely of shawms.
All later shawms (excepting the smallest) had at least one key allowing a downward extension of the compass; the keywork was typically covered by a perforated wooden cover called the fontanelle. The bassoon-like double reed, made from the same Arundo donax cane used for oboes and bassoons, was inserted directly into a socket at the top of the instrument, or in the larger types, on the end of a metal tube called the bocal. The pirouette, a small cylindrical piece of wood with a hole in the middle resembling a thimble, was placed over the reed—this acted as a support for the lips and embouchure.
Since only a short portion of the reed protruded past the pirouette, the player had only limited contact with the reed, and therefore limited control of dynamics.  The shawm’s conical bore and flaring bell, combined with the style of playing dictated by the use of a pirouette, gave the instrument a piercing, trumpet-like sound well-suited for out-of-doors performance.

Although widely recognized in most plant classifications (notably the Cronquist system), the more recent gene-based APG system (1998) and the APG II system (2003) have included these plants in the family Amaranthaceae on the basis of evidence from molecular phylogenies: they are a paraphyletic group, so that for a monophyletic taxon, merger with Amaranthaceae sensu stricto was needed.

The Riemann–Roch theorem is an important tool in mathematics, specifically in complex analysis and algebraic geometry, for the computation of the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with prescribed zeroes and allowed poles. It relates the complex analysis of a connected compact Riemann surface with the surface's purely topological genus g, in a way that can be carried over into purely algebraic settings.
Initially proved as Riemann's inequality by [tpl]harvtxt|Riemann|1857[/tpl], the theorem reached its definitive form for Riemann surfaces after work of Riemann's short-lived student [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink=Gustav Roch|first=Gustav|last=Roch|year=1865[/tpl].

[[Extended family]]

CATEGORIES: Family, Living arrangements

The term extended family defines a family that extends beyond the immediate family, consisting of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins all living nearby or in the same household. An example is a married couple that lives with either the husband or the wife's parents. The family changes from immediate household to extended household. 
[tpl]cite web|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Extended_family.aspx|work=Family Extended[/tpl] In some circumstances, the extended family comes to live either with or in place of a member of the immediate family. These families include, in one household, near relatives in addition to an immediate family. An example would be an elderly parent who moves in with his or her children due to old age. This places large demands on the caregivers, particularly on the female relatives who choose to perform these duties for their extended family. In modern Western cultures dominated by immediate family constructs, the term has come to be used generically to refer to grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, whether they live together within the same household or not.Andersen, Margaret L and Taylor, Howard Francis (2007). The extended family may live together for many reasons, such as to help raise children, support for an ill relative, or help with financial problems. Sociology: Understanding a diverse society. p. 396 ISBN 0-495-00742-0. However, it may also refer to a family unit in which several generations live together within a single household. In some cultures, the term is used synonymously with consanguineous family.
In a stem family, a type of extended family, first presented by Frédéric Le Play,[tpl]cite journal|last=Ruggles|first=Steven|title=Stem Families and Joint Families In Comparative Historical Perspective|journal=Population And Development Review|year=2010|volume=36|issue=3|pages=563–577|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057610/|accessdate=June 12, 2013[/tpl] parents will live with one child and his or her spouse, as well as the children of both, while other children will leave the house or remain in it unmarried. The stem family is sometimes associated with inegalitarian inheritance practices, as in Japan and Korea, but the term has also been used in some contexts to describe a family type where parents live with a married child and his or her spouse and children, but the transfer of land and moveable property is more or less egalitarian, as in the case of traditional Romania,Gender and Well-Being  Interactions between Work, Family and Public Policies  COST ACTION A 34  Second Symposium:  The Transmission of Well-Being: Marriage Strategies  and Inheritance Systems in Europe (17th-20th Centuries)  25th -28th April 2007  University of Minho  Guimarães-Portugal http://www.ub.edu/tig/GWBNet/MinhoPapers/Constanta%20Ghitulescu.pdf northeastern ThailandAnthropological Demography: Toward a New Synthesis  Written By David I.

In an extended family, parents and their children's families may often live under a single roof. This type of joint family often includes multiple generations in the family. From culture to culture, the variance of the term may have different meanings. For instance, in India, the family is a patriarchal society, with the sons' families often staying in the same house.
In the joint family set-up, the workload is shared among the members, often unequally. The roles of women are often restricted to housewives and this usually involves cooking, cleaning, and organizing for the entire family. The patriarch of the family (often the oldest male member) lays down the rules and arbitrates disputes. Other senior members of the household babysit infants in case their mother is working. They are also responsible in teaching the younger children their mother tongue, manners, and etiquette. Grandparents often take the leading roles due to the fact that they have the most experience with parenting and maintaining a household. Amy Goyer, AARP multigenerational issues expert, said the most common multigenerational household is one with a grandparent as head of household and his adult children having moved in with their children, an arrangement usually spurred by the needs of one or both to combine resources and save money. The second most popular is a grandparent moving in with an adult child's family, usually for care-giving reasons. She noted that 2.5 million grandparents say they are responsible for the basic needs of the grandchild living with them.Bulik, B. (2010). We Are Family-And More Of Us Are Living Under One Roof. (Cover story). Advertising Age, 81(30), 1-20.
The house often has a large reception area and a common kitchen. Each family has their own bedroom.[tpl]citationneeded|date=December 2013[/tpl] The members of the household also look after each other when a member  is ill.

Autobianchi ([tpl]IPA-it|autoˈbjaŋki[/tpl]) was an Italian automobile manufacturer, created jointly by Bianchi, Pirelli and Fiat in 1955. Autobianchi produced only a handful of models during its lifetime, which were almost exclusively small cars, with the biggest being the short-lived Autobianchi A111, a small family car. Autobianchis were priced higher than Fiat models of similar size and the brand was used by Fiat to test new and innovative concepts which later found their way into mainstream Fiat vehicles; these concepts included fibreglass bodies and front-wheel drive.
The most famous Autobianchi models include the A112 released in 1969, a small hatchback very popular in Italy for racing, and which ceased production in 1986; as well as the Y10, which was the first car to use Fiat's new FIRE (Fully Integrated Robotised Engine). The Primula was the car with which Fiat introduced the particular front-wheel drive arrangement of engine, transmission and differential (final drive) that has become prevalent in its cars today. This car competed with the Innocenti-built Mini, which was the inspiration for the drivetrain layout.
Autobianchi was bought by the Fiat group and integrated into the operations of Lancia. The marque survived in Italy until the end of the Y10's production in 1995, but became extinct elsewhere when the model was rebranded as a Lancia in 1989.

The  Las Vegas 51s, formerly known as the Las Vegas Stars, are a minor league baseball team. As of the 2013 baseball season, the 51s are the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Mets. This marks the Mets' third Triple-A affiliate change since their 37-year affiliation with the Norfolk Tides ended after the 2006 season (the New Orleans Zephyrs and Buffalo Bisons have also served as New York's AAA affiliate since 2007). The 51s were most recently the Triple-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, who have since taken the Mets' place as Buffalo's major league parent club.
They play at Cashman Field (capacity 9,334) in Las Vegas, Nevada. The team competes in the Pacific Coast League (PCL). The 51s won the PCL championship as the Stars in 1986 and 1988.
The 51s take their name from Area 51 which is located near Rachel, Nevada, about 80 miles north of Las Vegas, although the route that must be taken by car to get there takes about three hours of travel. The team logo jokingly depicts one of the grey aliens thought by UFO believers to inhabit that base.
In April 2013, the team was purchased by Summerlin Las Vegas Baseball Club LLC, a joint venture of Howard Hughes Corp. and Play Ball Owners Group, including investors Steve Mack, Bart Wear and Chris Kaempfer, with intentions of moving it to a new proposed stadium of $60 million, in Summerlin near the Red Rock Resort Spa and Casino. Summerlin is an affluent neighborhood in the western area of Las Vegas. Possible obstacles are the effects on property values and quality of life, in addition to potential stress on the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area ecology.http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/may/20/some-pacific-coast-league-stadiums-will-be-tough-p/

[[Partial fraction decomposition]]

CATEGORIES: Algebra, Elementary algebra, Partial fractions

In algebra, the partial fraction decomposition or partial fraction expansion of a rational fraction (that is a fraction such that the numerator and the denominator are both polynomials) is the operation that consists in expressing the fraction as a sum of a polynomial (possibly zero) and one or several fractions with a simpler denominator.
The importance of the partial fraction decomposition lies in the fact that it provides an algorithm for computing the antiderivative of a rational function.
In symbols, one can use partial fraction expansion to change a rational fraction in the form
where ƒ and g are polynomials, into an expression of the form
where gj (x) are polynomials that are factors of g(x), and are in general of lower degree. 
Thus, the partial fraction decomposition may be seen as the inverse procedure of the more elementary operation of addition of rational fractions, which produces a single rational fraction with a numerator and denominator usually of high degree.
The full decomposition pushes the reduction as far as it will go: in other words, the factorization of g is used as much as possible. Thus, the outcome of a full partial fraction expansion expresses that fraction as a sum of fractions, where:

Marcel André Henri Félix Petiot (17 January 1897 – 25 May 1946) was a French doctor and serial killer. He was convicted of multiple murders after the discovery of the remains of 23 people in his home in Paris during World War II.

[[Free abelian group]]
CATEGORIES: Abelian group theory, Properties of groups, Free algebraic structures

In abstract algebra, a free abelian group or free Z-module is an abelian group with a basis.
That is, it is a set together with an associative, commutative, and invertible binary operation,
and its basis is a subset of its elements
such that every element of the group can be written in one and only one way as a linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients, finitely many of which are nonzero. Familiar examples include the integers (with the group operation being addition and the basis equal to the singleton set {1}) and the integer lattices.  The elements of a free abelian group with basis B are also known as formal sums over B.  Informally, formal sums may also be seen as signed multisets with elements in B. Free abelian groups and formal sums have applications in algebraic topology, where they are used to define chain groups, and in algebraic geometry, where they are used to define divisors.
Every set B has a unique free abelian group with B as its basis. This group may be constructed as a direct sum of copies of the additive group of the integers, with one copy per member of B. Its elements may be interpreted as the functions from B to the integers that have finitely many nonzero values, and its group operation is pointwise addition of these functions. Alternatively, the free abelian group with basis B may be described by a presentation with the elements of B as its generators and with the commutators of pairs of members as its relators.
Free abelian groups have properties which make them similar to vector spaces and allow a general abelian group to be understood as a quotient of a free abelian group by "relations".  Every free abelian group has a rank defined as the cardinality of a basis.  The rank determines the group up to isomorphism, and the elements of such a group can be written as finite formal sums of the basis elements.  Every subgroup of a free abelian group is itself free abelian, which allows the description of a general abelian group as a cokernel of an injective homomorphism between free abelian groups.

The Department for International Development (DFID) is a United Kingdom government department with a Cabinet Minister in charge. It was separated from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1997. The goal of the department is "to promote sustainable development and eliminate world poverty". The current Secretary of State for International Development is Justine Greening. A 2010 reporthttp://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/OECD-DAC-UK-Peer-Review-Report-July2010.pdf by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) identified DFID as 'an international development leader in times of global crisis'.
DFID's main programme areas of work are Education, Health, Social Services, Water Supply and Sanitation, Government and Civil Society, Economic Sector (including Infrastructure, Production Sectors and Developing Planning), Environment Protection, Research, and Humanitarian Assistance.
In 2009/10 DFID’s Gross Public Expenditure on Development was £6.65bn. Of this £3.96bn was spent on Bilateral Aid (including debt relief, humanitarian assistance and project funding) and £2.46bn was spent on Multilateral Aid (including support to the EU, World Bank, UN and other related agencies).http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/departmental-report/2010/dfid-in-2009-10-revised-6-sept-2010.pdf Although the Department for International Development’s foreign aid budget was not affected by the cuts outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s 2010 spending review, DFID will see their administration budgets slashed by approximately 19 percent over the next four years. This would mean a reduction in back-office costs to account for only 2 percent of their total spend by 2015.http://www.devex.com/en/articles/70405?source=EM+DefaultHomepage_Center_3
In June 2013 as part of the 2013 Spending Round outcomes it was announced that DFID's total programme budget would increase to £10.3bn in 2014/15 and £11.1bn in 2015/16 to help meet the UK government's commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI (Gross National Income) on ODA (Official Development Assistance). DFID is responsible for the majority of UK ODA; projected to total £11.7bn in 2014/15 and £12.2bn in 2015/16.2013 Spending Round Outcomes: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/209036/spending-round-2013-complete.pdf
The National Audit Office (NAO) 2009 Performance Management review http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0809/dfid_progress_in_improving_pe.aspx looks at how DFID has restructured its performance management arrangements over the last 6 years. The report responded to a request from DFID’s Accounting Officer to re-visit the topic periodically, which the Comptroller and Auditor General agreed would be valuable. The study found that DFID had improved in its general scrutiny of progress in reducing poverty and of progress towards divisional goals, however noted that there was still clear scope for further improvement.

[[Stirling cycle]]
CATEGORIES: Thermodynamic cycles, Stirling engines

The Stirling cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that describes the general class of Stirling devices.  This includes the original Stirling engine that was invented, developed and patented in 1816 by Reverend Dr. Robert Stirling with help from his brother, an engineer.[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Sier|title=Hot air caloric and stirling engines. Vol.1, A history|edition=1st Edition (Revised)|publisher=L.A. Mair|year=1999|isbn=0-9526417-0-4[/tpl]
The cycle is reversible, meaning that if supplied with mechanical power, it can function as a heat pump for heating or cooling, and even for cryogenic cooling.  The cycle is defined as a closed regenerative cycle with a gaseous working fluid.  "Closed cycle" means the working fluid is permanently contained within the thermodynamic system.  This also categorizes the engine device as an external heat engine. "Regenerative" refers to the use of an internal heat exchanger called a regenerator which increases the device's thermal efficiency.
The cycle is the same as most other heat cycles in that there are four main processes: compression, heat addition, expansion, and heat removal.  However, these processes are not discrete, but rather the transitions overlap.
The Stirling cycle is a highly advanced subject that has defied analysis by many experts for over 190 years.  Highly advanced thermodynamics is required to describe the cycle.  Professor Israel Urieli writes: "...the various 'ideal' cycles (such as the Schmidt cycle) are neither physically realizable nor representative of the Stirling cycle".Organ, "The Regenerator and the Stirling Engine", p.xxii, Forward by Urieli
The analytical problem of the regenerator (the central heat exchanger in the Stirling cycle) is judged by Jakob to rank "among the most difficult and involved that are encountered in engineering".Organ, "The Regenerator and the Stirling Engine", p.7Jakob, M.

Physiognomy (from the Gk. physis meaning "nature" and gnomon meaning "judge" or "interpreter") is the assessment of a person's character or personality from his or her outer appearance, especially the face. The term can also refer to the general appearance of a person, object, or terrain, without reference to its implied characteristics, as in the physiognomy of a plant community.
Credence of such study has varied from time to time. The practice was well-accepted by the ancient Greek philosophers, but fell into disrepute in the Middle Ages when practised by vagabonds and mountebanks. It was then revived and popularised by Johann Kaspar Lavater before falling from favour again in the late 19th century. Physiognomy as understood in the past meets the contemporary definition of a pseudoscience.[tpl]Cite book |chapter= Marginalized practices |title= The Cambridge History of Science: Eighteenth-century science |volume= 4 |series= The Cambridge History of Science |author= Roy Porter|edition= illustrated |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2003 |pages= 495–497 |isbn= 978-0-521-57243-9 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=KDSqLsOHc9UC&pg=PA497&dq=Physiognomy+pseudoscience#v=onepage&q=Physiognomy%20pseudoscience&f=false |quote= Although we may now bracket physiognomy with Mesmerism as discredited or even laughable belief, many eighteenth-century writers referred to it in all seriousness as a useful science with a long history(...) Although many modern historians belittle physiognomy as a pseudoscience, at the end of the eighteenth century it was not merely a popular fad but also the subject of intense academic debate about the promises it held for future progress. [/tpl]
No clear evidence indicates physiognomy works, though recent studies have suggested that facial appearances do "contain a kernel of truth" about a person's personality.

They have struggled somewhat in recent years, although they did win the Central League title in 2000. Playing in the vicinity of Rangers they struggle to maintain a decent level of support.
The origins of the club name are somewhat hazy, although it has been suggested that it has its roots in Northern Ireland, with a village of the same name being located there. The suggestion is that they were formed by Northern Irish immigrants to Glasgow.
Until March 2014, Benburb were based at Tinto Park in Glasgow's Govan district. Plans for a new ground - to be built close to Tinto Park - have been announced.
The club colours are blue and white. They recently employed a new physiotherapist, Amin Hussain, who is set to stay and assist the team.

 '''Johnstone Burgh''' are a Scottish [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Johnstone]], [[Renfrewshire]], and play in [[Scottish Junior Football Central Division One|Central Division One]] of the [[Scottish Junior Football Association]], West Region.
The club were formed in 1956, in response to an article in the "Johnstone & Linwood Gazette" newspaper from a journalist that had been ordered out of the newspaper's office on the corner of Johnstone's Rankine Street by the office manager with instructions not to return until he had a story. The journalist proceeded to ask locals what they thought about forming a new football club to replace the former Scottish league side Johnstone.
Since their foundation, "The Burgh," have been based at James Y. Keanie Park (named after the builder who donated the land The club was built upon), but have much-delayed plans afoot to relocate within the next couple of years to a new ground at the more central Thomas Shanks Memorial Park less than one mile away, built in conjunction with the local council: the perpetually poor drainage at Keanie Park resulting in the regular postponement of home fixtures during the winter months has been a severe financial drain on the side.
Their most successful period was in the late fifties and sixties when they twice won junior footballs top prize - the Scottish Junior Cup.  Probably their most successful manager was Jimmy Blackburn who led them to both their Scottish Cup wins as well as West of Scotland Cup and Central League Championship wins.  One of our local lads, Bobby Dick, who hails from Elderslie, played what was then right half for the Burgh, and can boast two Scottish Cup winners medals as well as a number of other winners medals.  In those days the cup final was played at Hampden Park, which made it a day to remember.   In later years Bobby's nephew Alan Donohoe played in goal for the Burgh and was involved in their cup final of 2000.
The 1968-1969 season was Johnstone Burgh's most successful season. They won the Scottish Junior Cup, beating Glenrothes 2-1 in extra time after a 2-2 draw at Hampden in the first match. Hugh Gilshan scored the winner. The team also won the First division Championship and the Evening Times Trophy that season. 
Johnstone Burgh have a home support of around 100–150, though this tends to increase vastly when the team is doing well. An OVD Cup tie between Johnstone Burgh and Glenafton Athletic in February 2000 attracted a crowd of over 2000. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] 
In the 2000 Scottish Junior Cup Final against Whitburn, goals by Colin Lindsay, who later had a spell as manager, and John McLay took the game to penalties after a 2–2 draw. Johnstone Burgh won on penalties in their semi-final at Love Street, but failed to repeat this success in the final.
Johnstone Burgh play in red tops, white shorts and red socks. The current manager of the team is George Walker, the assistant manager is Eddie McKim. Ex players David Brolly & Alan Donohoe are also part of the coaching staff.

CATEGORIES: Serinus, Bird genera

The genus Serinus is a large genus of birds in the finch family Fringillidae found mostly in the Afrotropical region with some outlying species in Europe and Asia. The genus contains several species groups including canaries, seedeaters and the African siskins. The majority of species are small to medium sized birds with green and yellow, often streaky plumage though there are a few notable exceptions.
The treatment of the Canary group as a single genus has been subject to much debate, with behavioural and vocal characters being used to divide it into seven or more genera. Recent investigations using part of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene have suggested the genus consists of two main clades (Serinus sensu stricto and Crithagra) separated by certain members of the genus Carduelis, and these may be better treated as two separate genera. Species in the Crithagra clade could conceivably be split further into several more (sub)genera and may well be once relationships within the clade are better resolved. In the list below they are arranged in the groups as suggested in various publications e.g.(Elzen et al.) and (Ryan et al.).

CATEGORIES: Christianity in the United States, Evangelicalism in the United States, Christian fundamentalism, Charismatic and Pentecostal Christianity, Religion in the Southern United States

The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the south-eastern and south-central United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. The Bible Belt consists of much of the Southern United States. During the colonial period (1607–1776), the South was a stronghold of the Anglican church. Its transition to a stronghold of non-Anglican Protestantism occurred gradually over the next century as a series of religious revival movements, many associated with the Baptist denomination, gained great popularity in the region.
The region is usually contrasted with the mainline Protestantism and Catholicism of the northeastern United States, the religiously diverse Midwest and Great Lakes, the Mormon Corridor in Utah and southern Idaho, and the relatively secular western United States.  Whereas the state with the highest percentage of residents identifying as non-religious is the New England state of Vermont at 34%, in the Bible Belt state of Alabama it is just 6%.[tpl]cite web|title=American Religious Identification Survey|work = www.gc.cuny.edu|url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm#StateFaith[/tpl] Mississippi has the highest proportion of Baptists, at 55%. The earliest known usage of the term "Bible Belt" was by American journalist and social commentator H. L. Mencken, who in 1924 wrote in the Chicago Daily Tribune: "The old game, I suspect, is beginning to play out in the Bible Belt."Fred R. Shapiro (ed.). Yale Book of Quotations. Yale University Press (2006). ISBN 978-0-300-10798-2. Mencken claimed the term as his invention in 1927.H. L. Mencken letter to Charles Green Shaw, 1927 Dec. 2 .

Simulated reality is the hypothesis that reality could be simulated—for example by computer simulation—to a degree indistinguishable from "true" reality, and may in fact be such a simulation. It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation.
This is quite different from the current, technologically achievable concept of virtual reality. Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience. Simulated reality, by contrast, would be hard or impossible to separate from "true" reality.
There has been much debate over this topic, ranging from philosophical discourse to practical applications in computing.

[[Carduelis]]

The genus Carduelis[ref]
From Latin carduus, "thistle". Thistle seeds are a favorite food of many species.[/ref][tpl]cite journal|last=Arnaiz-Villena|first=Antonio|coauthors=Gomez-Prieto, Pablo; Ruiz-del-Valle, Valentín|title=El género Carduelis|journal=Ornitología Práctica|year=2010|volume=42 |url=http://chopo.pntic.mec.es/biolmol/publicaciones/CARDU-ORNI.PRACT.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] (in Spanish)
is a large group of birds in the finch family Fringillidae.  It includes the greenfinches, redpolls, goldfinches, linnets, the twite, and the non-African siskins. No species of this group ranges far into Africa (where they are replaced by the related genus Serinus), and the centers of evolution were probably Eurasia and North America, with a secondary radiation in the Neotropics.
The interrelationship of these species is complex and contentious. It is fairly certain[tpl]vague|date=March 2011[/tpl] that the crossbills are actually derived from proto-redpoll ancestors quite recently, and it was suggested that they should be placed in the same genus, for which the name Loxia would then have priority. On the other hand, the greenfinches (which are apparently the most distinct group) and the redpolls have themselves been separated in distinct genera which might be the best way to express both the actual evolutionary relationships and the evolutionarily significant distinctiveness of the crossbills. The molecular data indicates that the major lineages split in the Late Miocene (Tortonian, roughly 9-7 mya), but it is unable to suggest any one robust arrangement either of the major groups among each other, among the lineages of Carduelis sensu stricto, or indeed among two separate Serinus lineages (Ryan et al., 2004). As only the mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence has hitherto been studied (Arnaiz-Villena et al., 1998), more data is clearly necessary.
Here, the species of Carduelis sensu lato are listed according to current knowledge. The genus Carduelis sensu stricto could conceivably be split further, and in this case only the European Goldfinch and the Citril and Corsican Finch (newly placed in this genus) would remain in Carduelis.  The South American Classification of the AOU places South American siskins in the genus Sporagra based on research by Nguembock et al. (2009),[tpl]cite journal|last=Nguembock|first=B.

CSP was first described in a 1978 paper by C. A. R. Hoare, but has since evolved substantially. CSP has been practically applied in industry as a tool for specifying and verifying the concurrent aspects of a variety of different systems, such as the T9000 Transputer, as well as a secure ecommerce system. The theory of CSP itself is also still the subject of active research, including work to increase its range of practical applicability (e.g., increasing the scale of the systems that can be tractably analyzed).

[[Null cipher]]
CATEGORIES: Classical ciphers, Steganography

A null cipher is an ancient form of encryption where the plaintext is mixed with a large amount of non-cipher material. It would today be regarded as a simple form of steganography.  Null ciphers can also be used to hide ciphertext, as part of a more complex system.
In classical cryptography  a null is intended to confuse the cryptanalyst. Typically, a null will be a character which decrypts to obvious nonsense at the end of an otherwise intelligible phrase. In a null cipher, most of the characters may be nulls.
An example follows (Kipper 9):
Taking the first letter in each word successively yields the real message: "Newt is upset because he thinks he is President."
You can also choose to instead use the last letter of every word, or something like a pattern such as:
''Susan sAys GaIl Lies. MAtt leTs Susan fEel joVial. Elated (or) aNgry? ''
Using the pattern ( 1,2,3,1,2,3 letter in each word ) gives the message: "Sail at seven."

[[Combine harvester]]

CATEGORIES: Agricultural machinery, Combine harvesters

The combine harvester, or simply combine, is a machine that harvests grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate operations comprising harvesting—reaping, threshing, and winnowing—into a single process. Among the crops harvested with a combine are wheat, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), soybeans and flax (linseed). The waste straw left behind on the field is the remaining dried stems and leaves of the crop with limited nutrients which is either chopped and spread on the field or baled for feed and bedding for livestock.
Combine harvesters are one of the most economically important labor saving inventions, enabling a small fraction of the population to be engaged in agriculture.

Despite receiving lukewarm reviews and not being as commercially successful as the Lemonheads' previous two albums, It's a Shame About Ray and Come On Feel the Lemonheads, Car Button Cloth has gained a minor cult following in recent years. The tracks "It's All True," "If I Could Talk I'd Tell You" (cowritten by Eugene Kelly of the Vaselines), and "The Outdoor Type" were released as singles in the UK. "Purple Parallelogram," a song written by Dando and Oasis's Noel Gallagher, was originally included on promotional copies of Car Button Cloth between "Something's Missing" and "Knoxville Girl," but was reportedly removed at Gallagher's request.

The fourth HMS ''Ocean was a Canopus''-class battleship of the British Royal Navy. Commissioned in 1900, she entered service with the Mediterranean Fleet until January 1901, when she was transferred to the China Station. She was recalled from China in 1905 for service with the Channel Fleet after a period spent in reserve. From 1908 to early 1910, she was again assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. By now outclassed by the emergence of the dreadnoughts, she was assigned to the Home Fleet.
Assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron following the outbreak of World War I, Ocean was involved in operations around Ireland. She also escorted troop convoys from India and assisted in the defence of the Suez Canal. In 1915, she was involved in the Dardanelles Campaign. On 18 March, she attempted to retrieve HMS Irresistible, which had been badly damaged by a mine in Erenkui Bay, but had to abandon her salvage efforts due to heavy Turkish gunfire. She instead evacuated the surviving crew of Irresistible but struck a mine while making for the open sea. Badly damaged, her crew and the survivors of Irresistible were taken off by destroyers and Ocean left to sink in Morto Bay.

In mathematics, the uniform boundedness principle or Banach–Steinhaus theorem is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis. Together with the Hahn–Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field.  In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous  linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.
The theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn.

HMS ''Ocean was a Royal Navy Colossus''-class light fleet aircraft carrier of 13,190 tons built in Glasgow by Alexander Stephen and Sons.  Her keel was laid in November 1942, and she was commissioned on 30 June 1945.
In March 1944, a proposal was made by the Australian Government to purchase a light fleet carrier, specifically Ocean.[tpl]cite book |last=Wright |first=Anthony |title=Australian Carrier Decisions: the acquisition of HMA Ships Albatross, Sydney and Melbourne |origyear=1978 |edition= |series=Papers in Australian Maritime Affairs (No. 4) |date=June 1998 |publisher=Sea Power Centre |location=Canberra |isbn=0-642-29503-4 |id=[tpl]ISSN|1327-5658[/tpl] |pages=55–109[/tpl] The decision was rejected in early June 1945, and the carrier entered Royal Navy service.
On 4 December, 1945, a Sea Vampire flown by Eric "Winkle" Brown made the first  ever carrier landing of a purely jet-powered aircraft onto Ocean (although earlier that year a composite jet and piston engined Ryan FR-1 Fireball had made a carrier landing under jet power after its radial engine failed.)"First Jet Landing." Naval Aviation News, United States Navy, March 1946, p. 6. The first jet aircraft to operate from an aircraft carrier was the unconventional composite propeller-jet Ryan FR Fireball, but it was designed to utilize its piston engine during takeoff and landing. On 6 November 1945, the piston engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach and the pilot started the jet engine and landed, thereby performing the first jet-powered carrier landing, albeit unintentionally. The last Fairey Swordfish to make an official flight from a Royal Navy aircraft carrier did so earlier in October 1945 from the deck of Ocean. When British forces withdrew from Palestine in 1948, Ocean supported the withdrawal.  
Ocean twice deployed to Korea, firstly from May to October 1952 and then from May to November 1953. In August 1952 a formation of Hawker Sea Fury aircraft from the carrier engaged North Korean MiG-15 jets in air combat, shooting one down.

In August 1954 she joined the Home Fleet's Training Squadron but saw an active role in the Suez crisis. In the first ever large-scale helicopter borne assault, Westland Whirlwind and Bristol Sycamore helicopters from Ocean and HMS Theseus landed 425 men of 45 Commando and 23 tons of stores into Port Said in 90 minutes. After Suez, the ship did not see much more active service. She went into Extended Reserve in 1958 and was scrapped in 1962 at Faslane.

Although the new lineup was becoming more experimental with longer, improvised concert performances, the Yardbirds' record company brought in successful singles producer Mickie Most to coax out more commercial product. However, neither material that properly presented their new approach nor hit singles were forthcoming. Little Games became the Yardbirds' final studio album, although Most continued to produce singles for the group. These were later collected and released with the original album along with outtakes and alternate mixes on an expanded edition titled Little Games Sessions & More in 1992.

Gaius Terentilius Harsa, better known simply as Terentilius, was a plebeian tribune in Rome around 462 BC.
Terentilius agitated for a formal code of laws in the early days of the Roman Republic.  He took advantage of the fact that the consuls were away on a campaign against the Volsci to pressure the Roman Senate, controlled by patricians, for the code.
The patricians made a show of making peace with Terentilius, but in fact had no intention of codifying the laws at his request. The later Florentine writer Niccolò Machiavelli commented that this was similar to the Florentine 'Ten of War' that was eventually reinstated once the people realized it was the excessive abuse of authority that was despised, not the title or function of the office itself.Machiavelli, The Discourses, translated by Walker and Richardson, 209.
The story of Terentilius comes to us from one source, Book III of Livy's Ab Urbe Condita.

[[Crossbill]]
CATEGORIES: Loxia, Bird genera

The crossbill is a genus, Loxia, of birds in the finch family (Fringillidae), with three to five (or possibly many more) species. These birds are characterised by the mandibles with crossed tips, which gives the group its English name. Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.
Crossbills are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation which enables them to extract seeds from cones. These birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes, where their food sources grows. They erupt out of the breeding range when the cone crop fails. Crossbills breed very early in the year, often in winter months, to take advantage of maximum cone supplies.

The etymological root is Anglo-French lien, loyen "bond", "restraint", from Latin ligamen, from ligare "to bind".
In the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of encumbrances and would include other forms of mortgage or charge.  In the USA, a lien characteristically refers to non-possessory security interests (see generally: Security interest—categories).
In other common-law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest, being a passive right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged.  In contrast to the usage of the term in the USA, in other countries it refers to a purely possessory form of security interest; indeed, when possession of the property is lost, the lien is released.''Hatton v Car Maintenance' 1915 1 Ch 621  However, common-law countries also recognize a slightly anomalous form of security interest called an "equitable lien" which arises in certain rare instances.
Despite their differences in terminology and application, there are a number of similarities between liens in the USA and elsewhere in the common-law world.

[[Cynodont]]

CATEGORIES: Cynodonts

The cynodonts ("dog teeth"), in the clade Cynodontia, are therapsids that first appeared in the Late Permian (approximately 260 Ma). The group includes modern mammals as well as their extinct ancestors and close relatives. Nonmammalian cynodonts spread throughout southern Gondwana and are represented by fossils from South America, Africa, India, and Antarctica. In the northern continents, fossils have been found in eastern North America as well as in Belgium and northwestern France. Cynodontia is one of the most diverse groups of therapsids.

In human genetics, Y-chromosomal Adam (Y-MRCA) is a hypothetical name given to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) from whom all currently living people are descended patrilineally (tracing back only along the paternal or male lines of their family tree). However, the title is not permanently fixed on a single individual (see below).

Vera Mary Brittain (29 December 1893 – 29 March 1970) was a British writer, feminist and pacifist, best remembered as the author of  the best-selling 1933 memoir Testament of Youth, recounting her experiences during World War I and the beginning of her journey towards pacifism.

[[Testament of Youth]]

CATEGORIES: 1933 books, British autobiographies, History books about World War I, Masterpiece Theatre, Personal accounts of World War I, Anti-war books, Books adapted into films

Testament of Youth is the first instalment, covering 1900–1925, in the memoir of Vera Brittain (1893-1970). It  was published in 1933.  Brittain's memoir continues with Testament of Experience, published in 1957, and encompassing the years 1925–1950.  Between these two books comes Testament of Friendship (published in 1940), which is essentially a memoir of Brittain's close colleague and friend, Winifred Holtby. A final segment of memoir, to be called 'Testament of Faith' or 'Testament of Time' was planned by Brittain but remained unfinished at her death.
Testament of Youth has been acclaimed as a classic for its description of the impact of World War I on the lives of women and the middle-class civilian population of Great Britain. The book shows how the impact extended into the postwar years. It is also considered a classic in feminist literature for its depiction of a woman's pioneer struggle to forge an independent career in a society only grudgingly tolerant of educated women.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9228971/Veras-Testament-is-young-again.html |title=Vera’s Testament is young again |date=May 21, 2012 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |author=Mark Bostridge[/tpl]
In the foreword, Brittain describes how she originally intended to write of her experiences as a novel but was unable to achieve the objective distance from her subject necessary. She then tried to publish her original diary from the war years but with all names fictionalised. This too proved unworkable. Only then did she decide to write her own personal story, putting her own experiences in the wider historic and social context. Several critics have noted the cathartic process by which she deals with her grief in the writing.
The narrative begins with Vera's plans to enter the University of Oxford and her romance with Roland Leighton, a friend of her brother Edward.  Both were commissioned as officers early in World War I, and both were subsequently killed, as were several other members of their social circle.
The book's main subject is Vera's work as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse, nursing wounded in London, Malta and at Etaples in France.  It also describes how she returned, disillusioned, to Somerville College, Oxford after the war and completed her BA degree. It covers the beginning of her career in journalism, writing for Time and Tide and lecturing for the League of Nations. She visits the graves of her brother Edward in Italy and her fiancé Roland in France. Together with Winifred Holtby she toured the defeated and occupied regions of Germany and Austria in 1923.
It concludes with her meeting her husband George Catlin and their eventual marriage in 1925.
The diaries on which the book is partly based, Chronicle of Youth, edited by Alan Bishope, were published in 1981. In 1998, the war letters which Brittain also drew on in her autobiography were published in an edition by Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge. Entitled Letters from a Lost Generation, their appearance was met with considerable acclaim.

HMS ''Hermes'' was an aircraft carrier built for the Royal Navy. The ship was begun during World War I and finished after the war ended. She was the world's first ship to be designed and built as an aircraft carrier, although the Imperial Japanese Navy's [tpl]ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hōshō||2[/tpl] was the first to be commissioned.Milanovich, pp. 9, 13 The ship's construction was delayed by multiple changes in her design after she was laid down. After she was launched, her shipyard closed and her construction was suspended. Most of the changes were made to optimise her design in light of the results of experiments with the existing carriers.
Commissioned in 1924, Hermes served briefly with the Atlantic Fleet before spending the bulk of her career assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and the China Station. In the Mediterranean, she worked with other carriers developing multi-carrier tactics.  While showing the flag at the China Station, she helped to suppress pirates in Chinese waters. Hermes returned home in 1937 and was placed in reserve before becoming a training ship in 1938.
When World War II began in September 1939, the ship was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet and conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Western Approaches. She was transferred to Dakar in October to cooperate with the French Navy in hunting down German commerce raiders and blockade runners. Aside from a brief refit, Hermes remained there until Vichy France was established at the end of June 1940. Supported by several cruisers, the ship then blockaded Dakar and attempted to sink the [tpl]ship|French battleship|Richelieu[/tpl] by exploding depth charges underneath her stern, as well as sending Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers to attack her at night. While returning from this mission, Hermes rammed a British armed merchant cruiser in a storm and required several months of repairs in South Africa, then resumed patrolling for Axis shipping in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.
In February 1941, the ship supported Commonwealth forces in Italian Somaliland during the East African Campaign and did much the same two months later in the Persian Gulf during the Anglo-Iraqi War. After that campaign, Hermes spent most of the rest of the year patrolling the Indian Ocean. She refitted in South Africa between November 1941 and February 1942 and then joined the Eastern Fleet at Ceylon. After the raid on Colombo on 5 April by the Japanese, Hermes was sent to Trincomalee, but had left the harbour when the Japanese attacked it on 9 April. She was spotted near Batticaloa by a Japanese scout plane and attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. The carrier and her escorting destroyer were quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship although 307 men from Hermes were lost in the sinking.

Can't Stop is a board game designed by Sid Sackson originally published by Parker Brothers in 1980, and was long out of print in the United States. It was reprinted by Face 2 Face Games in 2007. An iOS version was developed by Playdek and released in 2012. The goal of the game is to "claim" (get to the top of) three of the columns before any of the other players can. But the more that the player risks rolling the dice during a turn, the greater the risk of losing the advances made during that turn.

The Schmalkaldic League ([tpl]lang-de|link=no|Schmalkaldischer Bund[/tpl] [tpl]lang-la|Foedus Smalcaldicum or Liga Smalcaldica[/tpl]) was a defensive alliance of Lutheran princes within the Holy Roman Empire during the mid-16th century.  Although originally started for religious motives soon after the start of the Protestant Reformation, its members eventually intended for the League to replace the Holy Roman Empire as their source of political allegiance.Merriman, p. 110. While it was not the first alliance of its kind, unlike previous formations, such as the League of Torgau, the Schmalkaldic League had a substantial military to defend its political and religious interests.  It received its name from the town of Schmalkalden, in the German province of Thuringia.

The word spork combines spoon and fork. Similarly, the word foon is a blend of fork and spoon. The word "spork" appeared in the 1909 supplement to the Century Dictionary, where it was described as a trade name and "a 'portmanteau-word' applied to a long, slender spoon having, at the end of the bowl, projections resembling the tines of a fork".

[[Graph isomorphism]]
CATEGORIES: Graph theory, Graph algorithms, Morphisms

In graph theory, an isomorphism of graphs G and H is a bijection between the vertex sets of G and H
such that any two vertices u and v of G are adjacent in G if and only if ƒ(u) and ƒ(v) are adjacent in H. This kind of bijection is commonly called "edge-preserving bijection", in accordance with the general notion of isomorphism being a structure-preserving bijection.
In the above definition, graphs are understood to be undirected non-labeled non-weighted graphs. However, the notion of isomorphism may be applied to all other variants of the notion of graph, by adding the requirements to preserve the corresponding additional elements of structure: arc directions, edge weights, etc., with the following exception. When spoken about graph labeling with unique labels, commonly taken from the integer range 1,...,n, where n is the number of the vertices of the graph, two labeled graphs are said to be isomorphic if the corresponding underlying unlabeled graphs are isomorphic.   
The graph isomorphism is an equivalence relation on graphs and as such it partitions the class of all graphs into equivalence classes. A set of graphs isomorphic to each other is called an isomorphism class of graphs.

A Public Lending Right (PLR) programme, is a programme intended to either compensate authors for the potential loss of sales from their works being available in public libraries, or as a governmental support of the arts, through support of works available in public libraries, such as books, music and artwork.
Twenty-eight countries have a PLR programme,"Public Lending Right (PLR) International Network website." and others are considering adopting one.  Canada, the United Kingdom, all the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand currently have PLR programmes.  There is ongoing debate in France about implementing one.  There is also a move towards having a Europe-wide PLR programme administered by the European Union.
The first PLR programme was initiated in Denmark in 1941. However, it was not properly implemented until 1946 due to World War II.[ref]
</ref> The idea spread slowly from country to country and many nations' PLR programs are quite recent developments.

[[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology]]
CATEGORIES: Java platform software, Knowledge representation, Ontology (information science), Open data, Knowledge bases

The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology or SUMO is an upper ontology intended as a foundation ontology for a variety of computer information processing systems. It was originally developed by the Teknowledge Corporation and now is maintained by Articulate Software. SUMO is open source.
SUMO originally concerned itself with meta-level concepts (general entities that do not belong to a specific problem domain), and thereby would lead naturally to a categorization scheme for encyclopedias.  It has now been considerably expanded to include a mid-level ontology and dozens of domain ontologies.
SUMO was first released in December 2000. It defines a hierarchy of SUMO classes and related rules and relationships. These are formulated in a version of the language SUO-KIF which has a LISP-like syntax. A mapping from WordNet synsets  to SUMO has also been defined.  
SUMO is organized for interoperability of automated reasoning engines. To maximize compatibility, schema designers can try to assure that their naming conventions use the same meanings as SUMO for identical words (for example, "agent" or "process").  SUMO has an associated open source Sigma knowledge engineering environment.

[[Picnic]]
CATEGORIES: Eating parties, Leisure

A picnic is a pleasure excursion at which a meal is eaten outdoors (al fresco or en plein air), ideally taking place in a beautiful landscape such as a park, beside a lake or with an interesting view and possibly at a public event such as before an open air theatre performance, and usually in summer. Descriptions of picnics show that the idea of a meal that was jointly contributed and was enjoyed out-of-doors were essential to a picnic from the early 19th century.Mary Ellen W. Hern, "Picnicking in the Northeastern United States, 1840-1900", Winterthur Portfolio 24.2/3 (Summer - Autumn 1989), pp. 139–152.
Picnics are often family-oriented but can also be an intimate occasion between two people or a large get-together such as company picnics and church picnics. It is also sometimes combined with a cookout, usually a form of barbecue; either grilling (griddling, gridironing, or charbroiling), braising (by combining a charbroil or gridiron grill with a broth-filled pot), baking, or a combination of all of the above.
On romantic and family picnics, a picnic basket and a blanket (to sit or recline on) are usually brought along. Outdoor games or some other form of entertainment are common at large picnics.  In established public parks, a picnic area generally includes picnic tables and possibly other items related to eating outdoors, such as built-in grills, water faucets, garbage containers, and restrooms.
Some picnics are a potluck, an entertainment at which each person contributed some dish to a common table for all to share. When the picnic is not also a cookout, the food eaten is rarely hot, instead taking the form of deli sandwiches, finger food, fresh fruit, salad, cold meats and accompanied by chilled wine or champagne or soft drinks.

[[Reciprocity law]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic number theory

In mathematics, a reciprocity law is a generalization of the law of quadratic reciprocity.
There are several different ways to express reciprocity laws. The early reciprocity laws found in the 19th century were usually expressed in terms of a power residue symbol (p/q) generalizing the quadratic reciprocity symbol,  that describes when a prime number is an nth power residue modulo another prime, and gave a relation between (p/q) and (q/p).  Hilbert reformulated the reciprocity laws as saying that a product over p of Hilbert norm residue symbols (a,b/p), taking values in roots of unity, is equal to 1. Artin reformulated the reciprocity laws  as a statement that the Artin symbol from ideals (or ideles) to elements of a Galois group is trivial on a certain subgroup. Several more recent generalizations express reciprocity laws using cohomology of groups or representations of adelic groups or algebraic K-groups, and their relationship with the original quadratic reciprocity law can be hard to see.

Saint Jean de Brébeuf (March 25, 1593 – March 16, 1649) was a French Jesuit missionary who traveled to New France (or Canada) in 1625. There he worked primarily with the Huron for the rest of his life, except for a short time back in France in 1629-1630. He learned their language and culture.
In 1649 Brébeuf and several other missionaries were captured when an Iroquois raid took over a Huron village. Together with Huron captives, the missionaries were ritually tortured and eight were killed, martyred on March 16, 1649. Brébeuf was beatified in 1925 and canonized as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church in 1930.

[[Systemic bias]]

CATEGORIES: Bias, Polling terms

Systemic bias is the inherent tendency of a process to support particular outcomes. The term generally refers to human systems such as institutions; the equivalent bias in non-human systems (such as measurement instruments or mathematical models used to estimate physical quantities) is often called systematic bias, and leads to systematic error in measurements or estimates. The issues of systemic bias are dealt with extensively in the field of industrial organization economics.

[[House arrest]]

CATEGORIES: Imprisonment and detention, Punishments

In justice and law, house arrest (also called home confinement, home detention, or electronic monitoring) is a measure by which a person is confined by the authorities to a certain residence. Travel is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is a lenient alternative to prison time or juvenile-detention time.
While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by authoritarian governments against political dissidents. In that case, typically, the person under house arrest does not have access to any means of communication. If electronic communication is allowed, conversations will most likely be monitored. With some electronic monitoring units, the conversations of prisoners can be directly monitored via the unit itself.

Amherst (2011 population 9,717; UA population 9,547) is a Canadian town in northwestern Cumberland County, Nova Scotia.
Located at the northeast end of the Cumberland Basin, an arm of the Bay of Fundy, Amherst is strategically situated on the eastern boundary of the Tantramar Marshes 3 kilometres east of the interprovincial border with New Brunswick and 65 kilometres east of the city of Moncton.  It is also located 60 kilometres southwest of the New Brunswick abutment of the Confederation Bridge to Prince Edward Island at Cape Jourimain.
Amherst is the shire town and largest population centre in Cumberland County.  According to Dr. Graham P. Hennessey, "The Micmac name was Nemcheboogwek meaning "going up rising ground", in reference to the higher land to the east of the Tantramar Marshes. The Acadians who settled here as early as 1672 called the village Les Planches. It was named Amherst by Colonel Joseph Morse, the first settler, in honour of Lord Amherst, the commander-in-chief of the British Army in North America during the Seven Years' War.

The Canadian Martyrs, also known as the North American Martyrs or the Martyrs of New France, were eight Jesuit missionaries from Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, who were tortured and martyred on various dates in the mid-17th century in Canada, in what are now southern Ontario and upstate New York, during the warfare between the Iroquois and the Huron.
The Martyrs are St. Jean de Brébeuf (1649),Jesuit Relations vol 35, IV St. Noël Chabanel (1649),Jesuit Relations vol 40, LXXXIII St. Antoine Daniel (1648),Jesuit Relations vol 33, LXVII St. Charles Garnier (1649), St. René Goupil (1642),Jesuit Relations: 28, "Account of René Goupil (donné)," by Father Isaac Jogues St. Isaac Jogues (1646),Jesuit Relations: 31, VIII St. Jean de Lalande (1646),Jesuit Relations vol 34, LXIV and St. Gabriel Lalemant (1649).
By the late 1640s the Jesuits appeared to have been making more progress in their mission to the Huron, and they claimed to have made many converts at this time.  Nevertheless, within Huron communities, the priests were not universally trusted.  Many Hurons considered them to be malevolent shamans who brought death and disease wherever they travelled.  Their arrival had coincided with epidemics after 1634 of smallpox and other infectious diseases, to which aboriginal peoples had no immunity.  (Epidemiological studies have shown the diseases were likely carried by the increased number of children immigrating after 1634 with families from cities in nations where smallpox was endemic, such as France, England and the Netherlands).  The Iroquois considered the Jesuits legitimate targets, as the missionaries were nominally allies of the Huron.

[[Bulldog bat]]
CATEGORIES: Noctilionidae

The bat family Noctilionidae, commonly known as bulldog bats or fisherman bats, is represented by two species, the greater and the lesser bulldog bats. They are found near water, from Mexico to Argentina and also in the Caribbean islands. The naked bulldog bat (Cheiromeles torquatus) does not belong to this family, but to the family Molossidae, the free-tailed bats.
The bulldog bats have orange to brown fur, and range in head-body length from 7 to 14 cm. They have relatively long legs, large feet exceptionally so in the case of the greater bulldog bat and strong claws.Their wings are long and narrow and their ears are large and funnel shaped. Unusual among bats, they have cheek-pouches for storing food. They also have full lips divided by a fold of skin giving a 'hare lip' look which together with the cheek pouches gives them their bulldog-like appearance. The species of lesser bulldog bats are insectivorous and whilst the greater bulldog bats also eat insects their chief food is fish.McDonald D. ed 2010 The Encyclopedia of Mammals Oxford University Press  ISBN 978-0-19-956799-7 p466 They use their echolocation to pinpoint the ripples they make on the surfaces of water.[tpl]cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 805|isbn= 0-87196-871-1[/tpl]
The greater bulldog bat trawls the water with its long, curved talons approximately 2–3 cm below the surface. It makes sweeps of between 30 cm and 3 m before ascending and turning to make a return sweep. In a single night, the bat may catch 20-30 small fish in this way.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press.

Westview Press Taiwan. ISBN 0-8133-4069-1. was the result of pro-democracy demonstrations that occurred in Kaohsiung, Taiwan on December 10, 1979.
The incident occurred when Formosa Magazine, headed by veteran opposition Legislative Yuan Legislator Huang Shin-chieh (黃信介), and other opposition politicians held a demonstration commemorating Human Rights Day in an effort to promote and demand democracy in Taiwan. At that time, the Republic of China was a one-party state and the government used this protest as an excuse to arrest the main leaders of the political opposition. 
The Kaohsiung Incident is well-recognized as a critical and important event in the post-war history of Taiwan and regarded as the watershed of the Taiwan democratization movements.[ref]Tang, Chih-Chieh (2007). Taiwanese Sociology, 13, 71-128. "勢不可免的衝突：從結構／過程的辯證看美麗島事件之發生"

[[Universal translator]]

CATEGORIES: Science fiction themes, Fictional technology, Star Trek devices

A universal translator is a device common to many science fiction works, especially on television. First described in Murray Leinster's 1945 novella "First Contact","Hic Rhodus, His Salta" by Robert Silverberg, Asimov's Science Fiction, January 2009, page 6. the translator's purpose is to offer an instant translation of any language. Technology companies are striving to develop a practical "universal" translator for common use.
As a convention, it is used to remove the problem of translating between alien languages, unless that problem is essential to the plot. To translate a new language in every episode when a new species or culture is encountered would consume time (especially when most of these shows have a half-hour or one-hour format) normally allotted for plot development and would potentially, across many episodes, become repetitive to the point of annoyance. Occasionally, alien races are able to extrapolate the rules of English from very little speech and then immediately be fluent in it, making the translator unnecessary.
While a universal translator seems unlikely, due to the apparent need for telepathy, scientists continue to work towards similar real-world technologies involving small numbers of known languages.[ref]

In some cases, jokes about stereotypically stupid people have circulated since the seventeenth century with only the wording and targeted groups changed.http://books.google.com/books?id=uk_WHTCTN9YC&pg=PA24

Augustus' great physical strength earned him the nicknames "the Strong", "the Saxon Hercules" and "Iron-Hand." He liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end.Sacheverell Sitwell. The Hunters and the Hunted, p. 60. Macmillan, 1947.
In order to be elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Augustus converted to Roman Catholicism. He owed allegiance to the Imperial Habsburgs as a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece.
As Elector of Saxony, he is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture. He established the Saxon capital of Dresden as a major cultural centre, attracting artists from across Europe to his court. Augustus also amassed an impressive art collection and built lavish baroque palaces in Dresden and Warsaw.
As King of Poland, his reign was not successful. He embroiled the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Great Northern War, which led to the Russian Empire strengthening its influence over the Commonwealth, and he failed to achieve internal reforms and to bolster royal power in the Commonwealth.

The greater bulldog bat or fisherman bat (Noctilio leporinus) is a type of fishing bat native to Latin America (Spanish: Murciélago pescador). The bat uses echolocation to detect water ripples made by the fish upon which it preys, then uses the pouch between its legs to scoop the fish up and its sharp claws to catch and cling to it. It is not to be confused with the lesser bulldog bat, which, though belonging to the same genus, merely catches water insects, such as water striders and water beetles.
It emits echolocation sounds through the mouth like Myotis daubentoni, but the sounds are quite different, containing a long constant frequency part around 55 kHz, which is an unusually high frequency for a bat this large.

The lesser bulldog bat (Noctilio albiventris) is an insectivorous and occasionally carnivorous bat of the (Neotropics), ranging through Central America and northern South America. 
These bats are reddish brown in color. They have a length of about three inches (7.5 cm), a forearm length of [tpl]convert|2+1/2|in|cm[/tpl], and weight of about one ounce (30 grams). The bats usually live near water or damp locations, residing in hollow trees or domestic dwellings. They attempt to capture by echolocation insects flying near the surface of water. The bats also have the ability to capture insects that fall onto the water surfaces. Occasionally, the larger bats catch and consume small fish (the most closely related species, the greater bulldog bat, is known for its fishing ability). 
They live about ten years and reach sexual maturity in one year.

Bath bricks were made by a number of companies in the town of Bridgwater, England, from fine clay dredged from the River Parrett near Dunball.[tpl]cite book |last=Hawkins |first=Desmond |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Avalon and Sedgemoor |year=1982 |publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing |location=Gloucester |isbn=0-86299-016-5 [/tpl] By the end of the 19th century some 24 million bath bricks had been produced in Bridgwater for the home and international markets.
The brick, similar in size to an ordinary house brick, could be used in a number of ways. A mild abrasive powder could be scraped from the brick and used as a scouring powder on floors and other surfaces. Powder could also be moistened with water for use on a cloth for polishing or as a kind of sand paper. Items such as knives might be polished directly on a wetted brick.

Barisal ([tpl]lang-bn|বরিশাল বিভাগ[/tpl]) is one of the seven administrative divisions of Bangladesh. Located in the south-central part of the country, it has an area of [tpl]convert|13,644.85|km2|abbr=on[/tpl], and a population of 8,147,000 at the 2011 Census (preliminary returns). It is bounded by Dhaka division on the north, the Bay of Bengal on the south, Chittagong division on the east and Khulna division on the west. The administrative capital, Barisal city, lies in the Ganges (Padma) River delta on an offshoot of the Arial Khan River (Kirtonkhola). Barisal division is criss-crossed by numerous rivers that earned her the nickname 'Dhan-Nodi-Kaal, Ei tine Barisal' (rice, river and canal built Barisal).

[[Transonic]]

CATEGORIES: Aerodynamics, Airspeed

In aeronautics, transonic refers to the condition of flight in which a range of velocities of airflow exist surrounding and flowing past an air vehicle or an aerofoil that are concurrently below, at, and above the speed of sound in the range of Mach 0.8 to 1.0, i.e. 600–768 mph (965–1236 km/h). This condition depends not only on the travel speed of the craft, but also on the temperature of the airflow in the vehicle's local environment. It is formally defined as the range of speeds between the critical Mach number, when some parts of the airflow over an air vehicle or airfoil are supersonic, and a higher speed, typically near Mach 1.2, when the vast majority of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds some of the airflow is supersonic, but a significant fraction is not.
Most modern jet powered aircraft are engineered to operate at transonic air speeds.  Transonic airspeeds see a rapid increase of drag from about Mach 0.8, and it is the fuel costs of the drag that typically limits the airspeed. Attempts to reduce wave drag can be seen on all high-speed aircraft; most notable is the use of swept wings, but another common form is a wasp-waist fuselage as a side effect of the Whitcomb area rule.
Severe instability can occur at transonic speeds. Shock waves move through the air at the speed of sound. When an object such as an aircraft also moves at the speed of sound, these shock waves build up in front of it to form a single, very large shock wave. During transonic flight, the plane must pass through this large shock wave, as well as contend with the instability caused by air moving faster than sound over parts of the wing and slower in other parts.
Transonic speeds can also occur at the tips of rotor blades of helicopters and aircraft. However, as this puts severe, unequal stresses on the rotor blade, it is avoided and may lead to dangerous accidents if it occurs. It is one of the limiting factors to the size of rotors, and also to the forward speeds of helicopters (as this speed is added to the forward-sweeping (leading) side of the rotor, thus possibly causing localized transonics).

Círdan (pronounced [tpl]IPA-art|ˈkiːrdan|[/tpl]) ('ship-maker' in Sindarin) the Shipwright is a fictional character created by J. R. R. Tolkien. He was a Telerin Elf, a great mariner and shipwright, and lord of the Falas during much of the First Age. He was the bearer of the Great Ring Narya, which he in turn gave to Gandalf. 
He had a beard, which was rare for Elves, and was of great age at the time of the War of the Ring. He was first mentioned around the time of Melkor's imprisonment at the beginning of the First Age. Círdan had grey or silver hair in the Third Age of Middle-earth, like his overlord and kinsman Thingol. 
His 'true' name, according to the tradition among the Sindar of Doriath, was Nōwē ([tpl]IPA-art|ˈnɔːwɛː|[/tpl]) in the form it had in the original tongue of the Elves. It was never used after his settlement in Beleriand and thus has no Sindarin or Quenya form.

[[Hithlum]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth realms

In J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, Hithlum ([tpl]IPA-art|ˈhiθlum[/tpl], archaically [tpl]IPA-art|ˈxiθlum[/tpl]) is the region north of Beleriand near the Helcaraxë.
Hithlum was separated from Beleriand proper by the Ered Wethrin mountain chain, and was named after the sea mists which formed there at times: Hithlum is Sindarin for "Mist-shadow"; its Quenya counterpart is Hísilómë ([tpl]IPA-art|ˌhiːsiˈloːmɛ[/tpl], archaically [tpl]IPA-art|ˌxiːθiˈloːmɛ[/tpl]).
Hithlum was subdivided in Mithrim, where the High Kings of the Noldor had their halls, and Dor-lómin, which later became a fief of the House of Hador.
The Ered Wethrin ("Mountains of Shadow") formed the southern and eastern wall, and had only a few passes; as such they formed a natural defensive line. The western wall was formed by the Ered Lómin or "Echoing Mountains", which curved north-westward to Helcaraxë.
The land of Lammoth lay west of the Ered Lómin and was not part of Beleriand or Hithlum. The land of Nevrast was separated from Hithlum by the southern part of the Ered Lómin range. Nevrast was usually seen as part of Hithlum, but its climate was that of Beleriand.
Hithlum was cold and rainy, but quite fertile. The Noldor landed here in the Firth of Drengist and first camped at the shores of Lake Mithrim.
Later in the First Age, Hithlum was continually under attack by Morgoth, finally being lost after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. The Hadorians were scattered, killed, or enslaved, the Noldor were enslaved in Morgoth's mines if they could not flee in time, and Morgoth trapped the Easterlings there.
Hithlum was completely destroyed during the War of Wrath.

[[Music of Egypt]]

CATEGORIES: Egyptian music

The music of Egypt has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity. The ancient Egyptians credited one of the powerfull gods Hathor with the invention of music, which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilize the world. The earliest material and representational evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the Predynastic period, but the evidence is more securely attested in the Old Kingdom when harps, flutes and double clarinets were played.Music of Ancient Egypt, Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan. Percussion instruments, lyres and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Cymbalsimage frequently accompanied music and dance, much as they still do in Egypt today. Egyptian folk music, including the traditional Sufi dhikr rituals, are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient Egyptian music, having preserved many of its features, rhythms and instruments.Hickmann, Hans. "Un Zikr Dans le Mastaba de Debhen, Guîzah (IVème Dynastie)." Journal of the International Folk Music Council. Vol. 9. (1957), pp. 59-62.__. "Rythme, mètre et mesure de la musique instrumentale et vocale des anciens Egyptiens." Acta Musicologica, Vol. 32, Fasc. 1. (Jan. - Mar., 1960), pp. 11-22.
They also played recorders and clarinets.
In general, Arabic music is the term used to identify the present music of Egypt. The tonal structure of Arabic music is defined by the maqamat, loosely similar to Western modes, while the rhythm of Arabic music is governed by the awzan (wazn, sing.), formed by combinations of accented and unaccented beats and rests. Typically ancient Egyptian music is composed from the phrygian dominant scale, phrygian scale, Double harmonic scale (Arabic scale) or lydian scale. The phrygian dominant scale may often feature an altered note or two in parts to create tension. For instance the music could typically be in the key of E phrygian dominant using the notes E, F, G sharp, A, B, C, D and then have an A sharp, B, A sharp, G natural and E to create tension.
thumb|200px|Front and rear views of the oud.Since the Nasser era, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, particularly among the large youth population of Egypt. Egyptian folk music continues to be played during weddings and other traditional festivities. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Egyptian music was a way to communicate social and class issues. Among some of the most popular Egyptian pop singers today are Mohamed Mounir and Amr Diab.
Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of luminaries such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz and Mahmud Osman, who were all patronized by Khedive Ismail, and who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish, Umm Kulthum, Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Abdel Halim Hafez, Zakariyya Ahmad and other Egyptian musicians.
Egyptian music began its recorded history in the 1910s, around the time composers such as Sayed Darwish were incorporating western musical forms into their work. Some of the Middle East's biggest musical stars have been Egyptian. Abdel Halim Hafez and Umm Kulthum were especially popular. Most of these stars, including Umm Kulthum, were part of the classical Egyptian and Arabic music tradition. Some, like Abd el-Halim Hafez, were associated with the Egyptian nationalist movement in 1952.

It also includes those music produced by people of Chinese origin outside of mainland China using traditional Chinese instruments or in the Chinese language.
Different types of music have been recorded in historical Chinese documents from the early periods of Chinese civilization which, together with archaeological artifacts discovered, provided evidence of a well-developed musical culture as early as the Zhou Dynasty (1122 BC – 256 BC). These further developed into various forms of music through succeeding dynasties, producing the rich heritage of music that is part of the Chinese cultural landscape today. Chinese music however continues to evolve in the modern times. and more contemporary forms have also emerged.

thumb|right|200px|Impressively carved mushrooms are the centerpiece of White Desert national park, EgyptVentifacts can be abraded to eye-catching natural sculptures such as the main features of White Desert protectorate near Farafra oasis. In moderately tall, isolated rock outcrops, mushroom shaped pillars of rock may form as the outcrop is eroded by saltating sand grains. This occurs because, even in strong winds, sand grains can't be continuously held in the air. Instead, the particles bounce along the ground, rarely reaching higher than a few feet above the earth. Over time, the bouncing sand grains can erode the lower portions of a ventifact, while leaving a larger less eroded cap. The results can be fantastic stone mushrooms.
Individual stones, such as those forming desert pavement, are often found with grooved, etched, or polished surfaces where these same wind driven processes have slowly worn away the rock.
When ancient ventifacts are preserved without being moved or disturbed, they may serve as a paleo-wind indicators. The wind direction at the time the ventifact formed will be parallel to grooves or striations cut in the rock.  
An example of a Martian ventifact was named Jake Matijevic. By analyzing its shape, it was possible to reconstruct the main wind direction which sculpted the rock.Patrick Zasada (2013) Entstehung des Mars-Gesteins "Jake Matijevic". Sternzeit, issue 2/2013: Page 98-101. (German language).

In total there are 79 commissioned ships in the navy. 19 of the commissioned vessels are major surface combatants (6 guided missile destroyers and 13 frigates) and 11 are nuclear-powered submarines (4 ballistic missile submarines and 7 fleet submarines). In addition the Navy possesses an aircraft carrier (though without fixed-wing aircraft), an amphibious assault ship, two amphibious transport docks, 15 mine countermeasures vessels, 24 patrol vessels, 4 survey vessels and two historic warships (Victory and Bristol). The total displacement of the Royal Navy is approximately 362,000 tonnes (or 797,000 tonnes including the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and Royal Marines).
Besides the Royal Navy, the Naval Service also includes the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and the Royal Marines. Both of these constituent parts of the Naval Service operate their own fleets of naval vessels which contribute to the available seagoing assets of the Royal Navy, however they are not included in this list or the above figures. In addition, naval training vessels can be found based at various Royal Navy shore establishments.
Although not a formal part of the Naval Service, 'Marine Services' provided by the joint venture under Serco Denholm operates a range of auxiliary ships (coastal logistics, tugs, research vessels, etc.) in support of the Royal Navy for both port and deep water operations. In 2008 there were approximately 110 vessels in operation.Serco Denholm - MoD contract maritimejournal.com Serco Denholm took over Marine Services to the Royal Navy from the former Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service in 2008 under a PFI contract with the Ministry of Defence.Serco Marine Services
All ships and submarines currently in commission with the Royal Navy were built in the United Kingdom, with the exception of Endurance and Protector which were built in Norway. All vessels of the Royal Navy bear the ship prefix "HMS" - Her (or His) Majesty's Ship - with the exception of Gleaner which bears the prefix "HMSML" - Her (or His) Majesty's Survey Motor Launch.

Sir William Catesby (1450Entry in War of the Roses website; see also John A. Wagner, Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses, (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2001), 49-50. – August 25, 1485) was one of Richard III of England's principal councillors. He also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Speaker of the House of Commons during Richard's reign.
The son of Sir William Catesby of Ashby St Ledgers, Northamptonshire (died 1478) and Philippa, daughter and heiress of Sir William Bishopston, he was trained for the law in the Inner Temple.Dictionary of National Biography, 63 vols., (New York: Macmillian, 1887) 9:284 sub loco As an aspiring lawyer Catesby initially progressed in the service of William, 1st Lord Hastings. He married Margaret, daughter of William La Zouche, 6th Baron Zouche of Harringworth; the couple had three sons. Upon the death of his father he inherited a large number of estates in the English Midlands and was land-agent for many others. He was a member of the Council that ruled during the reign of Edward V. After Richard was enthroned, Catesby was one of King Richard's closest advisors. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as Speaker of the English House of Commons during the Parliament of 1484, in which he sat as knight of the shire for Northamptonshire. He also received a substantial grant of land from the king, enough to make him richer than most knights.Ross, p. 156.
In July 1484, William Collingbourne, a Tudor agent, tacked up a lampooning poem to St. Paul's Cathedral, which mentions Catesby among the three aides to King Richard, whose emblem was a white boar:

Collingbourne was hanged, drawn and quartered for this and other alleged treasonable activities. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
William Catesby was one of the two councillors (the other was Richard Ratcliffe) who are reputed to have told the king that marrying Elizabeth of York would cause rebellions in the north.Weir The Princes in the Tower p. 211-212. He fought alongside Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field and was captured. Alone of those of importance he was executed three days later at Leicester. The suggestion that he might have made a deal with the Stanleys before the battle comes from his will when he asked them "to pray for my soul as ye have not for my body, as I trusted in you."Gairdner, p. 284
After his death his estates were largely confiscated by Henry VII. Catesby was succeeded by his eldest son, George, to whom the family seat of Ashby St Legers was later restored. Robert Catesby, leader of the Gunpowder Plot, was a descendant. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

The music of Slovakia has been influenced both by the county's native Slovak peoples and the music of neighbouring regions. Whilst there are traces of pre-historic musical instruments, the country has a rich heritage of folk music and mediaeval liturgical music, and from the 18th century onwards, in particular, musical life was influenced by that of Austria-Hungary. In the 19th century, composers such as Jan Levoslav Bella began to write romantic music with a Slovak character. In the twentieth century, there were a number of composers who identified with Slovak culture. After the fall of communism in 1989–90 the country also began to develop its own popular music scene in Western style.

[[Music of the Central African Republic]]

CATEGORIES: Central African music

The music of the Central African Republic includes many different forms.  Western rock and pop music, as well as Afrobeat, soukous and other genres have become popular nation-wide.  The sanza is a popular instrument.
The Pygmies have a complex folk music tradition.  Polyphony and counterpoint are common components, as is a varied rhythmic structure.  The trumpet-based music of the Bandas has also gained some popularity outside of the area due to its jazzy structure.  The Ngbaka use an unusual instrument called a mbela, which is made with an arched branch and a string strung between the two ends and held in front of the musician's mouth.  When the string is struck, the mouth is used to amplify and modulate the tone.  Instruments similar to the mbela are sometimes considered the oldest ancestors of all string instruments http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/africa/central_african_republic/printable.htm.
The national anthem of the Central African Republic is "La Renaissance".  This song, which has been the anthem since 1960, was written by Barthélémy Boganda (words), the first President of the Central African Republic, and Herbert Pepper, who also composed the melody for the Senegalese national anthem http://www.nationalanthems.info/cf.htm.

Grading in education is the process of applying standardized measurements of varying levels of achievement in a course.
Grades can be assigned in letters, as a range (for example 1 to 6), as a percentage of a total number correct, or as a number out of a possible total (for example out of 20 or 100).
In some countries, all grades from all current classes are averaged to create a grade point average (GPA) for the marking period.  The GPA is calculated by taking the number of grade points a student earned in a given period of time of middle school through high school.grade point average. (n.d.).

[[Midnight]]

CATEGORIES: Parts of a day, Night

Midnight is  the transition time period from one day to the next: the moment when the date changes. In ancient Roman timekeeping, midnight was halfway between sunset and sunrise, varying according to the seasons.
Solar midnight is that time opposite of solar noon, when the sun is closest to nadir and the night is equidistant from dusk and dawn. Due to the advent of time zones, which make time identical across a range of meridians, and daylight saving time, it rarely coincides with midnight on a clock.  Solar midnight is dependent on longitude and time of the year rather than on a time zone.
In the northern hemisphere, "midnight" had an ancient geographic association with "north" (as did "noon" with "south" – see noon). Modern Polish and Ukrainian preserve this association with their words for "midnight" ("północ", "північ" – literally "half-night"), which also means "north".

[[Cylon of Athens]]
CATEGORIES: 632 BC deaths, Ancient Athenians, Ancient Olympic competitors, 7th-century BC Greek people, Government of ancient Athens, Archaic Athens, Year of birth unknown

Cylon (or Kylon; Greek: Κύλων) was an Athenian associated with the first reliably dated event in Athenian history, the Cylonian affair.
Cylon, one of the Athenian nobles and a previous victor of the Olympic Games, attempted a coup in 632 BC with support from Megara, where his father-in-law, Theagenes was tyrant. The oracle at Delphi had advised him to seize Athens during a festival of Zeus, which Cylon understood to mean the Olympics. However, the coup was opposed, and Cylon and his supporters took refuge in Athena's temple on the Acropolis. Cylon and his brother escaped, but his followers were cornered by Athens's nine archons.  According to Plutarch and Thucydides (1.126), they were persuaded by the archons to leave the temple and stand trial after being assured that their lives would be spared.  
In an effort to ensure their safety, the accused tied a rope to the temple's statue and went to the trial.  On the way, the rope (again, according to Plutarch) broke of its own accord. The Athenian archons, led by Megacles, took this as the goddess's repudiation of her suppliants and proceeded to stone them to death (on the other hand, Herodotus, 5.71, and Thucydides, 1.126, do not mention this aspect of the story, stating that Cylon's followers were simply killed after being convinced that they would not be harmed). Most likely, the story found in Plutarch is a later invention.
Megacles and his genos, the Alcmaeonidae, were exiled from the city for violating the laws against killing suppliants.  The Alcmaeonidae were cursed with a miasma ("stain" or "pollution"), which was inherited by later generations, even after the genos retook control of Athens.

The American Record Company was a United States record label, in business from about 1904 to 1908. Then re-activated in 1979.
The American Record Company was founded by Ellsworth A. Hawthorne and Horace Sheble (formerly dealers for Edison Records who had been blacklisted for their questionable business methods) and Frederick M. Prescott. It was based in Springfield, Massachusetts. They produced single-sided lateral-cut-groove disc records. 
The principals were connected with the Odeon Records firm (some export pressings carried the "American Odeon Record" name). Most of the records are single sided, but there are also two-sided records known on the label; one researcher stated that the company would press any two sides paired, if the buyer met the minimum-order qualification. As well, these records are notable for being blue in color, rather than the usual black. Several variations of the "Indian" label exist, differing only in minor details. The records appear to have been numbered using a sequence which began at (or near) 030000; the numbers had reached the mid 031000's by the end of operation. The records exist in 7-inch, 10-inch and 10.75-inch sizes, with the latter size being derived from its connection with Odeon (which also used that size). The seven-inch discs used a different numbering sequence, and seemed to have only been produced for a short time. The double-faced issues used the numbers of each side when issued.
The company was closed after unfavorable judgments on patents which the American Record Company had violated from Emile Berliner, Columbia Records, and the Victor Talking Machine Company.
The label of the discs featured artwork depicting a Native American with a smoking pipe listening to a front-mount disc phonograph of undeterminable manufacture.
In February 1979 Maurice White of the R&B group Earth, Wind and Fire re-launched the American Recording Company (ARC), a Columbia Records distributed label whose artist roster included Deniece Williams and the Emotions.

[[Pre-flashing]]

CATEGORIES: Photographic techniques

In cinematography and photography, pre-flashing is the exposure of the film or other photosensor to uniform light prior to exposing it to the scene to be imaged. This adds a bias to the overall light input recorded by the sensor.  
It is sometimes used for artistic effects, as it can be used to add a colour cast to shadows without significantly affecting highlights.
It is also used in fields such as astronomy to bias CCD image sensors into a linear region, improving their low-light sensitivity.

The Boat Race is an annual rowing race between the Oxford University Boat Club and the Cambridge University Boat Club, rowed between competing eights on the River Thames in London, United Kingdom. It is also known as the University Boat Race and the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, or by a title that includes the name of its current sponsor (from 2013, the BNY Mellon Boat Race). It usually takes place on the last weekend of March or the first weekend of April.
The first race was in 1829 and the event has been held annually since 1856, except during the First and Second World Wars. The course covers a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) stretch of the Thames in West London, from Putney to Mortlake. Members of both teams are traditionally known as blues and each boat as a "Blue Boat", with Cambridge in light blue and Oxford dark blue. As of 2014 Cambridge have won the race 81 times and Oxford 78 times, with one dead heat.
The race is a well-established and popular fixture in the British sporting calendar. Upwards of 250,000 people watch the race live from the banks of the river each year (in 2009, a record 270,000 people watched the race live[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23821000-record-crowd-for-easter-boat-race.do | title = Record crowd for Easter Boat Race[/tpl]) while a further 15 million or more watch it on television."University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide".

[[Corona del Mar, Newport Beach]]
CATEGORIES: Populated coastal places in California, Neighborhoods in Newport Beach, California

Corona del Mar or CdM (Spanish for "Crown of the Sea") is a town in the affluent city of Newport Beach, California.  It generally consists of all land on the seaward face of the San Joaquin Hills south of Avocado Avenue to the city limits, as well as the development of Irvine Terrace, just north of Avocado. Corona del Mar is known for its fine beaches, tidepools, cliffside views and quaint village shops.  Beaches in the area include Corona del Mar State Beach as well as Crystal Cove State Park south of Corona del Mar,  accessible by paths winding down a steep hillside.
Settled early in the 20th century, the older area of Corona del Mar consists mostly of closely spaced, free-standing, detached single-family houses of varying architecture, concentrated along Pacific Coast Highway (also known as "PCH" or State Route 1).  Newer developments in Harbor View Hills consist of California ranch style houses, many with expansive ocean views.
Corona del Mar has no locally administered municipal government, but receives all municipal level services from the City of Newport Beach, and has a representative to the Newport Beach City Council. It is unusual in that although it is a part of the incorporated city of Newport Beach, the post office accepts a mailing address of Corona del Mar for those residents living in the 92625 ZIP Code. Corona del Mar also has its own Chamber of Commerce.

Gloria al Bravo Pueblo (Glory to the Brave People) was adopted as Venezuela's national anthem by President Antonio Guzmán Blanco on May 25, 1881. The lyrics were written by the physician and journalist Vicente Salias in 1810. The music was later composed by musician Juan José Landaeta. It is said, however, that the melody has been known since 1840 as La Marsellesa Venezolana (Venezuelan Marseillaise), in reference to its subtle similarity to the French national anthem.
Some recent investigations have suggested that the real author of the anthem was Andrés Bello, and not Salias, to whom it was originally credited, and the music was composed by another musician called Lino Gallardo.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] However, this theory has yet to be proven, and lacks any real recognition among the general Venezuelan population, historians, or otherwise.

[[Macrocosm and microcosm]]

CATEGORIES: Classical Greek philosophy, Natural philosophy, Esoteric cosmology, Shabda

Macrocosm and microcosm  is an ancient Greek Neo-Platonic schema of seeing the same patterns reproduced in all levels of the cosmos,  from the largest scale (macrocosm or universe-level) all the way down to the smallest scale (microcosm or sub-sub-atomic or even metaphysical-level). In the system the midpoint is Man, who summarizes the cosmos.
Macrocosm/microcosm is a  Greek compound of μακρο- "Macro-" and  μικρο- "Micro-", which are Greek respectively for "large" and "small", and the word κόσμος kósmos which means "order" as well as "world" or "ordered world."
Today, the concept of microcosm has been dominated by sociology to mean a small group of individuals whose behavior is typical of a larger social body encompassing it. A microcosm can be seen as a special kind of epitome. Conversely, a macrocosm is a social body made of smaller compounds.

Johanna Maria Lind (6 October 1820[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]2 November 1887), better known as Jenny Lind, was a Swedish opera singer, often known as the "Swedish Nightingale".  One of the most highly regarded singers of the 19th century, she performed in soprano roles in opera in Sweden and across Europe, and undertook an extraordinarily popular concert tour of America beginning in 1850. She was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music from 1840.
Lind became famous after her performance in Der Freischütz in Sweden in 1838.  Within a few years, she had suffered vocal damage, but the singing teacher Manuel García saved her voice.  She was in great demand in opera roles throughout Sweden and northern Europe during the 1840s, becoming the protégée of Felix Mendelssohn. After two acclaimed seasons in London, she announced her retirement from opera at the age of 29.
In 1850, Lind went to America at the invitation of the showman P. T. Barnum. She gave 93 large-scale concerts for him and then continued to tour under her own management. She earned more than $350,000 from these concerts, donating the proceeds to charities, principally the endowment of free schools in Sweden. With her new husband, Otto Goldschmidt, she returned to Europe in 1852 where she had three children and gave occasional concerts over the next two decades, settling in England in 1855.  From 1882, for some years, she was a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music in London.

During the Battle of Fraustadt on  February 3, August II was only 120 kilometers away with a cavalry force about 8,000 men strong. This was one of the main reasons Swedish General Rehnskiöld hurried to engage Schulenburg.

[[Willow Tit]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of Europe, Poecile, Animals described in 1827, Birds of Ukraine

The  Willow Tit (Poecile montanus) is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and northern Asia. It is more of a conifer specialist than the closely related Marsh Tit, which explains it breeding much further north. It is resident, and most birds do not migrate.
In the east of its range it is much paler than Marsh Tit, but as one goes west the various races become increasingly similar, so much so that it was not recognised as a breeding bird in Great Britain until the end of the 19th century, despite being widespread.
The Willow Tit is distinguished from the Marsh Tit by a sooty brown instead of a glossy blue black cap; the general colour is otherwise similar, though the under parts are more buff and the flanks distinctly more rufous; the pale buff edgings to the secondaries form a light patch on the closed wing. The feathers of the crown and the black bib under the bill are longer, but this is not an easily noticed character. However, the more graduated tail (not square) shows distinctly when spread. Length is 11.5 cm, and wings range from 60–70 mm.
The commonest call is a nasal zee, zee, zee, but the notes of the bird evidently vary considerably. Occasionally a double note, ipsee, ipsee, is repeated four or five times.
The Willow Tit often excavates its own nesting hole, even piercing hard bark; this is usually in a rotten stump or in a tree, more or less decayed. Most nests examined are cups of felted material, such as fur, hair and wood chips, but feathers are sometimes used. The number of eggs varies from six to nine, with reddish spots or blotches..
Birds feed on insects, caterpillars, and seeds, much like other tits. This species is parasitised by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae.[tpl]cite book |title= Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos.

CATEGORIES: Mikoyan aircraft, Soviet fighter aircraft 1960–1969, Soviet military reconnaissance aircraft 1960–1969, 1970 introductions

The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 ([tpl]lang-ru|Микоян и Гуревич МиГ-25[/tpl]) (NATO reporting name: Foxbat) is a supersonic interceptor and reconnaissance aircraft that was among the fastest military aircraft to enter service. It was designed by the Soviet Union's Mikoyan-Gurevich bureau. The first prototype flew in 1964, and the aircraft entered into service in 1970. It has a top speed of Mach 2.83 (as high as Mach 3.2, but at risk of significant damage to the engines), and features a powerful radar and four air-to-air missiles.
When first seen in reconnaissance photography, the large wing planform suggested an enormous and highly maneuverable fighter, at a time when U.S. design theories were also evolving towards higher maneuverability due to combat performance in the Vietnam War. The appearance of the MiG-25 sparked serious concern in the West and prompted dramatic increases in performance for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle then under development in late 1960s. The capabilities of the MiG-25 were better understood in 1976 when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected in a MiG-25 to the United States via Japan. It turned out that the weight of the aircraft necessitated large wings.
Production of the MiG-25 series ended in 1984 after completion of 1,190 aircraft. A symbol of the Cold War, the MiG-25 flew with Soviet allies and former Soviet republics, remaining in limited service in Russia and several other nations. It is the second fastest and second highest-flying military aircraft ever fielded after the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft."Global Aircraft – Top 50 Fastest Aircraft."

Ethan of Athos is an English language science fiction novel that is part of the Vorkosigan Saga by American author Lois McMaster Bujold. It is an unusual item in the series in that it does not feature Miles Vorkosigan, the protagonist of almost all the other books. It appears in the 2001 omnibus Miles, Mystery and Mayhem.
The name "Athos" for the main character's planet may be a reference to Mount Athos in Greece. Alternatively, it may be an indirect tribute to the actor Oliver Reed, whom Bujold is known to admire (she has cited him as a model for Miles' father Aral Vorkosigan); Reed played the role of Athos in the 1973 film version of The Three Musketeers.

The bird is easily recognisable by its blue and yellow plumage, but various authorities dispute their scientific classification.
Eurasian Blue Tits, usually resident and non-migratory birds, are widespread and a common resident breeder throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and western Asia in deciduous or mixed woodlands with a high proportion of oak. They usually nest in tree holes, although they easily adapt to nest boxes where necessary. Their main rival for nests and in the search for food is the much larger Great Tit.
The Eurasian Blue Tit prefers insects and spiders for their diet. Outside the breeding season, they also eat seeds and other vegetable-based foods. The birds are famed for their skill, as they can cling to the outermost branches and hang upside down when looking for food.

The European Crested Tit, or simply Crested Tit (Lophophanes cristatus) (formerly Parus cristatus), is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common resident breeder in coniferous forests throughout central and northern Europe and in deciduous woodland in France and the Iberian peninsula. In Great Britain, it is chiefly restricted to the ancient pinewoods of Inverness and Strathspey in Scotland, and seldom strays far from its haunts. A few vagrant Crested Tits have been seen in England. It is resident, and most individuals do not migrate.

[[Adele ring]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic number theory, Topological algebra

In algebraic number theory and topological algebra, the adele ringAlso spelled: adèle ring [tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|_|r|ɪ|ŋ[/tpl]. (other names are the adelic ring, the ring of adeles) is a self-dual topological ring built on the field of rational numbers (or, more generally, any algebraic number field). It involves in a symmetric way all the completions of the field.
The adele ring was invented by Claude Chevalley for the purposes of simplifying and clarifying class field theory. It has also found applications outside that area. 
The adele ring and its relation to the number field are among  the most fundamental objects in number theory. The quotient of its multiplicative group by the multiplicative group of the algebraic number field is the central object in class field theory. It is a central principle of Diophantine geometry to study solutions of polynomials equations in number fields by looking at their solutions in the larger complete adele ring, where it is generally easier to detect solutions, and then deciding which of them come from the number field. 
The word "adele" is short for "additive idele"Neukirch (1999) p. 357. and it was invented by André Weil.  The previous name was the valuation vectors. The ring of adeles was historically preceded by the ring of repartitions, a construction which avoids completions, and is today sometimes referred to as pre-adele.

Lactobacillus delbrueckii'' subsp. ''bulgaricus (until 1984 known as Lactobacillus bulgaricus) is one of several bacteria used for the production of yogurt. It is also found in other naturally fermented products.  First identified in 1905 by the Bulgarian doctor Stamen Grigorov, the bacterium feeds on lactose to produce lactic acid, which is used to preserve milk.
It is a gram-positive rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is non-motile and does not form spores. It is regarded as aciduric or acidophilic, since it requires a low pH (around 5.4–4.6) to grow effectively. The bacterium has complex nutritional requirements.

[[Given name]]

CATEGORIES: Given names

A person's given name, or in Western contexts a first name, forename or Christian name, is a part of his or her personal name and identifies and differentiates the person between members of a group, especially in a family, all of whose members usually share the same family name (surname). A given name is purposefully given, usually by a child's parents at or near birth, in contrast to an inherited one such as a family name."A name given to a person at birth or at baptism, as distinguished from a surname" – according to the American Heritage Dictionary A given name is sometimes legally changed through a name change.
Given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner in informal situations. In more formal situations the surname is more commonly used, unless it is necessary to distinguish between people with the same surname. The idiom "on a first-name basis" (or "on first-name terms") alludes to the familiarity of addressing another by a given name.
The western style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name is far from universal. In many countries it is common for people to have only one name (a mononym).

The Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park ([tpl]lang-de|Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer[/tpl]) is a national park in the Schleswig-Holstein area of the German Wadden Sea. It was founded by the Parliament of Schleswig-Holstein on 1 October 1985 by the National Park Act of 22 July 1985 and expanded significantly in 1999. Together with the Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park, the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park and those parts of Elbe estuary which are not nature reserves, it forms the German part of the Wadden Sea. 
The national park extends from the German-Danish maritime border in the north down to the Elbe estuary in the south. In the North Frisian area, it includes the mudflats around the geest-based and marsh islands and the Halligen (undyked islands). There the mudflats are 40 km wide in places. Further south lie areas of mudflats which contain particularly large sandbanks. In addition to the plants and animals that are typical of the entire Wadden Sea, especially large numbers of porpoise, shelduck and eelgrass may be seen in the Schleswig-Holstein part.
With an area of 4410 km ² it is by far the largest national park in Germany. Some 68% of its area is permanently under water and 30% is periodically dry. The land element consists mainly of salt marshes. Since 1990, the national park, including the North Frisian Halligen, has been designated as a UNESCO recognised biosphere. Together with other German and Dutch Wadden Sea areas it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 26 June 2009.

The Canadian War Museum (CWM) ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Musée canadien de la guerre[/tpl]) is Canada's national museum of military history.[tpl]cite web|author=Pierre Pontbriand |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC881805 |title=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=26 February 2011[/tpl] Located in Ottawa, Ontario, the museum covers all facets of Canada's military past, from the first recorded instances of death by armed violence in Canadian history several hundred years ago to the country's most recent involvement in conflicts. It includes major permanent exhibitions on wars that have been fought on Canadian soil, the total wars of the twentieth century, the Cold War and peace support operations abroad, and Canada's history of honouring and remembrance. There is also an open storage area displaying large objects from the Museum's collection, from naval guns to tanks, from motorcycles to jet aircraft. The exhibits depict Canada's military past in its personal, national and international dimensions, with special emphasis on the human experience of war and the manner in which war has affected, and been affected by, Canadians' participation.
Much of the Museum's public exhibition space is devoted to its Canadian Experience Galleries. These displays underline the profound effect that war has had on Canada's development and the significant role Canadians have played in international conflicts. Their content is a rich mixture of some 2,500 objects from war art to armoured vehicles, as well as scores of audio-visual displays and many hands-on activities. A changing program of temporary or special exhibitions, plus public programs and special events, complement the experience offered in the permanent galleries.
The CWM also houses the Military History Research Centre, a leading library and archival research facility, and a large collection of some 500,000 artifacts, including uniforms, medals, weapons, war art, aircraft, military vehicles and artillery.
The CWM originated in 1880. Its current building opened in May 2005 and is located less than 2 km west of Canada's Parliament Buildings. The building's architecture has received professional and public acclaim. The CWM is part of the Canadian Museum of History Corporation, which also operates the Canadian Museum of History, the Canadian Children's Museum, the Canadian Postal Museum, and the Virtual Museum of New France.

[[Weissenberg number]]
CATEGORIES: Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics, Fluid dynamics, Non-Newtonian fluids

The Weissenberg number (Wi) is a dimensionless number used in the study of viscoelastic flows. It is named after Karl Weissenberg. The dimensionless number is the ratio of the relaxation time of the fluid and a specific process time. For instance, in simple steady shear, the Weissenberg number, often abbreviated as Wi or We, is defined as the shear rate times the relaxation time
Since this number is obtained from scaling the evolution of the stress, it contains choices for the shear or elongation rate, and the length-scale. Therefore the exact definition of all non dimensional numbers should be given as well as the number itself.
While Wi is similar to the Deborah number and is often confused with it in technical literature, they have different physical interpretations. The Weissenberg number indicates the degree of anisotropy or orientation generated by the deformation, and is appropriate to describe flows with a constant stretch history, such as simple shear. In contrast, the Deborah number should be used to describe flows with a non-constant stretch history, and physically represents the rate at which elastic energy is stored or released.

Allen Balcom DuMont (January 29, 1901 – November 14, 1965) also spelled Du Mont, was an American electronics engineer, scientist and  inventor best known for improvements to the cathode ray tube in 1931 for use in television receivers. Seven years later he manufactured and sold the first commercially practical television set to the public. In June 1938, his Model 180 television receiver was the first all-electronic television set ever sold to the public, a few months prior to RCA's first set in April 1939. In 1946, DuMont founded the first television network to be licensed, the DuMont Television Network, initially by linking station WABD (named for DuMont) in New York City to station W3XWT, which later became WTTG, in Washington, D.C. (WTTG was named for Dr. Thomas T. Goldsmith, DuMont's Vice President of Research, and his best friend.) DuMont's successes in television picture tubes, TV sets and components and his involvement in commercial TV broadcasting made him the first millionaire in the business.

[[Oar]]

CATEGORIES: Water sports equipment, Rowing, Marine propulsion

An oar is an implement used for water-borne propulsion. Oars have a flat blade at one end. Oarsmen grasp the oar at the other end. The difference between oars and paddles are that paddles are held by the paddler, and are not connected with the vessel. Oars generally are connected to the vessel by means of rowlocks or tholes which transmit the applied force to the boat. In this system (known as a second class lever)[tpl]cite web|title=2011 FISA Rule Book|url=http://www.worldrowing.com/files/download/860|publisher=FISA|accessdate=19 January 2013|page=53[/tpl]  the water is the fulcrum.
Oarsmen generally face the stern of the vessel, reach as far as they can towards the stern, and insert the blade of their oar in the water. As they lean back, towards the vessel's bow, the blade of their oars sweeps the water towards the stern, providing forward thrust – see lever.
For thousands of years vessels were powered either by sails, or the mechanical work of oarsmen, or paddlers. Some ancient vessels were propelled by either oars or sail, depending on the speed and direction of the wind (see galley).

Arthur Dee (13 July 1579 – September or October 1651), the eldest son of Dr John Dee, was a physician and alchemist.
He was the eldest son of John Dee, by his second wife, Jane, daughter of Bartholomew Fromond of East Cheam, Surrey, and was born at Mortlake on 13 July 1579. He accompanied his father in travels through Germany, Poland, and Bohemia. After his return to England he was placed at Westminster School, 3 May 1592, under the tuition of Grant and Camden. Anthony Wood was informed that he subsequently studied at Oxford, but he took no degree, and his college is unknown.
Settling in London with the intention of practising 'physic' (medicine) he exhibited at the door of his house a list of medicines which were said to be certain cures for many diseases. The censors of the College of Physicians summoned him to appear before them; but it is not known with what outcome. Proceeding to Manchester, Dee  married Isabella, daughter of Edward Prestwych, justice of the peace.
Through the recommendation of James I he was appointed one of the physicians to the Tsar Michael I of Russia. He remained in Russia for about fourteen years, principally at Moscow. There he wrote his Fasciculus Chemicus, a collection of writings on alchemy.
Returning to England upon the death of his wife in 1637, Dee became physician to King Charles I. Upon his retirement Arthur Dee resided in Norwich, where he became a friend of Sir Thomas Browne. Arthur Dee died in September or October 1651, in Norwich and was buried in the church of St. George, Tombland. He had seven sons and six daughters. Dee's relationship to Browne has been little explored, but on his death it was to Browne that the bulk of Arthur Dee's alchemical manuscripts and books were bequeathed.

Although he was born in Middlesbrough, Trewavas spent much of his childhood in the Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury.[tpl]cite web|title=Edison's Children Official Website|url=http://www.edisonschildren.com/Pete_Trewavas.html|accessdate=14 May 2012[/tpl] It was in Aylesbury that he became involved in several bands, having most success with The Metros, before taking up his long term role in Marillion.
Although still a full member of Marillion, in recent years, Trewavas has also become a member of the progressive rock supergroup, Transatlantic. In 2004, Trewavas co-founded another group called Kino, with John Mitchell (Arena), John Beck (It Bites) and Chris Maitland (ex-Porcupine Tree).
In 2011, Pete Trewavas joined up with his longtime friend Eric Blackwood to form the duo Edison's Children. The new project was designed to be a creative outlet for Pete Trewavas (who has traditionally recorded in a "band" or "group" format on bass and acoustic guitar), in which he could also play lead guitar, lead vocals, drum programming and keyboards as well as have full creative control over the writing and producing of the record with. The 72 minute concept album "In The Last Waking Moments..." about a man fighting to understand if a recent bizarre happening was reality or a descent into madness, was released on 11.11.11.http://www.edisonschildren.com/About_Edisons_Children.html
The Edison's Children project would result in the release of the single "A Million Miles Away (I Wish I Had A Time Machine)". The song debuted on American Commercial Radio in June 2012 and by September it had reached the FMQB U.S. Commercial Radio Top 40 where it remained for 10 weeks (and stayed in the top 100 for 25 weeks) peaking at #32.http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=16693
Edison's Children did live performances in Montreal, Wolverhampton England and Port Zelande Netherlands opening up for Marillion's "Brave" performances during the Marillion 2013 Weekend. The Montreal show was recorded and released as a B-Side on their "In the Last Waking Moments..."-EP Single.
Edison's Children released their 2nd album "The Final Breath Before November" on December 13th 2013... a concept album about the supernatural and armageddon. It was mixed by Jakko Jakszyk, lead singer of King Crimson John Mitchell, lead guitarist of It Bites and Arena and Robin Boult, lead guitarist of Fish
On 17 September 2012 during a Marillion concert at The Junction in Cambridge, Steve Hogarth announced that Pete was now called "Sweet Pea Tremendous" as it was the result of putting Pete's name into an anagram solver. This new nickname was accepted by the crowd and stuck for the remainder of the night.
Trewavas has also appeared in Prog Aid, the charity project set up to raise money for victims of the 2004 tsunami.
Trewavas was a guest musician on English progressive rock band Big Big Train's 2007 album, The Difference Machine.
Though primarily a bassist, Trewavas has been known to write keyboard parts during his time with Transatlantic, and has played acoustic guitar on Marillion songs, particularly "Faith" and "Now She'll Never Know".

[[Inaccessible cardinal]]

CATEGORIES: Large cardinals

The term "inaccessible cardinal" is ambiguous. Until about 1950 it meant "weakly inaccessible cardinal", but since then it usually means "strongly inaccessible cardinal". 
Every strongly inaccessible cardinal is also weakly inaccessible, as every strong limit cardinal is also a weak limit cardinal. If the generalized continuum hypothesis holds, then a cardinal is strongly inaccessible if and only if it is weakly inaccessible.
The assumption of the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal is sometimes applied in the form of the assumption that one can work inside a Grothendieck universe, the two ideas being intimately connected.

Mahlo cardinals were first described by [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink= Paul Mahlo|first=Paul|last=Mahlo|year1=1911|year2=1912|year3=1913[/tpl].  As with all large cardinals,  none of these varieties of Mahlo cardinals can be proved to exist by ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent).
A cardinal number κ is called Mahlo if κ is inaccessible and the set U = {λ < κ: λ is inaccessible} is stationary in κ.
A cardinal κ is called weakly Mahlo if  κ is weakly inaccessible and the set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than κ is stationary in κ.

Norwich City Football Club is an English professional football club based in Norwich, Norfolk. During the 2012–13 Premier League season, Norwich City finished eleventh.
The club was founded in 1902 and first won promotion to the Football League First Division in 1972. Since then, Norwich have played a total of 23 seasons in the top flight, with a longest continuous spell of nine seasons. Norwich have won the League Cup twice, in 1962 and 1985, and the FA Youth Cup twice, in 1983 and 2013. They were founder members of the Premier League in 1992–93, finishing third in the inaugural season and played in its first three seasons, reaching the UEFA Cup 3rd round. Norwich most recently returned to the Premier League in 2011 after a six-year absence.Portsmouth 0–1 Norwich, BBC Sport website. Retrieved 2 May 2011.
Since 1935, Norwich have played their home games at Carrow Road and have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with East Anglian neighbours Ipswich Town, with whom they have contested the East Anglian derby 138 times.

[[Zero sharp]]

CATEGORIES: Real numbers, Determinacy, Large cardinals, Constructible universe

In the mathematical discipline of set theory, 0# (zero sharp, also 0#) is the set of true formulae about indiscernibles and order-indiscernables in the Gödel constructible universe. It is often encoded as a subset of the integers (using Gödel numbering), or as a subset of the hereditarily finite sets, or as a real number.  Its existence is  unprovable in ZFC, the standard form of axiomatic set theory, but follows from a suitable large cardinal axiom. It was first introduced as a set of formulae in Silver's 1966 thesis, later published as [tpl]harvtxt|Silver|1971[/tpl], where it was denoted by Σ, and rediscovered by  [tpl]harvtxt|Solovay|1967|loc=p.52[/tpl], who considered it as a subset of the natural numbers and introduced the notation O# (with a capital letter O; this later changed to a number 0).
Roughly speaking, if 0# exists then the universe V of sets is much larger than the universe L of constructible sets, while if it does not exist then the universe of all sets is closely approximated by the constructible sets.

[[Iron vote]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of the Republic of China

The "iron vote" is a political term for a voter that can be reliably counted on to vote for one party or another. This phrase was most notably used beginning as early as a decade ago[tpl]When|date=February 2013[/tpl] in Asian democratic elections, specifically Taiwan: Taiwanese ([tpl]zh-cp|c=鐵票|p=tiě piào[/tpl]. These usually include strong supporters of Taiwan independence or Chinese reunification.
The Kuomintang (KMT) was defeated in 2000 elections by the loss of iron votes. The result shows that "iron vote" can only be taken as reference. People who strongly believe in their "iron vote" may have an unexpected outcome. 
The same term is also used in Hong Kong, referring to strong supporters of the pro-democracy camp or the pro-Beijing camp.
A related term in United States politics is  yellow dog Democrat. The opposite is a swing voter.

Yellow Dog Democrats was a political term applied to voters in the Southern United States who voted solely for candidates who represented the Democratic Party, with the term originating in the late 19th century. These voters would allegedly "vote for a yellow dog before they would vote for any Republican".[tpl]Cite journal | title = A Solid Leader for Solid South | journal = LIFE | volume = 40 | issue = 21 | pages = pp. 31–35 | publisher = Time | location = Chicago | date = May 21, 1956 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=q0gEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34[/tpl] Page 34 "We're pretty much yellow-dog Democrats here," said an Arkansan last week, explaining the state would vote Democratic even if the party nominates a "yellow dog."[tpl]Cite journal | last = Morton | first = Julius Sterling | title = In Old Times | journal = The Conservative | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | page = p. 6 | publisher = Morton Print.

The Republican part of Nebraska, when its nomination to a state office was equivalent to an election, boasted that it could run "a yellow dog" for Governor and beat the best and ablest Democrat named for that office. The term is now more generally applied to refer to any Democrat who will vote a straight party ticket under any circumstances.
The phrase "yellow dog" may be a reference to a breed of dog known as the Carolina Dog indigenous to the Americas, specifically the Southern United States, and not descended from Eurasian breeds.[tpl]cite news|last=Hitt|first=Jack|title= D.N.A.

[[Indescribable cardinal]]

CATEGORIES: Large cardinals

In mathematics, a Q-indescribable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number that is hard to describe in some language Q. There are many different types of indescribable cardinals corresponding to different choices of languages Q. They were introduced by [tpl]harvtxt|Hanf|Scott|1961[/tpl]. 
A cardinal number κ is called Π[tpl]su|p=n|b=m[/tpl]-indescribable if for every Πm proposition φ, and set A ⊆ Vκ with (Vκ+n, ∈, A) ⊧ φ there exists an α < κ with (Vα+n, ∈, A ∩ Vα) ⊧ φ.
Here one looks at formulas with m-1 alternations of quantifiers with the outermost quantifier being universal. 
Σ[tpl]su|p=n|b=m[/tpl]-indescribable cardinals are defined in a similar way. The idea is that κ cannot be distinguished (looking from below) from smaller cardinals by any formula of n+1-th order logic with m-1 alternations of quantifiers even with the advantage of an extra unary predicate symbol (for A).  This implies that it is large because it means that there must be many smaller cardinals with similar properties.
The cardinal number κ is called totally indescribable if it is Π[tpl]su|p=n|b=m[/tpl]-indescribable for all positive integers m and n. 
If α is an ordinal, the cardinal number κ is called α-indescribable if for every formula φ and every subset U of Vκ 
such that φ(U) holds in Vκ+α there is a some λλ) holds in Vλ+α. If α is infinite then α-indescribable ordinals are totally indescribable, and if α is finite they are the same as Π[tpl]su|p=α|b=ω[/tpl]-indescribable ordinals.  α-indescribability implies that αλ) holds in Vλ+β.
Π[tpl]su|p=1|b=1[/tpl]-indescribable cardinals are the same as weakly compact cardinals.
A cardinal is inaccessible if and only if it is Π[tpl]su|p=0|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable for all positive integers n, equivalently iff it is Π[tpl]su|p=0|b=2[/tpl]-indescribable, equivalently iff it is Σ[tpl]su|p=1|b=1[/tpl]-indescribable.  A cardinal is Σ[tpl]su|p=1|b=n+1[/tpl]-indescribable iff it is Π[tpl]su|p=1|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable.  The property of being Π[tpl]su|p=1|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable is Π[tpl]su|p=1|b=n+1[/tpl].  For m>1, the property of being Π[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable is Σ[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl] and the property of being Σ[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable is Π[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl].  Thus, for m>1, every cardinal that is either Π[tpl]su|p=m|b=n+1[/tpl]-indescribable or Σ[tpl]su|p=m|b=n+1[/tpl]-indescribable is both Π[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable and Σ[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable and the set of such cardinals below it is stationary.  The consistency strength is Σ[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable cardinals is below that of Π[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable, but for m>1 it is consistent with ZFC that the least Σ[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable exists and is above the least Π[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable cardinal (this is proved from consistency of ZFC with Π[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable cardinal and a Σ[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl]-indescribable cardinal above it).
Measurable cardinals are Π[tpl]su|p=2|b=1[/tpl]-indescribable, but the smallest measurable cardinal is not Σ[tpl]su|p=2|b=1[/tpl]-indescribable. However there are many totally indescribable cardinals below any measurable cardinal. 
Totally indescribable cardinals remain totally indescribable in the constructible universe and in other canonical inner models, and similarly for Π[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl] and Σ[tpl]su|p=m|b=n[/tpl] indescribability.

CATEGORIES: Products introduced in 1986, Personal computers, Apple II computers, Snow White design language

The Apple IIGS (stylized as II[tpl]sc|gs[/tpl]) is the fifth and most powerful model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. The "GS" in the name stands for Graphics and Sound, referring to its enhanced multimedia capabilities, especially its state-of-the-art sound and music synthesis, which greatly surpassed previous models of the line and most contemporary machines like the Macintosh and IBM PC.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P2dClS4LdPQC&lpg=PA317&dq=apple%20IIgs%20review%20sound&pg=PA317#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Electronic and computer music By Peter Manning[/tpl]
The machine was a radical departure from any previous Apple II, with its true 16-bit architecture, increased processing speed, direct access to megabytes of RAM, wavetable music synthesizer, graphical user interface, and mouse. While still maintaining full backwards compatibility with earlier Apple II models, it blended the Apple II and aspects of Macintosh technology into one. Keeping with Apple's "Apple II Forever" slogan of the time, the IIGS set forth a promising future and evolutionary advancement of the Apple II line, but Apple paid it relatively little attention as the company increasingly focused on the Macintosh platform.
The Apple IIGS was the first computer produced by Apple to use a color graphical user interface, as well as the "Platinum" (light grey) color scheme and the Apple Desktop Bus interface for keyboards, mice, and other input devices. It was also the first personal computer to come with a built-in "wavetable" sample-based synthesizer chip, utilizing technology from Ensoniq. The machine outsold all other Apple products, including the Macintosh, during its first year in production.

[[Wexis]]
CATEGORIES: United States law, Legal research

Wexis is a humorous portmanteau used to refer to the alleged duopoly of publishing conglomerates that dominate the U.S. legal information services industry – namely, West Publishing and LexisNexis.Jean McKnight, "Wexis versus the Net," Illinois Bar Journal 85, no. 4 (April 1997): 189-190.
Neither of these companies is independent – they are parts of much larger conglomerates that dominate the entire information services sector. West is owned by Thomson Reuters, while LexisNexis is a division of Reed Elsevier.
These companies dispute the allegation that they are a duopoly; LexisNexis actually sued one company which used the terms "Wexis" and "duopoly" in its marketing literature.Anonymous, "LexisNexis wins first phase of legal battle with competitor," Business First-Columbus, 29 June 2001, A13; see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.

[[Inert gas]]
CATEGORIES: Noble gases, Gases, Industrial gases

An inert gas is a gas which does not undergo chemical reactions under a set of given conditions. The noble gases and nitrogen often do not react with many substances.[tpl]GoldBookRef | file = I03027 | title = inert gas[/tpl] Inert gases are used generally to avoid unwanted chemical reactions degrading a sample. These undesirable chemical reactions are often oxidation and hydrolysis reactions with the oxygen and moisture in air. The term inert gas is context-dependent because nitrogen gas and several of the noble gases can be made to react under certain conditions.
Purified nitrogen and argon gases are most commonly used as inert gases due to their high natural abundance (78% N2, 1% Ar in air) and low relative cost.
Unlike noble gases, an inert gas is not necessarily elemental and is often a compound gas. Like the noble gases the tendency for non-reactivity is due to the valence, the outermost electron shell, being complete in all the inert gases.Singh, Jasvinder. The Sterling Dictionary of Physics. New Delhi, India: Sterling, 2007. 122. This is a tendency, not a rule, as noble gases and other "inert" gases can react to form compounds.

Asphodelus ramosus, also known as branched asphodel, is a perennial herb in the Asparagales order. Similar in appearance to Asphodelus albus and particularly Asphodelus cerasiferus, it may be distinguished by its highly branched stem and smaller fruits.
In addition, at least on the Catalan coast where it is very common, in contrast to other asphodels, it shows an affinity for acidic soils, mainly schist. It is to be found close to the sea on the slopes of the Albères massif, where it forms abundant colonies in April to May. Its very numerous flowers are white with six tepals bearing a central brown streak. The fruits are small round capsules.

[[Space charge]]
CATEGORIES: Electricity, Theories, Microwave technology, Vacuum tubes, Mass spectrometry

Space charge is a concept in which excess electric charge is treated as a continuum of charge distributed over a region of space (either a volume or an area) rather than distinct point-like charges. This model typically applies when charge carriers have been emitted from some region of a solid—the cloud of emitted carriers can form a space charge region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules left behind in the solid can form a space charge region. Space charge usually only occurs in dielectric media (including vacuum) because in a conductive medium the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or screened. The sign of the space charge can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a metal object when it is heated to incandescence in a vacuum. This effect was first observed by Thomas Edison in light bulb filaments, where it is sometimes called the Edison effect, but space charge is a significant phenomenon in many vacuum and solid-state electronic devices.

The Gaia hypothesis, also known as Gaia theory or Gaia principle, proposes that organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings on Earth to form a self-regulating, complex system that contributes to maintaining the conditions for life on the planet. Topics of interest include how the biosphere and the evolution of life forms affect the stability of global temperature, ocean salinity, oxygen in the atmosphere and other environmental variables that affect the habitability of Earth.
The hypothesis, which is named after the Greek goddess Gaia, was formulated by the scientist James Lovelock[tpl]cite journal|last=Lovelock|first=J.E.|title=Gaia as seen through the atmosphere|journal=Atmospheric Environment (1967)|date=1 August 1972|volume=6|issue=8|pages=579–580|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(72)90076-5|publisher=Elsevier|issn=1352-2310|ref=harv[/tpl] and co-developed by the microbiologist Lynn Margulis in the 1970s.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lovelock|first=James E.|coauthors=Margulis, Lynn|title=Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the Gaia hypothesis|journal=Tellus|date=1 February 1974|volume=26|series=Series A|issue=1–2|pages=2–10|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x|url=http://tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/9731|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=International Meteorological Institute|location=Stockholm|issn=1600-0870|ref=harv[/tpl] While early versions of the hypothesis were criticized for being teleological and contradicting principles of natural selection, later refinements have resulted in ideas highlighted by the Gaia Hypothesis being used in subjects such as geophysiology, Earth system science, biogeochemistry, systems ecology, and climate science.[tpl]cite book |author=Schwartzman, David |title=Life, Temperature, and the Earth: The Self-Organizing Biosphere |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-231-10213-5 [/tpl]Gribbin, John (1990), "Hothouse earth: The greenhouse effect and Gaia" (Wiedenfield and Nicholson) In 2006, the Geological Society of London awarded Lovelock the Wollaston Medal largely for his work on the Gaia theory.[tpl]Cite journal|author1=John R.

[[Duke of Clarence]]

CATEGORIES: Dukedoms in the Peerage of England, Extinct dukedoms in the Peerage of England

Duke of Clarence is a title which has been traditionally awarded to junior members of the English and British Royal families. The first three creations were in the Peerage of England, the fourth in the Peerage of Great Britain, and the fifth in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.
The title was first granted to Lionel of Antwerp, the third son of King Edward III, in 1362. Since he died without sons, the title became extinct. The title was again created in favour of Thomas of Lancaster, the second son of King Henry IV, in 1412. Upon his death, too, the title became extinct. The last creation in the Peerage of England was for George Plantagenet, brother of King Edward IV, in 1461. The Duke forfeited his title in 1478, after he had been convicted of treason against his brother. He allegedly met his end (according to William Shakespeare) by being drowned in a butt of Malmsey. 
A fourth creation in England was suggested and planned to take effect; the title of Duke of Clarence was going to be given to Lord Guilford Dudley, husband of Lady Jane Grey, upon her coronation, as she declined to make her husband king consort. However, she was deposed before this could take effect.
The next creation (Duke of Clarence and St Andrews) was in 1789 for Prince William, third son of King George III. When Prince William succeeded his brother to the throne in 1830, the dukedom merged in the crown.
The most recent creation (Duke of Clarence and Avondale) was for Prince Albert Victor of Wales, the eldest son of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). This was the last royal dukedom to be created with two territorial designations. The Duke died of pneumonia in 1892 and the title again became extinct.
The title also took the form of an earldom for Queen Victoria's son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and his son Prince Charles Edward, the Clarence earldom being a subsidiary title. 
The title is said to originatePolydore Vergil, in his Anglica Historia of 1534 (Book XIX.36) dates the Dukedom to 1361 and claims to have rediscovered the lost origins of the name. See also David Hatton, Clare, Suffolk, an account of historical features of the town, its Priory and its Parish Church, 2006, Book 1, p21 ISBN 0-9524242-3-1 It is also available online on the Clare website. However, other writers, e.g., T.A. Trant, Narrative of a Journey Through Greece (London: 1830) p4, trace the title Dux Clarentiae to Clarentia (Glarentza) in the Peloponnese, seat of Matilda of Hainaut (aka Maud, Mahaut), Princess of Achaea from 1313-1318, from whom her cousin Philippa of Hainault might have passed to her son Lionel at least an honorific claim to Achaea. from the town of Clare, Suffolk, which was owned by the first duke of Clarence, Lionel of Antwerp. His wife, Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster, was a direct descendant of the previous owners, the de Clares, and the Manor of Clare was among the lands which she brought to her husband."Dukes of Clarence", Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911). After the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the holders of the title were also given titles including Scottish place names: St Andrews and Avondale.

A booby trap is a device or setup that is intended to kill, harm or surprise a person, unknowingly triggered by the presence or actions of the victim. As the word trap implies, they often have some form of bait designed to lure the victim towards it. However, in other cases the device is placed on busy roads or is triggered when the victim performs some type of everyday action e.g. opening a door, picking something up or switching something on. Booby traps should not be confused with mantraps which are designed to catch a person. Lethal booby traps are often used in warfare, particularly guerrilla warfare, and traps designed to cause injury or pain are also sometimes used by criminals wanting to protect drugs or other illicit property, and by some owners of legal property who wish to protect it from theft. Booby traps which merely cause discomfort or embarrassment are a popular form of practical joke.

[[East Fortune]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in East Lothian

East Fortune is a village in East Lothian, Scotland, located 2 miles (3 km) north west of East Linton.  The area is known for its airfield which was constructed in 1915 to help protect Britain from attack by German Zeppelin airships during the First World War.  The RNAS airship station also included an airship hangar.  In 1919 the British airship R34 made the first airship crossing of the Atlantic, flying from East Fortune to Mineola, New York.http://heritage.scotsman.com/ingenuity.cfm?id=430902005
In 1922 several buildings and an area of land were used to create East Fortune Hospital.  This served as a tuberculosis sanatorium for the south east region of Scotland until the onset of World War II.  The airfield was then brought back into service as RAF East Fortune, initially a training airfield, and the hospital patients were transferred to Bangour Hospital in West Lothian. The hospital re-opened after the war, but by 1956, as the number of tuberculosis patients began to fall, the hospital changed its function to house the mentally handicapped.  In 1997, the hospital closed down, and its patients were transferred to Roodlands Hospital in Haddington.
For a short period in 1961, East Fortune operated as Edinburgh's airport while facilities at Turnhouse were being reconstructed.
In 1975, the National Museum of Flight was opened at the airfield, and has since become a popular tourist attraction.  It is also home to a Concorde, G-BOAA from the decommissioned British Airways fleet, which forms the centrepiece of a major exhibition about the Concorde programme.

[[Principle of double effect]]

CATEGORIES: Bioethics, Thomism, Ethical principles

The principle of double effect — also known as the rule of double effect; the doctrine of double effect, often abbreviated as DDE or PDE, double-effect reasoning; or simply double effect — is a set of ethical criteria which Christians, and some others, use for evaluating the permissibility of acting when one's otherwise legitimate act (for example, relieving a terminally ill patient's pain) may also cause an effect one would normally be obliged to avoid (sedation and a slightly shortened life). Double-effect originates in Thomas Aquinas's treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work Summa Theologiae.''Summa Theologiae, IIa-IIae Q. 64, art. 7
This set of criteria states that an action having foreseen harmful effects practically inseparable from the good effect is justifiable if the following are true:

[[Sinecure]]
CATEGORIES: Canon law (Anglican Communion), Common law

A sinecure (from Latin sine = "without" and cura = "care") means an office that requires or involves little or no responsibility, labour, or active service. The term originated in the medieval church, where it signified a post without any responsibility for the "care of souls", the regular liturgical and pastoral functions of a cleric, but came to be applied to any post, secular or ecclesiastical, that involved little or no actual work. Sinecures have historically provided a potent tool for governments or monarchs to distribute patronage, while recipients are able to store up titles and easy salaries.
A sinecure is not necessarily a figurehead, which generally requires active participation in government, albeit with a lack of power.
A sinecure can also be given to an individual whose primary job is in another office, but requires a sinecure title to perform that job. For example, the Government House Leader in Canada is often given a sinecure ministry position so that she or he may become a member of the Cabinet. Similar examples are the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the British cabinet. Other sinecures operate as legal fictions, such as the British office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, used as a legal excuse for resigning from Parliament.

[[Upper Canada Rebellion]]

CATEGORIES: Upper Canada Rebellion, Political history of Canada

The Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the oligarchic government of the British colony of Upper Canada (present day Ontario) in December 1837. While public grievances had existed for years, it was the Rebellion in Lower Canada (present day Quebec) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt soon after. The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) - mainly through the support of the Hunters' Lodges, a secret anti-British, American-based militia that emerged in states around the Great Lakes. They launched the Patriot War in 1838-39.  The rebellion led directly to Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America and to The British North America Act, 1840 which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system. Some historians argue that the rebellions in 1837 should be viewed in the wider context of the late-18th- and early-19th-century Atlantic revolutions. The American Revolutionary war in 1776, the French Revolution of 1789–1799, the Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804, the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and the independence struggles of Spanish America (1810–1825) were inspired by similar democratic ideals, although they were tinged with republicanism as well.  Great Britain's Chartists sought similar democratic goals.Ducharme, Michel (2010) Le concept de liberté au Canada à l’époque des Révolutions atlantiques (1776-1838) McGill/Queens University Press: Montreal/Kingston.

CATEGORIES: 1937 books, German-language literature, Infantry, History books about World War I, Military strategy books, Personal accounts of World War I, Erwin Rommel

Infanterie Greift An (known as Infantry Attacks in English), is a classic book on military tactics written by German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel about his experiences in World War I. Rommel describes his Stoßtruppen (shock troops) tactics, which used speed, deception, and deep penetration into enemy territory to surprise and overwhelm. Throughout the book, Rommel reports assigning small numbers of men to approach enemy lines from the direction in which attack was expected. The men would yell, throw hand grenades and otherwise simulate the anticipated attack from concealment, while attack squads and larger bodies of men sneaked to the flanks and rears of the defenders to take them by surprise.  These tactics often intimidated enemies into surrendering, thus avoiding unnecessary exertion, expenditure of ammunition, and risk of injury.
Infanterie Greift An was first published in 1937 and helped to persuade Adolf Hitler to give Rommel high command in World War II, although he was not from an old military family or the Prussian aristocracy, which had traditionally dominated the German officer corps. Infanterie Greift An was printed in Germany until 1945. By then, about 500,000 copies had been published. 
In 1943, an abridged version titled, more simply, "ATTACKS!" was released by the US military for officers' tactical study.
Rommel's book, written as a day to day journal of his World War I exploits, was used throughout the West as a resource for infantry tactical movements. General George S. Patton was among the many influential military leaders reported to have read "Infantry Attacks".Patton, G. S. : War As I Knew It, page 166. Mariner Books, 1995.
Rommel planned to write a successor called Panzer Greift An (in English: Tank attacks) about tank warfare, and gathered much material during the North Africa Campaign. However, he died before completing this work.

Peptide hormones are proteins that have endocrine functions in living animals.Peptide Hormone Secretion/Peptide Hormone Action: A Practical Approach, K. Siddle, J. C. Hutton, Oxford University Press, 1991, ISBN 0-19-963073-9.
Like other proteins, peptide hormones are synthesized in cells from amino acids according to mRNA transcripts, which are synthesized from DNA templates inside the cell nucleus. Preprohormones, peptide hormone precursors, are then processed in several stages, typically in the endoplasmic reticulum, including removal of the N-terminal signal sequence and sometimes glycosylation, resulting in prohormones. The prohormones are then packaged into membrane-bound secretory vesicles, which can be secreted from the cell by exocytosis in response to specific stimuli (e.g. --an increase in Ca2+ and cAMP concentration in cytoplasm).Peptide Hormone Secretion: A Practical Approach, J. C. Hutton, Hull University Press, 1991, ISBN 0-19-963068-2.
These prohormones often contain superfluous amino acid residues that were needed to direct folding of the hormone molecule into its active configuration but have no function once the hormone folds. Specific endopeptidases in the cell cleave the prohormone just before it is released into the bloodstream, generating the mature hormone form of the molecule. Mature peptide hormones then travel through the blood to all of the cells of the body, where they interact with specific receptors on the surfaces of their target cells. Some peptide/protein hormones (angiotensin II, basic fibroblast growth factor-2, parathyroid hormone-related protein) also interact with intracellular receptors located in the cytoplasm or nucleus by an intracrine mechanism.The Endocrine System in Sports and Exercise, William J. Kraemer, Alan D. Rogol, Blackwell Publishing, 2005, ISBN 1-4051-3017-2.

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth races, Fictional goblins, Fictional cannibals, Orcs, Middle-earth Orcs

In J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy writings, Orcs or Orks are a race of creatures who are used as soldiers and henchmen by both the greater and lesser villains of The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings — Morgoth, Sauron and Saruman.
Although not entirely dim-witted and occasionally crafty, they are portrayed as miserable beings, hating everyone including themselves and their masters, whom they serve out of fear. They make no beautiful things, but rather design cunning devices made to hurt and destroy.
In some of his unpublished early work, Tolkien appears to distinguish orcs from goblins. By the time of his published work, however, the terms had become synonymous.  The Hobbit generally uses the term goblin, while the Lord of the Rings prefers orc.  The opponents of the dwarves in "Dwarf and Goblin War" of The Hobbit are described as orcs in Appendix A of The Lord of the Rings. No distinction is made by size; large orcs, including the Uruk-hai, are just as much goblins as are smaller ones.

It most commonly refers to electrically excitable muscle cells or neurons. Absolute refractory period corresponds to depolarisation and repolarisation, whereas relative refractory period corresponds to hyperpolarisation.

[[Túrin Turambar]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth Edain, Characters in The Silmarillion, Characters in The Children of Húrin, Fictional people who committed suicide, Fictional characters introduced in 1917

Túrin Turambar (pronounced [tpl]IPA-art|ˈtuːrɪn tuˈrambar|[/tpl]) is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. "Turambar and the Foalókë", begun in 1917, is the first appearance of Túrin in the legendarium. J.R.R. Tolkien consciously based the story on the medieval tale of Kullervo in the Finnish mythological poem Kalevala, saying that it was "an attempt to reorganize...the tale of Kullervo the hapless, into a form of my own".[tpl]ME-ref|Letters|p. 214[/tpl] Also called "The Tale of Grief", "Narn i Chîn Húrin", commonly called "The Narn", it tells of the tragic fates of the children of Húrin, namely his son Túrin (Turambar) and his daughter Nienor. Excerpts of the story were published before, in The Silmarillion (prose), Unfinished Tales (prose), The Book of Lost Tales Part II (prose), The Lays of Beleriand (verse in alliterative long-lines) and most recently in 1994 in The War of the Jewels (prose), the latter three part of The History of Middle-earth series. 
Túrin Turambar is the primary protagonist and tragic hero of the novel The Children of Húrin, published after Tolkien's death by his son Christopher Tolkien and drawing from many of the above sources to finally present a complete narrative. His title, "Turambar", means master of fate. Later, on his tombstone, it was written, "...Master of Fate, yet by fate mastered," concluding his tragedy, and ultimately showing his failure to achieve his goals of escaping the curse ill fate Morgoth had cast upon him.
In the books, Túrin was a Man of the First Age of Middle-earth, whose family had been cursed by the ultimate evil being of the legendarium, Morgoth. In course of his unsuccessful attempts to defy the curse, Túrin brought ruin upon several Mannish and Elven strongholds as well as upon himself and his sister Nienor Níniel. Their history was recorded in the Tale of the Children of Húrin or Narn i Chîn Húrin, which was claimed by Tolkien to be the ultimate source of the published writings.[tpl]ME-ref|MR|"Myths Transformed" (I), p. 373 and note 2[/tpl]
Túrin is briefly mentioned in The Fellowship of the Ring, but little more is said than that he was one of "the mighty Elf-friends of old".  In The Two Towers, his name is briefly mentioned as a strong warrior.

[[Maglor]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in The Silmarillion, Fictional characters introduced in 1977, Fictional poets, Fictional princes, High Elves, Noldor

In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, Maglor ([tpl]IPA-art|ˈmaɡlor[/tpl]) is a fictional character, the second son of Fëanor and Nerdanel.  Born in the years of the trees, his final fate is unknown.  He was the second greatest poet and bard of the Noldor and was said to have inherited more of his mother's gentler temperament.
Maglor is a Sindarin rendering of his Quenya mother name Makalaurë (or Macalaurë), which means "Gold-cleaver" — alluding to his skill with the harp, and possibly the power of his voice. (He was also known as "Strong-voiced" and "the Mighty Singer".) The meaning behind Maglor's father name, Kanafinwë (or Canafinwë), is uncertain, but probably contains the prefix kana/o (commanding) + Finwë.
As with the other Sons of Fëanor, Maglor was bound by the Oath of Fëanor to recover his father's Silmarils, from whoever possessed them, as the jewels had been stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth. This oath took Fëanor and his seven sons to Middle-earth during the First Age where the sons established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Morgoth, fought their own Elvish kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves and their followers.
Maglor was briefly the leader of the Fëanorians after Fëanor had died in Dagor-nuin-Giliath and his oldest son Maedhros had been imprisoned by Morgoth after he was trapped and captured in a phoney parley. It is not known if Maglor tried to rescue his elder brother. Under his leadership, the Noldor built a fortified camp on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim, after Maglor had refused Morgoth's demands. The Noldor had their first contact with the Grey-elves and the Falathrim during this, and these meetings were "glad".
It seems Maglor chose neither to confront nor to reconcile with the House of Fingolfin, his uncle, who was forced to lead his followers and those of the House of Finarfin into Hithlum through the Helcaraxë (grinding ice of the north) because Maglor's father ordered the ships of the Teleri to be burned that had carried Fëanor's house across the sea. The Fëanorians left their camp and withdrew to the Southern shore of Lake Mithrim. Maglor did not act on the feelings of shame and repentance of his followers.
Maglor went east with his brothers and was responsible for defending a plain between mountain ranges Maglor's Gap with a large force of riders. His relationship with the other Noldor princes seemed to mirror that of his older brother Maedhros who desired to unify against Morgoth. Maglor was present with many warriors from east Beleriand at the "Feast of Reuniting", Mereth Aderthad, hosted by Fingolfin in [tpl]ME-date|YS|20[/tpl] near the Pools of Ivrin. Daeron, the greatest bard of the elves was also there, but nothing is said of the meeting of Maglor and Daeron. Finrod, son of Finarfin, hunted with Maedhros and Maglor in Estolad just before he met the Edain for the first time. Maglor's Gap, the March of Maedhros and Dor Caranthir (Thargelion) seem to be the only places that had been named after Fëanorian lords in Beleriand.
Maglor's Gap was breached during Dagor Aglareb, although the Fëanorians managed to destroy the Orc bands that had passed south. Maglor and Maedhros beat back an attack by Morgoth in Y.S. 402 aided by Angrod and Aegnor, sons of Finarfin. In Dagor Bragollach, the forces of Angband, with Glaurung the dragon at their head, overran Maglor's Gap, and Maglor retreated to the stronghold of Maedhros after his horsemen had been burnt in the plain of Lothlann. After the great defeat of the Union of Maedhros in Y.S. 473, he retreated with his brothers to Mount Dolmed. It is unclear whether he lived in Ossiriand or at Amon Ereb, where Maedhros chose to live. Maglor later took part in the Fëanorian attacks to recover a Silmaril on Doriath and on the Havens of Sirion, and survived these battles. After the sacking of Sirion, Maglor also saved and fostered the sons of Eärendil, Elrond and Elros. The Silmarillion indicates that a bond of love had grown between Maglor and Elros and Elrond.
After the War of Wrath, he and his last surviving brother, Maedhros stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter he wandered along the shores of the world, singing laments over the loss of the jewel, until he faded from memory.  Maglor, along with Galadriel and Gil-galad, was the greatest surviving Noldo at the beginning of the Second Age. There is speculation that he remained even after the Third Age in Middle-earth, forbidden forever from returning to Valinor. It is also possible that Maglor did not, in fact, survive into the Second Age, but instead perished when Beleriand sank into the Sea in the War of Wrath.
It is curious that Maglor was assigned to guard the most vulnerable part of the Fëanorian defences, although there is no indication of his being the most gifted rider or a fierce warrior. Maglor killed Uldor the Accursed after his betrayal of the Union of Maedhros in the fifth battle.
Tolkien refers to Maglor as one of Fëanor's sons that were probably married, but we have no information on his wife or any children.  Maglor composed the song "The Fall of The Noldor" (Noldolantë), although nothing but its title is known.

CATEGORIES: 15th-century births, 1493 deaths, English soldiers, Blount family, 15th-century English people, People of the Tudor period, 15th-century soldiers, English knights

Sir James Blount (died 1493) (sometimes spelt Blunt) was commander of the English fortress of Hammes, near Calais. When in 1484 the Earl of Oxford was imprisoned there, Blount was apparently persuaded to switch to the Lancastrian side. Blount and Oxford fled to join Henry Tudor (the future Henry VII of England), leaving his wife in charge. She and the garrison held out for months against Richard III's forces, until in early 1485 they surrendered in return for safe passage into France.
Blount was the son of Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy, and uncle of William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy.
Blount appears as a minor character in Shakespeare's Richard III.

[[Marcha Real]]

CATEGORIES: Royal anthems, National anthems, Spanish songs, National symbols of Spain

The [tpl]lang|es|Marcha Real[/tpl] ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈmartʃa reˈal[/tpl], "Royal March") is the national anthem of Spain. It is one of only three national anthems (along with that of Bosnia and Herzegovina, San Marino in the world to have no official lyrics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nationalanthems.me/spain-marcha-real/|title=Spain - Marcha Real|publisher=NationalAnthems.me|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]
One of the oldest in the world, the anthem was first printed in a document dated 1761 and entitled  Libro de la Ordenanza de los Toques de Pífanos y Tambores que se tocan nuevamente en la Ynfantª Española (Book of the Ordenance of Newly Played Military Drum and Fife Calls by The Spanish Infantry), by Manuel de Espinosa. Here it is entitled [tpl]lang|es|La Marcha Granadera[/tpl] ("March of the Grenadiers"). According to this document, Manuel de Espinosa de los Monteros is the composer.
There is a false belief that Marcha Real's author was Frederick II of Prussia, a great lover of music. This belief started in 1861 when it appears for the first time publied in [tpl]lang|es|La España militar[/tpl] (The Militar Spain). In 1864, the colonel Antonio Vallecillo publishes the history in the diary [tpl]lang|es|El Espíritu Público[/tpl] (The Public Spirit), making the supposed Prussian origin of Marcha Real popular. According to Vallecillo, the anthem was a gift from Frederick II to the soldier Juan Martín Álvarez de Sotomayor, who was serving in the Prussian Court to learn the military tactics developed by Frederick II's army, under orders of King Charles III. In 1868 the history is published in [tpl]lang|es|Los Sucesos[/tpl], changing the destinatary of the gift with Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, Count of Aranda. The myth was picked up like this in different publications of 1884 and 1903, until being included in 1908 in the Enciclopedia Espasa.
According to the tradition in 1770, Charles III declared the Marcha de Granaderos as the official Honor March, and with that formalized the habit of playing it in public and solemn acts. It became the official anthem during Isabel II's reign.
After the 1868 Revolution, General Prim convoked a national contest to create an official anthem, but it was declared deserted, advising the jury that Marcha de Granaderos was considered as such. By Alfonso XIII's time, it was established by a Royal Circular Order (27 August 1908) that interpreted the harmonization of the march done by Bartolomé Pérez Casas, Major Music of the Royal Corps of Halberdier Guards. During the Second Republic, Himno de Riego was adopted as official anthem, although after the Spanish Civil War, Marcha Real returned to be used as anthem, sometimes sung with the verses written by the poet José María Pemán in 1928.
The actual symphonic version of the Marcha Real that replaces the Pérez Casas one, belongs to maestro Francisco Grau and is the official one after the Royal Decree of 10 October 1997, when the Kingdom of Spain bought the author rights of the Marcha Real, then belonging to Pérez Casas' Heirs. According to the Royal Decree 1560/1997, the anthem should have a tone of B major and a tempo of 76 bpm (♩=76), with a form of AABB and a duration of 52 seconds.
Under the Trienio Liberal (1820-1823), the First Spanish Republic (1873–74) (when it enjoyed of a co-officiality) and the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939), [tpl]lang|es|El Himno de Riego[/tpl] replaced [tpl]lang|es|La Marcha Real[/tpl] as the national anthem of Spain. At the conclusion of the Civil War, however, Francisco Franco restored [tpl]lang|es|La Marcha Real[/tpl] as the country's national anthem, under its old title of [tpl]lang|es|La Marcha Granadera[/tpl].

[[Black Mass]]
CATEGORIES: Christian mythology, Satanism

A Black Mass is a ceremony supposedly celebrated during the Witches' Sabbath, which was a sacrilegious parody of the Catholic Mass.Rhodes, H.T.F. The Satanic Mass, 1954. Its main objective was the profanation of the host, although there is no agreement among authors on how hosts were obtained or profaned; the most common idea is that they were profaned by means of some ritual related to sexual practices.Summers, Montague, The History of Witchcraft, 1926, ch. IV, The Sabbat  Authors also disagree on which rites were performed during the ceremony.  Some medieval writers believed that the host was replaced by a toad, a turnip or a piece of dry flesh, but most judges and authors believed that true hosts were given by Christian priests, who had made diabolical pacts, to the attendants of the Sabbath to be profaned by them.
It is not clear if the Black Mass was ever celebrated in medieval times; the works referring to them are lurid and unreliable manuals for witch-hunters written in Latin, such as the Malleus Maleficarum (1486) and the Compendium Maleficarum (1608), and it may have served solely as a shocking act with which to accuse enemies.

[[Yamato period]]

CATEGORIES: Kofun period, Asuka period

The [tpl]nihongo|Yamato period|大和時代|Yamato-jidai[/tpl] is the period of Japanese history when the Japanese Imperial court ruled from modern-day Nara Prefecture, then known as Yamato Province.
While conventionally assigned to the period 250–710 (including both the Kofun period (c 150-538) and the Asuka period (538-710)), the actual start of Yamato rule is disputed. The Yamato court's supremacy was challenged during the Kofun period by other polities centered in various parts of Japan. At least it is certain that Yamato clans had major advantages over their neighbouring clans at the 6th century.
This period is divided by the relocation of the capital to Asuka, in modern Nara Prefecture, into the Kofun and Asuka periods. However, the kofun period is an archaeological period while the Asuka period is a historical period. Therefore, many think this is an old division and this concept of period division is not popular in Japan now.
At the era of Prince Shōtoku in the early 7th century, a new constitution was prescribed for Japan based on the Chinese model. After the fall of Baekje (660 AD), the Yamato government sent envoys directly to the Chinese court, from which they obtained a great wealth of philosophical and social structure. In addition to ethics and government, they also adopted the Chinese calendar and many of its religious practices, including Confucianism and Taoism (Japanese: Onmyo).

[tpl]nihongo|Yamato Province|大和国|Yamato no Kuni[/tpl] was a province of Japan, located in Kinai, corresponding to present-day Nara Prefecture in Honshū.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Yamato" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia, p. 1046|page=1046[/tpl]. It was also called [tpl]nihongo|Washū|和州[/tpl]. At first, the name was written with one different character ([tpl]lang|ja|大倭[/tpl]; cf. Names of Japan), and for about ten years after 737, this was revised to use more desirable characters ([tpl]lang|ja|大養徳[/tpl]). The final revision was made in the second year of the Tenpyō-hōji era (c. 758). It is classified as a great province in the Engishiki. 
The name Yamato derives from the Yamato people[tpl]fact|date=March 2013[/tpl]; the Yamato Period in the history of Japan refers to the late Kofun Period (c. 250–538) and Asuka Period (538–710). Japanese archaeologists and historians emphasize the fact that during the early Kofun Period the Yamato chieftainship was in close contention with other regional powers, such as Kibi Province near present-day Okayama Prefecture. Around the 6th century, the local chieftainship gained national control and established the Imperial court in Yamato Province.
The battleship Yamato, the flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet during the World War II, was named after this ancient province.

This is a list of heritage, private and preserved railways in the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands that are privately owned, kept or preserved, built, constructed and run for railway heritage and/or profit, not necessarily providing a meaningful public transportation service. For rail museums, see List of British railway museums.
Many of the standard-gauge railways (thus including former ex-branch lines and former ex-mainline routes) listed were originally closed by British Railways (later shortened to British Rail) under the Beeching Cuts in the 1960s, although lines closed in subsequent decades have also been subject to restoration and operation as private or preserved heritage lines.  A smaller number of lines were formerly industrial or colliery railways.
Many of these preserved railways, heritage lines and railway centres alike are popular tourist attractions and make significant contributions to their local economies.

The party is officially committed to left-wing democratic socialism. The Socialist Party USA, along with its predecessors, has received varying degrees of support when its candidates have competed against those from the Republican and Democratic parties.

SDUSA was founded in 1972 when the Socialist Party of America renamed itself Social Democrats, USA.[ref]
The New York Times reported on the Convention for three other days:
SDUSA's organizational activities included sponsoring discussions and issuing position papers; it was known mainly because of its members' activities in other organizations. SDUSA included  civil-rights activists and leaders of labor unions, such as  Bayard Rustin, Norman Hill, and Tom Kahn of the AFL–CIO, and Sandra Feldman and Rachelle Horowitz of the American Federation of Teachers. SDUSA members helped to support free labor-unions; in particular, Tom Kahn organized the AFL–CIO's support of Poland's Solidarity.[tpl]harvtxt|Shevis|1981|p=32[/tpl] Penn Kemble and Carl Gershman cooperated with Republican and Democratic administrations on democracy promotion. Other members included the  philosopher Sidney Hook.  The group supports Democratic socialist anti-communism.
SDUSA ceased operations in 2005, following the death of Penn Kemble. In 2008–2009 two small organizations emerged, each proclaiming  itself to be the successor to SDUSA.

Besides acting as narrators and actors in radio plays, as well as performing voice-overs for non-Japanese movies and television programs, the voice actors are extensively employed as character actors in anime and video games. Some voice actors — especially certain voice actresses — often have devoted international fan-clubs.

The freehold of the track and stations is owned by Somerset County Council; the railway is leased to and operated by West Somerset Railway plc (WSR plc); which is supported and minority owned by charitable trust the West Somerset Railway Association (WSRA). The WSR plc operates services using both heritage steam and diesel trains.
It originally opened in 1862 between [tpl]stnlnk|Taunton[/tpl] and [tpl]stnlnk|Watchet[/tpl]. In 1874 it was extended from Watchet to [tpl]stnlnk|Minehead[/tpl] by the Minehead Railway. Although just a single track, improvements were needed in the first half of the twentieth century to accommodate the significant number of tourists that wished to travel to the Somerset coast. Despite this traffic, the line was closed by British Rail in 1971 but was then reopened (just five years later) in 1976 as a heritage line.
It is currently the longest standard gauge heritage railway in the United Kingdom. Services normally operate over just the [tpl]convert|20.5|mi|km[/tpl] between Minehead and [tpl]stnlnk|Bishops Lydeard[/tpl].

Within a set positive numbers, a number is small if it is close to zero. A number is smaller if it is less than another number.
Within a set of positive and negative numbers there is ambiguity, because being closer to zero does not correspond to being less, but to being less in absolute value. Depending on context a negative number may be called "smaller" if it is closer to zero, or if it is more negative.
This article deals with positive numbers, and is also applicable to negative numbers by taking the absolute value.
Small numbers are numbers that are small compared with the numbers used in everyday life. Very small numbers often occur in fields such as chemistry, electronics and quantum physics.

These algebraic ideas are closely related to topological ideas.  The group cohomology of a group G can be thought of as, and is motivated by, the singular cohomology of a suitable space having G as its fundamental group, namely the corresponding Eilenberg–MacLane space.  Thus, the group cohomology of Z can be thought of as the singular cohomology of the circle S1, and similarly for Z/2Z and P∞(R).
A great deal is known about the cohomology of groups, including interpretations of low-dimensional cohomology, functoriality, and how to change groups.  The subject of group cohomology began in the 1920s, matured in the late 1940s, and continues as an area of active research today.

Cathay is the Anglicized version of "Catai" and an alternative name for China in English.  It originates from the word Khitan ([tpl]zh|c=契丹[/tpl], Qìdān), the name of a nomadic people who founded the Liao Dynasty which ruled much of Northern China from 907 to 1125, and who later migrated west after they were overthrown by the Jurchens to form the Kara-Khitan Khanate centered on today's Kyrgyzstan for another century thereafter.
Originally, Catai was the name applied by Central and Western Asians and Europeans to  northern China; it obtained wide currency in Europe after the publication of Marco Polo's book (he referred to southern China as Manji). For centuries Cathay and China were believed by Europeans to be distinct nations with distinct cultures. However, by the late 1600s Europeans had mostly become aware that these were in fact the same nation.

[[Gluconeogenesis]]
CATEGORIES: Metabolism, Biochemistry, Metabolic pathways, Carbohydrates, Glycobiology, Exercise physiology, Hepatology, Diabetes

Gluconeogenesis (abbreviated GNG) is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glucogenic amino acids, and fatty acids (both even-chain[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?np10002|author=Glew, Robert H|title=You Can Get There From Here: Acetone, Anionic Ketones and Even-Carbon Fatty Acids can Provide Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|accessdate=August 2013[/tpl] and odd-chain).
It is one of the two main mechanisms humans and many other animals use to keep blood glucose levels from dropping too low (hypoglycemia). The other means of maintaining blood glucose levels is through the degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis).[tpl]cite web |last=Silva | first=Pedro  |title=The Chemical Logic Behind Gluconeogenesis | url=http://www2.ufp.pt/~pedros/bq/gng.htm | accessdate=September 8, 2009[/tpl]

In ruminants, this tends to be a continuous process.Young, J. W.  1977.  Gluconeogenesis in cattle: significance and methodology.  J. Dairy Sci. 60: 1-15.  In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise.  The process is highly exergonic until ATP or GTP are utilized, effectively making the process endergonic. For example, the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP. Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis. Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type II diabetes, such as metformin, which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hundal R, Krssak M, Dufour S, Laurent D, Lebon V, Chandramouli V, Inzucchi S, Schumann W, Petersen K, Landau B, Shulman G | title = Mechanism by Which Metformin Reduces Glucose Production in Type 2 Diabetes | journal = Diabetes | volume = 49 | issue = 12 | pages = 2063–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11118008 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.49.12.2063 | pmc = 2995498[/tpl] [tpl]PDFlink|Free full text|82 KiB[/tpl]  In ruminants, because metabolizable dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc.

Román Baldorioty de Castro[tpl]Spanish name|Baldorioty|de Castro[/tpl] (February 23, 1822 – September 30, 1889) is noted as one of Puerto Rico's foremost abolitionists and spokesman for the island's right to self-determination.  He received his primary and secondary education in San Juan. He received a scholarship and moved to Spain, where he continued his studies at the University of Madrid. In 1853, he returned to Puerto Rico and began working as a professor at the island's School of Commerce and the Seminario Concilar. Baldorioty de Castro was selected to represent Puerto Rico at the 1867 Universal Fair, which was organized in Paris, France. 
In 1870, he was elected as a deputy in the Cortes Generales, the Spanish parliament, where he promoted abolition of slavery. Baldorioty de Castro founded the Partido Autonomista in 1887, but he was only able to work within it for a few months. He was tried and imprisoned in Fort San Felipe del Morro, after being accused of publishing propaganda that affected the Spanish government's image. He was released after a brief period in jail, but his time in prison affected his health, which contributed to his death on September 30, 1889.

Department of the Vietnamese Language, School of Foreign Studies, University of International Business and Economics, Beijing, China. is a religious tradition, based on Buddhism, founded in 1939 by Huỳnh Phú Sổ, a native of the Mekong River Delta region of southern Vietnam. Adherents consider Sổ to be a prophet, and Hòa Hảo a continuation of a 19th-century Buddhist ministry known as Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương (Sino-Vietnamese [tpl]lang|zh|寶山奇香[/tpl]) "Strange Perfume from Precious Mountains", referring to the Bảy Núi range on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border. The founders of these traditions are regarded by Hòa Hảo followers as living Buddhas—destined to save mankind from suffering and to protect the Vietnamese nation. Hòa Hảo claims approximately two million followers throughout Vietnam; in some provinces near its Delta birthplace, as many as 90 percent of the population practice this tradition. An important characteristic of this movement is its emphasis on peasant farmers, exemplified by the old slogan, "Practicing Buddhism While Farming Your Land". Hòa Hảo stresses the practice of Buddhism by lay people in the home, rather than focusing primarily on temple worship and ordination. Aid to the poor is favored over pagoda-building or expensive rituals; religious and social ceremonies are ideally simple and modest, and are not to include the food offerings, divination services, and elaborate wedding and funeral customs found in some manifestations of Southeast Asian life. These are viewed as a waste of money which would be better spent helping the needy. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
In Hòa Hảo homes, a plain brown cloth serves as an altar, at which the family prays morning and night. Separate altars are used to honor ancestors and the sacred directions. Only fresh water, flowers, and incense are used in worship; no bells or gongs accompany prayers. A believer away from home at prayer times faces west (i.e., toward India) to pray to the Buddha. Adherents are expected to attend communal services on the 1st and 15th of each lunar month and on other Buddhist holy days. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]

Richard Bernard "Red" Skelton (July 18, 1913[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]September 17, 1997) was an American entertainer best known for being a national radio and television comedian between 1937 and 1971 and host of the long-running television program The Red Skelton Show. Skelton, who has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, began entertaining as a youngster. His show business career included a stint as a circus clown when he was in his teens.  Skelton continued on to vaudeville,  films, radio, TV, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist.
He learned his comedic and pantomime skills through experience, beginning at age 10 as part of a traveling medicine show.  Skelton then worked on a showboat as the era of that form of entertainment was waning.  He worked the burlesque circuit until its comedic standards began to change, coming into vaudeville as radio and films began to replace live entertainment. Skelton's lifestyle on the road meant having very little baggage, so he had few props to perform with.  He devised routines that required only a hat, which Skelton would fashion into appropriate shapes to suit his characters.  A pantomime sketch of how different people ate doughnuts written by Skelton and his wife opened the door for him in vaudeville, in radio and in films; it even opened the door of the Oval Office. He had long and successful careers in both radio and in films, but was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. Skelton's enthusiasm was rewarded with a twenty year career on network television with a regular program. Despite high ratings, his television show was canceled by CBS in 1970 as the network believed more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power.
While his first wife, comedy writer Edna Stillwell, provided the spark for Skelton the performer, it was his second wife, Georgia Davis, who convinced him that the art work he had done as a hobby for many years was worth sharing with the public. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.
Skelton believed his life's work was to make people laugh and wanted to be known as a clown, because he defined it as being able to do everything.  He entertained three generations of Americans during his career as a performer.  The earliest generation welcomed him to their cities and towns as a performer in various stage venues, the next into their homes on radio and television, while the younger generation was again able to welcome him personally, because Skelton focused his time and energy on personal appearance performances after he no longer had a regular television show.

[[Asymptotic equipartition property]]

CATEGORIES: Information theory, Statistical theorems

In information theory, the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) is a general property of the output samples of a stochastic source. It is fundamental to the concept of typical set used in theories of compression.
Roughly speaking, the theorem states that although there are many series of results that may be produced by a random process, the one actually produced is most probably from a loosely defined set of outcomes that all have approximately the same chance of being the one actually realized. (This is a consequence of the law of large numbers and ergodic theory.) Although there are individual outcomes which have a higher probability than any outcome in this set, the vast number of outcomes in the set almost guarantees that the outcome will come from the set. One way of intuitively understanding the property is through Cramér's large deviation theorem, which states that the probability of a large deviation from mean decays exponentially with the number of samples. Such results are studied in large deviations theory; intuitively, it is the large deviations that would violate equipartition, but these are unlikely.
In the field of pseudorandom number generation, a candidate generator of undetermined quality whose output sequence lies too far outside the typical set by some statistical criteria is rejected as insufficiently random. Thus, although the typical set is loosely defined, practical notions arise concerning sufficient typicality.

Fred Allen (born John Florence Sullivan; May 31, 1894 – March 17, 1956) was an American comedian whose absurdist, topically pointed radio show (1932–1949) made him one of the most popular and forward-looking humorists in the Golden Age of American radio.[tpl]cite news |work=New York Times|title=Fred Allen's Will Filed.

His best-remembered gag was his long-running mock feud with friend and fellow comedian Jack Benny, but it was only part of his appeal; radio historian John Dunning (in On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio) wrote that Allen was radio's most admired comedian and most frequently censored. A master ad libber, Allen often tangled with his network's executives (and often barbed them on the air over the battles), while developing routines whose style and substance influenced fellow comic talents, including Groucho Marx, Stan Freberg, Henry Morgan and Johnny Carson; his avowed fans also included President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and novelists William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and Herman Wouk (who began his career writing for Allen).

[[Typical set]]

CATEGORIES: Information theory, Probability theory

In information theory, the typical set is a set of sequences whose probability is close to two raised to the negative power of the entropy of their source distribution. That this set has total probability close to one is a consequence of the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) which is a kind of law of large numbers. The notion of typicality is only concerned with the probability of a sequence and not the actual sequence itself.
This has great use in compression theory as it provides a theoretical means for compressing data, allowing us to represent any sequence Xn using nH(X) bits on average, and, hence, justifying the use of entropy as a measure of information from a source.
The AEP can also be proven for a large class of stationary ergodic processes, allowing typical set to be defined in more general cases.

[[Great Tit]]

CATEGORIES: Parus, Birds of Asia, Birds of Europe, Animals described in 1758

[tpl]pp-semi-indef[/tpl][tpl]pp-pc1[/tpl]

The Great Tit (Parus major) is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common species throughout Europe, the Middle East, Central and Northern Asia, and parts of North Africa in any sort of woodland. It is generally resident, and most Great Tits do not migrate except in extremely harsh winters. Until 2005 this species was lumped with numerous other subspecies. DNA studies have shown these other subspecies to be distinctive from the Great Tit and these have now been separated as two separate species, the Cinereous Tit of southern Asia, and the Japanese Tit of East Asia. The Great Tit remains the most widespread species in the genus Parus.
The Great Tit is a distinctive bird, with a black head and neck, prominent white cheeks, olive upperparts and yellow underparts, with some variation amongst the numerous subspecies. It is predominantly insectivorous in the summer, but will consume a wider range of food items in the winter months, including small hibernating bats.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0611 |title=Great tits search for, capture, kill and eat hibernating bats |author=Péter Estók, Sándor Zsebők and Björn M. Siemers|year=2009|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|pages=59–62|pmid=19740892|issue=1|pmc=2817260[/tpl] Like all tits it is a cavity nester, usually nesting in a hole in a tree. The female lays around 12 eggs and incubates them alone, although both parents raise the chicks. In most years the pair will raise two broods. The nests may be raided by woodpeckers, squirrels and weasels and infested with fleas, and adults may be hunted by Sparrowhawks. The Great Tit has adapted well to human changes in the environment and is a common and familiar bird in urban parks and gardens. The Great Tit is also an important study species in ornithology.

The Battle of Hexham (15 May 1464) marked the end of significant Lancastrian resistance in the north of England during the early part of the reign of Edward IV.
The battle was fought near the town of Hexham in Northumberland. John Neville, later to be 1st Marquess of Montagu, led a modest force of 3,000-4,000 men, routed the rebel Lancastrians. Most of the rebel leaders were captured and executed, including Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, Robert Hungerford, 3rd Baron Hungerford and Philip Wentworth, Knight of Nettlestead, Suffolk. Henry VI, however, was kept safely away (having been captured in battle 3 times earlier in his life), and escaped to the north.
With their leadership gone, only a few castles remained in rebel hands. After these fell later in the year, Edward IV was not seriously challenged until the Earl of Warwick changed his allegiance from the Yorkist to the Lancastrian cause in 1469.

The Scottish Highland Football League (commonly known as the Highland League) is a football league, operating in the North of Scotland. It features teams not only from the Scottish Highlands, as the name may suggest, but also the north-east lowlands of Moray and Aberdeenshire. The league is a full member of the Scottish Football Association and is currently sponsored by the Aberdeen-based Press & Journal newspaper.
Historically, the league was one of the three senior leagues outwith the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League, along with the East of Scotland and South of Scotland Leagues. However, as part of the reorganisation of Scottish football during the 2012–13 season, it became a feeder division along with the newly formed Lowland Football League to the bottom tier of the merged Scottish Professional Football League.
It is intended that promotion and relegation will be instituted with the Scottish League Two via an annual play-off with the champions of the Lowland Football League, though this will not happen until at least the 2014–15 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22862971 |title=Scottish FA approves Lowland League for next season |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 June 2013[/tpl] Consequently, it will stand at a new Level 5 on the Scottish football pyramid, on a par with the Lowland League.

[[Philosophy of psychology]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy of mind, Philosophy of psychology, Philosophy of social science

Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example:
Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind, such as:
Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, for example questioning whether psychological phenomena can be explained using the methods of neuroscience, evolutionary theory, and computational modeling, respectively. Although these are all closely related fields, some concerns still arise about the appropriateness of importing their methods into psychology. Some such concerns are whether psychology, as the study of individuals as information processing systems (see Donald Broadbent), is autonomous from what happens in the brain (even if psychologists largely agree that the brain in some sense causes behavior (see supervenience)); whether the mind is "hard-wired" enough for evolutionary investigations to be fruitful; and whether computational models can do anything more than offer possible implementations of cognitive theories that tell us nothing about the mind (Fodor & Pylyshyn 1988).
Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field because "scientific" psychology—that is, psychology that favors experimental methods over introspection—came to dominate psychological studies only in the late 19th century. One of philosophy of psychology's concerns is to evaluate the merits of the many different schools of psychology that have been and are practiced. For example, cognitive psychology's use of internal mental states might be compared with behaviorism, and the reasons for the widespread rejection of behaviorism in the mid-20th century examined. 
Topics that fall within philosophy of mind, of course, go back much farther. For example, questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism have been discussed in philosophy for many centuries.
Related to philosophy of psychology are philosophical and epistemological inquiries about clinical psychiatry and psychopathology. Philosophy of psychiatry is mainly concerned with the role of values in psychiatry: derived from philosophical value theory and phenomenology, values-based practice is aimed at improving and humanizing clinical decision-making in the highly complex environment of mental health care.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Fulford KWM, Stanghellini G. |title=The Third Revolution: Philosophy into Practice in Twenty-first Century Psychiatry |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |year=2008 |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/fulford.htm[/tpl] Philosophy of psychopathology is mainly involved in the epistemological reflection about the implicit philosophical foundations of psychiatric classification and evidence-based psychiatry.

B News was a Usenet news server developed at the University of California, Berkeley by Matt Glickman and Mark Horton as a replacement for A News. It was used on Unix systems from 1981 into the 1990s and is the reference implementation for the de facto Usenet standard described in IETF RFC 850 and RFC 1036. Releases from 2.10.2 were maintained by UUNET founder Rick Adams.
B News introduced numerous changes from its predecessor.  Articles used an extensible format with named headers, first by using labeled equivalents to the A News format.  A further refinement in 1983 with News B2.10 was a move to e-mail-compatible headers, to ease message transfers with the ARPAnet.  A history database was introduced, allowing articles to be placed in separate directories by newsgroup, improving retrieval speeds and easing the development of separate newsreader programs such as rn. Support was provided for expiring old articles, and control messages (special articles that can automatically cause articles to be erased, or newsgroups to be added or removed) were added.
News B2.10 introduced the hierarchical article storage format carried into C News and InterNetNews, and still commonly seen in many newsreaders and cache programs. Before B2.10, all groups were stored beneath a single parent directory, impairing performance when the group list became large, and requiring that the first 14 characters be unique among all groups due to an old Unix limitation.  The hierarchical layout split the groups at the periods, reducing directory sizes and ameliorating the uniqueness problem.
B2.10 contained limited support for moderated newsgroups, with posters needing to manually mail in submissions to an intermediate party who would post articles on their behalf. Moderated groups needed to be prefixed with "mod." In 1986, version B2.11 allowed moderated newsgroups to appear in any hierarchy, and it transparently mailed out moderated group submissions using the normal posting software.
The last B News patch set was released in 1989, after which Rick Adams declared the product obsolete.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/software/b/faq/section-8.html |title=What is the release status of B News?

[[Algebraic variety]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic geometry, Algebraic varieties

In mathematics, algebraic varieties (also called varieties) are one of the central objects of study in algebraic geometry. Classically, an algebraic variety was defined to be the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations, over the real or complex numbers. Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion in several different ways, while attempting to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition.[tpl]r|Hartshorne|page1=58[/tpl]
Conventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ slightly. For example, some authors require that an "algebraic variety" is, by definition, irreducible (which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology), while others do not. When the former convention is used, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets.
The notion of variety is similar to that of manifold, the difference being that a variety may have singular points, while a manifold will not. In many languages, both varieties and manifolds are named by the same word.
Proven around the year 1800, the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one variable with complex coefficients (an algebraic object) is determined by the set of its roots (a geometric object). Generalizing this result, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of polynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence is the specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of geometry.

Herbert Spencer (27 April 1820 – 8 December 1903) was an English philosopher, biologist, anthropologist, sociologist, and prominent classical liberal political theorist of the Victorian era.
Spencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. He was "an enthusiastic exponent of evolution" and even "wrote about evolution before Darwin did."Riggenbach, Jeff (2011-04-24) The Real William Graham Sumner, Mises Institute As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, anthropology, economics, political theory, philosophy, literature, biology, sociology, and psychology. During his lifetime he achieved tremendous authority, mainly in English-speaking academia. "The only other English philosopher to have achieved anything like such widespread popularity was  Bertrand Russell, and that was in the 20th century."Richards, Peter (2010-11-04) Herbert Spencer: Social Darwinist or Libertarian Prophet?, Mises Institute Spencer was "the single most famous European intellectual in the closing decades of the nineteenth century"Thomas Eriksen and FinnNielsen, A history of anthropology (2001) p. 37"Spencer became the most famous philosopher of his time," says Henry L. Tischler, Introduction to Sociology (2010) p. 12 but his influence declined sharply after 1900; "Who now reads Spencer?" asked Talcott Parsons in 1937.Talcott Parsons, The Structure of Social Action (1937; New York: Free Press, 1968), p. 3; quoting from C. Crane Brinton, English Political Thought in the Nineteenth Century (London: Benn, 1933).
Spencer is best known for coining the expression "survival of the fittest", which he did in Principles of Biology (1864), after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5145#mark-5145.f3 |title=Letter 5145 – Darwin, C.

[[Theodolite]]

CATEGORIES: Geodesy, Inclinometers, Optical devices, Surveying instruments, Surveying

A theodolite [tpl]IPAc-en|θ|iː|ˈ|ɒ|d|ə|l|aɪ|t[/tpl] is a precision instrument for measuring angles in the horizontal and vertical planes. Theodolites are used mainly for surveying applications, and have been adapted for specialized purposes in fields like metrology and rocket launch technology. A modern theodolite consists of a movable telescope mounted within two perpendicular axes—the horizontal or trunnion axis, and the vertical axis. When the telescope is pointed at a target object, the angle of each of these axes can be measured with great precision, typically to seconds of arc.
Theodolites may be either transit or non-transit.
Transit theodolites (or just "transits") are those in which the telescope can be inverted in the vertical plane, whereas the rotation in the same plane is restricted to a semi-circle for non-transit theodolites. 
Some types of transit theodolites do not allow the measurement of vertical angles.
The builder's level is sometimes mistaken for a transit theodolite, but it measures neither horizontal nor vertical angles. It uses a spirit level to set a telescope level to define a line of sight along a level plane.

Crazy Eddie was an American retail business that sold electronic goods. The company did business in several forms. The first, and what would eventually become the most famous/infamous of the three, was a chain of retail stores that did business in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania as well as by phone. The second was a venture that initially began as a retail store but eventually was reorganized as an Internet and phone business. The third and most recent was an online and buy-by-phone store. As of 2013, none of the three Crazy Eddie ventures is conducting business.
Crazy Eddie was started in 1971 in Brooklyn, New York by businessmen Eddie and Sam M. Antar as ERS Electronics, named after Eddie, his cousin Ronnie (Ronnie Gindi, a partner), and his father Sam. The chain rose to prominence throughout the Tri-State Region as much for its prices as for its memorable radio and television commercials, featuring a frenetic, "crazy" character played by radio DJ Jerry Carroll (who copied most of his shtick from early TV-commercial pioneer, used car and electronics salesman Earl "Madman" Muntz). At its peak, Crazy Eddie had 43 stores in the chain, and earned more than $300 million in sales.[tpl]cite web|title=Only in New York (Part 2)|url=http://www.totalmedia.com/trivia_32.asp|accessdate=September 7, 2006[/tpl]
In February 1987, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey commenced a federal grand jury investigation into the warranty billing practices of Crazy Eddie.  In September of that year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation into alleged violations of federal securities laws by certain Crazy Eddie officers and employees. Eddie Antar was eventually charged with a series of crimes.
Unable to sustain his fraudulent business practices, co-founder Eddie Antar cashed in millions of dollars' worth of stock and resigned from the company in December 1986.  Crazy Eddie's board of directors lost control of the company in November 1987 after a proxy battle with a group led by Elias Zinn and Victor Palmieri, known as the Oppenheimer-Palmieri Group.  The entire Antar family was immediately removed from the business.  The new owners quickly discovered the true extent of the Antar family's fraud, but were unable to turn around Crazy Eddie's quickly declining fortunes.  In 1989, the company declared bankruptcy and was liquidated. Crazy Eddie became a known symbol for corporate fraud in its time, but has since been eclipsed by the Enron, Worldcom and Bernie Madoff accounting scandals.
Antar fled to Israel in February 1990, but was returned to the United States in January 1993 to stand trial.  His 1993 conviction on fraud charges was overturned, but he eventually pleaded guilty in 1996.  In 1997, Antar was sentenced to eight years in prison and paid large fines. He was released from prison in 1999.[tpl]cite web|title=Crazy Eddie' Antar's not so 'insane' view of the world|date=June 24, 2007|publisher=MarketWatch|author=Herb Greenberg|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/crazy-eddie-antars-not-so/story.aspx?guid=%7B5A237EB8-0D70-48F8-A861-E0EC37A409EB%7D[/tpl]

Our Lady of Fátima ([tpl]lang-pt|Nossa Senhora de Fátima[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈnɔsɐ sɨˈɲoɾɐ dɨ ˈfatimɐ|eu[/tpl]The Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation is [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈnɔsɐ sĩˈȷ̃ɔɾɐ dʒi ˈfatʃimɐ|[/tpl]) is the title based on purported apparitions to three shepherd children at Fátima, Portugal, on the thirteenth day of six consecutive months in 1917, beginning on May 13. The three children were Lúcia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto.
The apparition is also referred to as Our Lady of the Rosary (a term first used in 1208 for the reputed apparition in the church of Prouille), because the children said the apparition called herself the "Lady of the Rosary".  A combination of these titles is also seen, i.e. Our Lady of the Rosary of Fátima ([tpl]lang|pt|Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Fátima[/tpl]).
The events at Fátima gained fame due to elements of secrets, prophecy and eschatology, particularly with regard to World War II and possible world wars in the future. Chief among these is also the alleged urgent need for the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The reported apparitions at Fátima were officially declared "worthy of belief"  by the Catholic Church.

Paphlagonia ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|f|l|ə|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|n|i|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Παφλαγονία[/tpl]) was an ancient area on the Black Sea coast of north central Anatolia, situated between Bithynia to the west and Pontus to the east, and separated from Phrygia (later, Galatia) by a prolongation to the east of the Bithynian Olympus. According to Strabo, the river Parthenius formed the western limit of the region, and it was bounded on the east by the Halys river. 
The name Paphlagonia is derived in the legends from Paphlagon, a son of Phineus. (Eustath. ad Horn. II. ii. 851, ad Dion. Per. 787; Steph. B. t.v.; Const. Porph. de Them. i. 7.)

[[Kopspijkers]]
CATEGORIES: Satirical television programmes

Kopspijkers was a talk show that has been running on the Dutch public television from 1996 to 2005.  A recipient, in 2003, of the annual Zilveren Nipkow best-show award from Dutch television critics, the programme was produced by the left-of-centre public broadcaster VARA. It was hosted by [tpl]Ill|nl|Jack Spijkerman[/tpl], hence the title.
Humorous in style, the show was particularly noted for its satirical sketches. Until 2001 it was 'normal' cabaret, but in September 2001 (which happened to be the week of the 9/11 terrorist attacks) the show started with imitations of famous people. These were much like those featured in the British TV programme Spitting Image, but used real actors. Political leaders like Jan Peter Balkenende, Wouter Bos and Gerrit Zalm were frequently impersonated. At first only Dutch people were impersonated, later also foreign celebrities (including Tony Blair, Nelson Mandela, John Kerry and Viktor Yushchenko) were impersonated. In recent episodes even historical characters, like Napoleon Bonaparte, Anne Frank, Plato and Joseph Stalin were imitated. Kopspijkers was amongst the most viewed programmes in the Netherlands.
On several occasions, the imitations have caused controversies. The first imitation episode showed sensationalist TV presenter [tpl]Ill|nl|Willibrord Frequin[/tpl] chasing Osama Bin Laden asking "why he had been so cowardly" and "why he sent thousands of people into death". Pim Fortuyn was often imitated, which led to accusations against Kopspijkers after he was assassinated. In November 2003 Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende and Minister Piet Hein Donner complained about the 'tasteless' imitations of members of the Royal family. Queen Beatrix later said she had no problems with being imitated. In 2005, Jack Spijkerman decided to cancel his contract with VARA and sign with the newly formed channel Talpa. Though Spijkerman intended to finish the running season, VARA cut it short and cancelled the 4 remaining shows. Spijkerman made a similar (but commonly deemed of less quality) show on Talpa, called [tpl]Ill|nl|Koppensnellers[/tpl] but after bankruptcy of the channel it disappeared of the Dutch TV.
In 2004 similar shows were broadcast in Germany and Belgium, but they weren't very popular.

[[Per mil]]
CATEGORIES: Typographical symbols

A per mil, per mille, or per mill (permil or permille) (Latin, literally meaning 'for (every) thousand') is a tenth of a percent or one part per thousand. It is written with [tpl]unichar|2030|PER MILLE SIGN|html=[/tpl] (Windows: ALT+0137), which looks like a percent sign (%) with an extra zero at the end.  It can be seen as a stylized form of the three zeros in the denominator, although it originates from an alteration of the percent sign.
The term occurs so rarely in English that major dictionaries do not agree on the spelling or pronunciation (even within one dialect of English) and often do not list the other variants or do not even have an entry (for example Longman, and Macmillan).[ref]

The plot of 8-Bit Theater is loosely based on that of the video game Final Fantasy, in which four adventurers, the Light Warriors, must save the world by defeating four powerful demons that represent the four elements, thus relighting four magical orbs tied to the same elements, and, finally, defeating the personification of evil, Chaos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://adayinthemindof.wordpress.com/2008/08/28/8-bit-theater/|title=8-bit theater|last=Moore|first=Kyle E.|date=August 28, 2008|work=A Day in the Mind Of...|publisher=WordPress.com|accessdate=December 25, 2009[/tpl] However, while many of the original plot points and characters are present, the way they come about is often radically different. The Light Warriors themselves tend to cause far more harm than good on their travels and mostly have to be blackmailed, bribed, or threatened into accepting quests.
The comic is also not a serious epic; the protagonists and many of the supporting characters are based on and a parody of exaggerated role-playing video game stereotypes[tpl]cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/8-Bit+Theater|title=8-Bit Theater|last=Triune & Dialogue|date=September 24, 2001|publisher=Everything2|accessdate=December 25, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100206151229/http://everything2.com/title/8-Bit+Theater| archivedate= February 6, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] to the point where many characters are actually named after their character classes, and much of the humor displayed in 8-Bit Theater is derived from the ineptitude of characters[tpl]cite web|url=http://webcomicoverlook.com/2007/10/25/the-webcomic-overlook-17-8-bit-theater/|title=#17: 8-Bit Theater|last=El Santo|date=October 25, 2007|publisher=The Webcomic Overlook|accessdate=December 25, 2009[/tpl] as well as from the interactions between four protagonists who are travelling together but do not actually like each other very much. The range of comedic devices 8-Bit Theater employs includes droll humor, running gags, word play, and slapstick, and another significant portion of the humor results from creating reader anticipation for dramatic moments which fail to come. Clevinger has stated that "his favorite comics are the ones where the joke is on the reader."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.nuklearpower.com/2004/04/03/teaser/|title=Teaser!|last=Clevinger|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Clevinger|date=April 3, 2004|accessdate=December 24, 2009|accessdate=April 5, 2010[/tpl]
8-Bit Theater was originally intended to parody a variety of classic 8-bit video games, like Metroid or River City Ransom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nuklearforums.com/showpost.php?p=303169&postcount=10|title=What game should Brian spoof next?|author=Brian Clevinger (Kurosen) |publisher=Nuklear Power Forums|accessdate=December 24, 2009[/tpl] The popularity of the Final Fantasy comic convinced Clevinger to abandon this idea, although 8-Bit Theater does contain occasional references to other video games as well as comic books, television shows and movies, such as thinly veiled superhero parodies Arachna-Dude and The Sulk.

It was named after the village of Craigellachie on the River Spey in Moray, Scotland, the ancestral home of Sir George Stephen, the first president of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). At a critical time in the railway's development, Stephen travelled to Britain to raise desperately needed capital funding; when he succeeded, he telegraphed his associates in Canada quoting the familiar motto of Clan Grant: "Stand fast, Craigellachie!"
The Canadian Craigellachie is most famous for being the site of the "Last Spike" of the CPR, driven by Sir Donald Smith, a director of the CPR, on November 7, 1885.In fact, Sir Donald drove in two spikes; his first attempt resulted in a bent spike and so the Last Spike was  a replacement.

Software development  is the computer programming, documenting, and testing involved in creating and maintaining applications and frameworks involved in a software release life cycle and resulting in a software product. The term refers to a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bestpricecomputers.co.uk/glossary/application-development.htm |title=Application Development (AppDev) Defined and Explained |publisher=Bestpricecomputers.co.uk |date=2007-08-13 |accessdate=2012-08-05[/tpl] Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.[tpl]cite web|author=DRM Associates|title=New Product Development Glossary |url=http://www.npd-solutions.com/glossary.html |year=2002|accessdate=2006-10-29[/tpl]
Software can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being to meet specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with custom software), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential users (the case with commercial and open source software), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist may write software to automate a mundane task). Embedded software development, that is, the development of embedded software such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the development process to be integrated with the development of the controlled physical product.
The need for better quality control of the software development process has given rise to the discipline of software engineering, which aims to apply the systematic approach  exemplified in the engineering paradigm to the process of software development.

[[Section sign]]

CATEGORIES: Typographical symbols, Punctuation

The section sign (Unicode [tpl]unichar|00A7|Section sign[/tpl], HTML &sect;, TeX \S) is a typographical character used mainly to refer to a particular section of a document, such as a legal code.[tpl]cite web | title = Legal Research and Citation Style in USA, by Ronald M. Standler | url = http://www.rbs0.com/lawcite.htm#anchor333333 | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-12-15[/tpl] It is also called "double S", "hurricane", and "sectional symbol".
The likely origin of the section sign is the digraph formed by the combination of two S glyphs (from the Latin signum sectiōnis).
When duplicated, as §§, it is read as the plural "sections" (e.g. "§§ 13–21"), much as "pp." (pages) is the plural of "p.".
It is frequently used along with the pilcrow (¶), or paragraph sign. 
Like the dagger (†) and double dagger (‡), it is also sometimes used to link to a footnote where the asterisk (*) is already in use on a given page; however, these usages are declining[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] in favor of numbered footnotes, usually put in superscript or square brackets.

CATEGORIES: Meteorite mineralogy and petrology, Meteorite minerals, Interstellar media, Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic dust

Presolar grains are interstellar solid matter originating at a time before the Sun was formed (presolar: before the Sun).
Presolar stardust grains formed within outflowing and cooling gases from earlier (pre-Sol) stars. The stellar nucleosynthesis that took place within the presolar star gave the grains an isotopic composition unique to that star, which differs from the isotopic composition of our solar system's matter as well as from the galactic average. These isotopic signatures often fingerprint very specific astrophysical nuclear processesErnst Zinner (1998) Stellar nucleosynthesis and the isotopic composition of presolar grains from primitive meteorites, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences 26:147-188. that took place within the parent star and prove their extra-Sol origin.T.

The Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg ([tpl]lang-de|Herzogtum Braunschweig-Lüneburg[/tpl]), or more properly Duchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg, was an historical ducal state from the late Middle Ages until the late Early Modern era within the North-Western domains of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, in what is now northern Germany. The dukedom emerged in 1235 from the allodial lands of the House of Welf in Saxony and was granted as an imperial fief to Otto the Child, a grandson of Henry the Lion. Its name came from the two largest towns in the territory: Brunswick and Lüneburg. The duchy was divided several times during the High Middle Ages amongst various lines of the House of Welf, but the rulers all continued to be styled as the "Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg" in addition to their particular title as "Prince of Lüneburg" or "Prince of Wolfenbüttel", etc. The individual principalities making up the duchy continued to exist until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1814/15, the territories became part of the Kingdom of Hanover and Duchy of Brunswick.

Sharman Douglas (October 5, 1928 – February 3, 1996) was an American socialite known for her friendship with the British royal family, in particular Princess Margaret.
She was the only daughter of chemicals heiress and philanthropist Peggy Zinsser (d. 1992) and politician Lewis W. Douglas (d. 1974) who served as Arizona congressman, director of the Bureau of the Budget from 1933 until 1934, and U. S. ambassador to the Court of St. James's from 1947 until 1950.  It was during these three years in England that she developed her friendship with Princess Margaret and the royal family.
At various times in her life, "Charmin' Sharman," as she was known during her father's tenure as ambassador, worked as a talent agent, a movie publicist, and a public-relations agent.  In 1966, New York City mayor John Lindsay named her New York's Commissioner of Public Events.
Linked romantically to the Marquess of Blandford and the Marquess of Milford Haven in the 1950s, she also reportedly had a two-year relationship with the United Kingdom's Princess Margaret, according to "Margaret: The Secret Princess," an ITV program broadcast in Britain in February 2003.
Sharman Douglas married Andrew MacKenzie Hay, a food importer, in 1968. They divorced in 1977.
Her first cousin Josalee Douglas was the first wife of Count Jean-François de Chambrun, who later married Raine, Countess Spencer, the former stepmother of Diana, Princess of Wales.
Sharman Douglas died of bone cancer at New York Hospital in 1996.

The [tpl]nihongo|Kenmu (or Kemmu) Restoration|建武の新政|Kenmu no shinsei[/tpl] (1333–1336) is the name given to both the three-year period of Japanese history between the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period, and the political events that took place in it.Spelling note: A modified Hepburn romanization system for Japanese words is used throughout Western publications in a range of languages including English.  Unlike the standard system, it maintains the "n" even when it's followed by "homorganic consonants" (e.g., shinbun, not shimbun). The restoration was an effort made by Emperor Go-Daigo to bring the Imperial House and the nobility it represented back into power, thus restoring a civilian government after almost a century and a half of military rule.Sansom 1977: 22-42. The attempted restoration ultimately failed and was replaced by the Ashikaga shogunate (1336–1575). This was to be the last time the Emperor had any power until the Meiji restoration of 1867. The many and serious political errors made by the Imperial House during this three-year period were to have important repercussions in the following decades and end with the rise to power of the Ashikaga dynasty.

[[The Hee Bee Gee Bees]]
CATEGORIES: English pop music groups, Parodies, Parody musicians

The Hee Bee Gee Bees were a pop group formed initially to parody the Bee Gees towards the close of their sequence of high-pitched, disco-style hits. The 'band' consisted of the three Cribb (Gibb) brothers; Garry (Barry), Norris (Maurice) and Dobbin (Robin), performed respectively by Angus Deayton, Michael Fenton Stevens, and Philip Pope. The name of group was a reference to both the Bee Gees and the expression "heebie-jeebies".
Their first single "Meaningless Songs (in Very High Voices)", written by Pope and Richard Curtis, was released by Original Records in 1980 and reached number two in the Australian singles chart. They failed to have any Top 40 hits in the UK however, and are therefore unmentioned in the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles.[tpl]cite book|year=1999|isbn=0-85112-092-X|title=Guinness Book of British Hit Singles|publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd|edition=12th[/tpl]
Two albums were subsequently released under the Hee Bee Gee Bees name, featuring parodies of various pop groups that had originally been featured in the Radio Active radio series, where all three of the comedians were cast members. Tracks included parodies of Supertramp ("Scatological Song" by Supertrash), Michael Jackson ("Up the Wall" by Jack Michaelson), Status Quo ("Boring Song" by Status Quid), The Police ("Too Depressed to Commit Suicide" by The PeeCees), David Bowie ("Quite Ahead of My Time" by David Bowwow), Gary Numan ("Are Trains Electric?" by Gary Inhuman) and others. The albums were recorded in the Strawberry Studios in Stockport, and featured 10cc and Sad Café studio musicians. The music was written by Pope, with lyrics by Deayton and other Radio Active scriptwriters.
Fenton-Stevens was also a cast member on Spitting Image and later sang lead on their UK number one hit, "The Chicken Song", also co-written and produced by Pope.

Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/the-fia/about-fia/Pages/AboutFIA.aspx |title=About FIA |publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) |accessdate=31 October 2008 [/tpl] The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform. The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The results of each race are combined to determine two annual Championships, one for drivers and one for constructors.
The first World Championship Grand Prix was held in [tpl]F1|1950[/tpl] at Silverstone; since then 69 circuits have hosted a Grand Prix. Circuits such as the Nürburgring have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations. The first race at the Nürburgring used the [tpl]convert|22.835|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.[tpl]harvnb|Hughes|Tremayne|2002|p=76[/tpl] F1 circuits were predominately in Europe during the early years of the championship, as the sport has expanded so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in [tpl]F1|2012[/tpl], nearly half were not on the calendar before [tpl]F1|1999[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/formula-1/news/22058/7283408/A-truly-global-sport |title=A truly global sport |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2012 |first=Pete |last=Gill [/tpl]
The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most Grands Prix; it has been used as the circuit for the Italian Grand Prix 63 times. The only season it did not host a race was in [tpl]F1|1980[/tpl], when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2006/9/4900.html |title=Facts and figures – Italian Grand Prix |publisher=Formula 1 |date=7 September 2006 |accessdate=22 June 2012 [/tpl] The Circuit of the Americas became the 69th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the United States Grand Prix in 2012. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix. The [tpl]convert|25.800|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race; in [tpl]F1|1957[/tpl] it was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.espnf1.com/italy/motorsport/circuit/1273.html |title=Pescara Circuit |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=18 June 2012 [/tpl]

[[Inverted question and exclamation marks]]
CATEGORIES: Spanish language, Punctuation, Interrogative words and phrases

Inverted question (¿) and exclamation marks (¡) are punctuation marks used to begin interrogative and exclamatory sentences (or clauses), respectively, in written Spanish and sometimes also in languages which have cultural ties with Spanish, such as in older standards of Galician (now it is optional and not recommended) or Catalan. They can also be combined in several ways to express the combination of a question and surprise or disbelief. The initial marks are normally mirrored at the end of the sentence or clause by the common marks (?, !) used in most other languages. Unlike the ending marks, which are fully above the line in a sentence, the (¿) and (¡) are placed about halfway below the line.
Inverted marks were originally recommended by the Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy) in 1754, and adopted gradually over the next century.
On computers, inverted marks are supported by various standards, including ISO-8859-1, Unicode, and HTML. They can be entered directly on keyboards designed for Spanish-speaking countries, or via alternative methods on other keyboards.

[[The Remarkables]]

The Remarkables are a mountain range and skifield in Otago, South Island of New Zealand. Located on the southeastern shore of Lake Wakatipu, the range lives up to its name by rising sharply to create an impressive backdrop for the waters. The range is clearly visible from the nearby town of Queenstown.
The highest point in the range is Double Cone (2319 metres) with Ben Nevis (2234 metres, named after the Scottish mountain of the same name) further south in the Hector mountains.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl] 
There are a number of small lakes on the mountains including Lake Alta which forms part of the Remarkables Skifield.
The mountains were named The Remarkables by Alexander Garvie in 1857-58,Miller. F.W.G. (1949) Golden Days of Lake County. Whitcomb and Toombs. Pg 352. allegedly  because they are one of only two mountain ranges in the world which run directly north to south.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl] An alternate explanation for the name given by locals is that early Queenstown settlers, upon seeing the mountain range during sunset one evening, named them the Remarkables to describe the sight.

[[Ï]]

CATEGORIES: Specific letter-diacritic combinations

[tpl]unicode|Ï[/tpl], lowercase [tpl]unicode|ï[/tpl], is a symbol used in various languages written with the Latin alphabet; it can be read as the letter I with diaeresis or I-umlaut.
In Afrikaans, Catalan, Dutch, French, Galician, Welsh, Southern Sami, and occasionally English, [tpl]angle bracket|ï[/tpl] is used when [tpl]angle bracket|i[/tpl] follows another vowel and indicates hiatus (diaeresis) in the pronunciation of such a word—that is, it indicates that the two vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, rather than together as a diphthong or digraph. For example, French maïs ([tpl]IPA-fr|ma.is|IPA[/tpl], maize); without the diaeresis, the [tpl]angle bracket|i[/tpl] is part of the digraph [tpl]angle bracket|ai[/tpl]: mais ([tpl]IPA-fr|mɛ|IPA[/tpl], but). The letter is also in Dutch Oekraïne ([tpl]IPA-af|ukrɑːˈinə|IPA[/tpl], Ukraine), and English naïve ([tpl]IPAc-en|n|ɑː|ˈ|iː|v[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|n|aɪ|ˈ|iː|v[/tpl]).
In scholarly writing on Turkish, [tpl]angbr|ï[/tpl] is sometimes used to write the close back unrounded vowel [tpl]IPA|/ɯ/[/tpl], which in standard modern Turkish orthography is written as the dotless i [tpl]angbr|ı[/tpl].
In the transcription of the languages of the Amazon, ï is used to represent the high central vowel [tpl]IPAblink|ɨ[/tpl].

[[Ñ]]

CATEGORIES: Specific letter-diacritic combinations, Phonetic transcription symbols, Spanish language, Breton language

Ñ (lower case ñ, International Phonetic Alphabet: [tpl]IPA|/ˈeɲe/[/tpl] "énye")  is a letter of the modern Latin alphabet, formed by an N with a diacritical tilde.  It is used in the Spanish alphabet, Galician alphabet, Asturian alphabet, Basque alphabet, Aragonese old alphabet (Grafía de Uesca de 1987), Filipino alphabet, Chamorro alphabet, Guarani alphabet, Mapudungun alphabet, Mandinka alphabet and in Latin transliteration of Tocharian, where it represents [tpl]IPAblink|ɲ[/tpl]. It represents [tpl]IPAblink|ŋ[/tpl] in Crimean Tatar, and in the Rohingya languages it denotes nasalization of the preceding vowel.
Unlike many other alphabets that use diacritic marks (such as ü in Asturian, Leonese, Spanish, and Galician), Ñ is considered by these languages a letter in its own right, with its own name (eñe, pronounced "enye") and its own place in the alphabet (after N). From this point of view, its alphabetical independence is similar to the English W (which historically came from a doubled V just as Ñ came from a doubled N).

CATEGORIES: Living people, Board game designers, 1957 births

Reiner Knizia ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈʁaɪnɐ ˈknɪtsiə[/tpl]) is a prolific German-style board game designer. Born in Germany, he developed his first game at the age of eight. He has a PhD in mathematics, and has been a full-time game designer since 1997, when he quit his job from the board of a large international bank. Knizia has been living in England since 1993.
In addition to having designed over 500 published games, Knizia is highly acclaimed as a designer, having won the Deutscher Spiele Preis four times, a Spiel des Jahres (in addition to a Kinderspiel des Jahres and a special award), and numerous other national and international awards. At the Origins Game Fair in 2002 he was inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame. His games frequently make appearances on various "top games" lists, including the GAMES 100 list, the BoardGameGeek top 100, and the Internet Top 100 Games List. Several gaming conventions host "Kniziathons", which are tournaments dedicated to celebrating Knizia-designed games.[tpl]cite web|title= Reiner Knizia Kniziathon|url=http://www.convivium.org.uk/kgkniziathon.htm|accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]
Reiner Knizia started developing games for his play-by-mail game zine Postspillion, founded in 1985. The zine still exists, and the game Bretton Woods (also a Reiner Knizia design), which was started in 1987, is still going.
One of Knizia's best selling games is Lord of the Rings, published in 17 languages with over one million copies sold. His dice game Pickomino has also reached 1 million copies sold and his Keltis sold over 600,000 copies. His game Ingenious has been published in over 20 languages. In 2011, Knizia designed a Star Trek-themed game for NECA/WizKids, based on the 2009 film that 'reset' the Star Trek universe.[tpl]cite web|title=Coming Soon - Star Trek Expeditions!|url=http://wizkidsgames.com/startrek/star-trek-expeditions/|publisher=NECA/WizKids|accessdate=6 April 2011[/tpl]
A number of Knizia designs have been redeveloped for the electronic gaming & console markets. Ingenious (aka Einfach Genial) and Keltis have both appeared in CD-ROM versions; Lost Cities was adapted for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. An original game for the Nintendo DS, Dr. Reiner Knizia's Brainbenders was published in 2008; Keltis for the NDS followed in 2009.

[[Little Wonder Records]]

CATEGORIES: American record labels, Record labels established in 1914, Record labels disestablished in 1923

Little Wonder Records was a United States record label from 1914 through 1923.
Little Wonders were manufactured by the Columbia Phonograph Company, and were distributed exclusively by Henry Waterson (the business partner of Irving Berlin) in their early years (1914-1916) -- an arrangement that has only recently been discovered as the original contract stipulated that both parties were to keep this relationship a secret. Artists are generally uncredited on Little Wonder labels, which simply give recordings such general attributions as "band", "tenor", "quartette", or "accordion solo".
Little Wonders were lateral-cut single sided 5½ inch gramophone records. The records contained only about 1½ to 2 minutes of music. The small size of the discs (together with the cherubic face on later versions of the label) has led some record collectors to incorrectly assume that Little Wonders were made as children's records; they were actually made for the general audience looking for low-priced recordings.
The records retailed for ten cents each, some of the lowest priced recordings available at the time. This price point revolutionized popular recorded music, making it possible for everyday people to purchase and listen to music other than live performances. The audio fidelity is average to slightly above average for the time, with rather narrow grooves (best played with a smaller stylus than contemporary discs). Millions and millions of these records were sold, principally through many 5 & 10 cent department store chains of the time and through Sears & Roebuck catalogs.
 Image:LittleWonderBlueGoose.jpg 
There is some controversy about whether Little Wonders were made by artists who recorded for Columbia. One account says that recording artists would visit the Little Wonder recording studio on one floor of the Woolworth Building before or after making records at the Columbia studio on a higher floor of the same building. And there has been some speculation that the masters for Little Wonders were actually warm-up balance checks recorded as tests at the beginning of Columbia recording sessions; if such tests happened to record a usable performance, they would be leased to Little Wonder. However, court papers from an early lawsuit between Waterson and Victor Emerson indicate that performers were paid separately and specifically to record for Little Wonder records.
Among the noted artists of the day whose performances were released (uncredited) on Little Wonder include Al Jolson, Gene Greene, Wilbur Sweatman, Billy Murray, Vernon Dalhart and the Louisiana Five.
Little Wonder # 339, "The Camp Meeting Jubilee" by a male vocal "quartette", issued in 1916, contains the lyrics  "We've been rockin' an' rolling in your arms / Rockin' and rolling in your arms / In the arms of Moses."  This is believed to be the first use in an audio recording of the phrase "rock.. and roll..", albeit in the context of a religious spiritual rather than its later secular use.

Victor August Herbert (February 1, 1859 – May 26, 1924) was an Irish-born, German-raised American composer, cellist and conductor.  Although Herbert enjoyed important careers as a cello soloist and conductor, he is best known for composing many successful operettas that premiered on Broadway from the 1890s to World War I.  He was also prominent among the tin pan alley composers and was later a founder of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP).  A prolific composer, Herbert produced two operas, a cantata, 43 operettas, incidental music to 10 plays, 31 compositions for orchestra, nine band compositions, nine cello compositions, five violin compositions with piano or orchestra, 22 piano compositions and numerous songs, choral compositions and orchestrations of works by other composers, among other music.
In the early 1880s, Herbert began a career as a cellist in Vienna, Austria, and Stuttgart, Germany, during which he began to compose orchestral music.  Herbert and his opera singer wife, Therese Förster, moved to the U.S. in 1886 when both were engaged by the Metropolitan Opera.  In the U.S., Herbert continued his performing career, while also teaching at the National Conservatory of Music, conducting and composing.  His most notable instrumental compositions were his Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30 (1894), which entered the standard repertoire,"Sullivan's only concerto a classic", The Los Angeles Daily News, March 13, 1987, reprinted at julianlloydwebber.com and his Auditorium Festival March (1901).  He led the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1898 to 1904 and then founded the Victor Herbert Orchestra, which he conducted throughout the rest of his life.
Herbert began to compose operettas in 1894, producing several successes, including The Serenade (1897) and The Fortune Teller (1898).  Even more successful were some of the operettas that he wrote after the turn of the 20th century: Babes in Toyland (1903), Mlle. Modiste (1905), The Red Mill (1906), Naughty Marietta (1910), Sweethearts (1913) and Eileen (1917).  After World War I, with the change of popular musical tastes, Herbert began to compose musicals and contributed music to other composers' shows.  While some of these were well-received, he never again achieved the level of success that he had enjoyed with his most popular operettas.

Joseph Franklin Rutherford (November 8, 1869 – January 8, 1942), also known as "Judge" Rutherford, was the second president of the incorporated Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.  He played a primary role in the organization and doctrinal development of Jehovah's Witnesses,Leo P. Chall, Sociological Abstracts, vol 26 issues 1–3, "Sociology of Religion", 1978, p. 193 col 2: "Rutherford, through the Watch Tower Society, succeeded in changing all aspects of the sect from 1919 to 1932 and created Jehovah's Witnesses—a charismatic offshoot of the Bible student community.""The Embryonic State of a Religious Sect's Development: The Jehovah's Witnesses" Sociological Yearbook of Religion in Britain, ed. Michael Hill, 1972, issue 5 pp 11–12: "Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded to Russell's position as President of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society, but only at the expense of antagonizing a large proportion of the Watch Towers subscribers. Nevertheless, he persisted in moulding the Society to suit his own programme of activist evangelism under systematic central control, and he succeeded in creating the administrative structure of the present-day sect of Jehovah's Witnesses."The Twentieth century, vol 153, 1953 p. 14: "This latter phenomenon, perhaps the most widely spread politico-religious movement at the present time, is linked, as are so many, with a source in America, in this case Judge Rutherford, the New York founder of Jehovah's Witnesses." which emerged from the Bible Student movement established by Charles Taze Russell.
Rutherford began a career in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He developed an interest in the doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement and was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers.
