Allmusic journalist, Bradley Torreano states "Ray Martin created a legacy for himself in British popular music through his work with his orchestra during the 1950s. His regular appearances on radio and television kept him in the public spotlight, while his position at EMI Records made him an influential producer at the label. His use of pseudonyms has blurred the path of his career through the years, making his many contributions even harder to keep track of. But his original compositions are what really made him popular; tracks like "Marching Strings" have become stables of many public and city bands and orchestras since their release".[tpl]cite web |first= |last= |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p25285/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Biography by Bradley Torreano |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=25 February 2009[/tpl]

Kemusuk is a village in the Argo Mulya area in the Sedayu subdistrict, Bantul Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The village, around 10km to the west of Yogyakarta towards the town of Wates, is known as the birthplace of former president Suharto.  Suharto was born to a 'poor but not unimportant farmer's family' in the village.  His father, Kertosudiro, was a local irrigation official in charge of overseeing the allocation of water to different farmers in Kemusuk. His mother, Sukirah, was a village woman from a nearby hamlet.Soeharto: The demise of a master', The Jakarta Post, 28 January 2008. 
The Suharto family have returned to the village on various occasions in recent years. Suharto himself, accompanied by members of his family, made a trip to Kemusuk in 2002 to pay respects at his father's grave.  At the time Suharto's younger step-brother, Notosuwito, had a house in the village near the graveyard in the Kepoh area.Sri Wahyuni, 'Ailing Soeharto visits graves of parents, meets son', The Jakarta Post, 30 October 2002.

Patricia "Pan" Godchaux is a moderate Republican who ran for the United States Congress for the 9th federal congressional district in the state of Michigan.  She challenged seven-term incumbent Joe Knollenberg in the Republican primary and hoped to get Democratic support in the primary, as the Democrats' challenger, Nancy Skinner, didn't have to face a primary contest. She notes that the district leans Republican, and that unless citizens of the district want to re-elect a conservative Republican, their best chance to avoid doing so was by placing a moderate one on the ballot in November.  Ultimately Gochaux failed in her attempt to unseat the seven-term incumbent, garnering 30% of the vote to Knollenberg's 70%, or 20,211 to 46,713 votes.News From The Associated Press 
Godchaux previously served on the Birmingham, Michigan school board and the Michigan House of Representatives.  She is a member of Triangle Foundation's Board of Advisors.Triangle Foundation

[[Wunder gibt es immer wieder]]
CATEGORIES: Eurovision songs of Germany, Eurovision songs of 1970

Wunder gibt es immer wieder (English translation: "Miracles Keep Happening Again And Again") was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970, performed in German by Katja Ebstein.
The song was performed eleventh on the night (following Monaco's Dominique Dussault with "Marlène" and preceding Ireland's Dana with "All Kinds of Everything"). At the close of voting, it had received 12 points, placing 3rd in a field of 12.
The song is a positive one, with a slow yet happy melody reminiscent of Janis Joplin. Ebstein comments that there is no point in complaining that one is unhappy or loveless, because miracles constantly happen and one will eventually happen to everyone. Ebstein also recorded the song in English (as "No More Love for Me"), French ("Un miracle peut arriver"), Spanish ("Siempre hay algún milagro"), Italian ("Nella strada del mio cuore") and Japanese ("Ai no otozure").
It was covered by Guildo Horn and later by Monrose for the Deutscher Vorentscheid 2007.

Baron Haversham is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Both creations are extinct. The first creation came on 4 May 1696, when Sir John Thompson, 1st Baronet was created Baron Haversham, of Haversham in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of England. He had formerly been Member of Parliament for Gatton and had already been created a Baronet, of Haversham in the County of Buckingham, in the Baronetage of England in 1673. His son, the second Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Bletchingley and Gatton, before inheriting the title. He had no sons and the barony became extinct on his death on 11 April 1745.
The second creation came on 11 January 1906, when the Liberal politician Sir Arthur Hayter, 2nd Baronet, was created Baron Haversham, of Bracknell in the County of Berkshire, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was the only son of the Whig politician William Goodenough Hayter, best remembered for his two tenures as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury in the 1850s, who was created a Baronet, of South Hill Park in the County of Berkshire, on 19 April 1858. Lord Haversham was childless and both the barony and baronetcy became extinct on his death on 10 May 1917.

[[Bozhentsi]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in Gabrovo Province, Tourism in Bulgaria, 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria

Bozhentsi ([tpl]lang-bg|Боженци[/tpl]; also variously transliterated as Bozhenci, Bojenci, Bojenzi, Boženci, Bojentsi, Bojentzi, Bozhentzi, etc.), officially but not commonly Bozhentsite (Боженците), is a village and architectural reserve in Gabrovo municipality, Gabrovo Province, in central northern Bulgaria. The village lies in the middle part of the Balkan Mountains, 15 km east of Gabrovo and just north of the Shipka Pass. It is noted for its well-preserved Bulgarian National Revival architecture and history, and is thus a well-known tourist destination in the area.
Bozhensti was established after the incursion of Ottoman Turks in Veliko Tarnovo, the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, in the 16th century. Many residents of the capital then fled to settle in remote and secure parts of the mountains. According to the legend, among them was the young female noble (bolyarka) Bozhana, who chose to hide in the area where the village today is, and gave it its name. The noble's sons engaged in trade and the village gradually grew to become an important trade junction during the National Revival towards the middle of the 18th century. The main production consisted of leather, wool, beeswax and honey.
The village of Bozhentsi was proclaimed an architectural and historical reserve in 1964 and is part of UNESCO's cultural monuments. The National Revival architecture has been preserved in Bozhentsi due to this, and there is a ban on the construction of any buildings that do not fit with the village's style.
As the settlers during the Ottoman rule were mostly wealthy people, many of the houses have two storeys, the first being used as a cattle-shed and the second being inhabited by the owners. Characteristic features of the Bozhentsi architecture are the verandas, the stone-plate roofs, the corner fireplaces and the ceiling woodcarvings. The pavement of the streets in the village is only cobblestone.
The Prophet Elijah basilica, featuring a nave and two aisles, is a remarkable example of the National Revival style. Domes can be seen hidden under the ceiling, as well as massive stone walls and the typical Bozhentsi arches. The church was erected in 1835, and the village's influential residents were allowed to construct a belfry, which was usually strictly forbidden by the Ottoman authorities.
The former class school was constructed in 1872 and was situated in an imposing building near the entrance to the village. It is today a gallery and its first storey would once accommodate a hall and a library, with the classrooms being located on the second storey.
A Roman bridge lies east of the village and a forest path leading to Tryavna begins on the other side.

The two grew up together in the deep woods of Bangalla, where Guran taught the Phantom the ways of the Bandar tribe. Guran was the Phantom's best man when he married his girlfriend since boyhood, Diana Palmer. Guran followed Kit to Clarksdale, Mississippi, where Kit studied while living with his aunt and uncle, Bessie and Sid, leaving him to become the first of the shy, isolated Bandar pigmies to learn how to read and write. He also brought Kit the message about Kit's dying father, the 20th Phantom, causing the 20-year-old college student to leave America to return to the Skull Cave, Bangalla, where he took up the mantle of the Phantom. Known for his characteristic clothing, he is usually seen wearing a special hat made of either blades of grass or wood. He is also the medicine man of the Bandar, and has saved the Phantom's life on a few occasions due to his knowledge of ancient Bangallan medicine, as well as modern western medicine.

The 'Order' of Ethiopia lamaTopiya was an African religious group from the Methodists Church who originates from the  Ethiopian movement started by 18th century African Theologians such as Revds. Tiyo Soga,Nehemiah Tile,Mzimba,Mangena Mokoena,Mata Dwane and others. After trying to associate themselves with the African Methodist Episcopal AMEChurch in search of establishing an authentic African Church, they ended up forming relations with the Church of the Province of Southern Africa, It was founded and initially led by James Mata Dwane. James Mata Dwane left the A.M.E church as he did not feel his episcopal status was valid, and thus along with the likes of m. mpumlwane and nehemiya tile left the church. They sought talks with the Church of the Province and in 1900 a compact was signed by the seven bishops of the province to be in communion with the Ethiopian church. This involved a decision to consecrate bishops, priest and deacons for the Order. James Mata Dwane was made a deaconin 1900,ordained as a Priest in 1911 and he died in 1916 as a Provincial of the Order of Ethiopia a Presidential title equal to that of an Anglican Bishop.

[[Departure function]]
CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics, Fluid mechanics, Equations

In thermodynamics, a departure function is defined for any thermodynamic property as the difference between the property as computed for an ideal gas and the property of the species as it exists in the real world, for a specified temperature T and pressure P.  Common departure functions include those for enthalpy, entropy, and internal energy.
Departure functions are used to calculate real fluid extensive properties (i.e. properties which are computed as a difference between two states).  A departure function gives the difference between the real state, at a finite volume or non-zero pressure and temperature, and the ideal state, usually at zero pressure or infinite volume and temperature.
For example, to evaluate enthalpy change between two points h(v1,T1) and h(v2,T2) we first compute the enthalpy departure function between the v1 and infinite volume at T=T1, then add to that the ideal gas enthalpy change due to the temperature change from T1 to T2, then subtract the departure function value between v2 and infinite volume.
Departure functions are computed by integrating a function which depends on an equation of state and its derivative.

[tpl]Gluck operas[/tpl]Le cinesi (The Chinese Women) is an opera in one act, with music composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck.  The Italian-language libretto was by Pietro Metastasio, and he described it as a componimento drammatico. This libretto had first been set by Antonio Caldara in 1735.  For Gluck's rework, the piece is often considered as an azione teatrale, even though Metastasio and the composer both retained the original designation. The work was first performed for the Austrian royal family at the Vienna Schlosshof on 24 September 1754, on the occasion of the visit of the Empress Maria Theresa to the household of Saxe-Hildburghausen.Howard, Patricia, "Music in London: Opera - Le cinesi" (September 1984).

The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives is one of the major works of Zbigniew Brzezinski. Brzezinski graduated with a PhD from Harvard University in 1953 and became Professor of American Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University before becoming the United States National Security Advisor during 1977－1981 under the administration of President Jimmy Carter.
Regarding the landmass of Eurasia as the center of global power, Brzezinski sets out to formulate a Eurasian geostrategy for the United States.  In particular, he writes, it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger should emerge capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America's global pre-eminence.
Much of his analysis is concerned with geostrategy in Central Asia, focusing on the exercise of power on the Eurasian landmass in a post-Soviet environment. In his chapter dedicated to what he refers to as the "Global Balkans", Brzezinski makes use of Halford J. Mackinder's Heartland Theory.

Quizmania was an Australian phone-in quiz show, based on the British program of the same name, and broadcast on the Nine Network in the late night time slot (post-midnight).  The show was produced from Nine's Richmond studios in Melbourne. Its main Director was Rick Maslan.
Quizmania was first broadcast live on Nine Network stations GTV, TCN, QTQ, and NTD, and affiliates NBN and WIN Television on 25 July 2006. The show was unique in that it was broadcast live to South Australia, Western Australia, and Northern Territory with the presenters welcoming all three states to the show half an hour after it started, due to all three states being thirty minutes behind the Australian east coast.  Similarly during daylight saving months, Queensland viewers were welcomed an hour later when the broadcast began in that state.
Sometimes due to varying program schedules in each capital city or regional area, some cities and/or areas did not broadcast Quizmania while other cities and/or areas still received the broadcast. 
Only contestants aged 18 or over were allowed to participate. Underage callers were a regular occurrence on the show especially during school holidays.

Taj Mihelich (born 31 August 1973 in Ann Arbor, Michigan) is an American Freestyle BMX rider. He is probably best known for his part ownership of Terrible One with fellow rider, Joe Rich until March 2006.
He is currently sponsored by Odyssey.
He first began riding at the age of 12 and was brought to the world of Freestyle BMX by Ron Kilmer, who appeared with Taj in the celebrated "Road Fools" videos.
After years riding for the company Hoffman Bikes, he started Terrible One with Joe Rich, by releasing the "Barcode" bike frame, largely based on Taj's signature bike design at Hoffman Bikes.
It was rumored that Taj was displeased with the way that his signature frame was holding up after Hoffman Bikes moved their manufacturing overseas, and that he didn't want his name attached to something that he felt was of substandard quality.
Taj was also sponsored by Etnies, where he had several signature shoes as well as appearing in the widely recognized "Forward" video featuring the Etnies BMX team.
In late March 2006, Taj announced, that he would be leaving his half of Terrible One to Joe Rich, via the company's website. He cited the stresses of running a company as a key factor in this decision. Despite this, he will continue to ride for the company.
In early 2008 Taj announced that he would be riding for Giant bicycles, a large corporation. He rode for Giant throughout 2008 and 2009, but they dropped their entire BMX program in 2010. Taj is now currently a part of the Sunday Bikes trails team.
In 2010, Taj launched an all-purpose road, commuter and town bicycle company called Fairdale Bicycles.[tpl]cite web|first=Fat Tony|title=Taj Mihelich Launches Fairdale Bicycles|url=http://bmx.transworld.net/1000112255/news/taj-mihelich-launches-fairdale-bicycles/|publisher=Transworld BMX|accessdate=25 July 2013[/tpl]

[[Basis trading]]

CATEGORIES: Derivatives (finance)

Basis trading is a financial trading strategy which consists of the purchase of a particular financial instrument or commodity and the sale of its related derivative  (for example the purchase of a particular bond and the sale of a related futures contract).
Basis trading is done when the investor feels that the two instruments are mispriced relative to one other and that the mispricing will correct itself so that the gain on one side of the trade will more than cancel out the loss on the other side of the trade. In the case of such a trade taking place on a security and its related futures contract, the trade will be profitable if the purchase price plus the net cost of carry is less than the futures price.

Giuseppe Spataro (12 June 1897 - 1979) was an Italian political figure. Spataro was born in Vasto, Italy to Anna and Alfonso Nasci, who were a high-class Italian family, in the urban center within the province Chieti.
After studying in his birth city of Vasto, Spataro transferred to a boarding school called Montecassino in 1908, the adjustment to this new life made easier by the death of his father in 1910. In 1914, Spataro incepted his time at Facolta di Giurisprudenza in Rome, and earned his diploma in 1919.
During the First World War, Spataro served as a "corpo specializzato del Genio, later to be promoted as an official.
Already distinguished within the main catholic-roman journalist firms, he became an exponent member of FUCI. In 1919, he was elected vice president, later advanced as president of FUCI in 1920. Following his presidency at FUCI, Spataro was elected vice-president at another organization called Pax Romana. Eventually, Spataro’s close relations with Luigi Sturzo- led to his membership to the Roman sector of the Partito Popolare Italiano, or the Italian Popular Party in 1919. From 1921 to 1925, Spataro served as the sole national vice-secretary.
In 1923, Spataro married Letizia De Giorgio, and later had 3 children: Alfonso, Anna and PierGiorgio. Following his marriage, in June 1925, Spataro became the principal organizer of the international “V” congress of the party. Soon after, from 1945-1946, he became the vice secretary of internal affairs, in 1946, he was elected member of the National council and president of RAI. Through his control of this radio, and then television programming, Spataro was able to create the basis for his future Democratic-Christian control over the media. He held this post, until 1950, when he stepped down as president of RAI to assume position as minister of communications. In 1953, Spataro became minister of social work, and between 1953-1954, Spataro rose as vice secretary of the Partito Popolare. In 1960, he became the minister of “Marina mercantile” and the minister of internal affairs as well as the minister of transportation.

Vijay Stambha (Hindi: विजय स्तम्भ) or "Tower of Victory" is an imposing structure located in Chittorgarh fort in Rajasthan, India. This tower is the piece-de-resistance of Chittaurgarh. It was constructed by  Mewar king  Rana Kumbha between 1442 AD and 1449 AD to commemorate his victory over the combined armies of Malwa and Gujarat led by Mahmud Khilji.
Dedicated to Vishnu,this 37.19 m high 9 storied tower is one of the most remarkable in India. It is built partly of red sand stone and partly of white marble and is enriched by numerous images of Hindu gods and goddesses with inscriptions at bottom of each. It is believed that the tower took 10 years to be completed. This exemplary piece of architecture stands on a pedestal 10 feet high. Each of the nine stories are distinctly marked with openings and balconies at every face of each story. The interior staircase winds alternately through the central chamber and surrounding gallery.
The inscribed slabs in the uppermost story contains genealogy of the rulers of Chittaur from Hamir to Rana Kumbha. The entire tower is covered with architectural ornaments and inscribed images of gods and goddesses, seasons, weapons, musical instruments, etc. Its inscribed sculpture are a veritable text-book of Hindu iconography. The portraits of the architect of this tower Jaita and his 3 sons, Napa, Puja, and Poma are carved on the fifth floor of the tower. There are around 157 narrow steps leading to the terrace from where one can have a beautiful view of Chittorgarh town and the fort. The uppermost floor has been sealed off and is no longer accessible to visitors.
The Jain Kirti Stambha in the fort dates from the 13th century and is thus about two centuries older.
The tower is said to be the home of the Á Bao A Qu, as described in the Book of Imaginary Beings by Jorge Luis Borges.

[[Received signal code power]]
CATEGORIES: Mobile telecommunications standards, 3GPP standards

In the UMTS cellular communication system, received signal code power (RSCP) denotes the power measured by a receiver on a particular physical communication channel.  It is used as an indication of signal strength, as a handover criterion, in downlink power control, and to calculate path loss.  In CDMA systems, a physical channel corresponds to a particular spreading code, hence the name (Received signal code power).
While RSCP can be defined generally for any CDMA system, it is more specifically used in UMTS. Also, while RSCP can be measured in principle on the downlink as well as on the uplink, it is only defined for the downlink and thus presumed to be measured by the UE and reported to the Node B.

[[Otomi language]]

CATEGORIES: Agglutinative languages, Otomi language

Otomi ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|oʊ|t|ə|ˈ|m|iː[/tpl]; Spanish: Otomí [tpl]IPA-es|otoˈmi|lang[/tpl]) is a group of closely related indigenous languages of Mexico, spoken by approximately 240,000 indigenous Otomi people in the central altiplano region of Mexico.[tpl]harvcoltxt|INEGI|2009|p=69[/tpl] It belongs to the Oto-Pamean branch of the Oto-Manguean language family. It is a dialect continuum of closely related languages, because many of the varieties are not mutually intelligible. The word Hñähñu [tpl]IPA-oax|hɲɑ̃hɲṹ|[/tpl] has been proposed as an endonym, but since it represents the usage of a single dialect it has not gained wide currency. Linguists have classified the modern dialects into three dialect areas: the Northwestern dialects spoken in Querétaro, Hidalgo and Guanajuato; the Southwestern dialects spoken in the State of Mexico; and the Eastern dialects spoken in the highlands of Veracruz, Puebla, and eastern Hidalgo and in villages in Tlaxcala and Mexico states.
Like all other Oto-Manguean languages, Otomi is a tonal language and most varieties distinguish three tones. Nouns are marked only for possessor; plural number is marked with a definite article and by a verbal suffix, and some dialects maintain dual number marking. There is no case marking. Verb morphology can be described as either fusional or agglutinating depending on the analysis.[tpl]harvcoltxt|Palancar|2009|p=14[/tpl]: "Desde un punto de vista de la tipología morfológica clásica greenbergiana el otomí es una lengua fusional que se convertiría, por otro lado en aglutinante si todos los clíticos se reanalizaran como afijos (From the point of view of the classic Greenbergian morphological typologogy, Otomí is a fusional language which would however turn into an agglutinating one if all the clitics were reanalyzed as affixes)" In verb inflection, infixation, consonant mutation, and apocope are prominent processes, and the number of irregular verbs is large. The grammatical subject in a sentence is cross-referenced by a class of morphemes that can be analysed as either proclitics or prefixes and which also mark for tense, aspect and mood. Verbs are inflected for either direct object or dative object (but not for both simultaneously) by suffixes. Grammar also distinguishes between inclusive 'we' and exclusive 'we'.
After the Spanish conquest Otomi became a written language when friars taught the Otomi to write the language using the Latin script; the written language of the colonial period is often called Classical Otomi. Several codices and grammars were composed in Classical Otomi. A negative stereotype of the Otomi promoted by the Nahuas and perpetuated by the Spanish resulted in a loss of status for the Otomi, who began to abandon their language in favor of Spanish. The attitude of the larger world toward the Otomi language began to change in 2003 when Otomi was granted recognition as a national language under Mexican law together with 61 other indigenous languages.

The parish boundary is defined by water on all sides, by the Old River Ancholme, Kettleby Beck and North Kelsey Beck.
Within the parish, at Newstead on the River Ancholme, lies the site of the Gilbertine Holy Trinity Priory, founded by Henry II in 1171, and endowed with the island of Ancholme, and lands around Cadney and Hardwick. The priory was limited to 13 canons and lay brothers. It was surrendered in 1538 under the act of suppression. On the site of the priory stands Newstead Priory Farmhouse, which retains the remains of a Norman vaulted room and a Perpendicular window.Cox, J. Charles (1916) Lincolnshire pp. 91, 92; Methuen & Co.

[[Only Your Love]]

CATEGORIES: 1990 singles, Bananarama songs, London Records singles, Songs written by Sara Dallin, Songs written by Martin Glover

"Only Your Love" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It was released as the first single from the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was issued several months prior to the release of the album.  The Pop Life album marked a break for Bananarama from their long-standing relationship with the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) production trio.  "Only Your Love" was co-written and produced by Youth.  The album version of the song was remixed for its single release.
The song's primary rhythm, complete with 'Woo Woo' hoots, directly references "Sympathy for the Devil". This led Jonathan Ross to jokingly thank 'The Rolling Stones' after Bananarama had performed the song on his TV show. The song also contains samples of "Loaded" by Primal Scream and "Fool's Gold" by The Stone Roses, two songs that had been recent pop and dance hits in the UK. Upon its release "Only Your Love" received positive critical reviews.  The song was not released as a single in the United States.
"Only Your Love" peaked at number twenty-seven in the UK singles chart, which the group considered to be a disappointment.  The single did not fare much better in other countries,  hitting number forty-nine in New Zealand and fifty-one in Australia.

[tpl]Gluck operas[/tpl]La fausse esclave ("The False Slave") is an opéra comique in one act by Christoph Willibald Gluck. It has a French-language libretto based on Louis Anseaume and Pierre-Augustin Lefèvre de Marcouville’s libretto for La fausse aventurière (The False Adventuress), an opéra comique by Jean Louis Laruette. It was first performed on 8 January 1758 at the Burgtheater in Vienna.  The full score is lost, but a keyboard version is extant.
Klaus Hortschansky has noted that La fausse esclave is one of Gluck's few stageworks where the composer did not use musical material from prior works, or recycle material from it into future works.Selden, Margery Stomne, Review of Parodie und Entlehnung im Schaffen Christoph Willibald Glucks by Klaus Hortschansky (Spring 1976).

"Preacher Man" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It appears on the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was released as the album's second single.  The track was co-written and produced by Youth with additional production and remix by Shep Pettibone.
"Tripping on Your Love" had been originally slated as the second single from the album, and some promotional singles of the song were sent to radios in late 1990. Around this time, however, group member Sara Dallin contracted meningitis, which delayed the release of the single some months. When recovered, London Records decided "Preacher Man" was a better choice for a single and so it was chosen for release in December 1990. "Tripping on Your Love" was eventually released as the album's fourth single. 
The pop/dance tune became the highest-charting and biggest-selling single released from the Pop Life album, climbing to number twenty in the UK singles chart.  The single was Bananarama's last appearance in the UK top twenty until "Move in My Direction" in 2005.  It briefly appeared in the Australian Kent Report chart, peaking at 100, but did not enter the 'official' Australian ARIA Chart top 100.  "Preacher Man" was not released in the United States.

Linwood Barclay (born 1955) is an American-born Canadian author, noted as a novelist, humourist, and (former) columnist. His popular detective novels are bestsellers in Canada and internationally, beginning with No Time for Goodbye in 2007.
He was born in Darien, Connecticut, son of Muriel and Everett Barclay. His father was a professional illustrator who moved his family to Canada in 1959 where he had accepted a job with William R. Templeton Studios in Toronto. In 1966 the Barclay family purchased a vacation campground in Bobcageon, Ontario, which they ran for about five years until the death of his father from lung cancer.
Linwood Barclay recognized his interest in writing detective fiction at an early age, inspired by the works of Ross MacDonald (Kenneth Millar).[tpl]cite news|last=Medley|first=Mark|title=The King of Spooky: Linwood Barclay’s rise from suburban dad to Canada’s biggest fiction export|url=http://www.torontolife.com/informer/features/2013/07/22/linwood-barclay-the-king-of-spooky/?page=all#tlb_multipage_anchor_1|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=Toronto Life|date=22 July 2013[/tpl] After graduating high school Barclay studied literature at Trent University in Peterborough, where one of his teachers was the noted novelist Margaret Laurence. While at university, he began a correspondence with Kenneth Millar that proved inspirational for Barclay. They met once, at which time Millar inscribed one of his books to Barclay, "For Linwood, who will, I hope, someday outwrite me."
After graduation, he could not sell any of his novels so he found work on a number of local newspapers, eventually landing a job at the Toronto Star in 1981. In 1993, following the death of Gary Lautens, he began to write a thrice-weekly humour column for the paper. He also released podcasts of his articles and published three collections: Mike Harris Made Me Eat My Dog, Father Knows Zilch: A Guide for Dumbfounded Dads, and This House Is Nuts!. Between 2004 and 2007, while still writing his column, he published four mystery/comedies, all featuring a sleuth named Zack Walker who works as a newspaper columnist by day. The books were published in England and were modestly successful.
His break came in 2007 when he published No Time for Goodbye. A runaway bestseller in the United Kingdom, it quickly sold a million copies there and elsewhere. He took a one year sabbatical to promote his novel and he planned to return to the Star in September 2008 but on June 28, 2008 he wrote his last column, announcing his retirement from the Star.

[[Defensive computing]]

CATEGORIES: Computer security exploits

Defensive computing is a form of practice for computer users to help reduce the risk of computing problems, by avoiding dangerous computing practices. The primary goal of this method of computing is to be able to anticipate and prepare for potentially problematic situations prior to their occurrence, despite any adverse conditions of a computer system or any mistakes made by other users. This can be achieved through adherence to a variety of general guidelines, as well as the practice of specific computing techniques.
Strategies for defensive computing could be divided into two categories, network security and the backup and restoration of data.

Sir Thomas Davies Lloyd, 1st Baronet (May 21, 1820 – July 21, 1877), was a British Liberal Member of Parliament, for Cardiganshire (Ceredigion) 1865-1868 and Cardigan Boroughs 1868-1874. An old fashioned Whig Liberal, he defeated David Davies of Llandinam for Cardiganshire, 1865. Although he coveted a peerage and spent a fortune in pursuit of that aim, he had to be content with a baronetcy.
He was the son of Thomas Lloyd of Cilrhiwe and Bronwydd, Cardiganshire, who had been the High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1814.[tpl]cite web |url= http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-LLOY-DAV-1820.html| title= Welsh Biography Online| publisher= National Library of Wales|accessdate= 2011-04-08[/tpl] He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford.  In 1840, he joined the 13th Light Dragoons, and was a commander in Ottawa, Canada with the 82nd Foot.  He married Henrietta Mary, fourth daughter of George Reid, Esquire, of Jamaica.  Returning to Wales, he was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1851, and in 1863 was created a baronet.
He rebuilt Bronwydd as a Victorian Gothic fantasy 1853-6. The house is now a ruin, in the process of clearance. He restored the old castle at Newport, Pembrokeshire as a seat for his 'Marcher Lordship' of Cemais and Llangynllo Church. His chivalric fantasies left the estate deeply in debt.
He was succeeded by his son, Sir Marteine Lloyd, 2nd Baronet.

"Long Train Runnin'" (or "Long Train Running") is a song written by musician Tom Johnston and recorded by The Doobie Brothers. It was included on the band's 1973 album The Captain and Me and released as a single, becoming a top-ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 8. This song became very famous for its intro with the guitar.
Nearly 20 years later, "Long Train Runnin'" became a hit in the UK twice. In 1991, the song was covered by English girl group Bananarama, and in 1993, the Doobie Brothers version was remixed and hit the top 10.
The song is sometimes titled "Long Train Runnin' (Without Love)" due to the words "without love" being sung twice in the chorus.

[[Critical apparatus]]

CATEGORIES: Bibliography, Textual criticism, Textual scholarship

The critical apparatus (or Latin: [tpl]lang|la|apparatus criticus[/tpl]) is the critical and primary source material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of textual criticism.
Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from Hamlet, which the Oxford Complete Works (1988) prints as follows:William Shakespeare, The Complete Works (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682
The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1997), p. 408.
The format of the apparatus has several parts:
To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a siglum. In Shakespeare editions, F always signifies the First Folio; the second through fourth folios are referred to as F2 through F4 respectively. Similarly, Q1 is the first quarto, Q2 the second quarto, and Q3 the third.
In the example given, the first folio (F) and the three early quartos (Q1 to Q3) each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by G. R. Hibbard. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.
This format has been used for critical apparatuses of Shakespeare and many other authors. In variorum editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford Complete Works breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.
In the United States, bibliographer Fredson Bowers established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

It was based on the earlier, First World War-era design of the 15 cm sFH 13, and while improved over that weapon, it was generally outdated compared to the weapons it faced. It was, however, the first artillery weapon equipped with rocket-assisted ammunition to increase range. The sFH 18 was also used in the self-propelled artillery piece schwere Panzerhaubitze 18/1 (more commonly known as Hummel). 
The sFH 18 was one of Germany's three main 15 cm calibre weapons, the others being the 15 cm Kanone 18, a corps-level heavy gun, and the 15 cm sIG 33, a short-barreled infantry gun.

Altamura Cathedral ([tpl]lang-it|Duomo di Alamura[/tpl], Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta), dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the city of Altamura, in the province of Bari, Apulia, in southern Italy.
Since 1986 it has been the seat of the Bishop of Altamura-Gravina-Acquaviva delle Fonti, formed in that year. Previously it was the church of the territorial prelature of Altamura (from 1848, Altamura e Acquviva delle Fonti).
It was built by Emperor Frederick II in 1232, and became one of the most venerated sanctuaries in Apulia. In 1248, under pressure from Frederick, Pope Innocent IV declared Altamura exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop of Bari, making it a "palatine" church, one of four in Apulia.Palatine churches were exempt from episcopal jurisdiction, and came instead under that of the sovereign, who usually nominated and paid their clergy. The other three palatine churches in Apulia were Acquaviva Cathedral, the Basilica of San Nicola in Bari and the church of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano. 
The current orientation of the church is opposite to the original one, although it is not known if the change dates to Robert of Anjou's reign (early 14th century) or to the enlargement carried out in 1521-1547. The northern portal dates from Robert's time, while the second bell tower, the altar area and the sacristy were added in the 16th century. From the 18th century are the upper parts of the two bell towers and the small loggia between them.

The single was Ministry's biggest hit, topping out on the Billboard Modern Rock chart at #11. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=110243|title=Ministry Mainman Comments On Fifth Grammy Nomination|date=2008-12-04|publisher=Blabbermouth.net[/tpl]
The song is a protest against then President George H. W. Bush. The song features audio samples of his voice, with him repeating "A new world order" over and over again at the end of the song. At this point of the song in the video, Bush is portrayed by an actor with an enormous papier-mâché head, grabbing his crotch and waving his arms. The majority of the video is a mix of police beatings, riots, and gunfights. It also includes a scene in which a woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty is beaten by police in a manner similar to the famous amateur video of Rodney King being beaten by police.
The music video was featured on Beavis and Butt-Head along with "Just One Fix" off the same album, although the credits for each song call the album Psalms 69. 
"N.W.O." was featured in the soundtrack of the film Cool World (Songs from the Cool World).
"It's alright! It's alright!" in the song is a clip of Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now when he first greets the PBR boat.
The song was featured in the video game Need for Speed: The Run.http://www.needforspeed.com/en_GB/post/need-speed-soundtrack-announced?source=therun

The Copa Master de Supercopa was a football competition contested by clubs that had previously won the Supercopa Libertadores. It was organized by CONMEBOL and only played in 1992 and 1995.
The format of the tournament was different in both editions and a third edition was scheduled to be played in 1998 but the lack of sponsors delayed the event and eventually was cancelled. The first edition in 1992 featured all 4 champions at the time. It was played in Buenos Aires and won by Boca Juniors. The second edition was to be played in 1994 but moved to 1995. Only two eligible teams accepted the invitation to play. The cup was played over two legs and won by Cruzeiro.
The winners of the competitions were also given the chance to participate in a following-season grand super cup called the Copa de Oro. This competition was played three times. The first two competitions featured the respective Copa Master de Supercopa champion; however, as no Copa Master de Supercopa was contested in 1996, the vacant berth for the 1996 Copa de Oro went to the 1996 Copa Master de CONMEBOL champion.

[[Tripping on Your Love]]
CATEGORIES: 1991 singles, Bananarama songs, London Records singles, Songs written by Sara Dallin, Songs written by Martin Glover

"Tripping on Your Love" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It appears on the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was released as the album's fourth single in the UK and the first single in the United States.  The track was co-written and produced by Youth.
The single is considered by Bananarama to be their biggest commercial flop in the UK, just missing the top 75 of the UK singles chart.  It was originally intended to be the album's second single (following "Only Your Love") but was delayed as two different songs were released as singles.  By the time "Tripping on Your Love" was issued, Jacquie O'Sullivan had announced her departure from the group, and Bananarama's long-time manager Hillary Shaw also quit http://www.bananaramauk.com/html/discography/singles/trippingonyourlove/toylmain.html.  In addition, group member Sara Dallin was pregnant with her first child, which made promotion nearly impossible.
The song is a fusion of acid house, South Asian, rap, and Caribbean music. The album version was remixed by Robin Hancock before it was released as a single. It was not included on the original version of The Very Best of Bananarama, but a remix was included on a special edition bonus CD of the compilation.
The single's biggest success came in U.S. dance clubs, climbing to number fourteen on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.  It would be Bananarama's last appearance on that chart until 2006 when "Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)" peaked at number two. The song boasts the most commissioned remixes of any Bananarama single (twenty mixes by nine different remixers, including George Michael).
In 2007 Keren said she considered the song to be one of the band's best.True Confessions Over Lunch

Suzanne Déchevaux-Dumesnil (1900 – 17 July 1989)Not Deschevaux-Dumesnil, though that spelling mistake is very common. See picture of the Beckett Gravestone at http://www.samuel-beckett.net/samgrave.jpgSuzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil at findagrave.com was the tennis partner, lover, and later wife of Samuel Beckett. 
In the 1930s, Beckett, an avid tennis fan his whole life, chose Déchevaux-Dumesnil as his lover over the heiress Peggy Guggenheim. Six years older than Beckett, Déchevaux-Dumesnil was an austere woman known for avant-garde tastes and left-wing politics. 
During the Second World War, Beckett joined the French Resistance. For over two years, he and Déchevaux-Dumesnil hid from the Germans in a village in the South of France.Context of Happy Days at sparknotes.com
Beckett's Waiting for Godot has been called "a metaphor for the long walk into Roussillon, when Beckett and Suzanne slept in haystacks... during the day and walked by night..."Bair, Deirdre, Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), pp 409, 410 
During the relationship between Beckett and Déchevaux-Dumesnil, which lasted more than fifty years, she maintained a private circle of friends and is credited with having influenced Beckett to produce more work.
During the late 1950s, Beckett often stayed in London, where he met Barbara Bray, a BBC script-editor, a widow in her thirties. James Knowlson writes of them: "Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted to her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life."Knowlson, James, Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), pp. 458, 459 Soon, their association became "a very intimate and personal one".Cronin, Anthony, Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist (London: Flamingo, 1997), p. 495 In a visit to Paris in January 1961, Bray told Beckett she had decided to move there.Knowlson, op. cit, p. 480 His response was unusual. In March, 1961, he married Déchevaux-Dumesnil in a civil ceremony in Folkestone. On the face of it, this was to make sure that if he died before her Déchevaux-Dumesnil would inherit the rights to his work, since there was no common-law marriage under French law. He may also have wanted to affirm his loyalty to her. In June, 1961, Bray moved to Paris, and despite his recent marriage Beckett spent much of his time with her.Cronin, op. cit., p. 500 This side of his life was not well known, as Beckett’s reserve was "allied to his fear of giving offence to Suzanne".Cronin, op. cit., pp. 517-518 Beckett's play Play (1963) seems to be inspired by these events.
Déchevaux-Dumesnil died in July 1989, five months before Beckett. They are interred together in the Cimetière de Montparnasse in Paris.

Media Foundation (MF) is a COM-based multimedia framework pipeline and infrastructure platform for digital media in Windows Vista, Windows 7 & Windows 8. It is the intended replacement for Microsoft DirectShow, Windows Media SDK, DirectX Media Objects (DMOs) and all other so-called "legacy" multimedia APIs such as Audio Compression Manager (ACM) and Video for Windows (VfW). The existing DirectShow technology is intended to be replaced by Media Foundation step-by-step, starting with a few features. For some time there will be a co-existence of Media Foundation and DirectShow. Media Foundation will not be available for previous Windows versions, including Windows XP.
The first release, present in Windows Vista, focuses on audio and video playback quality, high-definition content (i.e. HDTV), content protection and a more unified approach for digital data access control for digital rights management (DRM) and its interoperability. It integrates DXVA 2.0 for offloading more of the video processing pipeline to hardware, for better performance. Videos are processed in the colorspace they were encoded in, and are handed off to the hardware, which composes the image in its native colorspace. This prevents intermediate colorspace conversions to improve performance. MF includes a new video renderer, called Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR), which is the next iteration of VMR 7 and 9. EVR has better support for playback timing and synchronization. It uses the Multimedia Class Scheduler Service (MMCSS), a new service that prioritizes real time multimedia processing, to reserve the resources required for the playback, without any tearing or glitches.
The second release included in Windows 7 introduces expanded media format support and DXVA HD for acceleration of HD content if WDDM 1.1 drivers are used.DXVA-HD

[[Smalltooth sand tiger]]

CATEGORIES: Odontaspididae

The smalltooth sand tiger or bumpytail ragged-tooth (Odontaspis ferox) is a species of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae, with a patchy but worldwide distribution in tropical and warm temperate waters. They usually inhabit deepwater rocky habitats, though they are occasionally encountered in shallow water, and have been known to return to the same location year after year. This rare species is often mistaken for the much more common grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus), from which it can be distinguished by its first dorsal fin, which is larger than the second and placed further forward. It grows to at least 4.1 m (13.5 ft) in length.
Very little is known of the biology and behavior of the smalltooth sand tiger. It is an active predator of benthic bony fishes, invertebrates, and cartilaginous fishes. This species is thought to be ovoviviparous with oophagous embryos like other mackerel sharks. In contrast to its formidable size and appearance, this shark is harmless, having never been known to behave aggressively towards humans. There is concern that its numbers are declining due to human activities in the Mediterranean and elsewhere, though existing data is inadequate for a full assessment of its conservation status.

The former Uganda Railway, was run by the company East African Railways jointly for the countries of Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya after World War I. Since the dissolution of the EAR corporation in 1977 the national company Kenya Railways Corporation runs the former Uganda Railway and its branches in Kenya. The most important line in the country runs between the port of Mombasa and Nairobi, where sleeping car accommodation is offered for tourists.
In 2006, the Rift Valley Railways Consortium led by South African companies took operating control of the Kenya and Uganda railways as part of a contract lasting at least 25 years. After criticism from the Kenya Railways Corporation, RVR doubled the frequency of service, and also imposed restrictions to reduce derailments on the ageing infrastructure.Restrictions

[[Faugère's F4 and F5 algorithms]]
CATEGORIES: Computer algebra

In computer algebra, the Faugère F4 algorithm, by Jean-Charles Faugère, computes the Gröbner basis of an ideal of a multivariate polynomial ring.  The algorithm uses the same mathematical principles as the Buchberger algorithm, but computes many normal forms in one go by forming a generally sparse matrix and using fast linear algebra to do the reductions in parallel.
The Faugère F5 algorithm first calculates the Gröbner basis of a pair of generator polynomials of the ideal.  Then it uses this basis to reduce the size of the initial matrices of generators for the next larger basis: 
 
 If Gprev is an already computed Gröbner basis (f2, …, fm) and we want to compute a Gröbner basis of (f1) + Gprev then we will construct matrices whose rows are m f1 such that m is a monomial not divisible by the leading term of an element of Gprev.

This strategy allows the algorithm to apply two new criteria based on what Faugère calls signatures of polynomials. Thanks to these criteria, the algorithm can compute Gröbner bases for a large class of interesting polynomial systems, called regular sequences, without ever simplifying a single polynomial to zero—the most time-consuming operation in algorithms that compute Gröbner bases. It is also very effective for a large number of non-regular sequences.

The meaning is clear for most Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians. In some other languages it has other spellings (e.g. in the non-Slavic Hungarian language it is written as "picsa"), but has similar pronunciation and carries the same meaning and profanity.

[[Electron temperature]]

CATEGORIES: Plasma physics

Temperature is a statistical quantity. The formal definition is T = dU/dS, the change in internal energy with respect to entropy holding volume and particle number constant. A practical definition comes from the fact that the atoms, molecules, or whatever particles in your system have average kinetic energy. The average specifically means to average over the kinetic energy of all the particles in your system.
The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K), but using the above relation the electron temperature is often expressed in terms of the energy unit electronvolt (eV). Each kelvin (1 K) corresponds to 8.6173324(78)×10−5 eV; this factor is the ratio of the Boltzmann constant to the elementary charge.
The electron temperature of a plasma can be several orders of magnitude higher than the temperature of the neutral species or of the ions. This is a result of two facts. Firstly, many plasma sources heat the electrons more strongly than the ions. Secondly, atoms and ions are much heavier than electrons, and energy transfer in a two-body collision is much more efficient if the masses are similar.

Following the Union of Brest the Metropolia of Kiev-Halych and all Rus broke relations with the Patriarch of Constantinople and place themselves in communion with the Patriarch of the West, thus establishing what later was known as "Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church". At first widely successful, within several decades it had lost much of its initial support, mainly due to Imperial Russian persecution, though in Galicia the church fared well and remains strong to this day.

[[Common pilot channel]]
CATEGORIES: Universal Mobile Telecommunications System

CPICH stands for Common Pilot Channel in UMTS and some other CDMA communications systems.
In WCDMA FDD cellular systems, CPICH is a downlink channel broadcast by Node Bs with constant power and of a known bit sequence. Its power is usually between 5% and 15% of the total Node B transmit power.  Commonly, the CPICH power is 10% of the typical total transmit power of 43 dBm. 
The CPICH contains 20 bits of data, which are either all zeros, or in the case that Space-Time Transmit Diversity (STTD) is employed, is a pattern of alternating 1's and 0's for transmissions on the Node B's second antenna.25.211, section 5.3.3.1 "Common Pilot Channel (CPICH)"  The first antenna of a base station always transmits all zeros for CPICH.
A UE searching for a WCDMA Node B will first use the primary and secondary synchronization channels (P-SCH and S-SCH respectively) to determine the slot and frame timing of a candidate P-CCPCH, whether STTD is in use, as well as identifying which one of 64 code groups is being used by the cell.  Crucially this allows to UE to reduce the set of possible Primary Scrambling Codes being used for P-CPICH to only 8 from 512 choices.  At this point the correct PSC can be determined through the use of a matched filter, configured with the fixed channelisation code Cch,256,0, looking for the known CPICH bit sequence, while trying each of the possible 8 PSCs in turn.  The results of each run of the matched filter can be compared, the correct PSC being identified by the greatest correlation result.
Once the scrambling code for a CPICH is known, the channel can be used for measurements of signal quality, usually with RSCP and Ec/N0.  Timing and phase estimations can also be made, providing a reference that helps to improve reliability when decoding other channels from the same Node B.
Pilot signals are not a requirement of CDMA, however, they do make the UE's receiver simpler and improve the reliability of the system.

[[Pink-Pigmented Facultative Methylotrophs]]
CATEGORIES: Rhizobiales

Commonly abbreviated to PPFMs, these bacteria are members of the genus Methylobacterium and are commonly found in soil, dust, various fresh water supplies and on plant surfaces. Research has suggested that PPFMs can benefit host plants in a variety of ways such as promoting germination, growth and yield of sugarcane, and accumulation of vitamin B in lettuce. Their pigmentation, which is frequently pink but may also be yellow or orange, is thought to provide protection from solar UV radiation which damages the DNA of bacteria at low doses because of their small cell size.
The metabolism of PPFMs is unusual because, as their name suggests, they are able to utilize C1 compounds such as formaldehyde, methanol and methylamine. In dense and diverse communities like those found in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere, this enables them to utilize nutrients other bacteria cannot, enhancing their competitive ability.
Although gram negative, Methylobacteria often stain gram variable and do not grow on MacConkey agar. ...

Nikele (Nik) Moyake (c. 1933 - c. 1969) was a jazz musician from South Africa, who played tenor saxophone in the sextet The Blue Notes alongside Chris McGregor, Dudu Pukwana, Mongezi Feza, Johnny Dyani and Louis Moholo. He was born in the early 1930s, making him by far the oldest member of the band, but he was also the band's most accomplished soloist in its early days. His playing can be heard extensively on the Blue Notes CDs Township Bop and Legacy: Live In South Africa.
When the group emigrated to Europe en masse in 1964, he quickly became isolated from the rest of the band through a combination of illness and homesickness. Also, as the oldest member, he struggled to adapt to the changes in the music brought about by the rapid maturing of his younger band mates. He returned to South Africa in 1965, and within a year had died of a brain tumour.

Saint Gaetano Catanoso (February 14, 1879 - April 4, 1963) was an Italian parish priest canonized by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.Vatican website: Biography of Gaetano CatanosoVatican website: Synod press release, 23.10.2005
Born to a prosperous family in Chorio, a small village outside of Reggio Calabria in the Aspromonte. Gaetano was one of eight children. He was ordained on September 20, 1902 and served as a parish priest his entire career. His first parish was in the remote hill village of Pentedattilo, where he served from 1904 until 1921. Extremely passionate about emulating the life of Christ in his service to the poor, Padre Catanoso would hike or ride on donkey to distant, surrounding mountain villages to bring the gospel and hope to isolated people in desperate circumstances. To help him in this cause, he founded an order of nuns—the Veronican Sisters of the Holy Face in 1934.Butler's Lives Of The Saints (April) by Alban Butler (1999) ISBN 0860122530 page 28
The nuns were mostly young women from poor families who were inspired by Padre Gaetano's humility, devotion and mission. Together, they established elementary schools and homes for the elderly in tiny places like San Lorenzo, Roccaforte and Chorio to educate children and care for the old and sick. The goal was to combat ignorance and the Mafia through education and the word of God. Padre Catanoso also founded the Poor Clerics to encourage priestly vocations. He was transferred to Santa Maria de la Candelaria in Reggio, Calabria in 1921. 
Catanoso had a deep devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and formed the "Confraternity of the Holy Face" in 1920. He wrote:  "The Holy Face is my life. He is my strength". He also revived Marian and Eucharistic devotions, improved catechesis, and worked for observance of liturgical feasts. Worked for cooperation among local priests to provide missions by preaching and hearing confessions in each other's parishes. Spiritual director for several religious institutions, a prison, hospital and seminary for decades. Through all of this service, he was also devoted to the Catanoso family of Chorio and Reggio, serving as a spiritual mentor and trusted counselor. 
The Catanoso family through the generations has supported his mission and his nuns. Padre Gaetano's mission has also spread to the Philippines and Tanzania. His rise to sainthood, which began in 1979, was remarkably rapid, just 26 years from start to finish. Most causes for sainthood take many decades or even centuries. On May 4, 1997 Pope John Paul II beatified him and on October 23, 2005 Pope Benedict XVI canonized him. Two healing miracles have been researched, verified and attributed to him by the Vatican. 
An American relative of the saint, journalist Justin Catanoso of Greensboro, North Carolina, has written a family a memoir about Padre Gaetano Catanoso. The book is titled My Cousin the Saint -- A Search for Faith, Family and Miracles. It was released by William Morrow, a division of HarperCollins Publishers, in May 2008.
The book was published in paperback by Harper Perennial in 2009 with the revised subtitle "A Story of Love, Miracles, and an Italian Family Reunited."

[[Common control physical channel]]

CATEGORIES: Universal Mobile Telecommunications System

CCPCH stands for Common Control Physical CHannel in UMTS and some other CDMA communications systems.  It is a broadcast radio channel by which a mobile phone or user equipment can decode and determine important system parameters before establishing a dedicated communications link.
In a FDD UMTS system, there are two CCPCH- Primary and Secondary. Exactly one Primary-CCPCH, which has a data rate of 27kbit/s and is always broadcast using Channelisation Code Cch,256,1.25.213, section 5.2.1 "Channelisation codes"  This channel can be detected by mobiles due to its fixed channelisation code, slot format and TTI, as well as being time aligned to the Synchronisation Channel which replaces the first 2 bits of P-CCPCH in every slot.  The Broadcast Control Channel (BCH) transport channel is mapped onto the P-CCPCH, allowing mobiles to decode important system parameters prior to establishing a dedicated connection.  One or more Secondary-CCPCHs are also provided to broadcast paging blocks and FACH messages.
The P-CCPCH in a TDD-mode UMTS system also carries pilot bits in (in contrast to FDD-mode, which provides a distinct pilot channel named CPICH).  The pilot bits on the CCPCH can be used for measurements of the signal quality (e.g. RSCP, Ec/Io, etc.) and for synchronisation and timing reference when decoding other channels from the same transmitter.

[[Outhgill]]
CATEGORIES: Hamlets in Cumbria

thumb|left|200px|St Mary's Church, OuthgillOuthgill is a hamlet in Mallerstang, Cumbria. It lies about 5 miles south of Kirkby Stephen.
It is the main hamlet in the dale of Mallerstang (a civil parish) which retains the Norse pattern of its original settlement: a series of small hamlets and isolated houses, with no village centre. In the 19th century, as the main hamlet at the centre of the dale, Outhgill had an inn, a post office, a smithy, the parish church and a Methodist chapel. Of these, only the church survives.
St Mary's Church was founded by Lady Ideonea de Veteripont in the 14th century (possibly 1311) but was restored, in fact more or less rebuilt, in 1663 by Lady Anne Clifford, as the plaque above the door relates. The simple, dignified interior contains an 18th-century font, a faded coat of arms of Lady Anne from the year she restored the church, a set of shelves that used to hold the loaves of bread distributed weekly under Middleton's Charity, and kneelers embroidered by ladies of the dale. The stained glass windows all date from Victorian times or later.
In the churchyard there are the unmarked graves of 25 of the builders of the Mallerstang section of the Settle-Carlisle Railway, and members of their families, who died during the construction of the line. A monument to them, marking the area where they are buried, was dedicated in 1997.
Almost opposite the church is the former Wesleyan Chapel, built in 1878. There are about a dozen houses, including one where the father of the great scientist Michael Faraday was the blacksmith in the late 18th century (moving to London in the year Michael was born).

[[Chambre introuvable]]

CATEGORIES: Bourbon Restoration, 1815 in France

The Chambre introuvable (French: Unobtainable Chamber) was the first Chamber of Deputies elected after the Second Bourbon Restoration in 1815. It was dominated by Ultra-royalists who completely refused to accept the results of the French Revolution. The name was coined by King Louis XVIII of France.
The elections, held on August 14, 1815 under census suffrage and under the impact of the "White Terror", produced a heavy Ultra-royalist majority: 350 of the 402 members were Ultra-royalists.
The "Unobtainable Chamber", which was first assembled on October 7, 1815, was characterized by its zeal in favour of the aristocracy and the clergy and aimed at reestablishing the Ancien Régime. The Chambre introuvable voted the establishment of military provost-marshal courts and banished all of the Conventionnels who had voted for Louis XVI's execution. 
Louis XVIII, confronted with rising discontent in French society, followed the counsels of the Duc de Richelieu, prime minister since September 1815, the Duke of Wellington, the British commander of the occupation troops, and the Russian ambassador Pozzo di Borgo, and dissolved the Chamber on September 5, 1816.
The subsequent elections resulted in the Ultras being temporarily replaced by the more liberal Doctrinaires, who attempted to reconcile the Revolution's legacy with the monarchy.
When under the government of Jean-Baptiste, comte de Villèle, the Ultra-royalists resumed the majority in the chamber in December 1823, this chamber was dubbed Chambre retrouvée, the "Recovered Chamber", in reference to the Chambre introuvable.

Constantin Negruzzi ([tpl]IPA-ro|konstanˈtin neˈɡrut͡si[/tpl], first name often Costache [tpl]IPA-ro|kosˈtake|pron[/tpl]; 1808–24 August 1868) was a Romanian poet, novelist, translator, playwright and politician.
Born in Trifeştii Vechi, Moldavia, he studied at home with a Greek teacher. He admitted in a later article that he learnt Romanian by himself, from a book written by Petru Maior. During the 1821 Revolution, his family took refuge in Chişinău, Bessarabia, where he met Alexander Pushkin and became interested in literature. 
Notable among his writings are his memoirs - Amintiri din juneţe ("Memories of youth") - and his historical writings, Fragmente istorice ("Historical fragments"), Negru pe alb ("Black on white"), Aprodul Purice (an aprod was a minor noble title, typically the son of a lord; Purice is a proper name, but literally means "flea"; see Movileşti). He translated some of the ballads of Victor Hugo, some of Thomas Moore's poetry and Antioch Kantemir's poetry. Negruzzi wrote two plays, Muza de la Burdujeni ("The Muse of Burdujeni") and Cârlani ("Lambs"), while translating several other plays.
Negruzzi also held several functions, including finance minister and deputy under Sturdza-Vodă. A supporter of liberal causes, he was twice exiled to his house in Trifeşti for criticism of the government.

"Angie Baby" is a popular song that was written by American Alan O'Day, and became a hit for Australian singer Helen Reddy. The song reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart at the end of December 1974 and became one of Reddy's biggest-selling singles. The song also topped the U.S. adult contemporary chart, Reddy's fifth #1 on this chart.Whitburn, Joel (1996). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition (Billboard Publications) 
The song's cryptic lyrics have inspired a number of listener theories as to what the song is really about.

Reddy has also said that "Angie Baby" was the one song she never had to push radio stations into playing.

Sergei Sergeevich Yudin ([tpl]lang-ru|Серге́й Серге́евич Ю́дин[/tpl]; September 27, 1891 – March 12, 1954) was a Russian surgeon.
He was an outstanding Russian surgeon of the 20th century. Yudin lived a very productive, yet tragic, life.
Yudin was born in Moscow into the family of a factory owner.
In 1911, Yudin became a medical student at the University of Moscow. In the fall of 1914, after the beginning of the First World War, Yudin was called into the army as a junior doctor. During the war, Yudin was wounded three times. He was awarded the Cross of St. George for bravery.
In 1925, Yudin published the book "Spinal Anesthesia". In 1926 this book was awarded the F.A. Rein prize by the All-Soviet Surgical Society for the best surgical publication in 1924-1925. In the same year, Yudin was awarded a trip to the United States for 6 months. Yudin’s letters from America were published regularly in 1927-1928 in the leading Soviet surgical journal "New Surgical Archives" and probably represented the most detailed description of American surgery at that time.
After returning from the United States, in 1928, Yudin was invited to become chairman of the surgical department at the institute of emergency aid named after N.V. Sklifosovskiy in Moscow. Yudin also pioneered the transfusion of cadaveric blood and performed this successfully for the first time on March 23, 1930. In 1930, Yudin organized the world first blood bank at the Nikolay Sklifosovskiy Institute, which set an example for the establishment of further blood banks in different regions of the Soviet Union and in other countries.
During the Second World War, June 1942, Yudin was appointed a surgeon-in-chief to the army. In 1943 in recognition of his surgical achievements, Yudin was awarded honorary fellowships of the American College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Surgeons. Yudin was also an honorary member of the International College of Surgeons and of the Paris, Prague, and Catalonian surgical societies, as well an honorary doctor of Sorbonne University.
Despite his achievements and popularity, Yudin was arrested by the KGB on December 22, 1948. He was held in jail without trial for more than 3 years. His name disappeared from medical journals, articles he had submitted were not published, and his publications were removed from the libraries. In 1952, he was exiled to Siberia for 10 years to the town of Berdsk, which was 30 km away from Novosibirsk. Only after Joseph Stalin’s death in March 1953 Yudin was able to return to Moscow and recommence his work. One year later on March 12, 1954, Yudin died from myocardial infarction at the age of 62 years.

[[Celso Torrelio]]
CATEGORIES: 1933 births, 1999 deaths, Presidents of Bolivia, Bolivian generals

Celso Torrelio Villa (June 3, 1933, Chuquisaca, Bolivia - April 23, 1999, La Paz) was a military general, a member of the Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces (1981), and de facto President of Bolivia between September 1981 and August 1982.
A native of Padilla, department of Chuquisaca, Torrelio joined the Bolivian Army and rose to the rank of general. He served as the notorious dictator Luis García Meza's Minister of Interior after the departure (forced by Washington) of the equally infamous Colonel Luis Arce. The García Meza regime became internationally known for its extreme brutality. Some 1,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the Bolivian army and security forces between July 1980 and August 1981. In addition, the García Meza government was deeply involved in drug trafficking activities, and may have come to power financed directly by the drug cartels. This led to the complete isolation of the regime. Even the new, conservative U.S. President, Ronald Reagan, kept its distance and seemed to prefer better options. Eventually, the international outcry was sufficiently strong to force García Meza's resignation on August 3, 1981. The high command of the Military of Bolivia at that point entrusted General Celso Torrelio with the presidency.
Although the military's idea was to replace the polarizing García Meza with a less controversial and more acceptable leader equally as committed to the principles of the anti-communist National Security Doctrine, their plan did not come to fruition. The regime continued to be shunned internationally, and despised domestically. Furthermore, a very grave economic crisis loomed on the horizon, the result of years of mismanagement, a global recession, and the onset of the so-called Latin American debt crisis. Faced with the choices of mounting a fresh repressive campaign to re-equilibrate the reeling regime (with the increased international isolation such a move would entail) or call elections, the high command chose the latter. In July 1982, General Torrelio was replaced with General Guido Vildoso, who was charged with returning the country to democratic rule. Torrelio then retired and did not return to play any role in Bolivian politics.
Torrelio was replaced by the Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces (1982).

CATEGORIES: Modern street gangs, Gangs in New Jersey, Bloods sets

The Double II Set is a chapter of the Bloods street gang centered in East Orange, New Jersey.  Chapters of the Bloods are called "sets."
In 1993, Blood members from the Queen Street Bloods Gang ("QSBG") of Inglewood, California came to East Orange, initiating East Orange members in the practices and traditions of the west coast Bloods. East Orange is known colloquially as "Illtown," so the set was titled "Double II" (pronounced "Double EYE"). Tewhan Butler was the "Godfather" of the Double II Set.                                                                                                                                                                                  
The East Orange hip hop group Naughty by Nature cultivates the perception of a connection to the Double II Set, double spelling the letter I in album titles (e.g. "IIcons").

Phraotes was an Indo-Parthian king of the city of Taxila in northern India, met by the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana around 46 CE according to the Life of Apollonius Tyana written by Philostratus.
Apollonius reported constructions of the Greek type in Taxila,

Coins of a king "Prahat" or "Prahara", thought to be Phraotes, have been found in the area of Taxila, and it has been suggested that he might be identical with the Indo-Parthian king Gondophares.Journal of the Numismatic Society of India, 1968, vol. 30, p. 188-190.

The Hollywood Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton took place on August 12, 2000 at the private Brentwood, California estate of businessman Ken Roberts. It was produced and hosted by Peter F. Paul and Aaron Tonken, and was the largest Hollywood tribute ever produced for a sitting President of the United States.[tpl]Fact|date=February 2007[/tpl] Besides honoring President Bill Clinton, it also served as a fund raising event for the 2000 U.S. Senate election campaign of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, and was the largest such event of her campaign.[tpl]Fact|date=February 2007[/tpl] The event also included the largest invitation-only private concert, featuring eight international headlining artists.[tpl]Fact|date=February 2007[/tpl]
The event included both a dinner and a concert, and about 350 people accepted invitations to both. http://www.washtimes.com/national/20050508-115753-6895r.htm The singers during the concert included Michael Bolton, Cher, Toni Braxton, Patti Labelle, Sugar Ray, and Diana Ross. Celebrities in attendance included John Travolta, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Alexander, and Muhammad Ali and his wife Lonnie Ali. White House daughter Chelsea Clinton was also present for the event. 
Hillary Clinton's campaign failed to file proper documentation for the event with the Federal Election Commission, and later paid $35,000 in fines.
Shortly after the party, it was revealed that organizer Peter Paul had a criminal conviction for drug dealing, leading Clinton to distance herself from him. Three other men involved with the gala have also since been convicted of federal felonies. Co-organizer Aaron Tonken was sentenced to 63 months in jail for committing fraud connected with charity fund raising. Sponsor Raymond Reggie was convicted of bank fraud and served time in jail. Finally, a man named James Levin, who claimed to have been paid to "monitor" the party for Clinton pleaded guilty to a minority contracting fraud scheme involving the Chicago Public Schools."N.Y.

He was a physician as well as a disciple of the Qadi Abd al-Jabbar in Rey. He challenged some of his master’s teaching  and eventually compiled a huge (two volumes; 1500 pages) critical review of the arguments and proofs used in Islamic Scholastic Theology . This he summarised in al Mu'tamad "The Reliable". He including a critique of the qualifications a scholar of Islamic law needed to practice. His theological works were generally handed down among students of medicine and it was a century before his teaching was revived and espoused by the Mu'tazili scholar Mahmud b. al-Malahimi in Khorezm in Central Asia  where they gained recognition as a school of Mu'tazili theology.

Back to the roots (aka Spurensuche) is an Austrian exchange program. A group of fifteen young Israelis who have Austrian family roots are invited to Austria and together with fifteen young local Austrians do genealogical research about their ancestors and sometimes travel to the places where those ancestors lived.
Even though the emphasis lies on finding out information about the families of the visiting Israelis, another aim of this project is to develop Austrian-Israeli friendships and diplomacy. This includes sightseeing of cities as well as several free days, in which the young people can decide on their own what they wish to do.
This program enables the Israelis to develop their own and individual relationship to Austria and also help all the participants to regard Austria respectively from the view of "the other one".

Brooks Ulysses Lawrence (January 30, 1925 – April 27, 2000) was a Major League Baseball All-Star pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals (1954–1955), Cincinnati Redlegs (1956–1959), and Cincinnati Reds (1960). 
Lawrence was born in Springfield, Ohio, and attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.  His career started in the Negro National League, where he earned the nickname "Bull".
His Major League debut came in 1954.  As a 29-year-old rookie, Lawrence went 15–6 with a 3.74 ERA while starting and relieving for the 1954 St. Louis Cardinals.  Lawrence struggled in 1955 and he was demoted to Oakland (in the Pacific Coast League), but he went 5–1 down the stretch and earned a second chance with the big-league club.
Lawrence's best season came in 1956. Prior to that year, St. Louis sent Lawrence and Sonny Senerchia to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Jackie Collum. With the Reds that season, Lawrence posted a 19–10 record and a 3.99 ERA. He opened the season with 13 consecutive wins and earned a spot on the National League All-Star team. That year he led the Reds in wins, innings pitched and shutouts. 
Lawrence's career came to a close in 1960, and he retired with an overall record of 69–62 with a 4.25 ERA in 1,040.7 innings pitched. Thanks largely to his 13-game winning streak and his association with the surprisingly successful 1956 Reds club, Lawrence earned induction into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1976.
After his retirement from baseball, Lawrence worked for International Harvester in his hometown of Springfield, Ohio. He later worked for the Cincinnati Reds in scouting, minor league player development, and radio and television. 
He died on April 27, 2000.

[[Trigonometry in Galois fields]]
CATEGORIES: Finite fields, Trigonometry

In mathematics, trigonometry analogies are supported by the theory of quadratic extensions of finite fields, also known as Galois fields. The main motivation to deal with a finite field trigonometry is the power of the discrete transforms, which play an important role in engineering and mathematics. Significant examples are the well-known discrete trigonometric transforms (DTT), namely the discrete cosine transform and discrete sine transform, which have found many applications in the fields of digital signal and image processing. In the real DTTs, inevitably, rounding is necessary, because the elements of its transformation matrices are derived from the calculation of sines and cosines. This is the main motivation to define the cosine transform over prime finite fields. In this case, all the calculation is done using integer arithmetic.
In order to construct a finite field transform that holds some resemblance with a DTT or with a discrete transform that uses trigonometric functions as its kernel, like the discrete Hartley transform, it is firstly necessary to establish the equivalent of the cosine and sine functions over a finite structure.

Luis Arce Gómez (Born in 1938 in Sucre) was a colonel in the Bolivian Army. In 1980 he backed the bloody coup (sometimes referred to as the "Cocaine Coup") that brought to power the infamous General Luis García Meza. Arce served as García Meza's   Minister of the Interior.
Arce's tenure as Minister involved the passing of such measures as the banning of all political parties, the incarceration and/or exile of most political opponents, the repression of trade unions, and the censorship of the mass media.   Arce is reported to have said that all Bolivians who may be opposed to the new order should "walk around with their written will under their arms." [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] 
The García Meza government was also deeply involved in drug trafficking activities, with Arce as a link.  Eventually, Arce was forced to resign, as was  García. In the late 1980s, Arce was extradited to the United States, where he was put in jail, serving a lengthy sentence for drug trafficking. On April 21, 1993, while he was still incarcerated, he was condemned by the Bolivian justice system to 30 years in prison for serious human rights violations incurred by the regime he took part in.Piden extraditar a ex ministro Arce Gómez que está en cárcel de EEUU [tpl]es icon[/tpl] 
In November 2007 he was released from his US prison sentence, and applied for political asylum in the US. His application was denied, and on July 9, 2009 he was deported back to Bolivia to serve out the sentence for his convictions there. He is held in Chonchocoro Prison in La Paz. As of 2009, he is currently in poor health but has apparently expressed a willingness to speak about his role in the 1980-81 dictatorship.[ref]

 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] In September 2010, Arce Gómez offered to share his knowledge about the remains of people disappeared during the dictatorship in "exchange for something": "If they want to know something... I have to gain something as well. It's not free." His sentence is not subject to negotiation. Interior Minister Sacha Llorenti has stated that Arce Gómez could face disciplinary sanctions for refusing to reveal this information, although the legal basis for doing so is disputed by legal experts.

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]

The spider genus Theridion, after which the family Theridiidae is named, consists of almost 600 described species that occur all around the world. Notable species are the Hawaiian happy face spider – T. grallator – and T. nigroannulatum, which is one of the very few species of spiders which live in social groups and not merely aggregate by coincidence. They live in large colonies, lying in wait for passing prey purportedly concealed under the edge of a leaf or stick with threads trailing down beneath them. If an insect intrudes, interjecting itself into the web, the spiders respond en masse, overwhelming it as a team. They even take turns helping pull large victims back to their lair. Theridion braueri Simon, 1898 probably belongs into a different genus; however, Robertia the new name proposed by Saaristo (2006) is preoccupied by the mammal-like reptile Robertia.

The earliest written references are from the 15th century, when this title was conferred by the Sultans of the Delhi Sultanate upon its military nobles of Indian origins. During the Mughal era and the British rule in India, a talukh or district usually consisted of 84 villages and a central town. The talukhdar was required to collect taxes, maintain supplies and manpower to the provincial government and undertake official tasks. In most cases the talukhdar's were entitled to retain 10% of the collected revenue for their efforts. However,some privileged Taluqdars were entitled to a quarter and hence were This Title as Perfix and Suffix with individual names Used by Mainly Gujjars and Jatts. In Pakistan also Gujjars, and  Jatts use this title. These landlords use chaudhary surname to show their ancestral association with land and power during pre- independence era. Traditionally, the term is used as a title indicating the ownership of ancestral land, but in contemporary usage it is often taken as a surname or title.

[[Provider model]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, .NET framework

The provider model is a design pattern formulated by Microsoft for use in the ASP.NET Starter Kits and formalized in .NET version 2.0. It is used to allow an application to choose from one of multiple implementations or "condiments" in the application configuration, for example, to provide access to different data stores to retrieve login information, or to use different storage methodologies such as a database, binary to disk, XML, etc.
The .NET extensible provider model allows a "component" to have multiple implementations using an abstract factory pattern approach. Providers are a subclass of the ProviderBase class and typically instantiated using a factory method. 
The provider model in ASP.NET 2.0 provides extensibility points for developers to plug their own implementation of a feature into the runtime. Both the membership and role features in ASP.NET 2.0 follow the provider pattern by specifying an interface, or contract. The provider model begins with the abstract class ProviderBase. ProviderBase exists to enforce the contract that all providers need public Name and Description properties, as well as a public Initialize method. Inheriting from ProviderBase are the MembershipProvider and RoleProvider abstract classes. These classes add additional properties and methods to define the interface for their specific areas of functionality.

[[Vida (Occitan literary form)]]

CATEGORIES: Occitan literary genres

Vida ([tpl]IPA-all|ˈvida|Old Occitan[/tpl]) is the usual term for a brief prose biography, written in Old Occitan, of a troubadour or trobairitz.
The word vida means "life" in Occitan languages; they are short prose biographies of the troubadours, and they are found in some chansonniers, along with the works of the author they describe. Vidas are notoriously unreliabe: Mouzat, while complaining that some scholars still believe them, says they represent the authors as "ridiculous bohemians, and picaresque heroes"; Alfred Jeanroy calls them "the ancestors of modern novels".[tpl]cite book|last=Mouzat|first=Jean|title=Les Poèmes de Gaucelm Faidit|year=1989|publisher=Slatkine Reprints|location=Geneva-Paris|isbn=2-05-101037-4[/tpl] Most often, they are not based on independent sources, and their information is deduced from literal readings of details of the poems. Most of the vidas were composed in Italy, many by Uc de Saint Circ.
Additionally, some individual poems are accompanied by razos, explanations of the circumstances in which the poem was composed.

[[Elongation factor]]
CATEGORIES: Protein biosynthesis

Elongation factors are a set of proteins that are used in protein synthesis in the cell. In the ribosome, they facilitate translational elongation, from the formation of the first peptide bond to the formation of the last one.
Elongation is the most rapid step in translation:
Elongation factors play a role in orchestrating the events of this process, and in ensuring the 99.99% accuracy of translation at this speed.
Elongation factors are also a target for pathogen toxins. Corynebacterium diphtheriae produces the diphtheria toxin that alters protein function in the host by inactivating elongation factor (EF-2). This causes pharyngitis and pseudomembranous inflammation in the throat.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa's exotoxin A also inhibits EF-2.

[[Fairfield, Liverpool]]
CATEGORIES: Areas of Liverpool

Fairfield is an area of Liverpool, in Merseyside, England, encompassing streets between Tuebrook and Kensington and stretching to Old Swan. It consists of a variety of houses; there are some traditional red-brick terraces, larger Victorian villas and also the notable and rather wonderful 300 year-old Georgian Fairfield Crescent which is off the equally old and wonderful Prospect Vale. Hidden gems in a conservation area which were they located in a different part of Liverpool would be worth considerably more. The area also contains the Victorian Newsham Park, for which the area is notable. Friends of Newsham Park meet with council officers regularly at the Newsham Park park forum to discuss improvements to the park and are currently anticipating the start on site of the building of a new pavilion.
Fairfield is now also home to the new shopping development on Prescot Road, which brings much needed retail stores like Iceland, Tesco, Greggs and other shops into this once neglected neighbourhood centre.
Another new facility is the community fire station on Beech Street which was opened in 2010 by the Duchess of Gloucester. It has been named "Kensington" Fire Station, despite being just inside the Fairfield border. Residents of Fairfield with its 300 year old history are often cross when their area is referred to as "Kensington", and will write letters of complaint to the Liverpool Echo. They are fiercely proud of their history. Fairfield is paired with Kensington to form a Liverpool City Council Ward.
The district is primarily residential although a few industrial estate roads exist.

CATEGORIES: Living people, British historians, 1950 births

John Henry (born 1950) is Historian of Science in the Science Studies Unit at the University of Edinburgh associated with the Strong Programme.
He has written books and articles on numerous topics in the history of sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth century science including books on the work of Francis Bacon, the Scientific Revolution, and Nicolaus Copernicus. His articles include research on the work of Isaac Newton and later Newtonianism, Atomism and a range of other subjects.  Often his focus is on the unexpected links between the development of modern science and previous systems of knowledge and understanding, particularly those of Natural Magic. In this respect his work can be seen to disagree with The Zilsel Thesis which sees the emergence of modern Science as being a radical break with the previous religious or magical traditions. Instead of seeing a great rift, John Henry's work emphasises the importance of investigative techniques taken from magical traditions for many of the key figures of the scientific revolution.

Suffolk County Transit is the provider of bus services in Suffolk County, New York on Long Island in the United States and is an agency of the Suffolk County government. It was founded in 1980 as a county-run oversight and funding agency for a group of private contract operators which had previously provided such services on their own. While the physical maintenance and operation of the buses are provided by these providers, other matters ranging from bus purchases to route and schedule planning to fare rules are set by Suffolk Transit itself.
Though serving the entirety of Suffolk County, the one exception is in Huntington, located in the northwestern part of the county, where that town's private operator declined to join Suffolk Transit. Instead, Huntington took over that town's system which became Huntington Area Rapid Transit, or HART. Most of HART's routes do connect to both Suffolk Transit and Nassau Inter-County Express and one can transfer between HART and Suffolk Transit fairly easily.http://town.huntington.ny.us/department_details.cfm?ID=37 In addition, the village of Patchogue has its own local bus service.transportation

[[C-treeACE]]
CATEGORIES: Database engines, NoSQL, Proprietary database management systems

c-treeACE is a cross-platform database engine developed by FairCom Corporation. Software developers  typically embed the c-treeACE engine within the applications that they create and then deploy the application and engine together as an integrated solution.  
At its core, c-treeACE uses a record-oriented, Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) structure offering high speed indexing mechanisms over those files. Developers can use these direct access methods to design the data and index structures that closely parallel the needs of their application. This paradigm is sometimes referred to as an application-specific database[tpl]cite web|title=Application-Specific Databases|publisher=SD Times|url=http://www.sdtimes.com/link/26632|work=SD|accessdate=25 August 2011[/tpl]  or an embedded database because of the tightly coupled nature of the application and database. 
The nature of c-treeACE allows it to be used in a range of products including:  embedded systems that require limited disk and memory footprint and silent operation; shrink-wrap products developed by ISVs that require cross-platform support, minimal maintenance, and mass deployment; and enterprise systems that depend on performance and more precision control of database operations than a traditional enterprise database offers.
Two versions of the product are available. c-treeACE Express is freely available for development from FairCom's web site and supports only the client/server architecture. The client-side libraries are precompiled, making it easy to use for evaluation. c-treeACE Professional is licensed separately and supports all architectures and includes full source code for the client libraries and much of the source code for the server.

Alexandros (Alekos) Schinas ([tpl]lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Σχινάς[/tpl]) (1870 in Volos – May 6, 1913 in Thessaloniki),  was a GreekKing of Greece Murdered at Salonika; Slayer Mad; Political Results Feared By Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph New York Times March 19, 1913; pg. 1 anarchist who assassinated King George I of Greece in Thessaloniki in 1913.
Schinas had worked in the pantry of the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City (it closed in 1908) and a waiter remembered him as an avid reader of socialism-related literature and spending nights in Manhattan "making friends with radical and fervid thinkers".The Assassin Lived Here. Special to The New York Times. New York Times; March 20, 1913; pg. 3 Schinas was against governments and especially against aristocracy and monarchy.
He started an anarchist school in his native town which the Greek government closed for spreading anti-government ideas. Two of the leaders of the school were sentenced to prison, but Schinas escaped without being imprisoned. The authorities also seized a number of books and pamphlets published by the school, which were deemed to contain anarchist doctrine and denounced the king.King's Murderer Is Educated Anarchist, by Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph; New York Times; March 20, 1913; pg. 3
On March 18, 1913, at around 5:15 PM, Schinas (who was around 40 at the time) shot King George I in the back from a distance of two paces while the king was walking in Thessaloniki near the White Tower. Entering below the king's shoulder blade, the bullet pierced his heart and lungs and exited through his stomach. By the time the king arrived at the hospital, he was already dead.Died Before Reaching Hospital. New York Times; March 19, 1913; pg. 1
Schinas was taken into custody immediately, initially refusing to explain the reason for the crime, but when asked by an officer whether he had no "pity" for his country, he answered he was against governments. As Schinas remained calm for the entire event, there were suggestions that he was not "responsible for his actions". Later, Schinas declared that he killed the king because the latter refused to give him the money he asked for.Sorrow Throughout Greece, by Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph; New York Times; March 19, 1913; pg. 2 The Greek government released statements claiming that Schinas was an alcoholic vagrant.The Times (London); 20 March 1913; pg. 6
Schinas was tortured throughout the following night, being "forced to undergo examinations", but he refused to give the names of any accomplices.New York Times; March 20, 1913; pg. 3 On May 6, he died on falling or jumping out of the window of the gendarmerie in Thessaloniki, a fall that was reported as a suicide.King's Slayer A Suicide. New York Times; May 7, 1913; pg. 3
Various theories on the motives of Schinas circulated later, including that his action was directed by Bulgaria as a form of revenge for its lost territories, Austria-Hungary for political reasons or Germany for dynastic reasons; however, there is no evidence for any of them.Why Powers Forced Kings on Greece, by Walter Littlefield. New York Times, March 16, 1924; pg. E7

[[Razo]]
CATEGORIES: Occitan literary genres

A razo ([tpl]IPA-all|raˈzu|Old Occitan[/tpl], literally "cause", "reason") was a short piece of Occitan prose detailing the circumstances of a troubadour composition. A razo normally introduced an individual poem, acting as a prose preface and explanation; it might, however, share some of the characteristics of a vida (a biography of a troubadour, describing his origins, his loves, and his works) and the boundary between the two genres was never sharp.
In the chansonniers, the manuscript collections of medieval troubadour poetry, some poems are accompanied by a prose explanation whose purpose is to give the reason why the poem was composed. These texts are occasionally based on independent sources. To that extent, they supplement the vidas in the same manuscripts and are useful to modern literary and historical researchers. Often, however, it is clear that assertions in the razos are simply deduced from literal readings of details in the poems. Most of the surviving razo corpus is the work of Uc de Saint Circ, composed in Italy between 1227 and 1230. 
In one case, a manuscript from Bergamo, the is an explanatory rubric preceding the Occitan partimen Si paradis et enfernz son aital by Girard Cavalaz and Aycart del Fossat is in Latin.

[[Natalie Lindstrom]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional detectives, Science fiction book series, Fictional American people of Swedish descent

Natalie Lindstrom is the primary protagonist of a supernatural alternate-history detective series by Stephen Woodworth. A "Violet" with the North American Afterlife Communications Corps, she is one of a small percentage of the population born with purple irises and the ability to channel the dead, thereby allowing murder victims to testify against their killers.
Natalie is a "gaunt, pale young woman with a shaved head" and "twenty contact points tattooed on her scalp as a constellation of tiny bluish spots."  These contact points correspond to the wires of a device called a SoulScan which monitors the presence of foreign spirits in the mind of a Violet; the device is also outfitted with a red Panic Button that emits a powerful electrical burst capable of evicting hostile spirits from a hijacked conduit.  In public, Natalie wears an assortment of wigs and blue contact lenses to hide her identity.
Before going to work for the NAACC, Natalie was trained from the age of five at the Iris Semple Conduit Academy in New Hampshire by the renowned Arthur McCord, a Violet involved in the investigations of Ted Bundy and the Hillside Strangler.  By the time of Through Violet Eyes, Arthur has been in hiding for seven years (having, apparently, deserted the Academy after Natalie graduated), masquerading as a Violet-impersonating "medium" in Hollywood, and protecting himself from the bombardment of spirits by taking cover in a Faraday cage-style building.  Natalie continues to maintain secretive contact with her former teacher.
At the age of nine, Natalie dislocated her shoulder during a soccer match; at twelve, she had her head shaved like Abdullah Kobayashi and tattooed like Jun Kasai by School specialist Dr. Krell. When she was 17, her boyfriend left the School to go to work at Quantico, and insisted that she do everything necessary to avoid the same fate even if assigned.  Natalie's mother, Nora Lindstrom, was also a Violet who was ultimately driven insane by the onslaught of spirits; she was institutionalized while Natalie was still a teenager.

[[Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs]]
CATEGORIES: Auto racing organizations, Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile

Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs (CASC) was the national governing body for Canadian motorsport from 1958 to 1988.
Its origins stretched back to 1951, when three independent car clubs met in Kingston, Ontario to found the Canadian Auto Sport Committee. The name was changed to the Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs in 1958, when Regions across the country were developed. To get permits for International Races, CASC was affiliated with the Royal Automobile Club (RAC plc) of Great Britain until 1967, when it was recognized as a full member by the FIA as Canada's governing body of motorsport. The nation's motoring interests, meanwhile were represented to the FIA by the CASC's roadgoing counterpart, the CAA.
During its lifetime, CASC developed strong national series', such as the Canada Class; the original Honda Michelin series, the Players/GM Motorsport Series, and the Rothmans Porsche Cup series'. It also worked closely with its US counterpart, the SCCA, to develop and co-sanction the Can-Am, and Formula Atlantic series'.
As Canada's national governing body, CASC sanctioned such major events as the Player's 200 sports car races, the Shell 4000 rally, the 24 Hours of Mosport, and the Canadian Grand Prix, which alternated between Mosport and Circuit Mont-Tremblant.
The organization's demise came as a result of a boycott by Bernie Ecclestone's FOCA of the Canadian Grand Prix in 1987, as detailed in Terry Lovell's Ecclestone biography, Bernie's Game. CASC's FIA accreditation was revoked at the international body's next General Assembly, and its powers were instilled upon a single associate of Ecclestone's, Bernard Mailloux, until handed over to a new body, ASN Canada FIA, in 1990. Many of CASC's records were handed over to its Ontario Region, which re-affiliated as a territory to the new ASN, while other CASC regions were disbanded and replaced by re-formed territorial organizations.
Details of the CASC history can be found in the book The Chequered Past: Sports Car Racing & Rallying in Canada 1951 - 1991 by David A Charters.http://www.utppublishing.com/pubstore/merchant.ihtml?pid=8831&step=4

The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars, etc. (the licence was held by Video System at the time, who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II). The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]. This helps to add to the authenticity of the game.
The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1998 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which the player starts with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor for the players to create their own tracks.

[[Opisthothelae]]
CATEGORIES: Spider taxonomy

Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are demoted to infraorders.
The fairly recent creation of this taxon has been justified by the requirement to distinguish these spiders from the Mesothelae, which display many more primitive characteristics. Those that distinguish between Mesothelae and Opisthothelae are:
Among the Opisthothelae, the fangs of the Mygalomorphae point straight down in front of the mouth aperture and only allow the spider to grasp its prey from above and below, whereas in the Araneomorphae they face one another like pincers, allowing a firmer grip. It is difficult to distinguish araneomorphs and mygalomorphs on first inspection unless the specimens are large enough to permit immediate examination of the fangs.

The Orton-Gillingham Approach has been in use since the 1930s.  An intensive, sequential phonics-based system teaches the basics of word formation before whole meanings. The method accommodates and utilizes the three learning modalities, or pathways, through which people learn—visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Unlike some scripted and rigid reading programs, the Orton-Gillingham Approach is a system that allows for flexibility.

[[Apis nigrocincta]]
CATEGORIES: Apis (genus), Animals described in 1861

Apis nigrocincta is a species of honey bee that inhabits the Philippine island of Mindanao as well as the Indonesian islands of Sangihe and the Celebes or Sulawesi.  
The species builds nests in cavities like the closely related Apis cerana.  In fact, there are few substantial differences between the two species: the genitals of the respective drones, for instance, are identical.  However, there are small morphological differences, genetic polymorphism in the mitochondrial DNA, as well as behavioral differences.
In areas where the A. cerana and A. nigrocincta live together, they can most immediately be distinguished by their coloration and size: A. cerana tends to be darker and smaller, while A. nigrocincta tends to be larger and have a yellowish clypeus (the lower area of the face). They can best (reliably) be differentiated using morphometrics, which can also be used to identify morphologically distinct populations in both species.
The architecture of the colonies is also a point of difference: the opening of the drone cell of A. cerana is covered in wax, under which there is a conical cocoon with a central hole or pore.  In A. nigrocincta, however, the cell of the drone has a narrow opening, without a hard wax cap and hole.  In addition, the queens of A. nigrocincta generally create colonies with greater numbers of drones than those of A. cerana.
Another noticeable behavioral difference between the species is the time of day at which they prefer to gather pollen.  
A. nigrocincta contracts the parasite-caused honey bee disease Varroatosis by playing host to the species of Varroa mite known as Varroa underwoodi.  In this way, they are similar to Apis cerana nuluensis, which is also susceptible to the same species of parasite.

Pardos was the catepan of Italy briefly in 1042 following the short term of  George Maniakes. 
In July 1042, Maniakes was disgraced and recalled by Constantine IX Monomachos at the behest of Romanus Sclerus, brother of the emperor's mistress. According to Johannes Skylitzes, Romanus had even raped Maniakes' wife. In September 1042,The year is given as 1043 by Lupus Protospatharius, but he begins his year in September. Pardo arrived with an army at Otranto to take over command from Maniakes. According to Lupus Protospatharius, he brought a chrysobull, but the meaning of this is uncertain.Chalandon, p. 103 (n8). Pardos was accompanied by Nicholas, Archbishop of Bari, who, though under the jurisdiction of the Roman see, was apparently a Byzantine loyal, and by Tubaki, a protospatharius. It is probable that the archbishop had joined the catepan in a prior landing, during which the Greeks had negotiated with the Lombard rebel leader Argyrus. Subsequently, Argyrus abandoned the Lombard cause for the Greek. Pardos and Tubaki were arrested at Otranto, however, and executed by Maniakes, who was acclaimed emperor by his troops.

Silent Woods ([tpl]lang-cs|Klid[/tpl]) is the translated title of the composition by Antonín Dvořák initially published under the German title Waldesruhe.  It is the fifth part of the cycle for piano four-hands, Ze Šumavy (From the Bohemian Forest) Op.68 / B.133, composed in 1883.  The work is also transcribed by the composer for cello and piano (B.173) and for cello and orchestra (b. 182).
The original piano cycle Op. 68 was composed in 1883 on demand of Fritz Simrock.  As it was popular in the late nineteenth century to make arrangements of popular works for other instruments, on 28 December 1891 Dvořák made an arrangement for cello and piano of the fifth piece, for a farewell concert tour he gave with violinist Ferdinand Lachner and cellist Hanuš Wihan in the first months of 1892 before embarking for the New World.  The arrangement became so popular that Dvořák made a new arrangement for cello and orchestra on 28 October 1893.  The arrangements were first published in the fall of 1894 by Fritz Simrock, who changed the German title given by Dvořák – Die Ruhe (The Silence), a literal translation from the Czech Klid – to Waldesruhe (Silent Woods).
Like the other pieces in Op.68, Silent Woods is a lyrical character piece, bearing the tempo marking Lento e molto cantabile for the main, dreamy theme in D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] major, which is reprised (Lento.

Víctor González Torres (born July 1, 1947 in Mexico City), is a Mexican businessman who ran as a write-in candidate in the 2006 Mexican presidential election.[tpl]cite news|title=Se reúnen Roberto Madrazo y Víctor González |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/357672.html|accessdate=20 January 2011|newspaper=El Universal|date=25 June 2006[/tpl]  He is nicknamed "Dr. Simi"[tpl]cite news|title=Víctor González Torres, the 'Dr. Simi 'in esmas.com |url=http://www.esmas.com/portada/519375.html|accessdate=20 January 2011|newspaper=Es Mas|date=March 2006[/tpl]  after the mascot of his national drugstore franchise, Farmacias Similares. Despite not being an official candidate, he made a massive marketing campaign to enter the election. Many media outlets covered his campaign and his struggle with the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) for legitimacy, while others considered him a sort of "comic relief".[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
He is the founder and director of an associated charitable body, The Group for a Better Country (Grupo Por Un País Mejor), which seeks to provide low-cost medical services and provide a platform against official corruption. 
His franchise slogan was "The same only cheaper", and his campaign one was "To serve God and the people of Mexico". As a non-official candidate he frequently stressed the fact that he pays all of his own campaign expenses, thus being the "cheapest" candidate. He attempted to run as a candidate for the Alternativa party, whose campesino wing promoted his bid. The IFE eventually quashed his aspirations by ruling in favor of Patricia Mercado.

[[Dit da jow]]
CATEGORIES: Biologically based therapies

Dit Da Jow is a popular Chinese liniment sold to heal external damage such as bruises or sore muscles. There are several different recipes for Dit Da Jow, most of which are considered to be a "secret formula" passed down through oral and written history of Traditional Chinese medicine, martial arts, and modern Western science. Although Chinese tradition traces the origins of Chinese medicine to demigods named the Divine Plowman (Sheng Nung) and the  Yellow Emperor (Huang Ti), who are said to have lived in the early 3rd millennium B.C., the earliest available historical records of Chinese medicine are medical texts dating from the Han Dynasty via several Chinese materia medica.
Dit Da Jow is an analgesic liniment traditionally preferred by martial artists. Often a martial arts master blends his unique mixture of many aromatic herbs such as myrrh and ginseng, which are combined to stimulate circulation, reduce pain and swelling, and improve healing of injuries and wounds.Acupressure Vs Acupressure With Dit Da Jow For The Relief The tradition became known as "hit medicine". Many people have also found this sort of liquid analgesic to be useful for reducing the aching of muscles, and arthritis and rheumatism discomfort.
All bruise liniment formulas contain ingredients to stop pain, reduce swelling and inflammation, and disperse stagnant qi and blood. It is composed of cooling herbs to reduce swelling and inflammation; and warming herbs that kill pain, promote circulation, and break up accumulations of stagnant blood and fluids.
Herbs in the formulas according to TCM use "temperature" and "action". with each herb exhibiting an "energy" that has an effect on the body. Some are cold while others are hot. The overall combination of herbs in a Dit Da Jow formula determines its relative energy. Warmer jow is more often used in conditioning or chronic injury while cooler jow is more likely to be used for new injuries that may be inflamed. The action of each herb has specific uses. A Dit Da Jow should have one or two primary actions, determined by the herbs which are used in the Dit Da Jow formula.dit da jow - Herb Research PlumDragon Herbs 
Today Dit Da Jow can be bought online and through martial arts catalogs or it can be directly obtained from a Chinese apothecary or master. Dit Da Jow is primarily used by martial artists to aid the healing of Iron Palm training.
If you purchase Dit Da Jow already made, it is best that you purchase it bottled in glass and not plastic. Authentic Dit Da Jow that contains herbs like camphor, frankincense and myrrh, combined with alcohol can leach the chemicals from the plastic bottle and contaminate the liniment, making it totally useless or dangerous.Dit Da Jow - TCM and Sports Injury Medicine East Meets West Intl
When you purchase the herbs to make your own Dit Da Jow, a glass jar or plastic that is made from PETE, and an alcohol medium like vodka or gin is used. Centuries ago Dit Da Jow was made by combining the herbs in a clay vessel and adding rice wine, then burying the vessel in the ground for months or even years; the longer the herbs sat in the alcohol, the stronger the Dit Da Jow became.

Musa Qala is a district in the north of Helmand Province, Afghanistan.UNHCR District Profile, dated 2002-12-31, accessed 2006-08-01 (PDF).
Its population was around 50,300 in 2005 and are 97% ethnic Pashtun. The district centre is the village of Musa Qala; there are 19 other large villages and 200 smaller settlements, mostly along the Musa Qala River. The area is irrigated by the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority.(pdf) The Helmand Valley Project in Afghanistan: A.I.D. Evaluation Special Study No. 18 C Clapp-Wicek & E Baldwin, U.S. Agency for International Development, published December 1983
NATO-led International Security Assistance Force extended its presence to this region in mid-2006. Musa Qala, along with the rest of Helmand, was to be under the responsibility of British forces.
The village of Musa Qala was the scene of fierce fighting between British Pathfinder Platoon troops and Taliban insurgents during the summer of 2006. The British had set up a stronghold in the local governor's office and faced daily waves of determined attacks. The British garrison was later relieved by a Danish infantry team who faced renewed insurgent attacks, culminating in better trained militant fighters equipped with rockets and mortars. After a month of these attacks the fighting died down and the Danish forces handed control of the base back to British forces. On 17 October 2006, after a 35-day lull in violence, the British left the village, handing over control to the local elders' council.

He lived in Baghdad, until he was invited to Rey, in 367 AH/978 CE, by its governor, a staunch supporter of the Mu'tazila. He was appointed chief Qadi of the province. On the death of Ibn 'Abbad, he was deposed and arrested by the ruler, Fakhr al-Dawla, because of a slighting remark made by him about his deceased benefactor. He died later in 415 AH/1025 CE.
His comprehensive "summa" of speculative theology, the Mughni, presented Mu`tazili thought under the two headings of God's oneness (tawhid) and his justice (adl). He argued that the Ash'arite separation between the eternal speech of God and the created words of the Qur'an made God's will unknowable.

Morlacco or Morlacco di Grappa originates from Mount Grappa (provinces of Vicenza, Treviso and Belluno in Italy) where cheesemakers once produced a soft cow's milk cheese, low in fat, with an uncooked curd that was named after their native region: Morlacchia. 
The local Burlina cows - a breed that is at risk of extinction - produced the milk used for this cheese. The Burlina cow is small and hardy and has a piebald black and white coat. 
Today, Morlacco di Grappa cheese is once again produced on Mount Grappa with skimmed milk from the evening’s milking mixed with whole milk from that of the morning. After 20 days of aging, the cheese is ready for consumption, but it can be left to age for up to three months.

[[Teleport Communications Group]]

CATEGORIES: Telecommunications companies of the United States

Teleport Communications Group (TCG) was the first Competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in the U.S.
It was formed as Teleport Communications in 1985 by Merrill Lynch as the private sector participant in the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's "Teleport Project."  The Teleport Project envisioned a satellite earth station complex in Staten Island connected to the stock exchanges, financial services companies and corporate headquarters located in Manhattan.  Microwave connections were not feasible due to the congestion of New York's airwaves so Teleport Communications decided to utilize fiber optics for a network connecting satellite earth stations at The Teleport to customers in Manhattan.  However, the simultaneous advent of national fiber optic networks reduced the need for satellite communications, leaving Teleport Communications' network largely unused. Merrill Lynch hired former AT&T manager Robert Annunziata to develop a new strategy for Teleport Communications.  Annunziata's plan was revolutionary:  Teleport Communications would use the fiber optic network to compete with the New York Telephone Company, the historic monopoly telephone company in New York, and re-introduce competition for local telecom services.
Teleport Communications' service was very popular with long distance carriers such as AT&T, MCI and Sprint who wanted to connect their long distance networks to their largest customers without using the local telephone companies (the so-called regional Bell Operating Companies--RBOCs) which were perceived as strategic competitors that wanted to get into the long distance business.  Teleport Communications' services were also popular with financial services companies that wanted duplicate and independent high speed connections between their New York area offices and the stock exchanges.
The financial services and long distance companies quickly asked Teleport Communications to replicate its services in Boston.  Merrill Lynch formed a partnership with Fidelity Investments for Teleport Communications-Boston.  Similar expansions followed in Chicago, San Francisco, Houston and other major cities across the United States and the company was re-christened Teleport Communications Group (TCG).  Merrill Lynch later sold TCG to the cable TV industry, with Cox initially taking a 20% ownership. The remaining 80% was subsequently sold to TCI, Comcast and Continental Cablevision. TCG and the cable companies then started to deploy jointly built fiber optic networks in many other cities. TCG then added carrier-grade Class 5 switches to the fiber optic networks to become the first and largest Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC), competing broadly with the traditional local telephone companies.
Critical to TCG's ability to compete with the traditional monopolies were a series of favorable decisions by state regulators, particularly in New York, Massachusetts and Illinois, which allowed TCG and other CLECs to interconnect as "peers" at reasonable rates.  These regulatory initiatives were ultimately codified and made applicable nationally through the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.[ref]
.

[/ref]  The success of TCG and other CLECs demonstrated that competition was possible in the local telephone market.  This contributed to the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which eased the entrance of new CLECs by requiring the incumbent telephone companies, the largest being legacies of AT&T, to interconnect with the new entrants. The company has since merged with AT&T.
In 1998, TCG was acquired by AT&T for $12 billion.  At that time the publicly traded TCG (NASDAQ, TCGI) served 65 markets and generated $800 million in revenue.  Its largest investors were Cable Television companies TCI, Comcast and Cox Communications.
Testaments to TCG continue to exist through former employees in the form of a TCG alumni site and a Facebook 'fan' page.[ref]

[[Stephen Salant]]

CATEGORIES: American economists, Columbia University alumni, University of Pennsylvania alumni, University of Michigan faculty, Living people

Stephen Salant is an economist who has done extensive research in applied microeconomics (mostly in the fields of natural resources and industrial organization). His 1975 model of speculative attacks in the gold market (with Dale Henderson) was adapted by Paul Krugman and others to explain speculative attacks in foreign exchange markets. Hundreds of journal articles and books on financial speculative attacks followed. 
In a series of six articles,"Market anticipations of government policies and the price of gold" (with Dale Henderson),  Journal of Political Economy 1978, 86, pp.627-48"The vulnerability of price stabilization schemes to speculative attack," Journal of Political Economy 1983, 91, pp.1-38"Recurrence of a modified random walk and its application to an economic model" (with Roberta Wenocur), SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics, 1981, pp. 163-66"Private storage of common property" (with Gerard Gaudet and Michel Moreaux), Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 2002, 43, pp. 280-302"The effects of periodic quotas limiting the stock of imports of durables" (with Gerard Gaudet), Journal of Economic Theory, 2003,109,pp.402-19"The proposed cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissiions: the case of the unbuttoned collar" (with Makoto Hasegawa), 2010 Salant has continued to focus instead on real speculative attacks. These may be divided into two categories: (1) speculative attacks induced by government policies such as total allowable catch quotas in fisheries, H1-B immigration quotas, commodity price ceilings, and most recently the proposed price-collars on tradable emissions permits; and (2) speculative attacks that are naturally occurring rather than induced by government policy such as the precipitous depletions of storable common properties (e.g. “oil rushes”). 
In industrial organization, he has contributed to the literatures on horizontal mergers, price discrimination, durable goods monopoly, and cartels.
Salant also has a long-standing interest in the Alger Hiss case and has published in that area as well. 
He earned his B.A. in mathematics at Columbia University in 1967, and his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973. He worked at the Federal Reserve Board and the Rand Corporation, where he coedited the Rand Journal of Economics. Currently, Dr. Salant is Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan and a nonresident fellow at Resources for the Future.

Ferdinando Bertoni (15 August 1725 – 1 December 1813) was an Italian composer and organist.
He was born in Salò, and began his music studies in Brescia, not far from his birthplace. Around 1740 he went to Bologna, where he studied till 1745 with the famous music theorist Giovanni Battista Martini. Then he moved to Venice, where in 1752 he was appointed as first organist at San Marco.  From 1755 to 1777 he was choirmaster at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti, also in Venice. In the period 1778–1783 he was in London, where he composed operas for the King's Theatre. Back to Venice in 1784, he succeeded Baldassare Galuppi in 1785 as Kapellmeister of  San Marco and preserved this position until his retirement in 1808.  He died in Desenzano del Garda.
A prolific writer of church music, Bertoni also composed 70 operas which fell into oblivion, except Orfeo (Venice, Teatro San Benedetto, 1776), based on the same libretto of Ranieri de' Calzabigi of  the work of Christoph Willibald Gluck, Orfeo ed Euridice (Burgtheater, Vienna, 1762). Bertoni composed this work especially for his friend Gaetano Guadagni, a castrato, who would interpret the role of Orfeo (the same role he had interpreted in Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice). Bertoni generally ignored Gluck's reforms and composed the work in the old style of opera seria.
Bertoni composed at least 200 sacred works (including about 50 oratorios) and cantatas, instrumental work and chamber music.

He has designed speakers and sound equipment such as the MicroWedge, which is manufactured by Eastern Acoustic Works and is now a familiar monitor wedge on many worldwide tours.
Dave Rat wrote a column for Live Sound International magazine entitled, "Rat Tales" in the November 2006 issue and another in the May 2007 issue.http://www.livesoundint.com/
On May 22, 2006 Dave Rat started a blog entitled "Roadies In The Midst" on the Rat Sound Systems Inc. website chronicling his experiences as Front of House sound engineer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their Stadium Arcadium tour. He has acted as their Front of House (FOH) engineer for the past 19 years. The tour ended in August 2007. However, Dave continues to post entries discussing the adjustment back to normal life.  He went back out as Front of House engineer for the Blink 182 Reunion Tour and likewise chronicles his exploits on that long-running arena and amphitheater tour in 2009. On May 15, 2011, Dave announced through his Twitter page that rehearsals were underway for the upcoming Red Hot Chili Peppers tour, which is expected to last two years.
In December 2005 Dave innovated a unique sound system design based on two side-by-side speaker systems that he called The Double Hung PA. The outer stereo speakers reproduced guitar, bass, toms and cymbals and the inner speakers reproduced vocals, kick and snare.  Since no single instrument or vocal was sent to both systems, comb filtering and interference issues were avoided while system clarity was increased. Red Hot Chili Peppers toured with the Double Hung System for the duration of Stadium Arcadium tour. In July 2008, the Brazil based sound company Gabisom implemented the side-by-side PA concept for the Rock in Rio festival in Portugal and in 2009 Pennsylvania based sound company Clair Brothers, provided touring artists U2 with an in-the-round stadium sized sound system, based on the same double hung PA concept.
In 2009 Dave began working on a several steerable sub woofer array concepts which he implemented on the Blink 182 reunion tour.  The Vortex, Slotfire and V-Fire configurations describe methods of arranging and delaying conventional sub woofers such that low frequency sound bleed onto stage is reduced and horizontal subwoofer coverage to the audience is steerable.
Dave worked with Soundgarden in the Summer of 2011 on their North American tour. Following that, Rat worked with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their 2011-13 I'm with You tour and the band's 2013-14 tour that followed.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ratsound.com/cblog/|title=Here We Go|publisher=http://www.ratsound.com/cblog/[/tpl]

The Jäger Report was written on 1 December 1941 by Karl Jäger, commander of Einsatzkommando 3, a killing unit of Einsatzgruppen A which was attached to Army Group North during Operation Barbarossa. It is the most precise surviving chronicle of the activities of one individual Einsatzkommando.
The Jäger Report is a tally sheet of actions by Einsatzkommando 3, including the Rollkommando Hamann killing squad. The report keeps an almost daily running total of the liquidations of 137,346 people, the vast majority Jews, from 2 July 1941 to 25 November 1941. The report documents exact date and place of the massacres, number of victims and their breakdown into categories (Jews, communists, criminals, etc.). In total, there were over 100 executions in 71 different locations listed there. On 1 February 1942, Jäger updated the totals to 136,421 Jews (46,403 men, 55,556 women and 34,464 children), 1,064 Communists, 653 mentally disabled, and 134 others in a handwritten note for Franz Walter Stahlecker.
The six-page report was prepared in five copies, but only one survives and is kept by the Central Lithuanian Archives in Vilnius.Messages of Murder by Ronald Headland

NBA Hangtime is a basketball video game published & developed by Midway and released in arcades in 1996. Home versions followed for Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, and Windows. A version for Game.com was cancelled.
Hangtime was the third basketball game by the original development team behind the NBA Jam series. The title was changed due to the NBA Jam name being acquired by Acclaim Entertainment—the publisher of the games for the home market. Acclaim's NBA Jam Extreme was released the same year as Hangtime. Features introduced in Hangtime included character creation, alley oops and double dunks.  A software update known as NBA Maximum Hangtime was released for the arcades later in the life cycle.
The ending of Maximum Hangtime promises a new, 3-D basketball title from Midway, which was eventually released as NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC.

They speak the Yaghnobi language, a living Eastern Iranian language (the other living members being Pashto, Ossetic and the Pamir languages). Yaghnobi is spoken in the upper valley of the Yaghnob River in the Zarafshan area of Tajikistan by the Yaghnobi people. It is considered to be a direct descendant of Sogdian and has often been called Neo-Sogdian in academic literature.Bielmeier. R.  Yaghnobi in Encyclopedia Iranica
The 1926  and 1939 census data gives the number of Yaghnobi language speakers as approximately 1,800. In 1955, M. Bogolyubov estimated the number of Yaghnabi native speakers as more than 2,000.

George Allen Frazier (born October 13, 1954 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma), is a former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1978–1987, primarily as a set-up reliever.
Frazier played high school baseball as a member of "the Hornets", which is the name of the teams at Hillcrest High School in Springfield, Missouri. Frazier was offered a college scholarship in baseball, football, and basketball.
In 1981 while with the Yankees, Frazier tied a World Series record with 3 losses (with Lefty Williams). Williams, however, is widely suspected to have thrown those games in the 1919 World Series (as part of the Black Sox Scandal), and furthermore, the third game Williams lost was Game Eight - the Series of 1919 through 1921 were best of nine affairs, leaving Frazier as the only pitcher to lose three games in a best of seven World Series.
Frazier later appeared in the 1987 World Series as a member of the Twins.
Frazier currently serves as a television commentator for the Colorado Rockies organization. His son, Parker Frazier was drafted in the eighth round of the 2007 MLB Draft by the Colorado Rockies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]

[[Derveni, Corinthia]]
CATEGORIES: Populated places in Corinthia

Derveni (Δερβένι) is a coastal town in Corinthia in the Peloponnese peninsula, Greece. It was the seat of the former municipality Evrostina. 
Its population stands at 1514 but rises dramatically during the holiday season and many of the houses and flats are second residencies to people living mostly in Athens (142 km) or Patras (73 km). Its nearest main town is Corinth (50 km). One of its main characteristics is that its coastal houses and flats are flanked by the old national road to the south and give directly onto the pebbled sea shore to the north. Due to its restricted parking facilities and the infrequent train service, it is not a stop-over town for passing traffic, or amenable to day trips.
Its name derives from its geographical location, squeezed between the mountains and the deep Corinthian Sea. Derven means narrow passage or path in Ottoman Turkish. It was founded early 19th century by inhabitants of the nearby village of Zacholi who exported and processed raisins. Its trading apogee came between 1923–1940 when hundreds of workers processed the so-called Corinth raisins that arrived by boat on its small port. The port no longer exists.
It is linked by rail to Athens and Patras.

The Kroisos Kouros is central to two ongoing archeological debates: first, whether kouroi represented specific young men or were generic representations of idealized archetypes which might not actually resemble a specific person commemorated, and thus are symbolic representations embodying the ideal of the male warrior en promáchois (ἐν προμάχοις), "in the front line" of battle, not naturalistic ones; and second the authenticity of the Getty kouros, which bears a falsified provenance and displays a suspicious similarity to the Kroisos kouros.Marion True. The Getty Kouros: Background on the Problem, in The Getty Kouros Colloquium, 1993, p. 13.

[[Euphorbia atropurpurea]]
CATEGORIES: Euphorbia

Euphorbia atropurpurea, called tabaiba majorera or tabaiba roja in Spanish, is a shrub in the family Euphorbiaceae native to Tenerife in the Canary Islands. It can reach 2 metres in height, and grows in ravines, and on slopes and terraces.
The plant grows best in humid conditions in mid to low altitudes (300-1,200 m) on the south and west parts of the island. It is plentiful in the towns of Teno, Santiago del Teide, and the slope of Güímar.
The shrub can reach over 2 m with stems and succulent branches without spines. It has large bluish green leaves, which form a rosette at the end of the branches. The plant flowers from winter to spring (December to May). The flowers have dark red bracts greater than 1 cm in size. These bracts lend the plant its name, atropurpurea (from the Latin ater or "black", and purple). It should not be confused with E. bravoana, which is endemic to the nearby island of La Gomera and also has purple-red bracts. The fruit is a red capsule with three dark brown seeds. 
Like other plants in the genus Euphorbia, it produces a toxic white latex if cut.
E. atropurpurea is used as an ornamental plant in gardens for its eye-catching appearance and flowers. It requires little care, but requires sunlight and a certain amount of environmental humidity. It generally spreads by seeds, or more rarely by simply branching out.
In the area of Masca, in Tenerife, hybrids between E. atropurpurea and Euphorbia regis-jubae occur, which the Swedish botanist Eric Ragnor Sventenius named Euphorbia navae in honour of Alonso de Nava y Grimón, founder of the Botanical Garden of La Orotava.

Ronald Lindley ("Ron") Meek (27 July 1917 – 18 August 1978) was a Marxian economist and social scientist known especially for his scholarly studies of classical political economy and the labour theory of value.
Meek was born in Wellington, New Zealand, where he attended school and entered Victoria University in the mid-1930s, initially to study law, and later economics. There he became interested in the thought of Karl Marx, theatre and local left-wing politics. Some of his articles of that period in New Zealand journals like Spike, Salient and Tomorrow were written under pseudonyms. In 1939, he graduated with a Masters in Law. In 1944, he married a communist activist, Rona Stephenson (better known as Rona Bailey) though they were soon divorced again. Meek revealed himself to be the brightest Marxian thinker of his generation in New Zealand; his first monograph, a pamphlet called "Maori Problems Today" (1943) discussed a topic which had previously been largely ignored by the Communist Party of New Zealand.
In 1946 Meek moved to Cambridge, England with a Strathcona studentship to read for a Ph.D. under Piero Sraffa and Maurice Dobb. Two years later, in October 1948, he moved to Glasgow, Scotland where he became university lecturer in the Department of Political Economy, and in 1949 he finished his doctoral thesis, "The development of the concept of surplus in economic thought from Mun to Mill". He also remarried and learnt to play the piano.
His first major work, Studies in the Labour Theory of Value, was published by Lawrence & Wishart in 1956. In the same year he quit the Communist Party of Great Britain and he abandoned his previous support for the policies of Joseph Stalin, although he continued to be a Marxist until his last years. He was acknowledged to be a scholarly authority on Adam Smith and on the Physiocrats.
In 1963 he was appointed to the Tyler Chair of Economics at the University of Leicester, where he initiated a B.Sc. course in Economics and a Public Sector Economics Research Centre. He published numerous books and articles on classical political economy, Marxian and Sraffian economics, as well as on electricity pricing and social theory.

Rütli ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈryːtli[/tpl]) or Grütli ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɡʁytli|lang[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-it|ˈɡrutli|lang[/tpl]) is a mountain meadow on Lake Lucerne, in the Seelisberg municipality of the Swiss canton of Uri. Here the legendary oath of the Rütlischwur first occurred and is remembered as the turning-point in the pursuit of independence. Every August 1, on the Swiss National Day, the oath is re-enacted to commemorate the forming of the Old Swiss Confederacy. 
Land forming the Rütli meadow was bought by the Schweizerische Gemeinnützige Gesellschaft in 1859 in order to preserve its state and, among other reasons, to prohibit the construction of a hotel at the historical site. This non-profit company turned the Rütli over to the government as an inalienable gift.
On July 25, 1940, General Guisan used the site for his speech, now remembered as the "Rütlirapport", to all commanding officers of the Swiss army in which he outlined the Reduit strategy and his aim never to surrender if invaded (see Switzerland during the World Wars).
Since 1991, Rütli has also been the start of the "Swiss Way" hiking trail created to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Switzerland.

They are built in a neighborhood to provide internet access to residents in the community, often using rooftop antennas in a hub-and-spoke arrangement to bridge the last few hundred feet to the residences (or possibly businesses).[tpl]cite web|last=Brazil|first=Karla Mae|title=Neighborhood Internet Service Provider|url=http://guide-to-isp.com/internet-access/neighborhood-internet-service-provider-nisp/|work=guide-to-isp.com|accessdate=19 March 2014[/tpl] Such a network requires a local network engineer (often a volunteer) to maintain network integrity and monitor the quality of service.
There are firms that will install and maintain such a network, but there are other options.  For instance, a loosely knit community might use WiFi mesh to connect collectively owned access points.

[[Regulatory Reform Act 2001]]

CATEGORIES: United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 2001, Economics of regulation, Legal reform

The Regulatory Reform Act 2001 (c.6) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It replaced the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. It removed some of the constraints on Deregulation Orders under the 1994 Act, by providing wider powers for government ministers to make a Regulatory Reform Order by statutory instrument.
The Act was introduced to the House of Lords on 7 December 2000, and passed to the House of Commons on 19 March 2001. It passed its Report Stage and Third Reading on 5 April 2001.
Under the 2001 Act, a government minister can make a Regulatory Reform Order to "reform legislation which has the effect of imposing burdens", with a view to removing or reducing the regulatory burdens. The Act can only be used to reform existing legislation, so cannot be used to codify the common law, and can only be used where burdens are removed (although, unlike the 1994 Act, new burdens can also be imposed where proportional). An Order cannot be used to remove "necessary protections". The draft Order must be opened to public consultation, reviewed by Committees from both Houses of Parliament, and then approved by both Houses of Parliament. However, they are not debated on the floor of either chamber, unlike a Bill.
The Act provided for four Deregulation Orders that were moving through the approval process to be completed. Between enactment in April 2001 and July 2005, the Act was used to pass 27 Regulatory Reform Orders. For example, to make orders to remove restrictions on business tenancies; to liberalise rules on gaming machines; to extend licensing hours for New Year's Eve 2001; and, for the Queen's Golden Jubilee, to remove the 20-partner limit on partnerships, and to rationalise legislation on fire safety.
The Act has been largely replaced Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. The Act expands the range of ministerial order-making powers, allowing orders to be made in a wider range of circumstances, more quickly and efficiently, with less consultation and scrutiny.

[[Bodindecha]]
CATEGORIES: People from Bangkok, 1777 births, 1849 deaths

Chao Phraya Bodindecha ([tpl]lang-th|เจ้าพระยาบดินทรเดชา[/tpl], personal name Sing Singhaseni, [tpl]lang|th|สิงห์ สิงหเสนี[/tpl] 1777–1849) was one of the most prominent political and military figures of the early Bangkok Rattanakosin Kingdom.  Bodindecha was both a top military general ([tpl]lang|th|แม่ทัพใหญ่[/tpl]) and  Chief Minister in charge of civilian affairs as the Akkhra Maha Senabodi ([tpl]lang|th|อัครมหาเสนาบดี[/tpl]) of the Samuha Nayok [tpl]lang|th|สมุหนายก[/tpl]) during the reign of King Rama III. He was known for putting down the Laotian Rebellion (1826–1828} (ปราบกบฎ) of Lord Anouvong of Vientiane (เจ้าอนุวงศ์ เวียงจันทน์) and for campaigns during the Siamese-Vietnamese Wars of 1831–1834 and 1841–1845.
Sing was born in 1777 in Bangkok during the Thonburi Kingdom period to Chao Phraya Abhayraja (Pin) and Lady Fug. Abhayraja sent Sing under service to Prince Isarasundhorn, the heir apparent. The prince was later crowned as Buddha Loetla Nabhalai and Sing was made a minor official, during which time he became acquainted with Prince Chetsadabodin. Prince Chetsadabodin was crowned as Rama III in 1824 and Sing was made Phraya Ratchasuphawadi. 
In 1826, Anouvong the King of Vientiene led the Laotian Rebellion against the Bangkok government. King Rama III sent his uncle (and titular heir-apparent) Maha Sakdi Polsep to Isan, accompanied by Sing (as Phraya Ratchasuphawadi)  to suppress the rebellion ([tpl]lang|th|ปราบกบฎ[/tpl], literally, "adjust" rebel.) The campaign earned Sing royal favor and he was elevated from Phraya to Chao Phraya Ratchasuphawadi and made Chief Minister in charge of civilian affairs. Rama III later granted Sing the special title Bodindecha ([tpl]lang|th|บดินทรเดชา[/tpl]) made up from parts of the king's own princely title, Chetsadabodin ([tpl]lang|th|เจษฏาบดินทร์[/tpl]).
As chancellor, Bodindecha had full responsibility during the Siamese-Vietnamese War in Cambodia from 1841 to 1845. The two countries had long been quarreling over Cambodia, and in 1841 Rama III sent Siamese armies under Bodindecha to put Prince Ang Duong on the Cambodian throne. Bodindecha was able to take Udongk and Phnom Penh. A peace was negotiated in 1845 and Ang Duong put on the throne. Bodindecha stayed in Cambodia until 1848 when he returned to Siam and died a year later of cholera.

[[Plucked string instrument]]

CATEGORIES: String instruments

Plucked string instruments are a subcategory of string instruments that are played by plucking the strings. Plucking is a way of pulling and releasing the string in such a way as to give it an impulse that causes the string to vibrate. Plucking can be done with either a finger or a plectrum.
Most plucked string instruments belong to the lute family (such as guitar, bass guitar, mandolin, banjo, balalaika, sitar, pipa, etc.), which generally consist of a resonating body, and a neck; the strings run along the neck and can be stopped at different pitches. The zither family (including the autoharp, kantele, gusli, kannel, kankles, kokle, koto, guqin, gu zheng and many others) does not have a neck, and the strings are stretched across the soundboard. In the harp family (including the lyre), the strings are perpendicular to the soundboard and do not run across it. The harpsichord does not fit any of these categories but is also a plucked string instrument, as its strings are struck with a plectrum when the keys are depressed.
Bowed string instruments, such as the violin, can also be plucked in the technique known as pizzicato; however, as they are usually played with a bow, they are not included in this category. Struck string instruments (such as the piano) can be similarly plucked as an extended technique.
Plucked string instruments are not a category in the Sachs-Hornbostel classification, as some of them are simple chordophones and others are composite (depending on whether the resonator is a removable part of the instrument).

[[Hood baronets]]

CATEGORIES: Baronetcies, 1778 establishments in Great Britain, 1809 establishments in the United Kingdom, Hood family

There have been three baronetcies created for people with the surname Hood, one in the Baronetage of Great Britain and two in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. The first Baronet of the first creation was created Viscount Hood while the fourth Baronet of the second creation was made Baron St Audries.
The Hood Baronetcy, of Catherington, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 20 May 1778 for the naval commander Samuel Hood. He was later elevated to the peerage as Viscount Hood. For more information, see this title.
The Hood Baronetcy, of St Audries in the County of Somerset, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 13 April 1809 for Samuel Hood, with remainder to his nephew Alexander Hood and the heirs male of his body. Hood was the grandson of Alexander Hood, uncle of Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood and Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet. He represented Somerset West in the House of Commons. His son, the third Baronet, married Isabel Harriet Fuller-Palmer-Acland, daughter and heir of Sir Peregrine Fuller-Palmer-Acland, 2nd Baronet, of Fairfield, in 1849, and assumed by Royal license the additional surnames of Fuller and Acland. He later sat as a Member of Parliament for Somerset West.
His son, the fourth Baronet, succeeded in 1905 to the Bateman Baronetcy of Hartington Hall according to a special remainder in the letters patent. Fuller-Acland-Hood also represented Wellington in Parliament and held minor office from 1902 to 1905 in the Conservative government of Arthur Balfour. On 22 January 1911 he was created Baron St Audries, of St Audries in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony became extinct on 16 October 1971 on the death of his son, the second Baron, while the baronetcies are thought to have passed to the latter's cousin, the sixth Baronet, of St Audries, and eighth Baronet, of Hartington Hall. He was the son of younger son of the third Baronet. However, he never successfully proved his succession and was never on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. On his death in 1990 the titles are considered to have become either extinct or dormant. As of 2006 they are officially listed as dormant by the Standing Council of the Baronetage (for more information follow this link).
The Hood Baronetcy, of Wimbledon in the County of Surrey, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 16 January 1922 for Joseph Hood, who represented Wimbledon in the House of Commons as a Conservative. As of 30 June 2006 the presumed third holder of the title has not successfully proved his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the Baronetcy considered dormant.

The Battle of Ningyuan ([tpl]zh|s=宁远之战|t=寧遠之戰|p=Níngyuǎn Zhī Zhàn|y=Ning4 Yun5 Ji1 Jin3[/tpl]) was a battle between the Ming Dynasty and the Manchurian Later Jin in 1626. The Ming won this battle. This battle marked the temporary resurgence of the Imperial Ming army after a long series of defeats.[tpl]cite book|year=1977|publisher=Simon and Schuster|quote=In February, 1626, however, his troops were repulsed at Ningyuan, and eight months later Nurhaci died. |location=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ORBmFSFcJKoC&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=78|pages=|title=The fall of imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Frederic E. Wakeman|accessdate=2012-03-02[/tpl]
Before 1626, the Imperial Ming army had been very badly defeated by the Manchus. Part of the Imperial Ming army's new strategy of defense after defeat was to develop Ningyuan into a military stronghold. Yuan Chonghuan, with the support of Sun Chengzong, was seriously strengthening the defense of Ningyuan in anticipation of a Manchu attack.
After Sun Chengzong was replaced by a new commander, the new commander ordered all Ming Forces outside the Great Wall to retreat inside and abandon all land outside Shanhai Pass. Yuan Chonghuan objected stronglly and was thus left to command a lone army guarding Ningyuan (modern-day Xingcheng, Liaoning).
In 1626 Kundulun Khan Nurhaci, seeing all Ming forces leaving, decided to advance towards Ningyuan, personally leading a force of 100,000-130,000 (At least 60,000) (Nurhaci boasted an unrealistic 200,000).
Yuan Chonghuan had only 10,000 men under his command. He burnt everything outside Ningyuan and wrote an essay of defiance against Jin in his own blood; he also sent orders to guards at the Great Wall to execute any deserters from Ningyuan, thus greatly boosting City's morale.
20 days later, the Jin army arrived and immediately attacked the city. However, after two days of intense fighting, the citizens and soldiers of Ningyuan inflicted heavy losses on the Jin forces and Nurhaci himself was wounded by cannon fire and decided to retreat.[tpl]cite book|year=1977|publisher=Simon and Schuster|quote=Abahai also realized how important it was to use Chinese military experts against the Ming forces. The great victories of 1618 and 1621 had placed eastern Manchuria under the Latter Chin's rule. But further expansion down the Liao-hsi coast toward the Great Wall had been blocked by the Ming commander, Yuan Ch'ung-huan, whose Portuguese artillery had repulsed Nurhaci at Ningyuan in 1626. |location=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ORBmFSFcJKoC&pg=PA79&dq=Li+was+made+a+banner+general,+was+given+gifts+of+slaves+and+serfs,+and+was+betrothed+to+a+young+woman+of+the+Aisin+Gioro+clan.+Although+Li#v=onepage&q=military%20experts%20yuan%20ch'ung-huan%20repulsed%20vulnerable%20castle%20walls&f=false|page=78|pages=|title=The fall of imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Frederic E. Wakeman|accessdate=2012-03-02[/tpl]
While retreating, Yuan Chonghuan chased the other and inflicted even more losses on the Jin army.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]
Nurhaci retreated back to Mukden and died from his wounds. His eighth son or the fourth Beilei (lord) Hung Taiji assumed the title of the Great Khan of the Later Jin Khanate. The Imperial Ming army adopted the same strategy of developing Jinzhou, which is further north of Ningyuan, into another military stronghold. Ningyuan became the headquarters of the Imperial Ming army with Yuan Chonghuan stationed there. Hung Taiji, like his father, was defeated in the Second Battle of Ningyuan about one year later. Then Hong Taiji plotted the death of Yuan Chonghuan.
On the whole, the Manchus did not manage to break the defense of the Ningyuan garrison even after the death of Yuan Chonghuan. However, in 1644, the Ming emperor ordered the Ningyuan garrison to give up Ningyuan and come to Beijing to fight a very strong rebel army. Before the Ningyuan garrison arrived, Beijing fell to the rebel army and the Ming emperor committed suicide. Subsequently, the Manchus defeated the rebel army and then after many more years of war conquered the whole China.

The Strachey Baronetcy, of Sutton Court in the County of Somerset, England, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=15372 |date=2 June 1801 |startpage=619[/tpl] It was created on 15 June 1801 for the politician and civil servant Henry Strachey. His great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, was a Liberal politician. On 3 November 1911 he was created Baron Strachie, of Sutton Court in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=28547 |date=3 November 1911 |startpage=7952[/tpl] He later served as Paymaster-General. The peerage became extinct on the death of his son, the second Baron, in 1973. The late Baron was succeeded in the baronetcy by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baronet. He was the son of John Strachey, son and namesake of John Strachey, second son of the third Baronet. Strachey does not use his title. Also, as of 2007 he has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant.Baronetcies to which no       Succession has been proved, The        Standing Council of the Baronetage.
Several other members of the Strachey family have also gained distinction. John Strachey, grandfather of the first Baronet, was a noted geologist, while his father, John Strachey (died 1674), was a friend of John Locke. Edward Strachey, second son of the first Baronet, was the father of 1) the civil servant John Strachey, and 2) Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Strachey, who was the father of Lytton Strachey, James Strachey, Oliver Strachey and Dorothy Bussy. The aforementioned John Strachey, second son of the third Baronet, was a noted journalist, while his son John Strachey was a Labour politician. Another son of the third Baronet, Henry Strachey, was a painter and art critic.
The family surname is pronounced "Stray-chee".

[[Pop Vultures]]

CATEGORIES: American radio programs

Pop Vultures was a short-lived radio program hosted by Kate Sullivan, a Los Angeles-based journalist, and produced by Prairie Home Productions and American Public Media. 
A Prairie Home Companion auteur Garrison Keillor conceived of Pop Vultures as a way to educate public radio listeners about the world of pop music.  The half-hour show featured rock journalist Kate Sullivan as host, chatting with a rotating cast of friends, musicians and critics about all genres and manifestations of pop, from glam to hip-hop to Christian rock.  Independent producer Jay Allison and This American Life host Ira Glass were among its champions.  Glass said of Sullivan, "She is at the Sarah Vowell, David Sedaris level, in the way that she's utterly suited to radio.  That's really, really hard to find."Janssen, Mike, "With Vultures, Keillor Hips His Peers to Pop," Current.org. Originally published in Current, June 21, 2004  Allison said, "Kate Sullivan and the team at Pop Vultures certainly appeal to the fabled Younger Demographic, but we like them because they sound alive and knowledgeable and profoundly into what they're doing and they're funny.  Those qualities seem good ones for public radio to take forward."Jay Allison, The Transom Review Volume 4/Issue 4
Pop Vultures was in development for over two years; a pilot season of 22 episodes aired on public radio stations nationally, including KUOW-FM in Seattle, KNOW-FM in the Twin Cities, and WXPN-FM in Philadelphia. Pop Vultures was distributed through PRX, the Public Radio Exchange, winning its 2004 Zeitfunk Award for Most Licensed Series.
After the pilot season was completed, the show was cancelled due to limited station carriage. Its cancellation was viewed by many as a sign that public radio program directors were not ready for Pop Vultures' irreverent approach to public radio. Others critiqued its producers for pulling the plug too soon on a fledgling show. KUOW Program Director Jeff Hansen said the PRX episodes were presented to the public radio system as pilots, and questioned Prairie Home Productions' marketing strategy. "It makes it look like Prairie Home Productions doesn't know what they're doing. They're basing pulling the plug on assumptions," he said. 3
Kate Sullivan served as music editor/columnist at LA Weekly newspaper for three years after the conclusion of Pop Vultures.

[[SNePS]]
CATEGORIES: Knowledge representation software, Cognitive architecture, Artificial intelligence, Common Lisp software

SNePS is a knowledge representation, reasoning, and acting (KRRA) system developed and maintained by Stuart C. Shapiro and colleagues at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 
SNePS is simultaneously a logic-based, frame-based, and network-based KRRA system.  It uses an assertional model of knowledge, in that a SNePS knowledge base (KB) consists of a set of assertions (propositions) about various entities.  Its intended model is of an intensional domain of mental entities---the entities conceived of by some agent, and the propositions believed by it.  The intensionality is primarily accomplished by the absence of a built-in equality operator, since any two syntactically different terms might have slightly different Fregean senses.
SNePS has three styles of inference: formula-based, derived from its logic-based personality; slot-based, derived from its frame-based personality; and path-based, derived from its network-based personality.  However, all three are integrated, operating together.
SNePS may be used as a stand-alone KRR system.  It has also been used, along with its integrated acting component, to implement the mind of intelligent agents (cognitive robots), in accord with the GLAIR agent architecture (a layered cognitive architecture).

[[Eucharistic credo]]

CATEGORIES: Catholic spirituality

The Eucharistic ''Credo (credo, Latin for I believe'') is a profession of faith in the Real Presence of Jesus in the sacramental Eucharistic elements written by Pope Gregory VII.
Until the eleventh century, there is no record a Christian theologian challenging the belief in the Real Presence, that is the physical, personal reality, of Jesus in the Eucharistic elements (the bread and wine believed to become the body and blood of Jesus).
The first known challenge comes from Berengarius of Tours. Drawing upon the writings of Ratramnus of the ninth century who considered Jesus spiritually present in the Eucharist, Berengarius denied that the historical Jesus, born of the Virgin Mary was present in the Eucharistic elements. His teaching on the subject became known throughout Europe by around 1047. His position was condemned subsequently by several regional councils including Rome (1050), Verecelli (1050) where for reasons unclear he was imprisoned briefly by the King, Tours (1055), Rome (1059), Poitiers (1075), and St. Maixeut (1076).
While Berengarius had signed several vague retractions, it was when summoned to Rome by Pope Gregory VII in 1078 that he was given the historically famous credo to affirm publicly.  This credo has been considered by theologians through the centuries as the first succinct doctrinal definition by the Church on the Eucharist.  It is credited with crystallizing the ancient teachings of the Church on the Eucharist and ushering in the "Eucharistic Renaissance" of the High Middle Ages typified by a flourishing of various Eucharistic devotions.

Mysterium Fidei is an encyclical letter of Pope Paul VI on the Eucharist, published in September 1965.
Mysterium Fidei was issued just as the closing session of the Second Vatican Council was beginning.  Written in a stern and troubled tone, its purpose was to counter certain theological movements which he perceived were gaining ground in the Roman Catholic Church. Using terminology such as "pastoral concern" and "anxiety," the letter sends a direct and unequivocal message to the Church regarding the Eucharist.  The Pope clearly feared that these novel teachings were threatening the Eucharistic piety which had marked the Catholic Church since the earliest centuries. To emphasize the centrality of the Eucharist in the Church, the Pope echoed the words of St. Ignatius of Antioch, referring to the Blessed Sacrament the "medicine of immortality."
The letter, however, received little attention as the world's interest was focused at the time was on the final works of the council fathers, particularly Lumen Gentium, issued in November of the same year at the conclusion of the Council.

In some classification systems, and  in local terminology, the Tagish Highland is considered to be part of the Boundary Ranges, as is the neighbouring Tahltan Highland to its south.  As classified by the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia per S. Holland, the Tagish Highland is part of the system unofficially described as the Interior Mountains (also the Northern Interior Mountains).
It is not as high or glacial as the neighbouring areas of the Boundary Ranges, but it is very rugged with extreme variations in relief.  Historically it is notable as the location of the network of valleys leading inland from the Chilkoot and White Passes from the Yukon Ports of Skagway and Haines, Alaska to the headwaters of the Yukon River, downstream from which prospectors voyaged to the legendary goldfields of the Klondike Gold Rush.

Lemonade stands are usually in technical violation of several laws, including operation without a business license, lack of adherence to health codes, and sometimes child labor laws.Police in Ga. shut down girls' lemonade stand.

[[Bone cement]]

CATEGORIES: Orthopedic surgical procedures, Biomaterials

Bone cements have been used very successfully to anchor artificial joints (hip joints, knee joints, shoulder and elbow joints) for more than half a century. Artificial joints (referred to as prostheses) are anchored with bone cement. The bone cement fills the free space between the prosthesis and the bone and plays the important role of an elastic zone. This is necessary because the human hip is acted on by approximately 10-12 times the body weight and therefore the bone cement must absorb the forces acting on the hips to ensure that the artificial implant remains in place over the long term.
Bone cement chemically is nothing more than Plexiglas (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate or PMMA). PMMA was used clinically for the first time in the 1940s in plastic surgery to close gaps in the skull. Comprehensive clinical tests of the compatibility of bone cements with the body were conducted before their use in surgery. The excellent tissue compatibility of PMMA allowed bone cements to be used for anchorage of head prostheses in the 1950s.
Today several million procedures of this type are conducted every year all over the world and more than half of them routinely use bone cements - and the proportion is increasing. Bone cement is considered a reliable anchorage material with its ease of use in clinical practice and particularly because of its proven long survival rate with cemented-in prostheses.

[[John Pollard (Royal Navy officer)]]
CATEGORIES: 1787 births, Royal Navy officers, 1868 deaths

John Pollard (1787-1868) was an English born Royal Navy officer who served with Admiral Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar. Pollard is credited with being the man who killed the Frenchman who shot Nelson.
In 1805, at the age of 18, Pollard was serving as a midshipman on the HMS Victory, when it became entangled with the French ship Redoutable. Snipers from the Redoutable opened fire and wounded Nelson, who later died. During the battle, Pollard was stationed on the poop deck, where he was acting as a signaller, along with a quarter-master possibly called John King.
At some point during the fight Pollard was joined by fellow midshipman Francis Edward Collingwood who had come up from the Quarter-deck. Both men returned fire on the French ship and were supplied by the third man. At this point the story differs as to the exact turn of events.
According to author Robert Southey both Pollard and Collingwood fired at the same time killing a Frenchman, who had been identified by the quarter-master as having shot Nelson. The man fell into the mizzen-top and when they recovered him, he was found to have been shot in the head and chest.Southey, Robert, 1813. The Life of Horatio Lord Nelson ISBN 0-87021-301-6, available as a Project Gutenberg eText (number 947)
Pollard, in an 1863 letter to The Times, stated that Collingwood had left the poop deck prior to the death of the French sniper. Ships surgeon Sir William Beatty, writing in a December 1805 edition of the Gibraltar Chronicle, stated that there were two men in the mizzen-top, one of whom was killed by a musket-ball and the other by Pollard.
Pollard was later brought before Sir Thomas Hardy and congratulated as having been the man to avenge Nelson's death. Pollard was promoted to lieutenant in 1806 and continued to serve in the Royal Navy. He did not advance in rank beyond that and was later to join the Irish Coastguard.
In 1852, at the age of 65, he obtained an officers position at the Greenwich Hospital, where he stayed until his death at the age of 81 in 1868. He was buried with the rank of Commander but the grave was later moved and the exact site can't be pinpointed.
Pollard was married in 1822 and had six children.

This claim is to this day believed and frequently repeated, although in October 1830 J.A.

[[Hordley]]

CATEGORIES: Civil parishes in Shropshire, Villages in Shropshire

Hordley is a small and rural village and civil parish in North Shropshire, Shropshire, England.
It lies a few miles south of Ellesmere.
Hordley takes its name from the Hoord Family of whom Henry de Hoord (c.1170) is the first recorded. 
"'In 1215, King John confirms to the Prior and Monks 
of Durham a gift which Henry de Hoord made to them.'[ref]
</ref>
It is thought that the name itself is of Scandinavian origin, there being a family name of Hord in Sweden. Furthermore the Arms of the Hoord family includes a raven, commonly associated with the Norse invaders of the time.
The original medieval manor is thought to have occupied the site where today stands Hordley Manor, a much later building. Some stonework in the cellar of the current building is thought to date from the original building.
Sir Roger Kynaston (c.1433 - 1495), founded the Kynaston of Hordley line. The Kynastons were lords of the manor for a time, and later Kynaston graves can be seen in Hordley Church.
Within the parish boundaries is another small village - Bagley.
Hordley is set down to mainly arable crops, with some dairy farming. Towards the Lower Hordley end of the village is the factory of ABP which prepares and packages beef. Towards the west, there are attractive views of many hills. The River Perry runs through it, joining the River Severn into Shrewsbury. It is generally a quiet, rural area.
Within reach of this village are many easily accessible towns, including Ellesmere, Oswestry and Shrewsbury.
On one day there is a post office set up in the village hall.
It is usually taken that the village is split into two parts, Top and Lower Hordley. This is probably because of the long distance of road separating the two halves with nothing but field either side. Within the upper part there is St. Marys Church which is still in regular use, surrounding this is a small area of grave yards. There is also a farm and some small clusters of housing. Within Lower Hordley is a larger quantity of housing and farms, and the village hall.
The Weston Lullingfields branch of the Ellesmere Canal passed through Lower Hordley until its closure.

Sir William Hillary, 1st Baronet (4 January 1771 – 5 January 1847) was an English soldier, author and philanthropist, best known as the founder of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1824. He was a Yorkshire Quaker by descent, the son of Richard Hillary and his wife, Hannah Wynne.For an account of his family background, see Journal of the Friends Historical Society vol. 60, No.3 pp157-179 "Quakers of Countersett and their legacy" by Christopher Booth
Hillary spent two years as an Equerry to Prince Augustus Frederick,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article by Thomas Seccombe, ‘Hillary, Sir William, first baronet (1770–1847)’, rev. Sinéad Agnew, 2004; online edn, May 2005 http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13319 accessed 8 June 2007 the young son of George III. His duties included sailing with the prince in the Mediterranean, where William Hillary learned his basic seamanship and navigation skills.
Hillary married Essex-born heiress Frances Elizabeth Disney Ffytche (or Fytche) on 21 February 1800. In the same year, their twins were born, a son, Augustus William Hillary (d. 30 December 1855)ThePeerage.com website and a daughter, Elizabeth Mary.
Hillary's religious background did not meet with the approval of his wife's father, but Hillary still spent his wife’s inheritance (some £20,000) on creating England’s largest private army, put at the service of King George III against Napoleon’s threatened invasion. It was for this that he reputedly received his Baronetcy in 1805.
By some accounts, Hillary settled in the Isle of Man in 1808 in order to put a few miles and a little water between himself and his creditors, and to bury quietly the murkier details surrounding his elopement and marriage. In 1813, he re-married (after presumably divorcing his first wife, as she did not die until 1828,Frances Elizabeth Hillary grave monument details) this time to a local Manx woman, Emma Tobin.
Living at Fort Anne, Douglas, Isle of Man, Hillary soon became aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast. He drew up plans for a lifeboat service manned by trained crews, intended not only for the Isle of Man, but for all of the British coast. In February 1823 he published a pamphlet entitled An Appeal To The British Navy On The Humanity And Policy Of Forming A National Institution For The Preservation Of Lives And Property From Shipwreck.
Initially he received little response from the Admiralty but on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, including Thomas Wilson (MP for Southwark) and George Hibbert, chairman of the West Indies Merchants, the plans were enthusiastically adopted and the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded on 4 March 1824 at a meeting in The Tavern, Bishopsgate Street, London.
The title changed 30 years later to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of Hillary's work.
At the age of 60, Hillary took part in the rescue, in 1830, of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas harbour. He commanded the lifeboat, was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. This incident prompted Hillary to set up a scheme to build the Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock. The structure, designed by architect John Welch was completed in 1832 and still stands at the entrance to Douglas harbour (it is the subject of a poem by William Wordsworth).Complete Poetry of William Wordsworth; full-text poems of William Wordsworth, at everypoet.com

[[Kelvin equation]]
CATEGORIES: Surface chemistry, Physical chemistry

The Kelvin equation may be written in the form
Equilibrium vapor pressure depends on droplet size.
The further a vapour is supercooled, the smaller the critical radius becomes. Ultimately it gets as small as a few molecules and the liquid undergoes homogeneous nucleation and growth.
The change in vapor pressure can be attributed to changes in the Laplace pressure. When the Laplace pressure rises in a droplet, the droplet tends to evaporate more easily. 
When applying the Kelvin equation, two cases must be distinguished: A drop of liquid in its own vapor will result in a positively curved liquid surface or a bubble of vapor in a liquid, will result in a negatively curved liquid surface. 
The form of the Kelvin equation here is not the form in which it appeared in Lord Kelvin's article of 1871.  The derivation of the form that appears in this article from Kelvin's original equation was presented by Robert von Helmholtz (son of German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz) in his dissertation of 1885.Robert von Helmholtz (1886) "Untersuchungen über Dämpfe und Nebel, besonders über solche von Lösungen" (Investigations of vapors and mists, especially of such things from solutions), Annalen der Physik, 263 (4) :  508-543.  On pages 523-525, Robert von Helmholtz converts Kelvin's equation to the form that appears here (which is actually the Ostwald-Freundlich equation).

Since the rucksack was the first part of the program issued to Marines, the ruck is commonly referred to as simply "ILBE". The ILBE ruck was designed to replace the existing ALICE and MOLLE packs. The ILBE is designed by Arc'teryx's Law Enforcement and Armed Forces "LEAF" program and manufactured by [tpl]Not a typo|Propper[/tpl] Inc. The backpack is made from Cordura 725 denier fabric, with MARPAT camouflage pattern printed onto it. The pack is also covered with a PALS grid, for the attachment of smaller modular pouches. It includes a main pack, a detachable assault pack and a 100-ounce (3 liter) water reservoir. The ILBE can hold up to 120 pounds and has room for 60mm and 81mm mortar rounds outside the main pack.

[[Chepino Valley]]

CATEGORIES: Valleys of Bulgaria, Geography of Pazardzhik Province, Rhodope Mountains

The Chepino Valley ([tpl]Lang-bg|Чепинска котловина[/tpl], Chepinska kotlovina) or Chepino (Чепино) is the largest valley in the Rhodope Mountains in southern Bulgaria. It is situated along the course of the Chepino River near the Batak Mountain in the northwestern part of the Rhodopes. Located at around 750 m above sea level, it is between 4 and 7 km wide and 18 km long. The bottom of the Chepino Valley is comparatively flat, although hills can also be met. The valley's fault structure is the reason for the frequent earthquakes in the area, as well as for the high number of mineral springs, numbering more than 80 and making the Chepino Valley an important tourist destination in the Rhodopes.
Due to its geographic location, the valley has a considerably milder climate than that in other parts of Bulgaria. The slopes that surround the valley are covered with venerable coniferous forests, mainly of spruce. The second highest peak of the Rhodopes, Golyama Syutkya, is located nearby, and an important city in the valley is Velingrad.
The valley takes its name from the medieval Bulgarian fortress of Tsepina, the capital of Despot Slav's domain in the 13th century, which was excavated near the village of Dorkovo.
In the early 17th century, the Eastern Orthodox Bulgarian inhabitants of the valley were Islamized by the Ottoman authorities of the time, and thus today the population is mixed, with both Orthodox Bulgarians and Pomaks (Muslim Bulgarians) inhabiting the valley.

The result was not a track which Bananarama liked, so they asked their producer Gary Miller to remix it http://www.bananaramauk.com/html/discography/singles/ifoundlove/iflmain.html.  Miller's mix was issued as the A-side of the "I Found Love" single, as the "ROZI Mix".

[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]

CATEGORIES: 1954 books, Andy Warhol, Artists' books, Cats in art

25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy is a privately printed, limited edition artist's book by the American artist Andy Warhol.
It was printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin with Charles Lisanby credited as the author, as he suggested the title, yet there is no text in the book. The calligraphy for the book was done by Julia Warhola, Warhol's mother.
The lithographs were produced on Arches brand watermarked paper using Warhol's blotted line technique. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered copies (although there may have been under 150 produced). Each original was hand colored, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of them were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends.
Warhol's mother left the letter "d" off of the word "Name" in the title and Warhol kept the error in, as he liked the random imperfections which appeared in his creations resulting from the techniques he used. Both Warhol and his mother had a passion for cats and they were all named Sam except for one called Hester. They had so many cats that friends remember them always giving away kittens.
25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy actually only contains 16 cats named Sam followed by one cat in blue titled One Blue Pussy.
Some of the copies were given as Christmas "keepsake" books. These were in the peak of popularity in the 1950s and a number of prominent American families would have a book privately printed to give to their friends. Some families known to follow this practice were the Vanderbilts, Harrimans, Copleys, Altschuls and others.
Three other self-published books by Warhol followed this first title:

CATEGORIES: Bone fractures, Pelvis, Medical emergencies

Pelvic fracture is a disruption of the bony structure of the pelvis, including the hip bone, sacrum and coccyx. The most common cause in elderly is a fall, but the most significant fractures involve high-energy forces such as a motor vehicle accident, cycling accidents, or a fall from significant height. Diagnosis is made on the basis of history, clinical features and special investigations usually including X-ray and CT. Because the pelvis cradles so many internal organs, pelvic fractures may produce significant internal bleeding which is invisible to the eye. Emergency treatment consists of advanced trauma life support management. After stabilisation, the pelvis may be surgically reconstructed.

A naturally occurring retirement community—or a NORC (rhymes with “fork”)—is a community that was not originally designed for seniors, but that has a large proportion of residents who are older adults (at least 60 years old).   These communities are not created to meet the needs of seniors living independently in their homes, but rather evolve naturally, as adult residents age in place.
NORCs may develop in three different ways:
Currently, best estimates place the number of United States communities that could be classified as NORCs in the thousands. AARP estimates that more than a quarter of American seniors currently reside in NORCs.  Experts expect the number of NORCs will increase as the population of seniors continues to grow rapidly.

Founded by former University of Dayton and Central State University coach Jerry Butcher, the Dynamo joined the AISA as one of two expansion franchises (the other being the Jacksonville Generals) playing in the post-season "Challenge Cup" Series. The franchise began regular-season play at Hara Arena starting with the 1988-1989 season and moved to the Ervin J. Nutter Center at Wright State University for the 1990-1991 season.  The Dynamo played its last two seasons in Dayton at the 4,600 seat capacity Dayton Convention Center.
The Dynamo finished last in the league during the team’s first two seasons. In the 1989-1990 season, the Dynamo won the National Division, but the squad lost to the Canton Invaders of Canton, Ohio, in the championship series. The team returned to the championship round the following season, losing to the Chicago Power this time. During the 1991-1992 season, the Dynamo, now in the National Professional Soccer League’s American Division, finished last.

Robert Louis 'Bob' Burns (born November 24, 1950) is an American drummer who was in the original line-up of the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4812/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography: Lynyrd Skynyrd|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|coauthors=Leggett, Steve |publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl]  Burns helped to form the band in 1964 with Gary Rossington and Larry Junstrom and remained until 1974, although by some accounts he left the band for a while during the early 1970s. Burns plays on the band's earliest demos, recorded in 1970, but on the album Skynyrd's First and... Last, a collection of early demos, the drum parts of the songs recorded in 1971 are played by Rickey Medlocke.  That album also contains songs recorded in 1972 which feature Burns on drums, suggesting that Burns may have left the band in 1971 and had returned by 1972.  During a brief period in the early 1970s, Rickey Medlocke occasionally played alongside Burn on drums for live shows, a two-drummer line-up similar to The Allman Brothers Band.
In addition to Skynyrd's First And... Last, Burns also played on the band's first two official albums:  (Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd) and Second Helping.  Burns left in 1974 due to being overwhelmed by life on the road, and was replaced by Artimus Pyle. In 1996, he participated in a performance to promote Freebird: The Movie. On March 13, 2006, he rejoined Lynyrd Skynyrd for one performance as he played alongside Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Ed King, Artimus Pyle and the Honkettes at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.
Burns currently lives in Cartersville, GA.

David "Bronco" Layne (born Sheffield, 29 July 1939) is a former English footballer most famous for playing for Sheffield Wednesday and his involvement in the British betting scandal of 1964.
Layne started his career playing part-time for Rotherham United in the summer of 1957. He only played eleven matches for the Millers over two seasons, but still managed to score four goals before he was given a free transfer and joined Swindon Town. Layne became a prolific goalscorer whilst at Swindon, netting 28 goals in 41 games and attracting the attention of Bradford City who paid a club record £6,000 for his signature midway through the 1960–61 season.
Layne broke the Bantams' goalscoring record in 1961–62 scoring 34 league goals over the course of the season. His goalscoring prowess was now attracting the attention of bigger clubs and he moved to Sheffield Wednesday in the summer of 1962. Bradford recouped £22,500 for Layne, setting the record for highest fee received by the club at the time.
Layne spent two seasons at Hillsborough and was the club's top scorer in both with 58 goals in 81 games over the two-year period. Layne's career was however cut short in its prime when he became involved in the British betting scandal of 1964. Layne was found guilty of match fixing and betting against his own team and along with several other players was jailed and banned from football for life.
The ban was lifted eight years laterhttp://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-british-footballs-longest-bans-1180346.html and Layne rejoined Wednesday in 1972 but failed to earn a place on the team and was sent on loan to Hereford United. After only four games at the club he retired from league football and joined Matlock Town where he spent the rest of his career before being forced to retire through injury.
In 2006, it was reported that he was working as a pub landlord in Sheffield.Broadbent, Rick. "Swan still reduced to tears by the fix that came unstuck: Our correspondent talks to one of the players jailed after the betting scandal that rocked football," The Times (July 22, 2006).
Layne's nickname was inspired by a popular American Western TV series, Bronco which was broadcast in the UK just as Layne was establishing his career. The protagonist, Bronco Layne, was played in the series by Ty Hardin.

[[Cover test]]
CATEGORIES: Ophthalmology

A cover test or cover-uncover test is an objective determination of the presence and amount of ocular deviation. It is typically performed by orthoptists, ophthalmologists and optometrists during eye examinations.
The two primary types of cover tests are:
The test involves having the child (typically) focusing on a near object. A cover is placed over an eye for a short moment then removed while observing  both eyes for movement. The "lazy eye" will deviate inwards or outwards. The process is repeated on both eyes and then with the child focusing on a distant object.
The cover test is used to determine both the type of ocular deviation and measure the amount of deviation. The two primary types of ocular deviations are the tropia and the phoria. A tropia is a misalignment of the two eyes when a patient is looking with both eyes uncovered. A phoria (or latent deviation) only appears when binocular viewing is broken and the two eyes are no longer looking at the same object.
The unilateral cover test is performed by having the patient focus on an object then covering the fixating eye and observing the movement of the other eye.  If the eye was exotropic, covering the fixating eye will cause an inwards movement; and esotropic if covering the fixating eye will cause an outwards movement.  The alternating cover test, or cross cover test is used to detect total deviation (tropia + phoria).

The Azerbaijani are of mixed ethnic origin, the oldest element deriving from the indigenous population of eastern Transcaucasia and possibly from the Medians of northern Persia. This population was Persianized during the period of the Sassanian dynasty of Iran (3rd–7th century CE). Turkification of the population can be dated from the region’s conquest by the Seljuq Turks in the 11th century and the continued influx of Turkic populations in subsequent centuries, including those groups that migrated during the Mongol conquests in the 13th century. (The greater portion of the tribes that formed the Mongol forces or were stimulated by the Mongol conquest to migrate were Turkic.)"Azerbaijani" - Encyclopædia Britannica

Portage Path is part of the C5 ("Children Connecting Classroom, Community, and Curriculum") programme.  In the 1980s it was one of the first schools in the area to receive classroom computers from Apple Computer.  The goal of the C5 programme is to extend pupils time with computers by enouraging pupils' families to be connected both to Internet and to the school.  The C5 programme provides USD500 for families towards the cost of one of several types of personal computer, and Time Warner Cable provides free Road Runner Internet access. As of 2001, half of all pupils were connected to Internet at home via the C5 programme.  Pupils use their home computers for homework, and a web site to set up portfolios and to communicate with their teachers from home and with their families from school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mistersugar.com/index.php?id=686|title=Families That Learn Together|author=Anton Zuiker|work=Northern Ohio Live Magazine|date=October 2001[/tpl]  School lessons also heavily employ computers, with, for example, pupils being instructed in mathematics, geography, and problem solving by daily consultation of weather reports on Intellicast, and learning about Groundhog Day by looking at on-line maps of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and visiting the web sites of its shops.[tpl]cite journal|title=Teaching Technology To Kids|journal=Smart Computing|date=September 1997|volume=3|issue=9|author=Michelle Wirth|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/cforkids/kid0597/lkid0597.asp[/tpl]
Another programme provided by the school is ROAD ("Reach Out and Dance"), which is intended to help pupils with stress of school and family life, and with anger management problems.  It is run by the Cuyahoga Valley Youth Ballet, which teaches dance classes to pupils on Friday afternoons, structuring the classes very much like ballet classes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.apria.com/common/aw_cmp_printNews/1,2762,304796,00.html|work=Akron Beacon Journal|year=2004|author=Elaine Guregian|title=Dance therapy[/tpl]
The original school building was built in 1908. http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-35494841_ITM    Plans to demolish and rebuild the school, as part of the USD800million Akron City School District construction project, were met with mixed emotions. Some neighborhood residents wanted to see the school either be renovated rather than demolished, or moved to another site; while parents of students wanted a new school as soon as possible. Portage Path students will be moving to a temporary facility in January 2009 while their school is demolished and rebuilt- keeping as many historical artificts as possible.
The new building, known as the Portage Path Community Learning Center, was dedicated on August 30, 2010.  http://www.imagineakronschools.com/content/segment2schools/portagepath.htm

[[Lebanese pound]]
CATEGORIES: Economy of Lebanon, Fixed exchange rate, 1924 introductions

The Lebanese pound (Arabic: lira; French: livre; ISO 4217: LBP) is the currency unit of Lebanon. It is divided into 100 piastres but inflation has eliminated the subdivisions.
The plural form of lira, as used on the currency, is either lirat (ليرات) or the same, whilst there are four forms for qirsh: the dual qirshan (قرشان), the plural qirush (قروش) used with numbers 3-10, the accusative singular qirsha (قرشا) used with 11-99, or the genitive singular qirshi (قرش) used with multiples of 100. In both cases, the number determines which plural form is used. Note that before the Second World War, the Arabic spelling of the subdivision was غرش (girsh). All of Lebanon's coins and banknotes are bilingual in Arabic and French.

CATEGORIES: Radio masts and towers in Europe, Transmitter sites in England, Broadcasting

The Membury transmitting station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility, situated adjacent to the M4 motorway at the Membury services in the south-west corner of the parish of Lambourn close to the town of Hungerford, in Berkshire. It is owned and operated by Arqiva.
It has a 152.4 m (500 ft) high guyed steel lattice mast. It was constructed by the ITA in 1965 to bring ITV signals (provided by ATV) to the "South Midlands", including Oxford, Swindon, Newbury and Marlborough on 405-line VHF, using Channel 12 (Band III).
It was not used for any broadcast services for over a decade after the closure of 405 line television in 1983. However in the late 90s a low power VHF FM filler for the four national BBC radio networks was added (at 125watts), improving reception along the M4 corridor between Newbury and Swindon.
In January 2003, a DAB transmitter was added for the NOW Swindon & Wiltshire multiplex. The BBC added a signal for its national DAB services in 2009.
The mast also hosts transmission equipment for numerous mobile telephone networks.
The mast is a highly visible landmark and can be clearly seen from The Ridgeway, White Horse Hill and most of the Lambourn Downs, making it a useful reference point for hikers and ramblers. The red safety lights which mark the structure at night become visible for eastbound M4 motorists from as early as Swindon East (Junction 15).

[tpl]nihongo|Kaneko Ietada|金子 家忠|extra=1138 - March 6, 1216[/tpl] was a famed samurai following the Heian period of the 12th century of Japan. 
Ietada served under Minamoto no Yoshitomo during the Hōgen Rebellion of 1156. Throughout this rebellion, Ietada personally fought against two brothers known as the Takama brothers (Takama Saburo, and Takama Shiro). Even though the Takama brothers were widely known for their strength in combat, Ietada got on top of Shiro, holding on to him, about to take his head. Saburo who in turn, dropped on top of Ietada, trying to keep his brother from being killed, pulled at the helmet of Ietada to face him up, intending on taking his head. Ietada followed in holding down the left and right arms of the enemy currently beneath him with his knees, yanked up the left armor skirt of Saburo (who was on top), and turning upon him, stabbed him more than three times as if both hilt and fist should sink into him.
After he flinched back, Ietada cut off the head of Shiro and raising it stuck on his sword point shouted: "In the presence of Minamoto Tametomo of Tsukushi, famed these days as a superhuman, Ietada has killed Takama Shiro and his brother". Following this, Ietada remounted his horse ready to fight another battle, proclaiming: "I, Kaneko no Juro Ietada, a resident of Musashi province, have come forth before the renowned Minamoto Tametomo of Tsukushi, and with my own hands have taken both the heads of the two mounted warriors. Observe this, both enemy and allies! A feat rarely achieved either in ancient times or the present!...I am the Ietada who wishes to bequeth his name to generations to come. If there are warriors among Tametomo's band who feel they are my match, let them come and grapple with me.".
Ietada is singled out as an example of the honor of samurai and prowess by the author of Hogen Monogatari:

Since 1976 the Susan B.

The idea for the prize came out of the personal grief of the friends and family of a fine young editor who was killed in an automobile accident just as her career was beginning to achieve its promise of excellence. She was 30 years old, and those who knew her believed she would do much to further the causes of literature and women. Her family, her friends, and her professional associates in the publishing industry created the endowment from which the prize is bestowed, in memory of Janet Heidinger Kafka and the literary standards and personal ideals for which she stood.http://www.rochester.edu/college/wst/kafka_prize/index.html "Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize", SBAI Website University of Rochester, January 13, 2012

Bede is the name of a Tyne and Wear Metro station in Jarrow.  It is named after the Venerable Bede, a monk who established St Paul's monastery nearby during the 7th century.  It serves an area mostly consisting of industrial estates, and is immediately adjacent to the J. Barbour & Sons clothing factory.
Bede station was new when the Metro line to South Shields opened, although the route had opened in 1872. It was the start of the double track section towards South Shields, as the parallel BR single-track freight line only ran as far as the nearby Simonside wagon works (it closed in the late 1980s), but now the double track starts further west, where the branch to Jarrow oil terminal diverges. Originally on the Green line, it is now on the Yellow line.
Some ¾ mile (1¼ km) west of the station is St Bedes Junction, the site of a 1915 rail crash in which 18 people were killed when a South Shields to Newcastle passenger train crashed into a banking engine.

The river enters the Sea of Cortez (or Gulf of California.)   The name of the river has been shortened to Río Santa Rosalía, and likewise the name of the town has been reduced to simply "Mulegé."  Another city grew about 30 miles north of Mulegé because of a large copper mining operation.  This city borrowed the name Santa Rosalía and it is likely for this reason that "Santa Rosalía de" was dropped from the name Mulegé.

[[Pygmy slow loris]]

CATEGORIES: Wildlife of Yunnan, Mammals of Cambodia, Mammals of China, Mammals of Laos, Mammals of Vietnam

The pygmy slow loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus) is a species of slow loris found east of the Mekong River in Vietnam, Laos, eastern Cambodia, and China. It occurs in a variety of forest habitats, including tropical dry forests, semi-evergreen, and evergreen forests. The animal is nocturnal and arboreal, crawling along branches using slow movements in search of prey. Unlike other primates, it does not leap. It lives together in small groups usually with one or two offspring. An adult can grow to around [tpl]convert|19|to|23|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long and has a very short tail. It weighs about [tpl]Convert|450|g|lb|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Its diet consists of fruits, insects, small fauna, tree sap, and floral nectar. The animal has a toxic bite, which it gets by licking a toxic secretion from glands on the inside of its elbows. The teeth in its lower jaw form a comb-like structure called a toothcomb that is used for scraping resin from tree bark.
The pygmy slow loris mates once every 12–18 months and has one or two offspring after an average gestation period of six months. For the first few days, the young loris clings to the belly of its mother. After six months the baby will be weaned, the females reach sexual maturity by 16 months, while the male reaches maturity by about 18 months. The pygmy slow loris is seasonally fertile during the months of July and August. Chemical signals play a role in the reproductive behavior of female pygmy slow lorises. Urine scent markings have a strong characteristic odor and are used to communication information about social relationships.
The habitat of the pygmy slow loris in Vietnam was greatly reduced due to extensive burning, clearing, and defoliating of forests during the Vietnam War. Extensive hunting for traditional medicines is currently putting severe pressure on Cambodian populations. The pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting, trade, and habitat destruction; consequently, it is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and in 2006 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified it as "Vulnerable".

CATEGORIES: Aerodynamics

P-factor, also known as asymmetric blade effect and asymmetric disc effect, is an aerodynamic phenomenon experienced by a moving propeller,(Willits 3-49) that is responsible for asymmetrical relocation of the propeller's center of thrust when aircraft is at a high angle of attack. This shift in the location of the center of thrust will exert a yawing moment on the aircraft, causing it to yaw slightly to one side. A rudder input is required to counteract the yawing tendency.

On 10 July 1963, Sharjah opened its own post office and began to issue its stamps and postal stationery under the name of Sharjah & Dependencies (which included Kalba, Khor Fakkan, and Dibbah). There were also unauthorized overprints using Himriyyah, a name of a village in the sheikhdom. Sharjah and its dependencies joined the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, but it continued to issue its own stamps. On 31 July 1972, the UAE assumed full postal responsibilities. Nevertheless, Sharjah continued to use its own stamps until the issuance of the first UAE definitive series on 1 January 1973. Covers with mixed UAE and Sharjah frankings are known.

The Borough is a collection of poems by George Crabbe published in 1810.  Written in heroic couplets, the poems are arranged as a series of 24 letters, covering various aspects of borough life and detailing the stories of certain inhabitants’ lives. 
Of the letters, the best known is that of Peter Grimes in Letter XXII, which formed the basis for Benjamin Britten’s opera by the same name. Letter XXI describes Abel Keene, a village schoolmaster and then a merchant's clerk who was led astray, lost his place and finally hanged himself.[tpl]cite book | last = Brewer | first = E.

The poem was begun in 1804, three years before the publication of The Parish Register, and demonstrates a clear development in Crabbe’s writing between the pastoral concerns shown in The Village, and the concentration on the life stories of individuals as seen in the Tales.

The Nativity of Christ Cathedral ([tpl]lang-lv|Kristus Piedzimšanas pareizticīgo katedrāle[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ru|Христорождественский кафедральный собор[/tpl]), Riga, Latvia was built to a design by Nikolai Chagin in a Neo-Byzantine style between 1876 and 1883, during the period when the country was part of the Russian Empire. It is the largest Orthodox cathedral in the Baltic provinces built with the blessing of the Russian Tsar Alexander II  on the initiative of local governor-general Pyotr Bagration  and bishop Veniamin Karelin. The Nativity of Christ Cathedral is renowned for its icons, some of which were painted by Vasili Vereshchagin. During the First World War German troops occupied Riga and turned its largest Russian Orthodox cathedral into a Lutheran church. In independent Latvia  the Nativity of Christ Cathedral once again became an Orthodox cathedral in 1921. Archbishop Jānis Pommers, a native Latvian, played a key part in the defence of the cathedral, including defence from government which was extremely unfriendly to Orthodox Church in the first years of independent Latvia.  In the early 1960s Soviet authorities closed down the cathedral and converted its building into a  planetarium. The cathedral has been restored since Latvia regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

The Starry Plough banner ([tpl]lang-ga|An Camchéachta[/tpl]) was originally used by the Irish Citizen Army, a socialist, Republican movement. James Connolly, co-founder of the Irish Citizen Army with Jack White, said the significance of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars.
The original Starry plough was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the Irish Citizen Army during the 1916 Easter Rising. The flag depicts the constellation of Ursa Major, known as The Plough in Ireland and Britain, or in the US, the Big Dipper, one of the most prominent features of the night sky over Ireland throughout the year.
While similar to the state flag of Alaska, it predates Alaska's by more than a decade.

CATEGORIES: Rolling robots, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993 robots, Robots of the United States

Polly was a robot created at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Ian Horswill for his PhD and published in 1993 as a technical report.
Polly was the first mobile robot to move at animal-like speeds (1m per second) using computer vision for its navigation. It was an example of behavior based robotics. Horswill's PhD supervisors were Rodney Brooks and Lynn Andrea Stein. For a few years Polly gave tours of the AI laboratory's seventh floor, using canned speech to point out landmarks such as Anita Flynn's office. When someone approached Polly, it would introduce itself and offer a tour, asking them to answer by waving their foot.Horswill, Ian. "Polly: A vision-based artificial agent." Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). 1993.
The "Polly algorithm" is a way to navigate in a cluttered space using very low resolution vision to find uncluttered areas to move forward into, assuming that the pixels at the bottom of the frame (the closest to the robot) show an example of an uncluttered area. Since this could be done 60 times a second, the algorithm only needed to discriminate three categories: telling the robot at each instant to go straight, towards the right or towards the left.
Polly was built from minimalist machinery and runs on a hardware platform that could be duplicated for less than $10,000.   The machine was intended to show that very simple visual machinery can be used to solve real tasks in unmodified environments.

[[The Cloister and the Hearth]]
CATEGORIES: 1860 novels, Historical novels, Victorian novels, Novels by Charles Reade

The Cloister and the Hearth (1861) is an historical novel by the English author Charles Reade. Set in the 15th century, it relates the story revolving about the travels of a young scribe and illuminator, Gerard Eliassoen, through several European countries. The Cloister and the Hearth often  describes the events, people and their practices in minute detail. Its main theme is the struggle between man's obligations to family and to Church.
Married to Margaret Brandt, Gerard sets off to Rome from Holland in order to escape the persecution of a vicious burgomaster as well as to earn money for the support of his family. Margaret awaits his return in Holland and in the meantime gives birth to his second son. As Gerard is the favourite with his parents, his two lazy and jealous brothers decide to divert him from Holland and receive a larger share of fortune after their parents' death. They compose and dispatch a letter to Gerard informing him falsely that Margaret has died. Gerard believes the news and, stricken by grief, gives himself to a dissolute life and even attempts a suicide.  After being saved from death by chance, he takes vows and becomes a Dominican friar. Later Gerard preaches throughout Europe and, while in Holland, discovers that Margaret is alive.  He is afraid of temptation and in order to shun Margaret becomes a hermit.  Margaret discovers Gerard's hiding place and convinces him to come back to normal life in which he becomes a vicar of a small town. Gerard and Margaret no longer live as a man and wife, but nevertheless see each other several times a week.  A few years pass, Gerard's sons grow up and are sent to a private school.  Later, having heard that plague breaks out at the school, Margaret rushes to rescue her sons, but contracts the disease herself and dies shortly afterwards.  Gerard takes her demise painfully, renounces his vicarship and dies in a few weeks.
The author of The Cloister and the Hearth, at the end of this story, reveals that Margaret's and Gerard's son, also named Gerard, became the great Catholic scholar and Humanist, Erasmus of Rotterdam, a major historical figure.  Indeed, little is actually known about Erasmus' actual parentage (apparently illegitimate), though his parents were in reality named Margaret and Roger Gerard.  Reade was apparently using his imagination to fill in some historical gaps in Erasmus' background.[tpl]Editorializing|date=July 2011[/tpl]  The Cloister and the Hearth can easily be read as an attack on various requirements of Catholic priesthood that prevented Margaret's and Gerard's love from continuing to be consummated;  and this attack is very consistent with some of Erasmus' thought.

CATEGORIES: Particle physics facilities, E-Science, Large Hadron Collider

The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC; formerly SLHC, Super Large Hadron Collider) is a proposed upgrade to the Large Hadron Collider to be made after around ten years of operation.  The upgrade aims at increasing the luminosity of the machine by a factor of 10, up to 1035 cm−2s−1, providing a better chance to see rare processes and improving statistically marginal measurements. 
Many different paths exist for upgrading the collider. A collection of different designs of the high luminosity interaction regions is being maintained by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).IR optics collection
A workshop was held in 2006 to establish which are the most promising options.LUMI 06 workshop
Increasing LHC luminosity involves reduction of beam size at the collision point and either reduction of bunch length and spacing, or significant increase in bunch length and population. The maximum integrated luminosity increase of the existing options is about a factor of 4 higher than the LHC ultimate performance, unfortunately far below the LHC upgrade project's initial ambition of a factor of 10. However, at the latest LUMI'06 workshop, several suggestions were proposed that would boost the LHC peak luminosity by a factor of 10 beyond nominal towards 1035 cm−2s−1.
The resultant higher event rate poses important challenges for the particle detectors located in the collision areas.ATLAS upgrade web page

[[Immunodiagnostics]]

CATEGORIES: Branches of immunology, Immunologic tests, Clinical pathology, Pathology

Immunodiagnostics is a diagnostic methodology that uses an antigen-antibody reaction as their primary means of detection. The concept of using immunology as a diagnostic tool was introduced in 1960 as a test for serum insulin. A second test was developed in 1970 as a test for thyroxine in the 1970s. 
It is well-suited for the detection of even the smallest of amounts of (bio)chemical substances. Antibodies specific for a desired antigen can be conjugated with a radiolabel, fluorescent label, or color-forming enzyme and are used as a "probe" to detect it. Well known applications include pregnancy tests, immunoblotting, ELISA and immunohistochemical staining of microscope slides. The speed, accuracy and simplicity of such tests has led to the development of rapid techniques for the diagnosis of disease, microbes and even illegal drugs in vivo (of course tests conducted in a closed environment have a higher degree of accuracy). Such testing is also used to distinguish compatible blood types.
The Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay or ELISA and the Lateral-Flow test, also known as the dipstick or rapid test, currently are the two predominant formats in immunodiagnostics.

Glory ([tpl]lang-ru|Подвиг[/tpl]) is a Russian novel written by Vladimir Nabokov between 1930 and 1932 and first published in Paris. 
The novel has been seen by some critics as a kind of fictional dress-run-through of the author's famous memoir Speak, Memory.[tpl]citeneeded|date=June 2013[/tpl]  Its Swiss-Russian hero, Martin Edelweiss, shares a number of experiences and sensations with his creator: goal-tending at Cambridge University, Cambridge fireplaces, English morning weather, a passion for rail travel. It is, however, the story of an émigré family's escape from Russia, a young man's education in England, and his (perhaps) disastrous return to the nation of his birth—the "feat" of the novel's Russian title.

[[L-kick]]

CATEGORIES: Capoeira

An L-kick is a movement in capoeira, breakdancing and other martial arts and dance forms. It is executed by throwing the body into a cartwheel motion, but rather than completing the wheel, the body flexes while supported by one hand on the ground.  One leg is brought downwards and forwards in a kicking motion while the other remains in the air (giving rise to the name). The kick is sometimes held, like a freeze, then returned to standing.
Variations include a shotgun kick, in which the non-kicking leg is bent dramatically towards the body so that the legs resemble a shotgun shape, an elbow L-kick where the kick is supported by the elbow and forearm placed on the ground rather than just a hand, and a capoeira switch where L-kicks are performed with first one leg then the other, in different directions and without landing the cartwheel motion.
The move was introduced to the b boy world by Chris Gatdula aka Cristyle of the acclaimed dance group Jabbawockeez.

[[Harley-Davidson Shovelhead engine]]

CATEGORIES: Harley-Davidson engines

The Shovelhead is an air-cooled, 45 degree, V-twin motorcycle engine manufactured from 1966 to 1984 by Harley-Davidson.  Initial models had an engine displacement of  [tpl]convert|1208|cc|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. During production of the 1978 model year, this was increased to [tpl]convert|1340|cc|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] for Harley's Big Twin bikes.http://pingelonline.com/harley-davidson_lineage.htm 1978 model shovelheads with the larger engine displacement are sometimes called 1978½ models.
The "shovel" cylinder head represented an offshoot of the panhead design it replaced in 1966http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1960s.jsp?locale=en_US but featured a slightly different look. The name was derived from the appearance of the rocker box covers. Because these covers bring to mind the head of coal shovels when inverted, the name shovelhead was a natural progression. The shovel engines powered Harleys up until the introduction of the Evolution engine in 1984, ending the reign of the "shovel" as enthusiasts frequently call these engines.  The shovel engine does not have covers, per se, but rocker boxes and rocker arms which pivot on shafts. The design provided more than a unique look; it produced 10% more horsepower than the panhead engine which it replaced. From 1966 through 1969 the shovelhead kept the panhead style lower end. These early style shovelheads with the generator bottoms were often referred to as slabside shovels. From 1970 on the shovelheads used an alternator bottom often termed a cone shovel.
A number of third-party engine manufacturers produce custom Shovelhead-style engines, in a variety of bores, many much larger than the original design displacements.  Each manufacturer includes upgrades to the original design to improve the performance and reliability while still providing the original styling and overall engine structure.

[[Federación, Entre Ríos]]
CATEGORIES: Populated places in Entre Ríos Province, Uruguay River

Federación is a city in the northeast of the province of Entre Ríos, Argentina. It has 13,789 inhabitants as per the [tpl]census-ar|2001[/tpl]. It lies on the provincial and international border with Uruguay, by the reservoir of the Salto Grande Dam, on the right-hand (western) banks of the Uruguay River, about 45 km upstream from the city of Concordia and 265 km from the provincial capital Paraná, near National Route 14.
The original town was a ranch and waypost, named Mandisoví, created in 1777, which grew into a prosperous village but fell then to civil strife. A new town of Mandisoví was founded in a close location by Colonel Manuel Antonio Urdinarrain, who commanded the area, under the orders of the caudillo Justo José de Urquiza. Urdinarrain notified Urquiza about the new town and asked him to name it. Urquiza chose the name Pueblo de la Federación (Town  of the Federation).
In 1974 the citizens of Federación underwent another relocation, as the latest settlement near the Uruguay River was to be flooded by the waters of Salto Grande. The city was demolished and reconstructed in two years. The new Federación was formally inaugurated in 1979 by de facto President, military dictator Jorge Rafael Videla.
Today, Federación is part of a major touristic corridor of Entre Ríos, and is nationally known for its hot springs. The city provides plenty of lodging facilities (hotels, bungalows, camping sites). It hosts an annual National Festival of the Lake and traditional Carnivals.
Besides tourism, the local economy is based on citrus crops and the timber industry (the city has 22 sawmills), besides small-scale beekeeping.

John Lee Smith (1894–1963) was the 32nd Lieutenant Governor of Texas during World War II and a vocal opponent of Texas labor unions during his tenure.
Born May 16, 1894 at Chico, Texas, and raised in Throckmorton, Texas, Smith was educated at Stanford University and West Texas State Teachers College before teaching school. In 1918, he went to France as a member of American Expeditionary Forces; while overseas, he also studied at a French university. Upon his return, he studied law at Chautauqua, New York, and went back to Throckmorton to practice law.
In 1920, Smith was elected Throckmorton County Judge and was the youngest judge in Texas at the time. He served until 1926, and then spent five years as a lawyer with the state education department in Austin. Smith returned to the private practice of law in 1931.
Smith was elected to the Texas Senate in 1940, and ran for and won the lieutenant governorship in 1942. He was reelected in 1944. While in the Legislature, both as member and presiding officer of the Senate, Smith was a critic of the closed shop;  he supported legislation that would prohibit a person from interfering with another person's right to engage in a lawful occupation. He also supported a provision that would make it a felony for any union laborer to commit an act of violence while on strike and the Manford Act of 1943, a union regulation bill.
In 1946, Smith sought the Democratic nomination for governor, but he finished fifth behind Beauford Jester, Homer Rainey, Grover Sellers, and Jerry Sadler. Returning to the private practice of law, he formed a partnership with his son in Lubbock, where he died on September 26, 1963.

Go Open Source was a campaign mainly concentrating on South Africa to create awareness of, educate about, and provide access to free/open-source software. The campaign was important in ensuring, once awareness of free and open source software was created, that interested parties had the ability to gain access to the software and services and that they have access to additional resources for support and training. The campaign contributed in planning for a transition to free/open-source software within the South African government. The campaign also launched the Geek Freedom League which is a group promoting free/open-source software to South Africa. As of May 2006 there are nearly 5000 South African members.
The campaign was launched by Mark Shuttleworth on behalf of Canonical, the CSIR's Meraka Institute, HP, and the Shuttleworth Foundation.
The Go Open Source campaign officially launched in May 2004 and completed its two-year run at the end of May 2006.

The Rock Shag (Phalacrocorax magellanicus), also known as the Magellanic Cormorant, is a marine cormorant found around the southernmost coasts of South America.  Its breeding range is from around Valdivia, Chile, south to Cape Horn and Tierra del Fuego, and north to Punta Tombo in Argentina.  In winter it is seen further north, with individuals reaching as far as Santiago, Chile on the west coast and Uruguay on the east.  The birds also breed around the coasts of the Falkland Islands
At a distance, the Rock Shag is a black and white bird, with head, neck and upperparts black and chest and underparts white.  Closer up, the black areas vary from metallic blue to oily green, and are flecked with white in places.  The legs and feet are a pink, fleshy colour, and the bare flesh around the beak and eyes is brick red. In breeding condition, there is a blackish though not very prominent crest on the forehead, and a distinctive white ear patch.  There is even less sexual dimorphism than in most cormorant species, but males are 5%-10% larger on most size measurements.
Like all cormorants, the Rock Shag feeds by diving for underwater prey.  It feeds close to shore, often diving at the edge of kelp beds and apparently finding small fish (predominantly cod icefishes, Patagonothen sp.) sheltering among the weed.  Studies with depth gauges suggest that it is a fairly shallow diver, typically going about 5m below the surface with few individuals ever diving deeper than 10m, although its prey mainly come from the sea floor.  Dive times are typically around 30 seconds.  Its breeding range overlaps markedly with that of the Imperial Shag Leucocarbo atriceps, but the two species' foraging ranges are different since the Imperial Shag tends to dive in deeper water, further out from shore.
The Rock Shag usually nests on ledges on steep, bare, rocky cliffs.  It normally lays 3 eggs, though nests of from 2 to 5 eggs have been seen. Nesting colonies range is size from 5 pairs to nearly 400.
Like a number of other species of cormorant that are commonly called shags, the Rock Shag is placed by some authors in a genus Leucocarbo.  Cladistic analysis suggests that it is related to other cliff-nesting species such as the Red-footed Shag, Pelagic cormorant and Red-faced Shag.

[[PsyS]]
CATEGORIES: School psychology, Academic degrees

The PsyS is a post-masters specialist degree in psychology, and is usually specialized in school psychology. The PsyS degree is a four-year program, the first two years earning an MS (usually in general psychology, developmental psychology, or school psychology) and the last two earning the specialist degree. As a whole, the degree includes three years of course work (including practice) and a one year internship. 
This degree is primarily designed for practicing in the school setting, although after three years of post-grad field work one can operate in private practice. This degree is not designed for those who would like to attain a PhD, however, it is possible to switch over some credits in search of an EdD after the PsyS is completed.  
In addition, this degree is used in clinical psychology. In this application it is a two-year post-masters degree. This degree entails two years of course work including a clinical practicum and is often the first part of a four-year PsyD degree. The PsyD is a degree specializing in clinical psychology training, in lieu of the more research based PhD.

CATEGORIES: 1997 singles, Limp Bizkit songs, Songs written by Fred Durst, Songs written by Wes Borland

"Counterfeit" is a song by the American nu metal band Limp Bizkit from their debut album Three Dollar Bill, Y'all (1997). Notable for showcasing guitarist Wes Borland's experimental playing style, the song is influenced by heavy metal and hip hop. The song was written by Borland, DJ Lethal, Fred Durst, John Otto and Sam Rivers as a response to local bands that copied Limp Bizkit's style.
The song was released as the album's first single in 1997, prior to the album's release. "Counterfeit" was the subject of controversy when Interscope Records paid a Portland radio station to play the song fifty times as a paid advertising, sparking payola accusations and criticism of the band and label. In 1999, the song was reissued as another single under the title "Counterfit Countdown". It also appears on multiple compilations.

[[Afroinsectiphilia]]
CATEGORIES: Mammals of Africa, Phylogenetics

The Afroinsectiphilia (African insectivores) is a clade that has been proposed based on the results of recent molecular studies.Asher, Robert J.; Bennet, Nigel and Lehmann, Thomas. "The new framework for understanding placental mammal evolution," BioEssays 31(8):853 Many of its constituent members  were once regarded as part of the order Insectivora, but Insectivora is now considered to be polyphyletic and is, as a result, possibly obsolete. This proposed classification is based on molecular studies only, and there is no morphological evidence for it.[tpl]cite book|title=The Rise of Placental Mammals: Origins and Relationships of the Major Extant Clades|first1=Kenneth David |last1=Rose|first2= J. David |last2=Archibald|publisher=JHU Press|year= 2005|isbn=0-8018-8022-X|page=65[/tpl]
The golden moles and tenrecs are part of this clade. Some also regard the elephant shrews and aardvarks as part of it, although these two order are traditionally seen as primitive ungulates. The sister group of the Afroinsectiphilia is the Paenungulata, which were also traditionally regarded as ungulates.
If the clade of Afrotheria is genuine, then the Afroinsectiphilia are the closest relatives of the Pseudungulata (here regarded as part of Afroinsectiphilia) and the Paenungulata. In a classification governed by morphological data, both the Pseudungulata and Paenungulata are seen as true ungulates, thus not related to Afroinsectiphilia. However, DNA research is thought to provide a more fundamental classification.

[[Motorola Type II]]

CATEGORIES: Trunked radio systems

Motorola Type II refers to the second generation Motorola trunked radio systems that replaced fleets and subfleets with the concept of talkgroups and individual radio IDs. There are no dependencies on fleetmaps, therefore there are no limitations on how many radio IDs can participate on a talkgroup. This allows for greater flexibility for the agency. When scanning Motorola IDs, each Type II user ID appears as an even 4- or 5-digit number without a dash (example 2160).
With the introduction of Type II, the "System ID" was also introduced.  This is a four digit identifier unique to each trunking system.  The purpose of the System ID is to allow radios to operate only on that specific system, and to identify each system.  The System ID also allows for enhanced security because a radio now requires a System Key, unique to the System ID in order to be programmed onto any given system.  Type I systems do not use unique System IDs, thus the possibility exists for overlapping coverage in busy areas.
The term SmartNet refers to a set of features that make Motorola Type I and II trunked systems APCO-16 compliant. These include better security, emergency signaling, dynamic regrouping, remote radio monitoring, and other features. 
The following is true of a Type II SmartNet system:

The Hart Ranges were named in honour of British Columbia Premier John Hart, as is the highway which traverses the Pine Pass in the northern part of the range, connecting the north-central Interior of the province to its Peace River District to the northeast.
The boundaries of the Hart Ranges are the Rocky Mountain Trench and the McGregor Plateau on the west/southwest, the Peace Reach of Williston Lake on the north, and a certain line of demarcation with the Rocky Mountain Foothills to the east/northeast.

[[Motorola Type I]]

CATEGORIES: Trunked radio systems

Motorola Type I Is the original type of Motorola's Trunked radio system;  it is  based on Fleets and Subfleets. Each system had a certain number of Fleets assigned, and then each Fleet had a certain number of Subfleets and radio IDs. The distribution of Fleets and Subfleets on a Type I system is determined by the system Fleetmap. Motorola Type I systems are not scalable because they limit the amount of IDs any fleet or subfleet can support. Each Type I ID appears as a three or four digit number, followed by a hyphen, followed by a one or two digit number (example 200-14).
The term "Privacy Plus" refers to a Type I system. Privacy Plus systems are normally older public safety systems and SMRs.

[[Motorola Type IIi Hybrid]]

CATEGORIES: Trunked radio systems

A Motorola Type IIi Hybrid system is a type of Trunked radio system that mixes "blocks" of Type I Fleets/Subfleets with Type II talkgroups. In some cases, all radios support Type II, but in some cases, Type I radios might be used exclusively in subfleets while the Type IIs are used exclusively in talkgroups. 
The most common reason that an agency sets up a Type IIi Hybrid system is because they have newer Type II radios that they want to interoperate with older Type I radios, without having to create new Type II talkgroups.

Tracey Kibre is a fictional Homicide Bureau Chief ADA on Law & Order: Trial by Jury, portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth. She also appeared in the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode "Night". A tough, focused prosecutor, Kibre has worked for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for fifteen years and is a stark contrast to the Executive ADAs in the other three Law & Order series.http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20147001,00.htmlhttp://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/Law-Order-2005/episode-9-season-1/line/191616
Kibre has a black-and-white view of the law when it comes to those she prosecutes, and does take a few controversial turns in her cases. In one episode she indicated that she is not religious, unlike her partner Kelly Gaffney. Kibre always sits first chair as the lead prosecuting attorney in the cases she tries, most of which are homicides, though she once tried a high-profile rape case for the NYPD Special Victims Unit during a crossover special with Law & Order: Special Victims Unit when ADA Casey Novak was viciously attacked.
Kibre is also notable for her pathos-driven arguments. During a closing argument of a trial of a girl for causing the death of a baby from Shaken Baby Syndrome, Kibre brutally shakes a baby doll. When the judge objects, telling Kibre she will be in contempt of court, she smashes the doll's head into the barrier separating her from the jury (as she alleged the defendant had done).
Kibre also uses various means in her attempts to sway the jury to her side. In one case in which a man is prosecuted for murdering his son's girlfriend (a transsexual), Kibre has the murder victim's mother posthumously change her daughter's name to Angelina, the victim's adopted name. Kibre files a motion to have this name submitted to the court, thus necessitating the defense to refer to the victim by the preferred, female name to gain the jury's sympathy.

[[Opération Bison]]

CATEGORIES: History of Chad, Military operations involving France

Opération Bison is the name given to the French military operation in Chad in the years 1969–1972.
Chad was a former French colony that had become independent in 1960. In 1965 erupted the Chadian Civil War, and a year later the FROLINAT, an insurgent group, was formed to overthrow the Chadian President François Tombalbaye. By 1968 the revolt had extended to most of the country, and the FROLINAT could count on roughly 3000 men.[tpl]cite journal|author=Milburn, Sarah S.| title=Toujours la Chasse Gardée?: French Power and Influence in Late 20th Century Francophone Central Africa (c. 1970–1995)| journal=Columbia International Affairs|year=1998[/tpl]
This forced Tombalbaye to ask in 1968 for help from the French President Charles de Gaulle, counting on the military accords between the two countries; firstly, the Defence Accord signed on August 15, 1960, and secondly, the Assistance Militaire Technique (AMT) accord, signed May 19, 1964. Originally France limited itself to provide logistic support to the Chadian Armed Forces; but when it became clear the situation was not improving, De Gaulle reluctantly started on April 14, 1969 Operation Bison, sending 3000 well equipped French soldiers against the ragtag FROLINAT forces. Among the conditions for the French help was the acceptance by Tombalbaye of an Administrative Reform Mission (MRA), that was to reform the army and the civil service and propose radical changes to the government's policies.[tpl]cite web| title=Opération Epervier|url=http://pageperso.aol.fr/lipeulzeus/mapage/afrique.html[/tpl]
The command of the operation was at first given to General Michel Arnaud, a former companion of the General Philippe Leclerc. Tombalbaye immediately attempted him to dictate the mission of the Operation; for example it is reported that on one occasion, Tombalbaye summoned Arnauld to a meeting of the Defence Council and ordered him to eliminate all the Arabs living at N'Goura, a locality not far from the capital Fort-Lamy, because they didn't deserve to be called Chadians.

These tensions brought to Arnaud's replacement in September with General Edouard Cortadellas, who went on better with Tombalbaye. The French were militarily successful, constantly defeating the rebels; this, with the reforms of the MRA, contributed to the relative calm of 1970 and 1971, especially in central and eastern Chad, where the French concentrated themselves. By 1971 the rebels were for the most part active only in isolated pockets in the Tibesti, and Cortadellas himself admitted that the Toubou could not be fully submitted, when he said: "I believe we should draw a line below Tibesti Region and leave them to their stones. We can never subdue them."[tpl]cite web |author=Fearon, James & Laitan, David| year=2006| title=Chad - Random Narratives| work=Ethnicity, Insurgency and Civil War|format=PDF|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/ChadRN2.6.pdf[/tpl]
The French used against the insurgents tactics that emphasized the use of air power for ground support, similarly to what the United States was doing in those years in Vietnam. This helped the French win every engagement with the rebels, and especially useful were their 20 mm helicopter-mounted cannons.[tpl]cite book|author=R.

In July 1971 the French ceased direct military involvement, and on August 28, 1972 the operation was officially considered ended, as symbolized by the departure the same day of Cortadellas, with most of the troops. Cortadellas' place in Chad was taken by the General J.-H. Auffray, with a single French Marine regiment stationed in the capital and 600 army advisors, that were deployed in Chadian uniforms. The operation cost the lives of 50 Frenchmen (among whom was Cortadellas' son), but failed in destroying the insurgency, that promptly took new vigor when the French departed.
Auffray was to remain in command till October 1974, when he was replaced. In 1975 all remaining French were forced to leave Chad, because of a crisis in Franco-Chadian relations generated by the Claustre affaire. French troops were to return three years later with Opération Tacaud, again to save the government from the FROLINAT.[tpl]cite journal | author=De Lespinois, Jérôme| title = Emploi de la force aérienne - Tchad 1969–1987 | journal = Penser les Ailes françaises | issue = 6 | year = 2005 | pages = 70–72 | url = http://www.cesa.air.defense.gouv.fr/DPESA/PLAF/PLAF_N_6.pdf | format = PDF [/tpl]

Electronic packaging is a major discipline within the field of electronic engineering, and includes a wide variety of technologies.  It refers to enclosures and protective features built into the product itself, and not to shipping containers.  It applies both to end products and to components. Packaging of an electronic system must consider protection from mechanical damage, cooling, radio frequency noise emission, protection from electrostatic discharge, maintenance, operator convenience, and cost. Prototypes and industrial equipment made in small quantities may use standardized commercially available enclosures such as card cages or prefabricated boxes. Mass-market consumer devices may have highly specialized packaging to increase consumer appeal. The same electronic system may be packaged as a portable device or adapted for fixed mounting in an instrument rack or permanent installation. Packaging for aerospace, marine, or military systems imposes different types of design criteria.

[[One Big Happy]]
CATEGORIES: Comic strips started in the 1980s, 1988 in comics, American comic strips

One Big Happy is a daily comic strip written and illustrated by Rick Detorie, detailing the daily adventures of a six-year-old girl named Ruthie.  The strip also features her eight-year-old brother Joe, their parents Frank and Ellen, and their grandparents Nick and Rose, who live next door.  The strip's title is a takeoff on the phrase, "One big happy family."  It debuted on September 11, 1988. The strip takes place on Buena Vista Avenue and in an unspecified city based on Baltimore, Maryland, where the creator grew up. It is syndicated by Creators Syndicate.[tpl]cite news |first=Sam |last=Greenspan |publisher=11 Points |title=11 Questions With Rick Detorie, Cartoonist Behind One Big Happy |url=http://www.11points.com/Interviews/11_Questions_With_Rick_Detorie,_Cartoonist_Behind_One_Big_Happy |date=May 18, 2009[/tpl]
The strip focuses on the daily lives of the children and their interactions with their family, friends and neighbors.  Grandparents Nick and Rose are featured often, as they live next door and have a close relationship with the kids.  Together they watch television, play cards, bake, and participate in imaginative games.  Ruthie often visits the local public library for story hour with the Library Lady, and annoys her with ceaseless questions and variations on her own tales.  At school Ruthie dodges the affections of occasionally seen classmate Buggy Crispino (who thinks of himself a ladies man and has even complimented Ruthie's mom on her appearance), argues with her snotty rich friend Cylene, and she and Joe play with their ditzy friend James, a poor (and usually dirty) kid who lives down the street.
The strip has a number of recurring themes.  Ruthie runs her own art business, which she sets up in a stand with a sign that reads "Good Art By Ruthie, 10 cents." (the price was raised in the early 2000s from 5 cents). Ruthie also frequently misunderstands and misuses words she hears. Joe has a better handle on words, but often has trouble spelling them.  Grandma Rose has a tendency to meddle into other people's business and gossip, while Nick and Frank tell tall tales to entertain the children. Ellen operates a pottery business in the house. 
Originally the creator included two sets of grandparents, but broke it down to only one (Frank's side), with the other - and more eccentric - grandmother, Myrna, making guest appearances.  Joe's name was originally Frankie, but was changed to one that would take up less space.  Ruthie was created as a dark-haired little girl to balance the blond-haired little boys that were already popular in the comic pages.Introduction to All the Dirt!, 2001, NBM.
Joe describes his family as being "half Italian and half Texan." The Italian half comes from Nick, Rose, and Frank. Their family name is Lombard, a slightly Americanized version of the Italian family name Lombardo. Myrna and Ellen supply the Texan side. All the family members are colorful characters with strong opinions on everything. The same can be said for their neighbors. The most regular neighbor is old lady named Avis, gossipy and characterized by a perennial grin from ear to ear, who often meets Rose, Nick and/or Ruthie; the elderly couple only tolerate her for appearances, but do not think highly of her gossiping.

[[Let's Go to Bed (No Angels song)]]
CATEGORIES: 2002 singles, No Angels songs

"Let's Go to Bed" is a song performed by German pop group No Angels. It was written by Mousse T. and frequent collaborator Errol Rennalls for the band's second studio album Now... Us! (2002), while production was handled by the former. Musically, the track is a mid-paced pop song that is set in retro style. It contains heavy elements of psychedelic soul and funk music, with its instrumentation led by a bass guitar. "Let's Go to Bed" contains lyrics that reference to a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, leading up to a desire to invite a love interest to come to bed.
The song was well received by contemporary music critics, who noted it the album's standout track and felt it was a breakaway from the Europop genre widely associated with the group; they also praised its production. On November 4, 2002, a beat-heavy remix of "Let's Go to Bed" was released as the album's third single in German-speaking Europe by Polydor. It became the No Angels's first single to miss the top ten on the German Singles Chart when it peaked at number twelve. In Austria, the song barely reached the top fifty, while in Switzerland, the funk track failed to chart on the Swiss Singles Chart. Altogether, it sold more than 100,000 copies Europe-wide but emerged as the band's lowest-selling single before their disbandment in 2003.
The single's accompanying music video was directed by Marcus Sternberg and filmed inside the New Trade Fair building in Leipzig in early October 2002. It features the girls in black dresses seductively dancing in front of architecture by Gerkan, Marg and Partners and Ian Ritchie Architects. Mousse T. makes a cameo appearance in the video.

CATEGORIES: Human rights organizations, Non-governmental organizations, Non-profit organizations based in Virginia, Organizations established in 1997

The Tahirih Justice Center, known simply as Tahirih, is a United States-based non-governmental organization (NGO) that provides pro bono direct legal services and social and medical service referrals to immigrant women and girls who are fleeing from gender-based violence and persecution. Tahirih helps women who are attempting to escape from such abuse as female genital cutting, domestic violence, human trafficking, torture and rape. The organization also conducts public policy initiatives designed to achieve legislative change for women fleeing from human rights abuses, to highlight problems faced by immigrant women in the United States, and to end the possible exploitation of mail-order brides by international marriage brokers. In 2007, the Tahirih Justice Center won the The Washington Post Award for Excellence in Nonprofit Management.Tahirih Justice Center Wins The Washington Post 2007 Award for Excellence in Nonprofit Management 13th Annual Award Announced June 20 In 2012, Tahirih’s executive director won the Diane Von Furstenberg Choice Award.
Layli Miller-Muro founded the Tahirih Justice Center in 1997 following a well-publicized asylum case in which she was involved as a student attorney.Fauziya Kassindja, Do They Hear You When You Cry. p. 171. The case name became Matter of Kasinga, because Fauziya did not know if it was proper to correct the immigration official who misspelled her last name on her entry into the United States. Miller-Muro later co-wrote a book with the client she had aided and used her portion of the proceeds for the initial funding of Tahirih. As of 2012, the organization had assisted more than 13,000 women and children fleeing from a wide variety of abuses.Services Tahirih Justice Center, Retrieved June 6, 2012 The organization played a significant role in the passage of the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act (IMBRA), which was signed by President Bush in early 2006 and incorporated into the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).  IMBRA gives foreign women important information about prospective American husbands (for a summary, see also Mail-order bride, Legal issues).
The organization is named after Táhirih, an influential female poet and theologian in 19th-century Persia who campaigned for women's rights. Tahirih is a Bahá'í-inspired organization, although its clients and employees vary widely in ethnicity, religious identification, and nationality.

The Matter of Kasinga was a legal case decided in June 1996 involving Fauziya Kassindja (surname also spelled as Kasinga), a Togolese teenager seeking asylum in the United States in order to escape a tribal practice of female genital mutilation.Dugger, Celia W. "Asylum from Mutilation". New York Times. 16 June 2006. Retrieved 8 August 2008. The Board of Immigration Appeals granted her asylum in June 1996 after an earlier judge denied her claims. The case set a precedent in United States immigration law as applicants could now seek asylum in the United States from gender-based persecution, whereas previously religious or political grounds were often used to grant asylum. 
Layli Miller-Muro, the student attorney who represented Kassindja before the immigration judge, subsequently founded the Tahirih Justice Center to provide legal aid and medical referrals to immigrant women escaping from gender-based violence and persecution. Karen Musalo, who spearheaded the litigation leading to the Board's positive decision in the case, founded the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies (CGRS), a national organization based at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, which works to defend women refugees fleeing gender-based persecution. Kassindja (aka  Kasinga) is a member of the CGRS Advisory Board.  [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

Layli Miller-Muro is the Executive Director of the Tahirih Justice Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting women from human rights abuses through the provision of legal aid and public policy advocacy. Miller-Muro founded the organization in 1997 following her involvement in Matter of Kasinga, a high-profile case that set national precedent and revolutionized asylum law in the United States.  Fauziya Kassindja—a 17-year-old girl who had fled Togo in fear of a forced polygamous marriage and a tribal practice known as female genital mutilation—was granted asylum in 1996 by the US Board of Immigration Appeals. This decision opened the door to gender-based persecution as grounds for asylum. Using her portion of the proceeds from a book she and Kassindja co-authored about the case (Do They Hear You When You Cry? Delacorte Press, 1998), Miller-Muro established Tahirih. She has received many accolades for her work with Tahirih. In 2012, she was named one of Newsweek/The Daily Beast[tpl]'[/tpl]s 150 Most Fearless Women in the World and received the Diane Von Furstenberg Choice Award. Prior to joining Tahirih as Executive Director in 2001, Miller-Muro was an attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm of Arnold & Porter where she practiced international litigation and maintained a substantial pro bono practice. Prior to joining Arnold & Porter, Miller-Muro was an attorney-advisor at the U.S. Department of Justice, Board of Immigration Appeals.

[[Kelly Gaffney]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional American people of Irish descent, Fictional lawyers, Fictional characters from New York City, Law & Order: Trial by Jury characters, Fictional characters introduced in 2005

Kelly Gaffney is a fictional character portrayed by Amy Carlson on the television program Law & Order: Trial by Jury. She was named after Dick Wolf's mother, whose maiden name was Gaffney.
Gaffney is a Manhattan assistant district attorney, consistently working alongside Tracey Kibre (Bebe Neuwirth).  Of the two ADAs, Gaffney is the younger assistant who comes from an Irish Catholic family with a history that runs deep in the City of New York. Gaffney is a graduate of Boston College, and is often more by-the-book when it came to law and its application than her superior.  She often challenges Kibre in pertinence to cases they prosecute, and sees the law in more shades of gray than her partner.  
Gaffney always sits second-chair to Kibre while prosecuting. Her role during trials is limited, as Kibre often tries the entirety of most cases the pair prosecute. Gaffney's role is often most significantly played out at the crime scene investigation at the start of the show, at which point she often goes to the crime scene and interviews those who either witnessed the crime around which the show is set to revolve or were in the vicinity of the crime scene during its occurrence.  The two prosecutors usually try homicides, though they try a high-profile rape during a crossover with Law & Order: Special Victims Unit when ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal) is viciously attacked.
Gaffney is more idealistic than Kibre. In one episode, for example, a jury returns a verdict of guilty in a case in which a babysitter is charged with murder due to Shaken Baby Syndrome. The judge, however, overrides the ruling, at which point Gaffney suggests to Kibre that they need to do something, whether it be filing an appeal or having the judge transferred to Staten Island Traffic Court.  Kibre tells Gaffney that all they can do is move on.

Route 39 originally continued westward, crossing the Yardley–Wilburtha Bridge in the community of Wilburtha, New Jersey near State Highway Route 29. 
Route 39 was designated in the 1927 1927 state highway renumbering to a previously unnumbered highway. The route produced one spur route, Route S39, which became Route 68 in the 1953 renumbering. The Route 39 designation was removed in the 1953 renumbering to eliminate the concurrency with US 206. It was also a proposed designation for a northern beltway around Trenton; this beltway is now Interstate 295 and Interstate 95.

[[Aylestone Road]]
CATEGORIES: Cricket grounds in Leicestershire, Sport in Leicester

Aylestone Road is a cricket stadium in Leicester, England. 
It was for many years the home to Leicestershire County Cricket Club. It was first used in 1901 after it was decided that Grace Road was too far from the centre of the city. It hosted 401 first-class cricket games during its time; 398 of them were held before the Second World War. 
The ground was damaged during the war and was also partially used for industrial development, so the county side returned to Grace Road from 1946. Nevertheless, Leicestershire did play two Championship matches at Aylestone Road in 1957 and a final game in 1962 against Cambridge University. 
The ground is still used for cricket. Its playing area is greatly reduced, but the pavilion still stands. It is now used by local men's and youth cricketers' teams. The ground also has the names 'Greyfriars Sports and Social Club' and 'The Leicester Electricity Sports'. It is on a uniquely named road - Raw Dykes Road, referring to the remains of a Roman aqueduct in south Leicester.http://www.electricitysports.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=27.

Tropical Storm Danielle was a weak tropical storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth storm of the season, Danielle was one of two tropical cyclones in the year to make landfall in the United States, the other being Hurricane Andrew. It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina. The system quickly reached tropical storm status, and Danielle looped to the west due to a change in steering currents. Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65 mph (105 km/h) winds before weakening and hitting the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm quickly dissipated over land.
The storm dropped light rainfall throughout its path, and winds were minimal. The combination of Danielle and a high pressure system produced higher than normal tides and strong waves, causing beach erosion and light coastal damage. The waves killed two in New Jersey from a boat sinking, and also destroyed three houses in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Overall damage from the storm was minimal.

Keshi (Japanese: 消し or ケシ) aka keshigomu (消しゴム, for Keshi Gum) is the Japanese word for eraser. Modern reference to "keshi" is related to a collectible manga/anime character mini figure made of coloured hard gum. However, keshi is not restrictive to its etymology but a generic term as several gum types are used, from matte to transparent. Also, some lines, such as the "Cosmos Souls Keshi Gum" (コスモスザウルス消しゴム, kosumosu saurusu keshi gomu) uses plastic parts. Keshi figures are not necessarily based on Japanese comic book nor TV series franchises, since there are keshi dedicated to video games (Super Mario, Zelda, etc.) and some western lines are based on local mythologies and popular culture. A similar product is often mistaken with keshi, the pencil cap toy (ペンシル キャップ, penshiru kyappu) which appeared around the same period.

[[Galapagos shark]]
CATEGORIES: Carcharhinidae, Fish of Hawaii

The Galapagos shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis) is a species of requiem shark, family Carcharhinidae, found worldwide. This species favors clear reef environments around oceanic islands, where it is often the most abundant shark species. A large species that often reaches [tpl]convert|3.0|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], the Galapagos reef shark has a typical fusiform "reef shark" shape and is very difficult to distinguish from the dusky shark (C. obscurus) and the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). An identifying character of this species is its tall first dorsal fin, which has a slightly rounded tip and originates over the rear tips of the pectoral fins.
Galapagos sharks are active predators often encountered in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals have a much more varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 4–16 pups every 2–3 years. The juveniles tend to remain in shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.

[[Fermentum]]
CATEGORIES: Eucharist in the Catholic Church, Eucharist

Fermentum is a practice of the Early Christian Church whereby bishops affirmed their communion with one another.Encyclopedia.Com: Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia, pg. 437 The rite of committing consists of placing a small particle of the consecrated Bread into the chalice. This custom derives from the fermentum practice (literally, "leaven"). The fermentum was originally part of the Eucharistic Bread consecrated by the Pope in Rome (as attested in the letter of Pope St. Innocent 1 in A.D. 416 to Bishop Decentius of Gubbio) and then sent to the various tituli (parish churches) in the city to denote the unity of the one Catholic community despite their having to celebrate separate Eucharists.
The custom of the fermentum was first practiced as early as 120 AD. A particle of the Eucharistic bread was carried by a minister of the Church from the bishop of one diocese to the bishop of another diocese. The receiving bishop would then consume the species at his next celebration of the Eucharist as a sign of the communion between the churches. The term fermentum  was likely a reference to the Eucharist as the leaven of the Christian life, and as the instrument by which Christians spread throughout the world were united in the one Body of Christ as a leaven to the world.Encyclopedia.Com: Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia, pg. 255 The origins of this rite commixture are to be found in fermentum, during which a piece of the consecrated Bread was broken off and sent to be part of another Eucharistic celebration to show the essential unity of the Church in the Eucharistic Sacrifice. When this was no longer done, the piece was dropped into the chalice and medieval allegorical explanations were developed to explain the practice.
In the 2nd century, popes sent the Eucharist to other bishops as a pledge of unity of faith, this being the origin of the expression to be in communion with each other, and such communion already considered essential to Christianity in the 2nd-century writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch and St. Irenaeus. On occasion, bishops also sent out fermenti to their priests.Eusebius of Caesarea's Church History, Book 5, Chapter 24, Paragraph 17 But though matters were in this shape, they communed together, and Anicetus conceded the administration of the eucharist in the church to Polycarp, manifestly as a mark of respect. And they parted from each other in peace, both those who observed, and those who did not, maintaining the peace of the whole church.
John. D. Zizioulas (the Metropolitan of Pergamon) in his doctoral thesis (1964 University of Athens) takes the position that by the mid-3rd century the Bishops were exercising fermentum with the (local to the Metropolitan) parishes that did have a presiding Bishop in order to communicate/retain the unity of the Church under the Bishop.  While this was due to the growth of the Christian church it is also due to extensive persecution of the Church, especially aimed at the Bishops.

The Tammy movies are a series of four light-hearted American films about a naive 18-year-old girl from Mississippi produced by Universal between 1957 and 1967. The main character of the movies is Tambrey "Tammy" Tyree, portrayed as a sweet and polite country girl looking for romantic love. Some elements common to each film are: Tammy falling in love; Tammy singing about being in love; Tammy being hurt by sophisticated city folk; city folk learning something from Tammy; Tammy "puckering up" and then comparing the kiss with her first kiss; Tammy praying to God and talking to her grandmother; Tammy quoting from the Bible; and Tammy relating the wisdom of her grandfather, a lay-preacher and moonshiner. Tammy's speech is stereotypical of dialects of the rural Deep South.
The films formed the basis of a later television series, simply called Tammy.

Barry Beath (born in Eugowra, New South Wales) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer, a second-row forward for the St. George Dragons in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership competition. He represented for New South Wales and in the Australia national rugby league team. 
Beath was first selected in 1965 for New South Wales and Australia from Country Representative honours while playing for Eugowra. In 1966 he joined St George in the  final year of their 11 year premiership run. Beath had his own 11 year run with the Dragons from 1966 to 1977, with the distinction of winning a premiership in his first and last years with the club. He came on as reserve in the 1977 Grand Final win.
He represented Australia again in 1971 having played in the Dragons Grand Final loss that year to South Sydney where he scored a try.
Barry made the news in 1999 at a post-match Cronulla Leagues Club function when he stepped in to defend a young St George supporter whose jersey was defaced by Cronulla President Peter Gow wielding scissors in an ill advised practical joke which ultimately resulted in Gow's resignation as club President. Gow is the father of Australian supermodel and actress Elle Macpherson. He lost several fingers when he moved his lawn mower by picking it up when it was still running.
The term "Barry Beath" is a localised rhyming slang colloquialism meaning "teeth" that might be used by a small number of Sydneysiders who grew up in the 60s or 70s and were familiar with Rugby League.

CATEGORIES: Cobalt compounds, Inorganic compounds, Chlorides, Metal halides, Coordination compounds, Octahedral compounds

Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula Co(NH3)6Cl3.  This coordination compound is considered an archetypal "Werner complex", named after the pioneer of coordination chemistry, Alfred Werner. This salt consists of Co(NH3)63+ trications with three Cl− anions.  The term "ammine" refers to ammonia in its metal complexes, and the prefix hex (Greek: six) indicates that there are six ammonias per cation. 
Originally this compound was described as a "luteo" (Latin: yellow) complex, but this name has been discarded as modern chemistry considers color less important than molecular structure. Other similar complexes also had color names, such as purpureo (Latin: purple) for a pentammine complex, and praseo (Greek: green) and violeo (Latin: violet) for two isomeric tetrammine complexes.

[[Scar Tissue (book)]]

CATEGORIES: 2004 books, Music autobiographies

Scar Tissue is the autobiography of Red Hot Chili Peppers vocalist Anthony Kiedis. It was released in 2004 by Hyperion and authored by Kiedis with Larry Sloman, who compiled information and interviewed various parties associated with the plot line. The story follows Kiedis from his birth in 1962 to the (then) present day of early 2004. It follows Kiedis into the depth of his experiences with drug addiction. The title name was taken from the single "Scar Tissue" released five years earlier on the Red Hot Chili Peppers album Californication.
According to the book, Kiedis' first drug experience was with his father Blackie Dammett, a former drug dealer, at age eleven. By the time his band formed and became more popular in the 1980s, he and former bandmate Hillel Slovak had severe drug addictions. On Slovak's death from overdose in 1988, Kiedis writes that he was so shaken that he skipped town, missing the funeral. Kiedis had no idea what to do without his friend. His death only made matters worse, and caused him to do more and more hardcore drugs.Kiedis, Anthony. Scar Tissue. 1st ed. New York: New York, 2004. 50-52. Print. He attempted to get clean afterwards but relapsed in 1994 after being given medications while getting a tooth pulled.  Later on, he reveals that he was not actually clean, as he claimed at the time, during the late-nineties Californication era of the band's existence. He claims his new clean date is December 24, 2000. The book reports very specific dates, such as when Kiedis was conceived.
The book reached a high of #1 on The New York Times Best Seller List.
Kiedis is working to develop a television series for HBO based on Scar Tissue.
On October 14, 2011 it was announced that FX has picked up the rights to produce Scar Tissue and that Entourage producers, Marc Abrams and Mike Benson will produce the series. The series is expected to follow the first half of the book during Anthony's pre teen and teenage years and his relationship with his father Blackie.http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Anthony-Kiedis-Scar-Tissue-Moves-From-HBO-FX-36054.html

A cold wave (known in some regions as cold snap) is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the U.S. National Weather Service, a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24 hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cold-wave1|title=Cold Wave|publisher=AMS - Glossary of Meteorology|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl]

The N-terminal two helices are antiparallel and the longer C-terminal helix is roughly perpendicular to the axes established by the first two. It is this third helix that interacts directly with DNA. Homeodomain folds are found exclusively in eukaryotes but have high homology to lambda phage proteins that alter the expression of genes in prokaryotes. Many homeodomains induce cellular differentiation by initiating the cascades of coregulated genes required to produce individual tissues and organs, while homeodomain proteins like NANOG are involved in maintaining pluripotency.

The Qingdao International Sailing Centre ([tpl]zh|s=青岛奥林匹克帆船中心|t=青島奧林匹克帆船中心|p=Qīngdǎo Àolínpǐkè Fānchuán Zhōngxīn[/tpl]) is a sailing marina located on the former site of the Beihai Shipyard by Qingdao's Fushan Bay at Shandong Province in China. It was constructed for the 2008 Summer Olympics. It hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Sailing competitions. Wind conditions vary greatly from very light winds to +15knots. During the Olympic competitions, fog was also an occasional factor. 
The venue hosted “Good Luck Beijing - 2006" and in May 2008, the IFDS Qingdao International Regatta, where Olympic and Paralympic sailors got a headstart on familiarizing themselves with the venue and weather conditions.
Access from the Qingdao Paralympic Village to the dock, work areas, etc. was provided by numerous golf carts making endless daytime rounds. Both ends of the work area had 2 cranes apiece, which could lift large keelboats like the Sonar from cradles and lower these into the water. At night, a laser light show from the main breakwater lighthouse would play from early evening to midnight. Facing the Yellow Sea, the main breakwater with spectator seating, windmills, flags and lighthouse was also the viewing area for the sailing competitions when not on the spectator ferry. Across the bay, the famous May 4th monument and Qingdao's landmark seaside building are easily visible.
The Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center covers 45 hectares, comprising a 30 hectare competition area and 15 hectare area for development after the Games. The seven facilities, include the Qingdao Sub-Village, Athletes Center, Administrative Center, Venue Media Center, Logistics Center, Reception Center and Accreditation Center.
Ground was broken on May 25, 2004 and was completed in 2008.

[[Linden Grove Cemetery]]

Linden Grove Cemetery is located along Holman Street, between 13th and 15th streets in Covington, Kentucky, United States. It is the second public cemetery in Covington, the city's first public burial ground being Craig Street Cemetery, which dates to 1815. Craig Street Cemetery closed in 1872. Most of the bodies were moved to Linden Grove. 
Trustees of the nearby Western Baptist Theological Institute which was formed to train Baptist ministers founded the cemetery in 1842, and from the beginning allowed burials without regard to race or religion. The Western Baptist Theological Institute had been formed in 1833 to train Baptist ministers and at one time its grounds covered several hundred acres.
Some accounts say burials at Linden Grove began in 1842, but the Licking Valley Register reported on September 9, 1843, that elaborate plans had been proposed for dedicating "this beautiful spot of ground" on September 11. Plans called for music and talks by ministers and groups from Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist churches in Covington.
The writer described Linden Grove as about "60 acres of high table land, overlooking the city of Cincinnati and situated in the midst of the most quiet and romantic scenery." The newspaper reporter concluded, "A place like this, in the vicinity of Cincinnati, would be thronged with the admirers of nature and art thus happily combined." A later account said a large crowd attended the dedication ceremonies.
As early as May 1851, The Covington Journal was cautioning lot owners to get more involved in the operation of the cemetery and warned that indifference was sure to lead to problems. Another Covington Journal account on May 1, 1858, noted that since its opening, Linden Grove had had more than 2,000 burials. Especially heavy years were 1850 and 1851, when cholera swept through the area. Those years there were more than 260 burials, compared to 160 in most other years.
Vandalism had become enough of a problem by 1859 that newspaper advertisements were run in the Covington Journal warning of fines of $5 to $50 for damaging grave sites. By 1868, Covington Journal accounts said another public burial site might soon be needed for Covington. The December 26 story said the Craig Street site had been full for several years and Linden Grove was quickly filling up. Highland Cemetery in Fort Mitchell would later be dedicated on June 26, 1869, to handle those needs.
Alben Barkley, the former Vice President and U.S. senator, was the guest speaker at the 1953 Memorial Day ceremonies at Linden Grove. The Norman-Barnes Post of the American Legion served as Barkley's escort during the ceremonies. That Covington post later sponsored placement of a marker dedicated to Civil War veterans buried at Linden Grove.
Among those moved to Linden Grove was Thomas Kennedy, one of the founders of Covington. The cemetery's residents also include three former Northern Kentucky congressmen, including John G. Carlisle,[tpl]cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IuGCoLRCN-kC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The WPA Guide to Kentucky | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | date=1996 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Federal Writers' Project | pages=154[/tpl] namesake of an elementary school in Covington; William Wright Southgate; John W. Menzies; and William Evans Arthur.  
Linden Grove is the resting place of many Civil War veterans, including eighteen in colored units of the United States Army. Union and Confederate soldiers are buried facing each other in uniform rows.  Two monuments to the war, the Veteran's Monument in Covington and the GAR Monument in Covington, are inside the cemetery, and like the cemetery, are on the National Register of Historic Places.
The cemetery has been in receivership for half a century, with the city and Kenton County charged with overseeing it.
On September 8, 2006, the Kentucky Governor's Office of Local Development announced a grant of $23,863.00, to be combined with $44,000.00 from the City of Covington, $22,000.00 from the Kenton County Fiscal Court and $5,500.00 from the Cemetery. These monies will be used for new fencing on West 13th Street and Linden Avenue. 
In 2003, $25,000 from the Cemetery Preservation Fund and $85,000 in local money was used to replace fencing along Kavanaugh Street.

CATEGORIES: Eucharist in the Catholic Church, Latin hymns, Compositions by César Franck

[tpl]Lang|la|Panis angelicus[/tpl] (Latin for "Bread of Angels" or "Angelic Bread") is the penultimate strophe of the hymn "[tpl]Lang|la|Sacris solemniis[/tpl]" written by Saint Thomas Aquinas for the Feast of Corpus Christi as part of a complete liturgy of the feast, including prayers for the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours.
The strophe of "[tpl]Lang|la|Sacris solemniis[/tpl]" that begins with the words "[tpl]Lang|la|Panis angelicus[/tpl]" (bread of angels) has often been set to music separately from the rest of the hymn. Most famously, in 1872 César Franck set this strophe for tenor voice, harp, cello, and organ, and incorporated it into his [tpl]Lang|fr|Messe à trois voix[/tpl], Op. 12.
Other hymns for Corpus Christi by Saint Thomas where sections have been separately set to music are "[tpl]Lang|la|Verbum supernum prodiens[/tpl]" (the last two strophes begin with "[tpl]Lang|la|O salutaris Hostia[/tpl]") and "[tpl]Lang|la|Pange lingua gloriosi[/tpl]" (the last two strophes begin with "[tpl]Lang|la|Tantum ergo[/tpl]").

Love Jones is an American band, in Louisville, Kentucky in spring 1990 by Ben Daughtrey (drummer) and Barry Thomas (bassist), with Chris Hawpe (singer/guitarist), Stuart Johnson (drummer) and Jonathan Palmer (singer).  According to Entertainment Weekly, Love Jones was the leader of the "cocktail nation" groups of the early 1990s. These groups, which included Combustible Edison, Nightcaps, Squirrel Nut Zippers and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy were a reaction to the grunge/alternative wave that swept through America in 1992.  Cocktail Nation members celebrated the aesthetics and music of the 1950s and early 1960s — lounge jazz, crooning pop, and martinis. Love Jones played any sort of pop music that could fit that label — pop, blues, R&B, bossa nova, doo wop.
Love Jones started in Louisville in 1990 along with bands like Slint and Palace Brothers, showing the diversity of the Louisville music scene.  In 1992 Love Jones moved to Los Angeles and took up a Thursday night residency at the nightclub Largo for a weekly show that featured guest performers like Jon Brion and Mark Flanagan, who eventually performed on Love Jones recordings.

Due to her dark complexion and personality, she was given the nickname "La Diosa de Ébano" (The Ebony Goddess) by the Dominican public and press.El Anecdotario
At the Miss Universe 2002 pageant, held in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Ocumárez was predicted by many to be place as a semifinalist.  She did not place, causing many internet users and bloggers to coin the term the Ruth Ocumárez Award to signify a pageant contestant who seems guaranteed to be a finalist, but does not make the list at the end.El Anecdotario
After her reign was over, Ocumárez entered the world of modeling and appeared in many Dominican, European, and Puerto Rican periodicals. She also branched out into acting, starring in the Dominican film Perico Ripiao. Besides her work in film, Ocumárez also has experience as a television hostess on Puerto Rican television.  
It was reported in 2007 that Ocumárez had become engaged to flamboyant entertainment personality Sixto Nolasco. Nolasco, who was interviewed by journalist Carmen Jovet declared that he was   "tired of being gay," and that he intends to start a family with his new wife. As of January 2008, there has been no date for the proposed nuptials.Quiero Morir al lado de una Mujer from Primera Hora dated July 21, 2007

The other birds who fly close to the ground are jealous.  The brolga tell the emu that if its wings were made smaller it would be able to fly even higher, and because the emu wants to fly higher it lets the other birds trim its wings.

The 8th Cavalry Regiment was constituted 28 July 1866 and organized as a regiment on 21 September 1866 at Camp Reynolds, Angel Island, California. Enlisted personnel were "composed chiefly of men enlisted on the Pacific Coast, and included many of the class styled 'Forty-niners'; men who had worked months or years in the mines and were typical specimens of the roving order of citizens. Many of them were wild characters who enlisted in the same spirit of adventure which led them to the frontier, and typically had difficulty in adapting themselves to the conformity of a military life." Many desertions occurred; the percentage rose to 41 by the end of 1867.Charles O'Connor, "The Eighth Regiment of Cavalry," The Army of the United States (Maynard, Merrill & Co., 1896), p. 268. The officers assigned to the regiment were all veterans of the Civil War. The first colonel was John Irvin Gregg, and the first lieutenant colonel was Thomas Devin, both of whom had been generals and commanded cavalry divisions during the war. The Eighth Cavalry served on the Frontier during the late 19th century.
On 13 September 1921, with the initiation of the National Defense Act, the 1st Cavalry Division was formally activated at Fort Bliss, Texas. The first unit of the 1st Cavalry Division, the famous 1st Cavalry Regiment, had been preassigned to the 1st Division on 20 August 1921, nearly a month before the formal divisional activation date. Upon formal activation, the 7th, 8th and 10th Cavalry Regiments were assigned to the new division.
The Eighth Cavalry continued to serve under a number of different designations, fighting in Korea and Vietnam as well as taking part in current conflicts. Originally organized as horse cavalry, it served as infantry during World War II and Korea, converting to airmobile infantry during Vietnam. It converted to a mechanized force in the 1970s.

CATEGORIES: Toyota vehicles, Rear-wheel-drive vehicles

The Toyota AE85, sold as the Toyota Corolla Levin, Toyota Sprinter Trueno or Toyota Corolla SR5 is a rear-wheel drive sportscoupe manufactured by Toyota from 1983-1987. The AE85 shares its chassis and basic design with the famous AE86, but while the AE86 was designed for performance, the AE85 was designed for economy and differs mainly in its engine.
The inaugural AE85 model's standard equipment included Toyota's 3A-U carburetor-equipped SOHC motor displacing 1286cc(cubic centimeter) and the cable-clutch transmission. It did not incorporate the hydraulic T-50 transmission, nor the limited-slip differential (LSD) and rear disc brakes of the higher-performing AE86 version of the car. Both AE85 and AE86 were available in coupe or hatchback form, and also with the fixed headlight front (Levin) or pop-up lights (Trueno.) Because of their identical outward appearance, the two can sometimes be mistaken. The Corolla Levin was unique to Toyota Japan retail sales channel called Toyota Corolla Store, and the Sprinter Trueno was available new only at Toyota Vista Store locations.
The A Series engines are a family of straight-4 internal combustion engines with displacement from 1.3 L to 1.8 L produced by Toyota Motor Corporation.
The car is known in Japan as the [tpl]nihongo|Hachi-Go|ハチゴー[/tpl], meaning "Eight-Five". The word "trueno" is Spanish for thunder, and "levin" is Old English for "lightning".
It is most famously featured in the manga/anime series Initial D, where Itsuki Takeuchi purchases an AE85 Levin, mistaken for an AE86.

It was founded in 1946 under the name Music Vendor, but in 1964 it was changed to Record World, under the ownership of Sid Parnes and Bob Austin. It ceased publication in April 1982. Many music industry personalities, writers and critics began their careers there in the early 1970s to 1980s.[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Record World was considered the hipper, faster-moving music industry publication[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl], in contrast to the stodgier Billboard and the perennially-struggling Cash Box. A weekly, like its competitors, it was housed in New York City at 1700 Broadway, at 53rd Street, just across the street from the Ed Sullivan Theater, and West Coast editorial offices in L.A. on Sunset & Vine. Rock bands frequented Record World's offices as part of their promotional tours, often leaving questionable promo items in their wake. The band Hot Rats, for instance, presented each writer with a freeze-dried and shrink-wrapped rat to remember them by.
Record World showed musical diversity by printing a "Non-Rock" survey, comparable to Billboard's "Easy Listening" chart. This chart appeared 2/4/67 and disappeared essentially 5 years later, 2/5/72, having morphed to the name "The MOR Chart" by 1971. Several titles of interest appeared on this 40 position list without making the Billboard MOR survey.
Record World's peak years coincided with the Studio 54 era, when disco was in full swing. Recording artists tottered through on platform heels, bedecked in rhinestones, often seriously impaired by the then-popular recreational drug cocaine. Young writers labored far into the night writing reviews of records, analyses of sales data and music-related current events. Staffers included Mike Sigman, editor-in-chief (who then went on to become publisher of the L.A. Weekly); Howie Levitt, managing editor (later of Billboard and BMI, the music royalty service); Pat Baird, who went on to key publicity positions at both RCA and BMI; (Mike Vallone, editor, charts and statistics; associate editor Allen Levy, who went to become a public relations person for United Artists Records, ASCAP and A&M, and who is now a professor of mass communication at Chapman University; art directors Mitchell Kanner, who went on to become Director of Artist Development for Elektra/Asylum Records Records and later Art Director for PolyGram Records, Michael Schanzer, later Stephen Kling and David Ray Skinner; and writers Vince Aletti (later of The New Yorker); Marc Kirkeby (he went on to CBS/Sony Records); Jeffrey Peisch (later of MTV and independent producing); Dave McGee (later of Rolling Stone); Laurie Lennard (later as a talent booker on The Late Show, then wife of comedian Larry David, and producer of Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth); columnist Sophia Midas; and chart editor and asst. editor Fred Goodman (later editor of "Cashbox" and current managing editor of "Pro Sound News" and a songwriter/music publisher); among many others.
Record World's collapse was the result of discord between the two owners[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl], and a sudden downturn in record sales.
In 2012, it was announced that much of the history of Record World (and its predecessor publication, Music Vendor) would be chronicled in a 1954-1982 volume produced by Joel Whitburn's Record Research, long associated with Billboard presentations. The book was distributed in September 2012.[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl]
A second volume, featuring the Music Vendor/Record World "Beat Of The Week" charts (similar to Billboard's "Bubbling Under"), spotlighting positions 101-150, was announced in November, 2012.[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl]
In 2013, Bruce Elrod reactivated Record World Magazine as a sister publication of Cash Box Magazine. The new Record World is geared solely to independent artists and labels.

Woodstock Express is a wooden roller coaster located at Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina.  It was formerly named after the Nickelodeon cartoon The Fairly OddParents.  Though containing all of the elements of a "full-size" or standard wooden roller coaster, its short drop heights, slower speed, gently curving layout and short track length lead to its mistaken identity as a 'junior roller coaster'.

[[Jaime Legato]]
CATEGORIES: 1971 births, Living people, People from Dayton, Ohio, American folk musicians

Jaime Legato is one of the more diverse musicians in popular music. He is perhaps best known as a founding member of Giant Jerk, one of the leaders of the American-based improvisational folk movement of the mid-1990s. 
Legato was born in Toledo, Ohio, on January 24, 1971. He and his younger brother, Shirc (b. 1972), were classically trained in piano and violin respectively. They formed many rock bands together in their early years, usually with Shirc playing guitar and Jaime playing bass.
After Shirc graduated high school in 1991, the brothers moved to Dayton, Ohio, where they met up with singer, Thaddeus Floodgate (b. 1970), another Toledo transplant. Along with percussionist DJ Kwapich (b. 1972), they formed Kilgore Trout, named after the character in Kurt Vonnegut novels. Kilgore Trout had modest success in the Midwest, perhaps capitalizing on the national success of more mature local acts like Guided by Voices, The Breeders and Brainiac. The band effectively dissolved in 1994, with Jaime and Shirc moving to Orlando, Florida and Thaddeus moving to Boulder, Colorado.
Despite their distance, they continued to share ideas through home recordings and occasional visits to each other. Jaime and Shirc had formed Blee Mind Thrice, a complex, arrangement-heavy power trio with percussionist Stue Trory (b. 1972), while Thaddeus started writing songs with writer/poet Jan Rigket (b. 1972). The thousands of hours of recordings made during the period of 1994-2007 comprised the bulk of what would eventually become Giant Jerk. By the end of 1998, Shirc, Thaddeus and Jan had moved back to the Midwest to start families while Jaime and Stue remained in Florida and formed the drum and bass combo, The Ray Yeller Zero. The Giant Jerk tapes literally sat in a closet at Jaime's mother's house for several years.
Jaime moved to Los Angeles in 2001, where he met publisher G. Albert Earl (b. 1971), who took an unusual interest in the Giant Jerk tapes. Earl marvelled at Rigket's lyrical content and was impressed with the variety of Legato's recordings, so much so that he started giving Jaime a monthly stipend to help publish the Giant Jerk material under Earl's label, Dermusik, as well as any future material. With his finances somewhat secure, Jaime relocated to Detroit, Michigan to be closer to Shirc and the other Giant Jerks. Little by little, Giant Jerk recordings have made their way around the internet and to people in the independent music community, but there have never been plans for individual releases. Rather, in 2010, Earl plans to release their entire collection of recordings at once in a 12 disc box set appropriately titled, Commercial Suicide.
These days, Jaime Legato is involved with the musical act Sleepybird, videographers Der Brudders Der and dance ensemble Hello Hello.

[[San Fernando High School]]

San Fernando High School is a secondary school that is a part of the Los Angeles Unified School District. It is located in the Pacoima area of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley region, near the City of San Fernando."Auditorium to Be Named for Chavez." Los Angeles Times. June 10, 2000. Retrieved on April 27, 2014.
The school colors are black and gold. All female teams are referred to as "Lady Tigers"; all male teams simply as the "Tigers". It is the only high school in California with Project G.R.A.D.(Graduation Really Achieves Dreams). San Fernando High School also hosts the Puente Project, a national-award winning program which has claimed to have assisted thousands of students in reaching their dreams of college success.
The City of San Fernando is zoned to the school. Originally more of the Pacoima area was assigned to the school, but much of it was reassigned to Arleta High School when that school opened in 2006. The San Fernando Gardens public housing complex in Pacoima is assigned to San Fernando High School.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Plans to bring the school to a traditional calendar in 2009, rather than the "year-round" calendar, have surfaced recently. With the opening of numerous new senior high schools in the San Fernando Valley relieving overpopulation in area schools, the plan has been described as being possible. Apparently, that was obvious to officials as well, because in March 2008 it was announced by current school principal Ken Lee that San Fernando High School would start on a traditional calendar in fall of that year. This calendar would allow all three tracks (A, B, and C-track; roughly 3300 students in total) to join as one in September 2008, as well as make it impossible for the city's planned charter middle school to take residence within the school grounds.

Telephone banking is a service provided by a bank or other financial institution, that enables customers to perform financial transactions over the telephone, without the need to visit a bank branch or automated teller machine. Telephone banking times can be longer than branch opening times, and some financial institutions offer the service on a 24 hour basis. From the bank's point of view, telephone banking reduces the cost of handling transactions by reducing the need for customers to visit a bank branch for non-cash withdrawal and deposit transactions.

[[Sinkbox]]

CATEGORIES: Hunting equipment

A sinkbox is a specialized hunting blind used by waterfowl hunters and consisting of a weighted, partially submerged enclosure large enough to hold one or more hunters and suspended from a floating platform. It is placed into calm water in locations where the chosen game bird is likely to appear, and the hunter waits, with the waterline at approximately shoulder height, until the birds are close to the sinkbox.
Sinkboxes were typically used by market (rather than sport) hunters for duck or other waterfowl in both the United States and Canada until 1918, when the practice was banned in the United States with the passage of the Migratory Bird Act of 1918.  Cast-iron sinkbox decoys — often painted — were used as ballast, to disguise the sinkbox, and to attract game close to the hunters. Sinkbox hunting, though still practiced in Canada, is largely a relic of the past, and the cast-iron decoys are popular among antique collectors.

CATEGORIES: History of Inner Mongolia, Neolithic cultures of China, History of Liaoning

The Xinglongwa culture (興隆洼文化) (6200-5400 BC) was a Neolithic culture in northeastern China, found mainly around the Inner Mongolia-Liaoning border. Xinglongwa pottery was primarily cylindrical, and baked at low temperatures.
The Xinglongwa culture showed several signs of communal planning. At three Xinglongwa sites, houses were built in rows. Several Xinglongwa sites also featured a large central building. In addition, several Xinglongwa sites were surrounded by ditches.   
The type site at Xinglongwa is located on the southwest side of a hill at Aohan Banner, Chifeng, Inner Mongolia; the site is named after a village 1.3 km to the southeast of the site. 120 pit-houses were discovered at Xinglongwa. Each home had a hearth at its center. Xinglongwa also featured a large building in the center of the village. Xinglongwa is the earliest discovered site in China to be surrounded by a ditch. Xinglongwa also featured an unusual burial custom, as some bodies were buried directly under the houses. Like other Xinglongwa sites, jade objects were also discovered. In the most lavish grave, a man was buried with a pair of pigs, as well as jade objects.
The recently discovered site at Xinglonggou is the only site of the culture to show evidence of any sort of agriculture, with evidence of millet remains.

[[Data governance]]

CATEGORIES: Information technology governance, Data management

Data governance is an emerging discipline with an evolving definition. The discipline embodies a convergence of data quality, data management, data policies, business process management, and risk management surrounding the handling of data in an organization. Through data governance, organizations are looking to exercise positive control over the processes and methods used by their data stewards and data custodians to handle data.
Data governance is a set of processes that ensures that important data assets are formally managed throughout the enterprise. Data governance ensures that data can be trusted and that people can be made accountable for any adverse event that happens because of low data quality. It is about putting people in charge of fixing and preventing issues with data so that the enterprise can become more efficient. Data governance also describes an evolutionary process for a company, altering the company’s way of thinking and setting up the processes to handle information so that it may be utilized by the entire organization. It’s about using technology when necessary in many forms to help aid the process. When companies desire, or are required, to gain control of their data, they empower their people, set up processes and get help from technology to do it.Sarsfield, Steve (2009). "The Data Governance Imperative", IT Governance.
There are some commonly cited vendor definitions for data governance. Data governance is a quality control discipline for assessing, managing, using, improving, monitoring, maintaining, and protecting organizational information. It is a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods.:[tpl]cite web|url=http://datagovernance.com/dgi_framework.pdf|title=Data Governance Institute Data Governance Framework[/tpl]

The yellowtail snapper, Ocyurus chrysurus, is an abundant species of snapper native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.  Although they have been found as far north as Massachusetts, their normal range is along Florida south to the West Indies and Brazil.  This species is mostly found around coral reefs, but may be found in other habitats.  They occur at depths of from near the surface to [tpl]convert|180|m|ft[/tpl], though mostly between [tpl]convert|10|and|70|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].  This species can reach a length of [tpl]convert|86.3|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], though most do not exceed [tpl]convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].  The greatest weight recorded for this species is [tpl]convert|4.1|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].  It is a commercially important species and has been farmed.  It is sought as a game fish by recreational anglers and is a popular species for display in public aquaria.  This species is the only known member of its genus.[tpl]FishBase species |genus= Ocyurus|species= chrysurus| month = December | year = 2013[/tpl]
In certain reefs, most notably in the Florida Keys, this beautifully colored fish is commonly spotted among divers and snorkelers. Yellowtails feed on shrimp, crabs, worms, and smaller fish. They spawn in groups off the edges of reefs from spring to fall, but heavily in midsummer.
Yellowtail snapper are typically caught in 30–120 ft of water on and around reefs and other structure.  The most common method of catching them is with hook and line, and the use of frozen chum, typically leftover ground fish parts, to attract the fish.  The chum is placed into a mesh bag or metal basket in the water, and as the chum slowly melts, small pieces of fish drift out and down towards the bottom, where the yellowtails typically feed.  The chum keeps them near the boat for extended periods of time, as well.
Light tackle is the generally accepted means of catching yellowtail snapper.  Typically, the fish are relatively wary of higher-test or thicker line, and larger hooks.  Most fish caught by anglers range from eight  to 14 in, although catches to 16 in are not uncommon.   Yellowtail snapper can be caught on a variety of baits, including both live and frozen shrimp, squid, and a variety of live and frozen minnows or smaller baitfish.  Yellowtail tend to be wary fish, and the appearance of larger predators, such as dolphins or sharks, can scare off schools until the predator leaves the area.
Most anglers pursue yellowtail snapper during the warmer months, but they can be caught throughout the year.  Yellowtail snapper is highly prized for its light, flaky meat and is considered by some to be one of the best of the snapper family.

[[Coke Escovedo]]
CATEGORIES: 1941 births, 1986 deaths, American percussionists, Musicians from Los Angeles, California, Musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area, American musicians of Mexican descent, Santana (band) members

Coke Escovedo (born Joseph Thomas Escovedo, April 30, 1941, in Los Angeles, California) was an American percussionist. Coke grew up in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area and developed an early interest in jazz and Latin music through exposure gained from his father, an aspiring big band singer, and eventually gravitated to drums and Latin percussion. Coke's older brother, fellow percussionist Pete Escovedo, recruited Coke for a local Latin jazz combo led by pianist Carlos Federico. The Federico combo evolved into the Escovedo Brothers Band, which also counted Pete, bassist brother, Phil Escovedo, saxophonist-flautist Mel Martin and trombonist Al Bent among its regular members. Coke began to gain some notoriety in the San Francisco Bay Area Latin jazz scene and worked with jazz vibraphonist Cal Tjader (some of his finest work can be found on Tjader's album Agua Dulce). Coke rose to even greater prominence in early 1971 when he first became a member of Santana, initially as a replacement for timbale player Jose "Chepito" Areas, who had been sidelined with medical issues. Escovedo was featured on Santana's Santana III album. Coke co-authored a hit song from that album, "No One To Depend On", which peaked at #36 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Years later the song would be covered by Vitamin C as part of her 1999 hit "Me, Myself And I" (#36 on Top 40 Mainstream chart). While in the Santana band, Coke performed at many high-profile concerts, including the historic closing of the Fillmore West (appearing on the live recording and documentary film from that event). Santana drummer Michael Shrieve has credited Coke for showing him how to incorporate some Latin percussion figures into his drum set playing during their time together.[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] During Carlos Santana's transition period between the original and "New" Santana bands, Coke also performed with the Carlos Santana/Buddy Miles group, appearing on the 1972 release Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles! Live!
Coke had been, along with Jose "Chepito" Areas, pioneering a new style on the traditional Cuban timbales. Though drawing on the influence of the extroverted timbale showman Tito Puente, Coke took the explosive power of the Cuban drums even farther, adding spice to rock and soul music recordings by artists such as Boz Scaggs, Cold Blood, It's A Beautiful Day, and Malo (with whom he was a featured soloist on their debut LP), as well as to freer jazz experiments with artists such as trumpeter Luis Gasca. In early 1972 Coke, following his vision of putting together "a band that could play anything", formed Azteca along with his brother Pete Escovedo. The band signed to Columbia Records and released its self-titled debut album in December 1972. It reached No. 38 on the R&B chart in 1973. A second album, Pyramid of the Moon, was released in the fall of 1973. Both albums prominently featured Coke's timbale playing and some of his compositions, as leader of an all-star cast of musicians, many of whom would become prominent solo artists. Despite garnering critical acclaim and playing high-profile concert tours,[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] the big-band Azteca lineup was difficult to sustain. Second release Pyramid of the Moon failed to chart and by 1974, Coke Escovedo left Azteca. In 1975 he began work on the first of his three solo albums, simply titled Coke. This 1976 solo debut featured a spare, sophisticated soul/funk/jazz/Latin blend highlighting the talents of vocalist Linda Tillery (formerly of  The Loading Zone) and keyboardist-composer Herman Eberitzsch. A Top 100 R&B single, "Make It Sweet", resulted, along with a TV appearance on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert.  Coke recorded two more albums: the pop-oriented Comin' at Ya! (featuring former Azteca vocalist Errol Knowles) in 1976. 1977's Disco Fantasy proved critically and commercially disappointing and became the last album of solo material he released. Escovedo continued to perform in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond at the helm of a band that included former Malo guitarist Abel Zarate in pursuit of a new record deal which never materialized, and also continued to do session work and to tour with the likes of Santana, Herbie Hancock and his niece Sheila E, finally relocating to the Los Angeles area in the 1980s. Coke Escovedo died at the age of 45 on July 13, 1986.

The two villages have a combined population of 444 according to the 2001 New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings and are located between Darfield and Springfield on State Highway 73 and the Midland Line railway.  The towns were settled in the 19th century by farmers attracted to the area for sheep grazing.
Sheffield has a railway station and was once a railway junction.  The first railway line reached the town in the late 1870s from a junction in Darfield with the Whitecliffs Branch.  This line, then known as the Malvern Branch line, grew to become the Midland Line between Christchurch and the West Coast.  On 28 July 1884, the Oxford Branch was extended over the Waimakariri River to Sheffield, making the town a railway junction.  Plans existed to continue this extension south from Sheffield as part of the proposed Canterbury Interior Main Line, but this never came to fruition and the rail link with Oxford closed on 14 July 1930.

The beta hairpin (sometimes also called beta-ribbon or beta-beta unit) is a simple protein structural motif involving two beta strands that look like a hairpin. The motif consists of two strands that are adjacent in primary structure, oriented in an antiparallel direction (the N-terminus of one sheet is adjacent to the C-terminus of the next), and linked by a short loop of two to five amino acids. Beta hairpins can occur in isolation or as part of a series of hydrogen bonded strands that collectively comprise a beta sheet.
Researchers such as Francisco Blanco et al. have used protein NMR to show that beta-hairpins can be formed from isolated short peptides in aqueous solution, suggesting that hairpins could form nucleation sites for protein folding.[tpl]cite journal |last=Blanco |first=F.

Ilus Winfield Davis (April 22, 1917 – September 4, 1996) was mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, United States from 1963 to 1971.
"Ike" Davis grew up on the east side of Kansas City and in 1933 was in the freshman class of the University of Kansas City which was to become the University of Missouri-Kansas City.  He was instrumental in founding the student newspaper the University News. He was to get a law degree from the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri and served in the Army during World War II.
Davis was elected Kansas City mayor by 1,810 votes in nearly 110,000 cast in 1963. He oversaw the bond issue to build Kansas City International Airport and pushed for construction of the Truman Sports Complex for the Kansas City Chiefs and eventually the Kansas City Royals.  He dealt with labor strife during the construction of the two projects and the 1968 Kansas City riot following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King.  In April 1968 following the King assassination Davis met with a large group of inner city school students on the steps of City Hall.  A police officer fired tear gas canister into the crowd and a riot erupted in which six were to die.

[[Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889]]

The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 (previously called the Great Fire of 1889) was a wildfire in California which burned large parts of Orange County and San Diego County during the last week of September, 1889.
Assistant Regional Forester (USFS), L.A. Barrett, who wrote a 1935 report on California wildfires, said of it: "I was living in Orange County at the time and well remember the great fire reported herein from September 24 to 26. Nothing like it occurred in California since the National Forests have been administered. In fact in my 33 years in the Service I have never seen a forest or brush fire to equal it. This one covered an enormous scope of country and burned very rapidly."[tpl]Primary source-inline|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Conditions leading up to this 1889 fire event included a much longer and more severe annual drought than usual, with rains largely ceasing in March and less than 1 cm of precipitation being recorded for the 5½ months prior (records from the National Archives). This was coupled with multiple katabatic wind events (known as “northers” or Santa Anas) that month, one of which occurred about 10 days prior and likely added to the dryness of fuels. Temperatures during the week prior remained high and were coupled with several severe fires in San Diego County in which “at least [tpl]convert|10000|acre|km2[/tpl] have burned over, a dwelling house consumed and other property destroyed”

[[Optical add-drop multiplexer]]

CATEGORIES: Fiber-optic communications, Multiplexing

An optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM) is a device used in wavelength-division multiplexing systems for multiplexing and routing different channels of light into or out of a single mode fiber (SMF). This is a type of optical node, which is generally used for the construction of optical telecommunications networks. "Add" and "drop" here refer to the capability of the device to add one or more new wavelength channels to an existing multi-wavelength WDM signal, and/or to drop (remove) one or more channels, passing those signals to another network path. An OADM may be considered to be a specific type of optical cross-connect.
A traditional OADM consists of three stages: an optical demultiplexer, an optical multiplexer, and between them a method of reconfiguring the paths between the optical demultiplexer, the  optical multiplexer and a set of ports for adding and dropping signals. The optical demultiplexer separates wavelengths in an input fiber onto ports. The reconfiguration can be achieved by a fiber patch panel or by optical switches which direct the wavelengths to the optical multiplexer or to drop ports. The optical multiplexer multiplexes the wavelength channels that are to continue on from demultipexer ports with those from the add ports, onto a single output fiber. 
All the light paths that directly pass an OADM are termed cut-through lightpaths, while those that are added or dropped at the OADM node are termed added/dropped lightpaths. An OADM with remotely reconfigurable optical switches (for example 1×2) in the middle stage is called a reconfigurable OADM (ROADM). Ones without this feature are known as fixed OADMs. While the term OADM applies to both types, it is often used interchangeably with ROADM.
Physically, there are several ways to realize an OADM. There are a variety of demultiplexer and multiplexer technologies including thin film filters, fiber Bragg gratings with optical circulators, free space grating devices and integrated planar arrayed waveguide gratings. The switching or reconfiguration functions range from the manual fiber patch panel to a variety of switching technologies including microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), liquid crystal and thermo-optic switches in planar waveguide circuits.
Although both have add/drop functionality, OADMs are distinct from add-drop multiplexers. The former function in the photonic domain under wavelength-division multiplexing, while the latter are implicitly considered to function in the traditional SONET/SDH networks.

Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones (1848–1922) was an English educator and writer on logic and ethics, and Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge, from 1903 until 1916. Her ideas were misrepresented by Bertrand Russell as his own.
She was educated at Girton, taking a first class in the Moral Sciences Tripos in 1880; was a resident lecturer on moral sciences (1884–1903), and after 1903 mistress.  She translated, with Miss Hamilton, Hermann Lotze's Mikrokosmus (1888); edited Henry Sidgwick's Methods of Ethics (1901) and his Ethics of Green, Spencer, and Martineau (1902); and wrote Elements of Logic (1890); A Primer of Logic (1905); A Primer of Ethics (1909); A New Law of Thought and its Logical Bearing (1911); Girton College (1913). 
Jones was the first woman recorded as having delivered a paper to the Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club. She spoke about James Ward's Naturalism and Agnosticism on 1 December 1899, with the philosopher Henry Sidgwick chairing the meeting.Pitt, Jack.

[[Lake Lyndon]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of the Canterbury Region

Lake Lyndon is a small lake in the Canterbury region of New Zealand's South Island.  It is located near Porters Pass on State Highway 73 after Springfield heading into the Southern Alps. The lake regularly freezes in winter due to its elevation and location on the outer border of the Southern Alps. Native plants present in the lake include, Isoetes, native Pondweeds, native Milfoils, Charophyte species, and Charophyte meadow. Invasive plants present in the lake are currently on the Elodea species. The current lake submerged plant indicator (SPI) condition is rated as high, as of April 2010, and measured by NIWA.Lake Lyndon NIWA LakeSPI Report Card - April 2010. http://lakespi.niwa.co.nz/lake/48597
It is roughly an hour from Christchurch and is a popular site for rainbow trout fishing as the trout population in the lake is thriving due to the dense oxygen weed beds that provide a plentiful food source.  The lake is largely surrounded by Korowai/Torlesse Tussocklands Park,Korowai/Torlesse Tussocklands Park, Department of Conservation. http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/canterbury/north-canterbury-and-arthurs-pass/korowai-torlesse-tussocklands-park/ and the Acheron River flows from the lake to the Rakaia River.  Mount Lyndon is to the west of the lake and Castle Hill Peak is to the North of the lake.
One of the proposed routes for the Midland Line railway to Westland would have left the now-closed Whitecliffs Branch in Homebush and followed the eastern shore of Lake Lyndon on its route to Cass.  The route that was built takes a more direct route to Cass and bypasses the lake.

A Schützenfest (German "marksmen's festival") is a traditional festival or fair featuring a target shooting competition in the cultures of both Germany and Switzerland.
At a Schützenfest, contestants compete based on their shooting abilities, for example by shooting at a wooden representation of an eagle. The winner of the competition becomes the 'Schützenkönig' ("king of marksmen") until the next year's competition.
The commercially organized Schützenfest of Hanover, Germany, is the largest marksmen's Fun Fair in the world with more than 5,000 marksmen, 250 rides and inns, 5 large beer tents and the "Marksmen's Parade". The parade with more than 10,000 participants from Germany and all over the world and more than 100 bands is 12 kilometres long. It is the longest parade in the world. The landmark of the funfair is the highest transportable Ferris wheel in the world. It is 60 metres high and can transport 420 people in 42 cabins.

}}
"No Me Queda Más" ([tpl]lang-en|"There's Nothing Left for Me"[/tpl]) is a song recorded by American Tejano pop recording artist Selena from her fifth studio album Amor Prohibido (1994). It was released by EMI Latin on 10 November 1994, as the album's third single. "No Me Queda Más" was composed by lead keyboardist of Selena y Los Dinos, Ricky Vela; who had fallen in love with Selena's sister and drummer of the group, Suzette Quintanilla. Selena's brother and producer of her music, A.B. Quintanilla III produced "No Me Queda Más" alongside Argentine arranger and composer Bebu Silvetti.
"No Me Queda Más" is a Spanish-language down-tempo ballad with influences of flamenco and ranchera music. The central theme and lyrical content of the song conveys the story of a bewildered fiancée whose ex-lover has left her for another women and keeps an illusion that he will one day go back with her; while her ex-lover denies even loving her, she wishes him happiness. "No Me Queda Más" peaked at number one on the US Hot Latin Tracks for seven non-consecutive weeks and the Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts, giving Selena her third consecutive number one single from Amor Prohibido. "No Me Queda Más" became the number-one song on the Billboard Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart for 1995. It also peaked at number 13 on the Latin Pop Airplay chart. 
"No Me Queda Más" was praised by contemporary music critics, who highly praised Selena's emotive vocalization she used to record the song. "No Me Queda Más" was nominated for "Song of the Year" at the 1994 Broadcast Music Latin Awards.  With "No Me Queda Más" and thirteen other of Selena's top-ten singles in the Hot Latin Tracks chart she was named "top Latin artist of the '90s" and "Best selling Latin artist of the decade" by Billboard. "Amor Prohibido" and "No Me Queda Más", became the most successful singles of 1994 and 1995, according to Billboard. There has been a number of covers by various artists ranging from Mexican to Dominican American musicians.
The song's accompanying music video was directed by Sean Roberts and features Selena in various locations in Texas, in some scenes Selena is reminiscing of her ex-lover while in others she is distraught and crying. The video was highly anticipated by EMI Latin to have been the "next big move" for Selena, as the label believed the video would be immensely popular in South American countries. It won "Video of the Year" at the 1995 Billboard Latin Music Awards and received favorable criticism from music critics.

It is near Lake Lyndon and is located within Korowai/Torlesse Tussocklands Park.  State Highway 73 travels through the pass on its route from Springfield to Cass, and it is the last mountain pass on the route eastwards from Westland to Christchurch. It is also the third-highest point on the South Island's state highway network after the Lindis Pass and the Milford Road (though it is just one metre lower). Although Arthur's Pass is better known, Porters Pass is actually a few metres higher, and it affords views of the Canterbury Plains.
The pass was named in 1858 by the Porter brothers who were farming nearby.[tpl]cite web|last=Wilson|first=John|title=Canterbury places - Porters Pass to Arthur’s Pass|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-places/14|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=2 March 2009[/tpl]

"Fotos y recuerdos" ([tpl]lang-en|Pictures and Memories[/tpl]) is a song recorded by American recording artist Selena for her fifth studio album Amor prohibido (1994). It was released by EMI Latin on 14 February 1995, as the album's fourth single. Inspired by the Pretenders' 1982 song "Back on the Chain Gang", Selena's brother and music producer A.B. Quintanilla III asked Ricky Vela, the lead keyboardist of Selena y Los Dinos, to transform the song into a Spanish-language cumbia. Argentine arranger and composer Bebu Silvetti, produced "Fotos y recuerdos" alongside Quintanilla III. Recording sessions for "Fotos y recuerdos" was delayed because Selena and the band did not get a license to record the song, which stirred a controversy.
"Fotos y recuerdos" is a Spanish-language mid-tempo cumbia that contains influences of house and dance-pop. The central theme and lyrical content of the song is about a lonely women who, kisses the pictures of her beloved boyfriend every night before she goes to sleep, while reminiscing memories she keeps intact. "Fotos y recuerdos" peaked at number one on the US Hot Latin Tracks for seven consecutive weeks, giving Selena her fourth number one single from Amor prohibido. Selena became the first Hispanic singer to have an album produce four number one songs. It also peaked at number 34 on the Hot Singles Sales, number two on the Billboard Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart, and number one on the Latin 40 chart.
"Fotos y recuerdos" was praised by contemporary music critics, who believed that the song is an "improvement" and/or a "better" version of the Pretenders' original recording, while many agreed that "Fotos y recuerdos" is one of Selena's most "famous songs". With "Fotos y recuerdos" and thirteen other of Selena's top-ten singles in the Hot Latin Songs chart, she was named "top Latin artist of the 1990s" and "Best selling Latin artist of the decade" by Billboard magazine. There has been a number of covers that were done as a tribute to Selena after she was murdered.

The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) is the ninth spy film in the James Bond series and the second to star Roger Moore as the  fictional  MI6 agent James Bond. A loose adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel of same name, the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a device that can harness the power of the sun, while facing the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, the "Man with the Golden Gun". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.
The Man with the Golden Gun was the fourth and final film in the series directed by Guy Hamilton. The script was written by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz. The film was set in the face of the 1973 energy crisis, a dominant theme in the script—Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then-popular martial arts film craze, with several kung-fu scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being shot in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Macau.
The film saw mixed reviews, with Christopher Lee's performance as Scaramanga, intended to be a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond, being praised; but reviewers criticised the film as a whole, particularly the comedic approach, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon. Although the film was profitable, it is the fourth-lowest-grossing Bond film in the series. It was also the final film to be co-produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in Danjaq, LLC, the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.

CATEGORIES: Vehicle parts

An Ignition (or starter) switch is a switch in the control system of an internal combustion engined motor vehicle that activates the main electrical systems for the vehicle.  Besides providing power to the starter solenoid and the ignition system components (including the engine control unit and ignition coil) it also usually switches on power to many "accessories" (radio, power windows, etc.). The ignition switch usually requires a key be inserted that works a lock built into the switch mechanism. It is frequently combined with the starter switch which activates the starter motor. The ignition locking system may be bypassed by disconnecting the wiring to the switch and manipulating it directly; this is known as hotwiring.

CATEGORIES: Deaths by person, Eastern Orthodox liturgical days, Christian festivals and holy days, Gospel episodes, John the Baptist, Individual human heads, skulls and brains

The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (also known as: Decollation of Saint John the Baptist or Beheading of the Forerunner) is a holy day observed by various Christian churches that follow liturgical traditions. The day commemorates the martyrdom by beheading of Saint John the Baptist on the orders of Herod Antipas through the vengeful request of his step-daughter Salome and her mother.
On August 29, 2012, during a televised public audience at the summer palace of Castel Gandolfo, Pope Benedict XVI maintained the discovery of Saint John the Baptist's fragmented head for the second time attested to the historical veneration of his sanctity dating back to the Apostolic Age. In addition, the Pontiff also noted that the religious feast particularly commemorates the transfer of this relic, now enshrined in the Basilica of San Silvestro in Capite in Rome.

CATEGORIES: Selwyn District, Populated places in New Zealand

Whitecliffs is a small town with a population of 117 in the Selwyn District of the Canterbury region of New Zealand's South Island.  It has also been known as South Malvern (Sheffield was formerly known as Malvern), and the name of Whitecliffs comes from terrace cliffs above the Selwyn River.  The town was once significantly larger and home to industrial activity such as pottery and brick-making, and coal and sand mining took place nearby.  The town's economic importance was significant enough for the Whitecliffs Branch, a branch line railway from the Midland Line, to be built to the town.  It opened on 3 November 1875.  Passenger services ceased on 13 March 1949, and due to declining freight, the line was closed entirely on 31 March 1962.  The railway's engine shed still stands in the town.

Pietro di Giacomo Cataneo (c. 1510 in Siena-c. 1574) was a 16th-century Italian architect.
He is principally remembered for his I Quattro Primi Libri di Architettura (1554), a set of four books on architectural theory. In order, the books cover the design of fortified cities, materials, ecclesiastical architecture and domestic architecture. His work on the design of cities was influential, having been cited by Andrea PalladioCenter for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., Palladio's Literary Predecessors and elaborated on by Scamozzi and Vasari. His plan for an 'ideal city' is said to have influenced Richard Newcourt's proposal for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire, as well as the design of cities such as Philadelphia and Savannah.Neil E. Hoyt, Re-Humanizing the Commercial Core: A Masterplan for Chicago's Central Loop (Master's thesis: University of Notre Dame, 2005) The plan also bears a strong resemblance to the CBD of Adelaide.

Chris  Drury (born 1948, Colombo, Sri Lanka) is a British environmental artist.   His body of work includes ephemeral assemblies of natural materials, in the mode associated with Andy Goldsworthy, as well as more-permanent landscape art, works on paper, and indoor installations. He also works on 3D sculptures (three-dimensional).
Some of Drury's lasting works are "cloud chambers", darkened caverns constructed of local rock, turf, or other materials.   Each chamber has a hole in the roof which serves as a pinhole camera; viewers may enter the chamber and observe the image of the sky and clouds projected onto the walls and floor.  On paper, he uses a variety of unusual media---notably mushroom spore prints, dung, and peat---as a source of color and patterns, which he might overlay with text or fingerprints, or underlay with maps or other geographic images.   More recently, Drury has produced works associated with the body, working in residence with hospitals and incorporating echocardiogram data and blood into his art. His latest creation is the strange live sculpture called

[[Self-report inventory]]
CATEGORIES: Personality tests

A self-report inventory is a type of psychological test in which a person fills out a survey or questionnaire with or without the help of an investigator. Self-report inventories often ask direct questions about symptoms, behaviors, and personality traits associated with one or many mental disorders or personality types in order to easily gain insight into a patient's personality or illness. Most self-report inventories can be taken or administered within five to 15 minutes, although some, like the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), can take up to three hours to fully complete.  There are three major approaches to developing self-report inventories: theory-guided, factor analysis, and criterion-key.  Theory-guided inventories are constructed around a theory of personality.  Criterion-keyed inventories are based around questions that have been shown to statistically discriminate between a control group and a criterion group.  Questionnaires typically use one of three formats: a Likert scale, true-false, or forced choice.  True-false involves questions that the individual denotes as either being true or false about themselves.  Forced-choice is a pair of statements that require the individual to choose one as being most representative of themselves.
Self-report inventories can have validity problems. Patients may exaggerate symptoms in order to make their situation seem worse, or they may under-report the severity or frequency of symptoms in order to minimize their problems.  Another issue is the social desirability bias.

The Cordillera del Cóndor (Condor mountain range) is a mountain range in the eastern Andes that is shared by and part of the international border between Ecuador and Peru.
The range extends approximately 150 km north to south and its maximum elevation reaches approximately 2,900m. The Río Santiago and Cenepa River flow along its eastern slopes on the Peruvian side. For over 160 years, the area of the border was in dispute, and sparked armed conflicts between the two countries in 1941, 1981 and 1995. After the border conflict of 1995, the two countries began diplomatic negotiations, resulting in the 1998 peace treaty that established the exact location of the international border.
The Cordillera del Condor is an area of great interest to biology, possibly having the richest flora in any area of the same size and the South American continent, and is considered by Conservation International to be one of the most important biodiversity areas on the planet. The cordillera has one of the highest concentrations of vascular plant species yet unknown to science. The area is part of the ecoregion of the Eastern Cordillera real montane forests.

CATEGORIES: 1931 births, 1980 deaths, Assassinated Bolivian politicians, Bolivian socialists, People killed in Operation Condor, People from Cochabamba, People murdered in Bolivia, Government ministers of Bolivia

Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz (1931–1980) was a noted writer, dramatist, jourmalist, social commentator, university professor, and socialist political leader from Bolivia. In 1964 Marcelo won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for his novel Los Deshabitados.
As a congressman of the Falange Socialista Boliviana, he was jailed by the regime of General René Barrientos (1964–69) for his loud denunciation of the "San Juan Massacre," in which dozens of dissenting miners were murdered by the Military of Bolivia in the Siglo XX mines at St John's Eve 1967. In 1969, he was appointed Minister of Mining and Energy by de facto President Alfredo Ovando Candía, who purported to be a populist dedicated to bringing major structural reforms. Quiroga recommended, and then carried out, the controversial nationalization of the Bolivian concerns of the U.S.-based Gulf Oil Company. This turned him into a national celebrity of sorts. Forced out of the Ovando government by conservative officers who consider him an enemy of the military institution, Quiroga went on to form, in 1971, the Partido Socialista. His portion of the party then came to be known as the Partido Socialista-1 following a split while in exile during the long years of the Hugo Banzer dictatorship (1971–78).
Upon returning to Bolivia in 1977, Quiroga participated in the presidential elections of 1978, 1979 (inconclusive) and 1980. He did particularly well in the 1980 contest, when he finished fourth with double the number of votes he had received in 1979. He was clearly on the rise, and, in fact, had become the most visible and popular spokesman for the Socialist left. From his congressional seat, he led the effort to bring to trial the former dictator Hugo Banzer, on charges of massive human rights violations and economic mismanagement. This may have cost him his life, for Quiroga was brutally abducted and subsequently assassinated during the early hours of the July 17, 1980, during the coup led by General Luis Garcia Meza. Many witnessed, at the headquarters of the Central Obrera Boliviana, his wounding and abduction by security forces. He had been participating in a high-level meeting to discuss ways to resist the coup. His body has never been found, nor those who killed him. His wife and sons are still searching for his body.
A gifted orator and uncompromising idealist, Quiroga is revered in Bolivia as one of the martyrs of the anti-authoritarian and pro-democratic struggles of the 1970s.

[[Sulfation]]

CATEGORIES: Proteins, Posttranslational modification

Sulfation in biochemistry is the enzyme-catalyzed addition of sulfate to another molecule. It often refers to a phase II enzyme reaction. This biotransformation process uses its cosubstrate 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to transfer sulfate to a xenobiotic. Most of the time this is effective in rendering the xenobiotic less active from a pharmacological and toxicological standpoint, but sometimes it plays a role in the activation of xenobiotics (e.g. aromatic amines, methyl substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).
Another example of a biological sulfation reaction is in the creation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Here, the sulfate group is being added either via oxygen (O-sulfation) or nitrogen (N-sulfation).

The name Deception Bay is often abbreviated to D-Bay. This term, D-Bay was mainly used by outsiders, organisations or recent arrivals to The Bay. The suburb was previously plagued with crime and high unemployment during the 1980s and 1990s as it was populated with one of the most concentrated social housing in Queensland by the government of the day; however community problems subsided after 2001 due to development and population growth in the area.D-Bay wants a name change | The Courier-Mail

[[Agustín Morales]]

Pedro Agustín Morales Hernández (March 11, 1808 – November 27, 1872) was a military officer and de facto President of Bolivia between 1871 and 1872.
Morales was born in La Paz.  Originally a supporter of President José Ballivián (1841–47), Morales became a sworn enemy of General Manuel Belzu, who had in essence overthrown Ballivián in 1847. Following many years combatting Belzu, Morales came to power with President José Maria Linares (1857–1861). Opposed to the government of General José Maria de Achá, who had overthrown Linares, Morales supported the 1864 coup that brought to power the notorious General Mariano Melgarejo, who rewarded him with the generalship and (importantly) command of the Bolivian Army. Melgarejo's "Sexenio" (Six-Year Ordeal) had been constroversial and brutal, and opposition to it became widespread. Eventually, General Morales changed sides and, after uniting all the factions fighting against the President, dethroned Melgarejo via coup d'état in January, 1871. Thus ended the dreaded "Sexenio"—but not the era of military rule.
Of legendarily volcanic temperament, Morales endeavored to rule as a dictator, but was exposed as semi-literate when, in 1872, one of his letters was published in the newspapers by a famous Bolivian writer. Embarrassed, Morales called Congress for the first time since the early Achá administration and declared himself ready to leave office if considered unworthy. While Congress deliberated, Morales suffered from extremely violent tantrums and mood changes. This led him to physically assault one of his military aides in the Government Palace at La Paz on November 27, 1872. The President's nephew, Federico Lafaye, tried to stop him but was struck himself, whereupon Lafaye shot and killed the temperamental President.
Following Morales' death, Congress proclaimed Tomás Frías as temporary President, charged with the task of calling elections in 1873.

[[Blagoveshchensky Bridge]]

CATEGORIES: Bridges in Saint Petersburg, Bridges completed in 1850

The Blagoveshchensky (Annunciation) Bridge ([tpl]lang|ru|Благовещенский мост[/tpl]; from 1855 to 1918 Nikolaevsky Bridge, [tpl]lang|ru|Николаевский мост[/tpl]; from 1918 to 2007 called Lieutenant Schmidt Bridge, [tpl]lang|ru|Мост Лейтенанта Шмидта[/tpl]) is the first permanent bridge built across the Neva River in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It connects Vasilievsky Island and the central part of the city (Admiralteysky raion). The bridge's length is 331 meters and the width was 24 meters. The original name of the bridge was Nevsky Bridge. It was later renamed Blagoveshchensky Bridge. After the death of Tsar Nicholas I, it was named Nikolaevsky Bridge in his honor, and in 1918 it was renamed for Lieutenant Schmidt.
In 1727 a temporary bridge was built at the location of the modern bridge. The place was chosen by Menshikov whose palace is located at the opposite bank. This bridge, named Issakievsky, existed until the current bridge was built, at which time it was moved to the location of where Palace Bridge is located today.
The bridge was built in 1843-1850. It was designed by Stanisław Kierbedź, a Polish engineer working in Russia. The architect Alexander Brullov participated in the decoration. The design was a cast iron bridge with a bascule section. At the time, it was the longest bridge in Europe. According to the legend, the Russian Tsar, Nicholas I promised to Kierbedź to give him a promotion for every completed span. After the bridge was completed with eight spans total in it, Kierbedź was promoted to the rank of General, but actually when he started the construction he already had a rank of Podpolkovnik (i.e. lieutenant colonel).
The bridge was formally opened on November 12, 1850. Since it was close to Blagoveshchenskaya (Annunciation) Square, it was called Blagoveshchensky Bridge. In 1855 it was renamed Nikolayevsky Bridge in memory of Emperor Nicholas I. In 1918, after the revolution, it was renamed again, this time in memory of Pyotr Schmidt, a leader of the Sevastopol Uprising during the Russian Revolution of 1905.
In 2006 a reconstruction of the bridge began. Since it would be completely closed to traffic for over a year, a temporary bridge was constructed between September 2005 and May 2006. During the reconstruction all traffic, both pedestrian and motorized, moved across the temporary bridge. In May 2006 the Lieutenant Schmidt Bridge was closed to traffic, and the dismantling of the spans, and then, of bridge supports began. The reconstruction was completed on August 15, 2007, slightly over two years after work began. During reconstruction the deck was widened from 24 m to 37 m.
After reconstruction, the bridge was renamed Blagoveshchensky Bridge.

Dexter Gilman Wansel (born August 22, 1950) is an American keyboardist, raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He contributed to the development of the Philly Sound and worked with producers Gamble and Huff at Philadelphia International Records. Wansel led the musical group, Yellow Sunshine.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p21317/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography: Dexter Wansel|last=Hogan|first=Ed|publisher=AMG|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] He has worked with Phyllis Hyman, The Jacksons, MFSB, Teddy Pendergrass, Patti Labelle, The Jones Girls, Evelyn "Champagne" King, Grover Washington Jr. and Lou Rawls, amongs many others. He also wrote The Jones Girls 1981 soul music song "Nights over Egypt" and Patti Labelle's 1983 #1 R&B hit, "If Only You Knew", with Cynthia Biggs. His "Theme from the Planets" has been sampled and was featured on the breakbeat compilation album, Ultimate Breaks and Beats.
Whilst Wansel was relatively unknown outside the U.S., many have suggested[tpl]Who|date=January 2009[/tpl] that his influence on pop music, as both a producer and performer in the mid-1970s, led to the development of new age soul and jazz funk. His most successful album was Life On Mars, released on the Philadelphia International record label in 1976. Wansel played keyboards, Derek Graves played bass guitar whilst a session singer, Terri Wells, was on vocals. The remaining sound was filled in by Dexter's rhythm section called The Planets featuring Darryl Brown, Calvin Harris, Bobby Malach, Al Harrison and the aforementioned Graves.
During the second half of the 1970s, space travel and sci-fi were important themes in the ambient U.S. culture and therefore in funk, jazz, and jazz funk, and were reflected in Dexter's titles and music.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Listening to other tracks on the album, like "Stargazer", "Theme from the Planets" and "Rings of Saturn", it can be seen that a space theme runs through his music.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] His "Funk Attack" on the 1979 album Time is Slipping Away  and "I'll Never Forget (My Favorite Disco)" have stood the test of time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Instrumental arrangements appeared on his album Voyager (1978).  In addition to this he presented a disco theme with "Disco Lights" from the album What The World is Coming To (1977); and jazz funk such as "Latin Love" on Voyager; or "Ode Infinitum" on What The World Is Coming To.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
Wansel has produced and recorded many soul ballads including the Time is Slipping Away title track, "New Beginning" on that same album, "The Sweetest Pain" (which was sampled by The Solid Doctor for his trip hop track "Lights On The Vibe", by DJ Cam for his track "Dieu Reconnaîtra Les Siens", and by Global Communication for their track "The Way")   and "You Can Be What You Wanna Be" from 1976. He also co-wrote and produced the Pieces of a Dream track, "Warm Weather". The track "Rings of saturn" was sampled by Dela for his track "Long Life" featuring Talib Kweli. Purists consider his "I'm In Love Once Again",  released on Philadelphia International Records by Jean Carn in 1976, to be his finest work, combining sublime chord sequences with a lavish production.

He is a PEN Honorary Member.[tpl]cite web | author = International PEN | title = Newsletter of the Writers in Prison Committee of International PEN | url = http://www.pensweden.org/images/PenewsSept03.pdf | accessdate = August 2, 2006 [/tpl] He has served 17 years in prison[tpl]cite web | author = Derya Sazak on Milliyet | title= İmralı'daki değil dışarıdakiler konuşsun (not the one in İmralı but others should speak) | url= http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2006/03/14/siyaset/asiy.html | accessdate = March 25, 2007 | language = Turkish[/tpl] on propaganda (trumped up) charges stemming from his writings about the Kurdish population in Turkey.
Beşikçi studied at the Faculty of Political Sciences of Ankara University, and graduated in 1962. After his military duty he became an assistant professor at Atatürk University in Erzurum. He prepared his first anthropological study, an investigation of one of the last nomadic Kurdish tribes, the Alikan, here, which he submitted in 1967 to the Ankara Faculty of Political Sciences. 
His second encounter with the Kurds was during his military service when he served in Bitlis and Hakkâri where he first saw the nomadic Alikan tribe pass through Bitlis on their migrations from winter to summer meadows and back.

His book "The order of East Anatolia", first published in 1969, in which he sought to adapt and apply Marxist concepts to the analysis of Kurdish society and to the processes of socio-economic and political change taking place, made him a public enemy. While the book did not cause much debate either in academic or left intellectual circles, the university took disciplinary measures against him which would lead to a trial after the 1971 coup. He was detained and put on trial for communist and anti-national propaganda where he was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for violating the indivisibility of the Turkish nation.
Beşikçi did not have to serve his full 13 years and benefited amnesty in late 1974. He unsuccessfully applied for a position at the Faculty of Political Sciences in Ankara, which in 1970 had appeared willing to employ him. He never found academic employment again and was henceforth to do his research as an independent scholar, in economically precarious circumstances. 
For many years, Ismail Beşikçi was the only non-Kurdish person in Turkey to speak out loud and clearly in defense of the rights of the Kurds. Continuing to write and speak in spite of all attempts to silence him, Beşikçi has become a powerful and important symbol for the Kurds and for the human rights movement of Turkey.He was charged for over 100 yearshttp://www.etext.org/Politics/Arm.The.Spirit/Kurdistan/Articles/ismail-besikci.txt but released from jail in 1999.Turkish writer released from jail (1999) In 1987 he was a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. 32 of the 36 books that he has published have been banned in Turkey.
He has been described as "modern Turkey's pioneer of Kurdish studies".

In 2010 he was again prosecuted, this time by the attorney general of Istanbul for “PKK propaganda” on account of an article on "The rights of the nations to self-determination and the Kurds" that he wrote for the "Association of Contemporary Lawyers".
 In March 2011 he was sentenced to 15 months in prison.

[[Zucca (aperitif)]]
CATEGORIES: Italian alcoholic beverages

Zucca is a commercial Italian aperitif.  Although its name is Zucca, the Italian word for squash, and is featured at Zucca's Bar located in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milano, its base ingredient is Rhubarb, hence its name Rabarbaro Zucca. It is also combined with zest, cardamom seeds and other curative herbs.  The liqueur has a delicate and pleasant bittersweet taste and is often mixed with soda water and ice. Zucca is closely related to other traditional Italian aperitifs, such as Campari, Punt e Mes, and Cynar, as its relatively light, with a 16% volume in alcohol.  
Zucca is owned by the same company that produces Amaretto Di Saronno. Despite this, it is difficult to find commercially in North America.  However it enjoys a certain amount of prominence as the featured drink at the Zucca bar in Galleria at the Piazza del Duomo in Milan, Italy.  The bar is also the site where Gaspare Campari first introduced his alcoholic infusion of herbs in the 1860s.

[[Sjoerd Koppert]]

CATEGORIES: 1950 births, Living people, Dutch record producers, Dutch audio engineers, People from The Hague, People from  Santa Barbara County, California, Date of birth missing (living people)

Sjoerd Auke Koppert, a.k.a. Sjoko (born 1950, The Hague) is a Dutch-born recording engineer and producer  who is now based in Carpinteria, California. He was the "sound guy" behind many successful Dutch bands in the early '70's, before going on to work with numerous high profile international artists. Since then, Sjoerd has built a solid background of expertise in the music industry, business development, and consultancy.
Sjoerd’s involvement in the music industry started in the mid 60’s, when Dutch bands like Golden Earring, Focus, Shocking Blue and various others broke through on the International scene. Recognized as one of the leading engineers in Europe at the time, he worked with many top acts, from The Who, Pink Floyd, ABBA, the Doors, Jefferson Airplane, the Beach Boys to Elton John, Rod Stewart, the Faces, The Rolling Stones, the Doobie Brothers, J. Geils, Frank Zappa, and many more. His sound design expertise also lead to the establishment of I.M.S. (International Music Services), which grew to become Europe’s leading Sound Corporation at the time, as well as the development of the first live surround-sound (quadraphonic) systems (Pink Floyd, Golden Earring).
He left the music industry in the '80's in order to concentrate on "normal" business, and made a name for himself in corporate and logistics consultancy. After a period with Texas Instruments, where his marketing strategy and lobbying led to the acceptance of hand-held programmable calculators throughout the EEC’s education system and a 78% market share for T.I., he accepted an offer from UK based Lex Service PLC. Starting with responsibility for project management and development strategy, he soon became an operating board member and strategist for Lex Specialist Transport division, consisting of a group of eight companies. After the Lex Group’s decision to divest from their transport and logistics interests, Sjoerd had the task of arranging management buyouts and company sales – and managed to do so without the loss of a single job of the 14.000 jobs involved.
Left with the two largest of Lex’s transport companies, he played a leading role in selling them to the US based Federal Express corporation, after which he joined the operating board of FedEx responsible for the launch and development of FedEx in Europe and the Middle East, a high profile and award winning corporate launch he completed in 1986. In 1988 Sjoerd left FedEx in order to establish a logistics and general business consultancy. He also decided that he wanted to bring his children up in a healthy environment and moved to a farm in rural North Yorkshire, U.K.
Sjoerd’s consultancy business thrived, and he developed an interest in sustainable agriculture and development. His farm operated in an environmentally friendly and efficient manner, without the use of chemicals. In addition he was involved in the development of alternatives to hardwood for stabling, non-harmful timber preservatives and many other environmentally friendly projects.
In the meantime Sjoerd’s consultancy practice undertook major corporate projects including; Massey Ferguson, the world’s largest tractor manufacturer by restructuring their logistics and workflow practices, re-structuring logistics operations for corporations such as Mothercare, Jaguar, Boots, Saab, Volvo, Toyota, Fisher HiFi and others, before being recruited by the UK government to assist in the introduction of market economy practices to conglomerates in the former USSR.
He returned to music in the late '90's, while working as an advisory board member and consultant for audio industry corporations such as JBL, Lucid, Symeterix. In 2001, he established a recording studio, Tantrum Studios, based in Santa Barbara, California. The design incorporated all Sjoerd had learned over the years. The studio is now gaining International recognition for its high quality sound and productions. One of its unique features is that only recycled or organic products have been used in its construction. Recycled rubber flooring, sound diffusion panel made from pressed straw, naturally dyed hemp cloth. Sjoerd established Tantrum Records in 2005, a production company and record label representing popular African artists.
As of the end of 2011 Sjoerd became the CEO of a new media corporation i.D.B. Media Group LLC, based in Carpinteria, California, USA. The corporation is in the process of building a new production facility. Incorporating the latest technology available the facility incorporates a sound stage, multi-room recording facility and editing suites. The corporation will incorporate Tantrum Records and its music production and will produce and distribute feature film and original television programming.
In 2012 Sjoerd was appointed a board member of Carpinteria based Lightwave Systems and Willcox Guitars, a company that produces high quality guitars with a unique infrared pickup system.
Apart from in music and business, Sjoko has achieved success in sailing, speed skating, car racing and horse breeding.

[[Human rights in Asia]]

CATEGORIES: Human rights by region

Human rights in Asia primarily rely on the protection and championing by states, non-governmental organizations, and individuals. Many countries in Asia are very backward in this aspect of public policy. It is believed to be a result of countries gaining independence from Colonial powers, rampant corruption within the governments or even resistance to change by the general populace. Unlike Europe and the Americas, most countries in Asia do not have an intergovernmental convention on human rights and have not signed any United Nations HR agreements.
Over the past few decades, the situation has generally improved, with progress varying significantly from not just country to country, but also between different areas of particular country. Bulk of Asias population is concentrated in China, India and the Middle East.http://esa.un.org/wpp/Documentation/publications.htm This is where many of the Human Rights violations take place.

[[Albemarle Barracks]]

CATEGORIES: American Revolutionary War prisoners of war held by Great Britain, Visitor attractions in Albemarle County, Virginia, Landmarks in Virginia, Prisoner-of-war camps

Albemarle Barracks was a prisoner-of-war camp for British prisoners during the American Revolutionary War.
Following Gen. John Burgoyne's defeat at the Battle of Saratoga, in 1777, several thousand British and German (Hessian and Brunswickian) troops, of what came to be known as the Convention Army, were marched to Cambridge, Massachusetts. For various reasons, the Continental Congress desired to move them south. One of Congress' members, Col. John Harvie/Harvey , Sr. and sons  offered some of his lands outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. The remaining soldiers (some 2,000 British, upwards of 1,900 German, and roughly 300 women and children) marched south in late 1778 - arriving at the site (near Ivy Creek) in January, 1779. As the barracks were barely sufficient in construction, the officers were paroled to live as far away as Richmond, Virginia and Staunton, Virginia. The camp was never adequately provisioned, and yet the prisoners did manage to make something of the site, including building a theater. Hundreds escaped Albemarle Barracks, owing to lack of an adequate number of guards. 
As the British army moved northward from the Carolinas, in late 1780, the remaining prisoners were moved to Frederick, Maryland, Winchester, Virginia, and perhaps elsewhere. 
The former site of Albemarle Barracks is on private Harvey property, northwest of downtown Charlottesville at the foot of Barracks Farm Rd.and marked by a Virginia State historical marker. In 1983, the Albemarle County Historical Society erected a plaque for the Albemarle Barracks burial site. Located on what is now Ivy Farm Drive, the spot marks the location of several graves found when the land was developed for residential use.  To see the marker, drive west of Charlottesville on Barracks Road to Barracks Farm Road. The marker is located on the north side of Ivy Farm Drive, in a private yard, a couple hundred yards from where this road separates from Barracks Farm Road.  
Note: Though the marker was almost totally obscured by the twin boxwoods growing on either side, in 2006, as of November 2010, it could easily be seen from the road.

Like virtually all beaches on the northern coast, Ruby Beach has a tremendous amount of driftwood.  It is notable for the number of sea stacks there.
The beach is so called, because of the ruby like crystals that get washed to the beach from the fresh water leaching onto the beach. These crystals are the by product of the
glacier activity that used to happen in this area. (Source: ranger station)

Tiversk or Tiversky gorodok ([tpl]lang-ru|Тиверск or Тиверский городок[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|Tiurinlinna[/tpl]) was a medieval Russian fortified settlement 215–300 m. long and 40–56 m. wide in the Karelian Isthmus, near Melnikovo, Leningrad Oblast. It was situated on an island of the River Vuoksi, which became a peninsula after 1857, near rapids.Лапшин В. А. Археологическая карта Ленинградской области. Часть 2. Санкт-Петербург:  Изд. СПбГУ, 1995. P. 165-167. ISBN 5-87403-052-2
The fort gained in prominence in 1323 when the Treaty of Nöteborg established a Novgorodian-Swedish border in the immediate vicinity. It was then mentioned in the Nikon Chronicle in 1404, when the settlement was granted to Prince Yury of Smolensk as an appanage. Seven years later, the fort was sacked and destroyed by the Swedes during one of the Swedish-Novgorodian Wars.

The following is a partial list of border incidents involving North Korea since the Korean Armistice Agreement of July 27, 1953, ended large scale military action of the Korean War.  Most of these incidents took place near either the Korean Demilitarized Zone or the Northern Limit Line. This list includes engagements on land, air, and sea, but does not include alleged incursions and terrorist incidents that occurred away from the border.
Many of the incidents occurring at sea are due to border disputes.

Albert John Weis (born April 2, 1938 in Franklin Square, New York) is a former Major League Baseball infielder.
Weis grew up in Bethpage, New York, and graduated from Farmingdale, New York, High School in 1955.  He was a high school teammate of Jack Lamabe, who pitched for several major league teams including the Red Sox, Mets, Pirates and Cardinals.
Weis played for the Chicago White Sox from [tpl]By|1962[/tpl] to [tpl]By|1967[/tpl] and the New York Mets from [tpl]By|1968[/tpl] to [tpl]By|1971[/tpl]. He was a switch-hitter until the end of the 1968 season, after which he batted exclusively right-handed. 
Signed by the White Sox as an amateur free agent, Weis played 99 games as a utility infielder in his rookie season of [tpl]By|1963[/tpl], with 48 of those games at second base and 27 at shortstop. In [tpl]By|1964[/tpl], he and Don Buford shared second base after the trade of popular veteran contact-hitting superstar Nellie Fox. Weis batted .247 and established career highs with 81 hits and 22 stolen bases; that year the White Sox finished second in a tight American League pennant race, one game behind the New York Yankees and one game ahead of the Baltimore Orioles.
Weis continued as a utility infielder with the White Sox for the next three years; the most at-bats he compiled during this period was only 187 in [tpl]By|1966[/tpl]. He broke a leg as the result of a violent collision at second base with Frank Robinson of the Orioles in mid-season of [tpl]By|1967[/tpl]. After that season, he and fleet-footed outfielder Tommie Agee were traded to the New York Mets for four players (among them slugger Tommy Davis and veteran pitcher Jack Fisher).
Weis earned a dubious place in history at the end of one of the longest major league games ever played. In the 24th inning of the Mets' April 15, [tpl]By|1968[/tpl] game against the Houston Astros in the Astrodome, Bob Aspromonte's bases-loaded ground ball went through Weis' legs for the only Met error of the marathon contest, scoring Norm Miller with the winning run for a 1-0 Astro victory. http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU196804150.shtml.  Weis was quoted afterward in the media as saying, "I blew it."
He was a member of the 1969 Miracle Mets team that unexpectedly won the World Series. In that Series, a Met upset of the powerful Baltimore Orioles in five games, Weis played a major role in both of Jerry Koosman’s victories, victimizing Oriole stalwart starter Dave McNally both times. In Game 2 in Baltimore, his top-of-the-ninth single scored Ed Charles with the eventual winning run in a 2–1 victory; in the clincher, Game 5 at Shea Stadium, after hitting only six home runs for his career to that point, all on the road, he homered off McNally in the seventh to tie the game at 3–3. (Ironically, one of Weis' six previous home runs was also at McNally's expense, on June 18, 1964 for the White Sox.) The Mets scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth to seal their improbable World Series win.
The 1969 World Series was Weis’ last moment of glory; he was released by the Mets on July 1, 1971. He had batted .218 lifetime with 346 hits, only seven of which were home runs, and 115 RBIs in 800 games played.

J. P. Sauer und Sohn GmbH (Sauer & Sohn) is a German manufacturer of firearms. Founded in 1751 in Suhl, Thuringia, Sauer & Sohn is the oldest firearms manufacturer still active in Germany. The company's production remained there for two centuries, before relocating to Eckernförde in 1951.  The move was precipitated by the fall of Nazi Germany, as the German military was responsible for the majority of the company's sales, and by the fact that the partition of Germany left Suhl in Communist East Germany.
Sauer & Sohn has manufactured both handguns and long arms, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns. Of particular note is the company's Sauer 38H, the first mass-produced semiautomatic pistol to feature a cocking/decocking lever.
Sauer & Sohn often collaborates with Swiss Arms AG (formerly SIG Arms AG) since the mid-1970s in the design and manufacture of semi-automatic pistols branded as "SIG-Sauer". Prior to this, a previous collaboration with Weatherby (1958 - early 1970s) was the mass production of their Mark V hunting rifles.  They are also well known for their hunting rifles.
JP Sauer & Sohn Gmbh is also a manufacturer of high pressure air & gas compressors.

The Gangbé Brass Band is a 10-member Beninese musical ensemble founded in 1994.   The word "gangbe" means "sound of metal" in the Fon language.  They blend West African jùjú and traditional Vodou music with Western jazz and big-band sounds.  Their unusual instrumentation---trumpet, trombone, and tuba, along with West African percussion and vocals---is, to some extent, part of West Africa's colonial legacy; French colonial officers imported brass instruments and trained local musicians to play European-style military and dance hall music.
Gangbe has released four albums: Gangbe (1998), Togbe (2001), Whendo (2004) and Assiko (2008), and tours extensively in Europe and North America.

[[Moab uranium mill tailings pile]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Grand County, Utah, Uranium mining in the United States

The Moab uranium mill tailings pile is a uranium mill waste pond situated alongside the Colorado River, currently under the control of the U.S. Department of Energy. Locals refer to it as the Moab Tailings Pile.
In 1952 Charlie Steen found the largest uranium deposit in the United States near Moab, Utah. The uranium was processed by the Uranium Reduction Company and the waste slurry was stored in an unlined pond adjacent to the river. The Uranium Reduction Company was sold in 1962 and renamed the Atlas Uranium Mill. 
After the mill was closed in 1984 the pond was capped. There was also a pile of mine tailings that was over 90 feet tall at its highest point.http://www.gjem.energy.gov/moab/documents/Crescent_Junction/RAS_RAP_July2008/RAS_RAPJuly2008.pdf It is believed that pollutants from the waste tailings is leaching into the river, inferred from the lethal effect on fish, primarily from high concentrations of ammonia. The site was transferred to the United States Department of Energy for remediation under Title 1 of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act in 2001.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/mill-tailings.html|publisher=Nuclear Regulatory Commission|title = Fact Sheet on Uranium Mill Tailings|accessdate=December 16, 2012[/tpl] In August 2005 the Department of Energy announced that 11.9 million short tons (10.8 million tonnes) of radioactive tailings would be moved, mostly by rail, and buried in a lined hole. The proposed holding site is public land at Crescent Junction, Utah, about 30 miles from the Colorado River. In February 2006 a final Environmental Impact Statement met with United States Environmental Protection Agency approval. The cost of the relocation was originally estimated to be $300 million, but 2008 Department of Energy estimates are in excess of $720 million.Salt Lake Tribune Editorial August 8, 2008 http://www.sltrib.com/ci_10144500"
The contract for the first transfer of the tailings has been awarded and the first relocation is expected to occur in late 2008. A series of works to extract and evaporate the water and ammonia from the pile before it reaches the Colorado River has been completed.

[[Arab–Khazar wars]]
CATEGORIES: 7th-century conflicts, 8th-century conflicts, Arab–Khazar wars, History of the Caucasus

The Arab–Khazar wars were a series of conflicts fought between the armies of the Khazar Khaganate and the Umayyad Caliphate (as well as its Abbasid successor) and their respective vassals. Historians usually distinguish two major periods of conflict, the First (сa. 642–652) and Second (ca. 722–737) Arab–Khazar Wars,Brook (2006), pp. 126–127 but the Arab–Khazar military confrontation involved several sporadic raids and isolated clashes as well, over a period from the middle of the 7th century to the end of the 8th century. 
The Arab–Khazar wars were a result of the attempts of the Umayyad Caliphate to secure control of Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus, where the Khazars were already established. The first Arab invasion, in the 640s and early 650s, ended with the defeat of an Arab force led by Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah outside the Khazar town of Balanjar. Hostilities broke out again with the Caliphate in the 710s, with raids back and forth across the Caucasus. Led by the distinguished generals al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah and Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, the Arabs were able to capture Derbent and even the southern Khazar capital of Balanjar, but this had little impact on the nomadic Khazars, who remained able to launch devastating raids deep into Transcaucasia. In one such raid in 730, the Khazars inflicted a major defeat on the Umayyad forces at the Battle of Ardabil, killing al-Jarrah, but were in turn defeated the next year and pushed back north. Maslama then recovered Derbent, which became a major Arab military outpost and colony, before being replaced by Marwan ibn Muhammad (the future caliph Marwan II) in 732. A period of relatively localized warfare followed until 737, when Marwan led north a massive expedition that reached the Khazar capital Atil on the Volga. After securing some form of submission by the khagan, the Arabs withdrew. 
The 737 campaign marked the end of large-scale warfare between the two powers, establishing Derbent as the northernmost Muslim outpost and securing Muslim dominance over Transcaucasia. At the same time, the long wars weakened the Umayyad army and contributed to the eventual fall of the dynasty a few years later. Relations between the Muslims of the Caucasus and the Khazars remained largely peaceful thereafter, apart from two Khazar raids in the 760s and in 799, each resulting from failed efforts to secure a marriage alliance between the Arab governors of the Caucasus and the Khazar khagan. Occasional warfare continued in the region between the Khazars and the local Muslim principalities of the Caucasus until the collapse of the Khazar state in the late 10th century, but the great wars of the 8th century were never repeated.

[[Loki's Wager]]

CATEGORIES: Verbal fallacies, Inductive fallacies, Arguments

Loki's Wager, a form of logical fallacy, is the unreasonable insistence that a concept cannot be defined, and therefore cannot be discussed.
Loki is a Jötunn or Áss in Norse mythology, who, legend has it, once made a bet with some dwarves. It was agreed that the price, should Loki lose the wager, would be his head. Loki lost the bet, and in due time the dwarves came to collect the head which had become rightfully theirs. Loki had no problem with giving up his head, but he insisted they had absolutely no right to take any part of his neck. Everyone concerned discussed the matter; certain parts were obviously head, and certain parts were obviously neck, but neither side could agree exactly where the one ended and the other began. As a result, Loki keeps his head indefinitely (although in the specific example, he got his lips stitched shut as payback for getting out of the bet with tricky wordplay).
The fallacy's focus on over-specification makes it in some ways the opposite of hasty generalization and could be considered an extreme form of equivocation. One may overcome the fallacy either by establishing a reasonable, working definition of the term in issue, or by showing that the other party is being unreasonable and avoiding the argument.

[[Sharpey's fibres]]
CATEGORIES: Musculoskeletal system

Sharpey's fibers (bone fibers, or perforating fibres) are a matrix of connective tissue consisting of bundles of strong collagenous fibres connecting periosteum to bone. They are part of the outer fibrous layer of periosteum, entering into the outer circumferential and interstitial lamellae of bone tissue.
Sharpey's fibres are also used to attach muscle to the periosteum of bone by merging with the fibrous periosteum and underlying bone as well. A good example is the attachment of the rotator cuff muscles to the blade of the scapula.
In the teeth, Sharpey's fibres are the terminal ends of principal fibres (of the periodontal ligament) that insert into the cementum and into the periosteum of the alveolar bone. http://www.dental.pitt.edu/informatics/periohistology/en/gu0404.htm> A study on rats suggests that the three-dimensional structure of Sharpey's fibres intensifies the continuity between the periodontal ligament fibre and the alveolar bone (tooth socket), and acts as a buffer medium against stress.
Sharpey's fibres in the primary acellular cementum are mineralized fully; those in cellular cementum and bone are mineralized only partially at their periphery.

In the skull the main function of Sharpey's fibres is to bind the cranial bones in a firm but moveable manner; they are most numerous in areas where the bones are subjected to the greatest forces of separation.  In the spine, similar fibres join the intervertebral disk to the adjacent vertebrae.   Each fibre is accompanied by an arteriole and one or more nerve fibres. [ref]

Scottish anatomist William Sharpey described them in 1846.

The Legislative Districts of Cebu, namely the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth districts, are the representations of the Province of Cebu and the independent city of Mandaue in the Philippine House of Representatives. From 1907 until 1972, Cebu Province was divided into seven congressional districts and Cebu City was part of its representation. From 1978 to 1984, it was part of the representation of Region VII, and from 1984 to 1986, it elected 6 assemblymen at-large.
The province's representation was reduced to six congressional districts upon the restoration of the House of Representatives in 1987 after Cebu City was given its own representations in Congress.
The passage of Republic Act 9726 separated the highly-urbanized city of Lapu-Lapu from the sixth district to form its own congressional district starting in the 2010 elections.

As a songwriter, Gripp is best known for fake jingles, as in his 2005 solo album For Those About to Shop, We Salute You - a 51-track concept album mimicking various musical styles as product commercials. It does not have one single concept; it goes through many various concept suites, such as trucks, beer, and insomnia. He also maintains a song-of-the-week website and a YouTube channel on which he creates soundtracks to internet memesParry Gripp, the Weird Al Yankovic of YouTube as well as music videos for his own novelty songs, with titles including "Do You Like Waffles?", "Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom", "Last Train to Awesometown", "Spaghetti Cat (I weep for you)", "Hamster on a Piano (Eating Popcorn)", "I Am A Banana" and "Baby Monkey (Going Backwards On A Pig)". Gripp also performs the Being Ian, Super Hero Squad Show, and Ben 10: Omniverse theme songs.
Gripp also joined forces with MC Lars to perform some of the vocals, including the chorus, to "Guitar Hero Hero (Beating Guitar Hero Doesn't Make You Slash)" a song commenting on the notion that video games like Guitar Hero take kids away from playing in bands and actually learning their instruments.
Along with faux jingles, Gripp also creates some real advertising music, such as Beatles-inspired tunes promoting the Wawa Food Markets' Breakfast Hoagiefest,Wawa Hoagiefest website and songs for the Hallmark Cards e-characters hoops&yoyo.
On July 9, 2009 Parry Gripp debuted a new song called "The Girl at the Video Game Store" for the 1000th episode of the G4 TV program Attack of the Show!

The Constitutio Romana (or “Roman Constitution”) was drawn up between King Lothair I of Italy (818–55), co-emperor with his father, Louis the Pious, since 817, and Pope Eugene II (824–27) and confirmed on 11 November 824. At the time the election of Eugene was being challenged by Zinzinnus, the candidate of the Roman populace. Eugene agreed to several concessions to imperial power in central Italy in return for receiving the military and juridical support of Lothair. The Constitutio was divided into nine articles.It can be founded edited by A. Boretius in Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Capitularia regnum Francorum, I, no. 161, 322–24. It introduced the earliest known Papal Oath, which the Pope-elect was to give to an imperial legate before receiving consecration. It also restored the custom established by Pope Stephen III in 769 whereby both the laity and clergy of Rome would participate in Papal elections. 
There has been some debate between modern scholars whether the Constitutio was a "dead letter" with little practical impact, or marked a stage of the road to imperial domination of the Papacy.Marios Costambeys, Power and Patronage in Early Medieval Italy (Cambridge: 2007), 342–43.

The Harper River is a tributary of the Wilberforce River which itself flows into the Rakaia River in New Zealand's Canterbury region.  It is located in the Southern Alps and a pass in the Harper River headwaters leads into the Waimakariri River catchment. One of the most popular tramping routes in Canterbury enters the East Harper via Cass Saddle and exits via Lagoon Saddle at the head of the West Harper.
The waters of the Harper River and its major tributary, the Avoca River, are channelled into Lake Coleridge via a structure known as the Harper Diversion which was constructed in 1921 as part of a hydroelectricity project.
The Harper Avoca catchment has been the site of much ecological research since the mid-1950s.
It is well serviced by huts on Lagoon and Cass Saddles, the West Harper, Hamilton Hut at the junction of the two branches of the Harper, Avoca Hut in the headwaters of the Avoca, two huts at Back Basins Creek, a small two man hut up Back Basins Creek and a larger hut that can be rented off Glenthorne Station near the junction of the Avoca and Harper Rivers. The Harper is comparatively well documented by early European explorers including Julius von Haast and Samuel Butler.

[[Bona Mors Confraternity]]

CATEGORIES: Confraternities, Religious organizations established in the 1640s, Christian organizations established in the 17th century

The Roman Catholic Bona Mors Confraternity (Bona Mors is Latin for "Happy Death") was founded 2 October, 1648, in the Church of the Gesu, Rome, by Father Vincent Carrafa, seventh General of the Society of Jesus, and approved by the Popes Innocent X and Alexander VII.Bona Mors Confraternity - Catholic Encyclopedia article
In 1729 it was raised to an archconfraternity and enriched with numerous indulgences by Benedict XIII. He authorized the father general of the Society of Jesus, who in virtue of his office, was the director, to erect confraternities in all churches of the Jesuit order. In 1827 Leo XII gave to the director general the power to erect and affiliate branch confraternities in churches not belonging to the Society of Jesus, and to give them a share in all the privileges and indulgences of the archconfraternity.
The object of the association is to prepare its members by a well-regulated life to die in peace with God. The longer title: "Confraternity of Our Lord Jesus Christ dying on the Cross, and of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, his sorrowful Mother," expresses the chief means to attain that end: devotion to the passion of Christ, and to the sorrows of Mary. Besides this union of prayers and good works of the associates and the special instructions at the public meetings help powerfully to prepare for a 'happy death '.
The conditions for membership are to present oneself to the director; to express to him one's desire to become a member; to receive from him an outward sign of acceptance, usually in the form of a certificate of admission; and to have one's name registered in the local Bona Mors register. Only "by an unusual and extraordinary exception," says a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Indulgences, "is it allowed to enroll those absent." The director is authorized to decide what constitutes such an exceptional case. The practices of the association and the indulgences granted to the members are specified in the manual of the confraternity (New York, 1896).

The Nigeria – São Tomé and Príncipe Joint Development Authority is an organization established by treaty that regulates the two countries' Joint Development Zone in the Bight of Bonny. The Joint Development Zone is along the maritime Nigeria – São Tomé and Príncipe border.
The Joint Development Zone is an area in the region of the Nigeria – São Tomé and Príncipe boundary region that is speculated to be rich in oil and gas reserves. Because neither country could have explored the resources in the zone without interfering with the maritime territory of the other country, the countries agreed in a treaty to create a joint development authority that would assist both countries in benefitting from the economic potential of the zone.
The Joint Development Authority has its head office located in Abuja, Nigeria. It was created by the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe on the Joint Development of Petroleum and other Resources, in respect of Areas of the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Two States. The treaty was signed in Abuja on 21 February 2001.

In the Street is a 16-minute documentary film released in 1948 and again in 1952.[tpl]cite web |title=Films Selected to the 2006 National Film Registry |url=http://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2006.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=2010-10-09[/tpl] The black and white, silent film was shot in the mid-1940s in the Spanish Harlem section of New York City. Helen Levitt, Janice Loeb, and James Agee were the cinematographers; they used small, hidden 16 mm film cameras to record street life, especially of children. Levitt edited the film and, subsequent to its first release, added a piano soundtrack composed and performed by Arthur Kleiner.From 1939 through 1967, Arthur Kleiner was the musical director for the film department of the New York Museum of Modern Art. He composed and performed piano scores for many silent films; his collection of 700 musical scores for silent films, which includes his own score for In the Street, is now archived at the University of Minnesota. See [tpl]cite web |title=Arthur Kleiner Collection |url=http://special.lib.umn.edu/rare/kleiner/history.html |accessdate=2010-10-10 |date=December 15, 1998 |publisher=University of Minnesota[/tpl]
The film is generally considered as an extension of Levitt's (now famed) street photography in New York City, and Levitt subsequently re-used the title, In the Street, for a volume reproducing her photographs.[tpl]cite journal |last=Arden |first=Roy |title=Useless Reportage - Notes on Helen Levitt’s In the Street |year=2002 |journal=Afterall |issue=6 |url=http://www.royarden.com/media/ardentexts/arden_levit.pdf |accessdate=2010-10-09[/tpl] Arden also notes that In the Street was an influence on Stan Brakhage's and Andy Warhol's filmmaking.[tpl]cite book|last=Levitt |first=Helen |title=In the Street: Chalk Drawings and Messages, New York City, 1938-1948 |year=1987 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0-8223-0771-5[/tpl] Loeb was a painter and photographer. James Agee was a noted writer; both Loeb and Agee subsequently collaborated with Levitt on a second film, The Quiet One (1948).
Manny Farber summarized the film at the time, "The movie, to be shown around the 16mm circuit, has been beautifully edited (by Miss Levitt) into a somber study of the American figure, from childhood to old age, growing stiffer, uglier, and lonelier with the passage of years."[tpl]cite book |last=Farber |first=Manny |title=Negative space: Manny Farber on the movies |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-306-80829-6 |pages=45–46 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=okhKPencylQC&pg=PA45[/tpl] This book is a collection of Farber's reviews; the original review appeared in The Nation. The artist Roy Arden recently summarized the film somewhat differently, "In The Street is reportage as art. It reports the facts, but for their useless beauty above all. While it could be argued that the film tells us how working class residents of Spanish Harlem lived in the 30’s and 40’s - how they looked and behaved, the addition of expository narration could have told us so much more. Statistics and other facts could have helped us put what we see into context and multiplied the use-value of the film. The absence of narration or other texts proves the artist's intent that we are intended to enjoy the film as a collection of beautiful appearances."
In 2006, In the Street was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[tpl]cite press release |title=Films Added to National Film Registry for 2006 |publisher=The Library of Congress |date=December 27, 2006 |url=http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-234.html |accessdate=July 22, 2009[/tpl] A videotape version of the film was released in 1996,[tpl]cite video |title=In the Street |medium=Videotape |date=1996 |publisher=Arthouse |location=New York[/tpl] but is apparently out of print.[tpl]cite web |url=http://shopping.icp.org/store/product.html?product_id=2014 |title=International Center of Photography - Store - In the Street |accessdate=2010-10-07[/tpl]

Euphemius was a Byzantine admiral, probably born in Messina. At ca. 826 according to Michele Amari,Amari, Storia dei musulmani di Sicilia, vol. I (ed. and rev. by C. Nallino) , Catania, 1933. the Emperor appointed a new governor of Sicily called either Constantine or Photinus, who in turn entrusted a naval command to Euphemius, a landowner with a large following; accused on a perhaps trumped-up charge of abducting a young nun from a convent, he organized an uprising against the Byzantine Emperor, Michael II and, after some military successes, proclaimed himself emperor in Syracuse, independent from Constantinople. In practice, he was a charismatic chief, and, respected as a king, the title of emperor meant that he dominated the whole territory of the island. Realising that he would be defeated by Byzantine troops when reinforcement were sent from the East, he appealed to Muslim leaders of Ifriqiya, where he asked the help of Arabs to take Sicily and Malta from the Byzantines.Peter Sammartino and William Roberts, Sicily: An Informal History pp. 43f.

He is considered to be the man who initiated the Arab invasion of Sicily and Malta and the beginning of the two-century Islamic domination on the island as the Emirate of Sicily.

CATEGORIES: Digital rights management systems, Television technology

Xtraview Video Encryption System refers to the now-defunct patented "encryption" system used on Xtraview and a number of other Top Up TV services, including Setanta Sports, Television X and Red Hot TV.
Unlike the other encryption system used by Top Up TV, Mediaguard, the Xtraview Video Encryption System was not a true encryption system. Instead, an MHEG application directed the user's set-top box to a hidden videostream when a correct PIN is entered. Unlike traditional channel encryption methods, Xtraview did not require a viewing card. This is an advantage over digital terrestrial television in the UK, where the vast majority of set-top boxes have no ability to decrypt pay channels.
Access to a channel protected using the Xtraview technology was granted by calling a premium rate telephone number. During the call, users were asked to give a number displayed on screen. In response, they were given a PIN to unlock the service.
[tpl]As of|2011[/tpl] a similar system is in use by Babestation Xtreme, Red Hot TV, Television X and briefly by the now defunct TView on digital terrestrial television.

[[Necklace (combinatorics)]]
CATEGORIES: Combinatorics on words, Enumerative combinatorics

In combinatorics, a k-ary necklace of length n is an equivalence class of n-character strings over an alphabet of size k, taking all rotations as equivalent. It represents a structure with n circularly connected beads of up to k different colors. 
A k-ary bracelet, also referred to as a turnover (or free) necklace, is a necklace such that strings may also be equivalent under reflection. That is, given two strings, if each is the reverse of the other then they belong to the same equivalence class.  For this reason, a necklace might also be called a fixed necklace to distinguish it from a turnover necklace.
Technically, one may classify a necklace as an orbit of the action of the cyclic group on n-character strings, and a bracelet as an orbit of the dihedral group's action.

Neofit Rilski ([tpl]lang-bg|Неофит Рилски[/tpl]) or Neophyte of Rila (Bansko, 1793 - January 4, 1881), born Nikola Poppetrov Benin ([tpl]lang-bg|Никола Поппетров Бенин[/tpl]) was a 19th-century Bulgarian monk, teacher and artist, and an important figure of the Bulgarian National Revival.
Born in the southwestern town of Bansko (or possibly in the village of Guliyna Banya) of Pirin Macedonia, Benin was educated to become a teacher, initially by his father Petar, and later at the Rila Monastery, where he studied iconography and had access to Greek and Church Slavonic books.  He went to Melnik in 1822, where he spent four years as a student of the noted teacher Adam, and perfected his Greek and Greek literature knowledge.
Initially working as a teacher in the Rila Monastery, he also spent time working in Samokov (1827–1831), then back in the monastery, then went to Gabrovo and Koprivshtitsa (1835–1839) and returned to the monastery as a teacher to join the theological school on the  island of Halki, where he spent four and a half years only to return to the Rila Monastery in 1852. He spent the remaining part of his life in Rila, and since 1860 was the monastery's hegumen. He stayed in the monastery despite being offered higher positions in the Orthodox hierarchy, such as becoming a bishop or the rector of the projected Tarnovo seminary.
In 1835, Rilski issued his Bolgarska gramatika, the first grammar book of the modern Bulgarian language. His other books include Tablitsi vzaimouchitelni, and the 1852 Greek-Slavic dictionary Slovar greko-slavyanskiy.
Neofit Rilski made the first popular translation of the Bible entirely in the modern Bulgarian language (not a mixture between Church Slavonic and vernacular elements), commissioned, edited and distributed by the American missionary Elias Riggs.Georgi Genov. American Elias Riggs and his contribution to the Bulgarian National Revival.  Historical Archives.  Sofia, Issue 9-10, November 2000 - May 2001.  (in Bulgarian)
Rilski considered Old Church Slavonic as synonymous with Old Bulgarian and he tried to unify West and Eastern Bulgarian dialects.[ref]Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770-1945)

James "Jim" Lewis (26 June 1927 – 21 November 2011) was an English footballer. He was one of the most successful amateur footballers of his generation.
Lewis, educated at the Monoux School, Walthamstow, began his football career as a 16-year-old with the famous amateur side Walthamstow Avenue (his father had also played for them) and in three stints with the club scored 423 goals in 522 appearances, mainly as a centre forward. He had briefly left Walthamstow in November 1950 to play for Leyton Orient, but after playing as an amateur in 4 League games he rejected their contract terms. Lewis was a key part of the Walthamstow side which reached the FA Cup fourth round in 1953, beating sides such as Stockport County and Watford and drawing 1-1 with Manchester United at Old Trafford, before losing 5-2 in the replay. Just days later, Lewis received a telephone call from Chelsea manager Ted Drake, and promptly signed for the club.
In the days when the disparity between the pay of amateur and professional footballers was minimal, Lewis never turned professional, although his Chelsea team mate Derek Saunders, who also played for Walthamstow, did. He juggled his playing time with working as a salesman for Thermos flasks which, unlike many of his fellow players, allowed him to have a car. With Roy Bentley established as the Chelsea's centre forward, Lewis was switched to either outside or inside left. He made his Chelsea debut in October 1952 against Charlton Athletic and scored in a 2-2 draw.
His most noteworthy contribution to Chelsea was to be a member of their 1954–55 championship-winning side. He played in 17 league games that season, and scored 6 goals, including crucial goals in wins over Bolton Wanderers, Sheffield United and Tottenham Hotspur. Chelsea's professional players each received a suit to commemorate the success, but Lewis instead received an illuminated address from the club. Lewis remained with Chelsea until 1958, and scored 40 goals in 95 appearances for the club. He was also a member of the representative London XI which competed in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1958. He played in the 6-0 second-leg loss in the final against FC Barcelona.
Lewis won 49 caps for the England amateur national side, and also played for the Great Britain football team at the 1952, 1956 and 1960 Olympic Games.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Sports Reference|title=Jim Lewis Biography and Statistics|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/le/jim-lewis-1.html|accessdate=27 October 2009[/tpl]

Charles Bertrand (January 11, 1824 – April 2, 1896) was a Quebec businessman, seigneur and political figure. He represented Témiscouata in the 1st Canadian Parliament as a Conservative member.
He was born Charles-Frédéric Bertrand in L'Isle-Verte, Lower Canada in 1824, the son of Louis Bertrand, who purchased the seigneury of Île-Verte in 1849. He attended the Petit Séminaire de Québec. In 1850, Bertrand married Arthémise Dionne, daughter of Benjamin Dionne, and, that same year, his father gave him control over the seigneury. He owned several mills, a factory producing agricultural implements, a foundry and four schooners. He owned cutting rights for timber and operated a sawmill; he also owned a store in L'Isle-Verte. He served as mayor there in 1859 and from 1881 to 1885. Bertrand was also a director of the Témiscouata Railway.
He died in L'Isle-Verte in 1896. Just before his death, the industrial empire that he had built there began to fall apart, due to competition from other companies, bad luck, his son's lack of interest in the business and the unexpected death of Jean-Baptiste Raymond, whom he had been grooming to take over the operation.

Anemurium, in modern Turkish Anamur, in Ancient Greek Ανεμούριον, Anemourion, was a major city of the Roman province of Rough Cilicia, the Byzantine Cibyrrhaeot Theme. Its bishopric is now included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.
It was situated near a high bluff knob (Cape Anamur) that marks the southernmost point of Asia Minor, opposite Cyprus.
The ruins of its theatres, tombs and walls are still visible and were first mentioned by Francis Beaufort, an English naval captain who explored the south coast of Turkey in 1811-12 and who published his discoveries in Karamania.  Excavations directed by Professor Elizabeth Alfoldi, University of Toronto (1965–1970), and subsequently James Russell, University of British Columbia (1971-2000?), along with his colleague Hector Williams and his wife Caroline, have revealed extensive traces of the city's buildings, tombs and history from the 1st century after Christ until the city's abandonment around 650 when Arab attacks made the coast unsafe.  Teams have uncovered a large theater, a small covered theater or odeon, several public baths decorated with mosaic floors (some converted to industrial use in late antiquity), four early Christian churches (also with mosaic floors and donors' inscriptions), a possible civil basilica (law court), sections of the city walls and aqueducts, and a number of minor structures.  Work in the city's extensive necropolis of several hundred tombs built above ground has revealed and conserved wall paintings (including the four seasons) and more mosaic floors.  Anemurium had its own mint which produced coins from the late 1st century CE to its capture by the Sassanians in 260, an event that sent the city into decline for many decades. In medieval times the Kingdom of Little Armenia established a castle, known as Mamure Castle, near the city.

[[Brain stimulation reward]]

CATEGORIES: Perception

Brain stimulation reward (BSR) is a phenomenon in which direct stimulation of regions of the brain through either electrical or chemical means is rewarding and can serve as an operant reinforcer. The stimulation activates the reward system and establishes response habits similar to those established by natural rewards such as food and water.Wise RA. "Addictive Drugs and Brain Stimulation Reward." Annual Reviews. 1996; 19:319-340. BSR experiments soon demonstrated that stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus and other regions of the brain associated with natural reward was both rewarding as well as drive inducing.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wise|first=RA|title=Brain reward circuitry: insights from unsensed incentives.|journal=Neuron|date=Oct 10, 2002|volume=36|issue=2|pages=229–40|pmid=12383779[/tpl] Electrical brain stimulation and intracranial drug injections are among the most powerful rewards because they activate the reward circuitry directly rather than through the peripheral nerves.Wise RA et al. "Brain Dopamine and Reward." Annual Reviews. 1989; 40:191-225. BSR has been found in all vertebrates tested, including humans, and it has provided a useful tool for understanding how natural rewards are processed by the brain as well as the anatomical structures and the neurochemistry associated with the brain's reward system.Rolls ET. "The Neurophysiological Basis of Brain Stimulation Reward." Brain Stimulation Reward. 1975; 5:65-88.

It is located on State Highway 77 and was served by the Whitecliffs Branch, a branch line railway, from the line's opening on 3 November 1875 through to its closure on 31 March 1962.  Few remnants of the railway remain in the town, with the station's platform incorporated into the backyard of a private residence.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 1995), 71-2.
Industrial activity such as lignite coal mining and the manufacture of pottery and bricks used to take place in the region around Glentunnel.  This was the reason the railway was built, but activity declined sharply in the 20th century and has been effectively non-existent since the 1980s.Selwyn District Council, "Glentunnel and Coalgate", accessed 19 May 2008.

Coalgate is a locality in the Selwyn District of the Canterbury region of New Zealand's South Island.[tpl]LINZ|20277|Coalgate|2 April 2008[/tpl]  The 2001 New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings gave Coalgate's population as 276, and it is located roughly an hour west of Christchurch on State Highway 77.  The town's name stems from it being the "gateway" to the lignite coal fields around Whitecliffs, the Rakaia Gorge, and Acheron River.  Coal mining declined in the 20th century and has now ceased, but since the 1950s, commercial processing of bentonite has taken place in Coalgate.Selwyn District Council, "Glentunnel and Coalgate", accessed 19 May 2008.
On 3 November 1875, the Whitecliffs Branch railway was opened, with a station in Coalgate.  It was here that a private line diverged from the state-operated New Zealand Railways Department network.  On 31 March 1962, the railway closed, but some of the line's old formation and the Coalgate station platform can still be found.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 1995), 71-2.
Notable features are the Coalgate Tavern and the Coalgate Cabins, both situated on the main road to Hororata. Coalgate also has a walkway through the old Coalgate Domain. In addition to these there is also a Coalgate Bowling green. The town has access to the Selwyn river and is closely situated to Glentunnel.

[[Fantasy auto racing]]
CATEGORIES: Fantasy sports

Fantasy auto racing is a type fantasy sports game based on motor sports. Players, also known as fantasy team owners, select a roster of drivers to earn points according to actual race results. Player scores, as determined by their drivers' actual racing results, are sorted within a league of players to determine weekly, periodic and championship winners. Games can be free or pay-to-play with cash or merchandise as prizes. 
Inspired by the popularity of Fantasy football, American fantasy auto racing games began in the late 1980s but didn't become popular until the advent of the internet. Games are usually based on activities and race results from the most popular, broadcast-live forms of motor sports like Formula One, NASCAR, IndyCar, Daytona Prototype and the American Le Mans Series racing. Fantasy auto racing games can be run season-long, from Winter Speed Weeks at Daytona through the last major race weekend of the season, or they are segmented to award quarterly prizes and attract new players throughout the year.  
Fantasy racing rules, formats and point systems vary widely. Most American games follow NASCAR Sprint Cup racing and award driver points based on the official NASCAR points system. To reduce the likelihood of ties, game rules can restrict driver starts according to criteria based on salary caps, driver rankings or frequency of selection. Games that follow one specific series combine driver or roster salary caps with a point system based on predictions for driver pit strategy, advancement or retreat from starting position, fastest lap or qualifying performance. Other games follow the results of all the top stock car racing, open wheel racing, drag racing and sports car racing series and require players to pick at least one driver from each race per weekend in filling out a seven driver roster.

The mine is broadly similar to the M15 anti-tank mine in appearance with the addition of four pairs of small ridges on the top surface of the mine. The mine has two secondary fuse wells in addition to the primary fuse well and can be set to operate either as an anti-vehicle or anti-personnel mine. It is normally fitted with either an M603 or M608 fuse. Upon activation the bursting charge breaks the thin steel casing open, heating and spraying the VX nerve agent to form an aerosol.

[[Yury of Smolensk]]
CATEGORIES: Russian leaders, Politics of Muscovy, 1407 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Yury Svyatoslavich or Georgy Svyatoslavovich ([tpl]lang-ru|Юрий Святославович[/tpl] or Георгий Святославович) was the last sovereign ruler of the Principality of Smolensk and Bryansk (1386–95, 1401–04) whose life was spent in vain attempts to fend off aggression by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
In 1386 a war broke out between Algirdas' sons, Skirgaila and Andrei of Polotsk. The latter fled from Polotsk to Smolensk and asked Yury's father for help. The armies of Smolensk and Skirgaila clashed near Mstislavl in the Battle of the Vikhra River. After Yury's father was killed in battle and his brothers were taken prisoner, the Lithuanians approached Smolensk and allowed Yury to assume the throne on certain conditions, after exacting a sizable indemnity from him.
In 1395, while Yury was visiting his father-in-law, Oleg Korotopol of Ryazan, Grand Duke Vytautas the Great (Vitovt) of Lithuania took Smolensk and installed his governor there. Four years later, Vytautas was routed by the Tatars in the Battle of the Vorskla River. In 1401, Yury and Oleg made use of his plight to retake Smolensk and Bryansk, where the pro-Lithuanian boyars were promptly executed.
In fall 1401, Vytautas laid siege to Smolensk but was forced to retreat after signing an armistice. Two years later, Smolensk withstood a two-week siege by Vytautas. Solicitous to preclude a new attack, Yury went to the Grand Duchy of Moscow to ask Vasily I for help against Vytautas (who was Vasily's father-in-law). Although Yury promised to bequeath his possessions to Vasily, the Muscovite ruler hesitated to accept this proposal, until the boyars of Smolensk opened the city gates to Vytautas and surrendered Yury's capital to his old enemy in 1404. Thus Smolensk was lost to Russians for more than a century.
As Vasily was eager to accuse Yury of shortsightedness, the latter left Moscow and proceeded with his son to Novgorod, where he was treated honourably and was given an appanage of thirteen towns, including Porkhov and Tiversk. In 1406, he returned to Moscow, reconciled himself with Vasily and was sent to govern Torzhok in his name. While there, he attempted to seduce the wife of his cousin, Prince Semyon of Vyazma. When she refused his advances, Yury killed her and her husband and, afraid of the imminent punishment, fled to the Golden Horde, where he died soon thereafter, in 1407.
Yury had two daughters, Anastasia, wife of Grand Duke Švitrigaila of Lithuania, and Elena, wife of Yury of Zvenigorod and mother of the famous Dmitry Shemyaka.

[[Liverpool hospitalité]]
CATEGORIES: Hospitalités of Lourdes

The Liverpool Hospitalité is a voluntary organisation associated with the annual Liverpool Archdiocesan Pilgrimage to Lourdes. The Hospitalité of Our Lady of Lourdes (Liverpool Branch) spend their pilgrimage caring for those who need support both while travelling and whilst in Lourdes. They also provide support for registered sick and disabled pilgrims who are able to stay in hotels. Like all Hospitalités of Lourdes it is connected to the Hospitalité Notre Dame de Lourdes.
The first official Liverpool Pilgrimage took place in 1923, during which Mr Jack Traynor, a man with severe war wounds, was spontaneously cured.  He lived to return to Lourdes acting as a brancardier many times and was one of the pre-war Presidents of the Brancardiers Association.
Until November 1927, when Liverpool Association of Handmaids was formed, the volunteers to help the nursing staff with the care and transportation of the sick pilgrims were obtained by simply appealing to actual pilgrims either just before departure or in Lourdes itself.
With the ever increasing numbers of sick cases it was realised that a permanent organisation of voluntary helpers who would be prepared to work in raising funds and to go as often as possible with the Liverpool Pilgrimage was needed.
The Association came into being at a meeting held in St John's Hall, Kirkdale in November 1927 and so regular work in assisting with the Pilgrimage on an all the year round basis began.
During 1928 the Confraternity of the Hospitalité of Lourdes was raised by the pope to the rank of an Archconfraternity with the power to affiliate similar diocesan organisations and in July 1928 a petition was sent to Lourdes for affiliation of the Liverpool Association.  This was granted, and so all our registered members are entitled to gain the indulgences of the Archconfraternity.
In the years of World War II there were no Pilgrimages, and the opportunity was taken after consultation with the Lourdes Hospitalité - to revise the constitutions of the Brancardiers and the Handmaids Associations.  The new constitutions were approved and signed by the Archbishop of Liverpool on May 14. 1948, with subsequent revision in 1974.  In 1998 the constitution was comprehensively amended and this combined Brancardier and Handmaid associations.
The hospitalite present their members with service medals. After three years service a hospitalier will receive a heart shaped medal with a blue bar, after five this will be replaced by one with a red bar and for 10 years service a yellow bar is received. These medals are not worn as a decoration they are merely to indicate the level of experience that member has. This is reflected by the fact that there are no further medals received after 10 years despite some members having served with the Hospitalite for as many as fifty prilgramages.

HEC-RAS is a computer program that models the hydraulics of water flow through natural rivers and other channels.  The program is one-dimensional, meaning that there is no direct modeling of the hydraulic effect of cross section shape changes, bends, and other two- and three-dimensional aspects of flow.  The program was developed by the US Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers in order to manage the rivers, harbors, and other public works under their jurisdiction; it has found wide acceptance by many others since its public release in 1995.
The Hydrologic Engineering CenterHEC.usace.army.mil (HEC) in Davis, California developed the River Analysis System (RAS) to aid hydraulic engineers in channel flow analysis and floodplain determination.  It includes numerous data entry capabilities, hydraulic analysis components, data storage and management capabilities, and graphing and reporting capabilities.

Three singles were released from this album: "Sunset Now" (UK#24), "This is Mine" (UK#23) in 1984, and an edited remix of "...(And That's No Lie)" (UK#52) in early 1985, which was the first Heaven 17 single to fail to reach the UK Top 40 since "Let Me Go" at the end of 1982.
Although digital sample-based instruments such as the Fairlight CMI and the Linn LM-1 drum machine were still responsible for most of the album's sounds, How Men Are marked the beginning of an increased usage of acoustic instruments in Heaven 17's music.  A small orchestra is employed on three tracks, and two tracks make use of The Phenix Horns Esquire, Earth, Wind & Fire's famous brass section. Another notable contribution to this album was made by the vocal group Afrodiziak, who sang on four tracks.

[[Plated wire memory]]
CATEGORIES: Computer memory, Non-volatile memory

Plated wire memory is a variation of core memory developed by Bell Laboratories in 1957. Its primary advantage was that it could be machine-assembled, which potentially led to lower prices than the hand-assembled core.
Instead of threading individual ferrite cores on wires, plated wire memory used a grid of wires coated with a thin layer of iron-nickel alloy (called permalloy). The magnetic field normally stored in the ferrite core was instead stored on the wire itself. Operation was generally similar to core, but could also be built with a non-destructive read that did not require refreshing.
Plated wire memory has been used in a number of applications, typically in aerospace. It was used in the UNIVAC 1110 and UNIVAC 9000-series computers, the Viking program that sent landers to Mars, the Voyager space probes, a prototype guidance computer for the Minuteman-III, the Space Shuttle Main Engine Controllers,[tpl]cite web|last=Tomayko|first=James|title=Chapter Four:  Computers in the Space Shuttle Avionics System|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/computers/Ch4-7.html|work=Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl] KH-9 Hexagon reconnaissance satellite[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/GAMHEX/HEXAGON/52.PDF|title=The HEXAGON story|publisher=National Reconnaissance Office|year=1988[/tpl] and in the Hubble Space Telescope.

[[Julien Saubade]]
CATEGORIES: 1983 births, French rugby union players, Living people, Rugby union wings, Biarritz Olympique players, Racing Métro 92 players, Stade Français rugby players

Julien Saubade (born 5 November 1983 in Bayonne) is a French rugby union footballer, currently playing for the Paris rugby club Racing Métro in the top level of French club rugby, the Top 14. His usual position is on the wing.
Saubade was originally playing with Biarritz Olympique, where he had been developed, though he moved to US Dax, playing in the Pro D2, initially for the 2003 season, but he ended up staying there until July 2005, since he could not get the opportunity to play in Biarritz's first team.  He was the second division's top scorer with 12 tries. The club did not seem to be ready to trust him despite his selections in the French U-19 and then U-21 teams (alongside Julien Arias and Arnaud Marchois whom he was to join in Paris).
Therefore he moved to Paris to play for Stade Français, among the élite of French rugby.  At the start, the transition from the Pro D2 to the Top 14 was quite hard for him, and Saubade made several unusual mistakes for such a promising player like him, notably one which made Paris' coach, Fabien Galthié, furious and which cost his team to lose a match in Montpellier. As a consequence, Saubade was advised to readapt through the Stade Français' Espoirs (Juniors) team for a time, to gain experience from training with many of his new international teammates, to work physically, and then, thanks to some injuries among the starters he was given another chance to show his talent again and he seized it well to say the least.
During the Six Nations Championship and after, he played all the matches, and scored 6 tries. Saubade also played in his club's semi-final of the 2005-06 Top 14, which they eventually lost to Toulouse, 12 to 9 and in Heineken Cup matches.
He moved to the other major Paris club, Racing Métro, for the 2009–10 season, and has remained there since.

[[Harzburgite]]

CATEGORIES: Ultramafic rocks

The ultramafic igneous rock, harzburgite, is a variety of peridotite consisting mostly of the two minerals, olivine and low-calcium (Ca) pyroxene (enstatite); it is named for occurrences in the Harz Mountains of Germany. It commonly contains a few percent chromium-rich spinel as an accessory mineral. Garnet-bearing harzburgite is much less common, found most commonly as xenoliths in kimberlite. 
Harzburgite typically forms by the extraction of partial melts from the more pyroxene-rich peridotite called lherzolite. The molten magma extracted from harzburgite may then erupt on the surface as basalt. If partial melting of the harzburgite continues, all of the pyroxene may be extracted from it to form magma, leaving behind the pyroxene-poor peridotite called dunite. Harzburgite may also form by the accumulation of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene in large magma chambers of basalt deep in continental crust (layered intrusions).

Amelius read and wrote voraciously, memorized practically all the teachings of Numenius, and, according to Porphyry, wrote over 100 volumes of sayings and commentaries. Plotinus considered Amelius one of his sharpest disciples. It was Amelius who convinced Porphyry of the truth of the doctrines of Plotinus,Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 18 and joined with him in the successful effort to induce Plotinus to commit his doctrines to writings.Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 5 His principal work was a treatise in forty books arguing against the claim that Numenius should be considered the original author of the doctrines of Plotinus.Porphyry, Vit. Plotin. 16-18 Amelius is also cited by Eusebius and others as having quoted with approval the definition of the Logos in the Gospel of John.Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica xi. 19Theod.

CATEGORIES: Central Semitic languages, Arabic languages, Languages of Saudi Arabia, Languages of Eritrea, Hejaz

Hejazi Arabic ([tpl]lang-ar|حجازي[/tpl] ḥijāzī), also known as West Arabian Arabic, is a dialect of the Arabic language spoken in the Hejaz region in Saudi Arabia. Although, strictly speaking, there are two distinct dialects spoken in the Hejaz region, one by the bedouin rural population, and another by the urban population, the term most often applies to the urban variety, spoken in cities such as Jeddah, Mecca, Yanbu, and Medina. 
Urban Hejazi appears to be most closely related to the Arabic dialects of Northern Sudan and Upper Egypt (Ingham 1971). Hejazi Arabic has many close similarities to Egyptian Arabic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|year=2001[/tpl] Hejazi Arabic dialect is also spoken by Rashaida in Eritrea and Sudan. Hejazi Arabic is used for daily communications and has no official status, instead, Modern Standard Arabic is used in official purposes, especially Eritrea where Arabic is not the lingua franca.

Jurançon is a wine region in South West France in the foothills of the Pyrenees, around the commune of Jurançon. It produces a dry white wine and a more sought after sweet white wine. The grape varieties used are Gros Manseng, Petit Manseng and Courbu. The sweet wines develop aromas of tropical fruit such as pineapple and mango. The vines are grown on steep mountain slopes and for the sweet wines the grapes are often hand selected well into October and November to ensure the best noble rot characteristics - although Tim Wildman MW states that noble rot is not the origin of sweetness in these wines.

[[Bengali novels]]
CATEGORIES: Bangladeshi novels, Bengali literature, Bangladeshi literature

Bengali novels occupy a major part of Bengali literature. Though the first Bengali novel was Karuna O Phulmonir Bibaran (1852), the Bengali novel actually started its journey with Durgeshnandini written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in 1865. According to Ananda Sanker and Lila Ray, 'when the novel was introduced in Bengali in the middle of the 19th century, the form itself was new, the prose in which it was written was new, the secular tone was new in a country hitherto wholly dominated by religion, and the society in which and for which it was written was new’ (Page 168). But some great novelists like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindranath Tagore, Manik Bandopadhyay, Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay developed the newly introduced genre in such a way that ‘new’ changed into ‘matured’ through their works. Almost all these literary activities went on in full swing in Kolkata. Dhaka, on the other hand, could not participate in the early stage but literature created by and of the people of Bangladesh area later on flourished with notable success.

Johnny's outfit included a red long-sleeve jogging suit (the top had "Johnny Hero" and the number "16" (sixteen) printed on the front); gold shorts, white socks and white tennis shoes. The body was made of heavy foam, with a plastic head and hands. His right hand projected a metal rod or prong to help hold sports balls and equipment. Several sports team uniforms were made available, including the Washington Redskins and other NFL or AFL teams. Uniforms included plastic helmets and were sewn/printed in team colors.

[[Cell physiology]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology, Physiology

Cell physiology (including cellular electrophysiology) is the biological study of the cell's mechanism and interaction in its environment. The term "physiology" refers to all the normal functions that take place in a living organism. Absorption of water by roots, production of food in the leaves, and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology.  The heterotrophic metabolism of food derived from plants and animals and the use of movement to obtain nutrients (even if the organism itself remains in a relatively stationary position) are characteristic of animal physiology.
In the context of human physiology, the term cell physiology often specifically applies to the physiology of membrane transport, neuron transmission, and (less frequently) muscle contraction. In general, these cover the digestion of food, circulation of blood, and contraction of muscles and, therefore, are important aspects of human physiology. For a more complete description of the general physiological function of human cells (as well as the cells of other life forms), see the article on cell biology

[[The Guarani]]
CATEGORIES: 1857 novels, Novels by José de Alencar, Portuguese-language novels, 1600s in fiction, Novels set in Brazil

The Guarani: Brazilian Novel ([tpl]lang-pt|O Guarani: Romance Brasileiro[/tpl]) is a 1857 Brazilian novel written by José de Alencar. It first came out as a feuilleton in the newspaper Diário do Rio de Janeiro, but due to its enormous success Alencar decided to compile his writing in a volume. A plausible explanation for this success might be in the fact that novel spoke of freedom and independence, arguing for a nativeness that could be found in tropical Nature and in the indigenous people of Brazil.
Years later the novel was turned into an opera performed in Italian and called Il Guarany (1870), by Carlos Gomes, among other places it was presented in Milan and New York (it is a known fact[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] that the author did not appreciate the final result). O Guarani is regarded a foundational text of Brazilian Romanticism, but it gained international projection by being translated into Spanish, German (Der Guarany, Brasilianischer Roman, Maximillian Emerich, 1876) and English (The Guarany, Brazilian novel, James W. Hawes, 1893).
The novel is still widely read nowadays, especially at Brazilian schools as an introduction to novel reading, but also by anyone who enjoys a thrilling adventure story. Literary criticism has tended to link O Guarani to the works of Fenimore Cooper, Chateaubriand and the noble savage from the Rousseauesque tradition. However, this interpretation of the novel has become outdated as recent academic works show also how dark, sexual, gothic and lyrical (over narrative, unlike the Fenimore Cooper model) the novel is.

[[Sedbusk]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in North Yorkshire, Wensleydale

Sedbusk is a hamlet near Hawes and Hardraw Force within the Yorkshire Dales in North Yorkshire, England.
Sedbusk is an attractive, small Upper Wensleydale village situated halfway up a fell on the south facing side of the beautiful, broad sweeping valley that comprises Wensleydale. Forming its backdrop this fell climbs to over 2000 feet, part craggy and part moorland at its summit. 
Served by a narrow, twisting and fairly steep road which comes to an abrupt halt at the end of the village there is no through traffic and a peaceful, relaxing, almost sleepy atmosphere abounds. There are around 30 houses, cottages and converted barns in the village, all stone built, dating mostly from the 18th Century, and spread higgledly-piggledly over its confines. 
Indeed hardly any two front doors face the same direction, a modern day planners nightmare perhaps, but for those who appreciate a more traditional and less regimented village development, Sedbusk has a deal of character and charm to recommend it. The panoramic view from Sedbusk is over Upper Wensleydale. Perched overlooking the valley bottom you can follow the River Ure as it winds its way through green, drystone meadows where cows and sheep peacefully graze, down the Dale towards Aysgarth Falls. On the fellside pastures above the river thickets of woods, stone barns, farms and isolated houses are dotted here and there which become barer as they lead up to the moorland summit of Weather Fell. Completing the scene are the confluence of hills around Hawes that give rise to its name ("Haas" - ancient Norse dialect for pass through the mountains).
A picture of Sedbusk in 1911 can be found at this external link http://www.francisfrith.com/search/england/north+yorkshire/sedbusk/photos/sedbusk_63511.htm

John Rennie High School (JRHS), located in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada, is an English language secondary school which opened in 1955. The school was named after John Rennie (1904–1952), the Union Nationale Member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for Huntingdon from 1947 to 1952.
Pointe-Claire was and remains in a riding that has voted for the Quebec Liberal Party; thus, when local representatives made their case to Premier Maurice Duplessis for the building of a new high school to meet the needs of the burgeoning post-World War II school population, Premier Duplessis' stipulation for the funding was for the building to be named after his recently deceased fellow Union Nationale MNA and longtime party fundraiser. However, this was not completely a partisan political decision of Premier Duplessis, as John Rennie had been the Assistant Director of Protestant Schools in Pointe-Claire from 1930 to 1936, as well as Principal of the Valois Park and Cedar Park Schools.
John Rennie is administered by the Lester B. Pearson School Board.
In 1969, John Rennie was expanded which added 2 new gymnasiums, a caffeteria, a library, several new hallways as well as a state of the art audiotorium. This expansion over doubled the school's enrollement.

Vivian Martin (July 22, 1893 - March 16, 1987) was an American stage and silent film actress. She was born in Sparta, Michigan and began her career as a child actress on the stage with comedian Lew Fields. Her early theatrical appearances included Stop Thief, Officer 666, The Only Son and  with Richard Mansfield in Cyrano de Bergerac.
A winsome and pretty blonde, Martin entered the motion pictures industry in 1914. With her then long hair she played the type of role similar to Lillian Gish. Her first role was in The Wishing Ring: An Idyll of Old England (1914) for the World Film Company, in which she played Sally, a parson's daughter. Martin subsequently became a contract player for the Famous Players Film Company, where she achieved popularity as a "rival" to Mary Pickford. Among her other credits are The Third Kiss (1919), Her Official Fiancee (1919), The Innocent Adventuress (1919), and Louisiana (1919). She made forty-four movies in all, including some for the Fox Film Corporation.
In the early 1920s Martin started her own production company and released her films through the Goldwyn Corporation. Her career entered into a downward spiral soon afterwards as a result of a lawsuit for payment of studio rentals. Although eventually settled out of court, the case did irreparable damage to her popularity.
In April 1921 Martin left movies and returned to the stage. Her theatrical revival began with a three-act comedy entitled First Night Out by Adelaide Matthews and Ann Nichols.
Vivian Martin died in New York, New York in 1987, aged 93. Her obituary in the New York Times noted her philanthropy and association with the Professional Children's School in New York. She contributed to the lives of young performers as both a friend and benefactress.
At one time Martin was married to actor William Jefferson. Several of Martin's early and rare films survive at the Library of Congress.

[tpl]coord|6|30|N|92|45|E|display=title|type:event[/tpl][tpl]Campaignbox Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811[/tpl]The Action of 18 November 1809 was the most significant engagement of a six-month cruise by a French frigate squadron in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. The French commander, Commodore Jacques Hamelin, raided across the Bay of Bengal with his squadron and achieved local superiority, capturing numerous merchant ships and minor warships. On 18 November 1809, three ships of Hamelin's squadron encountered a convoy of India-bound East Indiamen, mainly carrying recruits for the Indian Army, then administered by the Honourable East India Company (HEIC).
Despite spirited resistance from the largest British merchant ship, Windham, the failure of the other Indiamen to support their leader and the size and power of the French ships forced the British to withdraw: all the HEIC ships were subsequently captured by the larger, faster French warships. A month later, Hamelin's raiding campaign skirted disaster when a winter hurricane on the voyage back to Île de France almost wrecked his flagship Vénus. Vénus only survived with the co-operation of the British prisoners aboard, who brought the ship safely to port. Only two of the captured Indiamen were successfully brought to Ile de France: the same storm that nearly destroyed Vénus scattered the squadron and its prizes, allowing a patrolling British frigate to recapture Windham just a few miles from the French island.

[[Geoweb]]

CATEGORIES: Buzzwords, Geographic information systems, Geographical technology, Web 2.0 neologisms, World Wide Web, Words coined in the 1990s

The Geospatial Web (pronunciation: 'gēō-spãy-shee-ăl wěb') or Geoweb are computer networks which pair geographic (e.g. two-dimensional maps) or geospatial (e.g. three-dimensional pictures) underlay systems with Geotag overlay systems for the purpose of connecting users with other network locations.  Today's free and popular Geobrowsers are examples of simple Geoweb service implementations.  Complex Geoweb services provide users access to applications and files, within the context of specific physical locations on earth.
The concept of a Geospatial Web may have first been introduced by Dr. Charles Herring in his US DoD paper, An Architecture of Cyberspace: Spatialization of the Internet, 1994, U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory ([tpl]Coord|40|8|58.9|N|88|16|22.7|W|name=U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory[/tpl]).
Dr. Herring proposed that the problem of defining the physical domain in a computer or cyber-infrastructure, providing real time and appropriate fidelity, required a cyber-spatial reference or index combining both Internet Addressing and Hierarchical Spatial Addressing.
As such, the Geoweb would be characterized by the self synchronization of network addressing, time and location.  The Geoweb would allow location to be used to self organize all geospatially referenced data available through the Internet.{http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.37.4604}
The interest in a Geoweb has been advanced by new technologies, concepts and products, specifically the popularization of GPS positioning with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007.
Virtual globes such as Google Earth and NASA World Wind as well as mapping websites such as Google Maps, Live Search Maps, Yahoo Maps, and OpenStreetMap have been major factors in raising awareness towards the importance of geography and location as a means to index information.
The increase in advanced web development methods such as Ajax are providing inspiration to move GIS (Geographical Information Systems) into the web.
GeoTags are Icons located within GeoBrowsers which, when clicked, perform a computing operation. In 2012, David Joshua Plager, AIA, conjectured that GeoTags, located within GeoBrowsers and associated with Postal Addresses, would, in the future, be relied upon by the Users of one or many Security as a Service Corporation(s) to connect individuals, businesses and machines working on and sharing proprietary (building) information.
Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) has emerged as an academic community interested in technical aspects of helping people find information about places.  In order to make information accessible from geographically oriented applications, coordinate metadata must be created via some form of geocoding or geoparsing process.  After obtaining geographic coordinates, they must be indexed in useful ways that allow people to interact with the non-geographic nature of the content, e.g. viewing photographs or keyword searching.
The semi-annual Geoweb Summits in New York have covered the emerging geoweb industry since 2010, connecting GIS and mobile LBS with Internet of Things and augmented reality.

John Eugene (Jack) Billingham (born February 21, 1943) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers ([tpl]By|1968[/tpl]), Houston Astros ([tpl]By|1969[/tpl]-[tpl]By|1971[/tpl]), Cincinnati Reds ([tpl]By|1972[/tpl]-[tpl]By|1977[/tpl]), Detroit Tigers ([tpl]By|1978[/tpl]-[tpl]By|1980[/tpl]) and Boston Red Sox ([tpl]By|1980[/tpl]).[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VgoLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lFEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5471,3941033&dq=jack-billingham+red-sox&hl=en|title=Billingham to Red Sox|date=13 May 1980|work=The Bryan Times|publisher=UPI|page=11|accessdate=1 June 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Nicknamed "Cactus Jack", the 6-foot-4 hurler won at least 10 games for 10 consecutive seasons, and he helped lead Cincinnati's legendary "Big Red Machine" to back-to-back World Series titles in 1975 and 1976. He batted and threw right-handed. Billingham is the cousin of Christy Mathewson.
Billingham proved to be one of baseball's greatest World Series pitchers. In seven games (including three starts) for Cincinnati, he went 2–0 with a 0.36 ERA, allowing just one earned run in 25.1 innings pitched. Jack came to the Reds in one of baseball's biggest trades. The Reds sent Lee May, Tommy Helms and Jimmy Stewart to the Astros for Billingham, Joe Morgan, Denis Menke, César Gerónimo, and (then minor leaguer) Ed Armbrister prior to the 1972 season.
Originally signed as a free agent by the Dodgers in 1961, Billingham was groomed as a reliever in the Los Angeles farm system, reaching the major leagues in 1968.  Despite a good season (50 games, 3–0 record, 8 saves, 2.14 ERA), the Dodgers left Billingham unprotected in the expansion draft and he was selected by the Montreal Expos, though he would never pitch for them.  In January, 1969, the Expos traded Donn Clendenon to the Houston Astros for Rusty Staub.  Clendenon refused to report, and Billingham was later sent to Houston to complete the trade.  In 1969, Billingham was again used as a reliever (52 games, 6–7 record, 4.25 ERA).  In 1970 he was moved into the starting rotation (46 games, 24 starts), before becoming exclusively a starting pitcher in 1971.  
On April 4, 1974, Billingham gave up Hank Aaron's 714th career home run, which tied Aaron with Babe Ruth for #1 on the all-time home run list at the time.
For his career, Billingham went 145–113 with a 3.83 ERA and 1,141 strikeouts in 2,230.2 innings.

Joe Hamill (born 25 February 1984 in Bellshill) is a Scottish professional footballer currently with Formartine United in the Scottish Highland Football League.
Hamill had a spell as a teenager playing for East Stirlingshire Boys Club until he joined the youth development scheme at Hearts, graduating from there to the youth academy in 2000. Known as a hard working and tricky winger, he was promoted in April 2002 to the first team squad after major roles in the Under-18's and Under-21's. He was featured in the side that won Youth League championship in season 2000–01.
Hamill was on the fringes of the first team squad in season 2002–03, however during the following season he started to play more games for the first team, making 20 competitive appearances. He also obtained a massive confidence boost when, in May 2004, he scored the only goal in a SPL match against Rangers at Ibrox.
During the 2004–2005 season, Hamill gained competitive European experience by playing during the Tynecastle outfit's UEFA Cup campaign. He also scored the winner in the Edinburgh derby against Hibernian in the same week his manager Craig Levein quit the club to go take charge of Leicester City in the Championship.
In August 2005, Hamill was signed by his former Hearts boss Craig Levein for Leicester, joining former Jambo team-mates Mark de Vries, Alan Maybury and Patrick Kisnorbo. He scored his first goal for the club after 37 minutes of his debut in a League Cup defeat of Bury and made his league debut a week later, coming off the bench in the 1–1 draw away to Hull City.
On 28 July 2006, it was announced that Hamill had parted ways with Leicester City after just 11 months at the club, having his contract terminated by mutual consent. His then manager Rob Kelly, who had replaced Levein in early 2006, said that Hamill had left the club to seek first team football elsewhere. He also said Hamill was a smashing lad and never caused an ounce of trouble at the club.
On 2 August 2006, he joined Livingston on a free transfer.
On 29 January 2010, Dumfries club Queen of the South confirmed that Hamill had signed with Steve Tosh moving in the opposite direction in a loan deal.
On 1 June 2011, Kirkcaldy club Raith Rovers signed Hamill on a 2-year contract.Extension Granted & Midfielder Signs

Bishop Nectarios was a priest in Australia when he read an appeal in a church magazine for missionaries to revive the Orthodox Church in Madagascar. There had been two Orthodox Churches in the country, mostly supported by Greek expatriates, but a military coup in 1972 had resulted in the expulsion of the clergy.
Nectarios pleaded with his bishop (the Bishop of Adelaide) to let him go to Madagascar, but the bishop at first refused, saying that he was too useful to him where he was. Eventually, however, the bishop relented, saying that he knew Nectarios would just be miserable if he were forced to stay. 
Nectarios made contact with the publisher of the Greek magazine that contained the appeal, and asked who had written it, and was rather taken aback to learn that it was not an appeal from Orthodox Christians in Madagascar asking for a priest, but that the publisher himself had thought it would be a good idea. Nectarios realised that it would be pioneering missionary work. 
Nevertheless he went to Madagascar, which is part of the Greek Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa. He made contact with the families who were looking after the church buildings, and took the son of one of the families with him on his missionary journeys, travelling around the island to villages where there seemed to be no churches, and arranging with the headman of the village to preach the gospel there if anyone was interested. In this way he established several parishes. He sent the young man who had first accompanied him to the theological seminary in Nairobi, and established a school and an orphanage. 
On 11 September 2004 he was killed in a helicopter crash along with Petros VII, Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa, and several other clergy.http://articles.cnn.com/2004-09-11/world/greece.crash_1_helicopter-crash-top-cleric-archbishop-christodoulos?_s=PM:WORLD

Marion Tinsley Bennett (June 6, 1914 – September 6, 2000) served the United States for over 56 years in all three branches of the federal government of the United States, having been a federal judge, a member of Congress, and a colonel in the Air Force Ready Reserves.
Born in Buffalo, Missouri on June 6, 1914 to Philip Allen Bennett and Mary Bertha (Tinsley) Bennett, he received his A.B. from Southwest Missouri State University in 1935 and earned a J.D. from the School of Law at Washington University in St. Louis in 1938, after which he entered private practice. In 1941 he married June Young; they had two children, William and Ann, and four grandchildren, Jiffy, James, John, and Anna. 
While practicing law, he was elected to the Greene County, Missouri Republican Central Committee, and managed his father's two Congressional election campaigns. When his father died in office in early 1943, Marion was chosen in a special election to complete his father's term in the 78th Congress. He was 28 years old. Winning reelection twice, he served in the 79th and 80th Congresses. 
Marion Bennett was part of an official ten member Congressional delegation invited by General Dwight D. Eisenhower to follow the United States Third Army into Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar, Germany in 1945. The delegation's members toured the United States speaking and reporting on what they had seen of the horrific conditions in the camp. Bennett is quoted in the New York Times on May 6, 1945, "I left Buchenwald convinced that every German must be killed."New York Times: May 6, 1945
Losing his reelection bid in 1948, Bennett was appointed a trial commissioner to the federal Court of Claims, starting the day after his term ended, January 4, 1949. In 1950 he became an Air Force Reserve Colonel, a position he held until 1974. He also rose to become Chief Trial Commissioner at the Court of Claims in 1964, and was nominated in 1972 to be an Associate Judge. By enactment of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 he became a Circuit Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. He became a Senior Circuit Judge on March 1, 1986, and continued to sit until 1997. He died in Alexandria, Virginia, on September 6, 2000, and is buried in Springfield, Missouri.

Churchill Forge Mill is a water powered forge mill. It is situated in the village of Churchill, which is near Hagley, in the English county of Worcestershire. Until the early 1970s was operated as a working business, producing metal tools such as spades, shovels and ladles. It is one of the last water powered forge mills remaining in an intact state in the UK and as such is an important example of the industrial heritage of the West Midlands.

The two water wheels at the forge have been restored to working condition and it is also possible to view the original belt driven machinery at the site as well as displays of the tools made there and photographs of the forge during its working days. The site is now maintained and operated by the Churchill Forge Trust. 

Visitors are welcomed to the site on selected dates between Easter and October; usually Easter Monday followed by the second Sunday of each month. Full details on open days are available at the Churchill Forge Website.[tpl]cite web | title = Churchill Forge Mill Website | url = http://www.churchillforge.org.uk/ | publisher =  Churchill Forge Trust | accessdate = August 2, 2006 [/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Native American leaders, 1830 births, 1910 deaths, People from Montana, Interior Salish

Chief Charlo (Claw of the Little Grizzly or Small Grizzly-Bear Claw) lived from 1830-1910 in the Bitterroot Valley and served as head chief of the Bitterroot Salish from 1870 to 1910.  He was appointed chief upon death of his father, Chief Victor (Many Horses or Plenty-of-Horses).  Chief Victor was a principal signer of the Treaty of Hellgate in 1855.  Chief Charlo, like Chief Victor before him, followed a policy of peace with the American settlers in Southwestern Montana and the soldiers at nearby Fort Missoula. In November 1891 Chief Charlo and a small remnant of the Bitterroot Salish were forced by a contingent of troops from Fort Missoula to move from the Bitterroot Valley to the Flathead Reservation.  Chief Charlo had three children from his marriage to Margaret: Martin, Ann Felix, and Victor. Victor became head chief upon the death of Chief Charlo on January 10, 1910.
A speech printed in 1876 by Montana newspapers expressed the frustration and betrayal felt by Chief Charlo towards the white settlers and the U.S. military and government representatives. In part it read:
[tpl]quote|Since our forefathers first beheld him...whiteman has filled graves with our bones...His course is destruction.  He spoils what the Spirit who gave us this country made beautiful and clean.  But that is not enough.  He wants us to pay him besides his enslaving our country...and...that degradation of a Tribe who never were his enemies.  What is he?  Who sent him here?  We were happy when he first came...To take and to lie should be burned on his forehead, as he burns the sides of my horses with his own name.  Had heaven's Chief burnt him with some mark, we might have refused him.  No, we did not refuse him in his weakness.  In his poverty we fed, we cherished him-yes, befriended him, and showed the fords and defiles of our lands...We owe him nothing.  He owes us more than he will pay...His laws never gave us a blade of grass nor a tree nor a duck nor a grouse nor a trout...You know that he comes as long as he lives, and takes more and more, and dirties what he leaves.[tpl]cite quote|date=April 2014[/tpl] [/tpl]
The town of Charlo, Montana and Chief Charlo Elementary School, in Missoula, Montana, are named after him.

[[On the Halonnesus]]

CATEGORIES: Works by Demosthenes

On the Halonnesus ([tpl]lang-grc|Περὶ τῆς Ἀλοννήσου[/tpl]) is a political oration attributed to the prominent Athenian statesman and orator Demosthenes. 
The speech constitutes an Athenian response to a letter of Philip II of Macedon, with which the King of Macedon proposed the amendment of the most important term of the Peace of Philocrates ("each side should keep the territory possessed at the moment of the official conclusion of the peace treaty"). In exchange he offered to the Athenians the island of Halonnesus. The orator rejects Philip's demands and proposes instead the mediation of arbitrator, in order to settle their differences. Libanius, who wrote 57 hypotheses or introductions to Demosthenes' orations predicates that On the Halonnesus does not belong to Demosthenes, but to Hegesippus, another prominent member of the anti-Macedonian faction. A. Galinos supports Libanius' position, pointing that this speech differs in terms of style and argumentation from the other orations of Demosthenes.A. Galinos, Comments on Demosthenes, 347-349.

[[Lonesome Traveler]]
CATEGORIES: 1960 novels, 20th-century American novels, Novels by Jack Kerouac

Lonesome Traveler is a collection of short stories and sketches by American novelist and poet Jack Kerouac, published in 1960. It is a compilation of Kerouac's journal entries about traveling the United States, Mexico, Morocco, the United Kingdom and France, and covers similar issues to his novels (see Bibliography of Jack Kerouac), such as relationships, various jobs, and the nature of his life on the road. Some of the stories originally appeared as magazine articles.
The collection includes some of Kerouac's best writing in his spontaneous prose style. This is particularly evident in "Mexico Fellaheen" and "The Railroad Earth" (also known as "October in the Railroad Earth") which, added to his travel journal entries, produce a loose but effective collection.
"Alone on a Mountaintop" recounts Kerouac's three-month stay on Desolation Peak as a lone fire lookout, which is also described (although somewhat differently) in The Dharma Bums and Desolation Angels.
The book begins with Kerouac's answers to a publisher's questionnaire, about his life and work.

CATEGORIES: Tropical cyclone meteorology

Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) is a computerized model developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the National Weather Service (NWS), to estimate storm surge depths resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes.See: External links. The model functions by taking into account a storm's pressure, size, forward speed, forecast track, wind speeds, and topographical data.
SLOSH is used to evaluate the threat from storm surge, and emergency managers use this data to determine which areas must be evacuated. SLOSH output is used by the National Hurricane Program (NHP) when conducting Hurricane Evacuation Studies as a hazard analysis tool for assisting with the creation of state and local hurricane evacuation plans or zones. SLOSH model results are combined with roadway network and traffic flow information, rainfall amounts, river flow, or wind-driven waves to determine a final analysis of at-risk areas.

[[Spider anatomy]]

CATEGORIES: Spider anatomy

The anatomy of spiders includes many characteristics shared with other arachnids. These characteristics include bodies divided into two segments, eight jointed legs, no wings or antennae, the presence of chelicerae and pedipalps, simple eyes, and an exoskeleton, which is periodically shed.
Spiders also have several adaptations that distinguish them from other arachnids. All spiders are capable of producing silk of various types, which many species use to build webs to ensnare prey. Most spiders possess venom, which is injected into prey (or defensively, when the spider feels threatened) through the fangs of the chelicerae. Male spiders have specialized pedipalps that are used to transfer sperm to the female during mating. Many species of spiders exhibit a great deal of sexual dimorphism.[tpl]cite journal|author=Reiskind, J. |title=The Taxonomic Problem of Sexual Dimorphism in Spiders and a Synonymy in Myrmecotypus (Araneae, Clubionidae) |year=1965 |journal=Psyche |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=279–281 |url=http://psyche.entclub.org/72/72-279.html |doi=10.1155/1965/17894[/tpl]

[[Samuel Mohilever]]

CATEGORIES: Religious Zionist Orthodox rabbis, Zionists, 1824 births, 1898 deaths, Hovevei Zion, Forerunners of Zionism

Samuel Mohilever (1824–1898), also Shmuel Mohilever, was a rabbi, pioneer of Religious Zionism and one of the founders of the Hovevei Zion movement.
Mohilever was born in Głębokie (now Hlybokaye, Belarus) and studied in the Volozhin yeshiva.
After the pogroms following the May Laws, he helped found the Hovevei Zion in Warsaw, and convinced Baron Edmond James de Rothschild to financially support a settlement called Ekron (now Qiryat Ekron).
Mohilever was made the Rabbi of Białystok in 1883. He dedicated himself to promote Zionism by convincing Białystok's Jews to move to Petah Tikva, then a struggling settlement.
In 1884, Mohilever was elected to the presidency of the Hovevei Zion conference, with Leon Pinsker serving as chairman. Mohilever served as chairman in the 1887 and 1889 conferences. Many of his contributions were of a religious nature - Mohilever insured that Jewish farming in Palestine complied with Jewish laws and tradition by setting up a rabbinical committee to oversee it.
In 1893 there were a series of differences between Rabbi Mohilever and the main offices of Chovevei L'Tzion in Odessa, which was largely secularist and directed by Leo Pinsker. This led to  a decision for Chovevei L'Tzion to make another Centre under Mohilever's leadership. This new branch, was named Mizrachi, (A Hebrew abbreviation of merkaz ruhani – "spiritual centre"). Their task was to educate orthodox Jews about the concept of Zionism.
But despite the religious differences, Rabbi Mohilever made the wise decision to remain part of the Chovevei L'Tzion movement. Nonetheless, Mohilever put constant pressure on the national movement to meet with the requirements of the Orthodox Jews.
In 1897 Mohilever sent a message to the First Zionist Congress: 'It is essential', he wrote, 'that the Congress unite all "Sons of Zion" who are true to our cause to work in complete harmony and fraternity, even if there be among them differences of opinion regarding religion.'
Rabbi Mohilever and his colleagues continued their work, especially among Orthodox Jews, and as a result, Mizrachi became the foundation of the religious Zionist movement. In 1902, four years after Rabbi Shmuel’s death, Mizrachi officially joined the Zionist Organization.
When in 1901 Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines and other of Mohilever's disciples re-established the organization, they did so with the same stance, spirit and name. Mohilever had successfully inspired the amalgamation of traditional Jewish orthodoxy with practical Zionism.Arthur Hertzberg, The Zionist Idea, (Meridian, New York, 1960), p.400-402.
His last letter to the Jews of Russia before his death urged them to work to achieve a deep attachment to the commandment to settle in Israel, which he said is “the foundation of the existence of our people.”
The kibbutz Gan Shmuel was named after Mohilever.
Mohilever was active in the propagandist and organizational affairs as well as labors on behalf of colonization in Palestine. As early as 1882, he went to Paris to meet a young Baron Edmond de Rothschild, and convinced him to take an interest in the struggling settlers in Israel. With the help of Rabbi Mohilever, Rothschild stayed and was the single greatest benefactor of Zionist work there.

In 1897, after assuming the position of photographer to Tsar Nicholas II,He never officially received the title of the Photographer of the Imperial Court - see his correspondence with the Ministry of the Court preserved at the State Archives in St. Petersburg and Krasnogorsk. he used the Lumières' Cinématographe to record the official visit to St. Petersburg, of the French President Félix Faure. After the visit, Otto von Bismarck accused Faure of not baring his head before the Russian flag on his disembarkation. However, this accusation was shown to be false based on Matuszewski's documentary.
Matuszewski wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema: Une nouvelle source de l'histoire (Paris, 1898) and La photographie animée (1898).  Une nouvelle source de l'histoire is recognized today as the first written work to consider the historical value of film and to suggest the importance of Film Archives.

The name is a historical reference to the past agricultural practice of growing cotton in the Utcubamba Valley.[tpl]cite web|title=Utcubamba River|url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Utcubamba_river.html|publisher=Speed Look|accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl]  [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]
The Utcubamba River originates in the highlands of the central mountain range, then it flows north through the Amazonas Region before joining the Marañón River. The semitropical valley of the river is the former site of the pre-Columbian Chachapoyas culture and a popular tourist destination. Its many tributaries support the towns and farms of La Peca, Copallín, Cajaruro, Shipasbamba, La Florida, and Yambrasbamba.
Numerous hydroelectric dams have been built on the Utcubamba River from which a large portion of the Amazon Region derives its electricity. The Utcubamba River also passes through the Utcubamba Valley and is the source of irrigation for most of the cultivation done here. The tropical climate of the valley combined with the availability of water for the farms has helped to make this area one of the biggest producers of crops like maize, rice and banana.[tpl]cite web[/tpl]

[[Gugalanna]]
CATEGORIES: Epic of Gilgamesh, Mesopotamian gods

In Mesopotamian mythology, Gugalanna (lit. "The Great Bull of Heaven" Gugalanna was the first husband of the Goddess Ereshkigal, the Goddess of the Realm of the Dead, a gloomy place devoid of light, who was dispatched by Inanna to punish Gilgamesh for his sins.  Gugalanna was sent by the gods to take retribution upon Gilgamesh for rejecting the sexual advances of the goddess Inanna.  Gugalanna, whose feet made the earth shake, was slain and dismembered by Gilgamesh and Enkidu.  Inanna, from the heights of the city walls looked down, and Enkidu took the haunches of the bull shaking them at the goddess, threatening he would do the same to her if he could catch her too.  For this impiety, Enkidu later dies.
It was to share the sorrow with her sister that Inanna later descends to the Underworld.
Taurus was the constellation of the Northern Hemisphere Spring Equinox from about 3,200 BCE.  It marked the start of the agricultural year with the New Year Akitu festival (from á-ki-ti-še-gur10-ku5, = sowing of the barley), an important date in Mespotamian religion.  The "death" of Gugalanna, represents the obscuring disappearance of this constellation as a result of the light of the sun, with whom Gilgamesh was identified.
In the time in which this myth was composed, the New Year Festival, or Akitu, at the Spring Equinox, due to the Precession of the Equinoxes did not occur in Aries, but in Taurus.  At this time of the year, Taurus would have disappeared as it was obscured by the sun.

Like all the eels of the genus Anguilla and the family Anguillidae, it is catadromous, meaning it spawns in the sea but lives parts of its life in  freshwater. The spawning area of this species is in the North Equatorial Current in the western North Pacific to the west of the Mariana Islands. The larvae are called leptocephali and are carried westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the Kuroshio Current to East Asia where they live in rivers, lakes and estuaries.  The Japanese eel is an important food fish in East Asia where it is raised in aquaculture ponds in most countries in the region.

[[Carinthian Matadors Rugby Football Club]]
CATEGORIES: Austrian rugby union teams

Carinthian Matadors Rugby Football Club are a rugby union club in the Österreichischer Rugby Verband, they currently play in the Austrian Challenge Cup.
The club was founded by Mike Wagner and Volker Mannheim in 2003. The Matadors played their first friendly, a 15-a-side against Rugby Club Innsbruck, with help from the clubs in Graz and Linz. Paternion was also the venue for a preparation game between the Austrian national team and Udine Rugby Football Club. 
The Matadors take part in the Austrian Challenge Cup since 2004. Steadily improving their game, they have managed so far to win three games. Top scorers are Jürgen Friedrich, Mathias Genser, Roland Gfrerer, Mike Wagner (in alphabetical order). The main handicap in the further development of the club is the low number of active players, currently about a dozen; a problem that will hopefully be addressed by raising increased awareness for the game. 
The club hosted the match between Austria and Estonia of the Central Europe Development Tri-nations rugby league competition on 2 September 2006. This was the first ever Rugby League game in Austria. Matadors's Mathias "Mote" Genser won the man of the match award for Austria. 
The inaugural Carinthian Sevens took place on the 9th of September 2006, the "ållarerstes internationales Paternioner Kirchtågsturnier" in Carinthian German. 
Teams from as far afield as Moldova (RC UTM being the eventual winners), Slovenia and Germany participated. The success, especially due to the traditional and not so traditional entertainment available after the rugger - the event was held in conjunction with the local fair - encourages the Matadors to repeat the event next year on the second weekend of September, open to all interested teams and clubs.  
The season 2008/09 marks a big step in the development of the club. Together with another club based in Carinthia, the Carinthian Bulldogs, founded early in 2008, the Matadors have been invited by the Austrian Rugby Union to participate - as Team Carinthia - in the forthcoming Second National Division. 
The club's homeground in Paternion is currently Austria's only full-size permanent rugby ground. The Matadors actively promote the pitch for other unions, clubs and teams to use as a venue for internationals, friendlies and training camps.

Martin de Maat (January 12, 1949 – February 15, 2001) was a teacher and artistic director at The Second City in Chicago.  He also taught at Columbia College and Players Workshop.  He studied under Viola Spolin.  De Maat and Del Close were the two main figures of the Chicago improvisational comedy scene in the late 80's and throughout the 1990s.
De Maat began working at The Second City as a teenager washing dishes in the kitchen and began teaching classes at The Second City for his aunt, Josephine Forsberg, when he was 18 years old. He instantly became a favorite teacher at The Second City, as well as supporting the shows by doing lights and stage managing. He studied theater at the University of Iowa and would much later receive a PhD from National University in Kanpur in communication arts.  In 1974 he moved to New York City, where he became a very successful director and art director in both theater and film. During this period Martin returned to Chicago every summer to teach improv for his aunt's new school, Players Workshop, which acted as The Second City's unofficial training program. In 1984 Martin returned to Chicago semi-permanently and began to teach improv full-time at the Players Workshop, helping his aunt, Josephine Forsberg to develop the school.  About that time, friend and colleague Sheldon Patinkin asked Martin to join the staff of the recently created The Second City Training Center, the theater's official improv training program.  In 1985 Martin became its artistic director and led the development of the acting, writing and improvisation programs for the next 15 years, making it the biggest and most successful improv training program in the country.  Martin became well known as a transformative and empowering teacher, who greeted his students with a hug and referred to The Second City as their home. He was not only an improv comedy teacher to them but also a life counselor and a father figure who helped to guide them to get in touch with their creativity and give up their restrictive ways of thinking.
Martin de Maat died on February 15, 2001 of complications from pneumonia.  Always a very private person in the public eye, he never revealed his age.  The Chicago Sun-Times published it in his obituary at "around 52."  It also came as a shock to many that knew him that he had been living with AIDS for several years.  After his death, he received many honors and memorials, especially in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles where many of his students and colleagues teach, direct and perform.  At The Second City Training Center in Chicago in the early 2000s, an ongoing performance series was named in his honor, The de Maat Showcase.  A plaque in his honor hangs on the wall at the training center. 
In 2009, the de Maat Studio Theater was opened in his honor at The Second City in Chicago.
Some of Martin de Maat's students over the years include:  Mick Napier, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Scott Adsit, Rachel Dratch, Sean Hayes, Tina Fey, and a young David Mamet.

[[Equity stripping]]

CATEGORIES: Equity (law), Real estate

Equity stripping, also known as equity skimming, is a type of foreclosure rescue scheme. Often considered a form of predatory lending, equity stripping became increasingly widespread in the early 2000s. In an equity stripping scheme an investor buys the property from a homeowner facing foreclosure and agrees to lease the home to the homeowner who may remain in the home as a tenant. Often, these transactions take advantage of uninformed, low-income homeowners; because of the complexity of the transaction, victims are often unaware that they are giving away their property and equity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] Several states have taken steps to confront the more unscrupulous practices of equity stripping. Although "foreclosure re-conveyance" schemes can be beneficial and ethically conducted in some circumstances, many times the practice relies on fraud and egregious or unmeetable terms.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Scheme Preys on Desperate Homeowners  |url= |quote=With the housing market in decline, financial predators are finding yet another way to take advantage of people who fall behind on their payments.

The schemes take various forms and often involve promises to distressed homeowners of cash upfront, free monthly rent and a chance to retain their houses in the long run. But in the process, someone else takes over the deed, borrows as much as possible against the value of the house and pockets the cash. And, almost always, the homeowners still end up losing their homes. |publisher=New York Times |date=July 3, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-03 [/tpl]

St. David's Shopping Centre is a shopping complex in Swansea, south Wales.  The complex is located adjacent to the Quadrant Shopping Centre and opposite St Mary's Church. Completed in 1982, the complex has thus far been fairly unsuccessful, in terms of filling its outlet spaces and retaining customers.
The complex consists of several buildings, clad in red brick, which comprise a number of shop units at ground level which are directly accessible from the street.  There was a market hall on the first floor which is now closed.BBC News - Swansea's St David's Shopping Centre to be demolished During the 1980s the upper floor area was open and contained many small stalls run by local traders.  To the south of the complex lies the St. David's car park.
An octagonal building located in the north west corner of the complex was occupied by S4C as a studio for a number of years.  The studio was used for broadcasting the Heno programme.this is South Wales - Plea to help traders in 'neglected' shops zone (2 December 2011)  The building was originally built to be occupied by a restaurant but it was never taken up for this purpose.  For most of the building's lifetime so far, it has been unoccupied.
Also, there have been many plans for the old shopping centre including demolition and expansion of the adjacent Quadrant shopping centre; or total demolition and to be replaced by a multi-storey car park.  If approved it would have led to the demolition of the Quadrant and St, Davids car parks to expand the Quadrant shopping centre.  All of the plans include the Quadrant as an integral part.  Swansea Council and the Welsh Government bought the complex in December 2011 with a plan to demolish the empty part of the site to create a 160 space car park.Wales Online - Shopping centre in Swansea to be partially demolished

[[Osmotherapy]]
CATEGORIES: Neurology procedures

Osmotherapy is defined as the use of osmotically active substances to reduce the volume of intracranial contents. Osmotherapy serves as the primary medical  treatment for cerebral edema. The primary purpose of osmotherapy is to improve elasticity and decrease intracranial volume by removing free water, accumulated as a result of cerebral edema, from brain's extracellular and intracellular space into vascular compartment by creating an osmotic gradient between the blood and brain. Normal serum osmolality ranges from 280-290 mOsm/L and serum osmolality to cause water removal from brain without much side effects ranges from 300-320 mOsm/L. Usually, 90 mL of space is created in the intracranial vault by 1.6% reduction in brain water content. Osmotherapy has cerebral  dehydrating effects.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Stephan|coauthors=Chong J|title=Critical Care Management of Increased Intracranial Pressure|journal=J Intensive Care Med|year=2002|volume=17|pages=55–67[/tpl] The main goal of osmotherapy is to decrease intracranial pressure(ICP) by shifting excess fluid from brain. This is accomplished by intravenous administration of osmotic agents which increase serum osmolality in order to shift excess fluid from intracellular or extracellular space of the brain to intravascular compartment. The resulting brain shrinkage effectively  reduces intracranial volume and decreases ICP.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kalita|first=J|coauthors=Ranjan P, Misra U|title=Current Status of Osmotherapy in Intracerebral Hemorrhage|journal=Neurology India|date=March 2003|volume=51|issue=1|pages=104–109|pmid=12865537[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Hays|first=Angela|coauthors=Lazaridis C, Neyens R, Nicholas J, Gay S, Chalela J|title=Osmotherapy: Use Among Neurointensivists|journal=Neuro Critical Care|year=2011|volume=14|pages=222–228|pmid= 21153930|doi=10.1007/s12028-010-9477-4|issue=2[/tpl]

The Thomas A. Mathis Bridge and J. Stanley Tunney Bridge are a pair of bridges that span  Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey, connecting Route 37 in Toms River with Pelican Island and communities along the Jersey Shore on the Barnegat Peninsula. The bridges pass through Toms River Township and a small piece of Berkeley Township, before ending at Route 35 in Seaside Heights.
The Thomas A. Mathis Bridge was completed in 1950 to replace a narrow wooden bridge that had served as the only connection between the mainland and the shore.  It is a bascule bridge that allows ship traffic to pass under the bridge when it is raised.
The J. Stanley Tunney Bridge was completed in 1972 to carry westbound traffic, while the Mathis bridge was dedicated for vehicles traveling eastbound.  The Tunney Bridge is a high level girder bridge that was designed to allow tall ships to pass under it without requiring a bridge opening. Although both bridges have three lanes, those on the Tunney Bridge are wider. Because Route 37 is one of a few links to the barrier island beaches, the bridge and the entire highway are routinely jammed with both local and tourist traffic throughout the summer months.
As of November 1, 2012, the Mathis Bridge was deemed to have sustained damage to the bridge bearings and will have to be repaired following the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy which hit the eastern seaboard on October 29, 2012.
Both spans have been deemed safe for operation by the DOT despite many rumors to the contrary.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Catalonia, Lists of rivers

The rivers of Catalonia can be classified into four groups according to their source.
The Llobregat deserves a special mention because of its importance: its basin covers most of the province of Barcelona. It source is in the pyreneean Serra del Cadí in the municipality of Castellar de n'Hug (Berguedà) and its valley is one the main north-south communication routes in Catalonia.
The Aran Valley is the upper valley of the Garonne (la Garona in Catalan, era Garona in Aranese), an Atlanic river which meets the sea near Bordeaux, France. The boundaries of the comarca do not correspond exactly with the watershed, and both the Noguera Ribagorçana and the Noguera Pallaresa have their sources on its territory.
The frontier between Catalonia and the Valencian Community is formed for much of its length by the Sénia, while the Noguera Ribagorçana forms the frontier with Aragon for much of its length.

CATEGORIES: Basic meteorological concepts and phenomena, Military technology, Oceanography

Military meteorology is meteorology applied to military purposes, by armed forces or other agencies. It is one of the most common fields of employment for meteorologists. 
World War II brought great advances in meteorology as large-scale military land, sea, and air campaigns were highly dependent on weather, particularly forecasts provided by the Royal Navy, Met Office and USAAF for the Normandy landing and strategic bombing.  
University meteorology departments grew rapidly as the military services sent cadets to be trained as weather officers. Wartime technological developments such as radar also proved to be valuable meteorological observing systems. More recently, the use of satellites in space has contributed extensively to military meteorology.
Military meteorologists currently operate with a wide variety of military units, from aircraft carriers to special forces.

The Liberal League ([tpl]lang-lb|Liberal Liga[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fr|Ligue Libérale[/tpl], [tpl]lang-de|Liberalen Liga[/tpl]) was a political party in Luxembourg between 1904 and 1925.  It was the indirect predecessor of the Democratic Party (DP), which has been one of the three major parties in Luxembourg since the Second World War.
For the first decade of its existence, the Liberal League maintained the liberal dominance under Prime Minister Paul Eyschen.  In 1908, they formed an alliance with the Socialists, leading to confrontations with the Party of the Right over secularism.  During the First World War, the party lost much of its advantage, and was replaced as the dominant party by the Party of the Right.  In the early 1920s, riven by rivalries between its classical liberal and progressive wings, the party collapsed.

German submarine ''U-10 was a Type IIB U-boat built before World War II for service in Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine''. As she was one of the first batch of boats built following the renunciation of the Treaty of Versailles, she was only capable of coastal and short cruising work. This led to her being reassigned to training duties after the Norwegian campaign of 1940 together with many of her sister boats.
During the war U-10 sank two vessels:
After almost five years she was stricken on 1 August 1944 at Danzig (now Gdańsk) and broken up.

A children's message or children's sermon is a part of a church service dedicated to communicating an abbreviated Christian message that is palatable to small children. It might be thought of as a mini-sermon for children.
Children's messages are common part of the liturgy in Reformed Protestant and other churches prior to the children being dismissed to go to Sunday School (or Children's church). The message may be given by the pastor or a lay leader (such as the superintendent of Christian education). For a typical message, the children are asked to gather at the chancel steps and face the pews. The pastor may have some sort of object or tactile teaching aid to focus the children's attention on the topic. The sermon typically lasts two to three minutes and may end in a brief prayer. 
Children's messages are often related to the main sermon and may prepare the congregation for it.

[[The Sanctuary Lamp]]

CATEGORIES: 1975 plays, Plays by Tom Murphy

The Sanctuary Lamp is a play by Irish playwright Tom Murphy written in 1975 but revised for subsequent productions. When premiered at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin its anti-Catholic stance caused enormous controversy with its author denounced in pulpits up and down the country. Defenders included the then President of Ireland who argued that the play was, along with The Playboy of the Western World and Juno and the Paycock, one of the greatest of Irish dramas. The trauma of the play's rejection caused Murphy to withdraw from playwriting altogether for a few years. When it was revived in a substantially rewritten version at the Abbey in 2001 and then at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester in 2003 it was re-evaluated as one of Murphy's best plays and was enormously successful with audiences.  A production of The Sanctuary Lamp received its London premiere in London at the Arcola Theatre in Dalston, between 10 March - 3 April 2010 in a production directed by Tom Murphy himself.

The setting is an alternate near-future Tokyo called "Tokyo NOVA", after a pole shift. Tokyo NOVA is a dangerous and attractive city.
Playing cards are used instead of dice in the Tokyo NOVA system. It is possible to perform a heroic action based on the player's selection instead of the capricious dice. The game is similar to Castle Falkenstein, which Tokyo NOVA predates by a year. The suits of cards correspond to four abilities: Spade (♠) is reason, club (♣) is passion, heart (♥) is life, and diamond (♦) is mundaneness.
The styles that correspond to character classes represent not only the abilities and occupations of the characters but also ways of life. For example, the Kugutsu (Japanese for puppet) style represents not only the job of a megacorp's employee but also the character's unshakable loyalty to the company.

CATEGORIES: Swedish male singers, Swedish opera singers, Operatic tenors, Litteris et Artibus recipients, Singers from Stockholm, 1943 births, 2002 deaths, Österreichischer Kammersänger

Gösta Winbergh (December 30, 1943 – March 18, 2002) was a Swedish tenor.
Winbergh was born in Stockholm. He is considered as among Sweden's and the world's finest tenors, included with Jussi Björling and Nicolai Gedda. 
There was no musical tradition in Winbergh's family. He himself was a building engineer when he watched his first opera performance in 1967; the experience so moved him that he decided on an operatic career. Accordingly he applied for the opera class at Sweden's prestigious Royal Academy of Music, and was admitted on his first attempt.  He trained at the school between 1969-71. He began singing at the Royal Opera in Stockholm, and gradually began to receive international attention in the 1980s when he guest performed on stages abroad. Copenhagen, Aix-en-Provence, San Francisco and in 1980, Glyndebourne, where he sang Belmonte, scoring a great success for his honeyed voice and elegant singing. He later worked several times at the opera house in Zürich and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. His leading performances in Mozart's Don Giovanni, Wagner's Lohengrin, Verdi's Rigoletto and Puccini's Turandot were particularly well received and celebrated.
For the first two-thirds of his 30-year career, Gosta Winbergh was greatly admired as a singer of Mozart's operas. His Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni was applauded at the Metropolitan, New York, at the Salzburg Festival, in Houston and Chicago, Berlin and Barcelona. He sang Ferrando in Cosi fan tutte at the Drottninghom Court Theatre and Tamino in The Magic Flute for his debut at La Scala, Milan. Other Mozart roles in his repertory were Idomeneo, Mitridate and Titus.
He also sang lyric roles such as Almaviva in Il barbiere di Siviglia, the Duke in Rigoletto, Alfredo in La traviata, Nemorino in L'elisir d'amore and Lenski in Eugene Onegin. Then in 1991 at Zurich he sang his first Lohengrin, and a whole new career opened out before him, with further exploration of Wagner, the Emperor in Die Frau ohne Schatten, Don Jose in Carmen and Florestan in Fidelio.
In 1982 Winbergh made his Chicago debut as Ferrando, and his Covent Garden debut in the title role of La Clemenza di Tito, which was also much admired. The following year he sang the title role of Mitridate, re di Ponto at the Schwetzingen Festival, and made his Metropolitan debut as Don Ottavio. In 1984 he sang Tamino in Salzburg and Ferrando at Drottningholm, as well as Admetus in Gluck's Alceste in Geneva. In 1985, he performed as a soloist in Mozart's Coronation Mass at the Vatican for the Pope. He made his debut at La Scala in 1985 as well, singing Tamino, and returned there in 1990 for the title role of Idomeneo, repeating the role at Madrid the following year. 
The year 1991 also found the tenor singing Jenik in The Bartered Bride in Bonn and returning to La Scala as Pylades in Gluck's Iphigénie en Tauride. However, the most important event for Winbergh that year was his first Lohengrin, in Zurich. Wisely not attempting a special Wagnerian style, he sang the role as if it were by Mozart, and the result was unbelievably beautiful. He repeated Lohengrin in Houston and Barcelona in 1992, and in May 1993 in Berlin he sang another new Wagner role, Walther in Die Meistersinger, which he brought to Covent Garden in October.  
After the Emperor in Die Frau ohne Schatten in Zurich in 1994, Parsifal in Stockholm and Erik in Der fliegende Hollander at Venice in 1995, Winbergh introduced his Lohengrin to Rome and Paris Bastille (a concert performance because the stage hands were on strike) in 1996; he then came back to Covent Garden in 1997 with both Lohengrin and Walther. He had completely assimilated both roles by now and, with superb diction allied to his lovely tone and fine phrasing, the performances were highly enjoyable. In 1997 he also sang Erik in San Francisco.
Huon in Weber's Oberon provided a new role in Zurich in 1998, when he also sang Parsifal in Berlin. In 1999 he appeared as Lohengrin in St Petersburg as a guest with the Kirov Opera, sang Walther in Chicago and returned to Stockholm for Don Jose in Carmen. His last new role was Florestan in Fidelio, which he sang at the Vienna State Opera the night before he died. Winbergh was also nominated for several US Grammy awards during his career.
Winbergh suffered a heart-attack and died in Vienna in 2002, where he was performing at the time. To honour his memory and opera work The Gösta Winbergh Award (GWA) was instituted in Sweden after his death: the award is each year handed out to young aspiring tenors through an arranged singing contest that takes place at the opera stage Confidencen, at the Ulriksdal Royal Estate (a few miles outside Stockholm). The first prize consists of 14.000 euro and the second prize of 6.000 euro.

Hong Kong Cantonese (Hong Kong Cantonese Chinese; [tpl]zh|t=香港粵語/港式粵語/香港廣東話/香港廣州話[/tpl]) is a form of Yue Chinese commonly spoken in Hong Kong. Although The Hong Kong Chinese largely identify this variant of Chinese with the term "Cantonese" ([tpl]lang|zh-hk|廣東話[/tpl]), a variety of publications in Mainland China describe the variant as Hong Kong speech ([tpl]lang|zh-hk|香港話[/tpl]). There are slight differences between the pronunciation used in Hong Kong Cantonese and that of the Cantonese spoken in the neighbouring Chinese province of Guangdong, where Cantonese (based on the Guangzhou dialect) is a lingua franca. Over the years, Hong Kong Cantonese has also absorbed foreign terms and developed a large set of Hong Kong-specific terms. These differences from the Canton norm are the result of British rule between 1841 and 1997, as well as the closure of the Hong Kong-China border immediately after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

CATEGORIES: Protein targeting

A protein signal patch contains information to send a given protein to the indicated location in the cell. It is made up of amino acid residues that are distant to one another in the primary sequence, but come close to each other in the tertiary structure of the folded protein (see red patch in the diagram). Signal patches, unlike some signal sequences, are not cleaved from the mature protein after sorting. They are very difficult to predict. Nuclear localization signals are often signal patches although signal sequences also exist. They are found on proteins destined for the nucleus and enable their selective transport from the cytosol into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complexes.

[[Team penning]]

CATEGORIES: Equestrian team sports, Western-style riding

Team penning is a western equestrian sport that evolved from the common ranch work of separating cattle into pens for branding, doctoring, or transport.
Today it is a fast-paced event that gives a team of three riders on horseback from 60 to 90 seconds (depending on the class or the sanctioning of the event) to separate three specifically identified cattle from a herd of 30, and put them into a 16' x 24' pen through a 10' opening, at the opposite end of the arena.Team Penning Retrieved on 4 May 2009
The sport features 30 head of cattle, typically yearling beef cattle (mature cows or bulls are not allowed), with numbers affixed to their back, three each wearing a number from 0 through 9 or with colored collars attached.  Timing starts once the line judge has dropped his flag as the lead rider's horse crosses the foul line.  At that time, the announcer identifies the cattle to be separated by calling out a randomly drawn number or collar color. The riders must cut out the three head that have been nominated, take them to the opposite end of the arena, pen them and call for time.
Teamwork is the key with all three riders working in harmony to cut out the correct cattle and drive them to the pen while keeping the rest of the herd (sometimes called trash or dirty cattle) back.
The history of the sport is thought to date back to 1942 when brothers Ray and Joe Yanez, along with Canadian cowboy Bill Schwindt were sorting steers from a herd of cattle on a Ventura County, California ranch. During a lunch break the trio reportedly came upon the idea of organizing what were routine cowboy chores into a competitive sport, one in which cowboys could showcase their horsemanship.The First Team Penning, article from Western Horseman, September 1997, accessed online March 5, 2007.  The first organized competition is thought to have taken place at the Ventura County Fair in August 1949.  
Today, the sport is a fast-growing western horse sport in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe.  In North America, the primary team penning sanctioning organization is the United States Team Penning Association (USTPA), headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.  There are an estimated 93,000 active team penners in North America.

Cambus is a public transport bus system, primarily serving the University of Iowa campus in Iowa City, IA. The service is intended to provide transportation for students, faculty, and staff around the main campus, University of Iowa Research Park, residence halls, and commuter parking lots. Cambus is a no fare service open to the general public. Cambus provides approximately 4,500,000 rides per year.
The service is operated by the Department of Parking and Transportation for the University of Iowa with funding from the Parking & Transportation Department, a UI Student fee, and the Federal Transportation Administration. 
Cambus was originally founded by University of Iowa students and has been in operation since 1972. The University of Iowa campus is divided into east and west halves by the Iowa River. Most Liberal Arts and Sciences classes take place on the east side of the river; thus the purpose of the new bus service was to facilitate easier transportation between the west-side dormitories and the east-side classrooms. At first there was no name for this service, so the founding students created a contest open to all U of I students to select one. "Cambus" was the name eventually chosen after Cambuskenneth, and the winner (whose name has been lost to history) was awarded a free pizza.
The first Cambus buses were used school buses, repainted by Cambus employees. There were three different bus routes; Red Route, Blue Route, and the Interdorm Shuttle. Cambus also acquired a trailer, which was used as their main office; this was located in the Hancher Auditorium parking lot.
Currently, Cambus employs approximately 170 employees. There are only six non-student employees who work specifically for Cambus: the Cambus Manager, the Maintenance Supervisor, and four full-time mechanics. All other employees, including drivers, dispatchers, trainers, student mechanics, and departmental supervisors, are students currently enrolled at the University of Iowa. 
Cambus also has two different buildings on the University of Iowa campus. The main office is located on Evashevski Drive, north Kinnick Stadium, called the West Campus Transportation Center.  Cambus moved operations to this newer building, shared with the greater Parking & Transportation department, on November 16, 2012. The Cambus Maintenance Facility, often called "The Barn" by employees, is located on South Madison Street south of the Campus Recreation and Wellness Center.

Its seat was Gkoritsa, which now has no such status.
Both before the Kallikratis law and after it, Therapnes was composed of the same eight Local Communities (topiki koinotita), the lowest level of the hierarchy: Agioi Anargyroi (formerly Zouraina), Agrianoi, Gkoritsa, Kallonē, Kefalas, Platana, Skoura and Chrysafoi. The population for the 2001 census can therefore be transferred from the old to the new system without loss of accuracy, but that of Sparti, which has different Municipal Units under the new system, cannot be.

[[Acoustic guitar]]

CATEGORIES: Acoustic guitars, Rhythm section

An acoustic guitar is a guitar that uses only acoustic (as opposed to electronic) means to transmit the strings' vibrational energy to the air in order to produce a sound. This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to amplify the vibrations of the string.
The source of sound in an acoustic guitar is the string, which is plucked with the fingers or with a plectrum. The string vibrates at a fundamental frequency but also creates many harmonics at different frequencies. The frequencies produced depend on string length, mass, and tension. The string causes the soundboard and sound box to vibrate, and as these have their own resonances at certain frequencies, they amplify some string harmonics more strongly than others, hence affecting the timbre produced by the instrument.

Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV), also referred to as Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV), determines flow velocity across a plane by measuring the Doppler shift in frequency of light scattered by particles contained in the flow.  The Doppler shift, Δfd, is related to the fluid velocity. 
The relatively small frequency shift (order 1 GHz) is discriminated using an atomic or molecular vapor filter.  This approach is conceptually similar to what is now known as Filtered Rayleigh Scattering (Miles and Lempert, 1990).

[[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]]

CATEGORIES: Education in Somerset County, Maine, Skowhegan, Maine

The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture is a nine week summer artists residency located in Skowhegan, Maine.  The school was established in 1947 by Willard W. Cummings, Sidney Simon, Henry Varnum Poor and Charles Cutler.  The vision of these founding artists was to create an enduring community of artistic practice, learning and innovation governed by artists.
The school invites applicants to submit images of artwork, which are then judged by a jury of school governors and artists.  During the summer work period, artists are given studios and living accommodations.  Sixty-five participants are accepted each year, and are supported by a staff of twenty.  A fee of approximately $5000 is asked of the applicants, but scholarships and awards reduce the average paid significantly.  More than half of the participants received full scholarships, and only a handful pay the full fee.
Six established artists are resident on the campus, giving studio visits and criticism to the participants.  Additionally, six or seven more established artists will come for week-long visits, meeting with the students and giving more lectures.  Lectures are the 
only part of the program open to the public.
The School is unique in that it is one of the few institutions in the United States that teaches the technique of fresco.  In addition to teaching fresco, the school has a permanent collection of fresco work done by important contemporary artists.  Since 2010, N. Sean Glover has been the fresco instructor.
Even though the school offers instruction in the traditional art of fresco, it is not focused on 'traditional' art forms.  The participants are of a thoroughly contemporary bent; video art, computer art, sculpture, painting and everything in between can be found.  The school has an up-to-date computer lab, photographic printing facilities, and a sculpture shop.

Petrolifera’s production base stems from its 100 percent-owned Puesto Morales/Rinconada Concession in the Neuquen Basin, Argentina. In late 2005 and early 2006, several significant light oil discoveries were made on this concession.
Petrolifera was also successful in negotiating two major petroleum and natural gas exploratory licenses covering over five million acres (20,000 km²) in the Marañon and Ucayali Basins of Peru during 2005. These blocks are either on trend with or offset significant petroleum accumulations and are considered to be well-situated from a geological perspective.
Petrolifera is currently 31 percent owned and also managed by Connacher Oil and Gas ([tpl]tsx2|CLL[/tpl]) of Calgary, Alberta.

HFC-245fa is also known as pentafluoropropane and by its chemical name 1,1,1,3,3,-pentafluoropropane.  Unlike CFC and HCFC blowing agents formerly used for this purpose, it has no ozone depletion potential and is nearly non-toxic.  Although it is intended to remain trapped within the foam insulation, it is practically non biodegradable with a lifetime of 7.2 years when it eventually does escape into the atmosphere.[tpl]citation|publisher=Honeywell|title=HFC-245fa- Product Stewardship Summary|date=December 2007|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/common/documents/Public-Ris-Summary-HFC-245fa.pdf|accessdate=May 13, 2012[/tpl]  It does have a high global warming potential of 950 (950 times the global warming effect of [tpl]CO2[/tpl]).[tpl]citation|title=Other Gases: Hydrofluorocarbons, Perfluorocarbons, and Sulfur Hexafluoride|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=May 13, 2012|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/archive/gg03rpt/other_gases.html[/tpl][tpl]citation|publisher=European Centre for Ecotoxicology|title=JACC 044 : 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) (CAS No. 460-73-1)|date=June 2004| url=http://www.ecetoc.org/index.php?mact=MCSoap,cntnt01,details,0&cntnt01document_id=114&cntnt01returnid=91|accessdate=May 13, 2012[/tpl]  Honeywell refers to this as "acceptable" in their literature, but they don't include the actual number.
AlliedSignal, who adopted the Honeywell name after acquiring it, decided in 1999 to provide a non ozone depleting blowing agent as an alternative for dichlorofluoroethane (HCFC-141b) and trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11).  Competitors Atofina and General Electric pursued strategies using other agents.  One of the disadvantages of R-245fa is its cost.

CATEGORIES: Amusement rides, Upside-down amusement rides

Super Star is a fairground ride once manufactured by Northern Amusements (NA Superides) now by Superides International in the UK.http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/rides/looping1.html[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Carol and David Ward of Northern Amusements, already a well experienced company due to their family’s single-handed development of the Meteorite into the UK. Spring 1996 saw the sketches of their proposed Super Star, and the Autumn of the year saw a ride debut for Patrick Burton. The ride features a different approach to obtaining the looping and spinning motions, lifting a single boom arm which then twists around its own axle, lifting a spinning frame of 8 main arms with a 4-person seat gondolas  In the rear of the gondola there is a hydraulic ram which pulls the seating units into an outward position. Once in this position the riders will be at a 90 degree angle when the ride is lifted to its 45 degree position. A safety system will then engage at the bottom of the ride to prevent the gondola from coming down in the event of an emergency.
When the ride is in its elevated position, the operator has the choice of rotating the main boom clockwise, or anti-clockwise. On some Super Stars, the boom can be lowered while the ride is in the fully inverted position. This form of operation is only used on one Super Star worldwide. The ride is packed onto one semi-trailer and has a fairly quick build-up time.
Super Star rides are capable of having a complete back-flash fitted with airbrushed artwork and neon lighting. 
The Super Star is loosely related to the Move-It.

Malta Story is a 1953 British war film, directed by Brian Desmond Hurst, which is based on the heroic air defence of Malta during the Siege of Malta in the Second World War. The film uses real and unique footage of the locations at which the battles were fought and includes a love story between a RAF pilot  and a Maltese girl, as well as the anticipated execution of her brother, caught as an Italian spy. The character of "Peter Ross" is apparently loosely based on that of Adrian Warburton.

PA 352 is a four- to five-lane road between Brookhaven and US 1, otherwise it is generally a two-lane road. The route intersects Interstate 95 (I-95) in Chester and US 1 near Lima at interchanges. PA 352 was first designated by 1928 to run between its current termini. A portion of the route between Brookhaven and US 1 was realigned to a straighter alignment in the 1950s. By 1980, PA 352 was realigned to a short concurrency with PA 3 to avoid intersecting it at a sharp angle.

CATEGORIES: Geography of Varna Province, Rock formations, Landforms of Bulgaria, 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria, Visitor attractions in Varna Province, Protected areas of Bulgaria

Pobiti Kamani ([tpl]lang-bg|Побити камъни[/tpl]) is a rock phenomenon located in Varna Province, Bulgaria, on the road between Varna and Sofia around several villages just west of Varna. It consists of several groups of natural rock formations on a total area of 7 km². The formations are mainly stone columns between 5 and 7 metres high and from 0.3 to 3 metres thick. The columns do not have solid foundations, but are instead hollow and filled with sand, and look like they are stuck into the surrounding sands, which gives the phenomenon its name.
In order to be preserved, Pobiti Kamani was designated a natural landmark in 1937.
There are a number of theories regarding the phenomenon's origin, divided roughly into two groups — supporting an organic or a mineral origin. According to the former, the formations are the result of coral activity, while the latter explain the phenomenon with the prismatic weathering of the rocks, the formation of sand and limestone concretions, or lower Eocene bubbling reefs. 
Based on field observations and a petrographic and stable isotope geochemical study, evidence now exists that these structures represent an exceptionally well exposed paleo-hydrocarbon seep system (strongly depleted carbon isotope signatures of the dominant low magnesium calcite cement). The dynamic reconstruction of the origin of these structures, the processes of fluid migration and possible microbial interference in the process of carbonate precipitation are presently under study by researchers from the Catholic University of Leuven, in collaboration with researchers from the Institute of Oceanology, RCMG, the Geobiology Lab of the University of Goettingen and the University of Bologna.

[[Winter's Bane]]
CATEGORIES: American power metal musical groups, Heavy metal musical groups from Ohio, Musical groups established in 1990

Winters Bane are a heavy/power metal band, formed in 1990.
They have gone through extensive line-up changes throughout their history with only guitarist and sometime-vocalist Lou St. Paul featuring as an ever-present.
In their first incarnation with Tim "Ripper" Owens (who would later join Judas Priest and Iced Earth), they released the Heart of a Killer album in 1993, a concept piece based on the murderous exploits of a character called Judge Cohagen. This album was re-released in 2000 by Century Media Records as a 2-CD set, featuring a bootlegged live gig as a bonus disc.
After the departure of Owens, St. Paul took over the vocal duties for both the unreleased Season of Brutality and Girth, arguably Winters Bane's heaviest work to date.
Following the release of Girth, Winters Bane went into a period of semi-activity while searching for a full-time vocalist. By 2003, German Alexander Koch (ex-Spiral Tower, Powergod) was recruited and a demo was cut. Two years later St. Paul, Koch and veteran drummer Mark Cross entered the studio to record Redivivus, a full-length album released in 2006.Winters Bane metal news and guitar resources
After the release of the album, Koch and Cross were replaced by locally-based Jeff Zaigen and former touring drummer Jeff Curenton and there are plans for a sequel to Heart of a Killer to be released in 2007.BLABBERMOUTH.NET - WINTERS BANE To Debut New Lineup In February
Former members Tim Owens and Dennis Hayes would later form their own band, Beyond Fear, and they released their debut album in 2006. The next year, Hayes would also join Owens in Iced Earth as their new bassist.
As early as December 2007, it was rumored that due to Matt Barlow's reunion with Iced Earth (thus the booting of Tim Owens), Tim Owens would return to Winters Bane as its vocalist. These rumors were confirmed, as it was announced that talks of said reunion are under way. "If the right conditions are met," said guitarist Lou St. Paul, "we would put forth our best effort, making of course a 'killer' album, and do a major tour." The rumors also state this follow-up would be a direct sequel to Heart of a Killer.

[[Smynos]]
CATEGORIES: Populated places in Laconia

Smynos ([tpl]lang-el|Σμύνος[/tpl]) is a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality East Mani, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior [tpl]el icon[/tpl] Population 1,917 (2001).
It is located in the Mani Peninsula on the eastern slopes of Mt. Taygetos, and it is named after the river Smynos, that runs through it. The region is also known as Vardounia (and its villages as Vardounochoria), after the medieval Vardounia castle located in the area, now in ruins.
The seat of the municipality was in Agios Nikolaos. The most historic village of the municipal unit of Smynos is the mountainous village of Kastania. It has two towers (pirgi), in which its inhabitants used to defend themselves against the Ottomans. The village has two coffee shops and attracts tourists in the summer. The largest village in the municipality is Petrina, known for the high quality of its PDO olive oil.
The most prominent site in the municipal unit is the monastery of Panagia Giatrissa which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and worshipers every year. Other sites of interest include the Vasilitsa forest (on the path of the European walking route E4), and the network of canyons formed by river Smynos and its tributaries. Traditionally the municipality rarely received tourists, except for visitors to the monastery; in more recent years ecotourism has been on the rise.

[[Genigraphics]]
CATEGORIES: Computer graphics

The Genigraphics presentation graphics was derived from a flight simulator designed by General Electric for NASA in the late 1960s The Computed Images System & Services division (CISS, to become Genigraphics) of General Electric delivered the first presentation graphics system to Amoco Oil's corporate headquarters in 1973. It was named the 100 Series, and was based on DEC's PDP 11 series of mini computer systems.  The first Genigraphics systems(100 Series and 100A Series)used an array of buttons, dials, knobs and joysticks, along with a built in keyboard, as the means of user interface. The PDP-11/40 computer was housed in a tall cabinet and used random access magnetic tape drives(DECtape)for storing completed presentations. 
The graphics generator was capable of outputting 2,000 line resolution, suitable for film recording. Subsequent models (100B,C,D,D+ and D+/GVP) replaced the knobs and dials with an on screen, text based menu system, a graphics tablet and a pen. The pen/tablet combination gave way to a mouse like device in later models, and served to provide the interface with the graphics tools. User interaction with the computer for functions such as media initialization or modem to modem data transfer required a DECwriter serial terminal. In 1982, General Electric divested the Genigraphics division along with a host of other "non essential" business units (Genitext, Geniponics to name 2) and Genigraphics Corporation was born. Shortly after the divestiture, the headquarters of Genigraphics was moved from Liverpool, New York to Saddle Brook, New Jersey.  Major success followed as the company grew exponentially over the next few years selling both systems and slide creation services.  At its peak, Genigraphics Corporation employed roughly 300 people, had 24 offices world wide revenues upwards of $70 million annually.  An IPO was abruptly aborted in 1984 as the result of impending recession. The remainder of the 80's would see Genigraphics Corporation's fortunes rise and fall—a series of poorly executed mergers and acquisitions and the failure of a major initiative to develop the next generation of graphic processors drained the company's finances and distracted executives.  Ultimately, the company was simply unable to respond to the rapidly changing market with a sufficient PC based product.  In 1989 the systems business was sold off leaving the service bureau to continue operation under the name Genigraphics. Just prior to the sale of the hardware business, the service division partnered with Microsoft licensing their clipart library for use in the new PowerPoint product—which had been acquired by Microsoft a year or so earlier. In addition to the licensing agreement, Microsoft included a "Genigraphics Driver" enabling users to have their PowerPoint presentations output as full color 35mm slides by transferring film recorder ready files to the nearest Genigraphics location for imaging. 
Although in the long run, Genigraphics was a one hit wonder—their one hit created the entire computer presentation graphics industry and paved the way for companies like Microsoft, Adobe and Corel.
Genigraphics was also known for its line of film recorders, transferring digital images onto 35mm photographic film for slides as well as for movies such as "The Last Starfighter."  The computer generated scenes for that particular movie were calculated on a Cray X-MP computer, the ultimate computer at the time, and then rendered onto a Genigraphics film recorder.
As of 2006, Genigraphics is currently an imaging post-production printer service:
35mm Slide production on the Genigraphics system
To produce 35mm slides on the Genigraphics system, the operator created the slide information (bar chart, line graph, pie chart or graphics and background artwork) without actually viewing this on the screen. The slide would be created in full and then the screen was 'regenerated'. It took about a minute for the screen to regenerate and produce the visual representation of the slide. The textual and other non-graphic input was sent to the processor with a set of commands (x,y coordinates etc.). Vector artwork was generated by dropping a set of vertices on the screen using a pen, tablet and 'puck' (a three button box operated with the free hand). Whilst drawing your graphic by dropping the vertices on the screen, a pink wireframe with the vertices as small squared would show you where each plotted point would be. Fill colours and borders where then plotted to the finished vector. The background could be gradated from one colour to a second colour using 2000 lines to reproduce a very smooth graduation effect.
Once finished and saved to the floppy, a slide was then 'imaged' onto 35mm transparency via an electronic rostrum camera. A batch file on the VAX mini-computer would then send the images to the camera one at a time. It took about 2 minutes to produce a 2000 line resolution slide. It was also possible to mix traditional media (slide text photographed on a manual rostrum via litho film negatives) and the background 'double-exposed' over the text via the Genigraphics system. This saved time when slide presentations were in a hurry (as they usually were!).
I operated on one for about five years. They were superseded when cheap PC based slide systems came on the market. This made slides much cheaper to produce and sell. At the time in Ireland a single slide could be produced for about 15-20 pounds. A cheaper PC version could be produced for about 5 pounds and quickly caught up in terms of speed and quality.

[[Nucleotidase]]

CATEGORIES: EC 3.1.3, Chemical pathology

A nucleotidase is a hydrolytic enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a nucleotide into a nucleoside and a phosphate.  For example, it converts adenosine  monophosphate to adenosine, and guanosine monophosphate to guanosine.
Nucleotidases have an important function in digestion in that they break down consumed nucleic acids. 
They can be divided into two categories, based upon the end that is hydrolyzed: 
5'-Nucleotidases cleave off the phosphate from the 5' end of the sugar moiety. They can be classified into various kinds depending on their substrate preferences and subcellular localization. Membrane-bound 5'-nucleotidases display specificity toward adenosine monophosphates and are involved predominantly in the salvage of preformed nucleotides and in signal transduction cascades involving purinergic receptors. Soluble 5'-nucleotidases are all known to belong to the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of enzymes, which are two domain proteins characterised by a modified Rossman fold as the core and variable cap or hood. The soluble forms are further subclassified based on the criterion mentioned above. mdN and cdN are mitochondrial and cytosolic 5'-3'-pyrimidine nucleotidases. cN-I is a cytosolic nucleotidase(cN) characterized by its affinity toward AMP as its substrate.  cN-II is identified by its affinity toward either IMP or GMP or both. cN-III is a pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase. 5'-Nucleotidases are involved in varied functions like cell-cell communication, nucleic acid repair, purine salvage pathway for the synthesis of nucleotides, signal transduction, membrane transport, etc.

A graphite reactor is a nuclear reactor that uses carbon as a neutron moderator, which allows un-enriched uranium to be used as nuclear fuel. 
The very first artificial nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1, used graphite as moderator. Two graphite moderated reactors were involved in major accidents: An untested graphite annealing process contributed to the Windscale fire (but the graphite itself did not caught fire), and a graphite fire during the Chernobyl disaster contributed to the spread of radioactive material (but was not a cause of the accident itself).

The Thomas W. Lawson was a seven-masted, steel-hulled schooner originally planned for the Pacific trade, but then used primarily to haul coal and oil along the East Coast of the United States. Built in 1902, the ship holds the distinction of being the largest schooner and the largest pure sailing vessel (without an auxiliary engine) ever built. Larger sailing vessels with auxiliary engines for propulsion were the French France II  (1911) and German R. C. Rickmers  (1906), both five-masted barques.
The Thomas W. Lawson was destroyed off the uninhabited island of Annet, in the Isles of Scilly, in a storm on December 14, 1907, killing all but two of her eighteen crew including the pilot who was already aboard ship. Her cargo of 58,000 barrels of light paraffin oil caused a tremendous oil spill on the Isles, probably the first large oil spill from a ship in modern history.

Usually this process is done by using a special  CD/DVD inkjet printer. Inkjet printable DVD media offers a way to customize DVD-Rs. When inserted into a suitable inkjet printer, it will be capable of reproducing appropriate inkjet printer page output, including text and pictures.
Printing directly onto an inkjet printable DVD-R provides the following advantages over traditional labels:
Lower Cost:
Generally, it is more affordable to buy printable inkjet media than to buy both media and labels. While the printer might represent an additional expense, a printer is needed to print labels anyway, and a media-capable printer costs about the same as an inkjet printer.
User-friendly:
It is easier than placing labels on many discs, as most printers have easy-to-use disc alignment.
Safer:
Labels can peel and cause damages to drives and player mechanisms.  However, as the inkjet DVD surface is part of the media, drive damage is less likely, regardless of storage conditions. Inkjet DVD media is also safer in slot-loaded optical drives.
These DVDs were typically slightly higher priced than their standard counterparts but nowadays the prices are comparable.

CATEGORIES: Video game gameplay, Video game graphics

Wraparound, in video games, is a gameplay variation on the single-screen in which space is finite but unbounded; objects leaving one side of the screen immediately reappear on the opposite side, maintaining speed and trajectory. This is referred to as "wraparound", since the top and bottom of the screen wrap around to meet, as do the left and right sides (in mathematics, this is known as a Euclidean 2-torus).The medium of the video game, Mark J. P. Wolf, University of Texas Press, 2001, 203 pp, p. 56, ISBN 978-0-292-79150-3 at Google Books Some games wrap around in some directions but not others, such as games of the Civilization series that wrap around left to right, or east and west but the top and bottom remain edges representing the North and South Pole (in mathematics, this is known as a cylinder).
In some games such as Asteroids there is no boundary and objects can travel over any part of the screen edge and reappear on the other side. Others such as Pac-Man, Hungry Horace and some games in the Bomberman series, have stages with a boundary surrounding most of the playing area but have few paths connecting the left side to the right, or the top to the bottom, that characters can travel on.

[[SBB-CFF-FFS RABDe 8/16]]

CATEGORIES: Multiple units of Switzerland

The RABDe 8/16 are a consequential further development of the RABDe 12/12 multiple units used by the SBB-CFF-FFS. They were, like the RABDe 12/12, designed for quick acceleration in commuter traffic. But in contrast to the RABDe 12/12, they didn't reach this goal with a lot of motor power, but rather by having a lightweight aluminium construction. Four ordered prototypes were built, but already retired from service in 1997 and later scrapped. They are among the SBB-CFF-FFS vehicles with the shortest use period.
The trainsets originally had the numbers 1121-1124. Already during construction of the prototypes, the waggon floor bent "like a banana" - One of the reasons why they got the nickname "Chiquita". Another reason was their unique purple-yellow livery, captivating many railfans.
Starting 1976, the Chiquitas where used on the right-hand waterside of the Lake of Zurich. Due to massive problems mainly with the door controllers, which didn't work correctly because of the flexing floors, they were later used mainly on spur lines in north-eastern Switzerland (Kreis III). Despite being rarely used due to the problems, two trainsets (2001 and 2003) were rebuilt in 1990 and 1991, respectively, and got, among other things, a new NPZ-like livery. In 1992, all four units were defective. Instead of undergoing another revision, they were put on sidings in Glarus and were not used any more. In 1993, a single trainset was rented to the Mittelthurgaubahn, whereupon the B car was removed. The AB car had to stay, because it contained some of the trainset's systems.

Annika Larsson (Stockholm, Sweden, 1972) is a contemporary artist living in New York. She received a Master of Fine Arts from the Royal University College of Fine Arts, Stockholm.
Since the late 1990s, Annika has produced a body of work in video often consisting of men in highly-charged scenarios. Presented with a surface banality or with implied or explicit violence,  and filmed in a sleek, polished style, without voiceover or dialogue, they are made up of slow gestures, dramatic camera angles and extreme close-ups. They create a subtle but palpable erotic tension.
In an interview with the Independent newspaper she said, "a cliché is something that we are supposed to see in a certain way. When you get close to it, it can have a new meaning - it is that twist I am interested in." http://www.annikalarsson.com/Independent.html
Critic Maura Reilly wrote in Art in America in 2004, "Larsson has consistently sought to expose masculinity as a performance, and to explore male power plays of domination and submission." http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_5_93/ai_n13717478
She has exhibited at prestigious art venues including the Venice Biennale and Art Basel, as well as having solo exhibitions at the ICA in London, the Andrea Rosen gallery New York.
She has had a long standing collaboration with Tobias Bernstrup and was director of photography on some performances by Vanessa Beecroft

It was first used as a stable block, but then converted to a theatre in 1753 when Queen Louisa Ulrika decorated it as one of her prime theatres: for twenty years, the scene was thereafter occupied by the Du Londel Troupe. It was one of a few chosen theatres maintained by the Swedish Royal Family, and used until her son's, king Gustav IIIs death in 1792. His majesty himself performed there as well as the great Swedish national poet and composer Carl Michael Bellman.
Confidencen is part of the Ulriksdal Palace estate, one of the five official residences of the Swedish Royal Family.
The opera stage is run by opera singer Kjerstin Dellert since the 1980s.

[[Theoretical philosophy]]
CATEGORIES: Philosophy, Philosophy education

The division of philosophy into a practical and a theoretical discipline has its origin in Aristotle's moral philosophy and natural philosophy categories. In Denmark, Finland, Poland, and Sweden courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately, and are separate degrees. Other countries may use a similar scheme—some Scottish universities, for example, divide philosophy into logic, metaphysics, and ethics—but in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject. There is also a unified philosophy subject in some Swedish universities, such as Södertörns Högskola.
Theoretical philosophy is sometimes confused with Analytic philosophy, but the latter is a philosophical movement, embracing certain ideas and methods but dealing with all philosophical subject matters, while the former is a way of sorting philosophical questions into two different categories in the context of a curriculum.

CATEGORIES: 1906 births, 1970 deaths, Brazilian people of Spanish descent, Brazilian actors

Oscarito (August 16, 1906 in Málaga, Spain - August 4, 1970 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) was the stage name of Brazilian actor and comedian Oscar Lorenzo Jacinto de la Imaculada Concepción Teresa Diaz. Oscarito was born to a family of circus comedians. His first film was Voz do Carnaval (1933), which also featured Carmen Miranda. He became a sought actor for chanchadas. He reached his ultimate fame with the comic duo he formed with fellow actor Grande Otelo in films directed by Carlos Manga. 
In the fifties and early sixties his movies were so famous that the lines to buy tickets, many times, extended for several blocks.
Oscarito was a very simple man. Even being the biggest Brazilian movie star at the time he didn't make a lot of money. At home he was funnier than in his roles, always joking, making faces, telling jokes. To visit with Oscarito was like watching a movie with no end.
He had a son, José Carlos (drum player) and a daughter, Mirian Thereza (actress and writer).
He loved Brazil, becoming a citizen as soon as he could. His favorite places in the world were Rio de Janeiro and São Lourenço, small town in the countryside of Minas Gerais, famous for its mineral waters.
Oscarito died of a heart attack, at home, whiles joking and making his family laugh as he always did.
Many of his movies were re-released in DVD. Among them: Carnaval Atlantida, Aviso aos Navegantes, O Homen do Sputnik, Matar ou Correr, De Vento em Poupa, Os Dois Ladroes, Esse Milhão e' Meu.

WLLS-LP was a low-power television station in Indiana, Pennsylvania, broadcasting locally on channels 49 and 65 as an affiliate of America One. The station was founded December 24, 1991 by Larry L. Schrecongost, who operated it until his death by heart attack in June 2010, when his widow, Nancy Schrencongost of Leland, North Carolina, assumed operations of the station. WLLS-LP was co-owned with radio stations WNCC and WRDD.
Originally classed as a low-powered repeater, WLLS-LP achieved Class-A status in early-2000, after the owner planned on including local and children's programming on its schedule.FCC: Comments of Larry L. Schrecongost, February 10, 2000. In February 2012, the station was warned by the FCC that they would be stripped of their Class-A status, after failing to file proper paperwork in relation to its children's programming since 2005.FCC: Letter to Nancy Schrencongost, March 28, 2012.
On April 17, 2012, the FCC cancelled the license of WLLS-LP, after determining that the lack of submitted paperwork equated to the station having gone dark for at least 21 months, placing the approximate closure date in July 2010.FCC: Notice of license cancellation (April 17, 2012) and Nancy Schrencongost's comments to the FCC (April 16, 2012). Prior to the cancellation, Mrs. Schrencongost e-mailed the FCC, stating that the agency failed to act on her requests to transfer the station from his estate to her name, and the status of the license hampered efforts to sell the station. She also complained that Verizon Wireless had taken away the channel 65 signal for "emergency services", which she dismissed as "nonsense". She also complained that the reception of WLLS-LP from a former Adelphia headend in Indiana with a coat hanger was disallowed by the FCC as tangible proof for must carry protections, and that plans in 2006 to relocate the digital signal of WNPA (now WPCW) to channel 49TV Technology: "WNPA-DT Move to Ch. 49 Approved; WLLS-CA Will Have to Change Channels", February 23, 2006 had also put the future of the station in doubt, an overture that Mrs. Schrencongost declared was "an illegal take-over". In closing to her letter, Mrs. Schrencongost said, "Please do not bother me again about silly FCC Forms. I don’t care what you do with WLLS-LP – which has been dark for 21 over months and is, consequently, a moot issue to begin with."

[[Christophoros Burgaris]]
CATEGORIES: 11th-century deaths, Byzantine generals, Catepans of Italy, 11th-century Byzantine people, 11th-century Italian people, Year of birth unknown

Christopher or Christophoros Burgaris was the short-tenured successor of the famous Basil Boiannes as catepan of Italy. The chronicler Lupus Protospatharius gives the date of Boiannes' departure as 1029, but modern historian Ferdinand Chalandon corrects this to 1027. This synchronises with the death of Guaimar III of Salerno, though other events associated with it are known to have occurred in 1028. Lupus, however, misplaces the election of Byzantius as archbishop of Bari, which occurred before 1025, in this year and therefore his whole chronology for the period seems to be in error, in our manuscripts at least. Christophoros saw the recommencement of the Saracen incursions. In 1027, Obbiano capitulated and Bari had to repel and assault. Christophoros was out of power by 1029. He was replaced by Pothos, under whom the Saracen attacks continued.

Bolaños was born in Marchena, Seville, and entered the Franciscan order while he was very young, studying until he became a deacon. Friar Alonso de San Buenaventura passed by his convent looking for missionaries to work in South America, and Bolaños joined his group. Twenty-two Franciscans departed from Spain in the 1572 expedition of the Adelantado Juan Ortiz de Zárate. They arrived in Asunción (the present-day capital of Paraguay) in 1575.
Bolaños was ordained a priest in 1585. For fifty more years he worked on the evangelization of the Guaraní aboriginals. He created the system of reductions, settlements populated by natives and overseen by the friars of the Order, of which the Jesuit Reductions would then become their most renowned examples. These towns "reduced" the originally nomadic natives to fixed, stable locations, allowing the missionaries to better control and catechize them, while teaching them to read and write, to cultivate the land, to domesticate animals, and to create manual artistic works. The Franciscan friar founded reductions all over the basin of the Paraná River, in Paraguay, large parts of Brazil, and the Argentine provinces of Misiones and northern Corrientes.
Bolaños also wrote the first grammar and lexicon of the Guaraní language, which were extremely useful for other missionaries. The Catechism approved by the Third Council of Lima in 1583 was translated by him, and the First Synod of Asunción (1603) dictated that it be employed to teach Christian doctrine to the natives. Bolaños did not only teach by himself, but also employed selected natives to teach others.
In 1607 he founded the city of Caazapá.
Near the end of his life, Bolaños retired to the convent of Saint Francis in Buenos Aires, where he died in 1629, at the age of 80.

Founded in 1998, Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health has rapidly developed into a nationally ranked, fully accredited public health research, service and training program.  The School is ranked by U.S. News and World Reports as a Top 25 Graduate School in Public Health, with the average age of Schools ranked above them 40+ years.  The school is also annually ranked among the top five schools of public health in student diversity.
The School provides an excellent forum for tomorrow's public health leaders to engage in a learning environment that builds on a wide array of research strengths and scholarly inquire of a stellar faculty (every year for the last six years a faculty member has received the prestigious designation of Regents Professor). Further, the research and practice links established by the faculty provide an extensive diversity of opportunities for students to work closely with professionals in applied public health settings. 
Students pursue degrees at both the master's and doctoral levels. The practice focused Master in Public Health (MPH) degree is offered in the five core disciplines of Public Health (Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Environmental and Occupational Health, Social and Behavioral Health, and Policy and Management) and in a unique Border Health program centered at our McAllen campus.  The research focused Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) degree is available in the five core disciplines as well.  The school offers what may be the nation's premier Master in Health Administration (MHA) program for those seeking career opportunities in rural settings, although our graduates can be found in many urban settings from Dallas and Houston, to New York City and Los Angeles.  The MHA program is one of only 10 nationally participating in the National Center for Health Care Leadership program designed to refine curricula by linking instructional objectives to practice-based competencies and was also recently ranked as a top program by U.S. News and World Reports. Doctoral programs are offered in Health Services Research (PhD), Social and Behavioral Sciences (DrPH) and Epidemiology and Environmental Health (DrPH).  We also have several collaborative programs in place (e.g., MD/MPH, 4+1 programs with pre-med, agriculture and the undergraduate health academy at Prairie View A&M University) or in development (e.g., MSN/MPH, PharmD/MPH).  SPH was competitively selected by the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School to provide training to military personnel in the Department of Preventive Health Services Principles in the Army Preventive Medicine program, a collaborative graduate program at Ft.

Curtis/Live! is Curtis Mayfield’s first live album, after leaving The Impressions. Originally released in May 1971 as a double LP on Mayfield's Curtom label (distributed through Neil Bogart's Buddah Records), the album's twelve tracks (track listing below is from the 2000 Rhino reissue, which includes two bonus tracks) — along with Mayfield's interstitial raps on the politics of the day — were recorded at Paul Colby's Bitter End nightclub in New York City. According to John Abbey, who at the beginning of the 1970s was editor of the UK magazine Blues & Soul, Mayfield and his band's first set at a Bitter End date in January 1971 comprised the bulk of the music presented here. Mixed primarily with Eddie Kramer at Electric Lady Studios, the album features Master Henry Gibson playing percussion, Craig McMullen on rhythm guitar, Joseph "Lucky" Scott on bass, and Tyrone McCullen on drums.

[[Fort Wayne Flames]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct indoor soccer clubs in the United States, National Professional Soccer League (1984–2001) teams, Sports in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Indiana soccer clubs, American Indoor Soccer Association teams, 1986 establishments in Indiana, 1989 disestablishments in the United States

The Fort Wayne Flames were an indoor soccer club based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, that competed in the American Indoor Soccer Association, playing home games at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum from 1986-1989.
The team was founded in by a group of four investors: Bob Britt, Fred Mathews, Jr., James Speed, and William Fahlsing and began play in the 1986-87 season of the American Indoor Soccer Association (AISA). The team reached out to experience by hiring away Pete Mahlock from the Louisville Thunder to be the team General Manager. Former Seattle Sounders (NASL), Cleveland Force (MISL), & Wichita Wings (MISL) goalkeeper and University of Washington coach Cliff Brown was brought in to be the first Head Coach of the franchise.
The inaugural season was one of struggle for the fledgling team. Just five games into the season, Brown was fired and replaced by defenseman Tom Alioto who continued his on field duties as a player/coach. As the team struggled on field, finishing last in the Southern Division with a 13-29 record, it also struggled off field. Despite finishing the season with the fourth-best attendance in the league, the season ended with the franchise having racked up huge losses that left the future in jeopardy.
The franchise would return for the 1987-88 season as remaining investors Mathews and Speed were joined by local businessman Craig Hartman, who with a huge influx of his own money, assumed the role as team President. Retaining Mahlock as GM, the team hired former three-time Indiana University All American, 1978 Hermann Trophy winner, NASL player, and United States Olympian Angelo DiBernardo to become the third Head Coach of the franchise. Although the on field play improved under new leadership, the team suffered and incredible 10 one-goal losses (the rest of the league had 13 one-goal losses combined) en route to a 9-15 record and a last-place finish in the regular season. 
Abandoning a traditional playoff format, the AISA instituted a six-team, home-and-away, round robin “Challenge Cup” Series to crown the 1988 post-season champion. Living up the promise they showed in the regular season, the Flames became dominant during the Cup Series, outscoring their opponents 67-46 through the first 11 games and posting an 8-3 record. The final game of the “Challenge Cup” was scheduled for April 1, 1988, with the Flames playing host to the 1984-85 and 1985-86 AISA Champion Canton Invaders. With each team hosting an 8-3 record, the game would be winner-take-all for the Cup. In front of a sellout (and franchise record) crowd of 8,028, the Flames would fall behind early and stage a furious rally late, only to fall to the Invaders 5-4.
Despite gains in the regular season attendance and league-leading playoff attendance, the 1988 off-season was again troublesome for the franchise. Looking to stem the flow of red ink, Hartman restructured the Flames into the only registered not-for-profit sports franchise in the nation. The off-season saw an intense fund-raising operation that included GM Mahlock and players Alan Bodenstein and Bobby Poursanidis living atop a billboard in the heart of downtown to raise both team awareness and funding. The results were impressive as hundreds of fans purchased stock in the team and 27 prominent local business leaders invested in the team to make up the new Board of Directors.
When DiBernardo decided to leave coaching, the team turned to former MISL standout defenseman Dave MacKenzie to be the fourth Head Coach of the franchise. Entering the position as the (then) all-time leader in MISL games played and with a reputation as a hard-nosed, physical player, the team showed marked improvement under MacKenzie, but continued to struggle in close games. Looking to add some extra spark, MacKenzie became the second player/Coach of the franchise as he activated himself and played in 27 games. Despite improving to a .500 record (20-20) the team missed the playoffs by one game.
The team folded following the 1989 season. Under separate ownership, Fort Wayne was awarded an expansion franchise Indiana Kick, which lasted one additional season (1989-1990).

[[Share capital]]
CATEGORIES: Corporations law, Finance

Share capital or capital stock (US English)Glossary on Trade Financing Terms - S[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl] refers to the portion of a company's equity that has been obtained (or will be obtained) by trading stock to a shareholder for cash or an equivalent item of capital value. For example, a company can issue shares in exchange for computer servers, instead of purchasing the servers with cash.
The term has several meanings. In its narrow, classical sense, still commonly used in accounting, share capital comprises the nominal values of all shares issued (that is, the sum of their "par values"). In a wider sense, if the shares have no par value or the allocation price of shares is greater than their par value, the shares are said to be at a premium (called share premium, additional paid-in capital or paid-in capital in excess of par); in that case, the share capital can be said to be the sum of the aforementioned "nominal" share capital and the premium. In the modern law of shares, the "par value" concept has diminished in importance, and share capital can simply be defined as the sum of capital (cash or other assets) the company has received from investors for its shares.
Besides its meaning in accounting, described above, "share capital" may also be used to describe the number and types of shares that compose a company's share structure. For an example of the different meanings: a company might have an "outstanding share capital" of 500,000 shares (the "structure" usage); it has received for them a total of 2 million dollars, which in the balance sheet is the "share capital" (the accounting usage).
The legal aspects of share capital are mostly dealt with in a jurisdiction's corporate law system. An example of such an issue is that when a company allocates new shares, it must do so in a way that does not inequitably dilute existing shareholders.

Elaeagnus multiflora (Goumi, Gumi, Natsugumi, or Cherry silverberry), is a species of Elaeagnus native to China, Korea, and Japan.
Elaeagnus multiflora is a deciduous or semi-evergreen shrub or small tree growing to 2-8 m tall, with a trunk up to 30 cm diameter with dark brown bark. The shoots are densely covered in minute red-brown scales. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, 3-10 cm long and 2-5 cm broad, green above, and silvery to orange-brown below with dense small scales.
The flowers are solitary or in pairs in the leaf axils, fragrant, with a four-lobed pale yellowish-white corolla 1.5 cm long; flowering is in mid-spring. thumb|left|Fruits of Elaeagnus multiflora in mid Junethumb|left|180px|Japanese Elaeagnus multiflora var. hortensis, with cigarette for scale, photo on June 2008The fruit is round to oval drupe 1 cm long, silvery-scaled orange, ripening red dotted with silver or brown, pendulous on a 2-3 cm peduncle. When ripe in mid- to late summer, the fruit is juicy and edible, with a sweet but astringent taste somewhat similar to that of rhubarb. The skin of the fruit is thin and fragile, making it difficult to transport, thus reducing its viability as a food crop. 
As with other species in the genus Elaeagnus, E. multiflora plants are actinorhizal, growing in symbiosis with the actinobacterium Frankia in the soil. These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it available in usable form for the host plant, and indirectly for other nearby plants. This feature allows the plant to grow in poorer soils than it could otherwise.
Chinese people have traditionally considered Elaeagnus multiflora to be among a group of "nutraceuticals", or foods that are edible and have medicinal values.[tpl]cite book|author=MobileReference|year=2008|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Trees and Shrubs: An Essential Guide to Trees and Shrubs of the World|publisher=MobileReference.com|isbn=9781605014876|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=mZEhZMOFLiQC|[/tpl]

[[Practical philosophy]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy education

The division of philosophy into a practical philosophy and a theoretical discipline has its origin in Aristotle's moral philosophy and natural philosophy categories. In Sweden and Finland courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately, and are separate degrees. Other countries may use a similar scheme—some Scottish universities, for example, divide philosophy into logic, metaphysics, and ethics—but in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject. There is also a unified philosophy subject in some Swedish universities, such as Södertörns Högskola.
Practical Philosophy is also the use of philosophy and philosophical techniques in everyday life. This can take a number of forms including reflective practice, personal philosophical thinking and philosophical counselling.
Examples of practical philosophy subjects are:

Lindegren wrote the libretto for Karl-Birger Blomdahl's space opera Aniara among others. Between 1948 and 1950 he led the literary magazine Prisma, one of the most lavish and broad ever produced in Sweden, aiming to "gauge the state of the arts in the present".
His poetry books include mannen utan väg ("The Man Without a Way", title without capital M; 1942, a breakthrough work of its generation) and Vinteroffer ("Winter Sacrifice", 1954).

The Ducati 749 is a 90-degree L Twin Desmodromic valve actuated engine sport bike built by Ducati Motor Holding between 2003 and 2006.  Designed by Pierre Terblanche, the 749 was available as the 749, 749 Dark, 749S, and 749R. It shared many of its parts with the 999, with the exception of a slightly smaller 180/55 profile rear tire, smaller cylinders, and different cylinder heads, giving it a smaller displacement of 748 cc.  This smaller engine is higher revving and produces a lower peak horsepower than the larger engine used in the 999.  The 749S model, like the 999, incorporates features rarely found on production motorcycles, including adjustable rake (23.5° or 24.5°) and five-position adjustable rearset mounts.
A limited number of the 749 were manufactured as a race version — the 749R — each with their production number stamped on the triple clamp.  This race model was lighter, had a shorter stroke, increased bore and larger valves which allowed it to run more efficiently at higher RPM, and hence, produced more torque and power than the 749/S models.  The 749R also came with a larger fuel tank ([tpl]convert|18.3|L|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]); slipper clutch; Öhlins forks, shock and steering damper; racing cams; titanium valves, valve guides, and connecting rods; magnesium head covers, and carbon fiber belt covers.  Its 2004 model had carbon fiber fairings.
The 749 was replaced by the Ducati 848 for the 2008 model year.

[[Neutral buoyancy]]

CATEGORIES: Underwater diving procedures, Underwater diving physics, Density, Neutral buoyancy training

Neutral buoyancy is a condition in which a physical body's average density is equal to the density of the fluid in which it is immersed. The buoyancy offsets the force of gravity that would otherwise cause the object to sink (if the body's density is greater than the density of the fluid in which it is immersed) or rise (if it's less). An object that has neutral buoyancy will neither sink nor rise.
In scuba diving, the ability to maintain neutral buoyancy through controlled breathing accurate weighting and management of the buoyancy compensator is an important skill. A scuba diver maintains neutral buoyancy by continuous correction, usually by controlled breathing, as neutral buoyancy is an unstable condition for a compressible object in a liquid.

Alfred Kohlberg (San Francisco, California, 1887 – New York City, 7 April 1960) was an American textile importer and staunch anti-Communist—being a member of the called "China lobby", a close ally of Roman Catholic Republican Senator, (1946–1957),  for Wisconsin Joseph R. McCarthy,  a guide to former candy lollipops manufacturer Robert W. Welch Jr. and founding director of the staunch  right-wing activist John Birch Society.[tpl]cite conference|first=Robert E.|last=Herzstein|title=Alfred Kohlberg: Counter-Subversion in the Global Struggle against Communism, 1944-1960 | booktitle = Globalization, Empire, and Imperialism in Historical Perspective|date=2006-06-01|location=University of North Carolina|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5HqTqz3zF|accessdate=2006-08-02[/tpl]
Born in San Francisco, Kohlberg moved to New York and set up a business buying linen in Ireland that was then sent on to China, where his agents would hire thousands of poorly paid local weavers to turn the raw linen into fine textiles. These were then exported to the United States, where they were marketed and sold to wealthy consumers as high-priced luxury fabrics. This earned him significant profits and wealth. 
Due to his business interests he made many trips to China. During the course of one of these trips in 1943  after inspecting the progress of the Chinese war-effort, he became convinced him that the many stories in the American press of Chiang Kai-shek's corruption were false and were being spread by communist-sympathizers. Subsequently he founded a journal Plain Talk intended to rebut the claims made by the China Hands and support the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-Shek, thus becoming an influential member of the  China Lobby.
Kohlberg was also a sometime board member of the Institute of Pacific Relations, though he later claimed that it was infiltrated by communists.McCarran Committee testimony, April 16, 1952 He was the financial backer of Plain Talk, which merged with The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty,  published by the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) in 1950.
Kohlberg married Jane Myer in 1921 and had two daughters and two sons."NNDB"

[[Serinette]]
CATEGORIES: Organs (music), Mechanical musical instruments

A serinette is a type of mechanical musical instrument consisting of a small barrel organ. It appeared in the first half of the 18th century in eastern France, and was used to teach tunes to canaries. Its name is derived from the French serin, meaning “canary.”
Serinettes are housed in a wooden case, normally of walnut, and typically measuring 265 × 200 × 150 mm. The instrument is played by turning a crank mounted on the front. The crank pumps a bellows to supply air to the pipes, and also turns a wooden barrel by means of gears. Driven into the barrel are brass pins and staples with which the pieces of music are encoded. Mounted over the barrel is a bar carrying wooden keys connected to valves by vertical wooden rods. As the barrel turns, the pins and staples lift the keys, in turn opening the valves to let air into the pipes, which are located at the rear of the instrument. Tunes are selected by first lifting the bar carrying the keys, then shifting the barrel along its length. This brings a different set of pins and staples in line with the keys.
Most serinettes contain one rank of ten metal pipes at 2' pitch and play eight different tunes. Each tune lasts about 20 seconds and is normally of quick tempo and contains considerable ornamentation. A paper label pasted inside the lid listed the tunes available; one of the most common was “La petite chasse.”
Serinette construction was remarkably consistent; instruments built a hundred years apart by different makers can bear a strong similarity. Many builders worked in and around Mirecourt in the Lorraine region of France.
The sound of the serinette is similar to that of the piccolo.

[[Alan Nathan]]

CATEGORIES: Living people

Alan Nathan' is a centrist US radio talk show host and columnist.  He starts his shows with the mantra: "We want the Republicans out of our bedrooms, the Democrats out of our wallets, and both out of our First and Second Amendment rights!" and describes himself as, The Militant Moderate.  He has sometimes been labeled as libertarian.Townhall.com::Free Speech at Risk: A Free Congress Forum on the Fairness Doctrine ::By Paul Weyrich
Nathan's style is noted for its speed, skilled debate, and rigorous logic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
Nathan began his career in radio as a DJ at 1480 WPWC Radio in Dumfries, VA, and it was there where he aired his first talk show, Profile and Comment With Alan Nathan.  Soon after, he adapted this program to Public-access television and caught the attention of legendary columnist and then anchor personality, Jack Anderson.  Based on Mr. Anderson's experience as a guest on "Profile and Comment", Nathan was hired as a correspondent on the Financial News Network's "Insiders With Jack Anderson."
In 1998,  Nathan started "Spanking the Left and Right," a local show on WZHF 1390 AM in the Washington, D.C. market.  He was soon picked up by the Radio America Network and became the syndicated weekend host of "Battling The Left And Right."  In 2000, that show also became a daily program and was renamed "Battle Line with Alan Nathan."
Wanting to commit more time to his columns, Nathan decided that effective September 4, 2006, he would cease "Battle Line's" daily syndication but continue its long running syndicated weekend edition.
In 2010, however, he joined forces with Main Street Radio Network, as Vice President (overseeing programming and syndication), and continued hosting the long-running “Battle Line w/Alan Nathan."  In November 2012, distribution was moved to the Salem Radio Network.
In August 2013, Alan yielded to popular request and changed the name of his program from "Battle Line with Alan Nathan" to "The Alan Nathan Show." As quoted in All Access, “They’ve been calling it the ‘ALAN NATHAN SHOW’ for years, so I learned how to take a hint.  Additionally, while there’s plenty of spirited debate (or battling) happening on the program, it’s also a guest generated, panel driven event that teases all who take themselves too seriously.”  The Show is entering its 16th year of syndication, and is aired live MON-FRI (5-7pm) with many stations delay broadcasting (8-10pm and 2-4am overnight) //SAT (6-7pm) //SUN (3-4am) ET Main Street Radio Network
Talkers Magazine rated Nathan as one of the Top 100 Talk Hosts in America for 2002, 2003 and 2005.

[tpl]About|a town in Medak district||Narsapur (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Narsapur[/tpl]

Narsapur is one of the major towns in Medak district, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is located 60 km north of Hyderabad. The history of this town dates back to the Kakatiya reign. Although people of various religious backgrounds live in Narsapur town, they have embraced the Telangana culture.
Narsapur is a small town with greenery, surrounded by hills and thick forest. Earlier Narsapur was known for "Naxalites"; but more recently it has changed substantially because of modernization and development in AP, especially in areas surrounding Hyderabad. Narsapur has one of the largest village irrigation tanks (Rai Rao Cheruvu) in Medak District. Narsapur was chosen as one of the first locations to start use of the MNIC (Multi-Purpose National Identity Card) in India.
Narsapur Reserve Forest, the largest forest [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] in the suburbs of Greater Hyderabad, is spread between Gummadidala and Narsapur towns. This dense patch of forest spans 30 to 40 km². It has a mini-ghat section, thick forest with a variety of trees, shrubs, herbs (including medicinal plants), and grasses, several small lakes. The forest and irrigation tanks of this mandal support a range of wildlife (fauna include rhesus macaque, spotted deer, four-horned antelope, jackal, wild boar, leopard, rat snake, Russell's viper, peacock, and many other species of small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fish, crustaceans, insects, spiders, ...). In the past, the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad used this forest as the release site for monkeys captured in the city, and the approach road to Narsapur from Hyderabad is now often lined with troops of Rhesus Macaques begging for food from passing motorists. This forest is one of the regular venues for monthly Sunday field trips of the Birdwatchers Society of Andhra Pradesh (BSAP), which has records of bird observations from here dating back >30 years. Lately, the village has become a hotspot for trekking and Telugu film shootings. Films shot here include 'Ratri', 'Telangana', 'Adrustam', 'Chantigadu', 'Dee', 'A film by Aravind' and many more.
Narsapur is now known for the Padmasri Dr. B.V. Raju Institute of Technology, an engineering college. The college was started by the philanthropist Padmabhushan Dr. B. V. Raju garu. The college offers Post Graduate courses in Electronics and Chemical engineering streams. The college has also started to offer MCA.

[[Big Scrub]]

CATEGORIES: Visitor attractions in New South Wales, Forests of New South Wales

The Big Scrub was the largest area of subtropical lowland rainforest in eastern Australia. It was intensively cleared for agricultural use in the 19th century by colonists. Only a few remnants survived the clearing, with less than 1% now existing.
Located on the North Coast of New South Wales, between what is now the towns of Byron Bay (east)and Lismore (west), the core Big Scrub area consisted of an estimated 900 square kilometres of subtropical rainforest.
The Big Scrub existed in the Bundjalung Aboriginal Nation. Traditionally the Bundjalung (particularly those that spoke the Widgjabal language of the Bundjalung nation) traversed it via walking trails, and maintained a few grassed clearings for camping and hunting within the rainforest. Rainforest bushfood were a regular part of the traditional Bundjalung diet, including staples like Black Bean, Castanospermum australe, which is detoxified before eating.
The Big Scrub was dominated by White Booyong (Heritiera trifiolata) and Australian Red Cedar (Toona australis). The latter was eagerly sought by the 'cedar getters' for its fine quality timber. The cedar getters were the first non-indigenous people to exploit the Big Scrub area.
Later, the Government of New South Wales gave allotments to potential farmers on the basis that they cleared it of rainforest. Hence, most of the Big Scrub was cleared, and the surviving Bundjalung were placed into reservations.
In the 20th century, interest in rainforest and conservation resulted in a greater effort to conserve the few remaining remnants of the Big Scrub. The major remnants are: the Booyong Flora Reserve, Victoria Park Nature Reserve, Davis Scrub Nature Reserve, Boatharbour, and Hayters Hill Nature Reserve. These remnants have been subject to ecological restoration projects which involves the removal of invasive non-native weeds.
Big Scrub remnants have become a source of native foods for cropping, especially in recent years. These include the macadamia nut, riberry and Finger Lime.
Macadamia nut is now grown commercially over much of the former Big Scrub area, but the main species used in cropping, Macadamia integrifolia, did not naturally occur in the Big Scrub.

Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (Gotha, 28 November 1774 – Gotha, 11 February 1825), was the last duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.
He was the third but second surviving son of Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and Charlotte de Saxe-Meiningen.
After the death of his older brother August without sons (1822), Frederick (the only surviving male of the house) inherited the duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.
Frederick fought - after military training - in the Napoleonic campaigns and was heavily wounded. As a consequence of these injuries, he was constantly ill until his death. Because of his illness, he traveled for a long time seeking a cure.  During these stays outside of his duchy, he left the government in hands of his secret advisor Bernhard August von Lindenau.
He only reigned three years and died unmarried; with him, the line of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg ended. After his death, his lands were repartitioned among his Wettin relations. Ernst I of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld received Gotha, and changed his title to Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, although the two duchies remained technically separate.

At some point[tpl]when|date=October 2012[/tpl] SIAM took it over.
The prize is given every two years, alternately in two categories: (1) for a notable application of combinatorial theory; (2) for a notable contribution in another area of interest to George Pólya such as approximation theory, complex analysis, number theory, orthogonal polynomials, probability theory, or mathematical discovery and learning.
The prize is broadly intended to recognize specific recent work. Prize committees may occasionally consider an award for cumulative work, but such awards should be rare.

Arturo José Cruz Sequeira (born 1953) is the son of Nicaraguan politician Arturo Cruz. He became involved in the exile politics of the Contra rebels opposing the Sandinista (FSLN) government in the 1980s, and more recently served as the Ambassador of Nicaragua to the United States for two years from 2007 to 2009.[tpl]cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Nicaragua: His Excellency Arturo Jose Cruz Sequeira | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.washdiplomat.com/ambprof/nicaragua.html | work =The Washington Diplomat | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-06 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071017101923/http://washdiplomat.com/ambprof/nicaragua.html  |archivedate = 2007-10-17[/tpl] Prior to his ambassadorship, Cruz was a Tenured Professor at Instituto Centroamericano de Administración de Empresas Business School in Managua, Nicaragua, and a Visiting Professor at the Advanced School of Economics and Business in San Salvador, El Salvador. 
Cruz, Jr. is the child of Arturo José Cruz Porras and Consuelo Sequeira Ximénez, the firstborn of seven children. As an idealistic youth, Cruz supported the Sandinistas, only to become disillusioned after they took power. In 1982 he turned to the charismatic Edén Pastora, the former Sandinista commander starting up the rebel Democratic Revolutionary Alliance, only to become disenchanted with him as well. Cruz then became involved in 1985 with UNO (United Nicaraguan Opposition), the rebel umbrella group which his father had joined. Trips to Lt. Colonel Oliver North's office at the United States National Security Council brought him into contact with North's secretary, Fawn Hall, with whom he had a well-publicized relationship. After his father's resignation from UNO in March 1987, he attached himself to Aristides Sánchez. Eventually, Cruz left Contra politics, recounting his experience in Memoirs of a Counter-Revolutionary.
He is a graduate of American University in Washington, D.C., has a master's degree in international relations from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, and in the early 1990s he obtained a Doctorate in Modern History from the University of Oxford. On February 27, 2007 he presented his credentials as Nicaragua's Ambassador to the United States after being chosen for the post by recently elected President Daniel Ortega. He resigned his post in March 2009 and returned to his teaching position at INCAE. 
A former Bradley Fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC, Cruz’s academic focus has been the analysis of social, economic, and political trends in Latin America. His book Nicaragua’s Conservative Republic 1853-1893 was published by Palgrave Press and Saint Antony’s College in 2002. In 2003, the work was translated and published in Spanish by the Coleccion Cultural de Centro America. He is also the co-author of Varieties of Liberalism in Central America: Nation-States as Works in Progress (University of Texas Press, 2007) along with Forrest Colburn, of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  His  writings and articles on Latin America and the foreign policy of the United States have also appeared in such publications as the New Republic, Commentary, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and SAIS Review.

Their original name was Roy's Comrades, which was a nod to Roy McMurtry, Attorney General of Ontario at the time. After writing a few decent songs, the band decided to record and stay together.  In 1995, their song "12," from Thoughts of Aggression (Raw Energy 1994), was re-recorded at CBC Studios and released as an animated video by Sesame Park and subsequently picked up by Sesame Street where it aired internationally for almost a decade.  In 1998, the band performed live on CTV's Open Mike with Mike Bullard.  The band performs mainly in Ontario and Quebec but have toured Canada in past. They have performed with bands such as Ripcordz, Armed and Hammered, Dayglo Abortions, GBH, Agnostic Front, Bad Brains, Propagandhi, D.O.A., UK Subs, Bunchofuckingoofs, Coffin Break, and Submachine to name a few.  Their song "Undertaker", was featured in a 2008 Space (TV channel) documentary titled "Zombiemania".

[[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]]
CATEGORIES: Psychogeography

The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture (WNLA) was the name taken by a group of experimental artists and psychogeographers active in Britain (sections existed in both Glasgow and London) during the 1990s. Informed to a large degree by the urban practices of the Paris based Lettriste Internationale (1952–57), the workshop focused its practise on developing the lettrist theory of Unitary Urbanism through physical research and behavioural intervention; redefining the psychogeographical terrain of the cityscape in relation to its emotive resistivity. 
During the two year 'Psychogeographical Survey of Glasgow' (1992–94) the group concentrated its activity on refining the interplay between the Letterist (and later situationist) techniques of derive and constructed situation. The outcome of which, described in detail in the essay 'Programmed and constructed drifting; the event architectures of Unitary Urbanism' (Viscocity No.3 Glasgow, Jan 1994), highlighted the false separation between these two classic situationist tools and their indivisibility in practice. Borrowing initially from the constraint techniques of the Oulipo, whereby the pure flow of an otherwise unrestricted derive is directed in its apparent randomness (and given an element of control over its protagonists) by the application of parameters; these behavioural algorithms ranged from elaborate 'drifting machines', carried across the terrain and deployed at regular intervals to generate recursive instructions for movement (non-linear feedback loops) to the simple 'anywhere' hitchhiking sign, (a regular sight in the summer of 1993 being held aloft on the westbound pavement of the Great Western Road M8 bridge).
The artist Ralph Rumney (1934–2002), who had known many of the original Parisian letterists, participated in one of the groups derives in London in 1995 and is credited with bringing the activities of the workshop to a wider audience. While it had been assumed the workshop had disbanded shortly after the release of the fourth and final issue of its journal Viscocity, now infamous for having been selected by the K Foundation to announce their 23 year moratorium on all artistic practise, a reading of this journal suggests the moratorium applied to both the K Foundation and to WNLA itself, with the group committing to a total cessation of any and all mediation of their activities until 2018. 
British cultural commentator and activist Stewart Home became a champion of their ludic adventurism, including excerpts from the journal (and a tantalising taste of the type of works undertaken) in a series of edited collections published by Serpent's Tail. "The Joker, the incidental game of urban poker", was printed in Mind Invaders and describes a game of poker played between cities from playing cards found in the street. "St Andrews Arena" appeared in the collection Suspect Device and narrates one particular derive that took place in Glasgow in 1993. Other references to the workshop's activities have appeared in articles by Home, notably in the journal Variant.Home, Stewart. "There's no success like failure", Variant, Volume 2 Number 1 (Winter 1996), p18  Home, Stewart. "Mondo Mythopoesis", Variant, Volume 2 Number 2 (Spring 1997), p7

Urkun (in English: "Exodus") is the Kyrgyz name for a 1916 revolt against Russian Tsarist forces and a mass flight to escape to China.  The events occurred at the Bedel Pass border post near the Kyrgyz-Chinese border on July 30, 1916.
Accounts of the Kyrgyz death toll vary.  Some claim that nearly half the Kyrgyz from the northern part of the country died during Urkun. Bruce Pannier put the death toll at more than 100,000 people. Russian sources admit that the revolt claimed the lives of up to 3,000 people.Krugosvet Encyclopaedia. Article on Sturmer.
History professor Tynchtykbek Tchoroev, author of a book on Urkun, believes the cause of the revolt to have been the call for conscription issued by Boris Stürmer:
In the eastern part of Russian Turkestan, tens of thousands of surviving Kyrgyz and Kazakhs fled toward China. In the Tien-Shan Mountains they died by the thousands in mountain passes over 3000 meters high.

[[Rushbrooke]]

CATEGORIES: Towns and villages in County Cork, Cobh

Rushbrooke is an urban area on the western side of Cobh on Great Island in Cork Harbour, Ireland. It is in the townland of Ringacoltig ([tpl]Irish place name|Rinn an Chabaltaigh|headland of the navy[/tpl]).Placenames Database of Ireland
The area is named after Frederica Harriet Rushbrooke and her son and daughter who were granted lands under the 'Midleton Act' (1850). This followed the suicide of the 5th Viscount Midleton, George Alan Broderick (1806-1848), who died by inhaling charcoal on 1 November 1848. Succession to the titles and estate was court challenged and ultimately settled by Private Act of the House of Lords.
Land in Surrey and Ireland were settled on the Rushbrookes from the estates of Earl Broderick/Viscount Midleton, who became known as 'The most wretched man in the world' by his aristocratic peers in England.http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Surrey+Heritage+talks+and+tours?opendocument Much disapproved of was his association with Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, the renowned Catholic architect and father of E W Pugin who later designed Cobh Cathedral. Even more disapproved of was his unorthodox relationships.
Rushbrooke contains some of the most beautiful examples of Victorian houses in Ireland, and is rapidly becoming one of the most sought after housing locations in the Cork region. There is much regeneration underway of the heritage houses of Rushbrooke, many of which are now listed buildings.
Rushbrooke has the oldest tennis club in Ireland, namely the Rushbrooke Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. 
Rushbrooke has a long tradition of ship and boat-building. The docks at Rushbrooke were founded by Joseph Wheeler and became the home of the former Dutch-owned Verolme Cork Dockyard which once employed over 1,100 people in shipbuilding. Many large ships were built and launched from Verolme as well as a number of naval vessels for the Irish Naval Service which has its headquarters nearby. Unfortunately the yard closed in the mid 1980s with major job losses but in recent years the dockyard has been redeveloped into a commercial and small industries park, while Cork Dockyard Holdings Ltd. continues with ship and boat repair.
An array of housing estates are being built on the outskirts of the Rushbrooke area at present.

CATEGORIES: Accounting qualifications, Accounting in the United Kingdom

Chartered Certified Accountant (designatory letters ACCA or FCCA) was historically seen as a British qualified accountant designation awarded by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).  However, although ACCA is UK based, it is a global body for professional accountants with 147,000 qualified members and 424,000 students globally.  Support offices/centres exist in 83 countries.  http://www.accaglobal.com/
The term Chartered Certified Accountant was introduced in 1996.  Prior to that date, ACCA members were known as Certified Accountant.  It is still permissible for an ACCA member to use this term. Members of ACCA with post-qualification experience of more than five years and have completed the required continued professional development are designated Fellows, and use the designatory letters FCCA in place of ACCA.
The term Chartered refers to the Royal Charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.
Chartered Certified Accountants work in all fields of business and finance. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.
Since Chartered Certified Accountant is a legally protected term, individuals who describe themselves as such must be members of ACCA. If they carry out public practice engagements, they must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, being insured against any possible liability claims and submitting to inspections.

[[Double counting (fallacy)]]

CATEGORIES: Logical fallacies, Misuse of statistics

Double counting is a fallacy in which, when counting events or occurrences in probability or in other areas, a solution counts events two or more times, resulting in an erroneous number of events or occurrences which is higher than the true result. This results in the calculated sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes to be higher than 100%, which is impossible.
For example, what is the probability of seeing at least one 5 when throwing a pair of dice?  An erroneous argument goes as follows:  The first die shows a 5 with probability 1/6; the second die shows a 5 with probability 1/6; therefore the probability of seeing a 5 is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 = 12/36.  However, the correct answer is 11/36, because the erroneous argument has double-counted the event where both dice show 5s. The inclusion-exclusion principle can be used to compensate for double counting by subtracting those objects which were double counted.

Bruntsfield Hospital was an Edinburgh hospital which started in 1878 as a women's dispensary (out-patient clinic) opened by the city's first female doctor, Sophia Jex-Blake. It soon added some beds for in-patients, and moved from a busy, central area to the more peaceful Bruntsfield before the turn of the century. Its name from 1885, Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children, continued in formal use into the 1930s, but before 1920 it started to be known as the Bruntsfield Hospital. For a few years, another of Scotland's pioneering female doctors, Elsie Inglis, was a consultant there. In 1948 the hospital was absorbed into the National Health Service (NHS); it closed in 1989.

[[Opera Memphis]]

Opera Memphis is a Memphis, Tennessee non-profit arts organization chartered in 1956 by a group of Memphians interested in producing regional opera. Charter signatories included noted Memphians Philip Belz and Walter Chandler. Early productions consisted mainly of local singers and local directors. During this initial period the Metropolitan Opera Company toured regularly through the area and performed in Memphis two to three times per year. As the company grew, the performers and directors became more regional and the sets and costumes more professional. By the mid-1970s, Opera Memphis began bringing in well-known singers like Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Joan Sutherland, Sherrill Milnes, and Birgit Nilsson to perform in lead roles.
Opera Memphis is widely respected for its education and outreach programs, which currently reach over 25,000 children and adults per season.  From 1993-95, Opera Memphis was the recipient of an Arts Plus Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, which resulted in student written and produced operas at three Memphis City high schools. Current program offerings include the Artist-in-Residence Tour, Opera 101, Black Roots of Opera, Student Dress Rehearsals and Summer Conservatory.
In March 2004, Opera Memphis completed a very successful $7.3 million capital drive for the creation and construction of the Clark Opera Memphis Center in East Memphis, a 19,000 square foot administrative center, which includes a rehearsal hall, small performance space, costume shop and small props shop. The Clark Opera Memphis Center is a cultural center for the community, a meeting place for corporate leaders, and a facility that speaks for the arts through both our function and our architecture.
In December 2010, the Opera Memphis Board of Trust announced Ned Canty as the new Opera Memphis General Director.  Since his arrival Canty has made many significant changes including the creation of 30 Days of Opera and a restructuring of the regular season.  30 Days of Opera is a September/October series of pop-up opera presentations in public spaces throughout the region that offer free exposure to opera in what Canty has described as an effort to "create a trail of breadcrumbs" to opera.
Christopher Blank, "Opera Memphis plans to rock the streets with its classic hits", The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN), September 5, 2012.  Retrieved 15 April 2013
Creation of a festival
The restructuring of the season shifted the company from three mainstage productions a year to two mainstage shows a year and the addition of the Midtown Opera Festival in the spring.  The opera festival is organized as two additional smaller scale mainstage productions designed for intimate spaces or as chamber operas, as well as academic panels and pay-what-you-can shows and activities.

[[Ightfield]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Shropshire

Ightfield is a small village and civil parish in Shropshire, England.
Within the parish boundaries is another small village - Calverhall.
Ightfield is situated in one of the most rural areas one could expect to find, with many of its roots being in farming. In fact, the name could indeed be derived from Old English 'Ihtfeld' collocated from 'iht'= creature + 'feld'= field. This would be plausible considering the area's long agricultural history. Over the years, the number of farmers in the area has declined, with only a handful remaining.  Due to the reduced amount of agricultural activity, the village expanded slightly, with the addition of two new housing estates, built on previously agricultural land.
Many years ago, Ightfield had a local public house for travelers to break up their long journeys by horse and cart.  It is now long gone, and was converted into a private home some years ago.
It was mentioned as ISTEFELT in the Domesday Book and though not as important as some parishes in the area, it had its own priest which implies an established community which had its own church.  
The beautiful church of St John the Baptist which, though partly rebuilt in the 19th century, has 15th-century origins.  It stands on the northern edge of the village on a small rise, as if overlooking the village in a spiritual way.
The magnificent gargoyles seem to hang out from the tower as if determined to get a closer look at those who come to admire or worship here.  
The tower contains a peal of six bells, and the father of Shropshire novelist Mary Webb is buried in the churchyard, George Meredith, next to his father Rev. Edward Meredith sometime rector of the Parish. 
The church forms a focal point in the village, with its fantastic outlook over the surrounding countryside, it is a real place of beauty.
Ightfield Church is part of a network of five local churches (Ash, Moreton Say, Ightfield, Calverhall, Adderley - abbr. AMICA) which are within a 6 mile diameter of each other and are served mainly by the Reverend Roger Anders who resides in the rectory of nearby Moreton Say. The Amica Centre is the central administrative hub and a community centre for the AMICA Benefice, and is located in Ightfield, next to the church. The website is located at http://www.AmicaCentre.co.uk.
The loss of the Post Office in 2002 left the villagers in fear over the economic and structural growth of the village with many now having to buy groceries in the nearby Whitchurch, Shropshire.  Fortunately, this didn't hinder the development of multiple new housing estates.
The vet Tom Leonard, appearing on Vets in Practice (a BBC television programme from the late 90's) was raised 4 miles outside the village. Despite Tom moving away, the family still reside there. He has a veterinary practice in the local town of Whitchurch.

[[Child's Ercall]]
CATEGORIES: Civil parishes in Shropshire, Villages in Shropshire

Child's Ercall is a village and civil parish in Shropshire, England. It is located in a rather remote rural area between the small towns of Market Drayton and Newport: the civil parish had a total population of 599 at the 2001 census.Child's Ercall CP, Office for National Statistics The closest neighbouring village is Ollerton, around 1 mile to the west.
Its name is thought to derive from a Celtic word, perhaps the old Welsh name Ercal,Gelling, M. The place-names of Shropshire, pt.1, English Place-Name Society, 1990, pp.125-6 along with "child" in its mediaeval sense, meaning "knight".Raven, M. A Guide to Shropshire, 2005, p.50 The parish is sometimes referred to as Ercall Parva, which turned into "Little Ercall". This name saved it from confusion with the other Ercall in Shropshire - Ercall Magna, now called "High Ercall". The change from use of the names Ercall Magna and Ercall Parva to High Ercall and Little and later Child's Ercall, better suggests that the use of the term "Child's" merely alludes to it being 'Little' like a child, compared to the 'adult' High(er) Ercall, rather than any link to a term for a young knight.
The village church has a 12th-century doorway, a 13th-century arcade and 14th-century aisle, as well as stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe.
Childs Ercall Football Club are a member of the Mercian Regional League Division 2 and play their home games in the village.

[[Fantasy golf]]
CATEGORIES: Fantasy sports

Fantasy golf is a game in which the participants each assemble a team of real life golfers and then score points based on those players' performance in golf tournaments, with games typically following the US PGA Tour and the European Tour.Bolton, Rob. "Fantasy primer: Time to prepare for all formats before '11 begins", PGATOUR.com, 21 November 2010. Retrieved on 2010-12-28. Many formats exist for players' selection of golfers and point scoring.  A common variant sees a squad of golfers selected annually with a set budget based on prior performance, with weekly teams selected from the larger squads. Some fantasy golf formats, including that provided by the US PGA, focus solely on golf's Major Championships.The Majors Fantasy Challenge, PGA.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-28. Participating in fantasy golf can add enjoyment to golf viewing, as well as providing competition against other participants.
Wilfred Winkenbach devised fantasy golf in the latter part of the 1950s, in which each player selected a team of professional golfers and the person with the lowest combined total of stokes at the end of the tournament would win. Golf is a simple fantasy game to administer and keep tabs on, since you are concerned only with the scores of your team members without anything else to complicate it.

Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is a model for descriptive decisions under risk which was introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1992 (Tversky, Kahneman, 1992). It is a further development and variant of prospect theory. The  difference between this version and the original version of prospect theory is that weighting is applied to the cumulative probability distribution function, as in rank-dependent expected utility theory but not applied to the probabilities of individual outcomes. In 2002, Daniel Kahneman received the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel for his contributions to behavioral economics, in particular the development of Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT).

[[Schedule of values]]
CATEGORIES: Construction documents

The Schedule of Values is a detailed statement furnished by a construction contractor, builder or others outlining the portions of the contract sum. It allocates values for the various parts of the work and is also used as the basis for submitting and reviewing progress payments.
As a project begins, the submitter (typically the contractor or construction manager) submits a Schedule of Values based on the original contract amount to the Owner or Owner’s representative (typically a contracted architect) for review. This is reviewed by all parties and approved if it is deemed acceptable. This schedule of values can be amended by change order. 
When using the Schedule of Values (SOV) for pay applications the submitter will typically bill on a percentage basis. That is to say that the amount billed that month is __% of the overall line item. This value is then added to the total amount billed from previous pay requests. This total amount would be the total work completed to date. The balance to finish is then calculated by subtracting the total competed to date from the original line item total. The Architect or Owner’s representative will then review and approve the amount due to the contractor during that pay period.
A typical SOV is the AIA G703.

[[Image:Miyagawa Isshô-Spring Pastimes-H.jpg|thumb|300px|Love Letter from a Rival  A youth catches his boyfriend with a love letter from another. 
Jealousy in art deals with the way writers and graphic artists have approached the topic of jealousy in their works.
Jealousy is the powerful complex of emotions experienced at the loss, real or imagined, of something or someone you believe is yours, whereas envy concerns what you don’t have and would like to possess. Othello is filled with jealousy at the thought of losing Desdemona: Iago is consumed with envy of Othello’s prestige. Because jealous lovers tell multiple stories about those who arouse their jealousy, and because the emotion is so corrosive, jealousy is a common theme in literature and art, not to mention opera and cinema.

[[A Home of Your Own]]
CATEGORIES: 1964 films, British films, British comedy films, 1960s comedy films

A Home of Your Own is a 1964 British comedy film which is a brick-by-brick account of the building a young couple’s dream house. From the day when the site is first selected, to the day – several years and children later – when the couple finally move in, the story is a noisy but wordless comedy of errors as the incompetent labourers struggle to complete the house. It may well have been inspired by the success of Bernard Cribbins' classic song of the same vein from two years earlier, "Right Said Fred".
In this satirical look at British builders, many cups of tea are made, windows are broken and the same section of road is dug up over and over again by the water board, the electricity board and the gas board. 
Ronnie Barker’s put-upon cement mixer, Peter Butterworth’s short-sighted carpenter and Bernard Cribbins’ hapless stonemason all contribute to the ensuing chaos.

The Odessa National Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet is the oldest theatre in Odessa, Ukraine. The Theatre and the Potemkin Stairs are the most famous edifices in Odessa.[ref]
 p. 13.[/ref]
The first opera house was opened in 1810 and destroyed by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by Fellner & Helmer in neo-baroque (Vienna Baroque) style and opened in 1887. The architecture of the luxurious audience hall follows the late French rococo style. The unique acoustics of the horseshoe-designed hall allows to deliver even a whisper-low tone of voice from the stage to any part of the hall. The most recent renovation of the theater was completed in 2007.

CATEGORIES: 1966 films, 1966 horror films, British films, British science fiction films, British horror films, Natural horror films, Films featured in Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes, Fictional bees, Films about insects

 ''The Deadly Bees''  is a 1966 British horror–thriller film based on H.F. Heard's 1941 novel A Taste for Honey.Ed. Allan Bryce, Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood, Stray Cat Publishing, 2000 p 43-45  It was directed by Freddie Francis, and stars Suzanna Leigh, Guy Doleman, and Frank Finlay.  It was released theatrically in the United States in 1967.  It was featured in a 1998 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.
Heard's novel, which was a sort of Sherlock Holmes pastiche, had been previously adapted for television as a 60 minute drama episode of the The Elgin Hour: Season 1, Episode 11 under the title "The Sting of Death (22 Feb. 1955), starring Boris Karloff as the detective character from Heard's novel, Mr Mycroft. According to H.F. Heard's official website, kinescopes of this TV dramatisation survive, but it is not commercially available. 
Though the script was originally written from Heard's novel by noted author Robert Bloch, best known for Psycho, critics invariably derided the film, generally citing its uninspired acting, ludicrous special effects (including plastic flies glued to actors' faces to show them being "stung"), and continuity errors. 
Bloch blamed the film's poor showing on the fact he wrote it for Christopher Lee and Boris Karloff (the latter would have reprised his performance from the TV version), who ultimately were unable to be cast due to scheduling difficulties, and on the fact that the director, Freddie Francis, with the aid of a writer called Anthony Marriott, decided to 'improve' Bloch's script. Bloch had, for one thing, written the screenplay featuring the Mr Mycroft character from Heard's original novel; this character was removed at the orders of Amicus. However, according to Bloch: "I still felt the story and characters strong enough to warrant preservation, and tried to retain as much of the basic plot and atmosphere as possible, working with a synopsisation Milton Subotsky provided...I did put my kindly old villain in a wheelchair - which made the part right for Boris Karloff of course - and my red herring character was designed for Christopher Lee. But while the producers were away (or so I've been told) the director decided to improve my work; besides, Karloff and Lee were too expensive anyway...My concept was a far cry from what emerged as Frank Finlay's part. When the script was re-written the result was, in my opinion, a hybrid affair with no inner consistency or logical story-line: the bees were menacing but the characters were not. I'm sure that if Freddie Francis and I could have sat down together and discussed our disparate approaches we might well have come to an agreement which could have resulted in a stronger film; unfortunately, that wasn't feasible...as with CALIGARI and THE COUCH, I shudder every time this item is mentioned or shown...Everything in pre-production had been planned for it, and they didn't have the money to scrap all the preproduction sets, so they had to go ahead with it that way. That came off I think rather badly. This is no reflection on Anthony Marriott, the writer who took my script over there and did the rewrites, He did what he was told, and I'm sure he's very competent man, but it didn't come off in the slightest as I had written it."  From various interviews with Robert Bloch compiled and quoted in  Randall D. Larson, The Robert Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969-1986 San Bernadino, CA: Borgio Press, 1989, p. 107  
Bloch wrote in his autobiography: "Once the completed screenplay arrived in England, the problem of matching stellar schedules - and salaries - put the roles into other hands and the script itself into the hands of its director. As is often the case, he decided to improve it, with the aid of a writer called Anthony Marriott, but apparently without the knowledge of Rosenberg and Subotsky Films' producers, who left prior to production. Both of them had liked my original version, but by the time they returned, the screenplay had been improved past recognition and the shoot was already beginning. Sometime during 1966 the film was released under a new title implies Bloch's script was titled, as the novel was, A Taste for Honey The Deadly Bees. As such it soon buzzed off into critical oblivion, unwept, unhonoured and unstung" Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography (1993) p. 331-32 Bloch is reputed to have been so annoyed by the interference with his script that he never bothered to see the completed film.

[[Alpha Centauri in fiction]]

CATEGORIES: Alpha Centauri in fiction

As one of the brightest stars in Earth's night sky, and the closest known star system to the Sun, the Alpha Centauri system plays an important role in many fictional works of literature, popular culture, television, and film.
Alpha Centauri, a double star system with the binary designation Alpha Centauri AB, is the brightest visible object in the southern constellation Centaurus. Its component stars are Alpha Centauri A (the primary—somewhat larger and brighter than the Sun) and Alpha Centauri B (the secondary—slightly smaller and dimmer). These stars are of spectral classes G2V (as is the Sun) and K1V respectively; in the former case there is an obvious model and potential for planets capable of supporting complex biospheres, and in the latter, as it turns out, an even stronger probability of a stable habitable zone that is well suited for life.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/detail/iau0916/ |work=International Astronomical Union |title=The violent youth of solar proxies steer course of genesis of life |last=Guinan |first=Edward et al |authorlink=Edward Guinan |date=Aug 10, 2009 | accessdate=2011-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110516205637/http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/detail/iau0916/| archivedate= 16 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Alpha Centauri C (Proxima Centauri—a late-discovered red dwarf, and the closest known star to the Solar System) appears to be gravitationally bound to the AB system although at a considerable distance. The collection of three stars together is called Alpha Centauri AB-C.
Alpha Centauri is commonly referred to as Rigil Kentaurus[tpl]cite book |title=The Catalogues of Ptolemy, Ulugh Beigh, Tycho Brahe, Halley, and Hevelius |last=Bailey |first=Francis |authorlink= |year=1843 |publisher=Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society |location=London |volume=XIII [/tpl] (Arabic: رجل أقنطورس Rijl Qantūris[tpl]cite book |title=A Dictionary of Modern star Names: A Short Guide to 254 Star Names and Their Derivations |last1=Kunitzsch |first1=P |last2=Smart |first2=T |year=2006 |publisher=Sky Publishing Corporation |location=Cambridge, MA |page=27 [/tpl]), meaning foot of the centaur—compare Rigel in Orion—and also as Toliman (Arabic: الظلمان al-Zulmān), or the ostriches.

Door Wide Open: A Beat Love Affair In Letters, 1957-1958 is a collection of letters that were written in 1957-1958 between Joyce Johnson and Jack Kerouac.
The letters depict the rather detached and absurd romance of the two writers, and they are supplemented greatly by Johnson's own narration and related letters between Joyce and her friends and relatives. Johnson is referred to in Kerouac's novel Desolation Angels as Alyce Newman, and she has written several introductions for his works.
The relationship between the two took place during a very pivotal time period in Kerouac's life, when his fame was exploding after the release of On the Road.
Door Wide Open spans events from the couple's first meeting until after the romance had faded into friendship.

Professor Roland Levinsky (October 16, 1943 – January 1, 2007) was an academic researcher in biomedicine and a university senior manager.  His last post, which he held at the time of his death, was as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Plymouth in the United Kingdom.
He was born in South Africa to Jewish parents.  His father emigrated from the Lithuania/Poland area to South Africa to escape persecution; many of his relatives died in Nazi-German death camps. Professor Levinsky noted that "Father was a communist and we had our fair share of police raids.""Driving force of city university's growth": Western Daily Press 19 July 2006
Professor Levinsky was killed in an accident while out walking in stormy weather with his wife, on New Year's Day 2007. High winds blew down overhead power cables in a field near his house in Wembury, and a live cable touched him, causing his electrocution.
Levinsky's initial specialisation was as a paediatrician, and he became a world leader in research on immunodeficiency diseases. He worked for several years at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Subsequently, from 1990, he served as Dean and Director of Research at the Institute of Child Health of University College, London, and from 1999 until his appointment to Plymouth, as Vice-Provost for Biomedicine and Head of the Graduate School of the college. He had over 250 scientific publications to his credit.
On his appointment as the University of Plymouth's second vice-chancellor in September 2002, Levinsky set himself to lift the university from its then position as one of the leading post-1992 universities to rival much older and more research-intensive institutions.  To do so, he was willing to take unpopular decisions, such as the concentration of the university's teaching (outside the health arena) in Plymouth itself, with the closure of its campuses in Exeter, Newton Abbot (the former Seale-Hayne Agricultural College), and Exmouth (the former Rolle College of Education, moved to Plymouth in 2008). These moves undoubtedly gave Plymouth more the structure of the longer-established UK universities, and its position in the education media's league tables rose sharply in his period of office.
The new Arts building, opened in September 2007 was named The Roland Levinsky Building in his honour. A memorial fund was also established in his name.

Viral culture is a laboratory test in which samples are placed with a cell type that the virus being tested for is able to infect. If the cells show changes, known as cytopathic effects, then the culture is positive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/stv5474.asp|title=Viral culture|last=Curtis|first=Jeanette|coauthors=Caroline Rea|date=25 May 2007|work=WebMD|accessdate=2009-09-09[/tpl]
Traditional viral culture has been generally superseded by shell vial culture, in which the sample is centrifuged onto a single layer of cells and viral growth is measured by antigen detection methods. This greatly reduces the time to detection for slow growing viruses such as cytomegalovirus, for which the method was developed.[tpl]cite book|last=Storch|first=Gregory A.|coauthors=Bernard N. Fields, David Mahan Knipe, Peter M. Howley|title=Fields' Virology|editor=David Mahan Knipe, Peter M. Howley|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2007|edition=5th|volume=1|pages=3177|chapter=Diagnostic virology|isbn=0-7817-6060-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5O0somr0w18C&pg=RA1-PA570[/tpl] In addition, the centrifugation step in shell vial culture enhances the sensitivity of this method because after centrifugation, the viral particles of the sample are in close proximity to the cells.
Human and monkey cells are used in both traditional viral culture and shell vial culture.
Human virus types that can be identified by viral culture include adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella zoster virus, measles and mumps. For these, the final identification method is generally by immunofluorescence, with exception of cytomegalovirus and rhinovirus, whose identification in a viral culture are determined by cytopathic effects.Table 2 in: [tpl]cite journal |author=Leland DS, Ginocchio CC |title=Role of cell culture for virus detection in the age of technology |journal=Clin.

Cyber-Lip is a horizontally scrolling, side-view platformer shoot 'em up (this combination is sometimes referred to as "run and gun") arcade game released by SNK in 1990 for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS. The player(s) control(s) Rick and/or Brook, two human veteran soldiers, who are sent by an unspecified "federal government" into combat on a last-ditch attempt to save Earth from a malfunctioning military supercomputer in charge of all military androids. Gameplay consists of battling through large amounts of enemies, collecting power-ups and defeating several end-of-stage bosses. This makes it comparable to the likes of Metal Slug or Contra in terms of gameplay.
It is noted that a handful of members from Irem developed this title and later went on to create Metal Slug.

CATEGORIES: Defunct New Brunswick provincial electoral districts, Politics of Fredericton

Fredericton-Fort Naswaak was an electoral district returning members to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick for three elections: 1995, 1999 and 2003.
It was created in the 1994 electoral redistribution taking in the eastern most portions of the City of Fredericton taking about half of its territory from each of Fredericton North and Fredericton South on either side of the St. John River.
It elected Liberals Greg Byrne and Kelly Lamrock in the 1995 and 2003 elections respectively but elected Progressive Conservative Eric MacKenzie by a narrow margin in 1999 when his party swept the province winning 80% of the seats.
The district was abolished in the 2006 electoral redistribution when the Boundary Commission expressed a desire to use the St. John River as a natural boundary between districts.  Somewhat confusingly though, the commission re-used the name Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak for a new district wholly on the north side of the St. John River using all of the territory from that side of the river from this district as well as substantial portions of Fredericton North and Grand Lake.

He is best known for his work at the BBDO advertising agency, coining such slogans as "Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!", "Wisk beats ring around the collar", and "Shaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one."  As Creative Director at BBDO, he oversaw major campaigns for Pepsi, Burger King ("Have it Your Way"), Pillsbury and Campbell Soup.  In 1976, he left BBDO to start his own agency, James Jordan, Inc.   He later merged his agency with Case & Krone to form Jordan, Case and McGrath, a full-service agency that grew during the 1980s to $500 million in billings.  (JCM eventually became JMC&T--Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor.)   Other slogans penned by Jordan include the following: "Delta is ready when you are." "You're not fully clean unless your Zest-fully clean!"  "Soup so Chunky, you'll be tempted to use a fork.  But use a spoon--you'll want to get every drop."  "If they could just stay little 'til their Carter's wear out."  "Quaker Oats.  It's the right thing to do."  
A graduate of Amherst College, he would later serve on its board of trustees. He died of a heart attack while snorkeling in the Virgin Islands, aged 73. He was survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Mary Helen Cronin, and his seven children. He also currently has 17 grandchildren. He was an avid baseball fan who attended as many of his grandchildren's sports games as possible.

CATEGORIES: Macy's, Types of marketing, Marketing, Strategic management

the cellar is the marketing theme or concept for the group of departments that are commonly located on the first floor below ground level at the larger Macy's department store locations.  Although every Macy's has such a department, only the larger flagships actually have basement-level space devoted to the cellar concept.  The concept was pioneered in 1971 as a gourmet kitchenware marketing concept in the San Francisco flagship store of the Macy's West division. The cellar theme covers appliances, fixtures, kitchenware, and tableware.  Macy's stocks a wide range of brands in the cellar, including upscale and gourmet brands, as well as two private labels: "Tools of the Trade" for cookware, cutlery, and kitchen gadgets; and "the cellar" for flatware, dinnerware, and glassware.  
In August 2006, the Chicago flagship's basement level transitioned to this concept in preparation from the September Marshall Field's conversion.  It did so by posting the themed logos as pictured in its housewares department.

[[The Skull (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Trouble albums, 1985 albums, Metal Blade Records albums

The Skull is the second album by the American doom metal band Trouble, released in 1985. It was the follow-up to their 1984 classic debut Psalm 9.
Trouble gained critical recognition for The Skull and a successful tour followed. However, the album reflected singer Eric Wagner's struggles with substance abuse as well as growing turmoil within the group. This led to the departure of bassist Sean McAllister; he was replaced by Ron Holzner, who would remain with the band until their 2002 reunion. In early 1986, shortly after The Skull tour began, drummer Jeff Olson would also leave to attend college and the band regrouped with a new lineup later that year. Olson would reunite with Trouble in 1993 and play on the Plastic Green Head album, which was released two years later.
The album has been released for CD on four occasions: in 1990 by Enigma Records; again in 1991 by Metal Blade; remastered using the original master tapes and reissued again by Metal Blade in 1994; and again remastered and reissued by Escapi Music in October 2006, with a bonus DVD.

Ernst Ludwig II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (Coburg, 8 August 1709 – Meiningen, 24 February 1729), was a duke of Saxe-Meiningen.
He was the third but second surviving son of Ernst Ludwig I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his first wife, Dorothea Marie of Saxe-Gotha.
The death of his older brother Josef Bernhard (22 March 1724) made him the heir to the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. When his father died seven months later (24 November 1724), Ernst Ludwig - fifteen years old- inherited the duchy along with his younger brother Karl Frederick.
Because the two princes were under age when their father died, their uncles Frederik Wilhelm and Anton Ulrich served as their guardians until 1733.
Ernst Ludwig died after reigning five years, only twenty years old and unmarried. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Karl Frederick.

[[VAG Rounded]]

CATEGORIES: Corporate typefaces, Geometric sans-serif typefaces, Volkswagen Group, 1979 introductions

VAG Rundschrift or VAG Rounded (Rundschrift is German for 'round writing') is a geometric sans-serif typeface that was designed as a corporate typographic voice for the Volkswagen AG motor manufacturer.
It features rounded termini on all strokes. Volkswagen ended its use of the VAG Rounded family in the early 1990s, and it is widely available today and is licensed through Adobe Systems.
With many recent Web 2.0 startups, a clear trend in their new logos is the use of soft, rounded typefaces dominated by VAG Rounded, which is said to "lend a modern friendliness to what might otherwise be a cold trademark" The Fontfeed, March 7, 2006. fontshop.com and, [tpl]As of|2007|lc=on[/tpl], can be seen on T-Mobile USA literature. Apple Inc. has been utilizing the typeface on the keyboards of their line of notebook computers since 1999, with the release of the first-generation iBook, and on their desktop keyboards since August 2007. Australian retailer Big W has changed their logo (previously in Helvetica Neue) to light blue VAG Rounded.  Dick Smith, as part of the Woolworths Limited Group, also use this font in most of their advertising.  Bankwest also use this font for their "Happy Banking Initiative". As of Late 2006, Adecco also use the font in their publications and advertisements. It also used on early episodes of BrainPOP.http://web.archive.org/web/20000823185749/http://www.brainpop.com/science/earth/platetectonics/flashmov/subjmov.swf
The typeface was used for the Volkswagen and Audi Dealer Organization, and for all non-car related activities of Volkswagen, such as the V.A.G Bank and V.A.G Leasing. The typeface was conceived in a general overhaul of Volkswagen’s corporate identity.
Also, the typeface was used by Jollibee as a secondary text for its menu, and used a modified version of the font as the typeface of its famous logo, accompanied by the famous "Jollibee face" symbol, first used in 1997. The text and the symbol were again modified in 2011, as Jollibee unveiled a new logo that year.

[[Spite fence]]
CATEGORIES: Fences, Neighborhoods

Spite fence is a term used in American property law to refer to an overly tall fence, structure in the nature of a fence, or a row of trees, bushes, or hedges, constructed or planted between adjacent lots by a property owner who is annoyed with or wishes to annoy a neighbor, or who wishes to completely obstruct the view between lots. The fence or row of trees usually serves no purpose to the owner. Several states and local governments have fence and tree height restrictions to restrict the construction and planting of a spite fence.
In countries which follow Romano-German jurisdiction, erecting a spite fence (or a spite house) is unequivocally prohibited because of the judicial principle of prohibition of chicane: law must not be used to allow or justify causing intentional harm.

A fibula (/ˈfɪbjʊlə/, plural fibulae /ˈfɪbjʊli/) is an ancient brooch. Technically, the Latin term, fibulae, refers to Roman brooches; however, the term is widely used to refer to brooches from the entire ancient and early medieval world that continue Roman forms. Nevertheless, its use in English is more restricted than in other languages, and in particular post-Roman brooches from the British Isles are just called brooches (for example, the penannular brooches), where in German they would probably be fibulae.  Unlike most modern brooches, fibulae were not only decorative; they originally served a practical function: to fasten clothing, such as cloaks. Fibulae replaced straight pins that were used to fasten clothing in the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age. In turn, fibulae were replaced as clothing fasteners by buttons in the Middle Ages. Their descendant, the modern safety pin, remains in use today. In ancient Rome and other places where Latin was used, the same word denoted both a brooch and the fibula bone because a popular form for brooches and the shape of the bone were thought to resemble one another. 
There are hundreds of different types of fibulae. They are usually divided into families that are based upon historical periods, geography, and/or cultures. Fibulae are also divided into classes that are based upon their general forms.

[[13th Academy Awards]]

CATEGORIES: Academy Awards ceremonies, 1940 film awards, 1941 in the United States

The 13th Academy Awards honored American film achievements in 1940.  This was the first year that sealed envelopes were used to keep secret the names of the winners which led to the famous phrase: "May I have the Envelope, please." The accounting firm of Price Waterhouse was hired to count the ballots, after the fiasco of leaked voting results in 1939 by the Los Angeles Times.
For the first time, the award for Best Screenplay was split into two separate categories: Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay.
Independent producer David O. Selznick, who had produced the previous year's big winner Gone with the Wind (1939), also produced the Best Picture winner in 1940, Rebecca - and campaigned heavily for its win. Selznick was the first to produce two consecutive winners of the Best Picture Oscar. Although Rebecca had eleven nominations, it only won for Best Picture and Best Cinematography (Black and White), marking the last time a film would win Best Picture but not win for either directing, acting, or writing.
The film's studio - United Artists - was the last of the original film studios (the others were MGM, Columbia, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., Universal, and Paramount) to win the Best Picture Oscar. Rebecca was the first American-made film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and the only film from him to win Best Picture.  Hitchcock actually had two films in the running, for in addition to Rebecca his Foreign Correspondent was also in the running for Best Picture.
Pinocchio was the first animated film to take home competitive Oscars, for both Best Score and Best Song, starting a long tradition of animated films winning in these categories.
The Thief of Bagdad received the most Oscars of the evening, three, the first time a film not nominated for Best Picture won the most awards.

[[Convergent validity]]
CATEGORIES: Validity (statistics)

Convergent validity, a parameter often used in sociology, psychology, and other behavioral sciences, refers to the degree to which two measures of constructs that theoretically should be related, are in fact related.http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/convdisc.php Convergent validity, along with discriminant validity, is a subtype of construct validity.  Convergent validity can be established if two similar constructs correspond with one another, while discriminant validity applies to two dissimilar constructs that are easily differentiated.
Campbell and Fiske (1959) developed the Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix to assess the construct validity of a set of measures in a study.Campell, D. T., & Fiske, D. W. (1959). Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix. Psychological Bulletin, 56, 81-105  The approach stresses the importance of using both discriminant and convergent validation techniques when assessing new tests. In other words, in order to establish construct validity, you have to demonstrate both convergence and discrimination.http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/mtmmmat.php

[[Discriminant validity]]
CATEGORIES: Validity (statistics)

In psychology, discriminant validity tests whether concepts or measurements that are supposed to be unrelated are, in fact, unrelated.http://www.experiment-resources.com/convergent-validity.html
Campbell and Fiske (1959) introduced the concept of discriminant validity within their discussion on evaluating test validity.  They stressed the importance of using both discriminant and convergent validation techniques when assessing new tests.  A successful evaluation of discriminant validity shows that a test of a concept is not highly correlated with other tests designed to measure theoretically different concepts.  
Although there is no standard value for discriminant validity, a result less than .85 tells us that discriminant validity likely exists between the two scales.  A result greater than .85, however, tells us that the two constructs overlap greatly and they are likely measuring the same thing.  Therefore, we cannot claim discriminant validity between them.  
Consider researchers developing a new scale designed to measure Narcissism.  They may want to show discriminant validity with a scale measuring Self-esteem.  Narcissism and Self-esteem are theoretically different concepts, and therefore it is important that the researchers show that their new scale measures Narcissism and not simply Self-esteem. 
First, we can calculate the Average Inter-Item Correlations within and between the two scales:
We then use the correction for attenuation formula:
Since 0.607 is less than 0.85, we can conclude that discriminant validity exists between the scale measuring narcissism and the scale measuring self-esteem.  The two scales measure theoretically different constructs.

The February 23, 2005, French law on colonialism was an act passed by the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) conservative majority, which imposed on high-school (lycée) teachers to teach the "positive values" of colonialism to their students (article 4, paragraph 2). The law, particularly the aforementioned paragraph and articles 1 and 13, created a public uproar and opposition from the whole of the left-wing, and article 4, paragraph 2 was repealed by president Jacques Chirac (UMP) at the beginning of 2006, after accusations of historical revisionism from various teachers and historians, including Pierre Vidal-Naquet, Claude Liauzu, Olivier LeCour Grandmaison and Benjamin Stora. Its article 13 was also criticized as it supported former Organisation armée secrète militants.

Strictly Breaks is the name of a series of compilation records of songs that are widely admired as break beats. Some of the songs featured contain "open breaks" which are solo drum passages which enable djs to easily transition into them, as well as attractive to producers who loop or rearrange them to create new compositions. Following in the tradition of the Ultimate Breaks and Beats series, the Strictly Breaks records contain an eclectic range of musical styles: mainly funk and jazz, but also including soul, rock, disco and pop. Some of the offerings are well-known (the Psycho theme by Bernard Hermann) but most are relatively obscure tracks treasured by music conoisseurs and DJs. The common, but hard to define thread in all of these songs is that they are "funky". Many of the songs in the Strictly Breaks series have been sampled into new musical compositions, mainly by hip hop producers.

Proembryo, or pro-embryo, is a botanical term that has been used for centuries, to denote the series of cells that are formed after fertilization within the ovule of a flowering plant, before formation of the embryo.Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, (1913).
More recently, this same term has been given a more extensive meaning, with reference to human egg cells (ova) that have been fertilized but not yet implanted into a uterus.  This more recent meaning is synonymous with "preembryo" or "pre-embryo," and corresponds to stages with more accepted terms zygote and blastocyst.

CATEGORIES: 1940 births, 1971 deaths, People from Fajardo, Puerto Rico, Puerto Rican journalists, University of Notre Dame alumni

Manuel Eduardo López Rolón a.k.a. Eddie López (1940–1971) was a Puerto Rican journalist.
Eddie López was born in Fajardo, Puerto Rico in 1940, the son of Manuel López Canals (former employee of the Department of Agriculture/Forest Service) and Teresa Rolón Perez (home maker). He lived in Fajardo, Mayagüez, Toa Alta, Bayamón and Guaynabo where he finally settled with his wife until his death. He attended Santa Rosa High School in Bayamón, and did two years at Notre Dame University in Indiana.
His first job after leaving college was at El Mundo newspaper in 1959, where he worked for two years prior to joining The San Juan Star in July 1961. He worked as a reporter until 1963 when he was named assistant city editor.
In 1966 he advanced to city editor until one year later, when by his own choice he became a special writer and full-time columnist.
López was the kind of rare writer who was equally successful as both a comedy and news writer. He was a script writer for Tommy Muñiz productions as well as a frequent guest on WAPA-TV's Esto no tiene nombre, a Puerto Rican comedy television program almost directly based on the American television program, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. López's first script was inspired by Orson Welles 'radio broadcast adaptation of H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, and described the fictional uprising of Puerto Rico's outlying islands, Culebra, Monito and Mona (whose names in Spanish are also animal names), under the leadership of a mock veterinarian, played by López himself.  The script was reportedly so well written that the station's general manager, Norman Louveau, was awakened later that night by law enforcement officials who had received many telephone calls from concerned citizens asking whether the uprising was real.  Tommy Muñiz was forced to clear things up the following morning on another television program of his.
López was also a panelist of the political debate TV show Ante la prensa, as well as the moderator for Cara a cara ante el pais, whose format is still mimicked by political debate shows in Puerto Rico, almost four decades after the show's first airing.
Fluent in English and Spanish, extraordinarily well and diversely read, he frequently did translation work.
As a newspaper columnist, he was perhaps better known for his "Candid Flowers" (a plausible literal translation of his main character's name "Candido Flores").  These were a series of Spanish stories that relied heavily on local slang, that he then would translate literally and word for word into English.  The end result would be a hilarious short story that would only be decipherable by someone who was fluent in both languages.
Eddie's love for the arts and his vast knowledge of classical music made him a well known critic of the genre.
After finding out he was severely sick with cancer, and having started radiotherapy, he had an idea for a political parody, in which he could lampoon current political wrongdoings and blame it all on his gamma ray treatments. López recruited the equally talented Jacobo Morales, who had the idea of taking Eddie's newspaper parodies and blending them with previously censored TV scripts to produce a political parody stage show.  Morales shared comedy duties with Horacio Olivo on Esto no tiene nombre, and was a reciting poet on Silverio Pérez's jibaro music television program, Borinquen Canta, and because of this, he assembled them for what they expected would be a one-time only show.
Bob MacCoy, then entertainment editor for the Star suggested the title.
The result was, "El efecto de los rayos gamma sobre Eddie Lopez" (“The effect of gamma rays on Eddie Lopez”, now known as Los Rayos Gamma or “Los Gamma” for short), the name being a take-on on the then-current play The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds.
The string of sold out shows in late 1968 turned into a sensation. Using his charismatic sense of humor, Eddie López managed to get sworn political enemies into one room and have them all laugh at themselves. The strategy worked, and some claim the show helped ease political tension in Puerto Rico.
Eddie died in November 1971, at the rather young age of 31. His last shows were done from a wheelchair -with an oxygen tank by his side,- and his very last show occurred three days before his death. He managed to make people laugh until the end, and only felt sorry that he could not do more.
In 1972, The Best of Eddie Lopez, a collection of his columns selected by Lopez himself,  was published by Ediciones Puerto, Inc. with a prologue by Juan M. Garcia-Passalacqua.  This collection is a great sampler of the wit and humor of this very funny man.  A master of spoofs and plays on words of current events.  A few of the articles especially the one entitled "Political Verbiage" is timely today.
Shortly after his death, the Overseas Press Club of Puerto Rico announced that it would establish a yearly award to "most distinguished contribution to journalism" known as the Eddie López Special Award.
After his death, Los Rayos Gamma would go on as scheduled per his request. "The show must go on" he insisted. Friend and fellow comedic actor, Efraín López Neris (already added to the roster) would take Eddie's place, while an empty chair would be left on stage in his honor.  Eventually, "Los Gamma" became a popular TV show, and ultimately would make its way back to the stage just around each election year, this time with the help of well known comic Sunshine Logroño filling Eddie's shoes.
Eddie was buried in the old San Juan cemetery, alongside Puerto Rican heroes like José de Diego, and Pedro Albizu Campos. His funeral was attended by governors, senators, colleagues, and  members of the media.
His satirical journalism style is still taught at the University of Puerto Rico, and his "Rayos Gamma" was left in very good hands.

[[Frank Brennan (karateka)]]

CATEGORIES: Shotokan practitioners, British karateka, Living people, 1960 births

Frank Brennan, is a Shotokan karateka born on 6 May 1960 in the City of Liverpool. He was a British karate champion in the 1970s and 1980s, winning a wide variety of titles both as an individual and as part of the KUGB team. He remains a well-known and well-respected KUGB instructor and coach.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theshotokanway.com/frankbrennanprofile.html |title= Frank Brennan Profile|author= The Shotokan Way|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=21 May 2010[/tpl]
Always sport-oriented, Brennan took up gymnastics while at school. At the age of twelve he tried to join the Red Triangle Karate Club, but he was told to go and join the judo club for a year because he was too young. He started to train at the club in 1973 under the tuition of Andy Sherry and KUGB chief instructor Keinosuke Enoeda.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kugb.org/profiles/profiles_brennan.html |title= Instructor Profiles|author= Karate Union of Great Britain|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=28 May 2010[/tpl]
His competition career began in 1974 when he competed in the KUGB Northern Regional Championships as a 4th kyu, entering and winning the junior kata event. His introduction to kumite was even more dramatic; in 1975, while fighting for the Red Triangle team, Bob Poynton broke his leg in one of the matches. The team had no reserves, so the young Brennan, now a brown belt who had only entered the kata event, was suddenly in the final of the team kumite event against Leeds. He fought one of Leeds' most experienced fighters, Andy Harris, and decisively beat him with a fast mawashi geri combination to achieve a Red Triangle win.
His first international appearance was with the KUGB squad in the European Championships in Sweden in 1978, where he came 2nd in the senior kata event. In Belgium the following year he won the Grand Championship of Europe, taking both kumite and kata events, later repeating this feat on three occasions.
As a fighter he is equally at home using hands or feet, often surprising opponents with dynamic combinations of the more unusual hand or foot techniques. He has been described as the most technically gifted karateka of his generation, combining an exciting fighting style with a calm demeanor.[tpl]cite book |title=Karate |last=Healy |first=Kevin |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Time-Life Books |location=London |isbn=1-85906-102-8 |page=126 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=22CKm1jDOowC&pg=PA126&dq=frank+brennan+karate&cd=1#v=onepage&q=frank%20brennan%20karate&f=false |accessdate=[/tpl] As a senior member of the KUGB International Squad a highlight of his career was leading his team to victory in the 1990 World Shotokan Championships in Sunderland. He is held in great respect internationally - in an interview at the World Championships, the Japanese team coach, ex-world Champion Masahiko Tanaka said that the one man who the whole Japanese Team were specifically trained to beat was Frank Brennan.

[[Lord John Roxton]]

CATEGORIES: Professor Challenger characters, Fictional explorers, Fictional hunters

Lord John Roxton (A fictional title derived from the English parish of Roxton, Bedfordshire) is a supporting character in the Professor Challenger series of stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. He makes his initial appearance in the first entry of this series, The Lost World, wherein he is a member of the expedition to the eponymous land of the title, and is a prominent character in some of the subsequent stories as well, specifically The Poison Belt and The Land of Mist. The narrator of The Lost World, Edward D. Malone, describes him as being tall and thin, with peculiarly rounded shoulders, skin which is "a rich flower-pot red from sun and wind" and cool, masterful blue eyes. Malone compares him to Don Quixote and Napoleon III as well as to the quintessential English sporting gentleman. Roxton greets the prospect of visiting the Lost World with delight, largely because of the prospect of bringing home a dinosaur as a hunting trophy:

Roxton has travelled the world, as a hunter in addition to his pursuits as an explorer in the main bodies of the novels. Being an enemy of slavery, he made enemies in Brazil in his campaign against that institution, a fact which comes into play over the course of the plot of The Lost World.
The titular "lost world" is located on a remote South American plateau, accessed by using a felled tree as a bridge across a vast sheer drop. When Lord John Roxton and the other members of his expedition use this makeshift bridge to enter the Lost World, Roxton is the only one who takes the easy but dangerous option of walking across it; all the others straddle the tree and carefully inch their way across.
The character was based on Conan Doyle's friend & British Consul/Irish patriot Roger Casement.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]

Turbo cooking is a hybrid way of quickly preparing food that may taste better than simply warming something in a microwave. For instance microwave something then place it under the broiler to be browned as a finish. Another way to turbo cook is to use near-boiling water from an instant-hot tap when starting soup or pasta.

[[Opus vermiculatum]]
CATEGORIES: Mosaic, Italian mosaic

Opus vermiculatum is a type of mosaic which draws an outline around shapes using tesserae.  This can be one or more rows and then contrasted in the background, typically with Opus tessellatum.  The outline created is often light and offset by a dark background for greater contrast.  The name opus vermiculatum literally means "worm-like work", and has been described as the being one of the most demanding and elaborate forms of Roman mosaic.Berman, Alan (2000). Floors. frances lincoln ltd. ISBN 0-7112-1612-6. p. 72.  Usually opus vermiculatum is meant to put emphasis on the main design and foreground details of a work, using a smooth and flowing halo-effect.  Sometimes it was used only around the head of a figure.  The tesserae used were often square but can be variously shaped.Strong, Donald (June 1, 1992).

CATEGORIES: 1687 births, 1763 deaths, House of Saxe-Meiningen, Dukes of Saxe-Meiningen, People from Meiningen, Princes of Saxe-Meiningen, Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Poland)

Anton Ulrich, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (Meiningen, 22 October 1687 – Frankfurt, 27 January 1763), was a duke of Saxe-Meiningen.
He was the second but first surviving son (in order of birth he was the eighth) of Bernhard I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his second wife, Elisabeth Eleonore of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.
When his father died in 1706, according to his will, he inherited the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen with his two older half-brothers, Ernst Ludwig I and Frederick Wilhelm.
But, shortly after, Ernst Ludwig signed a contract between him and his brothers, and they were compelled to leave all the control of the duchy in his hands. Without any power in his duchy, Anton Ulrich decided to travel to the Netherlands.
When Ernst Ludwig died (in 1724), Anton Ulrich and Frederick Wilhelm took over once again the government of the duchy as guardians of his nephews until 1733. During this time, Anton Ulrich was only nominal regent, because he decided to live apart with his morganatic family.
The deaths of his old half-brothers and nephews (1724–1743) made him the next in the line for the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. His wife, Philippine, had died in 1744, only a few weeks before a declaration was published which deprived his children of the succession of the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. In 10 March 1746, Anton Ulrich assumed full control of the duchy after the death of his last surviving half-brother, Frederick Wilhelm.
Immediately after he inherited the duchy, Anton Ulrich left Meiningen and established his official residence at Frankfurt, where he lived until his death.

[[New England city and town area]]

CATEGORIES: United States Census Bureau geography, Metropolitan areas of the United States, New England

A New England City and Town Area (NECTA) is a geographic and statistical entity defined by the U.S. federal government for use in the six-state New England region of the United States. NECTAs are analogous to metropolitan statistical areas and micropolitan statistical areas and are defined using the same criteria, except that they are defined on the basis of New England towns instead of entire counties. NECTAs are classified as either metropolitan or micropolitan NECTAs. A micropolitan NECTA has an urban core with a population of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000, whereas a  metropolitan NECTA has an urban core with a population of at least 50,000. 
In New England, towns (which are classified by the United States Census Bureau as minor civil divisions) are a much more important level of government than counties. Because towns are smaller than counties, a NECTA usually provides a much closer approximation to the real metropolitan area than a metropolitan statistical area does.
Large NECTAs (with population greater than 2.5 million) may be subdivided into smaller groupings known as NECTA Divisions. Adjacent NECTAs that have a high degree of employment interchange may also be combined to form Combined NECTAS (or CNECTAs). NECTAs that are part of a CNECTA retain their separate identities.

[[29th Academy Awards]]
CATEGORIES: Academy Awards ceremonies, 1956 film awards

During the 29th Academy Awards, the regular competitive category of Best Foreign Language Film was introduced, instead of only being recognized as a Special Achievement Award or as a Best Picture nominee (as in 1938). The first winner in this new category was Federico Fellini's La strada with Anthony Quinn and a second nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Its win would help spur an interest in foreign-language films. Another Fellini film, Nights of Cabiria would win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in the following year.
This was also the first year that all of the five Best Picture nominees were in color.
All of the major awards winners were large-scale epics - Mike Todd's Around the World in Eighty Days, The King and I, Anastasia, Giant, Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments (the highest grossing film of the year), King Vidor's War and Peace, and William Wyler's Friendly Persuasion. And the trend toward blockbusters and colorful spectaculars was established for years to come, with The Bridge on the River Kwai, Gigi, and Ben-Hur being subsequent Best Picture champions.
The Best Original Story category had two interesting quirks this year.  First, the Oscar for Best Original Story went to Robert Rich (also known as Dalton Trumbo) for The Brave One.  Trumbo was blacklisted at the time so he could not get screen credit under his own name.  Second, Edward Bernds and Elwood Ullman withdrew their names from consideration in this category for their work on High Society.  The nomination was apparently intended for the musical starring Grace Kelly, but Bernds and Ullman had instead worked on a Bowery Boys movie of the same title.  Indeed, this nomination was a double mistake.  High Society was based on the play and movie The Philadelphia Story and probably would not have qualified as an original story anyway.
It was here that James Dean became the only actor to receive a second posthumous – and consecutive – nomination for acting.
Director John Ford's classic western The Searchers, widely seen as one of the best American films of all time, failed to receive a single nomination.
This was the second time since the introduction of the Supporting Actor and Actress awards that Best Picture, Best Director, and all four acting Oscars were given to different films.  This would not happen again until the 78th Academy Awards.

An earlier series of Maui dollars was issued in the 1970s by the Maui Chamber of Commerce in a similar size, although thinner and made of copper. On one such undated coin the words "LAHAINA FIRST CAPITAL" are written along the bottom and "MAUI DOLLAR" along the top, with the Kingdom of Hawaii coat of arms in the center flanked by two sailing ships.  The reverse side features a picture of the "IAO NEEDLE" in the center with the Hawaiian phrase, "MAUI NO KA OI" above and the words, "THE VALLEY ISLE" below.  Another copper coin is dated 1976.

[[Party bike]]
CATEGORIES: Cycle types, Transport in Amsterdam

A party bike, pedal crawler, pedibus, cycle pub, beer bike, or bierbike is a multi-passenger human powered vehicle. A party bike is sometimes mistaken for a larger scale version of a pedicab, but it is not since the party bike is powered by the passengers while the steering and braking is controlled by the driver who does not provide pedaling power. Some also double as rolling refreshment stands. Human-powered party bikes have been in use for decades and have grown into several families of vehicles for a variety of purposes, including tourist rentals and private touring. They are not used as pedal taxis or pedicabs since the driver provides no power to the party bike and cannot pick up “fares” in the customary sense. They are often available at tourist attractions where they are rented by the hour or day and often serve as a rolling refreshment stand. When used in conjunction with alcohol, the driver is usually hired with the party bike.

CATEGORIES: Cavalry units and formations of the Soviet Union, Field armies of the Soviet Union, Military units and formations established in 1918, 1918 establishments in Russia, Soviet Cavalry Armies

The 1st Cavalry Army ([tpl]lang-ru|Первая конная армия[/tpl], literally '1st Mounted Army') was the most prominent Red Army military formation.'1st Horse Army' can be seen as a better literal translation  It was also known as Budyonny's Cavalry Army or simply as Konarmia ('Horsearmy'). 
When the Russian Civil War broke out in 1918, a soldier named Budyonny organized a small cavalry force in the Don region out of local Cossacks. This force rapidly grew in numbers, sided with the Bolsheviks and eventually became the 1st Cavalry Army.  It was transformed from a guerrilla force into a proper military unit under the command of Semyon Budyonny, and the political guidance of Kliment Voroshilov.  
This Army played an important role in winning the Civil War for the Bolsheviks, driving the White General Anton Denikin back from Moscow. 
In 1920 Budyonny's Cavalry Army took part in the fighting the invasion of Poland during the Polish-Bolshevik War, at first with remarkable success.  The 1st Cavalry Army pushed Polish forces out of Ukraine and broke through Polish southern frontlines, but later was bogged down at Lvov.  This in turn led to a heavy defeat of the rest of the Bolsheviks forces in the Battle of Warsaw. When Budyonny's Cavalry finally joined the battle it was also soundly defeated in the Battle of Komarów, known as the last great cavalry battle in history. At this point, the 1st Cavalry Army's morale and discipline were at a low point and robbery and violence against the civilian population became commonplace.  
The remains of 1st Cavalry Army were sent south to fight the Wrangel’s White forces in Ukraine and the Crimea. At the final phase of Russian Civil War the 1st Cavalry Army was moved to North Caucasus.  This voyage was the basis of myth about the invincible 1st Cavalry Army, which has been cultivated by Soviet propaganda.
The march of the 1st Cavalry Army became popular after the Russian Civil War and was known as the song We are the Red Cavalry ([tpl]lang-ru|Мы красная кавалерия[/tpl]) (however other names of the song were "Мы красные кавалеристы" (We, Red cavalrymen) and "Буденного" (Budenny march), but earlier was known as "Марш красных конников" (March of the Red horsemen).
In commemoration, a monument to the 1st Cavalry Army was constructed in Lvov oblast, Ukraine.

[[The Wake (US band)]]
CATEGORIES: American gothic rock groups, Alternative rock groups from Ohio, Musical groups from Columbus, Ohio

The Wake is an American gothic rock band from Columbus, Ohio.  Formed in 1986 by vocalist Troy Payne and guitarist Richard Witherspoon in Columbus, Ohio USA – The Wake made its’ first studio recording “Procession” using session musicians on drums and bass in 1987.  Bassist James Tramel and electronic drummer Scott Rozanski were recruited later the same year. This lineup quickly recorded first versions of tracks like: “Burial”, “Shelia”, and “Locomotive Age”, creating a rough template for what would become The Wake’s signature sound.
Acoustic drummer Daniel C. replaced Rozanski early in 1989. Driven forward by Daniel’s acoustic drum sound, the band moved substantially towards the rock and roll end of the sonic spectrum. Hoping to add yet another dimension to their sound, keyboardist Robert Brothers was added to the mix in 1990.  
In a move to gain exposure, the band started Blaylox Records. Named after the band’s mascot cat, the label proved to be the perfect outlet for the band’s creativity, and a vehicle for spreading the band’s sound far and wide. Bolstered by the sales of the their demo cassette - The Wake burst on to the NYC goth club scene with their 7” vinyl single “Harlot” in 1990. 
Following on the success of “Harlot”, the band released a second 7” - “Sideshow” on the Blaylox Records label in 1992. The combination of the popularity of these two singles, and the moxie of an influential NYC DJ, led to the band signing with Cleopatra Records in 1993. Considered by many fans of Gothic rock as a “landmark record”, The Wake’s debut album “Masked” was released in October 1993. 
After the completion of the “Masked” tour, the band parted ways with bass player James Tramel. New bassist Steven Creighton was brought into the fold before the release of the “Christine EP” in 1995. The EP had a decidedly industrial/dance flavor, thanks in part to the re-mixes supplied by Rosetta Stone. The single “Christine” (mixed by The Wake and Zane Eric Brown) broke onto the top ten of Alternative Press’s Dance Club charts where it remained for months. Also in ‘95, the still popular “Christine” video was filmed in and around Mexico City during the tour supporting the EP.
In 1996, The Wake joined forces with former Ministry engineer “Fluffy” on their third CD – “Nine Ways”. The album was recorded and mixed at both Chicago Trax, and the Chicago Recording Company. 
Just before the release of “Nine Ways”, guitarist and co-founder Rich Witherspoon left the band and former MCA recording artist Mark Gamiere was enlisted to take over at guitar. Though no studio recordings were made with this lineup, Gamiere provided live tour support from 1996 to 2000. Other lineup changes include the late J.T. Murphy replacing Steven Creighton on bass in 1998. The band turned bass playing duty over to a hard-disk recorder in 1999 before giving way to a hiatus in 2000.
Fast forward to 2008: The Wake surprise fans with “BLACKlist” - a “best of” compilation DVD with bonus un-released material, rare tracks and video. Released on MVD/Cleopatra.
Released on Blaylox Records in 2010 - The Wake's single “Emily Closer” features the reunited lineup of Payne, Witherspoon, Tramel, Brothers, and Daniel C. and was recorded and self-produced before being mastered by Howie Weinberg at Masterdisk. 
December 2013, The Wake announce the imminent release of a new single - “Rusted” and remix by legendary musician/producer John Fryer. Released on Blaylox Records, the single features the lineup of Troy Payne, Rich Witherspoon, and Daniel C.. 
To date, The Wake has been featured on thirty plus compilations world-wide. In addition, the band has amassed an impressive and diverse list of opening dates with bands such as NIN, Skinny Puppy, Christian Death, Innocence Mission, Alien Sex Fiend, And Also the Trees, and Shadow Project - touring extensively in the US and playing dates in Europe and Mexico.

Out of the ten tracks, only one ("The Little Things in Life") was written as a collaboration between McCall and Chip Davis, the man responsible for popularizing the distinctive McCall persona, while one other, "Silver Cloud Breakdown", was composed by Davis several years earlier and was featured in the movie Convoy, though it was not present on its soundtrack.

[[Compartmentalization (information security)]]
CATEGORIES: Data security, National security, Classified information, Intelligence (information gathering)

In matters concerning information security, whether public or private sector, compartmentalization is the limiting of access to information to persons or other entities who need to know it in order to perform certain tasks. 
The concept originated in the handling of classified information in military and intelligence applications.
The basis for compartmentalization was the idea that, if fewer people know the details of a mission or task, the risk or likelihood that such information could be compromised or fall into the hands of the opposition is decreased. Hence, varying levels of clearance within organizations exist. Yet, even if someone has the highest clearance, certain "compartmentalized" information, identified by codewords referring to particular types of secret information, may still be restricted to certain operators, even with a lower overall security clearance. Information marked this way is said to be codeword–classified. One famous example of this was the Ultra secret, where documents were marked "Top Secret Ultra": "Top Secret" marked its security level, and the "Ultra" keyword further restricted its readership to only those cleared to read "Ultra" documents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-08.pdf|title=Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, First Edition, Chapter 8.2: Compartmentation, the Chinese Wall, and the BMA Model|author=Ross Anderson|page=161[/tpl]
Compartmentalization is now also used in commercial security engineering as a technique to protect information such as medical records.

[[Compartmentalization (fire protection)]]

CATEGORIES: Passive fire protection

Compartmentalization in structures, such as land-based buildings, traffic tunnels, ships, aerospace vehicles, or submarines, is the fundamental basis and aim of passive fire protection.
The idea is to divide a structure into "fire compartments", which may contain single or multiple rooms, for the purpose of limiting the spread of fire, smoke and flue gases, in order to enable the three goals of fire protection:
The construction of such compartments and all their components is a matter of systems within systems, which use bounding to achieve fire-resistance ratings, all interdependent, forming part of an overall fire safety plan. All components forming part of such a compartment are subject to stringent bounding in countries, where product certification is mandatory.

Compartmentalization is an unconscious psychological defense mechanism used to avoid cognitive dissonance, or the mental discomfort and anxiety caused by a person's having conflicting values, cognitions, emotions, beliefs, etc. within themselves.  
Compartmentalization allows these conflicting ideas to co-exist by inhibiting direct or explicit acknowledgement and interaction between separate compartmentalized self states.[tpl]cite book|author=Tangney|editors=Leary, Mark R.

Head restraints are an automotive safety feature, attached or integrated into the top of each seat to limit the rearward movement of the adult occupant's head, relative to the torso, in a collision — to prevent or mitigate whiplash or injury to the cervical vertebrae.UNECE Regulation 17: Uniform Provisions Concerning the Approval of Vehicles With Regard to the Seats, Their Anchorages and Any Head RestraintsFMVSS No. 202, Head Restraints for Passenger Vehicles: Preliminary Economic Assessment and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Since their mandatory introduction in the late 1960s, head restraints have prevented or mitigated thousands of serious injuries. 
A patent for an automobile "headrest" was granted to Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921.US Patent 1471168: Headrest for Automobile Seats and the Like Additional patents for such devices were issued in 1930US Patent 1781600: Combined Automobile Headrest and Strap Hanger and in 1950,US Patent 2502801: Headrest for Automobile Seats and subsequently. The major U. K. supplier of head restraints, Karobes, filed patents in the late 1950s and was still competitive in 1973 when British tests evaluated the quality of these devices.New Scientist: Head rests take a bashing, July 5, 1973.
Optional head restraints began appearing on North American cars in the late 1960s,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] and were mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in all new cars sold in the U.S. after 1 January 1969. The U.S. regulation, called Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 202, requires that head restraints meet one of the following two standards of performance, design, and construction:
An evaluation performed by NHTSA in 1982 on passenger cars found that "integral" head restraints—a seat back extending high enough to meet the [tpl]convert|27.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] height requirement—reduces injury by 17 percent, while adjustable head restraints, attached to the seat back by one or more sliding metal shafts, reduce injury by 10 percent. NHTSA has said this difference may be due to adjustable restraints being improperly positioned.

The Dublin City Cup is a defunct Irish football tournament which was played for by all League of Ireland sides (and not just those from Dublin city as the name suggests).  It ran from 1933 and ran uninterrupted until 1973.  In season 1975/76 it was revived and played for by sides who did not reach the League of Ireland Cup quarter finals.  In 1983/84 it was revived again but only 8 teams were invited to play, the 6 Dublin sides (Bohemians, Shamrock Rovers, Shelbourne, St Patrick's Athletic, UCD and Home Farm) along with Drogheda United and Dundalk.
It was played in a variety of formats; from complete round robin series to straight knock out tournaments. From the 1951/52 season it was played as a knockout tournament. It was traditionally seen as the fourth most important competition for League of Ireland sides (after the League, FAI Cup and League of Ireland Shield or League Cup).
In 1956/57 and 1959/60 Shamrock Rovers beat Drumcondra in the final on corners after drawing the game itself.

General José Ignacio de Gorriti (1770 – 9 November 1835) was an Argentine statesman, soldier and lawyer. He was a representative to the Congress of Tucumán which on 9 July 1816 declared the Independence of Argentina.
Gorriti was born in Jujuy to Feliciana Coeto and Ignacio de Gorriti Navarro, members of the local gentry. He and his brother, Juan Ignacio de Gorriti (later a prominent priest and lawmaker), studied at the Montserrat School in Córdoba. In 1788 he entered the University of Chuquisaca, graduating in canonical and civil law. He was forced to return to Jujuy on the death of his father to look after the family and their interests. In 1802 he married Facunda Zuviría.
In 1810, following the May Revolution, Gorriti became an active and vocal supporter of the revolutionary cause. He campaigned with the Army of the North and alongside General Martín Güemes, and was subsequently elected by a grateful Salta to the Tucumán Congress, serving in 1816 for the declaration. When the Congress moved to Buenos Aires in 1817, he resigned to continue to work in Salta with Güemes. He had a distinguished role in the campaign, organising the gaucho cavalry and in 1820 won a key battle against the royalists.
Gorriti was made governor of Salta Province in 1822 and served with distinction, having a second term between 1827 and 1829. He had several further military successes both against Spanish forces and against the Federals under Juan Facundo Quiroga. Quiroga's later success, however, obliged him to go in exile to Bolivia, where he died penniless with many children.
Gorriti's daughter was Juana Manuela Gorriti, the writer, who married future Bolivian President, Manuel Isidro Belzu.

In its most known World War II guise, it was formed at the end of World War II, under Rear Admiral Oscar C. Badger II, to begin the occupation of Japan. The TF 31 combatant ships were the first to enter Tokyo Bay when the US was not certain what kind of reception was waiting from the Japanese. The Task Force transported US Marine units to the Miura Peninsula area of Japan, which forms the southwest arm of Tokyo Bay, for occupation duties. The Marines were tasked with securing the military bases at Yokosuka and demilitarizing the entire peninsula.

The calc-alkaline magma series is one of two main magma series in igneous rocks, the other magma series being the tholeiitic. A magma series is a series of compositions that describes the evolution of a mafic magma, which is high in magnesium and iron and produces basalt or gabbro, as it fractionally crystallizes to become a felsic magma, which is low in magnesium and iron and produces rhyolite or granite. Calc-alkaline rocks are rich in alkaline earths (magnesia and calcium oxide) and alkali metals and make up a major part of the crust of the continents.
The diverse rock types in the calc-alkaline series include volcanic types such as basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyolite, and also their coarser-grained intrusive equivalents (gabbro, diorite, granodiorite, and granite). They do not include silica-undersaturated, alkalic, or peralkaline rocks.

Joseph Dollard Herve St. Laurent (born May 12, 1929) is a retired Canadian ice hockey defenceman.
Dollard started his National Hockey League career with the Montreal Canadiens in 1951.  He would spend eight years in Montreal before being traded to the Chicago Black Hawks.  He won four Stanley Cups with the Habs and one with the Black Hawks 
He started out with the Jr. Canadiens of the QJHL where he skated for two seasons from 1947 to 1949. There he demonstrated an offensive touch and an ability to play a tough game of defence at the other end of the ice.  In 1949–50, St. Laurent started a three-year relationship with the Montreal Royals of the QSHL. He spent most of his time sharpening the finer points of his game while putting them to the occasional test by joining the Habs for a couple of stints.
Around 1952–53, however, the Canadiens began to introduce significant new blood in the form of Jacques Plante and Dickie Moore among others. Dollard helped Montreal win the Stanley Cup in 1953. One of the others included St. Laurent who settled onto the Habs' blueline corps as a stay-at-home regular for the next six seasons. His efforts contributed to three straight Stanley Cup victories between 1956, 1957, 1958.
After the third championship, St. Laurent was sold to the Chicago Black Hawks who were gradually assembling a lineup bent on bringing the Cup to town after a lengthy absence. In 1960–61, the team finally ended the championship drought by ousting the Red Wings in the finals.
St. Laurent played for the Hawks until the end of the 1961–62 campaign. The following year, he was dispatched to the Quebec Aces of the AHL, during which St. Laurent took a hard fall to the ice, breaking his leg and ending his aspirations to make it back to the NHL. At the end of the season, he announced his retirement.

Laurence Coughlan  (?-1784?) was an Irish-born itinerant preacher who was active in Newfoundland during the period 1766–1773. Though born a Roman Catholic, ordained and employed as an Anglican, and at one point even ordained by a Greek Orthodox bishop, his true religious affiliation was Methodism, to which he converted in the 1750s. Coughlan is regarded as a founder of the Methodist Church in Newfoundland (later incorporated into the United Church of Canada).
In the years after his conversion, Coughlan served as a lay preacher in England and Ireland, and for a time was a close associate of Methodist founder John Wesley. However, Coughlan's subjective, enthusiastic,  emotional, and feeling-based approach to his faith and ministry later led Wesley to distance himself from him. This was exacerbated by Coughlan's ordination in 1764, along with several other Methodists, by a certain Erasmus, said to be a Greek Orthodox bishop.
In the 1760s a group in the Harbour Grace, Newfoundland area were attempting to procure a minister. In 1766, through the mediation of a local merchant with connections in England, a request was made to the Bishop of London to ordain Coughlan and provide for him to travel to Newfoundland. The reason for the choice of Coughlan for this mission is unclear, but it is known that both the Newfoundland group and their contacts in England had links to dissenters. The entreaty was successful, and Coughlan was ordained by the Bishop of Chester in April 1766. Shortly thereafter, Coughlan left for Newfoundland; a few months later, his ministry came under the auspices of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG).
Initially at least, Coughlan carried out the expected duties of an Anglican priest, performed the sacraments, established a school and chapels, and became a Justice of the Peace. However, his real theological motivation was to spread Methodism, which he did through the Methodist practice of small group meetings and classes, and house to house preaching, emphasizing a simple, emotional spirituality, a life of personal morality, and the necessity of a personal conversion or "born again" experience. By his own account, in his 1776 publication An Account of the Work of God in Newfoundland, his attempts to inspire a Methodist "revival" met with little success for three years, after which time the sorts of "noisy" conversions that he encouraged began to take place.
Coughlan's mission was to the lower classes, fishermen and planters, and many of his converts were women. His popularity among the elite and merchant classes, however, was somewhat lacking, and this sector caused Coughlan much trouble and eventually led to his leaving Newfoundland. For one thing, his Methodist ways did not go unnoticed: in 1770 he was accused of denying communion to those who did not participate in Methodist meetings; though the charge did not stick, he did admit his preference in such matters. Some of the tension may have been economic in origin, as  the improvement in the personal and economic conduct of the Methodist converts helped them to become more independent of the local merchants. Coughlan was eventually forced to resign his position in 1773 after refusing to allow a merchant to act as godfather, questioning the man's morals.
Back in England, Coughlan was unsuccessful in rejoining the orthodox Methodist movement, and instead spend his time among Methodist dissenters with a Calvinist orientation. His 1776 Account recounts his ministry in Newfoundland, and, while decrying the severity of the climate, displays a great affection for the "simple", "artless" people of his congregation, praising their practical "genius" despite their lack of formal education. It also contains descriptions of deathbed conversions, and letters from supporters.

[[Magmatism]]
CATEGORIES: Geological processes

The formation of igneous rocks from magma is known as Magmatism.
Magmatism is a process responsible for mountain formation. The process of magmatism produces an additional mass and volume to the Earth’s surface. For example the formation of volcanoes or island arcs at convergent plate boundaries. Or mid-ocean ridges and therefore ocean-floor spreading at divergent plate boundaries.
Magmas form by partial melting of silicate rocks either in Earth's mantle, the continental or the oceanic crust.

Samuel C. Brightman (1911–1992) was a journalist, war correspondent, freelance writer and adult educator.
Brightman started his career with the Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal covering education and politics and eventually becoming their Washington correspondent.  In 1939 he spent seven months travelling a Europe on the verge of war, writing a series of articles for the Courier-Journal (his last installment was written from Poland shortly before Hitler invaded).
He enlisted in the army in World War II and was assigned as a Public Relations Officer, responsible for transport, billeting, and general assistance for a group of newspaper reporters.  He and his collection of reporters landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day with the American forces; Brightman's were the first reports to reach the U.S. after the landing, despite the fact that their equipment landed nearly a mile away and there was no reliable route for their stories.  Brightman received a Bronze Star for his efforts.
After the war he took a position with the Democratic National Committee, an organization he remained with for nearly twenty years in various capacities including Deputy Director of Publicity, Director of Publicity, and managing editor of their monthly publication, The Democratic Digest, later called The Democrat.  He was involved in several Democratic National Conventions in the 1950s and 1960s, generating publicity, press releases, and informational brochures for the party. 
Throughout his career he wrote extensively — columns, newsletters, essays, and speeches — on health care, the perils of aging, politics and political humor and, in his later years, on the importance of education in a democratic society and on ways to encourage civic literacy in the general population.  He was the founding editor of "Adult and Continuing Education Today" and the first journalist to devote his full time to covering adult education.

It has been described as having "perhaps the most spectacular manor house interior in Dorset." In the sixteenth century the solar wing was extended to the north and the hall remodeled by architect Thomas White and his wife Anne; the house remained in the White family until at least the time of Charles I. After the Restoration, it was bought by Sir Thomas Freke and retained by his descendants, the Pitt-Rivers family; they reduced the length of the hall by [tpl]convert|2|m|ft[/tpl], it having previously extended almost to the River Stour, and added a new fireplace and ceiling. By 1956, however, the 18th-century building had been demolished and the original, 14th-century part was derelict; by 1962, only the northern wing remained habitable, and the original section passed into state ownership. The house underwent restoration during the 1970s by the Department for the Environment—now the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).

The invasion of Tulagi, on 3–4 May 1942, was part of Operation Mo, the Empire of Japan's strategy in the South Pacific and South West Pacific Area in 1942. The plan called for Imperial Japanese Navy troops to capture Tulagi and nearby islands in the Solomon Islands Protectorate. The occupation of Tulagi by the Japanese was intended to cover the flank of and provide reconnaissance support for Japanese forces that were advancing on Port Moresby in New Guinea, provide greater defensive depth for the major Japanese base at Rabaul, and serve as a base for Japanese forces to threaten and interdict the supply and communication routes between the United States and Australia and New Zealand.
Without the means to effectively resist the Japanese offensive in the Solomons, the British Resident Commissioner of the Solomon Islands protectorate and the few Australian troops assigned to defend Tulagi evacuated the island just before the Japanese forces arrived on 3 May. The next day, however, a U.S. aircraft carrier task force en route to resist the Japanese forces advancing on Port Moresby (that resulted in the Battle of the Coral Sea) struck the Japanese Tulagi landing force in an air attack, destroying or damaging several of the Japanese ships and aircraft involved in the landing operation. Nevertheless, the Japanese troops successfully occupied Tulagi and began the construction of a small naval base.
Over the next several months, the Japanese established a naval refueling, communications, and seaplane reconnaissance base on Tulagi and the nearby islets of Gavutu and Tanambogo, and in July 1942 began to build a large airfield on nearby Guadalcanal. The Japanese activities on Tulagi and Guadalcanal were observed by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, as well as by Australian coastwatcher personnel stationed in the area. Because these activities threatened the Allied supply and communication lines in the South Pacific, Allied forces counter-attacked with landings of their own on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942, initiating the critical Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces that, along with the New Guinea campaign, decided the course of the war in the South Pacific.

The New Westminster Police Department (NWPD) is the police force for the City of New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.
The force was created in 1873 when the city council hired Jonathan Morey, a former sergeant with the Royal Engineers, Columbia detachment who stayed behind after the detachment was disbanded in 1863. Prior to that, New Westminster was policed by ad hoc temporary appointments of members of the community to act as magistrates. The British Columbia Provincial Police also policed the city a few years before the NWPD was formed. The force now has around one hundred members. Key events that affected the development of the city's police department include the Great Fire of 1898, a Bank of Montreal theft in 1911, and the introduction of new policing technologies, such as two-way radio patrol cars in 1935, and the installation of laptop computers in 1997.Ted Usher, "A Brief History of the New Westminster Police," Retrieved 4 July 2007.

[[Short ribs]]
CATEGORIES: Cuts of beef

Short ribs  (UK cut: Thin Rib) (Commonly known in UK as   'Jacob's Ladder' ) are a popular cut of beef.  Beef short ribs are larger and usually more tender and meatier than their pork counterpart, pork spare ribs.  Short ribs are cut from the rib and plate primals and a small corner of the square-cut chuck.[tpl]Cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | authorlink = Leah A. Zeldes | title = Eat this! Short ribs, beefy bones for braising | work = Dining Chicago | publisher = Chicago's Restaurant & Entertainment Guide, Inc.  | date = 2011-01-05 | url =http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2011/01/05/eat-this-short-ribs-beefy-bones-for-braising/ | accessdate = 2011-05-18 [/tpl]
A full slab of short ribs is typically about 10 inches square, ranges from 3-5 inches thick, and contains three or four ribs, intercostal muscles and tendon, and a layer of boneless meat and fat which is thick on one end of the slab and thin on the other. There are numerous ways to butcher short ribs. The ribs can be separated and cut into short lengths (typically about 2 inches long), called an "English cut"; "flanken cut" across the bones (typically about 1/2 inch thick); or cut into boneless steaks. However, these boneless steaks are not to be confused with "boneless country-style short ribs," a cut recently introduced in the United States as a cheaper alternative to rib steak, which are not ribs but cut from the chuck eye roll.[tpl]cite web|title=Boneless Country-Style Ribs Fact Sheet|url=http://www.beefitswhatsfordinner.com/CMDocs/BIWFD/FactSheets/Boneless_Country_Style_Ribs.pdf|work=Beef. It's What's for Dinner|accessdate=2 January 2014|author=Cattlemen's Beef Board & National Cattlemen's Beef Association[/tpl]
In Korea, short lengths of rib are often further butchered by butterflying (or using an accordion cut) to unfurl the meat into a long ribbon trailing from the bone, or the meat can be removed from the bone entirely and cut into thin (1/4-1/8 inch thick) slices.
Short ribs may be long-cooked, as in pot-au-feu, a classic of French cuisine, or rapidly seared or grilled, as in Korean cuisine, in which short ribs (called galbi) are marinated and grilled over charcoal. Long-cooking thinner, shorter cuts are also a Korean favorite. A specific type from Hawaii is known as Maui-style ribs. Flanken is a traditional Eastern European Jewish dish, and the origin of that name for short ribs cut across the bone.  Flanken are boiled in broth with onions and other seasonings, until the meat is very tender and the broth is rich, and served with grated horseradish.  Other popular preparations are barbecue and braising. A highly regarded recent method is to cook them sous-vide for up to 72 hours.

CATEGORIES: Mosses, Plant physiology

A leptoid is a type of elongated food-conducting cell in the stems of some mosses, such as the family Polytrichaceae. They surround strands of water-conducting hydroids. They have some structural and developmental similarities to the sieve elements of seedless vascular plants. At maturity they have inclined end cell walls with small pores and degenerate nuclei. The conduction cells of mosses, leptoids and hydroids, appear similar to those of fossil protracheophytes. However they are not thought to represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of plant vascular tissues but to have had an independent evolutionary origin.Renzaglia,K.S., Schette, S. and Duff, R.J.

Working mostly in acrylic on canvas, Agbee focuses almost exclusively on the subject of African women, usually in profile, often drawing on two different motifs for their depiction. Some works, such as Wait A Minute, show them talking in groups, and are characterized by intricate detail of symbols embedded in their clothing or the canvas background. Others, such as Migration, feature the dark, clean profiles of these women on backgrounds of colorful, geometric shapes, somewhat evocative of sand dunes.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Agbee has participated in several collective and individual exhibitions in Accra, other locations in Ghana, the Netherlands, the United States, New Zealand and other locations internationally.

[[Vent (radio series)]]
CATEGORIES: BBC Radio comedy programmes, BBC Radio 4 programmes, 2006 radio programme debuts

Vent is a dark comedy series produced for BBC Radio 4 in 2006.  It is written by Nigel Smith.  The producer is Gareth Edwards.
The story revolves around an unsuccessful writer named Ben Smith (Neil Pearson), who is in a coma.  While his wife Mary (Fiona Allen) and his mother (Josie Lawrence) hash out their emotional issues at his bedside, he lives in a fantasy world with his 2-year-old daughter "Blitzkrieg" (real name Beatrice; Leslie Ash), miraculously grown up, and remembers incidents from his life.  An imaginary sitcom, apparently written by Ben and concerning a coma ward in a hospital, plays in the background.
A second series of 6 episodes began broadcasting on BBC Radio 4 on 25 September 2007.  A third series describing Ben's return home, still clinging to his fantasy life, began broadcasting on BBC Radio 4 on 24 November 2009.
While the flashbacks in the first series concern Ben and Mary's courtship, pursued somewhat reluctantly on Mary's part, the second series shows the slow process of recovery for Ben in parallel with their marriage, her pregnancy, and Ben's lapses of commitment.  Ben's fantasy life revolves around him giving up total control of his fantasy world before returning to a real world where he has no control at all.
The third series was preceded by an interlude episode broadcast as the Friday Play on 20 November.  In this episode Ben is out of his coma but is suffering from locked-in syndrome.  He still experiences memories and fantasies while his wife and mother try to communicate with him.  Meanwhile the hospital authorities are considering whether to continue with rehabilitation or ship him to a care home.
Writer Nigel Smith spent some time in a coma himself, later describing it in an article in The Times [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article684763.ece|title=Me, die?

As the head of the Western Canada Society to Access Justice he was instrumental in setting up numerous pro-bono clinics across western Canada. He charged extremely low fees, and his net income in the years 1991 to 1999 did not exceed $30,000 per year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc21/2007scc21.html |title=British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Christie, 2007 SCC 21 |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2007-05-25 |publisher=Supreme Court of Canada[/tpl]  
Christie is most noteworthy for a 2005 court challenge of a British Columbia law that extended provincial sales tax to legal services. Christie argued that the law unjustly infringed on the constitutionally-protected rights of low income people to access the justice system.  He met with partial success at the Court of Appeal,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/ca/05/06/2005bcca0631.htm |title=2005 BCCA 631 Christie v.

In 2006 Christie began an effort to bicycle across Canada in order to raise awareness of the shortcomings of legal assistance programs in Canada. On July 31, 2006 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Christie was killed when he was hit by a van during his trip.[ref][tpl]cite news |title=B.C. legal crusader killed in cycling accident |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/08/01/bc-lawyer.html |work=CBC News |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-08-01 |accessdate=2007-05-25[/tpl]

[[Center console (automobile)]]

CATEGORIES: Automotive body parts

The center console (British English: centre console) in an automobile refers to the control-bearing surfaces in the center of the front of the vehicle interior. The term is applied to the area beginning in the dashboard and continuing beneath it, and often merging with the transmission tunnel which runs between the front driver's and passenger's seats of many vehicles.
Traditionally, vehicles with a gear stick have placed this control where the two areas of console and tunnel merge, or at the rear-most end of the console in front-wheel-drive vehicles without transmission tunnels. In some modern vehicles – particularly vans – the gear stick is mounted in the front, more vertical part of the center console to be within better reach of the driver without requiring a long stalk mounted on the steering column.
Increasingly, center consoles include a wide variety of storage compartments and cupholders, some of them with refrigerator,Ford Flex Platinum Edition, available second row refrigerated console in addition to the more traditional use as purely a surface for instrumentation (i.e. outside temperature display) and controls (car audio).

Member clubs make selections based on the reverse order of the previous year's standings, with the team with the worst record being awarded the first selection. The draft is held once every year, approximately two months prior to the start of the upcoming season. Beginning in 2014, CIS players will become eligible for the Canadian College Draft three years after completing their first year of eligibility at university. Additionally, NCAA and NAIA players are eligible to be selected after completing their senior season of eligibility.CFL adjusts eligibility rules for Draft Prior to this change, all players would become eligible four years after first attending a post-secondary institution, leading many players to return to school after being drafted.Everything to know about the quirky CFL draft University and college players are not permitted to enter the league without being subject to the draft and players are only eligible to be drafted once.Draft History

CATEGORIES: United States House of Representatives elections in Nebraska, United States House of Representatives elections, 2006, Nebraska elections, 2006

[tpl]ushr|Nebraska|3|[/tpl] covers most of western Nebraska, comprises 69 counties and is considered to be a traditional Republican stronghold. In the 2006 midterm elections, Republican incumbent Tom Osborne did not seek re-election, instead making a failed bid for the Nebraska gubernatorial nomination. In his stead, Republican Adrian Smith who won the Republican primary with 39% of the vote in a field of five candidates defeated Democratic nominee Scott Kleeb 55% to 45%. This ten-point margin was the closest election in the 3rd District since 1990, prompting both candidates to receive a variety of endorsements during the race.
Approximately one-third of the funding of his campaign came from members of the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group that supports tax cuts, limited government, and school choice, and advocates eliminating all agricultural subsidies and the elimination of the US Department of Agriculture.[ref]
</ref>
For a time, Smith was presumed to be a prohibitive favorite in this overwhelmingly Republican district. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the nation; presidential and statewide candidates routinely win it with 70 percent or more of the vote.  The 3rd is extremely difficult to campaign in and has few unifying influences.  It covers nearly [tpl]convert|65000|sqmi|km2[/tpl], two time zones, and 68.5 of Nebraska’s 93 counties (one of which, Cherry County, is larger than the entire state of Connecticut). Both Smith and Kleeb raised and spend more money than any prior third district race.  
As the race become more competitive than expected, it received late national attention from the House campaign committees.

President George W. Bush also made an appearance in the district two days before the election to campaign for Smith—a sign that the national party was very concerned about its chances in what had long been presumed to be a very safe Republican seat.
[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]</ref>
In the end, Smith won by 10 percentage points, taking 55 percent of the vote to Kleeb's 45 percent.
[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]</ref>

Toward the end of the campaign, controversy surrounded a series of automated telephone calls to voters. These calls used an unauthorized recording of Kleeb's voice which allegedly distorted his views, and were often made in the middle of the night. Investigations were made to determine the  source of these calls, which The New York Times claimed "sabotaged" Kleeb's campaign.  After thorough investigation by the Nebraska Public Service Commission the complaint file has been closed with no wrongdoing found either by the Kleeb vendor of robocalls, political candidates or their committees.

Since the 2006 election, Adrian Smith has won re-election in the 3rd District with at least 70% of the vote each time.  He was elected with 77% of the vote in 2008, 70% in 2010, and 74% in 2012.Our Campaigns - NE - District 03 Race - November 6, 2012

Poling or Rapping is the practice of hitting a horse on the legs as it goes over a jump, to make it think it hit the fence hard (due to the pain), so the animal will pick his legs up higher the next time. It is usually performed using a long bamboo stick, which is smacked on the cannon bones of the horse. 
Poling is illegal under FÉI rules, as well as under many national rules."CA PENAL § 597g", 1951, "http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stuscacalpencode597g.htm", 09/13/10 Show jumpers and hunt seat competitors were the most common users of this technique, as a rail down is often a deciding factor in winning a class.

Wildcat is the name of a wooden roller coaster located at Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut. It was built in 1927 and is the park's centerpiece. It is one of the world's oldest operating roller coasters (in operation at the same location). With a first drop of only 73 feet, it's not too intense making it popular with younger guests. The entire structure was rebuilt with new wood in 1985, and the last bunny hills were retracked in 2004.  The Wildcat went down for refurbishment on September 17, 2006 and reopened for the 2007 operating season. During its refurbishment, the brake runs were completely removed and rebuilt with new magnetic brakes. The station also received air gates in the queue line and individual seat belts were added to each seat. The ride was retracked by Martin & Vleminckx.[tpl]cite web|title=Retracking|url=http://www.martin-vleminckx.com/mva_web_3_027.htm|publisher=Martin & Vleminckx|accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl] The Wildcat's trains were built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company.

Route 14 was a proposed state highway through Morris, Passaic and Bergen Counties in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The plans called for a freeway extending from Route 23 in Butler, across the state to Bergen County, where it would cross over a new Hudson River crossing near Alpine. From there, the highway continue as an extension of the  Cross County Parkway in Yonkers, New York.  The proposal was submitted to the Federal Highway Administration for possible interstate status in 1970, but opposition from Bergen and Westchester County residents along with the engineering difficulties involved with building the proposed Hudson River near the New Jersey Palisades crossing prevented the freeway from being built.

The Treaty of Hellgate was signed in Hellgate on July 16, 1855 between Indian commissioner Isaac Stevens and the Native American tribes located in western Montana. The treaty was ratified by Congress, signed by President James Buchanan, and proclaimed on April 18, 1859.[tpl]cite book |last= Prucha |first= Francis Paul |title= American Indian Treaties: The History of a Political Anomaly |year= 1994 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn= 0-520-20895-1[/tpl]
The tribes involved in the signing of the treaty entailed the Bitteroot Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and the Kootenai. The tribes negotiated the Hellgate treaty with the United States in 1855.  From the start, treaty negotiations were plagued by serious translation problems.  A Jesuit observer, Father Adrian Hoecken, said that the translations were so poor that "not a tenth of what was said was understood by either side".  But as in the meeting with Lewis and Clark, the pervasive cross-cultural miscommunication ran even deeper than problems of language and translation. Tribal people came to the meeting assuming they were going to formalize an already-recognized friendship.  Non-Indians came with the goal of making official their claims to native lands and resources.  Isaac Stevens, the new governor and superintendent of Indian affairs for Washington Territory, was intent on obtaining cession of the Bitterroot Valley from the Salish.  Many non-Indians were already well aware of the valley's potential value for agriculture and its relatively temperate climate in winter.  Due to the resistance of Chief Victor (Many Horses), Stevens ended up inserting into the treaty complicated (and doubtless poorly translated) language that defined the Bitterroot Valley south of Lolo Creek as a "conditional reservation" for the Salish.  Victor put his X mark on the document, convinced that the agreement would not require his people to leave their homeland.  No other word came from the government for the next fifteen years, so the Salish assumed that they would indeed stay in their Bitterroot Valley forever.  
Based on the terms of the accord, the Native Americans were to relinquish their territories to the United States government in exchange for payment installments that totaled $120,000 dollars. The territories in question entailed everything from the main ridge of the Rocky Mountains at the 49th parallel to the Kootenai River and Clark Fork to the divide between the St. Regis River and the Coeur d'Alene River. From there, the ceded territories also extend to the southwestern fork of the Bitterroot River and up to Salmon River and Snake River. The treaty was ratified on March 8, 1859.

Odd Rods was a group of non-sports trading card/sticker series created by the Donruss company beginning in 1969. The original series, entitled Odd Rods, introduced the theme of the series in 44 stickers: Monsters in cars. Done by cartoonist/illustrator/writer B.K. Taylor in a style clearly influenced by the work of Ed "Big Daddy" Rothhttp://www.oddrods.com/history.html, the series proved very popular with schoolchildren of the time, resulting in a string of sequel series:
A related sticker series put out by Donruss in this era was Silly Cycles (66 stickers) with monsters on motorcycles. Another series was Fiends and Machines (66 stickers) which had a mix-and-match theme: 33 cards with monsters on top, and 33 with cars on the bottom, allowing the collector to put the 33 monsters on any of the 33 cars.
In 1980, Topps made a series similar to Odd Rods titled Weird Wheels.
In 2006, the Odd Rods trademark and artwork was acquired and the mark registered with the US Trademark Office. The official Odd Rods website is now active.

M cells (or microfold cells) are cells found in the follicle-associated epithelium of the Peyer's patch as well as in BALT (Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue). They transport organisms and particles from the gut lumen to immune cells across the epithelial barrier, and thus are important in stimulating mucosal immunity.
Unlike their neighbouring cells, they have the unique ability to take up antigen from the lumen of the small intestine via endocytosis or phagocytosis, and then deliver it via transcytosis to dendritic cells (an antigen presenting cell) and lymphocytes (namely T cells) located in a unique pocket-like structure on their basolateral side.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

[[Sialyltransferase]]
CATEGORIES: Transferases, EC 2.4

 
Sialyltransferases are enzymes that transfer sialic acid to nascent oligosaccharide.Harduin-Lepers A, Vallejo-Ruiz V, Krzewinski-Recchi MA, Samyn-Petit B, Julien S, Delannoy P.The human sialyltransferase family.Biochimie. 2001 Aug;83(8):727-37Each sialyltransferase is specific for a particular sugar substrate. Sialyltransferases add sialic acid to the terminal portions of the sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) or to the N- or O-linked sugar chains of glycoproteins. 
The biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases. These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([tpl]EC number|2.4.1.-[/tpl]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described.[tpl]cite journal |author=Henrissat B, Davies GJ, Campbell JA, Bulone V |title=A classification of nucleotide-diphospho-sugar glycosyltransferases based on amino acid sequence similarities |journal=Biochem. J. |volume=326 |issue= |pages=929–939 |year=1997 |pmid=9334165 |pmc=1218753[/tpl] This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site.[tpl]cite journal |author=Henrissat B, Coutinho PM |title=Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes server |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=- |year=1999[/tpl] The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.
Sialyltransferases belong to glycosyltransferase family 29 (CAZY GT_29) which comprises enzymes with a number of known activities; sialyltransferase ([tpl]EC number|2.4.99[/tpl]), beta-galactosamide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase ([tpl]EC number|2.4.99.1[/tpl]), alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase ([tpl]EC number|2.4.99.3[/tpl]), beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase ([tpl]EC number|2.4.99.4[/tpl]), N-acetyllactosaminide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase ([tpl]EC number|2.4.99.6[/tpl]), alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase ([tpl]EC number|2.4.99.8[/tpl]); lactosylceramide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase ([tpl]EC number|2.4.99.9[/tpl]). These enzymes use a nucleotide monophosphosugar as the donor (CMP-NeuA) instead of a nucleotide diphosphosugar. 
Sialyltransferase may be responsible for the synthesis of the sequence NEUAC-Alpha-2,3-GAL-Beta-1,3-GALNAC-, found on sugar chains O-linked to thr or ser and also as a terminal sequenec on certain gagnliosides. These enzymes catalyse sialyltransfer reactions during glycosylation, and are type II membrane proteins.
There are about twenty different sialyltransferases which can be distinguished on the basis of the acceptor structure on which they act and on the type of sugar linkage they form. For example, a group of sialyltransferases adds sialic acid with an alpha-2,3 linkage to galactose, while other sialyltransferases add sialic acid with an alpha-2,6 linkage to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine. A peculiar type of sialyltransferases add sialic acid to other sialic acid units with an alpha-2,8 linkage, forming structures referred to as polysialic acid. As occurs for other glycosyltransferases, the expression of sialyltransferases undergoes profound modifications during cell differentiation and neoplastic transformation; in some cases such changes induce phenotypic alterations.Dall'Olio and Chiricolo, Glycoconjugate J. 18 841-850, 2001

Santisima Trinidad was a location on the northeast coast of Taiwan at Keelung, where in 1626 the Spanish established a settlement and built Fort San Salvador, which they occupied until 1642 when they were driven out by the Dutch. The Dutch re-shaped the Spanish fort, reduced its size and renamed it Fort Noort-Holland.
In 1661, when Koxinga, a Ming China loyalist, with 400 warships and 25,000 men laid siege to the main Dutch fortress (Zeelandia in Anping), defended by 2,000 Dutch soldiers, the Dutch left their fort in Keelung, when it became clear that no reinforcements were forthcoming from Zeelandia or Batavia (present day Jakarta, Indonesia).
In 1663, the Dutch returned to Keelung, retook the fort, strengthened and enlarged it and kept it until 1668, when they voluntarily gave it up, as the trade in Keelung was not what they expected it to be.

[[Peter Brugger]]
CATEGORIES: Swiss neuroscientists, Living people

Swiss neuroscientist Peter Brugger of the University Hospital in Zürich has come up with a new theory on "ghosts" and "doppelgängers". (A doppelgänger is the ghost of a living person, usually the viewer.) Brugger, whose idea is detailed in an upcoming edition of New Scientist magazine, thinks the viewer is experiencing a "phantom of the entire body" just in the same way an amputee might experience a "phantom limb". The limb is no longer there, but the brain still tells the amputee it is. Brain damage can cause this effect, but people with normal brains may have the effect triggered by intense emotions such as fear, sadness, or euphoria. Brugger reports that mountain climbers who have experienced oxygen deprivation at about [tpl]convert|27000|ft[/tpl] have reported feeling a "presence" or having an out-of-body experience.
In September 2005, a team of mainly Swiss neuroscientists, including Brugger, reported the finding that they could trigger out-of-body experiences in subjects by stimulating a part of the brain.

[[Nut graph]]

CATEGORIES: Journalism terminology

In journalism, a nut graph is a paragraph, particularly in a feature story, that explains the news value of the story.  The term is also spelled as nut graf, nut 'graph, nutgraph, nutgraf. It is a contraction of the expression nutshell paragraph, i.e., "in a nutshell" paragraph, dated at least to the 19th century. Sometimes the expression nut paragraph is also used. Writing a nut graph is called nutshelling and the writers are called nutshellers.
In most news stories, the news style of writing is used, and the essential facts of a story are included in the lede, the first sentence or two of the story.  For example, a story about crime statistics written in news style might start out with a lede like: "Violent crime is down in Anytown, but shoplifting is soaring, according to statistics released by the Anytown Police Department Tuesday." Good ledes try to answer who, what, when, where, why, and how as quickly as possible.[tpl]fact|date=November 2012[/tpl]
However, in feature stories, or in news written in a feature style, the story will often begin in a more narrative manner.  For instance, if a story on crime statistics were written in feature style rather than news style, the first few paragraphs might start by introducing a local business owner who was affected by the boom in shoplifting.[tpl]fact|date=November 2012[/tpl]  The nut graf, which often will start in the third or fourth paragraph, will explain what the story is about, including much but rarely all of the information that would have been contained in a lede, so as to keep the reader interested.

[[The Greencards]]
CATEGORIES: American bluegrass music groups, Musical groups from Austin, Texas, Musical groups established in 2003, American country music groups, 2003 establishments in Texas

The Greencards are a progressive bluegrass band that formed in Austin, Texas, and are currently based in Nashville, Tennessee. The band was founded in 2003 in Texas by Eamon McLoughlin, an Englishman, and Australians Kym Warner and Carol Young. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, Movin' On, in 2003, and two albums, Weather and Water, and Viridian, on the Dualtone record label. Their fourth album, Fascination, was released on Sugar Hill in 2009.  Their fifth album, "Brick", 2011, was self-produced with the direct support of their fans.  Pre-production donors were recognized with their names inscribed on the "bricks" that make-up the cover art.
Their debut album, Movin' On, was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on Americana radio stations. Country Music Television named their follow-up Weather and Water as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson in the same year. Viridian would go on to take the number one position on the Billboard magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart, making The Greencards the first international band to ever do so. Viridian was a critically praised album, and was nominated for Best Country Album by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The track "Mucky the Duck" from Viridian was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 50th Grammy Awards.
The Greencards are noted for their playing of American bluegrass with a worldly feel, and for their incorporation of other genres of music. Often labeled as part of, and said to be representative of, the "newgrass" movement, they draw from Irish folk music, gypsy music, rock 'n' roll, folk balladry, and Latin American musical sources. The Greencards' sound has been compared to progressive American folk rock, and they have been credited with helping to expand bluegrass music.
Eamon McLoughlin left the band in December 2009, and currently resides in Nashville TN. He was replaced by Tyler Andal, a fiddle player from White House, TN.  Carl Miner, originally from Oregon, joined the group in May 2010, playing acoustic guitar.  Carl won the 1999 National Flatpicking Championship at the Walnut Valley Festival, and currently resides in Nashville, TN.

CATEGORIES: Rockefeller Center, Office buildings in Manhattan, Skyscrapers in Manhattan, ExxonMobil buildings and structures

The Exxon Building, more widely known by its address, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, was part of the later Rockefeller Center expansion (1960s-1970s) dubbed the "XYZ Buildings" on Sixth Avenue (also known as Avenue of the Americas) in Manhattan. Their plans were first drawn in 1963 by The Rockefeller family's architect, Wallace Harrison of the architectural firm, Harrison and Abramovitz.
Their letters correspond to their height. 1251 is the "X" Building as it is the tallest at 750 ft (229 m) and 54 stories, but was the second one completed (1971). The "Y" is the McGraw-Hill Building, at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, which was the first completed (1969) and is the second in height (674 ft - 51 stories). The "Z" Building, the shortest and the youngest, is the Celanese Building at 1211 Avenue of the Americas with 45 stories (592 ft).
1251 is the second-tallest building in the whole of Rockefeller Center, after the GE Building.
Despite being one of the 100 tallest buildings in the United States, 1251 Avenue of the Americas is all but impossible to see from more than just a few blocks away as it is flanked on all sides by buildings over 500 feet tall. The result is that even though 1251 Avenue of the Americas is approximately as tall as the tallest buildings in cities like Boston or Minneapolis, it has almost no presence on the New York City skyline. 
ExxonMobil Corporation subsequently moved its headquarters to Irving in Texas, and its New York offices to Brooklyn; it no longer retains a presence in Rockefeller Center.[tpl]Fact|date=January 2009[/tpl]
Inside, on the western end of 1251's atrium hangs an artist-authorized replica of a tapestry Pablo Picasso created for the ballet Mercure, the original of which hangs in the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris, France. It was created specifically for 1251, as per the plaque beneath it.

[[Latin Mass Society of Australia]]

CATEGORIES: Catholic traditionalism

Latin Mass Society of Australia is an organisation currently led primarily by Romans Catholics adhering to the positions of the international Society of St. Pius X. The Latin Mass Society of Australia was founded in Sydney in the early 1970s by a group of Catholics who were dissatisfied with the changes to the rite of the Catholic Mass---both the fact that it was no longer in Latin, and also changes to the traditional Tridentine rite itself, which to them denoted huge symbolic alterations. For instance, that the priest now faced the congregation rather than standing in front of the altar (seen as turning away from worshipping God towards addressing people); that the altar was more and more like a table (this was seen as denigrating the sacrificial nature of the Mass) and letting people touch the Host at Communion (seen as a kind of blasphemy—only the priest's consecrated hands should touch it). People saw this as a creeping Protestantism[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl].
Many people in the LMS were also upset by other changes to the Church generally, since Vatican II in the 1960s. A few—and it must be stressed, a few - did not like, for instance, the fact that the Church absolved the Jews of 33 AD of any complicity, direct or otherwise, in the death of Christ[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]. Most people in the LMS accepted the authority of the Pope, but believed he was in error; others, like Hutton Gibson, came to believe the Popes since at least John XXIII were not 'real Popes' but heretical usurpers, and that the 'chair of St Peter' had been vacant since then. The latter position is known as sedevacantism [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl].
Reactions to the LMS from the 'official' Church as it became known to LMS members, were pretty strong. Some very heavy-handed tactics were assumed; banning parish priests from allowing their churches to have Latin Masses celebrated in them (this resulted in the Sydney branch holding its weekly Mass in the East Lindfield Community Hall), banning priests and denying them their pensions, such as the LMS' officiating priest, Father Patrick Fox, not only from celebrating Mass, but removing him from all duties, and constantly accusing LMs members of being 'heretics'. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] The reactions of the LMS to the hierarchy of the modern Church were equally heavy-handed, and the LMs was driven further and further from the 'bosom of the Church.'

He studied the Calotype process, and in 1847 became the first person to publish the process in France. He developed a method of bathing the paper in solutions of potassium iodide and silver nitrate rather than brushing these chemical baths on the surface.
In 1850, he developed and introduced the albumen paper printing technique, which became the staple process of the soon to be popular Carte de visite.Louis-desire Blanquart-evrard (1802-1872) Artwork Images, Exhibitions, Reviews In 1851 in Lille, France, with Hippolyte Fockedey, he started the Imprimerie Photographique, which was the first large scale printing company to employ a large number of employees. In the 1850s he was known for publishing other artists works, including John Stewart's views of the Pyrenees and Auguste Saltzmann's views of Jerusalem. His process for the calotype had the disadvantage of leaving a blank white sky and dark foreground, which led to artist manipulating and using multiple negatives to add clouds to the sky and make the foreground more distinct.  The problem with these manipulations was that often the clouds were taken in the morning and the foreground was taken in the afternoon.

[[Mohamed Sillah]]

CATEGORIES: Year of birth missing (living people), National Alliance Democratic Party politicians, Living people

Mohamed Yahya Sillah was born December 12, 1949 in Massam Kpaka, Pujehun District, Republic of Sierra Leone. His father, Alhaji Yahya Sillah, now 100 years old, served as Regent Chief (Acting Paramount Chief) for several years in Dama Chiefdom, Kenema District in the early seventies. Alhaji Yahya Sillah was appointed to that high position by Sierra Leone President Siaka Stevens. His mother, Haja Mamie Zoe Mansaray, was a home maker.  A journalist and human rights activist, Mohamed Yahya Sillah was a vocal torch-bearer in the transition efforts from military to civilian rule in Sierra Leone, 1996. As Leader and National Chairman of National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP), he competed the 1996 Presidential elections in Sierra Leone, becoming one of only thirteen political leaders that qualified to contest the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in the country at the age of 46. His adoring personality lured many Sierra Leoneans and media practitioners to view him as one of the most eloquent and charismatic politicians in Sierra Leone. Nevertheless, he received only 0.5% of the votes (3,723 total votes), good for 13th place. Although he protested the election results on BBC's Focus on Africa, he later suspended his protest "for the sake of peace." Mohamed Yahya Sillah continues to enjoy massive support from the youth and women supporters in Sierra Leone. In 2007, he withdrew his bid for natioal leadership in the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, citing inadequate funding and ineffective campaign management machinery. He later put his weight behind the Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP) presidential candidate, Vice President Solomon Berewa. When Berewa lost the elections, Mohamed Yahya Sillah gracefully congratulated the winning candidate, Ernest Bai Koroma, of the All People's Congress (APC) party. Mohamed Yahya Sillah vows to respect and help protect the dignity of any Sierra Leonean that is legitimately and democratically elected to office by the people of Sierra Leone.
EFFORTS MADE BY MOHAMED YAHYA SILLAH FOR HIS COUNTRY AND HIS PEOPLE:
Before he entered politics in 1995, Mohamed Yahya Sillah was a human rights activist and humanitarian. In 1990, Mohamed Yahya Sillah came to the aid of thousands of stranded Sierra Leoneans and non-Sierra Leoneans in Liberia when that country was gobbled up by one of Africa’s bloodiest civil wars. During that period, thousands of Sierra Leoneans and foreign residents in Liberia stranded when the warring factions, made up of rebels and government soldiers, blocked all land and sea exits from Liberia. The move made it practically impossible for anyone to escape the onslaught of the rebel war. The Sierra Leone Embassy in Monrovia shut down, and the Sierra Leone government, then under president Joseph Saidu Momoh (APC), declared incapacity to rescue the stranded Sierra Leoneans. Mohamed Yahya Sillah was visiting Liberia at the time to cover the war as a journalist for his Atlanta based African World News magazine which he founded in 1983. Sillah faced the agony of a war that the rebels fought using supernatural means to enhance their warring gallantry. He recorded accounts of rebels drinking human blood from freshly slaughtered civilians as baits to endow their prowess to kill without mercy. Inside the grounds of the Sierra Leone Embassy in Monrovia, there were nearly five hundred stranded Sierra Leoneans, including children that hungered and thirsted because there were no food or sanitized drinking water. Mohamed Yahya Sillah and other concerned Sierra Leoneans that were refugees took charge of leadership at the Embassy.
However, as the refugees looked up to Sillah for leadership and direction, he took an intrepid but decisive action to save his fellow citizens by unilaterally accosting the rebels to lure them bring food for money to feed the hungry women and children. He succeeded in letting rebels sell bags of rice which he purchased and distributed free to all refugees at the Embassy. As assault on the Embassy intensified, Sillah decided to risk a rescue of all Sierra Leoneans and non-Sierra Leoneans from the Embassy to the safety of ECOMOG soldiers at Monrovia’s Freeport facility. He did so by paying combatant factions with his own money to facilitate passage through ambush points along the way. He succeeded at evacuating all refugees by help of ECOMOG soldiers in less than one hour before a missile, launched by rebel forces, destroyed the Embassy. At the Freeport, Sillah created what he called the Sierra Leone Evacuation Organization. Through that organization Mohamed Yahya Sillah evacuated five thousand Sierra Leoneans and non-Sierra Leoneans to Freetown over a period of ninety days through the Nigerian gun boat called The Ambe. Refugees and observers nicknamed Mohamed Yahya Sillah Junior Moses  .
Mohamed Yahya Sillah’s efforts attract the attention of American diplomats in Monrovia. In 1995, Mohamed Yahya Sillah and his US political Campaign Manager, Robert L. Herman (deceased), traveled to Brussels, Belgium on un-official visit with the American Ambassador to the European Union, Stuart Eizenstat.  In Brussels, he met with Ernest J. Fischer, 11, the US Consul at the American Embassy in Brussels. That Consul later was identified as a former Senior American Embassy official in Monrovia during the period Sillah evacuated Sierra Leoneans to safety. The Consul praised Sillah for his "fearless efforts to show leadership for your people at a time of crisis.”  The American diplomat issued a statement documenting his impressions of Mohamed Yahya's Sillah’s efforts in Liberia.
MOHAMED YAHYA SILLAH TO THE RESCUE OF SIERRA LEONEANS IN THE US:
In 2004, Mohamed Yahya Sillah embarked on another mission to save thousands of Sierra Leoneans from deportation from the United States after the US withdrew their protective privilege known as Temporary Protective Status (TPS). In September that year, Mohamed Yahya Sillah made a solemn appeal to the government of the United States of America not to deport Sierra Leonean nationals resident in the United States under the immigration’s Temporary Protective Status (TPS). In a meeting at the office of Georgia Congressman, Honorable John Lewis, at the Cannon House Building in Washington, DC, Mohamed Yahya Sillah told officials that although atrocities of a ten-year war in Sierra Leone seemed to have lapsed, conditions still remained volatile for Sierra Leoneans that escaped agonies of the war. “Sierra Leoneans would like to return home someday,” Sillah said, adding, however, that "Sierra Leone still posed an environment that was not conducive to accommodating the hundreds of thousands of Sierra Leoneans that were refugees and asylum seekers all over the world." In a communication to Congressman John Lewis, Sillah commended the United States government for graciously providing the Temporary Protective Status (TPS) to Sierra Leoneans that entered the U. S. as escapees from agonies of the war. He then appealed to the congressman to use the power of his office to intervene on behalf of the Sierra Leoneans that were threatened with deportation as a result of the TPS withdrawal.
Responding to the concerns raised by Mr. Sillah, Jessica Battaglia, Senior Policy Advisor to Congressman John Lewis, said that through Hon Lewis, the Georgia Congressional Office would forward a request to the Secretary of Homeland Security to reconsider the TPS issue for Sierra Leoneans. Later, the Georgia Congressman made a personal telephone call on Mohamed Yahya Sillah to reassure him of his interest in the TPS issue. Mohamed Yahya Sillah's efforts led to a TPS reprieve for Sierra Leonean refugees in the United States in 2004.
MOHAMED YAHYA SILLAH FIGHTING FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF JOURNALISTS IN SIERRA LEONE:
In 2004, Mohamed Yahya Sillah, as Leader of The National Alliance Democratic Party of Sierra Leone (NADP), followed with keen interest developments surrounding the imprisonment of a prominent Sierra Leonean journalist, Paul Kamara, editor of For DI People Newspaper, on October 5, 2004. Mohamed Yahya Sillah viewed Mr. Kamara’s imprisonment and the subsequent banning of his newspaper as a serious breach of the SLPP government’s commitment to press freedom and the constitutional exercise of free speech in the country. Mohamed Yahya Sillah feared that the court’s action against Mr. Kamara ratified the government’s power to continue stifling the development and progress of serious democratic institutions in Sierra Leone. Mohamed Yahya Sillah took a strong position against the President of Sierra Leone, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, that Mr. Kamara’s case with the President of Sierra Leone never should have led Mr. Kamara to jail. "The President of Sierra Leone," said Sillah, "is a public figure. In my opinion and that of the National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP), it is unconscionable for a national leader to take his own citizen to court to defend the leader’s reputation. I believe that a national leader’s reputation is better protected or venerated by the leader’s own capability to demonstrate exemplary leadership for the peace, happiness and security of the people the leader takes the oath to lead," Sillah said. Mohamed Yahya Sillah said it was a travesty of justice against the people of Sierra Leone for any leader or group of leaders to use their political powers as a potent weapon to settle old scores. "It is time our national leaders, both in the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary branches of government began to consider themselves as public servants rather than public celebrities," Sillah told the President. "Please let Mr. Kamara go! Jailing Paul Kamara and shutting down his newspaper will not scotch journalists from investigating and reporting on the imperfections of our leaders or the ineptitude of their governments," Sillah said. Mohamed Yahya Sillah reminded the President that well-meaning Sierra Leoneans both inside and outside of the country worked hard in 1996 to usher in a democratic system of governance that they felt could set the people of Sierra Leone free. Mohamed Yahya Sillah said that the exercise of democracy and the protection of human rights in Sierra Leone were fundamentals that must be consistent with the free exercise of conscience and the people’s basic right to free speech.

[[Mane (horse)]]

CATEGORIES: Horse anatomy, Horse management

The mane is the hair that grows from the top of the neck of a horse or other equine, reaching from the poll to the withers, and includes the forelock or foretop. It is thicker and coarser than the rest of the horse's coat, and naturally grows to roughly cover the neck.  Heredity plays a role, giving some horses a longer, thicker mane, and others a shorter, thinner one.
Some horses, such as those used in circuses or in mounted displays such as Cavalia, have manes allowed to grow down to their knees. Others have their manes deliberately shaved completely off for style or practical purposes.  When ungroomed, however, the mane usually grows no longer than the width of the horse's neck, as natural wear and tear limit its potential length.
The mane is thought to keep the neck warm, and possibly to help water run off the neck if the animal cannot obtain shelter from the rain. It also provides some fly protection to the front of the horse, although the tail is usually the first defense against flies.
Ponies usually have the thickest manes, with horse breeds having tremendous variation in thickness and length.  Other equids such as the donkey often have very sparse, thin manes.

Michael "Mike" Viola (born September 26, 1966)Michael A. Viola 1966 – The Early Years, Ordinary Man, Rainbows, Don't Break My Fall, I Don't Wanna Die A Pizza MakerBirthday: September 26, 1966 is an American singer-songwriter best known as singer, songwriter and "musical architect" of a team he called the "Candy Butchers", a pop-rock band from New York City that recorded three critically acclaimed albums for Sony. A native of Stoughton, Massachusetts, Mike began his musical career in the 1980s. No recordings of his earliest musical work, however, were known to have been officially released as of September 2009. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] His biggest musical influences include The Beatles, Paul McCartney, Roy Orbison, The Beach Boys, Elvis Costello, Randy Newman, Elton John, Big Star, Squeeze (band), Crowded House, Cheap Trick, XTC and Jellyfish (band).
The success of the Candy Butchers in the 1990s led to multiple appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Last Call with Carson Daly. It also found the group touring alongside the likes of Ron Sexsmith, They Might Be Giants, Robyn Hitchcock, Semisonic, Sparklehorse, Barenaked Ladies, and Ivy.
Viola simultaneously began a career in film work as the co-producer and lead singer of the Oscar-nominated title track from Tom Hanks's That Thing You Do!. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, a film collaboration between Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow that starred John C. Reilly as Dewey Cox, featured nearly a dozen songs written by Viola.
Viola joined the ranks of "indie," or independent-record-label artists in 2005 when he released an album of new songs on his own label, Good Morning Monkey Records. Recorded live at Largo in L.A., Just Before Dark showcased Viola's abilities as a live performer. Once made available on his official website, the album, released as a long-playing vinyl album with a CD copy included, sold out in three months.
His album, Lurch, employed classic pop elements, and incorporated storybook imagery, such as Viola’s fans had come to expect by this time in his career. Lurch was also released internationally, with such selections as “Maybe, Maybe Not” (the first selection on the album) and “So Much Better” (the first single Viola released from the album) receiving radio airplay in Denmark. "So Much Better" was a Danish chart selection. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
After signing a contract with EMI Music Publishing for worldwide distribution of his own material, Viola remained a songwriter and/or producer on a multitude of projects. His work could be heard on Amanda Leigh, the most recent of Mandy Moore's albums as of September 2009. In addition to being Moore's musical director, Viola has collaborated with Dan Wilson, Inara George, Tim Christensen, Dan Bern, Steve McEwan, Kelly Jones, Ryan Adams, Drake Bell, Bleu, Adam Schlesinger, John C. Reilly, Mary Wood, Sam Bisbee, The Gentlemen, John Wesley Harding, Ben Romans, and Noam Weinstein during this period.
In 2010, he joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers.
He has taken part in a compilation album released on November 15, 2011 by Engine Room Recordings. On the album Mike covers Round and Round by Ratt.
In 2012 Viola recorded a version of Andrew Gold's "Lonely Boy" for a fund raising cd titled "Super Hits Of The Seventies" for radio station WFMU. He also recorded a cover of The Silver Beatles' version of "Ain't She Sweet" for the pilot of TV show Bunheads.Viola's tumblr blog

CATEGORIES: Radio stations in Detroit, Michigan, Classic hits radio stations in the United States, Livingston County, Michigan, Radio stations established in 1977

WHMI-FM is a radio station broadcasting at 93.5 FM in Howell, Michigan.  The station broadcasts a classic rock hits format with local news, sports, traffic and weather and bills itself as Livingston County's Own 93-5. WHMI is owned by the Livingston Radio Company with Greg Jablonski serving as the President and CEO.
WHMI's signal covers Livingston County, Michigan, including Howell, Brighton, Fowlerville, Hamburg, and Hartland, and reaches the outskirts of the Detroit, Ann Arbor, Flint and Lansing markets. South of Detroit and Ann Arbor, however, WRQN in Bowling Green, Ohio, interferes, as does London, Ontario's CBCL in northern parts of the Detroit area.
WHMI began as an AM radio station at 1350 kHz in 1957. The call letters could be said to stand for both "Howell, Michigan" and "Heart of Michigan", a reference to an ad campaign of the late 1950s which promoted Livingston County as a good place to live.  An FM signal at 93.5 was added in 1977, simulcasting the AM.  Originally, WHMI was a small-town station typical of its era, with adult contemporary/MOR music and a strong news commitment.  
The AM signal, which was inferior to the FM signal, was silenced in 1995. Since then WHMI has been solely on FM. During the late 1990s, WHMI's music programming gradually evolved from hot AC into the current "classic hits" format.
In 2001, WHMI moved out of its longtime studios on Grand River Avenue in Howell into a state-of-the-art facility at 1277 Parkway Drive in Genoa Township, Michigan.

CATEGORIES: Canals in New York, Visitor attractions in Yates County, New York

The Crooked Lake Canal was a former canal in New York, USA.  The canal linked two Finger Lakes: Keuka Lake and Seneca Lake.  The name refers to the unusual shape of Keuka Lake, which was formerly called "Crooked Lake." 
A canal survey was authorized by the state in 1828, and the order to commence construction was issued in 1829.  From 1830 to 1833, the canal and its locks were built along the Keuka Outlet, a natural stream connecting the two lakes. 
The Crooked Lake Canal ran thirteen miles between Dresden on the west shore of Seneca Lake and Penn Yan at the northeast end of Keuka Lake through a system of twenty-eight locks. 
The canal opened in 1833 and was officially abandoned in 1877, its holdings taken over by railroads.  In 1972, the rail line was demolished in Hurricane Agnes.  Later, the land was purchased for recreational use. 
The route is partly marked by the modern Keuka Outlet Trail for hiking and biking.

The fauna of New Guinea comprises a large number of species of mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, invertebrates and amphibians.
As the world’s largest and highest tropical island, New Guinea occupies less than 0.5% of world's land surface, yet supports a high percentage of global biodiversity. Approximately 4,642 vertebrate species inhabit the island of New Guinea and its surrounding waters, which constitutes about 8% of the recognized world vertebrates. This ranges from an estimated 4% of the world's lizards and mammals, to about 10% of the world's fish species.[tpl]cite journal | last = Allison | first = A. | title = Introduction to the Fauna of Papua | pages = in press | year = 2007 |work = The Ecology of Papua, The Ecology of Indonesia Series, Vol. IX[/tpl]
The numbers of global and New Guinea invertebrate species are poorly known, and thus an accurate comparison is difficult. Butterflies are the best known invertebrate group, and are represented in New Guinea by about 735 species, which is about 4.2% of the world total of 17,500 species.

Antun Sorkočević (also Antonio Sorgo) (December 25, 1775 – February 14, 1841), was a diplomat, writer, composer and member of Ragusan nobility (chevalier des odres de Saint Maurice et de Saint Lazare demeurant a Paris). He was Medo Pucić's cousin, and a good friend of Marko Bruerović.
Sorkočević was born in Dubrovnik.  His father was Luka Sorkočević. Like his father he was also composer. Antun studied in Rome, and after 1806 led the Republic of Ragusa's diplomatic representation in Paris where he was the last ambassador of the Republic in France, where he spent 35 years of his life. In Paris he wrote Postanak i propast Republike Dubrovačke (The Rise and Fall of the Republic of Dubrovnik) in which he proposed that Dubrovnik should join Boka Kotorska, Montenegro and Serbia to make it one nation. The pamphlet was banned in Austria. He also put forth the idea of creating a separate region comprising the Republic and Boka Kotorska under the Austrian Empire after French occupation of these lands (Illyrian provinces).
Author of numerous publications, he became a member of Académie Celtique in 1806 and the Société des Antiquaries in 1828. Among other books he published such as Mémoire sur la langue et les moeurs des peuples slaves, Fragments sur l'histoire et la littérature de la République de Raguse et sur la langue slave, Fragmenti o političkoj i književnoj povijesti stare Dubrovačke republike i o slavenskom jeziku. In 1838 he translated Ivan Gundulić's Osman into French and became the author of the earliest  piano sonatas. He died in Paris.
His collection also contains abundant information relevant to the research of the two composers' (Luka and Antun Sorkočević) life and work. Antun wrote four symphonies and numerous pieces for chamber music.

[[Bridle path]]
CATEGORIES: Horse trails, Types of thoroughfares, Trails, Equestrian sports

A bridle path, also bridleway, equestrian trail, horse riding path, bridle road, or horse trail, is a path, trail or a thoroughfare that is used by people riding on horses. Trails originally created for use by horses often now serve a wider range of users, including equestrians, hikers,Old Bridle Path trail in NH White Mountains and cyclists. Such paths are either impassable for motorized vehicles or they are banned. The laws relating to allowable uses vary from country to country.
In industrialized countries, bridle paths are now primarily used for recreation. However, they are still important transportation routes in other areas. For example, they are the main method of traveling to mountain villages in Lesotho."Lesotho." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 24 June 2007 In some areas, bridle paths developed as transport routes where the terrain was so steep that the route was impassable by wheeled wagons and vehicles, as for example, Bridle Path, New Zealand, an early transport route in Christchurch.
However, In England and Wales a bridle path now refers to a route which can be legally used by horse riders in addition to walkers, and since 1968, by cyclists.
In the US, the term bridle path is used colloquially for trails or paths used primarily for people making day treks on horses, and usually used only on the east coast, whereas out west the equivalent term is trail. The term "bridleway" at is rarely used in the USA. Most of the time horses are presumed allowed to use trails in America unless specifically banned, although rules differ among locations.Concord Monitor: "N.H. drops plans to limit horse use of state trails after complaints" 
In some countries long distance multi-use trails have been created, including the Bicentennial National Trail in Australia, one of the longest marked multi-use trails in the world, stretching 5,330 kilometres.Bicentennial National Trail Retrieved 29-11-2013. Rail trails can often be used by equestrians.

[[Phi value analysis]]
CATEGORIES: Protein structure, Protein folding, Protein engineering, Protein methods

Phi value analysis is an experimental protein engineering method used to study the structure of the folding transition state in small protein domains that fold in a two-state manner. Since the folding transition state is by definition a transient and partially unstructured state, its structure is difficult to determine by traditional methods such as protein NMR or X-ray crystallography.  In phi-value analysis, the folding kinetics and conformational folding stability of the wild-type protein are compared with those of one or more point mutants.  This comparison yields a phi value (defined below) that seeks to measure the mutated residue's energetic contribution to the folding transition state (and thus the degree of native structure around the mutated residue in the transition state) from the relative free energies of the unfolded state, the folded state and the transition state for the wild-type and mutant proteins.
Typically, a high fraction of the protein's residues are mutated one by one to identify clusters of residues that are well-ordered in the folded transition state.  The interactions of these residues can be validated using double-mutant-cycle phi analysis, in which the effects of the single mutants are compared with those of the double mutant.  In general, the mutations are conservative and replace the original residue with a smaller one (cavity-creating mutations), most commonly alanine; however, others such as tyrosine-to-phenylalanine, isoleucine-to-valine and threonine-to-serine mutations are also used.  Examples of proteins that have been studied by phi value analysis include chymotrypsin inhibitor, SH3 domains, individual domains of proteins L and G, ubiquitin, and barnase.

Client/Server Runtime Subsystem, or csrss.exe, is a component of the Microsoft Windows NT operating system that provides the user mode side of the Win32 subsystem and is included in Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows 8.  Because most of the Win32 subsystem operations have been moved to kernel mode drivers, in Windows NT 4 and later, CSRSS is mainly responsible for Win32 console handling and GUI shutdown. It is critical to system operation; therefore, terminating this process will result in system failure. Under normal circumstances, CSRSS cannot be terminated with the taskkill command or with Windows Task Manager, although it is possible in Vista if the Task Manager is run in Administrator mode. On Windows 7 and Windows 8 Developer Preview, Task Manager will inform the user that terminating the process will result in system failure, and prompt if they want to continue. Some virus hoax emails claim that csrss.exe is a virus that has been confirmed by Microsoft, and that the user should terminate it immediately. This, obviously, would actually lead to system failure and a blue screen of death.

The Fair Play Men were illegal settlers (squatters) who established their own system of self-rule from 1773 to 1785 in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley of Pennsylvania in what is now the United States. Because they settled in territory claimed by Native Americans, they had no recourse to the Pennsylvania colonial government. Accordingly they established what was known as the Fair Play System, with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own declaration of independence from Britain on July 4, 1776 beneath the "Tiadaghton Elm" on the banks of Pine Creek.

It can also be considered a cantellated 16-cell with the lower symmetries B4 = 3,3,4. B4 would lead to a bicoloring of the cuboctahedral cells into 8 and 16 each. It is also called a runcicantellated demitesseract in a D4 symmetry, giving 3 colors of cells, 8 for each.

Keep Your Right Up ([tpl]lang-fr|Soigne ta droite, ou une place sur la terre[/tpl]) is a 1987 film, written, directed by, and starring French Swiss filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard. 
Soigne ta droite is a phrase from boxing - a trainer's call to "keep your right up". The immediate reference is to Jacques Tati's first short film, Soigne ton gauche (Keep Your Left Up). But this is neither a comedy in the classical sense, nor a film about boxing. Godard describes it as "the camera versus landscapes over 17 rounds". It may also be described as a film which does a two-way travel between sky and earth, between comic and experimental, between shadow and light. With humour and multiplying literary references and citations, Godard question himself on life and thus on death, within his kaleidoscope of images. This engaging film, which mixes genres, goes through the shadowy sky of the history of cinema a luminous way.

[[Amar-Sin]]

Amar-Sin (initially read as Bur-Sin) (ca. 1981–1973 BC short chronology) was the third ruler of the Ur III Dynasty. He succeeded his father Shulgi (ca. 2029–1982 BC).[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ew0dEP6CzEcC&pg=RA3-PA607&lpg=RA3-PA607&dq=bur-sin+amar-sin&source=web&ots=LAe_9C61e8&sig=RRGbQouCvTINIvhW4bmq5xU3U-s&hl=en |title=The Cambridge Ancient History |author=John Bagnell Bury et al. |year=1925 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-07791-5 |page=607[/tpl]
Year-names are known for all 9 years of his reign. These record campaigns conducted against Urbilum, and several other regions with obscure names: Shashrum, Shurudhum, Bitum-Rabium, Jabru, and Huhnuri.Year-names for Amar-Sin Amar-Sin is otherwise known to have campaigned against Elamite rulers such as Arwilukpi of Marhashi, and the Ur Empire under his reign extended as far as the northern provinces of Lullubi and Hamazi, with their own governors. He also suppressed a rebellion in Assur where he appointed an Akkadian governor, Zariqum as confirmed by his monumental inscription.Zariqum does not appear on the Assyrian King List tablets, but is usually placed by archaeologists between Akkiya and Puzur-Ashur I. He is well known from contemporary documents as a career governor who was also appointed over Susa at various times between Shulgi year 40 and Shu-Sin year 4. See Potts, The Archaeology of Elam, p. 132. 
Amar-Sin's reign is notable for his attempt at regenerating the ancient sites of Sumer. He apparently worked on the unfinished ziggurat at Eridu.Mallowan, Max, "The Development of Cities from Al-U'baid to the end of Uruk 5" (Cambridge Ancient History) David Rohl suggested this ziggurat was the origin of the story of the Tower of Babel. 
The Babylonian Weidner Chronicle records the following: "Amar-Sin... changed the offerings of large oxen and sheep of the Akitu festival in Esagila. It was foretold that he would die from goring by an ox, but he died from the scorpion? 'bite' of his shoe."
Eridu was abandoned during his reign[tpl]Fact|date=November 2009[/tpl]. Salinity problems had made agricultural pursuits in this region unprofitable.

[[Walter Wright (boxer)]]

CATEGORIES: 1981 births, Living people, People from Seattle, Washington, Boxers from Washington (state), The_Contender (TV_series) participants

Walter Wright (born February 20, 1981 in Seattle, WA, United States) is an American professional boxer.
As an amateur, Wright amassed a 90-12 record, including 4 straight Tacoma Golden Gloves titles, appearing in the finals of the 2001 u.s. amateur championships,http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2001.pdf and the quarterfinals of the 2002 national Golden Gloveshttp://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USGoldenGloves2002.html and u.s. amateur championships,http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2002.pdf which led to high expectations for him as a professional.  He opened his pro career by losing in his boxing debut to Matt O'Brien by knockout, despite leading on all three cards.  Wright then compiled a string of consecutive victories, becoming a regular fixture at the Emerald Queen Casino in Washington, culminating in his appearance on the ESPN reality show "Contender Season 2", a welterweight tournament.  Wright was chosen to be on the "Gold Team" for the show.  He fought Andre Eason in the first round of the tourney, scoring a knockdown in the 1st round, and winning the fight 50-44 on all three judges' cards. He lost his quarterfinal bout to Cornelius Bundrage by unanimous decision; in a post-fight interview, Wright indicated that he'd decided to try and out-punch Bundrage, rather than out-box him. On September 26, 2006, Wright faced off against fellow Contender teammate Vinroy Barrett, winning by technical knockout in the 4th round of the 6 round bout.
On the January 12, 2007 edition of ESPN's Friday Night Fights at the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Washington, Wright squared off against undefeated but untested Dan Wallace, defeating Wallace by TKO in the eighth and final round.
Wright's next fight came on the Contender's USA vs. UK. challenge at the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Wright faced undefeated Anthony Small at light middleweight. Wright came close knocking out Small in the eighth round, but ran out of gas before he was able to do so. Wright lost by split decision ~ 75-77 | 74-78 | 77-76 ~.
3 years later, on June 19, 2010, Wright returned to the Emerald Queen Casino claiming he had never been away from the sport despite not competing, and won a unanimous decision in a 6 round super middleweight bout over Joshua Snyder.
Wright went on another sabbatical from competition for almost 3 years before filling in as a last minute replacement for Joey Spina on March 15, 2013 against Contender Season 1 finalist and former challenger for WBO super middleweight and WBC middleweight titles, Peter Manfredo Jr at the Twin River Casino Event Center in Rhode Island, and losing an over the limit super middleweight 10 rounder. Before taking the fight on short notice against Manfredo, Wright had served as sparring partner for James Kirkland and had signed to fight Omar Henry just before Henry's diagnosis with cancer, passing only months later.

Jeffrey "Jeff" Atwater (born April 8, 1958) is currently the Republican Chief Financial Officer of Florida.
Atwater moved to Florida at the age of 4 and grew up in North Palm Beach, Florida, where his father, a veteran World War II pilot and FBI agent, served as police chief. He went on to gain substantial experience in banking, and was elected to the North Palm Beach Village Council in 1993. Later, he served as chairman, president, and CEO of the Barnett Bank of Broward County and the Treasure Coast, and later as market president of Riverside National Bank for Palm Beach and Broward counties. 
In 2000, Atwater ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 83rd District, defeating Democratic nominee Pam Dunston and independent Michael I. Danchuk. After just two years in the House, he ran for the Florida Senate from the 25th District, which included Palm Beach and Broward counties. Unopposed in the primary election, Atwater faced off against long-serving Democratic Attorney General of Florida Bob Butterworth in the general election, and, aided by then-Governor Jeb Bush's strong performance that year, defeated Butterworth by a solid margin. He was re-elected in 2004 with no opposition, and again in 2008, when he defeated Democrat Linda Bird, a realtor. From 2008 to 2010, he was the president of the Florida Senate.
Following the decision by then-Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink to run for governor rather than seek re-election, Atwater jumped into the race to succeed Sink. In the general election, Atwater faced off against former State Representative Loranne Ausley, whom he defeated in a landslide.
Although Atwater and his supporters assert that his banking background provides him with a unique insight into legislative issues pertaining to banking, insurance, finance and fiscal responsibility, the bank that he was heavily involved in, Riverside National Bank, was taken over by the FDIC and declared a "failed bank."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/riverside-natl.html |title=FDIC: Failed Bank Information - Bank Closing Information for Riverside National Bank of Florida, Fort Pierce, FL |publisher=Fdic.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Anglo-Scottish border, Mountain passes of England, Mountain passes of Scotland, Cheviot Hills

The Carter Bar is the point at which the A68 crosses the England–Scotland border and forms a pass located at the top of Redesdale in the Cheviot Hills at an elevation of [tpl]convert|418|m|ft[/tpl].   The first sizeable Scottish town is Jedburgh approximately [tpl]convert|12|mi[/tpl] north.   Other nearby Scottish towns include Hawick [tpl]convert|16|mi[/tpl] away and Kelso, [tpl]convert|22|mi[/tpl] away.   On the English side, the first settlement is Byrness, followed by Redesdale, with Otterburn next at the junction of the A68 and A696 then Newcastle upon Tyne [tpl]convert|45|mi[/tpl] away.   The A696 and A68 combine to form one of the main routes (and a popular scenic tourist route) between Newcastle upon Tyne and the Scottish capital, Edinburgh.
In 1575 Carter Bar was the scene of the Raid of the Redeswire, one of the last large-scale battles between the English and the Scots.
Carter Bar was the location of Truce days, that were held between the Lord Wardens of the Marches of both countries to dispense cross border justice in the Late Middle Ages and Early modern period. Truce days were also held at Carlisle and Berwick upon Tweed.
Carter Bar forms a popular point for tourists to stop and take photographs on the Anglo-Scottish border.   There are two marker stones on either side of the A68 for this purpose, the original stone created by local Borders stonemason, Edy Laub.   Upper Redesdale, the Scottish Borders (including Tweeddale) and to the east, the Cheviot hills are all visible from Carter Bar.   However, its altitude means snow is possible even in late spring and early autumn, and the Carter Bar pass can be subject to frequent snow-related closures during the winter.

Moccasin Creek State Park is a [tpl]convert|32|acre|adj=on[/tpl] state park located on the western shore of Lake Burton in Rabun County in the northeast corner of Georgia. The park features campgrounds; a fishing pier for the physically disabled, the elderly, and children; and walking trails.  Even though the surrounding area is mountainous, the camping area is relatively flat.
Moccasin Creek State Park was established in 1963 as a campground, the result of a vision of then-Director of the Georgia Game and Fish Commission, Fulton Lovell.  The [tpl]convert|32|acre|sing=on[/tpl] tract was purchased for $63,415 and the park was originally run by the adjacent Lake Burton Fish Hatchery.  The new camping area immediately became popular with area boaters and fishermen. Just three years after it was established, the campground was turned over to the State Parks Department because it was too busy for Fish Hatchery personnel to manage.  Thus, in 1966, it was renamed Moccasin Creek State Park.  In 1993, a lakeside pavilion at the park was named the Fulton Lovell Assembly Shelter in honor of Fulton Lovell.
The park is located on Georgia State Route 197, [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] north of Clarkesville, Georgia.  The adjacent Lake Burton Fish Hatchery offers an opportunity to learn how trout are raised.  The park offers easy access to the Chattahoochee National Forest and its features, such as the Appalachian Trail.

Saint Alexander Nevsky is a parish of the Diocese of Western Pennsylvania of the Orthodox Church in America.  It was founded in the Woods Run section of Pittsburgh's North Side in 1891. It was the first Russian Orthodox community in the Pittsburgh area.  The first pastor of St Alexander Nevsky parish was Fr. Victor Toth, brother of St. Alexis Toth, who was canonized by the Orthodox Church in America in 1994. 
When the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh took over the Woods Run area in the late 1960s, the parish relocated to Allison Park, in Pittsburgh's North Hills.  The new Church edifice was designed by architect Sergey Padyukov and was consecrated in 1972 by Bishop Theodosius.  The iconostasis, designed by parishioner Vladimir Drobashevsky, and adorned with major icons and feast day icons, was constructed in 1978. The second phase of beautification took place in 1984, and the final phase took place in 1996. Fr. Alexander Jasiukowicz of Chicago and Florida was the icon painter for the church. The St. Alexander Nevsky icon located on the confessional table contains relics of St Alexander inside.
In 1981 Bishop Kyrill designated the Saint Alexander Nevsky parish to become the Archdiocesan Cathedral. The one hundredth anniversary of the community was celebrated in 1991.
At the turn of the millennium, the Cathedral underwent a major expansion to provide greater school facilities, handicapped access, increased kitchen space, offices, and a theological library. A new set of Russian bells was donated in 1999.
[tpl]As of|2013[/tpl] Bishop Melchisedek was in office. The community was led by Archpriest Michael Senyo, who arrived in September 2010 upon the retirement of long-time rector Archpriest Paul Suda. The Cathedral choir was led by Mrs. Larice Nescott. The parish school was supervised by Matushka Susanne Senyo. Adult education was supervised by Father Michael, assisted by Paul Graycar. A large complement of Altar Servers and Readers assisted at divine services. There was a Women's Association.

[[Corey Sanders]]
CATEGORIES: Boxers from Washington, D.C., Heavyweight boxers, 1975 births, Living people

Corey Sanders (March 7, 1975) is a professional boxer.  Originally hailing from Washington, DC, Corey has largely been a fringe contender in the heavyweight division. 
Known as "T-Rex", Sanders' most notable victory came in a shocking KO of respected Oleg Maskaev in 2002, which temporarily derailed Maskaev's plans of fighting for a title. His other notable opponents included Michael Grant, Andrew Golota, DaVarryl Williamson and Timo Hoffmann. 
Sanders gained widespread media attention in late 2006, when he fought a series of four round exhibition bouts against former undisputed heavyweight Mike Tyson during a world tour, which was organized to help pay off Tyson's financial debts. Tyson fought without headgear against the headgeared Sanders, and Tyson appeared to be holding back during the bouts to prevent an early end to the show.
He last fought in December 2007, dropping a six rounds decision to Dennis Bakhtov, which became his seventh loss in a row. His current professional record stands at 23 wins (15 KO), and 13 losses out of 36 fights.

This article described Asa Carter's past involvement with the Ku Klux Klan.Carter, Dan T. "The Transformation of a Klansman". New York Times, October 4, 1991. 
The novel has spawned films, a sequel attempt, and a number of graduate theses and scholarly articles. In 1985, the University of New Mexico Press bought the book's rights. It has since sold millions of copies, a rare level of success for a book distributed by an academic press, and won the 1991 American Booksellers Association Book of the Year (ABBY) award.

[[Bordurian]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional languages, Tintin

Bordurian is a fictional language, the national language of Borduria, a fictional Balkan dictatorship created by Hergé for the The Adventures of Tintin comics series. Little is known about Bordurian, as it is not extensively presented in the Tintin stories. The neighboring language Syldavian, for example, has been proven conclusively to be a Germanic language, and although few words of Bordurian are known, making it impossible to examine its grammar or orthography as can be done with Syldavian, it is almost certainly Germanic as well. Words of obvious Germanic origin include hôitgang, (cf. Dutch uitgang), mänhir (cf. Dutch mijnheer), ointhfan (cf. Dutch ontvangst) sztôpp, tzhôl (cf. German Zoll) and zsnôrr (cf. Dutch snor). As with Syldavian and other fictional languages and some personal and place names in the Tintin universe, Hergé modeled Bordurian on Marols, a dialect of Dutch spoken in and around Brussels, and therefore Bordurian and Syldavian are arguably not only Germanic, but close relatives. Unlike Syldavian, which also uses Cyrillic, it is written only in the Latin alphabet. Orthography is unclear; although it is arguable that ô is /ɔ/ based on the spelling of sztôpp, tzhôl, and zsnôrr, it is impossible to determine exactly how, for example, s, sz, and zs are supposed to be pronounced, whether /s/, /ʃ/, or some other way. The orthography does give the language a feel vaguely similar to Hungarian, which alone among European languages contains the digraphs sz and zs; in addition, the Bordurian capital of Szohôd is reminiscent in spelling of the real Hungarian city of Szeged.
Almost the complete corpus (except for Müsstler, which may simply be a faux-German name and not meant to be native Bordurian at all) is found in The Calculus Affair.

[[Cishan culture]]

CATEGORIES: Neolithic cultures of China, History of Hebei

The Cishan culture ([tpl]zh|c=磁山文化[/tpl]; 8000-5500 BC) was a Neolithic Yellow River culture in northern China, based primarily around southern Hebei, along the north shore of the Luo River. The Cishan culture was based on the farming of foxtail millet, the cultivation of which on one site has been dated back 10,000 years.[tpl]cite PMID|19383791[/tpl]  There is also evidence that the Cishan people cultivated barley and, late in their history, a japonica variety of rice.
Common artifacts from the Cishan culture include stone grinders, stone sickles and tripod pottery.  The sickle blades feature fairly uniform serrations, which made the harvesting of grain easier.  Cord markings, used as decorations on the pottery, was more common compared to neighboring cultures.  Also, the Cishan potters created a broader variety of pottery forms such as basins, pot supports, serving stands, and drinking cups.
Since the culture shared many similarities with its southern neighbor, the Peiligang culture, both cultures are sometimes referred to together as the Cishan-Peiligang culture or Peiligang-Cishan culture, suggesting that they were a single culture.  The Cishan culture also shared several similarities with its eastern neighbor, the Beixin culture. However, the consensus among archaeologists is that the Cishan people were members of a separate culture that shared many characteristics with its neighbors.
The type site at Cishan is located in Wu'an, Hebei, China on a low elevation mesa.  The site covers an area of around 80,000 m².  The houses at Cishan were semi-subterranean and round. The site showed evidence of domesticated pigs, dogs and chickens, with pigs providing the primary source of meat.  The Cishan people hunted deer and wild boar. Nuts, wild apricots and pears, and various roots and tubers were foraged from the surrounding forests. Fish was also an important part of the diet at Cishan, specifically carp and herring from the nearby river; fishing nets made from hemp fibers were used.
Over 500 subterranean storage pits were discovered at Cishan. These pits were used to store millet.  The largest pits were 5 meters deep and capable of storing up to 1000 kg of millet.

[[Booster separation motor]]
CATEGORIES: Space Shuttle program

The booster separation motor on the Space Shuttle is a relatively small rocket motor that separates the reusable solid rocket motors from the shuttle before the shuttle leaves the atmosphere.  This separation occurs after about 2 minutes of burn time of the reusable solid rocket motors, and firing of the booster separation motors takes less than a second. The Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster separation rocket motors must be used in conjunction with the release of the motors from the External Tank (ET). 
The booster separation motors are produced by ATK Launch Systems Group, part of Alliant Techsystems (ATK) Inc., at their facility in Brigham City, Utah.
Booster separation motors weigh 177 pounds when loaded with propellant. Each is approximately 31 inches long and 12.8 inches in diameter. About two minutes into a space shuttle flight, 16 of these small, but powerful, motors are fired simultaneously for 1.2 seconds. This provides the precise thrust required to safely separate the spent boosters from the space shuttle's external tank and orbiter.
Eight booster separation motors are attached to each of the shuttle's two reusable solid rocket boosters, four on the forward skirt and four on the aft skirt. The booster separation motors in each cluster are ignited while traveling through the atmosphere at more than 3,000 mph and an altitude of approximately 24 nautical miles.

The Chambira River is a major tributary river of the Marañón River, and has been the traditional territory of the Urarina peoples for at least the past 350 years, if not much longer.http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 Located in the Amazon jungle of Peru, otherwise known as the Selva, this river is a tropical waterway with many purposes. There is a diversity of plants and animals in this region which creates a unique ecosystem around the Chambira River.  Made up of "palm-swamps," the region takes its name from the Chambira palm. Until relatively recently, the Chambira Basin has not been the focus of mapping by the Spanish empire or the Peruvian nation. No major geographical surveys of the Chambira Basin were mounted during the nineteenth century heyday of exploration. It was not until the 1970s discovery of hydrocarbons in the region and subsequent indigenous peoples' mobilization and government-backed neo-liberal legislation that the Chambira River's lands have been mapped.

CATEGORIES: Psychoanalytic terminology, Freudian psychology

[tpl]Redirect|Expulsive||Expulsion (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Expulsion[/tpl]
Anal expulsiveness describes a person who exhibits cruelty, emotional outbursts, disorganization, self-confidence, (sometimes) artistic ability, generosity, rebelliousness and general carelessness.[tpl]cite book|last=Kosslyn|first=S.|authorlink=Stephen Kosslyn|others=Rosenberg, R.|year=2004|title='Psychology: The brain, the person, the world|edition=2nd|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Pearson Education|ISBN=978-0-205-37609-4[/tpl]   
Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis theory claims the anal stage follows the oral stage of infant/early-childhood development. This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the bowels but occasionally the bladder), usually synchronous with learning to control his or her excretory functions, a time of toilet training.  For a child in this stage of development, control of bowel movements is the stage at which the child can express autonomy by withholding, refusing to comply, or soiling himself or herself.[tpl]cite book|last=Magnavita|first=Jeffrey J.|title=Theories of Personality: Contemporary Approaches to the Science of Personality|page=90|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2002|ISBN=0-471-37890-9|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2E3aXMMHoFQC&pg=PA90&dq=Anal+expulsive&hl=en&ei=Q1XMTOfjDY3rOabm9bAB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Anal%20expulsive&f=false[/tpl] Conflicts with bullying parents regarding toilet training can produce a fixation in this stage, which can manifest itself in adulthood by a continuation of erotic pleasure in defecation.
Anal-expulsive refers to a personality trait present in people fixated in the anal stage of psychosexual development. The anal stage is the second of five stages of psychosexual development.
In modern times psychosexual stages are considered to have limited value in understanding the more severe psychopathology.[tpl]cite book|last=Livesley|first=W.

Frequency domain (FD) sensor is an instrument developed for measuring soil moisture content. The instrument has an oscillating circuit, the sensing part of the sensor is embedded in the soil, and the operating frequency will depend on the value of soil's dielectric constant.
There are two types of sensors:
Compared to time domain reflectometer (TDR), FD sensors are cheaper to build and have a faster response time. However because of the complex electrical field around the probe, the sensor needs to be calibrated for different soil types.  Some commercial sensors have been able to remove the soil type sensitivity by using a high frequency.

Paek Son-haeng (1848–1933) was a Korean businesswoman known for her massive charitable donations.  The name "Son Haeng" means virtuous deeds, and was a nickname bestowed on her due to her contributions.  North Korean sources claim that she was born in modern-day Chung-kuyŏk, Pyongyang, but South Korean sources claim that she was born in Suwon.[ref]North:  [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/KrOne_magj/news/2006/07-01/2-4.htm|title=인덕높은 애국자로 내세워주시여|work=Uriminzokkiri.com|accessdate=2006-08-03[/tpl]

Regardless of her place of birth, she spent most of her life in Pyongyang, where most of her donations were made.
Paek has often been used by the North Korean regime as an example of a good capitalist, and contrasted to the majority of capitalists who were miserly and non-patriotic.  She is mentioned in Kim Il Sung's 1992 memoirs as someone respected by the people as "a great war hero" due to her success in making money under the Japanese regime.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/Newspaper/english/Books/Segi/Segi1/htm/36.htm|title=5.

Paek made her first major donation after turning 61 in 1908 (see East Asian age reckoning), when she supported the construction of the Paeksŏn Bridge across the Taedong River.  In 1922, she built a three-story public assembly hall in Pyongyang.  She donated land to the Kwangson School, a public school in Pyongyang, in 1923, and to the Changdok School in 1924.  Thereafter she also provided land and an endownment to the school run by Samuel Austin Moffet, and also provided large amounts land to the Sunghyon School in Pyongyang.   In 1925, she donated her entire fortune to charity groups.  
The Japanese colonial government offered her an award for her contributions, but she refused.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]

Pajarito Mountain Ski Area (Pajarito) is located on the north face of Pajarito Mountain, one of the Jemez Mountains in north central New Mexico, west of Los Alamos. It is located on [tpl]convert|850|acre|km2[/tpl] of privately owned land. The Los Alamos Ski Club (LASC), a non-profit organization, owns and operates Pajarito. A typical season runs from Christmas to early April, but an outstanding season may run from Thanksgiving to late April. Pajarito currently does not have snowmaking, but a proposal to provide this capability was approved by the LASC membership and a snowmaking system is currently under construction. It is planned to start producing snow in late 2010. Season passes are available with discounts available for early season purchase.
In summer, Pajarito hosts numerous special events, many involving mountain biking. An extensive network of single and double track mountain bike trails criss-cross the mountain, including a new singletrack trail going to the summit. Pajarito hosts lift access downhill and freeride mountain biking off the Spruce chair, and has continued to do so after the Las Conchas Fire in 2011.  There also are hiking trails, and horse riding is permitted everywhere except on the mountain bike trails. Adjacent to Pajarito is a Los Alamos County campground, Camp May; Santa Fe National Forest; and Valles Caldera National Preserve.

[[Apical ectodermal ridge]]

CATEGORIES: Embryology

The apical ectodermal ridge (AER) is a structure that forms from the ectodermal cells at the distal end of each limb bud and acts as a major signaling center to ensure proper development of a limb. After the limb bud induces AER formation, the AER and limb mesenchyme—including the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA)—continue to communicate with each other to direct further limb development.Gilbert, Scott F. "Developmental Biology". 9th ed., 2010
The position of the limb bud, and hence the AER, is specified by the expression boundaries of Hox genes in the embryonic trunk.  At these positions, the induction of cell outgrowth is thought to be mediated by a positive feedback loop of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) between the intermediate  mesoderm, the lateral plate mesoderm and the surface ectoderm.  FGF8 in the intermediate mesoderm signals to the lateral mesoderm, restricting the expression of FGF10 through intermediate Wnt signals. Then, FGF10 in the lateral plate mesoderm signals to the surface ectoderm to create the AER, which expresses FGF8.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ohuchi H, Nakagawa T, Yamamoto A, et al. |title=The mesenchymal factor, FGF10, initiates and maintains the outgrowth of the chick limb bud through interaction with FGF8, an apical ectodermal factor |journal=Development |volume=124 |issue=11 |pages=2235–44 |date=June 1997 |pmid=9187149[/tpl]
The AER is known to express FGF2, FGF4, FGF8, and FGF9, while the limb bud mesenchyme expresses FGF2 and FGF10. Embryo manipulation experiments have shown that some of these FGFs alone are sufficient for mimicking the AER.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martin GR |title=The roles of FGFs in the early development of vertebrate limbs |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=1571–86 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9620845 |doi=10.1101/gad.12.11.1571[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Latin quotations, Latin words and phrases, Faust

Vi veri universum vivus vici (also written as "'Vi veri veniversum vivus vici'") is a Latin phrase meaning: "By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe".
The English occultist Aleister Crowley took this phrase as his magickal motto as a "Magister Templi," (or so much He disclosed to the Exempt Adepts.)"The Vision and the Voice", Aleister Crowley
The phrase has been made popular as a result of the movie version of the graphic novel V for Vendetta. In the graphic novel, the initials "V.V.V.V.V." appear embossed in an arch of V's hideout the "Shadow Gallery" — the character of "V" explains that these stand for the phrase Vi veri veniversum vivus vici."V for Vendetta", Alan Moore and David Lloyd, page 43 In the film, this phrase appears instead on a mirror, also inside V's Shadow Gallery. (In addition to prominently featuring the letter 'V', the phrase contains five words, which in Roman numerals is represented as 'V'). While the film attributes the quotation to the work Faust (without stating more specifically which version of Faust),Clip from the film version of "V for Vendetta" the graphic novel attributes the phrase to "a German gentleman named Dr. John Faust"."V for Vendetta", Alan Moore and David Lloyd, vol. 2 of 10, page 11
As a result of the claim in the film, this quote is often incorrectly attributed to Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, or to Goethe's Faust. However, no use of the phrase appears in either work, as the true origin of the term is from the privately published German work, Das Erotische in Goethes Faust und die Tantriks.

The axe murder incident ([tpl]lang-ko|판문점 도끼살인사건[/tpl]; Hanja: 板門店도끼殺人事件,도끼蠻行事件; literally, Panmunjom ax murder) was the killing of two United States Army officers by North Korean soldiers on August 18, 1976, in the Joint Security Area (JSA) located in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The U.S. Army officers had been part of a work party cutting down a tree in the JSA. 
Three days later, the U.S. and South Korea launched Operation Paul Bunyan, an operation that combined a return to cut down the tree with a show of force to intimidate North Korea into backing down. North Korea then accepted responsibility for the earlier killings.
The incident is also known as the hatchet incident and the poplar tree incident and "The Tree Trimming Incident" because the object of the conflict was a poplar tree standing in the JSA.

[[Barn spider]]

CATEGORIES: Araneidae, Spiders of North America, Animals described in 1882

[tpl]For|the spider species also known as "barn spiders"|Neoscona crucifera[/tpl]

The barn spider (Araneus cavaticus) is a nocturnal, yellow and brown spider with striped legs and a marking on its underside that is typically a black background with two white marks inside the black, although color ranges can be quite magnificent. It is about three quarters of an inch long with a large round abdomen.http://www.spiderroom.info/va_barnspider.html, SpiderRoom.info VA Barn Spider. Like many other species of orb weavers, it takes down its web and rebuilds another web every evening, consuming the silk from the remaining web to conserve its resources. Its "orb" web is the archetypical web that contains symmetrical spokes connected by a spiral inside. They hide during the day and at night will sit in the middle of the web and wait for an insect to land on the web when hunting.
These spiders are aggressive toward each other.  They will attack each other if in close quarters, though many may inhabit the same structure or area at any given time.   They are most commonly found in rafters and wooden structures in suburban and rural structures or areas, and on boats near lakes, thus getting their name, "barn spider".
They are mostly found in North America in late summer and through autumn.  Barn spiders are most common in the Northeast US and Canada.
When agitated (by a puff of air, for instance) these spiders sometimes bounce up and down in the center of their webs, possibly in an attempt to look larger and more threatening.
This reaction could be due to its response to vibrations in the web when prey is trapped. The barn spider will shake or sway the web to instigate further reaction from the prey caught within the web or to confirm that it was debris or other environmental disturbances (fallen leaves, sticks, etc.). They are also able to glean information about the object/insect, through the feel of the web as it shakes. If the spider senses a likely meal has been caught they will move to it and immediately begin wrapping it with silk.

"Sounds of Then (This is Australia)" is a 1985 song by Australian band Gang Gajang from their self-titled debut album, Gang Gajang.  "Sounds of Then" was written by frontman Mark "Cal" Callaghan.[tpl]cite web |title=Australasian Performing Right Association |url=http://www.apra.com.au/site/public/searchworksresult.stm?worktitle=SOUNDS%20OF%20THEN&switchdet=Y |publisher=APRA |accessdate=2007-10-09 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Whilst the 1985 release of "Sounds of Then" was not an initial commercial success, it has become the band's most popular and recognisable song and reached its peak when it was used as Nine Network's station ID promotion in 1996. The B-Side, "House of Cards", was recorded live for 2JJJ.
In an interview for APRA Mark Callaghan states that the song started as a poem in his notebook, reflecting on the time that his family moved from England to Bundaberg in Queensland, a major culture shock for him.  “We lived half way between Bundaberg and the ocean, all around was bush scrub and cane fields. And walking up to the top of the street to catch the school bus, one morning you turn around and there’s fire. It’s one of those songs where if your goal was only to sell records, whatever it took to do it, then the song would have been called ‘This is Australia’. But it’s not about that. It’s a brick veneer drama. My parents got divorced when they came to Australia, it was a horrible period of my life. And the song is actually about how smells and sounds and sensations can rekindle a memory – which is what music does so successfully for people: I think I hear the sounds of then and people talking / Scenes recalled by minute movement / And songs they fall from the backing tape…Mark Calaghan interview with Debbie Kruger 
The song has also been used in a commercial by Coca Cola and featured in the 1987 film North Shore.North Shore - film creditsInternet Movie database - North Shore soundtrack
An instrumental version called variously: "Sounds of Then" (Instrumental) or (Surf mix) or (Mad Wax mix) was released as the B-side of 1986 single "Initiation". It was also added to the 1996 release (listed below) with an additional B-Side "Giver of Life".

[[Mismatch negativity]]
CATEGORIES: Cognitive neuroscience, Electroencephalography, Evoked potentials, Hearing, Neurolinguistics, Neuropsychology, Audiology, Dyslexia research

The mismatch negativity (MMN) or mismatch field (MMF) is a component of the event-related potential (ERP) to an odd stimulus in a sequence of stimuli. It arises from electrical activity in the brain and is studied within the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychology. It can occur in any sensory system, but has most frequently been studied for hearing and for vision. In the case of auditory stimuli, the MMN occurs after an infrequent change in a repetitive sequence of sounds (sometimes the entire sequence is called an oddball sequence.) For example, a rare deviant (d) sound can be interspersed among a series of frequent standard (s) sounds (e.g., s s s s s s s s s d s s s s s s d s s s d s s s s...). The deviant sound can differ from the standards in one or more perceptual features such as pitch, duration, or loudness. The MMN is usually evoked by either a change in frequency, intensity, duration and real or apparent spatial locus of origin. R.Naatanen, P.Paavilainen, H.Titinen, D.Jiang, K.Alho, (1993) Attention and Mismatch Negativity. Psychophysiology 30:5, pages 436-450 The MMN can be elicited regardless of whether the subject is paying attention to the sequence. During auditory sequences, a person can be reading or watching a silent subtitled movie, yet still show a clear MMN. In the case of visual stimuli, the MMN occurs after an infrequent change in a repetitive sequence of images.
MMN refers to the mismatch response in electroencephalography (EEG); MMF or MMNM refer to the mismatch response in magnetoencephalography (MEG).

Del Rosario University ([tpl]lang-es|Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Señora del Rosario - Universidad del Rosario [/tpl]) is a prestigious Colombian university originally founded on Roman Catholic principles, in 1653 by Fray Cristobal de Torres.  Located in Bogotá, due to its important place in Colombian history, it is known as "The Cradle of the Republic". Most faculties reside at the Cloister, the main campus located in the historic-geographical centre of Bogotá. Nowadays the institution is based on secular ideas and remains very influential in Colombian culture and public life. At least 28 of Colombia's presidents have been students of this university. It has influenced and participated in very important transitional processes like the revolution for the independence from Spain and the drafting of the Political National Constitution of 1991.

Nivea is the debut album by American R&B singer Nivea. The album was plagued by a low-charting first single and major delays. The first single, "Don't Mess with the Radio" was only a minor hit in the US and performed under expectations, which prompted Jive to order the singer to record new songs and axe old ones. This was when her Grammy-Nominated single "Don't Mess With My Man" was revamped and turned into a smash hit. It was quickly followed with a third single, the hit "Laundromat", featuring R. Kelly.  Despite the many alterations made to the track listing, the album was not very successful, barely debuting in the top 100 of the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. The last single, "25 Reasons" was only released to radio and received minimial airplay. To date the album has been certified GOLD by the RIAA with sales of 523,001 copies in the U.S.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] The lead single was a huge hit in Australia, certifiying Gold and peaking at #14.

In its final years the railway was used by occasional freight trains only, usually carrying empty containers to and from storage at Sandown; but, when electrified, it carried an infrequent electric suburban service to serve the surrounding industrial area, operated by single-deck 3-car trains (marshalled as Y-sets). The line had 3 simple stations: Sandown, Hardies and Goodyear (a platform called Cream of Tartar Works closed prior to electrification). The closure of Goodyear station preceded the closure of the remaining two. All stations were unattended by staff members.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

Tightsqueeze is an unincorporated community in the center of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, United States. It is included in the Danville, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The community of Tightsqueeze got its name due to the construction of two buildings close to a road that connected Chatham and Danville during the 19th century. In 1870, W. H. Colbert built his general store close enough to the road that women could go straight from their carriages to the store without getting muddy or dusty.(http://www.victorianvilla.com/sims-mitchell/local/tightsq/name/index.htm)Preston B. Moses, from The Pittsylvania Packet, Pittsylvania Historical Society, Chatham, Virginia, Spring 1995, pp. 14-15.
Soon, another merchant, Isaiah Giles, built a blacksmith-wheelwright shop directly across the road from the general store. It, too, was on the road's edge. Due to the closeness of the two buildings, buggies and wagons had to slow down as they passed between the two buildings. Thus, individuals were told to slow down for the "tight squeeze" where the two stores were located.
As related by Virginia journalist Guy Friddell in his book What Is It About Virginia?, at one point, the Pittsylania County Board of Supervisors changed the name of Tightsqueeze to "Fairview." However, after public protest, the name of Tightsqueeze was restored.  Time magazine ran a feature story about Tightsqueeze and the name controversy.Historic Tightsqueeze, Pittsylvania County, VA Virginia Next American City magazine named it to a List of U.S. Cities with names that make 13-year-olds laugh.Next American City » Buzz » Tidbits: What’s in a name?

Jolan Chang (9 December 1917 - 25 April 2002) was a Chinese-Canadian sexologist and Taoist philosopher who wrote the luminary classics on Eastern Sexuality The Tao of Love and Sex and The Tao of the Loving Couple. He was born in Hangzhou as the son of an army general. After the revolution he lived for a number of years in Canada, but later he moved to Sweden. He died in Stockholm. 
British author Lawrence Durrell wrote about Chang in his 1980 book A smile in the Mind's Eye.
The Tao of Love and Sex (with foreword and postscript by Joseph Needham) interprets ancient Taoist sexual teachings into a modern model of sexuality. Beginning with a background of Tao and yin/yang, the book then goes into the following subjects: the role of women in sex, the importance of sexuality to health, ejaculation control, thrusting methods, descriptions of various sex positions, advantages of female superior positions, erotic kissing and the Tao, overcoming impotence, the importance of female satisfaction, longevity in relation to sexual health, benefits of age differences between sexual partners and breathing exercises. The book demonstrated that the principles of ancient Taoist texts are applicable to stimulating and improving sexual health today.

[[Democratic and Popular Union]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties established in 1977, Political parties in Bolivia

The Democratic and Popular Union (Spanish: Unidad Democrática y Popular) (1977–84) was a Bolivian umbrella political party uniting various smaller left-wing parties. It was formed in 1977 by former president Hernán Siles Zuazo and consisted chiefly of Siles' Movimiento Nationalista Revolutionario de Izquierda (Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement), a spin-off of the Moviminento Nacionalista Revolucionario (Revolutionary Nationalist Movement), and Jaime Paz Zamora's Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (Revolutionary Left Movement). The coalition became extremely popular with Bolivian voters in the late 1970s, due to fatigue with the military dictatorships that for the most controlled the country since 1964.
The UDP presented itself for elections in 1978, with Siles Zuazo at the head of the ticket. By all accounts, it won a plurality. The vote was annulled, however, due to the discovery of massive fraud on behalf of the officialist candidate, General Juan Pereda. New elections were conducted in 1979. They, too, proved inconclusive, as the UDP's Hernán Siles Zuazo, with Paz Zamora as his vice-presidential running mate, finished first at the ballot box, but without attaining the 50% majority necessary for direct election. Thus, it was left to Congress to determine the next Chief Executive, as stipulated in the Bolivian Constitution. Congress could not agree on any candidate, no matter how many votes were taken. Eventually, Congress proclaimed as temporary President the head of the Senate, Dr. Wálter Guevara, pending the calling of yet a new round of elections in 1980.
During the 1980 elections, the ultra-right wing of the Bolivian military began to intimate that it would never stand for the installation in the Palacio Quemado of the "extremist" Siles and Paz Zamora. In April, the small rented plane in which Paz Zamora and a delegation of UDP politicians were traveling crashed in the Altiplano near La Paz, with the resulting death of all on board except the Vice-Presidential candidate. No one doubts that it was an assassination attempt. In any case, Paz recovered from his wounds and resumed campaigning, buoyed by the increasing support received by the UDP in the aftermath of the "accident." The winner of this third vote in three years was, yet again, the Siles Zuazo-Paz Zamora formula. The two would have been sworn in, weren't for the July 17, 1980, coup of General Luis García Meza, which brutally interrupted the democratic process.
Siles Zuazo and Paz Zamora fled to exile, but returned in 1982, when the military's experiment had run its course and the Bolivian economy was on the verge of collapse. In October 1982 the results of the 1980 elections were upheld and Siles Zuazo was sworn in, with Paz Zamora as his Vice-President. The economic situation was dire indeed, and soon a galloping hyper-inflationary process developed. Siles, and the UDP government in general, had great difficulty in controlling the situation. In all fairness, the ruling coalition received scant support from the other political parties or members of congress, most of whom were eager to flex their newly acquired political muscles after so many years of authoritarianism. The unions, led by the old firebrand Juan Lechín paralyzed the government with constant strikes. At this point, the MIR (led by Paz Zamora) disassociated itself from the regime (1984), deserting the UDP's sinking ship when Siles' popularity sank to an all-time low. For all purposes, the UDP ceased to exist at that point.
By 1985, the government's impotence prompted Congress to call early elections, citing the fact that Siles had been originally elected five long before. With the UDP having splintered completely, Siles retired but his MNR-I party ran in the 1985 elections under the leadership of Roberto Jordán Pando. It did very poorly at the polls. As for the MIR (the UDP's other main component group), it ran in the 1985 elections under its own name and finished third. Its leader, Paz Zamora, went on to be elected President in 1989. The UDP was never resuscitated again, but remains a powerful symbol of the early phase of democratic consolidation (1977–84), when it was Bolivia's most popular party.

Salvador "Bubby" Dacer was a publicist in the Philippines. His clients included many of the top figures in Philippine politics, notably Presidents Fidel Ramos and Joseph Estrada.  
Bubby Dacer and his driver, Emmanuel Corbito, were abducted in Makati, the business district of Manila. They were later killed, and their vehicle dumped. In 2001, a number of arrests were made. 
The ultimate reasons for Dacer's murder remain a subject of debate. Fidel Ramos has publicly accused his successor, Joseph Estrada, of giving the original order — Estrada was mired in a corruption scandal at the time, and according to some reports, Estrada believed Dacer was helping Ramos destabilize his rule.

The Atlantic Petrel (Pterodroma incerta) is a gadfly petrel endemic to the South Atlantic Ocean. It breeds in enormous colonies on Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island, and ranges at sea from Brazil to Namibia, with most records at sea being to the west of the breeding islands, and along the subtropical convergence.
The species feeds mostly on squid, which comprises 87% of its diet in some studies; it will also feed on lanternfishes (Myctophidae) as they ascend to the surface at night, as well as on crustaceans.
Although the species exists in large numbers, the world population being estimated at around 5 million birds, the species is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. The species is restricted to just two breeding islands and has declined historically due to exploitation for food, and is currently thought to be threatened by introduced House Mice, which attack chicks leading to low breeding success.
It was formerly classified as a Vulnerable species by the IUCN.BLI (2007) But new research has demonstrated the severe impact of predation by mice. Consequently, it is uplisted to Endangered status in 2008.BLI (2008a,b)

Waynefest was a small, three-day, outdoor music festival held annually between 2002 and 2007 in the southern Alberta ghost town of Wayne. Wayne is located in the Alberta badlands. The first Waynefest took place in 2002 and was initially intended to be a one-time event. It became an annual event after the first festival was a sold-out success. The festival showcases local, Canadian and even some international musicians.
Festival goers camped out in tents, trailers or motorhomes for the three days of the festival. In addition to the music, attendees were provided with several prepared meals by festival organizers, including the famous "Pitch-fork bar-b-que" (steak and/or chicken) speared onto pitch-forks and deep-fried in a vat of boiling oil.
A meagre 500 tickets were sold for Waynefest, which kept it an intimate event where the line between performer and audience is blurred. The relaxed atmosphere was a key feature - you couldwatch a performer on Saturday night and then sit with him/her at breakfast Sunday morning.
Past performers include Ann Vriend, NQ Arbuckle, Wendy McNeill, Melissa McClelland, Danny Michel, Kris Demeanor, Nathan, Elliott Brood, Painting Daisies, Melissa Majeau, Brock Skywalker, The James Murdoch Band, The Wailin' Jennys, Carolyn Mark, Luke Doucet, The Cash Brothers, Plaid Tongued Devils, Captain Tractor and Corb Lund.

Morris Communications started the newspaper in 2005 after the company folded the Carolina Morning News, a wraparound of the Savannah Morning News.
Bluffton Today originally was a free daily newspaper, but on Dec. 1, 2008, it began charging 25 cents per copy (75 cents on Sundays).

The Global Address List (GAL) is a term used in groupware software and means the shared address book which contains usually all people of given organization (company, school etc.). This address book is accessed over the computer network using LDAP protocol, CardDAV or other electronic way (it is not a printed book).
The GAL is usually read-only for users – only administrators add or update the items. Users can search it, lookup other people (employees, students, members etc.) and obtain information about them like e-mail address, phone number, work position, office location and others.
The common usage of GAL is if the user is writing an e-mail, knows recipient's name, but don't know his e-mail address – the groupware or e-mail client (e.g. SOGo, Zimbra or Thunderbird) can lookup the e-mail address in the GAL while user is writing only a part of the recipient's name.

It is the fourth and southernmost space vehicle launch facility (spaceport) of the People's Republic of China. It has been specially selected for its low latitude, which is only 19 degrees north of the equator, which will allow for a substantial increase in payload, necessary for the future manned program, space station and deep space exploration program. Furthermore, it will be capable of launching the new heavy lift Long March 5 booster currently under development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnsphoto.com/trssearch/ShowLibDetailTrs.asp?RecID=11795527|title=Hainan showcases model of Wenchang Space Center (海南首次展出文昌航天发射场设计模型图)|language=Chinese|publisher=China Picture Network (中国新闻图片网)|date=April 29, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2011[/tpl]

[[Stock option expensing]]
CATEGORIES: United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Expense

Stock option expensing is a method of accounting for the value of share options, distributed as incentives to employees, within the profit and loss reporting of a listed business. 
On the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement say that the loss from the exercise is accounted for by noting the difference between the market price (if one exists) of the shares and the cash received, the exercise price, for issuing those shares through the option.
Opponents of considering options an expense say that the real loss- due to the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the shares- is already stated on the cash flow statement. 
They would also point out that a separate loss in earnings per share (due to the existence of more shares outstanding) is also recorded on the balance sheet by noting the dilution of shares outstanding.  Simply, accounting for this on the income statement is believed to be redundant to them.
Note:  Currently, the future appreciation of all shares issued are not accounted for on the income statement but can be noted upon examination of the balance sheet and cash flow statement.

[[Tasman Motorsport]]
CATEGORIES: V8 Supercar teams, Australian auto racing teams, New Zealand auto racing teams, Sports teams in Victoria (Australia)

Tasman Motorsport was a V8 Supercar racing team.  It was formed in 2004 out of what was Lansvale Racing Team V8 Supercar team and was associated with Greg Murphy Racing as a satellite operation.
Tasman Motorsport entered the series in 2004, with a single Holden VX Commodore which was driven by Jason Richards. At the Queensland Raceway round they introduced a VY Commodore and then entered the VX as car #43 for Fabian Coulthard for the Oran Park Raceway round.
2005 saw the team upgrade to a two car operation and move to a new factory near Melbourne, from their previous site in Sydney. With internet service provider Dodo the naming sponsor of the team, both Jason Richards, and Jamie Whincup, had some very good placings including third at the Sandown 500 and second in the Bathurst 1000 This was all after Richards was still recovering after he had one of V8 Supercar's biggest ever accidents at Queensland Raceway barrel rolling at least 6 times after a tag from Paul Morris.
2006 saw improved pace with drivers Jason Richards and Andrew Jones. Armed with many sponsors for the year, including Firepower, SEW Eurodrive and Sleepyhead Bedding, Tasman Motorsport won their first V8 race, with Jason Richards at Winton Motor Raceway in June. At the same event the team got their best qualifying result of third on the grid. Later on in the season the team announced their plans to recruit Greg Murphy for the following 2007 Season.
2007 saw the début of the VE Commodore in V8 Supercars and the team opening a base in New Zealand. Championship wise the team finished 13th and 14th with Murphy and Richards respectively and both nearly stole a Bathurst 1000 victory but finished as the highest Holden, in 4th place. Later on in the season the team announced that Rockstar Energy Drinks would come on board as a sponsor for the last two rounds of the season. The team were on the way to secure sponsorship (with Rockstar) for the 2008 season but at the last minute pulled out.
2008 saw Sprint Gas become the naming rights sponsor for what was due to be a three year deal. Murphy and Richards started the season promisingly finishing 7th and 9th overall at the Clipsal 500 in Adelaide. More top 10 results at the next round at Eastern Creek means that Murphy comes into the next round at Hamilton in 7th place with 330 points.  Criticism was received around the rushed livery that Tasman were running and the team designed a new livery for the Hamilton 400.
2009 saw Jason Bargwanna come in and replace Jason Richards in the #3 Sprint Gas Racing VE Commodore. Despite a standout performance at the 2009 Bathurst 1000 which saw both cars finish in the top six, the team announced it would not be continuing into 2010 and its V8 Supercar Racing Entitlement Contracts were for sale. The team cited lack of funding for 2010 as the reasons for closure.http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/end-of-v8-road-for-sprint-gas-racing-20091119-iosr.html

[[Floating-gate MOSFET]]
CATEGORIES: Transistor types

The floating-gate MOSFET (FGMOS) is a field-effect transistor, whose structure is similar to a conventional MOSFET. The gate of the FGMOS is electrically isolated, creating a floating node in DC, and a number of secondary gates or inputs are deposited above the floating gate (FG) and are electrically isolated from it. These inputs are only capacitively connected to the FG. Since the FG is completely surrounded by highly resistive material, the charge contained in it remains unchanged for long periods of time. Usually Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and hot-carrier injection mechanisms are used to modify the amount of charge stored in the FG.
Some applications of the FGMOS are digital storage element in EPROM, EEPROM and flash memories, neuronal computational element in neural networks, analog storage element, digital potentiometers and single-transistor DACs.

[[Ein Lied kann eine Brücke sein]]

CATEGORIES: Eurovision songs of Germany, Eurovision songs of 1975, Songs written by Rainer Pietsch

"Ein Lied kann eine Brücke sein" ([tpl]lang-en|"A Song Can Be a Bridge"[/tpl]) was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975, performed primarily in German by Joy Fleming. The song was composed by Rainer Pietsch, who would go on to co-write several of French disco queen Amanda Lear's hits in the late 70s and early 80s, and the lyrics were written by Michael Holm, a successful singer in his own right with a large number of hits on the German Hit Parades all through the 70s.
On stage in Stockholm, Joy Fleming was backed by three British singers, Madeline Bell of Blue Mink and the duo Sue and Sunny. Although not German speakers, the trio nevertheless sang the backing which included the last chorus performed in English. Sue and Sunny had been in the original line up of Brotherhood of Man (although they had left the group long before the band entered and won Eurovision in 1976) and had backed Lulu in Madrid on "Boom Bang-a-Bang" when she won the contest in 1969. They would return to provide backing at the next Swedish based contest, in Gothenburg 1985, backing Vikki Watson's "Love Is" for the UK. Sue Glover also participated in A Song for Europe, the UK selection contest for Eurovision in 1981. She performed as lead singer of the female group Unity who came last with "For Only a Day".
"Ein Lied kann eine Brücke sein" is notable in the history of the Contest for a number of reasons, one of them composer Rainer Pietsch's unconventional and highly energetic count-in as he conducted the orchestra in Stockholm; Pietsch loudly stomped his foot and yelled "One, two! One, two, three, four!" and right before the second verse he suddenly made a leap in the air. Footage of Pietch's fervent footstomping and jumping is frequently featured in German Eurovision documentaries.
The song is a dramatic and soul influenced ballad, with Fleming singing that a song can be the means of changing oneself and reaching goals. Fleming also recorded the song in English, as "Bridge of Love".
The song was performed fourth on the night (following France's Nicole Rieu with "Et bonjour à toi l'artiste" and preceding Luxembourg's Géraldine with "Toi"). At the close of voting, it had received 15 points, placing 17th in a field of 19.
Despite its relatively low placing, the song has become something of a fan favourite, with the commemorative CDs released to coincide with the Congratulations special in late 2005 featuring it. It has also been covered by a wide range of other artists over the past three decades, including fellow German Eurovision participant Guildo Horn, and in 2002 it gave the title to Eurovision historian Jan Feddersen's anthology Ein Lied kann eine Brücke sein : die Deutsche und Internationale Geschichte des Grand Prix Eurovision (translated: A Song Can Be a Bridge - The German and International Entries to the Eurovision Song Contest).
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1976 Contest by the Les Humphries Singers with "Sing Sang Song".

CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic cathedrals in Canada, Roman Catholic churches in New Brunswick, Buildings and structures in Saint John, New Brunswick, Visitor attractions in Saint John, New Brunswick

The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada is located on 91 Waterloo Street.
The building was initiated by the second Bishop of New Brunswick, The Most Rev. Thomas Connolly. Realising that the Catholic population required a larger facility, Bishop Connolly on November 14, 1852 announced to the congregation his intention to proceed immediately with the erection of the Cathedral. Plans were subsequently prepared in New York during the winter of 1852-53, the foundation stone was laid in May 1853 and walls were erected and a roof laid by November 1853. The blessing and first mass in the new cathedral were celebrated on Christmas Day.
The task of completing the cathedral fell to Bishop J. Sweeney, the third Bishop of New Brunswick between 1861 and 1865.  The spire was erected in 1871. It has a height of 230 feet to the top of the cross, equal to some 300 feet above sea level and about the highest point in the city. In the interior of the edifice the extreme length is 200 feet, the width at the transepts 116 feet and in the nave, 80 feet.
The cathedral chimes, installed in 1885, were first rung on that Christmas Day and consist of ten bells, the largest about 3,000 pounds in weight. The bells were cast especially for the New Orleans exposition, where they were awarded a gold medal. The chime is in the scale of D major, and includes a flat seventh bell, which will permit music in two different keys and forms.  The whole chime weighs 12,000 pounds, exclusive of mountings. They were manufactured by the McShane Bell Foundry, Baltimore, Maryland.
The organ, one of the largest in Saint John, was built by Casavant Frères of St. Hyacinthe, Quebec in 1952. It consists of a three manual console, which controls four divisions (Great, Swell, Choir and Pedal). There are some 3,000 pipes, the largest of which is 16 feet, the shortest less than one inch. Over the altar is the life-size image of the crucified Saviour. A statue of exquisite beauty of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception, Patroness of the Cathedral is set up in a Gothic shrine offsetting the pulpit of similar design on the opposite pillar.

CATEGORIES: Wine packaging and storage

Alternative wine closures are substitute closures used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. The emergence of these alternatives has grown in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against "cork taint" caused by the presence of the chemical trichloroanisole (TCA).Shriver, Jerry, USA Today (August 3, 2006). And now for something completely differentBusiness Wire (August 9, 2005). 'Just Say No' — To Cork! Don Sebastiani & Sons Announces Plans to Focus Exclusively on Alternative Wine Closures 
The closures debate, chiefly between supporters of screw caps and natural corks, has increased the awareness of post-bottling wine chemistry, and the concept of winemaking has grown to continue after the bottling process, because closures with different oxygen transmission rates may lead to wines that taste different when they reach consumers.[tpl]cite web|last= Goode |first= Jamie, Ph.D. Wines & Vines  |date= August 2008 |url= http://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?content=57269&section=features |title= Finding Closure[/tpl]

[[José María Achá]]
CATEGORIES: 1810 births, 1868 deaths, People from Cochabamba, Presidents of Bolivia, Bolivian generals

José María de Achá Valiente (8 July 1810, Cochabamba – 29 January 1868) was a military general and president of Bolivia (1861–64). He served in the battles of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and conspired against longtime dictator Manuel Belzu (1848–55). Later, he was appointed Minister of war in the cabinet of another dictator, José María Linares (1857–61). In that capacity, he led the 1861 coup d'état that toppled Linares. Originally he governed as head of Junta, and then as sole leader of the revolutionary government.
At first, Achá was quite popular by virtue of having ended the hated Linares' tyrannical rule. He extended a political amnesty, and legitimized his rule by winning the 1862 elections. Soon, however, he was plagued by rebellions, the bane of any Bolivian president during this chaotic period. At that point, Achá invoked a state of emergency and began to suppress civil liberties. In particular, he become unpopular as  a result of the 1862 "Matanzas de Yáñez" (Yáñez Bloodbath), when the Achá supporter and military governor of La Paz Province, Plácido Yáñez, massacred dozens of opposition figures, many of them from the pro-Belzu camp. Among those murdered was former president Jorge Córdova. Eventually, discontent became widespread, and Achá found it difficult to govern at all. Indeed, parts of the party were controlled by different caudillos and military warlords. The president was finally overthrown in an 1864 coup d'état led by General Mariano Melgarejo, who would go on to become the most ruthless and brutal dictator of 19th century Bolivia.
After a couple of years in exile, the broken and unpopular Achá returned to Bolivia, where his safety was guaranteed by the now consolidated regime of General Melgarejo. Confined to his home city of Cochabamba, the ailing former President died there in 1868, less than 4 years after being overthrown.

[[British Rail Class 123]]

CATEGORIES: British Rail diesel multiple units

The Class 123 was a design of Diesel Multiple Unit built for British Rail in 1963. They were built by British Rail at Swindon Works, and designed like all Swindon units as inter-city sets. Ten of the four-car sets were built and introduced in 1963. The units bear a visible similarity to the British Rail Class 309, however there is no 'relation' here as the two types were built by different manufacturers for different markets.
Swindon-built DMUs, including the Class 123 and 124, had a structure and internal construction with much more in common with BR coaching stock (British Rail Mark 1) than they do with many DMU classes. The carriage underframes were longer (Mk1 standard main-line 63'6" frames, vs the 57' frames common to most 1st generation DMUs) and the units were provided with Mk1-style "Pullman" gangways instead of the "British Standard Gangways" fitted to most contemporary DMUs of the period. It was also unusual for a first-generation DMU to sport a front end gangway. None of these units survive today.

CATEGORIES: Eurovision songs of Germany, Eurovision songs of 1976, German-language songs, Songs written by Ralph Siegel

"Sing Sang Song" was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976, performed in German by the Les Humphries Singers. 
The Les Humphries Singers had had a series of hits Continental Europe and Scandinavia in the early 70s, most notably "Mexico" (1972) and "Mama Loo" (1973). The group's usual line-ups consisted of 20 performers and up from all over the world. For their performance in Eurovision they were however reduced to six singers; two female and four male. 
"Sing Sang Song" was composed by Eurovision veteran Ralph Siegel, who had made his debut in the 1974 Contest when he wrote Ireen Sheer's "Bye Bye I Love You", representing Luxembourg, this was however his first entry for his native Germany. 
The song was performed third on the night, following Switzerland's Peter, Sue and Marc with "Djambo, Djambo" and preceding Israel's Chocolat, Menta, Mastik with "Emor Shalom". At the close of voting, it had received 12 points, placing 15th in a field of 18.
The song consists largely of the title being repeated, however the other lyrics are a plea for global unity - to be provided by singing the song.
"Sing Sang Song" was only a modest commercial success for the Les Humphries Singers, and in late 1976 the group disbanded.
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1977 Contest by Silver Convention with "Telegram".

Langmeier Software is privately held, software developer based in Zürich, Switzerland. The company was founded 2004 by Urs Langmeier and develops applications and software utilities for home and business use. Its main product is Langmeier Backup.
2006 the company released a second product, called Testingpoint, which was usueful for monitoring websites and servers. In the year 2007 the company started to sell a couple of other software products for various topics, Anti-Spam software, a game and a software to help submitting information to web archives. All of the software Urs Langmeier produced personally in Switzerland, except Testingpoint, which was developed mainly in Ukraine by developers of the Guriansoft Ukraine Ltd company. Though the main focus of the company was always on the backup program, for which Langmeier Software used most of its marketing and programming budget. The focussing was also visible on the quality of the products. People said, that other products were looking a bit half-baked.
In consideration of the Pareto principle, which says that a company may have 80% of return for products which need 20% of the effort, and products, where this proportion is vice-versa, the company decided to specialise in backup tools, and sold off at 2 June 2008 his part of the rights from the Testingpoint software, from which the company held before 50% of the rights together with an individual.
In the spring of 2008, the company released a USB stick with data backup functionality, called "the Langmeier Backup USB-Stick". The pressrelease about the release of this USB stick was published in summer 2008, and got a huge amount of attention in public media. Many newspapers mentioned the gadget directly beside the Apple Inc. iPhone. Two radio transmitters spoke about the gadget.

Jenny Lee-Wright (born in London, England) is a British actress and dancer who later became a Foley artist.
At age 16, she left school to train with the Ballet Rambert. Within a year, she became part of a French cabaret group that traveled the world. Upon returning to England, she joined Lionel Blair's dance troupe, and then turned to acting, appearing with such comedians as Morecambe and Wise, Dick Emery, Spike Milligan (in his Q series), Frankie Howerd, Tommy Cooper and, in particular, Benny Hill. Her work with Hill earned her the nickname 'The Sexiest Stooge'. Other television appearances included The Golden Shot, The Protectors and Masterspy (as Miss Moneypacker).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496751/bio |title=Biography |author=Gary P.

She began to work as a Foley artist in the 1970s between acting jobs, and in a 1976 magazine interview attributed her sense of timing in that field to her training as a dancer. By the late 1980s, she had switched completely to Foley work, including such films as My Left Foot (1989), Shakespeare in Love (1998), Muppet Treasure Island (1996), the James Bond movie Die Another Day (2002), and The Phantom of the Opera (2004) based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.

[[Telegram (song)]]

CATEGORIES: Eurovision songs of Germany, Eurovision songs of 1977, Songs with lyrics by Michael Kunze

"Telegram" was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977, performed in English (the first occasion on which the German entry had not featured at least some lyrics in German) by Silver Convention, a trio at the time consisting of Austrian Penny McLean (born Gertrude Wirschinger), German-American Ramona Wulf (born Ramona Kraft) and American Rhonda Heath.
When Silver Convention entered the Contest in 1977 they were arguably that year's most established and well-known act; they had had a series of major disco hits in Continental Europe, Scandinavia, the UK and the US; "Save Me", "Fly, Robin, Fly", "Get Up and Boogie", "No, No, Joe", "Tiger Baby", and "Everybody's Talkin' 'Bout Love" and Penny McLean had also scored several solo hits in her own right in Europe, "Lady Bump", "1, 2, 3, 4, Fire!". "Devil Eyes", "Nobody's Child" and "Dance, Bunny Honey, Dance". All of these were written and produced by the same team as their Eurovision entry; Sylvester Levay and Michael Kunze, both of whom would go on to collaborate with other successful Germany based disco acts like Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Boney M., Eruption and Amanda Lear.
The language rule was brought back in the 1977 Contest, four years after it had been dropped in 1973, meaning that each country again had to sing in one of their official languages, in Silver Convention's case German. However, both Germany and Belgium had already selected their respective entries when the rule was reintroduced by the EBU, thus Silver Convention and Belgium's Dream Express were allowed to sing their songs in English.
"Telegram" was performed sixth on the night (following Norway's Anita Skorgan with "Casanova" and preceding Luxembourg's Anne-Marie B. with "Frère Jacques"). At the close of voting, it had received 55 points, placing 8th in a field of 18.
The song is inspired by the disco music popular at the time, with the group singing about their need to send a telegram to a lover to bring him to them. A carefully choreographed dance was performed with the song, with a uniting theme throughout being "connection," ostensibly with the woman and her lover, in which all three ladies linked themselves to one another by touching each other's shoulders, and then hips, as the connection "came back."
"Telegram" only turned out to be a minor commercial success for Silver Convention (#27 Germany), with one notable exception, in Sweden the song reached #4 and became their best-selling single. The song was also released as an extended 12" remix, the 5.50 version was subsequently included on the band's fifth studio album Summer Nights. After a number of revised line-ups Silver Convention disbanded in 1978.
"Telegram" was succeeded as German representative at the 1978 Contest by Ireen Sheer with "Feuer".
