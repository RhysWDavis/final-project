In structure, the United Church has a "bottom-up" governance, where the congregation selects its clergy, rather than clergy being appointed by a bishop or other body. The policies of the church are inclusive and liberal: there are no restrictions of gender, sexual orientation or marital status for a person considering entering the ministry; interfaith marriages are recognized; communion is offered to all Christian adults and children, regardless of denomination or age.

[[Planetary system]]
CATEGORIES: Planetary systems

A planetary system is a set of gravitationally bound non-stellar objects in orbit around a star or star system. Generally speaking, planetary systems describe systems with one or more planets, although such systems may also consist of bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, natural satellites, meteoroids, comets and planetesimalsp. 394, The Universal Book of Astronomy, from the Andromeda Galaxy to the Zone of Avoidance, David J. Dsrling, Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley, 2004. ISBN 0-471-26569-1.p. 314, Collins Dictionary of Astronomy, Valerie Illingworth, London: Collins, 2000. ISBN 0-00-710297-6. as well as discernable features including circumstellar disks. The Sun together with its planetary system, which includes Earth, is known as the Solar System.p. 382, Collins Dictionary of Astronomy.p. 420, A Dictionary of Astronomy, Ian Ridpath, Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. ISBN 0-19-860513-7. The interchangeable terms extrasolar system and exoplanetary system are sometimes used in reference to other planetary systems. Individually they may be referred to as system prefixed by the name of the star or star system that it orbits or sometimes simply the name of the star system.
For a long time after the 16th century and Copernican heliocentrism, human knowledge of planetary systems was limited to heliocentrism and the Solar System. Despite the discovery and exploration of the Solar System and centuries of conjecture, it remained this way until the groundbreaking discovery of the unusual PSR B1257+12 system and its extrasolar planets, confirmed in 1992, which holds a number of significant records, including the first discovered, as well as the first pulsar, multi-star planetary system.
The 21st century has become a golden era of planetary system discovery, with findings occurring at a rapid rate. A total of [tpl]Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count[/tpl] such planets (in [tpl]Extrasolar planet counts|system_count[/tpl] planetary systems, including [tpl]Extrasolar planet counts|multiplanetsystem_count[/tpl] multiple planetary systems) have been identified as of [tpl]Extrasolar planet counts|asof[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |last1=Schneider |first1=Jean |date=10 September 2011 |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia|accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl] Hundreds more systems are unconfirmed. In terms of total confirmed planets, the Solar System with 8 remains the largest known planetary system. However, HD 10180 may have as many as 9 planets, of which 2 are unconfirmed,[tpl]cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2012/04/hd-10180-record-setting-solar-system-spotted/1#.T4DuANnHGC4 | work=USA Today | date=April 6, 2012[/tpl] and is the largest known exoplanetary system along with Kepler-90, which also has 7 confirmed planets. A wide range of planetary systems have been discovered, with a variety of different orbital arrangements around different types of stars. The closest confirmed system is Gliese 832 at 14.8 light years (ly) with one confirmed planet, whereas the closest unconfirmed system is Alpha Centauri at 4.37 ly with a planet of Earth mass. The closest multi-planet system is Gliese 876 at 15.3 ly with four confirmed planets.
Although knowledge of the nature of planetary systems, including that of the Solar System, has increased considerably, much is unknown about their origin and evolution and current theories of their formation and evolution are relatively new to the field of planetary science.
Of particular interest to astrobiology is the habitable zone of planetary systems, believed to be the region with the most potential to develop and sustain extraterrestrial life.

Count [tpl]nihongo|Nogi Maresuke |乃木 希典|[/tpl], also known as Kiten, Count Nogi, (December 25, 1849 – September 13, 1912) was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army and a governor of Taiwan. He was one of the commanders during the 1894 capture of Port Arthur from China, and the Port Arthur massacre.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] He was a prominent figure in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, as commander of the forces which captured Port Arthur from the Russians.
He was a national hero in Imperial Japan as a model of feudal loyalty and self-sacrifice, ultimately to the point of suicide. In the Satsuma Rebellion, he lost a banner of the emperor in battle, for which he tried to atone with suicidal bravery in order to recapture it, until ordered to stop. In the Russo-Japanese War, he captured Port Arthur but he felt that he had lost too many of his soldiers, so requested permission to commit suicide, which the emperor refused. These two events, as well as his desire not to outlive his master (junshi), motivated his suicide on the day of the funeral of the Emperor Meiji. His example revitalized the Japanese tradition of ritual suicide.

VII, § 4 The governor has a duty to enforce state laws as well as the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Utah Legislature.UT Const. art. VII, § 8 The governor may also convene the legislature on "extraordinary occasions".UT Const. art. VII, § 6
The self-proclaimed State of Deseret, precursor to the organization of the Utah Territory, had only one governor, Brigham Young. Utah Territory had 15 territorial governors from its organization in 1850 until the formation of the state of Utah in 1896, appointed by the President of the United States. John W. Dawson had the shortest term of only three weeks and Brigham Young, the first territorial governor, had the longest term at seven years.
There have been 17 governors of the State of Utah, with the longest serving being Calvin L. Rampton, who served three terms from 1965 to 1977. Olene S. Walker served the shortest term, the remaining 14 months of Mike Leavitt's term upon Leavitt's resignation to become head of the Environmental Protection Agency. At the age of 36, Heber Manning Wells was the youngest person to become governor. At the age of 70, Simon Bamberger became the oldest person to be elected, while Olene Walker, at age 72, was the oldest person to succeed to the office.
The current governor is Gary Herbert, who took office on August 11, 2009, upon the resignation of Jon Huntsman, Jr., to become United States Ambassador to China. Governor Herbert was elected to fill the remainder of Huntsman's term in November 2010, and his current term will expire on January 2, 2017.
There is an official seal of the Governor of Utah. Borrowing most of the same symbolism from the State Seal, the Governor's seal includes Roman numerals at the bottom, which represent the Governor himself, and this changes with every new Governor. Each Governor therefore has a seal unique to themselves and their administration. The Roman numerals are currently "XVII", representing Gary Herbert, who is the 17th governor of Utah since Statehood.

The Governor of West Virginia is the head of the executive branch of West Virginia's governmentWV Constitution article VII, § 5. and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.WV Constitution article VII, § 12. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the West Virginia Legislature,WV Constitution article VII, § 14. to convene the legislature at any time,WV Constitution article VI, § 18–19. and, except when prosecution has been carried out by the House of Delegates, to grant pardons and reprieves.WV Constitution article VII, § 11.
Since West Virginia became a state, it has had 35 governors; 32 different men have held the office (Arch A. Moore, Jr. and Cecil H. Underwood each served two nonconsecutive governorships).  Six governors in the state's history have served multiple terms. The longest-serving governor was Moore, who served for three terms over twelve years. The state's first governor, Arthur I. Boreman, served the most consecutive terms, resigning a week before the end of his third term. Daniel D.T. Farnsworth was Senate President at the time; he filled the last seven days of Boreman's term and remains the shortest-serving governor. Underwood has the unusual distinction of being both the youngest person to be elected as governor (age 34 upon his first term in 1957) and the oldest to both be elected and serve (age 74 upon his second term in 1997; age 78 at the end of his second term in 2001).
The current governor is Earl Ray Tomblin, who assumed office on November 13, 2011 after a special election on October 4, 2011.http://www.wowktv.com/story/16027267/earl-ray-tomblin-to-be-inaugurated-as-west-virginias-governor Tomblin, as President of the West Virginia Senate, acted as governor from November 15, 2010 until November 13, 2011 upon the resignation of Joe Manchin to take a seat in the U.S. Senate.
West Virginia was originally part of the state of Virginia, one of the original Thirteen Colonies. The northwestern counties of Virginia broke away during the American Civil War and formed the state, which was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863. Two more Virginia counties, Berkeley and Jefferson, joined the state on March 10, 1866.
To be elected governor, a person must be at least 30 years old, and must have been a citizen of West Virginia for at least five years at the time of inauguration.WV Constitution article VII, § 1. The Constitution of West Virginia, ratified in 1872, calls for a four-year term for the governor, commencing on the Monday after the second Wednesday in the January following an election. The original constitution of 1863 had only a two-year term for governor.WV 1863 Constitution article V, § 1.
The constitution makes no mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor.

[[Constantine III (Byzantine emperor)]]

CATEGORIES: Heraclian Dynasty, Deaths from tuberculosis, 612 births, 641 deaths, Porphyrogennetoi, 7th-century Byzantine emperors

Constantine III ([tpl]lang-el|Κωνσταντῖνος Γ΄[/tpl]; 3 May 612 – 20 April or 24/26 May 641) was Byzantine Emperor for four months in 641. He was the eldest son of the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius and his first wife Eudokia.
Constantine's birth name was Heraclius Novus Constantinus, ([tpl]lang-el|[tpl]lang|grc|Ἡράκλειος νέος Κωνσταντῖνος[/tpl][/tpl]), which was also the official name under which he reigned. The name Constantine became established in later Byzantine texts as short for the Emperor and has become standard in modern historiography. In terms of official Imperial nomenclature, the style "Constantine III" would be more appropriate for his son Constans II (r. 641–668).
Constantine was crowned co-emperor by his father on 22 January 613 and shortly after was betrothed to his cousin, Gregoria, a daughter of his father's first cousin, Nicetas. As the couple were second cousins, the marriage was technically incestuous, but this consideration must have been outweighed by the advantages of the match to the family as a whole. Furthermore, its illegality paled into insignificance beside Heraclius' marriage to his niece Martina the same year.
Constantine and Gregoria married in 629 or perhaps early 630 and in that year their first child, Constans II was born. Their second child was another son, Theodosius. They also had a daughter named Manyanh who later married the last Sassanid King of Persia, Yazdgerd III and had issue.
Constantine became senior Emperor when his father died in 641. He reigned together with his younger half-brother Heraklonas, the son of Martina. His supporters feared action against him on the part of Martina and Heraklonas, and the treasurer Philagrius advised him to write to the army, informing them that he was dying and asking for their assistance in protecting the rights of his children. He also sent a vast sum of money, more than two million solidi (gold coins), to Valentinus, an adjutant of Philagrius, to distribute to the soldiers to persuade them to secure the succession for his sons after his death. Indeed, he died of tuberculosis after only four months, leaving Heraklonas sole emperor. A rumor that Martina had him poisoned led first to the imposition of Constans II as co-emperor and then to the deposition, mutilation, and banishment of Martina and her sons.

The Kilsby Tunnel is a railway tunnel on the West Coast Main Line railway in England. It was designed and engineered by Robert Stephenson.
The tunnel is located near the village of Kilsby in Northamptonshire roughly 5 miles (8 km) south-east of Rugby and is [tpl]convert|2432|yd|m[/tpl] long.
The tunnel was opened in 1838 as a part of the London and Birmingham Railway. It is today the 18th longest tunnel on the British railway system.
The tunnel took far longer, and cost far more money to build than had been anticipated. This was because the tunnel builders encountered unexpected quicksand which trial borings into the hill had not revealed. The excess water from the quicksand had to be pumped out, a process which took several years. Similar problems were encountered with nearby Blisworth tunnel on the Grand Union Canal a few decades earlier.
The length of time it took to build the tunnel delayed the opening of the London and Birmingham Railway. 
It took three years, and cost £320,000 to build — three times the original estimate (£23,758,000 in 2005 pounds).[ref]According to Table 1 of http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2006/rp06-009.pdf, the RPI index in 1838 was 10.2 and had risen to 757.3 in 2005, giving a conversion factor of 74.245.

Gerty Theresa Cori (née Radnitz; August 15, 1896 – October 26, 1957) was an American biochemist who became the third woman—and first American woman—to win a Nobel Prize in science, and the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
Cori was born in Prague (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now the Czech Republic). Growing up at a time when women were marginalized in science and allowed few educational opportunities, she  gained admittance to medical school, where she met her future husband Carl Ferdinand Cori; upon their graduation in 1920, they married. Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922. Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research, collaborating in the laboratory with Carl. She published research findings coauthored  with her husband, as well as publishing singly. Unlike her husband, she had difficulty securing research positions, and the ones she obtained provided meager pay. Her husband insisted on continuing their collaboration, though he was discouraged from doing so by the institutions that employed him.
With her husband Carl and Argentine physiologist Bernardo Houssay, Gerty Cori received the Nobel Prize  in 1947 for the discovery of the mechanism by which glycogen—a derivative of glucose—is broken down in muscle tissue  into lactic acid and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy (known as the Cori cycle). They also identified the important catalyzing compound, the Cori ester. In 2004, both Gerty and Carl Cori were designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of their work in clarifying carbohydrate metabolism.[tpl]cite web|title=Carl and Gerti Cori and Carbohydrate Metabolism|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/carbohydratemetabolism/index.htm|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=June 6, 2012[/tpl]
In 1957, Gerty Cori died after a ten-year struggle with myelosclerosis. She remained active in the research laboratory until the end. She received recognition for her achievements through multiple awards and honors. The Cori crater on the Moon and the Cori crater on Venus are named after her.

[[American frontier]]

CATEGORIES: American Old West, Historical eras, 19th century in the United States, 20th century in the United States, World Digital Library related

The American frontier comprises the geography, history, folklore, and cultural expression of life in the forward wave of American westward expansion that began with English colonial settlements in the early 17th century and ended with the admission of the last mainland territories as states in the early 20th century. Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the Western United States in the second half of the nineteenth century, a period sometimes called the Old West, or the Wild West, frequently exaggerating the romance and violence of the period.
As defined by Hine and Faragher, "frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states." They explain, "It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America."[tpl]cite book | first=Robert V. | last=Hine |author2=John Mack Faragher | title =The American West: A New Interpretive History | publisher = Yale University Press | year= 2000 | page= 10 | isbn = 978-0300078350[/tpl] Through treaties with foreign nations and native tribes, political compromise, military conquest, establishment of law and order, building farms, ranches and towns, marking trails and digging mines, and pulling in great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast fulfilling the dreams of Manifest Destiny.  Historian Frederick Jackson Turner in his "Frontier thesis" (1893) theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as individualism, self-reliance, and even violence.
As the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the West in fiction and film took firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike. America is exceptional in choosing its iconic self-image. "No other nation," says David Murdoch, "has taken a time and place from its past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America’s creation of the West."[tpl]cite book | first=David | last=Murdoch | title=The American West: The Invention of a Myth | publisher=University of Nevada Press | isbn= 978-0874173697 | year = 2001| page= vii[/tpl]

[[List of Governors of Puerto Rico]]
CATEGORIES: Governors of Puerto Rico, Colonial Puerto Rico, Colonial governors of the West Indies, Lists of governors of insular areas of the United States, Lists of political office-holders in Puerto Rico, History of Puerto Rico

This list of Governors of Puerto Rico ([tpl]lang-es|Gobernador de Puerto Rico[/tpl]) includes all persons who have held that post, either under Spanish or American rule. The Governor of Puerto Rico is the Head of Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The position was first established by the Spanish Empire during the 16th century following the archipelago's colonization.
The first person to officially occupy the position was Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León on 1509. At the time, the Spanish monarchy was responsible for appointing the functionary who would perform this office. The first native Puerto Rican to  perform the function was Juan Ponce de León II, as interim governor in 1579. During this administration, all of those appointed to take the position had served another function within the empire's government or the Roman Catholic Church. In 1898,  the United States invaded Puerto Rico and the Spanish government ceded control of the island to the United States. During the first two years, the entire government in Puerto Rico was appointed by the President of the United States. In 1900, the American government approved the establishment of the Foraker Act as a federal law, this act established a civilian government in the island. In 1947, the federal Elective Governor Act was enacted, which created a new system where, since 1948, the governor is elected through a democratic process every four years. The governor is in charge of Puerto Rico's executive branch and is responsible for appointing executive branch agency heads, including the Secretary of State, who fulfills the role of lieutenant governor, the legislative branch's Ombudsman and Comptroller and all judges in the judicial branch.

is a large palace in Istanbul, Turkey, that was the primary residence of the Ottoman Sultans for approximately 400 years (1465-1856) of their 624-year reign.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/travel/center-of-ottoman-power.html|title=Center of Ottoman Power|work=New York Times|last= Simons|first=Marlise |accessdate=2009-06-04 | date=1993-08-22[/tpl]
As well as a royal residence, the palace was a setting for state occasions and royal entertainments. It is now a major tourist attraction and contains important holy relics of the Muslim world, including Muhammed's cloak and sword. The Topkapı Palace is among the monuments contained within the "Historic Areas of Istanbul", which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, and is described under UNESCO's criterion iv as "the best examples of ensembles of palaces ... of the Ottoman period."[tpl]cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/periodicreporting/EUR/cycle01/section2/356-summary.pdf |format=PDF|title=2006 Periodic Reporting |accessdate=2008-09-17 |author=ICOMOS |year=2006 |work=State of Conservation of World Heritage Properties in Europe SECTION II |publisher=UNESCO[/tpl]
The palace complex consists of four main courtyards and many smaller buildings. At its peak, the palace was home to as many as 4,000 people, and covered a large area with a long shoreline. It contained mosques, a hospital, bakeries, and a mint. Construction began in 1459, ordered by Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Byzantine Constantinople. It was originally called the New Palace (Yeni Sarayı) to distinguish it from the previous residence. It received the name "Topkapı" (Cannon Gate[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8833/ |title = Top Capou (i.e. Top Kapı), Constantinople, Turkey |website = World Digital Library |date = 1890–1900 |accessdate = 2013-10-20 [/tpl]) in the 19th century, after a (now lost) gate and shore pavilion.  The complex was expanded over the centuries, with major renovations after the 1509 earthquake and the 1665 fire.
After the 17th century me and the Topkapı Palace gradually lost its importance as the sultans preferred to spend more time in their new palaces along the Bosphorus. In 1856, Sultan Abdül Mecid I decided to move the court to the newly built Dolmabahçe Palace, the first European-style palace in the city. Some functions, such as the imperial treasury, the library, and the mint, were retained in the Topkapı Palace.
Following the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1923, Topkapı Palace was transformed by a government decree dated April 3, 1924 into a museum of the imperial era. The Topkapı Palace Museum is administered by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The palace complex has hundreds of rooms and chambers, but only the most important are accessible to the public today. The complex is guarded by officials of the ministry as well as armed guards of the Turkish military. The palace includes many fine examples of Ottoman architecture. It contains large collections of porcelain, robes, weapons, shields, armor, Ottoman miniatures, Islamic calligraphic manuscripts and murals, as well as a display of Ottoman treasures and jewelry.

Mission Detroit was a pre-dawn glider-borne combat assault in the American airborne landings in Normandy, made by elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division on the early morning of June 6, 1944. It was part of Operation Neptune, the assault portion of the Allied invasion of France, Operation Overlord. Originally slated to be the main assault for the 82nd Airborne, the glider operation instead became the first reinforcement mission after the main parachute combat assault, Mission Boston. The landing zone for mission Detroit was near Sainte-Mère-Église, to the west of Utah beach.
The objective of the division was to secure the town of Sainte-Mère-Église and to take the bridges along the Merderet River. By doing this, the 4th Infantry Division coming in at Utah Beach would have easy access to making their way northwards towards the ports at Cherbourg.
Casualties for the 82nd on D-Day were about 1,260 of 6,600, or about 20%.
On 6 June 1944 the heavier elements of the division landed by glider in mission Elmira.

Originally slated to be the main assault for the 101st Airborne, the glider operation instead became the first reinforcement mission after the main parachute combat assault, mission Albany.

Kyle Broflovski (sometimes spelled Broslovski, Broslofski, Brovlofski or Broflofski) is a main character in the Comedy Central series South Park. He is voiced by and loosely based on co-creator Matt Stone. Kyle is one of the show's four central characters, along with his friends Stan Marsh, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman. He debuted on television when South Park first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in The Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Stone and long-time collaborator Trey Parker in 1992 (Jesus vs. Frosty) and 1995 (Jesus vs. Santa).
Kyle is a third- then fourth-grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado. Kyle is distinctive as one of the few Jewish children on the show, and because of this, he often feels like an outsider amongst the core group of characters. His portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically, and has elicited both praise and criticism from Jewish viewers.
Kyle is animated by computer in a way to emulate the show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, as well as South Park-related media and merchandise. While Parker and Stone portray Kyle as having common childlike tendencies, his dialogue is often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult-oriented issues, and has been frequently cited in numerous publications by experts in the fields of politics, religion, popular culture, and philosophy.

[[Calcium channel blocker]]
CATEGORIES: Calcium channel blockers

A calcium channel blocker (CCB) is a chemical that disrupts the movement of calcium (Ca2+) through calcium channels.[tpl]DorlandsDict|nine/20112461|calcium channel blocker[/tpl] Calcium channel blockers are used as antihypertensive drugs, i.e. as medications to decrease blood pressure in patients with hypertension. CCBs are particularly effective against large vessel stiffness, one of the common causes of elevated systolic blood pressure in elderly patients.[tpl] cite journal | author = Nelson M | title = Drug treatment of elevated blood pressure | journal = Australian Prescriber | year = 2010 | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 108–112 | url = http://www.australianprescriber.com/upload/pdf/articles/1120.pdf | format = pdf [/tpl] Calcium channel blockers are also frequently used to alter heart rate, to prevent cerebral vasospasm, and to reduce chest pain caused by angina pectoris.

[[Acculturation]]

CATEGORIES: Cultural studies, Social psychology

Acculturation explains the process of cultural change and psychological change that results following meeting between cultures.[ref][tpl]cite journal | last=Sam | first=David L. |author2=Berry, John W. | title=Acculturation When Individuals and Groups of Different Cultural Backgrounds Meet | journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science | date=1 July 2010 | volume=5 | issue=4 | page=472 | doi=10.1177/1745691610373075[/tpl]
[/ref] The effects of acculturation can be seen at multiple levels in both interacting cultures. At the group level, acculturation often results in changes to culture, customs, and social institutions. Noticeable group level effects of acculturation often include changes in food, clothing, and language. At the individual level, differences in the way individuals acculturate have been shown to be associated not just with changes in daily behavior, but with numerous measures of psychological and physical well-being. As enculturation is used to describe the process of first-culture learning, acculturation can be thought of as second-culture learning.
The concept of acculturation has been studied scientifically since 1918.[ref][tpl]cite journal | last=Rudmin | first=Floyd W. | title=Critical history of the acculturation psychology of assimilation, separation, integration, and marginalization. | journal=Review of General Psychology | year=2003 | url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.1.3 | volume=7 | issue=1 | page=3 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.1.3[/tpl]
[/ref] As it has been approached at different times from the fields of psychology, anthropology, and sociology, numerous theories and definitions have emerged to describe elements of the acculturative process. Despite definitions and evidence that acculturation entails a two-way process of change, research and theory have primarily focused on the adjustments and adaptations made by minorities such as immigrants, refugees, and indigenous peoples in response to their contact with the dominant majority. Contemporary research has primarily focused on different strategies of acculturation and how variations in acculturation affect how well individuals adapt to their society.

[[Glory (optical phenomenon)]]
CATEGORIES: Atmospheric optical phenomena

A glory is an optical phenomenon that resembles an iconic saint's halo about the shadow of the observer's head. The effect is believed to happen due to classical wave tunneling, when light nearby the droplet tunnels through air inside the droplet and, in the case of glory, is emitted backwards due to resonance effects.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-27-16-1379 | title=Does the glory have a simple explanation? Opt. Lett. 27, 1379-1381 (2002) | date= January 2012 | accessdate=8 January 2012 [/tpl]
The angular size is much smaller than a rainbow, about 5° to 20°, depending on the size of the droplets. The glory can only be seen when the observer is directly between the sun and cloud of refracting water droplets. Hence, it is commonly observed whilst airborne, with the glory surrounding the airplane's shadow on clouds (this is often called The Glory of the Pilot). Glories can also be seen from mountains and tall buildings, when there are clouds or fog below the level of the observer.  The phenomenon is related to the optical phenomenon anthelion.

Mumbles or The Mumbles ([tpl]lang-cy|Y Mwmbwls[/tpl]) is a headland sited on the western edge of Swansea Bay. The headland is thought by some to have been named by French sailors, after the shape of the two anthropomorphic islands which comprise the headland. Another possible source of the name is from the word Mamucium which is thought to derive from the Celtic language meaning breast-shaped hill.  Its lighthouse was built during the 1790s and was converted to solar powered operation in 1995.http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/mumbles.html The nearby pier was opened in 1898 at the terminus of the Mumbles Railway, which in its time was one of the oldest passenger railways in the world.

Landscape ecology is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.
As a highly interdisciplinary field in systems science, landscape ecology integrates biophysical and analytical approaches with humanistic and holistic perspectives across the natural sciences and social sciences.  Landscapes are spatially heterogeneous geographic areas characterized by diverse interacting patches or ecosystems, ranging from relatively natural terrestrial and aquatic systems such as forests, grasslands, and lakes to human-dominated environments including agricultural and urban settings.Turner, M.G., R. H. Gardner and R. V. O'Neill 2001.  Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.Forman, R.T.T. 1995.  Land Mosaics: The Ecology of Landscapes and Regions.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.  The most salient characteristics of landscape ecology are its emphasis on the relationship among pattern, process and scale, and its focus on broad-scale ecological and environmental issues. These necessitate the coupling between biophysical and socioeconomic sciences.  Key research topics in landscape ecology include ecological flows in landscape mosaics, land use and land cover change, scaling, relating landscape pattern analysis with ecological processes, and landscape conservation and sustainability.Wu & Hobbs 2002

In earlier years, the European Grand Prix was not a race in its own right but just an honorific title; one of the national Grands Prix was also designated as the European Grand Prix. The first race to be so named was the 1923 Italian Grand Prix, held at Monza and won by Carlo Salamano in a Fiat and the last one was the 1977 British Grand Prix.

[[Keratoconus]]

CATEGORIES: Disorders of sclera and cornea, Diseases of the eye and adnexa

Keratoconus (from Greek: kerato- horn, cornea; and konos cone) is a degenerative disorder of the eye in which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a more conical shape than the more normal gradual curve.
Keratoconus can cause substantial distortion of vision, with multiple images, streaking and sensitivity to light all often reported by the patient. It is typically diagnosed in the patient's adolescent years. If afflicting both eyes, the deterioration in vision can affect the patient's ability to drive a car or read normal print.
In most cases, corrective lenses fitted by a specialist are effective enough to allow the patient to continue to drive legally and likewise function normally. Further progression of the disease may require surgery, for which several options are available, including intrastromal corneal ring segments, cross-linking, mini asymmetric radial keratotomy and, in 25% of cases, corneal transplantation.
Estimates of the prevalence for keratoconus range from 1 in 500 to 1 in 2000 people,[tpl]cite web|last=Weissman|first=Barry|title=Keratoconus|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1194693-overview#showall|work=WebMD, LLC|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=24 December 2012[/tpl] but difficulties with differential diagnosis cause uncertainty as to its prevalence.  It seems to occur in populations throughout the world, although it is observed more frequently in certain ethnic groups, such as South Asians. Environmental and genetic factors are considered possible causes, but the exact cause is uncertain. It has been associated with detrimental enzyme activity within the cornea, and is more common in patients with Down syndrome.

A regional variant of the florin was the Rheingulden, minted by several German states encompassing the commercial centers of the Rhein (Rhine) River valley, under a series of monetary conventions starting in 1354, initially at a standard practically identical to the Florentine florin (98% gold, 3.54 grams).  By 1419, the weight had been slightly reduced (to 3.51 grams) and the alloy was substantially reduced (to 79% gold).  By 1626, the alloy had been slightly reduced again (to 77% gold), while the weight was more substantially reduced (to 3.240 grams).  In 1409, the Rheingulden standard (at the time 91.7% gold) was adopted for the Holy Roman Empire's Reichsgulden.[tpl]cite book |title=The History of Currency 1252-1894 |author=W.A.

[[Diabolical signature]]

CATEGORIES: Demons, Personal identification documents

In demonology, a diabolical signature (from diabolus, the Latin for devil which comes from the Greek diabolos for supernatural being) is the signature of a devil, demon or similar spirit, usually in order to sign a soul away. The most famous of these is in the story of Faust.
Demons' signatures are designed to disguise their actual names. They are usually signed in blood. If there is a mass of signatures, they are usually signed in a circle.
Some books on demonology, like Arbatel de Magia Verum and The Lesser Key of Solomon (or Lemegeton), assert that all demons have their own signature, collectively called seal of the demons, and sign the acts of diabolical pacts with them. These 'seals' (not seals in the usual sense, as they are handwritten) are lineal drawings, often complicated.
According to The Lesser Key of Solomon and the acts of some witch trials, there are demons that have more than one seal or signature.
It is notable that many of these signatures seem to include the sign of the cross, which is usually believed to scare demons.
There are many instances of supposed demonic signatures. These signs appeared mostly during the Renaissance, in a time in which demonology was a subject of study for many theologians, priests, alchemists, cabalists and other scientists and pseudo-scientists. One of the accusations by which the Inquisition sentenced Urbain Grandier to death was based on several of these signatures.

[[Environmental scanning]]
CATEGORIES: Problem solving, Research, Research methods

Environmental scanning is one essential component of the global environmental analysis. Environmental monitoring, environmental forecasting and environmental assessment complete the global environmental analysis. The global environment refers to the macro environment which comprises industries, markets, companies, clients and competitors. Consequently, there exist corresponding analyses on the micro-level. Suppliers, customers and competitors representing the micro environment of a company are analyzed within the industry analysis.Dillerup, R., Stoi, R. (2006), "Unternehmensführung",Vahlen, p. 179 et seq.; p. 187 et seq.
Environmental scanning can be defined as ‘the study and interpretation of the political, economic, social and technological events and trends which influence a business, an industry or even a total market’.Kroon, J. (1995), "General Management" (2nd Edition), Pearson South Africa, p. 76 
The factors which need to be considered for environmental scanning are events, trends, issues and expectations of the different interest groups. Issues are often forerunners of trend breaks. A trend break could be a value shift in society, a technological innovation that might be permanent or a paradigm change. Issues are less deep-seated and can be 'a temporary short-lived reaction to a social phenomenon'.Kroon,J. (1995), "General Management" (2nd Edition), Pearson South Africa, p. 76 A trend can be defined as an ‘environmental phenomenon that has adopted a structural character’.Kroon, J.

[[Absolute continuity]]

CATEGORIES: Continuous mappings, Real analysis, Measure theory

In calculus, absolute continuity is a smoothness property of functions that is stronger than continuity and uniform continuity. The notion of absolute continuity allows one to obtain generalisations of the relationship between the two central operations of calculus, differentiation and integration, expressed by the fundamental theorem of calculus in the framework of Riemann integration.  Such generalisations are often formulated in terms of Lebesgue integration. For real-valued functions on the real line two interrelated notions appear, absolute continuity of functions and absolute continuity of measures. These two notions are generalized in different directions. The usual derivative of a function is related to the Radon–Nikodym derivative, or density, of a measure.

Urbain Grandier (1590 in Bouère, Mayenne – 18 August 1634 in Loudun) was a French Catholic priest who was burned at the stake after being convicted of witchcraft, following the events of the so-called "Loudun Possessions". The circumstances of Father Grandier's trial and execution have attracted the attention of writers Alexandre Dumas, père,  Aldous Huxley and the playwright John Whiting, composers like Krzysztof Penderecki and Peter Maxwell Davies, as well as historian Jules Michelet and various scholars of European witchcraft. Most modern commentators have concluded that Grandier was the victim of a politically motivated persecution led by the powerful Cardinal Richelieu.

[[Analogue switch]]

CATEGORIES: Solid state switches, Switches

The analogue (or analog) switch, also called the bilateral switch, is an electronic component that behaves in a similar way to a relay, but has no moving parts.  The switching element is normally a pair MOSFET transistors, one an N-channel device, the other a P-channel device. The device can conduct analog or digital signals in either direction when on and isolates the switched terminals when off. Analogue switches are usually manufactured as integrated circuits in packages containing multiple switches (typically two, four or eight). These include the 4016 and 4066 from the 4000 series.
The control input to the device may be a signal that switches between the positive and negative supply voltages, with
the more positive voltage switching the device on and the more negative switching the device off.  Other circuits
are designed to communicate through a serial port with a host controller in order to set switches on or off.
The signal being switched must remain within the bounds of the positive and negative supply rails which are connected to the P-MOS and N-MOS body terminals. The switch generally provides good isolation between the control signal and the input/output signals. They are not used for high voltage switching.
Important parameters of an analogue switch are:

The Saab 900 is a compact luxury automobile that was produced by Saab Automobile from 1978 until 1998 in two generations. The first generation from 1978 to 1993 is known as the "classic"; the generation from 1994 to 1998 is known as the "new generation" (see below).
The "classic" Saab 900 was based on the Saab 99 chassis, though with a longer front end to meet U.S. frontal crash regulations. The 900 was produced in 2- and 4-door sedan, and 3- and 5-door hatchback configurations; in addition, from 1986, a cabriolet (convertible) model was produced. There were single- and twin-carburetor, fuel-injection, and turbocharged engines, including both Full-Pressure Turbo (FPT), and, in European models during the early 1990s, Low-Pressure Turbos (LPT).

A wheelbarrow is a small hand-propelled vehicle, usually with just one wheel, designed to be pushed and guided by a single person using two handles to the rear, or by a sail to push the ancient wheelbarrow by wind.  The term "wheelbarrow" is made of two words: "wheel" and "barrow."  "Barrow" is a derivation of the Old English "bearwe" which was a device used for carrying loads.
The wheelbarrow is designed to distribute the weight of its load between the wheel and the operator so enabling the convenient carriage of heavier and bulkier loads than would be possible were the weight carried entirely by the operator. As such it is a second-class lever. Traditional Chinese wheelbarrows, however, had a central wheel supporting the whole load. Use of wheelbarrows is common in the construction industry and in gardening. Typical capacity is approximately 170 litres (6 cubic feet) of material.
A two-wheel type is more stable on level ground, while the almost universal one-wheel type has better maneuverability in small spaces, on planks or when tilted ground would throw the load off balance. The use of one wheel also permits greater control of the deposition of the load on emptying.

Street reclaiming is the process of converting, or otherwise returning streets to a stronger focus on non-car use - walking, cycling and active street life. It is advocated by many urban planners and urban economists, of widely varying political points of view.  Its primary benefits are thought to be:
Some consider the best advantages to be gained by redesigning streets, for example as shared space, while others, such as campaigns like "Reclaim the Streets", a widespread "dis-organization", run a variety of events to physically reclaim the streets for political and artistic actions, often called street parties. David Engwicht is also a strong proponent of the concept that street life, rather than physical redesign, is the primary tool of street reclamation.

The Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich ([tpl]lang-de|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München[/tpl]), commonly known as the University of Munich or LMU, is a university in Munich, Germany. It is publicly owned, also covers a research institute and is among Germany's oldest universities.
Originally established in Ingolstadt in 1472 by Duke Ludwig IX of Bavaria-Landshut, the university was moved in 1800 to Landshut by King Maximilian I of Bavaria when Ingolstadt was threatened by the French, before being relocated to its present-day location in Munich in 1826 by King Ludwig I of Bavaria. In 1802, the university was officially named Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität by King Maximilian I of Bavaria in his as well as the university's original founder's honour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni-muenchen.de/ueber_die_lmu/profil/geschichte/landshut/index.html |title=Landshut (1800 - 1826) - LMU München |publisher=Uni-muenchen.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28[/tpl]
The University of Munich has, particularly since the 19th century, been considered as one of Germany's as well as one of Europe's most prestigious universities; with 34 Nobel laureates associated with the university, it ranks 13th worldwide by number of Nobel laureates. Among these were Wilhelm Röntgen, Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, Otto Hahn and Thomas Mann. Pope Benedict XVI was also a student and professor at the university. The LMU has recently been conferred the title of "elite university" under the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
The LMU is currently the second-largest university in Germany in terms of student population; in the winter semester of 2009/2010, the university had a total of 45,539 matriculated students. Of these, 7,801 were freshmen while international students totalled 6,743 or almost 15% of the student population. As for operating budget, the university records in 2008 a total of 458.8 million Euros in funding without the university hospital; with the university hospital, the university has a total funding amounting to approximately 1 billion Euros.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni-muenchen.de/ueber_die_lmu/zahlen_fakten/index.html |title=Zahlen und Fakten - LMU München |publisher=Uni-muenchen.de |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28[/tpl]

Herminie Cadolle (1845–1926) was the inventor of the modern bra and founder of the Cadolle lingerie house.
Cadolle was a close friend of the French insurrectionist Louise Michel, and it was this connection that led her to leave for the safety of Buenos Aires. Here, in 1887, Herminie opened a shop selling made-to-measure underwear.
Returning to Paris in 1889, she opened a similar lingerie workshop on the street Chaussée d'Antin, where she invented a two-piece undergarment called le bien-être (the wellbeing). The lower part was a corset for the waist and the upper supported the breasts by means of shoulder straps. She exhibited at the Great Exposition of 1900 and by 1905 the upper half was being sold separately as a soutien-gorge (literally, "support for the throat", but gorge in old French meant breast), the name by which bras are still known in France.
Herminie became a fitter of bras to queens, princesses, dancers, and actresses. Mata Hari was among her customers. She was also the first to use cloth incorporating rubber (elastic) thread. Cadolle's business is still running today.

[[ISAM]]

CATEGORIES: Computer file systems, Computer file formats

ISAM stands for Indexed Sequential Access Method, a method for indexing data for fast retrieval. ISAM was originally developed by IBM for mainframe computers. Today the term is used for several related concepts:
In an ISAM system, data is organized into records which are composed of fixed length fields. Records are stored sequentially, originally to speed access on a tape system. A secondary set of hash tables known as indexes contain "pointers" into the tables, allowing individual records to be retrieved without having to search the entire data set. This is a departure from the contemporaneous navigational databases, in which the pointers to other data were stored inside the records themselves. The key improvement in ISAM is that the indexes are small and can be searched quickly, thereby allowing the database to access only the records it needs. Additionally modifications to the data do not require changes to other data, only the table and indexes in question.
When an ISAM file is created, index nodes are fixed, and their pointers do not change during inserts and deletes that occur later (only content of leaf nodes change afterwards). As a consequence of this, if inserts to some leaf node exceed the node's capacity, new records are stored in overflow chains. If there are many more inserts than deletions from a table, these overflow chains can gradually become very large, and this affects the time required for retrieval of a record.Ramakrishnan Raghu, Gehrke Johannes - Database Management Systems, McGraw-Hill Higher Education (2000), 2nd edition (en) page 252
Relational databases can easily be built on an ISAM framework with the addition of logic to maintain the validity of the links between the tables. Typically the field being used as the link, the foreign key, will be indexed for quick lookup. While this is slower than simply storing the pointer to the related data directly in the records, it also means that changes to the physical layout of the data do not require any updating of the pointers—the entry will still be valid.
ISAM is very simple to understand and implement, as it primarily consists of direct, sequential access to a database file. It is also very inexpensive. The tradeoff is that each client machine must manage its own connection to each file it accesses. This, in turn, leads to the possibility of conflicting inserts into those files, leading to an inconsistent database state. This is typically solved with the addition of a client-server framework which marshals client requests and maintains ordering. This is the basic concept behind a database management system (DBMS), which is a client layer over the underlying data store.
ISAM was replaced at IBM with a methodology called VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method). Still later, IBM developed DB2 which, as of 2004, IBM promotes as their primary database management system. VSAM is the physical access method used in DB2.
The OpenVMS operating system uses the Files-11 file system in conjunction with RMS (Record Management Services). RMS provides an additional layer between the application and the files on disk that provides a consistent method of data organization and access across multiple 3GL and 4GL languages. RMS provides 4 different methods of accessing data; Sequential, Relative Record Number Access, Record File Address Access, and Indexed Access.
The Indexed Access method of reading or writing data only provides the desired outcome if in fact the file is organized as an ISAM file with the appropriate, previously defined keys. Access to data via the previously defined key(s) is extremely fast. Multiple keys, overlapping keys and key compression within the hash tables are supported. A utility to define/redefine keys in existing files is provided. Records can be deleted, although "garbage collection" is done via a separate utility.

[[Algonquin people]]
CATEGORIES: Algonquin, Algonquian ethnonyms

The Algonquins  are  Native Canadian inhabitants  of North America who speak the Algonquin language, a divergent dialect of the Ojibwe language, which is part of the Algonquian language family.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=59 |title=Assembly of First Nations - The Story |work=The Assembly of First Nations[/tpl] Culturally and linguistically, they are closely related to the Odawa and Ojibwe, with whom they form the larger Anicinàpe (Anishinaabe) grouping. The Algonquin people call themselves Omàmiwinini (plural: Omàmiwininiwak) or the more generalised name of Anicinàpe.
Though known by several names in the past, the most common term "Algonquin" has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word elakómkwik ([tpl]IPA-alg|ɛlæˈɡomoɡwik|IPA[/tpl]):  "they are our relatives/allies".Campbell (1997:401 n. 133, 136)Bright, William (2004). Native American Place Names of the United States. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 32  The much larger heterogeneous group of Algonquian-speaking peoples, who stretch from Virginia to the Rocky Mountains and north to Hudson Bay, was named after the tribe.
Most Algonquins live in Quebec.  The nine Algonquin bands in that province and one in Ontario have a combined population of about 11,000.  (Popular usage reflects some confusion on the point.  The term "Algonquin" is sometimes used, in the Catholic Encyclopedia, to refer to all Algonquian-speaking societies, although this is not correct.)
Many Algonquins still speak the Algonquin language, called generally Anicinàpemowin or specifically Omàmiwininìmowin. The language is considered one of several divergent dialects of the Anishinaabe languages. Among younger speakers, the Algonquin language has experienced strong word borrowings from the Cree language.Artuso, Christian. 1998. noogom gaa-izhi-anishinaabemonaaniwag: Generational Difference in Algonquin. Winnipeg: The University of Manitoba Press.
Traditionally, the Algonquins lived in either a birch bark wìkiwàms or in wooden mìkiwàms.Cuoq, Jean André. 1886. Lexique de la Langue Algonquine, Montréal: J. Chapleau & Fils.  Today Algonquins live in housings like those of the general public.
Traditionally, the Algonquins were practitioners of Midewiwin (the right path). They  believed they were surrounded by many manitòk or spirits in the natural world. French missionaries converted many Algonquins to Catholicism in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, many of the people practice traditional Midewiwin or a syncretic merging of Christianity and Midewiwin.

[[Hiisi]]
CATEGORIES: Finnish mythology, Finnish legendary creatures, Characters in the Kalevala

Hiisi (plural hiidet) is a term in Baltic-Finnic folklore, originally denoting sacred localities and later on various types of mythological entity. In Christian-influenced later folklore, they are depicted as demonic or trickster-like entities, often the autochthonous, pagan inhabitants of the land, similar in this respect to mythological giants. They are found near salient promontories, ominous crevasses, large boulders, potholes, woods, hills, and other outstanding geographical features or rough terrain. In Estonian, hiis still carries the primary meaning of a sacred grove.
The eponymous chief Hiisi is helped by a number of smaller hiidet in the Kalevala. In Poems 13-14, Lemminkäinen pursues the chief Hiisi's elk.
"Hiisi" was also one of the twelve sons of Kaleva, the great king of Kainuu in Kalevala.  Those sons were later transformed into twelve constellations in the sky.
Later the original aspect of nature's awesomeness inherent in the hiidet was diminished, and they passed into folklore as purely evil spirits vaguely analogous to trolls. According to this later view, hiidet were often small in size, on some occasions gigantic. Hiidet could travel in a noisy procession, and attack people who did not give way to them. If somebody left his door open, a hiidet could come inside and steal something. If you were chased by a Hiisi you should seek safety in a cultivated area. In folklore, it was the cultivated areas which were blessed in contrast to the pagan holiness residing in the awesome and forbidding features of raw nature, and evil hiisi could not step inside areas sanctified by human cultivation.
Pre-historic stone structures and large stone boulders were thought to have been erected by hiidet or giants. The Finnish term for a Bronze Age cairn grave (consisting of a pile of rocks) is a hiidenkiuas (hiisi's sauna stove).
A giant's kettle is called a hiidenkirnu (literally, a hiisi's churn).
Often, the English "goblin" is translated as "hiisi" in Finnish, due to the numerous similarities between the typical goblin and hiisi. In the Finnish translations of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, where the word "goblin" is a synonym for "Orc", hiisi is used as the translation for "goblin", whereas "orc" is translated as "örkki".
In modern Finnish, hiisi and its derivatives hitto and hittolainen are mild profanities.

[[Calculus (dental)]]
CATEGORIES: Oral pathology, Periodontology, Fouling

In dentistry, calculus or tartar is a form of hardened dental plaque. It is caused by the continual accumulation of minerals from saliva on plaque on the teeth.  Its rough surface provides an ideal medium for further plaque formation, threatening the health of the gingiva (gums).
Brushing and flossing can remove plaque from which calculus forms; however, once formed, it is too hard and firmly attached to be removed with a toothbrush. Calculus buildup can be removed with ultrasonic tools or unique hand instruments (such as a periodontal scaler).

[[HSL and HSV]]

CATEGORIES: Color space

HSL and HSV are the two most common cylindrical-coordinate representations of points in an RGB color model. Developed in the 1970s for computer graphics applications, HSL and HSV are used today in color pickers, in image editing software, and less commonly in image analysis and computer vision.   
The two representations rearrange the geometry of RGB in an attempt to be more intuitive and perceptually relevant than the cartesian (cube) representation, by mapping the values into a cylinder loosely inspired by a traditional color wheel. The angle around the central vertical axis corresponds to "hue" and the distance from the axis corresponds to "saturation". These first two values give the two schemes the 'H' and 'S' in their names. The height corresponds to a third value, the system's representation of the perceived luminance in relation to the saturation.  
Perceived luminance is a notoriously difficult aspect of color to represent in a digital format (see   disadvantages section), and this has given rise to two systems attempting to solve this issue: HSL (L for lightness) and  HSV  or HSB (V for value or B for brightness). A third model, HSI (I for intensity), common in computer vision applications, attempts to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the other two systems.  While typically consistent, these definitions are not standardized, and the abbreviations are colloquially interchangeable for any of these three or several other related cylindrical models. Note also that while "hue" in HSL and HSV refers to the same attribute, their definitions of "saturation" differ dramatically.  (For technical definitions of these terms, see Color-making attributes.) 
Both of these representations are used widely in computer graphics, but both are also criticized for not adequately separating color-making attributes, and for their lack of perceptual uniformity. This means that the color displayed on one monitor for a given HSV value is unlikely to exactly match the color seen on another monitor unless the two are precisely adjusted to absolute color spaces.
Other, more computationally intensive models, such as CIELAB or CIECAM02 are said to better achieve the goal of accurate and uniform color display, but their adoption has been slow. HSL and HSV were widely adopted as a standard alternative to RGB in the early days of color computers due to their low processing time requirements, and their similarity to  traditional artist's color theory.  Even in the case of digital artists, who generally come to recognize the flaws of  HSL/HSB systems fairly quickly, it is simpler to learn to work around the flaws of a familiar system of color representation than to relearn their entire way of thinking about color by adapting to the less intuitive RGB system of color mixing. Thus, in spite of their flaws, HSL and HSV have proven difficult to replace.

[[Eugeen Van Mieghem]]

Eugeen Van Mieghem (October 1st., 1875– March 24th., 1930) was a Belgian artist born in the port of Antwerp. As a boy Van Mieghem was confronted with the harsh reality of life at the waterfront.
Even at primary school he showed a talent for drawing. He was introduced to the work of Vincent van Gogh, Georges Seurat, Camille Pissarro, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and others at an exhibition organised by Flemish painter and architect Henry van de Velde at the Antwerp Academy around 1892. He attended the Antwerp Academy but was sent from school because his conservative teachers disliked his subject matter and his free, spontaneous way with it. He threw his lot in with progressive political and cultural movements, and joined an anarchist group. By the early 1900s was recognized as one of the most promising young artists of the Antwerp school. He would never renounce his idealism. He became the artist of the typical harbour folk: sack porters, sack makers, emigrants, dockers, bargees, and tramps.
Van Mieghem had his first taste of real success at La Libre Esthétique in Brussels, where his pastels and drawings hung alongside works by French impressionists such as Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Jean Renoir and Édouard Vuillard.
Van Mieghem married Augustine Pautre in 1902. At the end of November 1904 his young wife fell ill. Van Mieghem depicted her in an impressive series of drawings and pastels that rate alongside similar work by such artists as Rembrandt (The Series of Saskia) and Ferdinand Hodler (Valentine Godé). Grief-stricken at the death of his wife, it was 1910 before Van Mieghem showed his work again.
After his first individual exhibition at the Royal Society of Art of Antwerp in 1912 international interest in his work mounted and group exhibitions followed in Cologne and The Hague. In March 1919 he showed his wartime work in Antwerp. This remarkable series of mainly drawings and pastels met with the wide approval of art critics, who compared this work to that of Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen, Jean-Louis Forain, and Käthe Kollwitz. After an article by his friend and Flemish author Willem Elsschot appeared, Van Mieghem was also able to show his wartime work in a gallery in Scheveningen in The Netherlands. In 1929 he became a teacher of life drawing at the Academy in Antwerp and he participated in exhibitions every year until his death in 1930.
In European social art of the turn of the century, international art critics compare his work to that of figures like Käthe Kollwitz, de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Steinlen. Van Mieghem had no equal when it came down to drawing and painting the lives of ordinary people, living and working in an international seaport. When it comes to capturing social reality, his work has much of the power and authenticity of Jean-François Millet's. Like the precursor of social art, Van Mieghem never had to leave his own environment in search of subjects. The world was on his doorstep.
In recent years Van Mieghem's work has been rediscovered internationally. In 2000 a Steinlen retrospective at the Picasso Museum in Barcelona included seven of his works and brought international recognition for his work. In 1993 a Van Mieghem Museum opened its doors in Antwerp with a collection of 150 of his works.

[[RGBA color space]]

CATEGORIES: Color space

RGBA stands for red green blue alpha. While it is sometimes described as a color space, it is actually simply a use of the RGB color model, with extra information. The color is RGB, and may belong to any RGB color space, but an integral alpha value as invented by Catmull and Smith between 1971 and 1972 enables alpha compositing. The inventors named alpha after the Greek letter in the classic linear interpolation formula αA + (1-α)B.
The alpha channel is normally used as an opacity channel. If a pixel has a value of 0% in its alpha channel, it is fully transparent (and, thus, invisible), whereas a value of 100% in the alpha channel gives a fully opaque pixel (traditional digital images). Values between 0% and 100% make it possible for pixels to show through a background like a glass (translucency), an effect not possible with simple binary (transparent or opaque) transparency. It allows easy image compositing.
PNG is an image format that uses RGBA.

Operation Tonga was the codename given to the airborne operation undertaken by the British 6th Airborne Division between 5 June and 7 June 1944 as a part of Operation Overlord and the Normandy landings during the Second World War.
The paratroopers and glider-borne airborne troops of the division landed on the eastern flank of the invasion area, near to the city of Caen, tasked with a number of objectives. The division was to capture two strategically important bridges over the Caen Canal and Orne River which were to be used by Allied ground forces to advance once the seaborne landings had taken place, destroy several other bridges to deny their use to the Germans and secure several important villages. The division was also assigned the task of assaulting and destroying the Merville Gun Battery, an artillery battery that Allied intelligence believed housed a number of heavy artillery pieces, which could bombard Sword Beach and possibly inflict heavy casualties on the Allied troops landing on it. Having achieved these objectives, the division was then to create and secure a bridgehead focused around the captured bridges until they linked up with advancing Allied ground forces.
The division suffered from a combination of bad weather and poor pilot navigation which caused many of the airborne troops to be dropped inaccurately throughout the divisional operational area, causing a number of casualties and making conducting operations much more difficult. In particular, the battalion assigned the task of destroying the Merville artillery battery was only able to gather up a fraction of its strength before it had to attack the battery, with the result that the depleted force suffered a number of casualties. However, the battery was successfully assaulted and the guns inside it disabled, and the division's other objectives were also achieved despite the problems encountered. A small force of glider-borne airborne troops secured the two bridges over the Caen Canal and River Orne, the other bridges were destroyed, and a number of towns were occupied. A bridgehead was formed by the division, and it successfully repulsed a number of German counter-attacks until Allied ground forces from the invasion beaches reached its positions. The actions of the division severely limited the ability of the German defenders to communicate and organise themselves, ensuring that the seaborne troops could not be attacked during the first few hours after landing when they were most vulnerable.

The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the landing operations of the Allied invasion of Normandy, in Operation Overlord, during World War II. The landings commenced on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (D-Day), beginning at 6:30 am British Double Summer Time (GMT+2). In planning, as for most Allied operations, the term D-Day was used for the day of the actual landing, which was dependent on final approval.
The landings were conducted in two phases: an airborne assault landing of 24,000 British, US and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight, and an amphibious landing of Allied infantry and armoured divisions on the coast of France starting at 6:30 am. Surprise was achieved thanks to inclement weather and a comprehensive deception plan implemented in the months before the landings, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to distract German attention from the possibility of landings in Normandy. A key success was to convince Adolf Hitler that the landings would actually occur to the north at the Pas-de-Calais. There were also decoy operations taking place simultaneously with the landings under the codenames Operation Glimmer and Operation Taxable to distract German forces from the real landing areas.[tpl]Cite book| last = Hakim | first = Joy | title = A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1995 | location = New York | pages =157–161 | isbn = 0-19-509514-6 [/tpl]'''
Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces was General Dwight D. Eisenhower while overall command of ground forces (21st Army Group) was given to General Bernard Montgomery. The operation, planned by a team under Lieutenant-General Frederick Morgan, was the largest amphibious invasion in world history and was executed by land, sea and air elements under direct Anglo-American command with over 160,000 soldiers landing on 6 June 1944: 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians.[tpl]cite web|title=D-Day June 6th, 1944| work=army.mil US Army Official website| url=http://www.army.mil/d-day/| accessdate=14 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Numbers of troops on D-day|url=http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/d-day/d-day-and-the-battle-of-normandy-your-questions-answered[/tpl] 195,700 Allied naval and merchant navy personnel in over 5,000 ships were also involved.[tpl]Cite book| last = Ambrose | first = Stephen E. | author-link = Stephen Ambrose | title = D-Day | location = New York | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-684-80137-X[/tpl] The invasion required the transport of soldiers and materiel from England by troop-laden aircraft and ships, the assault landings, air support, naval interdiction of the English Channel and naval gunfire support.

HMS X20 and HMS X23 arrived in position on 4 June and, due to the delay caused by bad weather, remained in position until 4:30am on 6 June (D-Day) when they surfaced, erected the navigational aids, an 18-foot telescopic mast with a light shining to seaward, a radio beacon and echo sounder tapping out a message for the minelayers approaching 'Sword' and 'Juno' beaches.
A similar operation had been offered to the US landing forces to mark their beaches, but this was declined.

[[Classified information]]

CATEGORIES: Classified information, Information sensitivity

Classified information is material that a government body claims is sensitive information that requires protection of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people, and mishandling can incur criminal penalties and loss of respect. A formal security clearance is often required to handle classified documents or access classified data. The clearance process usually requires a satisfactory background investigation. Documents and other information assets are typically marked with one of several (hierarchical) levels of sensitivity - e.g. restricted, confidential, secret and top secret. The choice of level is often based on an impact assessment; governments often have their own set of rules which include the levels, rules on determining the level for an information asset, and rules on how to protect information classified at each level. This often includes security clearances for personnel handling the information. Although "Classified information" refers to the formal categorization and marking of material by level of sensitivity, it has also developed a sense synonymous with "censored" in US English. A distinction is often made between formal security classification and privacy markings such as "commercial in confidence". Classifications can be used with additional keywords that give more detailed instructions on how data should be used or protected.
Some corporations and non-government organizations also assign sensitive information to multiple levels of protection, either from a desire to protect trade secrets, or because of laws and regulations governing various matters such as personal privacy, sealed legal proceedings and the timing of financial information releases.

A security clearance is a status granted to individuals allowing them access to classified information (state or organizational secrets) or to restricted areas, after completion of a thorough background check.  The term "security clearance" is also sometimes used in private organizations that have a formal process to vet employees for access to sensitive information. A clearance by itself is normally not sufficient to gain access; the organization must also determine that the cleared individual needs to know specific information. No one is supposed to be granted automatic access to classified information solely because of rank, position, or a security clearance.

The mines were laid by ships and aircraft, including HMS Apollo, HMS Plover, 10th, 50th, 51st and 52nd M.L. Flotillas, and the 9th, 13th, 14th, 21st, 22nd and 64th M.T.B. Flotillas. In addition, mines were laid from the air by Halifax, Sterling and Lancaster bombers of numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 Groups, Bomber Command, Royal Air Force.
With the exception of the field laid in the Straits of Dover, and an area mined by aircraft to the north of the Frisian Islands, all the minefields were offensive in character. The two semi-defensive minefields, referred to above, were intended primarily to counter any movement of enemy heavier forces from the east. In April and May 1944, some of the mines laid were timed to become effective at various dates so as to escape being swept before the invasion of France.
During the course of Operation MAPLE, a total of 6,850 mines were laid. Of these, 42% were laid by naval forces in 66 operations and 58% were laid by aircraft in 1,800 sorties. These operations made an effective contribution to the general immunity from surface and U-Boat attack enjoyed by the assault forces. A considerable number of casualties were inflicted on the enemy, and their minesweeping organization was stretched to the limit. Minefields in the vicinity of Ushant and off the Brittany coast had the desired effect of driving U-Boats into open water, where they could be dealt with by allied anti-submarine forces. The special operation in the Kiel Canal resulted in a complete dislocation of the enemy organization at an important moment. The entire operation cost the allied cause, in casualties, only one Motor Torpedo Boat 2 and 19 minelaying aircraft.U.S. Navy Operation Neptune

Twice Removed is the second album by Canadian rock band Sloan.  It was released on Geffen Records in 1994, and is considered to be one of their best albums.  It was more melodic and catchy than their previous album, Smeared, and as a result Geffen did not promote it very well because it didn't fit the commercially dominant grunge rock style of the time. The band was dropped from Geffen after Twice Removed was released.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.blogto.com/music/2012/11/sloans_jay_ferguson_talks_re-issue_of_twice_removed/|title=Sloan's Jay Ferguson talks re-issue of Twice Removed|last=Kamin|first=Adam|date=22 November 2012|work=blogTO|publisher=Fresh Daily|accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl]  The band took time off from touring and writing after the troubles with Geffen, and they were rumoured to have broken up.

Operation ''Downfall'' was the codename for the Allied plan for the invasion of Japan near the end of World War II. The planned operation was abandoned when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū, with the recently captured island of Okinawa to be used as a staging area. Later, in spring 1946, Operation Coronet was the planned invasion of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo, on the Japanese island of Honshū. Airbases on Kyūshū captured in Operation Olympic would allow land-based air support for Operation Coronet.
Japan's geography made this invasion plan quite obvious to the Japanese as well; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsugō, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations. Casualty predictions varied widely but were extremely high. Depending on the degree to which Japanese civilians resisted the invasion, estimates ran into the millions for Allied casualties.[tpl]sfn|Frank|p=340[/tpl]
If Downfall had taken place, it would have been the largest amphibious operation in human history.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch13.htm | chapter = 13 | last = Mac Arthur | volume = 1 | title = Reports | publisher = Army | place = US[/tpl].

[[Edwinstowe]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Nottinghamshire

Edwinstowe is a village and civil parish in the heart of Sherwood Forest, north Nottinghamshire, England.
Its name means Edwin's resting place because King (and Saint) Edwin of Northumbria's body was hidden in the church after he was killed in the Battle of Hatfield Chase, near Doncaster, probably in 633. Edwinstowe is referenced twice in the Domesday Book. Legend has it that Robin Hood married his sweetheart Maid Marian in St Mary's Church.
Thoresby Colliery serves as Edwinstowe's main source of employment. However, since the decline of the British coal industry, tourism is now becoming a major influence on the local economy due to the popularity of the Robin Hood legend and the alleged location of his base at the Major Oak.
There was a post windmill south of the Mansfield Road with a small box-style roundhouse. It was driven by 2 common sails and 2 double patent sails.

During its existence, it formed the second tier of soccer in the United States and Canada league pyramid behind Major League Soccer. It was operated by the United Soccer Leagues (USL) and was the successor of the old A-League, which existed from 1997 until 2004.
Several teams left the league in 2009 to form the new North American Soccer League, with the intent of running their own second tier league. Following a brief legal dispute, the two leagues operated in tandem under USSF mediation as the USSF Division 2 Professional League in 2010 before the split became final. The teams that remained in the First Division were merged with the USL Second Division in 2011 to form USL Pro.

[[Classical antiquity]]

CATEGORIES: Classical antiquity, Greco-Roman world, Mediterranean, History of Europe by period, Articles which contain graphical timelines

Classical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is a broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. 
It is conventionally taken to begin with the earliest-recorded Greek poetry of Homer (8th–7th century BC), and continues through the emergence of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire (5th century AD). It ends with the dissolution of classical culture at the close of Late Antiquity (AD 300–600), blending into the Early Middle Ages (AD 600–1000).  Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. "Classical antiquity" may refer also to an idealised vision among later people of what was, in Edgar Allan Poe's words, "the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome!"Poe EA (1831). "To Helen".
The culture of the ancient Greeks, together with some influences from the ancient Orient, prevailed throughout classical antiquity as the basis of art,

("Determinant remained the Italic-Roman spirit, that just availed itself of the borrowed forms. (...)

"Ihre dankbarsten und verständnisvollsten Schüler aber fand die hellenistische Kultur in den Römern; sie wurden Mäzene, Nachahmer und schließlich Konkurrenten, indem sie die eigene Sprache wetteifernd neben die griechische setzten: so wurde die antike Kultur zweisprachig, griechisch und lateinisch. Das System dieser griechisch-hellenistisch-römischen Kultur, das sich in der römischen Kaiserzeit abschließend gestaltete, enthielt, neben Elementen des Orients, die griechische Wissenschaft und Philosophie, Dichtung, Geschichtsschreibung, Rhetorik und bildende Kunst." ("The Hellenistic culture but found its most thankful and its most understanding disciples in the Romans; they became patrons, imitators, and finally rivals, when they competitively set the own language beside the Greek: thus, the antique culture became bilingual, Greek and Latin. The system of this Greco-Latin culture, that assumed its definitive shape in the Roman imperial period, contained, amongst elements of the Orient, the Greek science and philosophy, poetry, historiography, rhetoric and visual arts.")
These ideals were preserved and imitated by the Romans.

[tpl]Link-interwiki|en=Allert de Lange|lang=de|lang_title=Allert de Lange Verlag[/tpl], Amsterdam 1939, p. 113. "Es ist ein merkwürdiges Schauspiel — dieser Kampf eines bewussten Römertums gegen die geriebene Gewandtheit des Hellenismus: der römische Geschmack wehrt sich und verbohrt sich trotzig in sich selbst, aber es fällt ihm nicht genug ein, er kann nicht über seine Grenzen weg; was die Griechen bieten, hat soviel Reiz und Bequemlichkeit. In der bildenden Kunst und in der Philosophie gab das Römertum zuerst den Kampf um seine Selbständigkeit auf — Bilden um des Bildes willen, Forschen und Grübeln, theoretische Wahrheitssuche und Spekulation lagen ihm durchaus nicht." ("It is a strange spectacle: this fight of a conscious Roman striving against the wily ingenuity of Hellenism. The Roman taste offers resistance, defiantly goes mad about itself, but there does not come enough into its mind, it is not able to overcome its limits; there is so much charm and so much comfort in what the Greeks afford. In visual arts and philosophy, Romanism first abandoned the struggle for its independence — forming for the sake of the form, poring and investigation, theoretical speculation and hunt for truth were by no means in its line.")
This Greco-Roman cultural foundation has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, philosophy, science, art, and architecture of the modern world: From the surviving fragments of classical antiquity, a revival movement was gradually formed from the 14th century onwards which came to be known later in Europe as the Renaissance, and again resurgent during various neo-classical revivals in the 18th and 19th centuries.

It began in 2003 with the sending of the two rovers—MER-A Spirit and  MER-B Opportunity—to explore the Martian surface and geology.
The mission's scientific objective was to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. The mission  is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, which includes three previous successful landers: the two Viking program landers in 1976 and Mars Pathfinder probe in 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/overview | title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission Overview | publisher=NASA[/tpl]

The fifth mission extension was granted in October 2007, and ran to the end of 2009.Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Press Releases The total cost of the first four mission extensions was $104 million, and the fifth mission extension is expected to cost at least $20 million.
In July 2007, during the fourth mission extension, Martian dust storms blocked sunlight to the rovers and threatened the ability of the craft to gather energy through their solar panels, causing engineers to fear that one or both of them might be permanently disabled. However, the dust storms lifted, allowing them to resume operations.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070824.html | title = Mars Exploration Rover Status Report: Rovers Resume Driving | publisher = nasa.gov | accessdate = 2007-09-03[/tpl]

In recognition of the vast amount of scientific information amassed by both rovers, two asteroids have been named in their honor: 37452 Spirit and 39382 Opportunity. The mission is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which designed, built, and is operating the rovers.
On January 24, 2014, NASA reported that current studies by the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable.[tpl]cite journal|last=Grotzinger |first=John P.|title=Introduction to Special Issue - Habitability, Taphonomy, and the Search for Organic Carbon on Mars|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/386 |journal=Science |date=January 24, 2014 |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=386–387 |doi=10.1126/science.1249944|accessdate=January 24, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |authors=Various|title=Special Issue - Table of Contents - Exploring Martian Habitability|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169.toc#SpecialIssue|date=January 24, 2014|journal=Science |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=345–452|accessdate=January 24, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |authors=Various |title=Special Collection - Curiosity - Exploring Martian Habitability|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/extra/curiosity/|date=January 24, 2014 |journal=Science |accessdate=January 24, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|authors=Grotzinger, J.P. et al. |title=A Habitable Fluvio-Lacustrine Environment at Yellowknife Bay, Gale Crater, Mars |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1242777 |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=Science |volume=343 |number=6169 |doi=10.1126/science.1242777 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 [/tpl] The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective.

[[Pretty Together]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 albums, Sloan albums, Murderecords albums

Pretty Together is the sixth album by Canadian rock group Sloan.  It was released on Murderecords in 2001, and is often seen as the band's most mature album.  While it still has the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1990s influences of Between the Bridges, it is more melancholy with fewer of the upbeat songs found on previous albums. 'If It Feels Good Do It' and 'The Other Man' were the two major singles from the album, with the latter being a melancholy plea by Chris Murphy which marked an outing from the usual upbeat songs Murphy provides the group with. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2002 Juno Awards.
From this album, "If It Feels Good Do It" and "The Other Man" were released as singles. Although the album did not chart or do well in sales, both singles received notable radio airplay.

[[The Long Run (Eagles album)]]
CATEGORIES: Eagles (band) albums, 1979 albums, Elektra Records albums, Asylum Records albums, Albums produced by Bill Szymczyk

The Long Run is the sixth studio album by the American rock group the Eagles, released in 1979. This was the first Eagles album not to feature founding member Randy Meisner, who was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit. This was also the last studio album until 2007's Long Road Out of Eden, the final studio album for Asylum Records, and the last studio album to include Don Felder.
The album was originally intended to be a double LP album to be released in 1978 but was instead released as a single LP. Some of the tracks that were left off the album would be cobbled together to compose the cut "Long Run Leftovers" which appeared on the band's 2000 box set Selected Works: 1972-1999. Some of the bits in "Long Run Leftovers" were resurrected by Joe Walsh on "Rivers (of the Hidden Funk)" from 1981's There Goes the Neighborhood and "Told You So" on 1983's You Bought It, You Name It.
Also, the band recorded a Christmas single during the sessions, the first of which was a cover of "Please Come Home For Christmas" by Charles Brown (released as a single in November 1978). The song's B-side was a Don Henley and Glenn Frey original called "Funky New Year"—the band's song about the pitfalls of celebrating New Year's Day.
The Long Run took almost two years to complete and saw the Eagles move in a more hard rock direction that they started going in with its predecessor, 1976's Hotel California.
When released in September 1979, The Long Run debuted at #2 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart and a week later hit #1 dethroning Led Zeppelin's In Through the Out Door. It was the last #1 album of the 1970s, and reigned for eight weeks in the #1 slot. "The Long Run" has sold more than seven million copies to date in the US alone (it was certified Gold and Platinum in early 1980 by the R.I.A.A.).
The album generated three Top 10 singles, the chart-topping rocker "Heartache Tonight", the album's title cut, and the ballad "I Can't Tell You Why". Those singles reached #1, #8, and #8 respectively. The band also won a Grammy for "Heartache Tonight". Also on the record was "In the City", a song first recorded by guitarist Joe Walsh for the movie soundtrack for The Warriors. "The Sad Cafe" (about the band's experiences at The Troubadour in Los Angeles) and "Those Shoes" also received substantial radio airplay.

[[Ligne claire]]

CATEGORIES: Comics terminology, Franco-Belgian comics

Ligne claire (French for "clear line") is a style of drawing pioneered by Hergé, the Belgian creator of The Adventures of Tintin. It uses clear strong lines of uniform importance. Artists working in it do not use hatching, while contrast is downplayed as well. Cast shadows are often illuminated while a uniformity of line is used throughout, paying equal attention to every element depicted. Additionally, the style often features strong colours and a combination of cartoonish characters against a realistic background. All these elements together can result in giving strips drawn this way a flat aspect. The name was coined by Joost Swarte in 1977.Pleban, Dafna.

[[Cameo (carving)]]

CATEGORIES: Jewellery components, Types of sculpture, Glass art, Hardstone carving

Cameo is a method of carving an object such as an engraved gem, item of jewellery or vessel made in this manner. It nearly always features a raised (positive) relief image; contrast with intaglio, which has a negative image. Originally, and still in discussing historical work, cameo only referred to works where the relief image was of a contrasting colour to the background; this was achieved by carefully carving a piece of material with a flat plane where two contrasting colours met, removing all the first colour except for the image to leave a contrasting background.
Today the term may be used very loosely for objects with no colour contrast, and other, metaphorical, terms have developed, such as cameo appearance. This derives from another generalized meaning that has developed, the cameo as an image of a head in an oval frame in any medium, such as a photograph.

[[Birthmark]]

CATEGORIES: Skin

A birthmark is a benign irregularity on the skin which is present at birth or appears shortly after birth, usually in the first month. They can occur anywhere on the skin.[tpl]DorlandsDict|one/000012925|birthmark[/tpl] Birthmarks are caused by overgrowth of blood vessels, melanocytes, smooth muscle, fat, fibroblasts, or keratinocytes.
Dermatologists divide birthmarks into two types. Pigmented birthmarks caused by excess skin pigment cells include moles, café-au-lait spots, and Mongolian spots. Vascular birthmarks (also called red birthmarks) are caused by increased blood vessels and include macular stains (salmon patches), hemangiomas, and Port-wine stains. A little over 1 in 10 babies have a vascular birthmark present by age 1. Several birthmark types are part of the group of skin lesions known as nevi or naevi, which means "birthmarks" in Latin.
The exact cause of most birthmarks is unknown, but vascular birthmarks are not hereditary. They are thought to occur as a result of a localized imbalance in factors controlling the development and migration of skin cells.

[[Fairy chess]]

CATEGORIES: Fairy chess

Fairy chess comprises chess problems that differ from classical (also called orthodox) chess problems in that they are not direct mates. The term was introduced by Henry Tate in 1914 and has resisted change since then. While selfmate dates from the Middle Ages, helpmate was invented by Max Lange in the late 19th century. Thomas Dawson (1889–1951), the "father of fairy chess",[ref]

With its ornate 19th century buildings, large avenues, prestigious schools, museums and various parks, the arrondissement has long been known as one of French high society's favorite places of residence (comparable to New York's Upper East Side or London's Kensington and Chelsea)http://www.parislogue.com/places-in-paris/deciphering-the-16th-arrondissement.html eyes of an American-born on the exclusive 16th to such an extent that the  phrase "le 16e" ([tpl]IPA-fr|lə sɛzjɛm[/tpl]) has been associated with great wealth in French popular culture. Indeed, the 16th arrondissement is France's fourth richest district for average household income, following the 8th, 7th and 6th arrondissements; with the south of the 17th arrondissement and Neuilly-sur-Seine, they form the most affluent and prestigious residential area in France.
The 16th arrondissement hosts several large sporting venues, including: the Parc des Princes, which is the stadium where Paris Saint-Germain football club plays its home matches; Roland Garros Stadium, where the French Open tennis championships are held; and Stade Jean-Bouin, home to the Stade Français rugby union club.

Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610 (Vespers for the Blessed Virgin, 1610; SV 206 and 206a) — commonly called Vespers of 1610 — is a musical composition by Claudio Monteverdi. The term "Vespers" (evening prayers) is taken from the Hours of the Divine Office, a set of daily prayers of the Catholic Church which have remained structurally unchanged for 1500 years.  In scale, Monteverdi's Vespers was the most ambitious work of religious music before Bach. This 90-minute piece includes soloists, chorus, and orchestra and has both liturgical and extra-liturgical elements. 
Vespers is composed around several Biblical texts that are traditionally used as part of the liturgy for several Marian feasts in the Roman Catholic church: the introductory Deus in adjutorium (Psalm 69), five Psalm settings, sacred motets (called “concerti”) between the Psalms, a traditional Hymn, a setting of the Magnificat text and the concluding Benedicamus Domino.

Robert Stephenson FRS (16 October 1803 – 12 October 1859) was an early railway engineer. The only son of George Stephenson, the "Father of Railways",[tpl]sfn|Davis|1975|loc=Title of book[/tpl] he built on the achievements of his father. Robert has been called the greatest engineer of the 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/robert-stephenson|title=Robert Stephenson|publisher=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=19 March 2014[/tpl]
Robert was born in Willington Quay, Northumberland, to George and Frances née Henderson, before they moved to Killingworth, where Robert was taught at the local village school. Robert attended the middle-class Percy Street Academy in Newcastle and at the age of fifteen was apprenticed to the mining engineer Nicholas Wood. He left before he had completed his three years to help his father survey the Stockton and Darlington Railway. Robert spent six months at Edinburgh University before working for three years as a mining engineer in Colombia. When he returned his father was building the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and Robert developed the steam locomotive Rocket that won the Rainhill Trials in 1829. He was appointed chief engineer of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1833 with a salary of £1,500 per annum. By 1850 Robert had been involved in third of the country's railway system. He designed the High Level Bridge and Royal Border Bridge on the East Coast Main Line. With Eaton Hodgkinson and William Fairbairn he developed wrought-iron tubular bridges, such the Britannia Bridge in Wales, a design he would later use for the Victoria Bridge in Montreal, for many years the longest bridge in the world. He eventually worked on 160 commissions from 60 companies, building railways in other countries such as Belgium, Norway, Egypt and France.[tpl]cite book|editor-last=Bailey|editor-first=Michael R.|year=2003|title=Robert Stephenson; The Eminent Engineer|publisher= Ashgate|isbn=0-7546-3679-8|page=XXIII[/tpl]
In 1829 Robert married Frances Sanderson who died in 1842; the couple had no children and he did not remarry. In 1847 he was elected Member of Parliament for Whitby, and held the seat until his death. Although Robert declined a British knighthood, he was decorated in Belgium with the Knight of the Order of Leopold, in France with the Knight of the Legion of Honour and in Norway with the Knight Grand Cross of the order of St. Olaf. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849. He served as President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and Institution of Civil Engineers. Robert's death was widely mourned, and his funeral cortege was given permission by Queen Victoria to pass through Hyde Park, an honour previously reserved for royalty. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.

[[Old wives' tale]]

CATEGORIES: Urban legends, Public opinion, Folklore

Old wives' tale is a derogatory epithet used to indicate that a supposed truth is actually a superstition or something untrue, to be ridiculed. The phrase comes with the assumption that a story told by old women could not have credibility, regardless of the particulars of the story. The phrase is used in the context of unvalued women's knowledge.  It can be said sometimes to be a type of urban legend, said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such "tales" are considered superstition, folklore or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Today, some "old wives' tales" have proven to be valid. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, pregnancy, puberty, social relations, health, herbalism and nutrition.

[[Ecological model of competition]]
CATEGORIES: Business intelligence, Economic theories, Market research, Strategic management, Competition

The ecological model of competition is a reassessment of the nature of competition in the economy. Traditional economics models the economy on the principles of physics (force, equilibrium, inertia, momentum, and linear relationships). This can be seen in the economics lexicon: terms like labour force, market equilibrium, capital flows, and  price elasticity. This is probably due to historical coincidence. Classical Newtonian physics was the state of the art in science when Adam Smith was formulating the first principles of economics in the 18th century.
According to the ecological model, it is more appropriate to model the economy on biology (growth, change, death, evolution, survival of the fittest, complex inter-relationships, non-linear relationships). Businesses operate in a complex environment with interlinked sets of determinants. Companies co-evolve: they influence, and are influenced by, competitors, customers, governments, investors, suppliers, unions, distributors, banks, and others. We should look at this business environment as a business ecosystem that both sustains, and threatens the firm. A company that is not well matched to its environment might not survive. Companies that are able to develop a successful business model and turn a core competency into a sustainable competitive advantage will thrive and grow. Very successful firms may come to dominate their industry (referred to as category killers).

[[Shoot 'em up]]

CATEGORIES: Shoot 'em ups, Video game genres, Video game terminology

Shoot 'em up (also known as shmup or STG) is a subgenre of the shooter genre of video games.
In a shoot 'em up, the player character engages in a lone assault, often in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up.[tpl]fact|date=May 2013[/tpl] Some[tpl]who|date=May 2013[/tpl] restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives. Shoot 'em ups call for fast reactions and for the player to memorise levels and enemy attack patterns. "Bullet hell" games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles.
The genre's origins can be traced back to Spacewar!, one of the very earliest computer games, developed in 1961 and eventually released in amusement arcades in the early 1970s. However, Tomohiro Nishikado, creator of Space Invaders, is generally credited with inventing the genre. Space Invaders premiered in Japanese arcades in 1978. Shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s, and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts, particularly in Japan.

[[Running gag]]

CATEGORIES: Running gags, In-jokes, Narrative techniques

A running gag, or running joke, is a literary device that takes the form of an amusing joke or a comical reference and appears repeatedly throughout a work of literature or other form of storytelling.
Running gags can begin with an instance of unintentional humor that is repeated in variations as the joke grows familiar and audiences anticipate reappearances of the gag. The humor in a running gag may derive entirely from how often it is repeated, the (in)appropriateness of the situation in which the gag occurs, or setting up the audience to expect another occurrence of the joke and then substituting something else (bait and switch). Running gags are found mostly in television shows, but also appear in other places, such as video games, films, books, and comic strips.
A running gag can be verbal or visual and may "convey social values by echoing belligerent speakers with a barrage of caricatured threats."[tpl]cite book|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|title=American Folklore : An Encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Humanities ; Vol. 1551|publisher=New York Garland, 1998|page=812 |isbn=978-0-8153-3350-0|page=719[/tpl] For example, a character may present others with a proposition that is so ridiculous or outrageous it is likely to be self-mocking to the point where the original request has little or no chance of actually being carried out and results in a humorous effect. Occasionally, the characters themselves may be aware of the running gag and make humorous mention of it.

CATEGORIES: Prostitution in New Zealand, Organisations based in New Zealand, Sex worker organizations

The New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective (NZPC) is a New Zealand-based organisation that supports the rights of sex workers and educates prostitutes about minimizing the risks of the job. It was founded in 1987, and received funding from the Minister of Health in 1988. One of its founding members was Catherine Healy, who remained NZPC's national coordinator in 2012. The funding contract was subsequently managed by the Department of Health, and later, the Ministry of Health, following reorganisation within the Ministry.Healy, C., Bennachie, C., & Reed, A., (2010).

Bristol: Policy Press. It has been credited with controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS in New Zealand. It successfully convinced the New Zealand Labour Party-led Helen Clark administration to pass the Prostitution Reform Act 2003, which decriminalised most forms of adult prostitution in New Zealand, despite opposition from the Maxim Institute and other New Zealand Christian Right organisations of the time.

[[Prostitution in New Zealand]]

CATEGORIES: Prostitution in New Zealand

Prostitution (sex work), brothel keeping, living off the proceeds of someone else's prostitution and street solicitation are legal in New Zealand. Coercion of sex workers is illegal.Section 16, Prostitution Reform Act 2003.
Prior to 2003, indoor prostitution in New Zealand was governed by the Massage Parlours Act 1978, which allowed brothels to operate in the guise of massage parlours. However, the act defined massage parlours as public places, so laws against soliciting in a public place applied to workers in parlours, and they were sometimes raided and entrapped by police posing as clients. Workers in the parlours were also required to provide their names and addresses to the police. Advertising the sale of sex ("soliciting"), running a brothel, and living off the earnings of prostitution were illegal. These laws were changed by the Prostitution Reform Act, passed in June 2003. The decriminalisation of brothels, escort agencies and soliciting, and the substitution of a minimal regulatory model created worldwide interest; New Zealand prostitution laws are now some of the most liberal in the world. (See Prostitution and the law).
Although prior to 2003 New Zealand had several laws meant to suppress prostitution, during the last decades of the 20th century, there had been a high degree of toleration of sex work in practice. Nevertheless, police continued to raid brothels, streets, and private residences of sex workers right up to the day before the Prostitution Reform Bill was passed by Parliament.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

Squidward Tentacles is a fictional character in the American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. He is voiced by actor Rodger Bumpass, and first appeared on television in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999. Squidward was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg.
Squidward is an anthropomorphic octopus who lives in a moai between SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star's houses. Portrayed as being ill-tempered, pretentious, cynical, and grouchy, he strongly despises his neighbors for their constant boisterous, noisy behavior; however, the pair are unaware of Squidward's antipathy, for them and see him as a friend. Squidward works as a cashier at the Krusty Krab. His species is an octopus according to the show creator, despite his name containing the word squid. Hillenburg made Squidward with six tentacles, believing that "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight."
Critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans has been positive. Squidward has appeared in other media, such as trading cards, video games, plush toys and comic books. He also appears in the 2004 full-length feature film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, and in its sequel that is scheduled for release on February 13, 2015.

[tpl]nihongo|Mobile Fighter G Gundam|機動武闘伝Gガンダム|Kidō Butōden Jī Gandamu|lit. "Mobile Fighting Legend G Gundam"[/tpl], is an animated television series produced by Sunrise. The series is set in the "Future Century", where space colonies representing countries have agreed to hold an organized fighting tournament known as the "Gundam Fight" every four years to settle their political differences in place of war. Each colony sends a representative fighter piloting a giant, humanoid mecha called a Gundam to battle on Earth until only one is left, and the winning nation earns the right to govern over all the colonies until the next tournament.  The events of G Gundam follow Domon Kasshu, the pilot of Neo Japan's Shining Gundam during the 13th Gundam Fight. Domon's mission is to both win the tournament and to track down his older brother, who had stolen the mysterious Dark Gundam from the Neo Japan government.
Commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Gundam brand, G Gundam was produced to reboot the waning popularity of the long-running franchise. It is the first Gundam series with a self-contained plot set in an alternate continuity from the original "Universal Century" timeline. Additionally, the show casts aside many of the conventions set by its predecessors and takes many new steps for its franchise, such as a focus on martial arts and decisive, personal duels as opposed to large-scale military conflicts. G Gundam was directed by Yasuhiro Imagawa, with its settings and characters significantly influenced by the director's interest in world cinema. The anime's real world locales were drawn from numerous foreign films and were planned using location scouting. G Gundam ran for 49 episodes on Japan's TV Asahi from April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995. An English-language version licensed by Bandai Entertainment aired on the United States channel Cartoon Network beginning on August 5, 2002. Since its original broadcast, G Gundam has spawned manga, audio albums, video games, guide books, and several lines of scale models.
During its conception and Japanese television debut, G Gundam was met with controversy among its production staff, sponsors, and fans because the show takes a wildly different turn from all previous entries in the Gundam universe. However, for that very reason the series is cited as a milestone in its long-running franchise and ultimately proved very popular in the region. Reception for G Gundam has been generally positive in North America. Reviewers praised the primary characters and mecha as unique and stylized, but strongly disagreed on the plot. While some critics enjoyed the bold and campy divergence from the more dramatic social and political undertones traditional of Gundam, others found G Gundam[tpl]'[/tpl]s story diffusely shallow, repetitive, or not up to standards set by its anime predecessors.

[tpl]nihongo|Turn A Gundam, stylized as ∀ Gundam|∀（ターンエー）ガンダム|Tān Ē Gandamu[/tpl] is a 50 episode anime series that aired between 1999 and 2000 on Japan's FNN networks, which was created for the Gundam Big Bang 20th Anniversary celebration. It was also compiled into two feature-length movies entitled Turn A Gundam I: Earth Light and Turn A Gundam II: Moonlight Butterfly.
Turn A Gundam was directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, who was the main creator of the Gundam franchise and had written and directed many previous Gundam works. This series was made after Tomino had recovered from his depression that had influenced Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, and the general tone and mood of Turn A Gundam is much more hopeful and less dark than his other Gundam series.
Turn A Gundam is also the last of the Gundam metaseries (not counting the compilations and future video game cut scenes) to be hand painted on cels. Gundam SEED, created in 2002, was the first series to use digital coloring.
On 22 July 2010, Bandai Entertainment announced that they had acquired the license to release Turn A Gundam in the United StatesAnime News Network: Bandai Ent. Adds Tales of the Abyss, Turn A Gundam.

[tpl]Nihongo|Mobile Suit Gundam SEED|機動戦士ガンダムSEED (シード)|Kidō Senshi Gandamu Shīdo[/tpl] is an anime series developed by Sunrise and directed by Mitsuo Fukuda. As with other series from the Gundam franchise, Gundam SEED takes place in a parallel timeline, in this case the Cosmic Era, the first to do so. In this era, mankind has developed into two subspecies: Naturals, who reside on Earth and Coordinators, genetically-enhanced humans capable of withstanding the rigors of space who inhabit orbital colonies. The story revolves around a young Coordinator Kira Yamato who becomes involved in the war between the two races after a neutral space colony is invaded by the Coordinators.
The television series was broadcast in Japan between 2002 and 2003, on the Tokyo Broadcasting System and Mainichi Broadcasting System networks, beginning a broadcast partnership with the Gundam franchise that lasted until Mobile Suit Gundam AGE ended its run in 2013. The series spawned three compilations films and was adapted into a manga as well as various light novels. A sequel series, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny followed in 2004. Various types of merchandising have also been released, including models, CD soundtracks and video games. Gundam SEED was licensed by Bandai Entertainment for broadcast in North America, and began airing in the United States and Canada in 2004 and 2005 respectively. The films and the sequel were also licensed by Bandai. The manga and light novels as well as the spin off series, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray, were also licensed. A number of video games were also released in North America.
Mobile Suit Gundam SEED was widely popular with the public in Japan, winning numerous awards, with high sales of both the series DVD and music. The character development and animation has gained praise, but similarities with previous Gundam series have drawn both comparisons and criticism from Gundam fans.

Betty Friedan (February 4, 1921 – February 4, 2006) was an American writer, activist, and feminist. A leading figure in the women's movement in the United States, her 1963 book The Feminine Mystique is often credited with sparking the second wave of American feminism in the 20th century. In 1966, Friedan founded and was elected the first president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), which aimed to bring women "into the mainstream of American society now in fully equal partnership with men".
In 1970, after stepping down as NOW's first president, Friedan organized the nationwide Women's Strike for Equality on August 26, the 50th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution granting women the right to vote. The national strike was successful beyond expectations in broadening the feminist movement; the march led by Friedan in New York City alone attracted over 50,000 women and men. In 1971, Friedan joined other leading feminists to establish the National Women's Political Caucus. Friedan was also a strong supporter of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution that passed the United States House of Representatives (by a vote of 354–24) and Senate (84–8) following intense pressure by women's groups led by NOW in the early 1970s. Following Congressional passage of the amendment, Friedan advocated for ratification of the amendment in the states and supported other women's rights reforms: she founded the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws but was later critical of the abortion-centered positions of many liberal feminists.
Regarded as an influential author and intellectual in the United States, Friedan remained active in politics and advocacy for the rest of her life, authoring six books. As early as the 1960s Friedan was critical of polarized and extreme factions of feminism that attacked groups such as men and homemakers. One of her later books, The Second Stage (1981), critiqued what Friedan saw as the extremist excesses of some feminists who could be broadly classified as gender feminists.

The Governor of Indiana is the chief executive of the state of Indiana. The governor is elected to a four-year term, and responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the functions of many agencies of the Indiana state government.

The 50th and current governor is Mike Pence, a Republican.
The position of governor has developed over the course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the Indiana General Assembly and Indiana Supreme Court to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts in most other states.

The Governor of the State of Kansas is the head of state for the State of Kansas, United States. Under the Kansas Constitution, the Governor is also the head of government, serving as the chief executive of the Kansas executive branch, of the government of Kansas.

Despite being an executive branch official, the Governor also possesses legislative and judicial powers. The Governor's responsibilities include making yearly "State of the State" addresses to the Kansas Legislature, submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and that the peace is preserved.
The office was created in 1861 when  Kansas was officially admitted to the United States as the 34th state. Prior to statehood in 1861, the office was preceded by a Presidential appointed Governor of Kansas Territory with similar powers.
The 46th and current Governor of Kansas is Sam Brownback. His term began on January 11, 2011. He succeeded Mark Parkinson, who began his term on April 28, 2009 when Kathleen Sebelius resigned upon the US Senate vote confirming her as Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Elections occur at the same time as the Congressional midterm elections, and each term begins on the second Monday of January following the election.  The lieutenant governor is subject to the same limitations and runs on a combined ticket with the governor.Constitution of the State of Kansas

[[Governor of Kentucky]]

CATEGORIES: Commonwealth constitutional officers of Kentucky, Governors of Kentucky, 1792 establishments in the United States

The Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is the head of the executive branch of government in the U.S. state of Kentucky. Fifty-six men and one woman have served as Governor of Kentucky. The governor's term is four years in length; since 1992, incumbents have been able to seek re-election once before becoming ineligible for four years. Throughout the state's history, four men have served two non-consecutive terms as governor, and two others have served two consecutive terms. Kentucky is one of only five U.S. states that hold gubernatorial elections in odd-numbered years immediately before the United States Presidential Election. The current governor is Steve Beshear, who was first elected in 2007 and was re-elected in 2011. He is term-limited, and cannot seek re-election in 2015.
The governor's powers are enumerated in the state constitution. There have been four constitutions of Kentucky—adopted in 1792, 1799, 1850, and 1891 respectively—and each has enlarged the governor's authority. Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons, veto legislation, and call the legislature into session. The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state. The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch, limited somewhat by the adoption of a merit system for state employees in 1960. Because Kentucky's governor controls so many appointments to commissions, the office has been historically considered one of the most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, the governor's influence has been augmented by wide discretion in awarding state contracts and significant influence over the legislature, although the latter has been waning since the mid-1970s.
The history of the office of Governor is largely one of long periods of domination by a single party, though different parties were predominant in different eras. Federalists were rare among Kentuckians during the period of the First Party System, and Democratic Republicans won every gubernatorial election in the state until 1828. The Second Party System began when the Democratic-Republicans split into Jacksonian Democrats (the predecessor of the modern Democratic Party) and National Republicans (later to become Whigs). Beginning with the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828, the Whigs dominated the governorship until 1851, with John Breathitt being the only Democrat elected during that period. With the collapse of the Whig Party in the 1850s, Democrats took control of the governorship for the duration of the Third Party System, with Charles S. Morehead of the Know Nothing Party being the only exception. The election of Republican William O'Connell Bradley in 1895 began the only period of true two party competition for the governorship; from Bradley's election through 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor of Kentucky. Since 1931, only three Republicans have served as governor of Kentucky; Ernie Fletcher, who served from 2003 to 2007, was the most recent.

The five-member Executive Council has a veto over many actions of the governor. Together, the Governor and Executive Council approve contracts with a value of $5,000 or more, approve pardons, and appoint the directors and commissioners, judges, the Attorney General and officers in the National Guard.

CATEGORIES: ARPANET, American inventions, History of the Internet

The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was one of the world's first operational packet switching networks, the first network to implement TCP/IP, and the progenitor of what was to become the global Internet. The network was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) within the U.S. Department of Defense for use by its projects at universities and research laboratories in the US. The packet switching of the ARPANET, together with TCP/IP, would form the backbone of how the Internet works. The packet switching was based on concepts and designs by American engineer Paul Baran, British scientist Donald Davieshttp://www.thocp.net/biographies/davies_donald.htmhttp://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/donald-davies and Lawrence Roberts of the Lincoln Laboratory.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_roberts.htm|title=Lawrence Roberts Manages The ARPANET Program |work=Living Internet.com |accessdate=6 November 2008[/tpl].

[tpl]About|the youngest son of George V|other uses|Prince John (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Prince John[/tpl]

Prince John of the United Kingdom (John Charles Francis; 12 July 1905 – 18 January 1919) was the fifth son and youngest of the six children of King George V and his wife, Queen Mary. At the time of John's birth, his father was the Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, Edward VII. In 1910, George succeeded to the throne upon Edward's death and John became fifth in the line of succession.
In 1909, John was discovered to be afflicted by epilepsy and was also believed to suffer from some form of intellectual disability or even autism. As his condition deteriorated, he was sent to live at Sandringham House and was kept away from the public eye. There, he was cared for by his governess, "Lala" Bill and befriended local children whom his mother had gathered to be his playmates. Prince John died at Sandringham in 1919, following a severe seizure, and was buried at nearby St Mary Magdalene Church. His illness was released to the wider public only after his death.
Prince John's seclusion has subsequently been brought forward as evidence for the inhumanity of the royal family. However, records show that the Prince was in some ways given favourable treatment by his parents, in comparison to his siblings, and his mother had love and concern for him.

The Electorate of Mainz (Kurfürstentum Mainz or Kurmainz), also known in English by its French name, Mayence, was the most prestigious and among the most influential states of the Holy Roman Empire from its creation to the dissolution of the HRE in the early years of the 19th century. In the Roman Catholic hierarchy, the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz was the Primate of Germany (primas Germaniae), a purely honorary dignity that was unsuccessfully claimed from time to time by other Archbishops. There were only two other ecclesiastical Prince-electors in the Empire: the Electorate of Cologne and the Electorate of Trier.
The Archbishop-Elector of Mainz was also archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire and, as such, ranked first among all ecclesiastical and secular princes of the Empire, and was second only to the Emperor. His political role, particularly as an intermediary between the Estates of the Empire and the Emperor, was considerable.Lafage, p. 69

The text describes her as being intelligent (gáeth), cunning (trebar) and "versed in the knowledge and power of the Túatha Dé Danand", explaining that her fosterfather had been the wizard druid Bresal Etarlám.Gantz, Early Irish Myths and Sagas. pp. 44-5. Óengus warns Midir that she is "a woman of dreadful sorcery, a woman of all the knowledge and skill and power of her people." p. 44. She is said to be of the progeny (clann) of Béothach son of Iardanél, who is probably identical with Béothach son of Iarbonel, the father of the Túatha Dé Danann in the Lebor Gabála Érenn.

The Electorate of Cologne ([tpl]lang-de|Kurfürstentum Köln[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|de|Kurköln[/tpl]) was an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire and existed from the 10th to the early 19th century. It consisted of the temporal possessions of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne  ([tpl]Lang-de|Erzbistum Köln[/tpl]). It was ruled by the Archbishop in his capacity as prince-elector. There were only two other ecclesiastical prince-electors in the Empire: the Electorate of Mainz and the Electorate of Trier, among which Mainz ranked first.
The capital of the electorate was Cologne until the Elector moved to Bonn (after the 1288 defeat) to avoid jurisdiction conflicts with the authorities of the Free City of Cologne, who largely escaped its authority. The Electorate was secularized in 1803 during the German Mediatisation.
The territory of the Electorate of Cologne was smaller than the Archdiocese of Cologne, which included suffragant bishoprics such as Liège and Munster (see map below).

[[Porter five forces analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Michael Porter, Management, Strategic management, Business planning

Porter five forces analysis is a framework for industry analysis and business strategy development. It draws upon industrial organization (IO) economics to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and therefore attractiveness of a market. Attractiveness in this context refers to the overall industry profitability. An "unattractive" industry is one in which the combination of these five forces acts to drive down overall profitability. A very unattractive industry would be one approaching "pure competition", in which available profits for all firms are driven to normal profit. This analysis is associated with its principal innovator Michael E. Porter presently at Harvard University as of 2014.
Three of Porter's five forces refer to competition from external sources. The remainder are internal threats.
Porter referred to these forces as the micro environment, to contrast it with the more general term macro environment. They consist of those forces close to a company that affect its ability to serve its customers and make a profit.  A change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to re-assess the marketplace given the overall change in industry information. The overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every firm in the industry will return the same profitability. Firms are able to apply their core competencies, business model or network to achieve a profit above the industry average. A clear example of this is the airline industry. As an industry, profitability is low and yet individual companies, by applying unique business models, have been able to make a return in excess of the industry average.
Porter's five forces include - three forces from 'horizontal' competition: the threat of substitute products or services, the threat of established rivals, and the threat of new entrants; and two forces from 'vertical' competition: the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.
This five forces analysis, is just one part of the complete Porter strategic models. The other elements are the value chain and the generic strategies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
Porter developed his Five Forces analysis in reaction to the then-popular SWOT analysis, which he found unrigorous and ad hoc.Michael Porter, Nicholas Argyres, Anita M. McGahan, "An Interview with Michael Porter", The Academy of Management Executive 16:2:44 at JSTOR  Porter's five forces is based on the Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm in industrial organizational economics.  It has been applied to a diverse range of problems, from helping businesses become more profitable to helping governments stabilize industries.Michael Simkovic, Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization

They condemn denominationalism and instruct believers to meet together with no name or basis other than the city or locality in which they reside. They emphasize the subjective experience of Christ as well as the Biblical truths regarding Christ and the church.

[[Nontrinitarianism]]

CATEGORIES: Nontrinitarianism, Christianity-related controversies, Unitarianism, Schisms in Christianity, Christian terms

Nontrinitarianism (or antitrinitarianism) refers to monotheistic belief systems, primarily within Christianity, which reject the mainstream Christian doctrine of the Trinity, namely, the teaching that God is three distinct hypostases or persons who are co-eternal, co-equal, and indivisibly united in one being or ousia.
According to churches that consider ecumenical council decisions final, trinitarianism was infallibly defined at the 4th-century ecumenical councils,Roger E. Olson, Christopher Alan Hall (Eerdmans 2002 ISBN 978-0-80284827-7), p. 15Roger E.

Livingstone (editors), The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19280290-3), entry: "Arianism" disagreed with the Trinitarian formula of the Council of Nicaea. Nontrinitarians disagree with the findings of the Trinitarian Councils for various reasons, including the belief that the writings of the Bible take precedence over creeds (a view shared by the mainline Protestant churches, which on the contrary uphold the doctrine of the Trinity) or that there was a Great Apostasy prior to the Council. Church and State in Europe and the Middle East suppressed nontrinitarian belief as heresy from the 4th to 18th century, notably with regard to Arianism,http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590747/Theodosius-Ihttp://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33 the teaching of Michael Servetushttp://www.xtimeline.com/evt/view.aspx?id=938690 and Catharism.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12976/Albigensian-Crusade Today nontrinitarians represent a minority of professed Christians.
Nontrinitarian views differ widely on the nature of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.

During World War II, Operation Pastel was the deception plan scheduled to protect Operation Olympic, the planned invasion of southern Japan. Pastel would have falsely portrayed a threat of an American-led invasion against ports in China via attacks on Taiwan. Parts of Operation Majestic, an operation declined due to Operation Olympic, were incorporated in Operation Pastel.

[[Scottish clan]]
CATEGORIES: History of Scotland, Kinship and descent, Scottish clans, Scottish families

A Scottish clan (from Gaelic [tpl]lang|gd|clann[/tpl], "progeny") is a kinship group among the Scottish people. Clans give a sense of shared identity and descent to members, and in modern times have an official structure recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, which regulates Scottish heraldry and coats of arms. Most clans have their own tartan patterns, usually dating from the 19th century, which members may incorporate into kilts or other clothing.
The modern image of clans, each with their own tartan and specific land, was promulgated by the Scottish author Sir Walter Scott and others. Historically, tartan designs were associated with Lowland and Highland districts whose weavers tended to produce cloth patterns favoured in those districts. By process of social evolution, it followed that the clans/families prominent in a particular district would wear the tartan of that district, and it was but a short step for that community to become identified by it.
Many clans have their own clan chief; those that do not are known as armigerous clans.
Clans generally identify with geographical areas originally controlled by their founders, sometimes with an ancestral castle and clan gatherings which form a regular part of the social scene. The most notable gathering of recent times was "The Gathering 2009" which included a "clan convention" in the Scottish parliament.[tpl]cite news|first=Hazel|last=Mollison|title=The Gathering is hailed big success after 50,000 flock to Holyrood Park|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/The-Gathering-is-hailed-.5495880.jp|work=Scotsman.com|accessdate=30 July 2009|date=27 July 2009[/tpl]
It is a common misconception that every person who bears a clan's name is a lineal descendant of the chiefs. Many clansmen although not related to the chief took the chief's surname as their own to show solidarity, or for basic protection, or for much needed sustenance.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/content/help/index.aspx?560| title=Scottish surnames or variants| author=www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk| publisher=Scotland's People| accessdate=28 January 2012| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/68gaK6xQw | archivedate = 2012-06-25| deadurl=no[/tpl]

[[House of Stuart]]

CATEGORIES: House of Stuart, European royal families

[tpl]pp-move-indef|small=yes[/tpl]

The House of Stewart (latterly gallicised to Stuart), is a European  royal house. Founded by Robert II of Scotland, the Stewarts first became monarchs of the Kingdom of Scotland during the late 14th century, and subsequently held the position of the Kings of England, Ireland, and Great Britain. Their patrilineal ancestors (from Brittany) had held the office of High Steward of Scotland since the 12th century, after arriving by way of Norman England. The dynasty inherited further territory by the 17th century which covered the entire British Isles, including the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland, also maintaining a claim to the Kingdom of France.
In total, nine Stewart monarchs ruled just Scotland from 1371 until 1603. After this there was a Union of the Crowns under James VI & I who had become the senior genealogical claimant to The Crown holdings of the extinct House of Tudor. Thus[tpl]clarify | reason = Unclear use of the word 'thus'[/tpl] there were six Stewart monarchs who ruled both England and Scotland as well as Ireland (although the later Stuart era was interrupted by an interregnum lasting from 1649 to 1660, as a result of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms). Additionally,[tpl]clarify | reason = Unclear use of the word 'additionally'. Not even clear at this stage whether Anne was a Stuart monarch.[/tpl] at the foundation of the Kingdom of Great Britain after the Acts of Union, which officially united England and Scotland politically, the first monarch was Anne, Queen of Great Britain. After her death, the kingdoms passed to the House of Hanover, under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Security 1704, which deprived the Catholic legitimist line of the Stewarts of the right to mount the throne.
During the reign of the Stewarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, modern and centralised state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, to the mid point of the Early modern period. Monarchs such as James IV were known for sponsoring exponents of the Northern Renaissance such as the poet Robert Henryson, and others. After the Stewarts gained control of all of Great Britain, the arts and sciences continued to develop; many of William Shakespeare's best known plays were authored during the Jacobean era, while institutions such as the Royal Society and Royal Mail were established during the reign of Charles II.

The Chinese Soviet Republic (CSR, [tpl]zh|t=中華蘇維埃共和國|s=中华苏维埃共和国|p=Zhōnghuá Sūwéi'āi Gònghéguó[/tpl]), also known as the Soviet Republic of China or the China Soviet Republic, is often referred to in historical sources as the Jiangxi Soviet (after its largest component territory, the Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet). It was established in November 1931 by future Communist Party of China leader Mao Zedong, General Zhu De and others, and it lasted until 1937. Discontiguous territories included the Northeastern Jiangxi, Hunan-Jiangxi, Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi, Hunan-Western Hubei, Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou, Shaanxi-Gansu, Szechuan-Shensi, Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Honghu and Haifeng-Lufeng Soviets.
Mao Zedong was both CSR state chairman and prime minister; he led the state and its government. Mao's tenure as head of a "small state within a state" gave him experience in mobile warfare and peasant organization; this experience helped him accomplish the Communist reunification of China during the late 1940s. The CSR was eventually destroyed by the Kuomintang (KMT)'s National Revolutionary Army in a series of 1934 encirclement campaigns.[tpl]cite web|title=Chinese Soviet Republic|url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History7366.html|work=cultural China|publisher=cultural-china.com|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=2007–2010[/tpl] Following the Xi'an Incident of December 1936, the Communists and Kuomintang formed an uneasy "United Front" to resist Japanese pressure, which led to the Communists recognizing at least for the moment Chiang Kai-shek as China's leader and the official dissolution of the Soviet Republic on 22 September 1937.

[[Algebraic curve]]
CATEGORIES: Algebraic curves

In mathematics, an algebraic curve or plane algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables. 
For example, the unit circle is an algebraic curve, being the set of zeros of the polynomial x2 + y2 − 1
Various technical considerations have led to consider that the complex zeros of a polynomial belong to the curve. Also, the notion of algebraic curve has been generalized to allow the coefficients of the defining polynomial and the coordinates of the points of the curve to belong to any field, leading to the following definition.
In algebraic geometry, a plane affine algebraic curve defined over a field k is the set of points of K2 whose coordinates are zeros of some bivariate polynomial with coefficients in k, where K is some algebraically closed extension of k. The points of the curve with coordinates in k are the k-points of the curve and, all together, are the k part of the curve.
More generally, one may consider algebraic curves that are not contained in the plane, but in a space of higher dimension. A curve that is not contained in some plane is called a skew curve. The simplest example of a skew algebraic curve is the twisted cubic. One may also consider algebraic curves contained in the projective space and even algebraic curves that are defined independently to any embedding in an affine or projective space. This leads to the most general definition of an algebraic curve:
In algebraic geometry, an algebraic curve is an algebraic variety of dimension one.

Slavery in the United States was the legal institution of chattel slavery that existed in the United States of America in the 18th and 19th centuries. Slavery had been practiced in British North America from early colonial days, and was recognized in the Thirteen Colonies at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. When the United States was founded, even though some free persons of color were present, the status of slave was largely limited to those of African descent, creating a system and legacy in which race played an influential role.  After the Revolutionary War, abolitionist sentiment gradually spread in the Northern states, while the rapid expansion of the cotton industry from 1800 led to the Southern states strongly identifying with slavery, and attempting to extend it into the new Western territories. The United States was polarized by slavery into slave and free states along the Mason-Dixon Line, which separated Maryland (slave) and Pennsylvania (free).
Although the international slave trade was prohibited from 1808, internal slave-trading continued, and the slave population would eventually peak at four million before abolition.Stephen D. Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research, Harvard University.

Of all 1,515,605 free families in the fifteen slave states in 1860, nearly 400,000 held slaves (roughly one in four, or 25%),1860 Census Results, The Civil War Home Page. amounting to 8% of all American families.American Civil War Census Data.  
As the West opened up, the Southern states believed they needed to keep a balance between the numbers of slave and free states, in order to maintain a balance of power in the United States Congress. The new territories acquired from Britain, France and Mexico were the subject of major political compromises. By 1850, the newly rich cotton-growing South was threatening to secede from the Union, and tensions continued to rise. With church ministers under pressure to preach the relevant policies, the Baptist and Methodist churches split into regional organizations. When Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election on a ticket of no new slave states, the South finally broke away to form the Confederacy. This marked the start of the Civil War, which caused a huge disruption of Southern life, with many slaves either escaping or being liberated by the Union armies. The war effectively ended slavery, before the Thirteenth Amendment (December 1865) formally outlawed the institution throughout the United States.

AM worked by generating and modifying short Lisp programs which were then interpreted as defining various mathematical concepts; for example, a program that tested equality between the length of two lists was considered to represent the concept of numerical equality, while a program that produced a list whose length was the product of the lengths of two other lists was interpreted as representing the concept of multiplication.  The system had elaborate heuristics for choosing which programs to extend and modify, based on the experiences of working mathematicians in solving mathematical problems.

[[Linguistic imperialism]]
CATEGORIES: Linguistic rights, Sociolinguistics

Linguistic imperialism, or language imperialism, refers to "the transfer of a dominant language to other people". The transfer is essentially a demonstration of power—traditionally, military power but also, in the modern world, economic power—and aspects of the dominant culture are usually transferred along with the language."Gerald Knowles, Encyclopædia Britannica.[tpl]full|date=July 2013[/tpl][tpl]clarify|date=November 2010[/tpl]
Since the early 1990s, linguistic imperialism has attracted attention among scholars of applied linguistics. In particular, Robert Phillipson's 1992 book, Linguistic Imperialism, has led to considerable debate about its merits and shortcomings.  Phillipson found denunciations of linguistic imperialism that dated back to Nazi critiques of the British Council, and to Soviet analyses of English as the language of world capitalism and  world domination.Phillipson, Robert (1992), p36.
Linguistic imperialism is often seen in the context of cultural imperialism.[tpl]by whom|date=July 2013[/tpl]

[[Impassibility]]
CATEGORIES: Social psychology, Self, Theology, Attributes of God in Christian theology

Impassibility (from Latin in-, "not", passibilis, "able to suffer, experience emotion") describes the theological doctrine that God does not experience pain or pleasure from the actions of another being. It has often been seen as a consequence of divine aseity, the idea that God is absolutely independent of any other being, i.e., in no way causally dependent. Being affected (literally made to have a certain emotion, affect) by the state or actions of another would seem to imply causal dependence.
Some theological systems portray God as a being expressive of many (or all) emotions. Other systems, mainly in Judaism and Islam, portray God as a being that does not experience suffering or any other emotion at all. However, in Christianity there is an ancient dispute about the impassibility of God (see Nestorianism). Still, it is understood in all Abrahamic religions, including Christianity, that God is not subject to temptation or sin at all, since sin is defined as rebellion against God's loving authority and holiness. Or one could see sin as rebellion to God's will in general, and while it is conceivable that an ordinary being could "rebel" against his own better wishes, God arguably cannot since he is all-powerful and all-wise and is therefore compelled by his own nature to follow his best wishes.

The network consists of six lines which radiate from Manchester city centre and terminate at Altrincham, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury, Didsbury, Eccles, and Rochdale. The system is owned by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) and operated and maintained under contract by RATP Group.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/ratp-buys-manchester-metrolink-operator.html |title=RATP buys Manchester Metrolink operator |date=2 August 2011 |work=Railway Gazette International |location =London[/tpl] Also referred to as Manchester Metrolink, 25 million passenger journeys were made on the system in 2012/13.
A light rail system for Greater Manchester was born of Greater Manchester County Council's obligations to provide "an integrated and efficient system of public transport" under its structure plan and the Transport Act 1968.[tpl]sfn|Holt|1992|pp=6–7[/tpl] Greater Manchester's public transport network suffered from poor north – south connections, exacerbated by the location of Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, which were unconnected and lay at opposing edges of central Manchester. Abandoning the monorail and underground options conceived in the 1960s and 1970s, light rail was proposed in 1982 as the best and most economical public transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area, and gathered support throughout the 1980s as an appropriate integrated commuter service. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992. This founded the United Kingdom's first modern street running rail system and its second operational public tram system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only heritage tram system in the UK which endured up to Metrolink's creation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/manchester/|publisher=Railway Technology|title=Manchester Metrolink, United Kingdom|accessdate=12 July 2013|year=2010[/tpl]

Expansion of Metrolink has been a key strategy of transport planners in Greater Manchester, who have overseen its development in successive projects, known as Phases 1, 2, 3a, 3b and 2CC, which, upon completion of Phases 3b and 2CC in 2016/17, will make Metrolink the largest light rail network in the United Kingdom, with [tpl]convert|60|mi|km|[/tpl] of track and 93 stops, handling an estimated 45 million passenger journeys a year.

The ''xungen'' movement is a cultural and literary movement in mainland China emphasizing local and minority cultures. It began in the late-1980s. Its premise is that the Cultural Revolution damaged a pluralistic Chinese identity that had existed for centuries, and that the reconstruction of that identity requires a healthy appreciation of local cultures.
The xungen movement bears some similarities with the Taiwanese localization movement in its rejection of a forcefully-imposed Chinese identity.

The list of mayors of Washington, D.C. is a reflection of the changing structure of its local government. From 1846 to 1871, three separate municipalities were located within the District of Columbia and each was governed separately: the City of Washington, Georgetown, and unincorporated territory known as Washington County. With the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, the three municipalities within the District of Columbia were abolished in favor of a single District government, whose chief executive was a territorial Governor. This office was abolished in 1874, and replaced with a three-member Board of Commissioners appointed by the President. This system existed until 1967, when it was replaced by a single mayor-commissioner and city council appointed by the President.  Finally, in 1974, the District of Columbia Home Rule Act allowed for District residents to elect their own mayor.
Currently, the Mayor of the District of Columbia is popularly elected to a four-year term with no term limits. Even though Washington, D.C. is not in a state, the city government also has certain state-level responsibilities, making some of the mayor's duties analogous to those of United States governors. The current mayor of Washington, D.C. is Vincent C. Gray, a Democrat, who has served in the role since January 2, 2011.
The lists on this page include all of the chief executives of the District of Columbia in their various forms.

Between 1929 and 1937, 15 partial crania, 11 mandibles, many teeth, some skeletal bones and large numbers of stone tools were discovered in the Lower Cave at Locality 1 of the Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, in China. Their age is estimated to be between 500,000 and 300,000 years old. (A number of fossils of modern humans were also discovered in the Upper Cave at the same site in 1933.) The most complete fossils, all of which were calvariae, are:
Most of the study on these fossils was done by Davidson Black until his death in 1934. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin took over until Franz Weidenreich replaced him and studied the fossils until he left China in 1941. The original fossils disappeared in 1941, but excellent casts and descriptions remain.

Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platform computer game produced by Reflections (Later known as Reflections Interactive) and published by Psygnosis in 1989. The original version was released for the Commodore Amiga but the game has been ported to many other systems.  The original Amiga release cost £35, an unheard of price for a video game in that era, but it did include a T-shirt in the box bearing a print of the box's artwork.
Psygnosis had published numerous side scrollers with high quality graphics prior to the release of Shadow of the Beast (most notably Obliterator). Shadow of the Beast, however, was considered revolutionary because its graphics, with many more colours on screen and up to twelve levels of parallax scrolling backdrops, were of a level rarely if ever seen before in action games. It was also notable for its atmospheric score composed by David Whittaker that used high-quality instrument samples.
Shadow of the Beast will be remade on the PlayStation 4.

Although both the Old World and New World porcupine families belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are quite different and are not closely related.

[[The Sons of Hercules]]
CATEGORIES: Film series, Peplum films, Motion picture television series

The Sons of Hercules was a syndicated Embassy Pictures television show that aired in the United States of America in the 1960s.  The series repackaged 14 Italian sword-and-sandal films by giving them a standardized theme song for the opening and closing titles, as well as a standard introductory narration attempting to relate the lead character in each film to the Greek demigod Hercules. These films however were not all originally made as "Hercules" films in Italy.  Although two of them did originally feature Hercules (and not his sons), four of the films were originally Maciste movies in Italy, two of them were originally Ursus movies, and the other six were just isolated gladiator or mythological hero movies not released theatrically in the US.

The sjambok (shăm-bŏk′, -bŭk′)[tpl]cite web|title=Sjambok|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sjambok|work=Freedictionary.com[/tpl] or litupa is a heavy leather whip. It is traditionally made from an adult hippopotamus (or rhinoceros) hide, but is also commonly made out of plastic.
A strip of the animal's hide is cut and carved into a strip 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) long, tapering from about [tpl]convert|1|in|mm|0[/tpl] thick at the handle to about [tpl]convert|3/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at the tip. This strip is then rolled until reaching a tapered-cylindrical form. The resulting whip is both flexible and durable. A plastic version was made for the South African Police Service, and effectively used for riot control.
The sjambok had a variety of uses, with the most obvious being cattle driving. It was heavily used by the Voortrekkers driving their oxen while migrating from the Cape of Good Hope. Even today, the sjambok is used by herdsmen to drive cattle. They are widely available in South Africa from informal traders to regular stores from a variety of materials, lengths and thicknesses. They are an effective weapon to kill snakes and ward off dogs and other attackers and are still carried in public by many black South Africans for self-defense. Many South African households keep a sjambok.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] 
In South Africa it is sometimes seen as synonymous with the apartheid era, but its use on people started much earlier. It is sometimes used outside the official judiciary by those who mete out discipline imposed by extralegal courts.[tpl]cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,319167,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Rough justice | first=Decca | last=Aitkenhead | date=2000-05-28 | accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl]

[[Sim (pencil game)]]
CATEGORIES: Ramsey theory, Mathematical games, Combinatorics, Combinatorial game theory, Paper-and-pencil games

The game of Sim is played by two players on a board consisting of six dots ('vertices').  Each dot is connected to every other dot by a line ('edge').
Two players take turns coloring any uncolored lines.  One player colors in one color, and the other colors in another color, with each player trying to avoid the creation of a triangle made solely of their color (only triangles with the dots as corners count; intersections of lines are not relevant); the player who completes such a triangle loses immediately.
The game of Sim cannot end in a tie. This can be shown with one's "hand", as follows: Let's identify any one of the dots as the "palm" and the others as the "fingertips". On the fully colored board at least three of the "fingers" (i.e., lines) connected to the palm obviously must be of the same color (otherwise take the other fingers...). If one of the lines connecting the tips of these three fingers has the same color, a triangle of this color is formed between the palm and these two fingertips. Otherwise, all three lines between the fingertips of the three fingers of the same color must be of the other color, and then they form a triangle of that color.
Ramsey theory can also be used to show that no game of Sim can end in a tie.  Specifically, since the Ramsey number R(3,3)=6, any two-coloring of the complete graph on 6 vertices (K6) must contain a monochromatic triangle, and therefore is not a tied position.  This will also apply to any super-graph of K6. For another proof that there must eventually be a triangle of either color, see the Theorem on friends and strangers.
Computer search has verified that the second player can win Sim with perfect play, but finding a perfect strategy that humans can easily memorize is an open problem.
A self-improving Java applet including its source code is availableJava applet page for online play against a computer program.
The game of Sim is one example of a Ramsey game. Other Ramsey games are possible. For instance, the players can be allowed to color more than one line during their turns. This game also can be played with the Java applet mentioned above.
Another Ramsey game similar to Sim and related to Ramsey number R(4,4)=18, which again cannot end in a tie, is played on 18 vertices and the 153 edges between them. The two players must avoid to color a monochromatic tetrahedron (a three-dimensional pyramid with four triangular faces).
The Ramsey number R(3,3,3)=17 implies that any three-coloring of the complete graph on 17 vertices must contain a monochromatic triangle. A corresponding Ramsey game uses pencils of three colors. One approach can have three players compete, while another would allow two players to alternately select any of the three colors to paint an edge of the graph, until a player loses by completing a monochromatic triangle. Finding perfect winning strategies for these variants is most likely out of reach.
A technical reportGraph Ramsey Games by Wolfgang Slany at arXiv by Wolfgang Slany is available online, with many references to literature on Sim, going back to the game's introduction by Gustavus Simmons in 1969,Simmons, Gustavus J. "The game of SIM," J. Recreational Mathematics, 2(2), 1969, pp. 66. including proofs and estimates of the difficulty as well as computational complexity of Sim and other Ramsey games.

Carbonation or fizz is the process of dissolving carbon dioxide in a liquid. The process usually involves carbon dioxide under high pressure. When the pressure is reduced, the carbon dioxide is released from the solution as small bubbles, which causes the solution to become effervescent, or fizzy. An example of carbonation is the dissolving of carbon dioxide in water, resulting in carbonated water.

[[Council]]

CATEGORIES: Political organizations, Legislatures

A council is a group of people who come together to consult, deliberate, or make decisions. A council may function as a legislature, especially at a town, city or county level, but most legislative bodies at the state or national level are not considered councils. At such levels, there may be no separate executive branch, and the council may effectively represent the entire government. A board of directors might also be denoted as a council. A committee might also be denoted as a council, though a committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body, while a council may not be. Because many schools have a student council, the council is the form of governance with which many people are likely to have their first experience as electors or participants.
A member of a council may be referred to as a councillor, or by the gender-specific titles of councilman and councilwoman.

The Boxer is a breed of stocky, medium-sized, short-haired dogs developed in Germany. Their coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, which may cover the entire body, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, and is part of the Molosser group.
Boxers were first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich in 1895, the first Boxer club being founded the next year. Based on 2012 American Kennel Club statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh most popular breed of dog in the United States for the third consecutive year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title=Registration Statistics |author= American Kennel Club[/tpl]

[[Council house]]
CATEGORIES: House types, Public housing in the United Kingdom, Housing estates in London

A council house, otherwise known as a local authority house, normally part of a council estate, is a form of public or social housing. The term is used primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Council houses were built and operated by local councils to supply uncrowded, well-built homes on secure tenancies at reasonable rents to primarily working-class people. Council house development began in the late 19th century and peaked in the mid-20th century, at which time council housing included many large suburban "council estates"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.academia.edu/1593132/Suburban_Ideals_on_Englands_Interwar_Council_Estates |title=Suburban Ideals on England's Interwar Council Estates |first=Matthew |last=Hollow |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-12-29[/tpl] and numerous urban developments featuring tower blocks. Many of these developments did not live up to the hopes of their supporters, and now suffer from urban blight.
Since 1979, the role of council housing has been reduced by the introduction of Right to Buy legislation, and a change of emphasis to the development of new social housing by housing associations. Nonetheless, a substantial part of the UK population still lives in council housing.  In 2010 about 17% of UK households lived in social housing.  Approximately 55% of the country’s social housing stock is owned by local authorities (of which 15% is managed on a day-to-day basis by arms-length management organisations, rather than the authority), and 45% by housing associations.[tpl]citation|last=Cowan|first=David|year=2009|title=Trust, Distrust and Betrayal|journal=MLR|volume=72|issue=2|pages=157–181|issn=|doi=[/tpl] In Scotland, council estates are known as schemes.

In the United Kingdom, housing associations are private, non-profit making organisations that provide low-cost "social housing" for people in need of a home. Any trading surplus is used to maintain existing housing and to help finance new homes.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Although independent they are regulated by the state and commonly receive public funding. They are now the United Kingdom's major providers of new housing for rent, while many also run shared ownership schemes to help those who cannot afford to buy a home outright.
Housing associations provide a wide range of housing, some managing large estates of housing for families, while the smallest may perhaps manage a single scheme of housing for older people. Much of the supported accommodation in the UK is also provided by housing associations, with specialist projects for people with mental health or learning disabilities, with substance misuse problems (alcohol or illegal drugs), the formerly homeless, young people, ex-offenders and women fleeing domestic violence. In Australia, the term housing association refers to larger, growth oriented 'not-for'dividend' community housing providers. Smaller community housing providers may include trusts, cooperatives etc.  State and Territory owned public housing represents about 80% of social housing in Australia.  Over the years these public housing entities have had different names including 'housing commissions' 'housing trusts' etc.

[[Collective bargaining]]
CATEGORIES: Austerity, Labor, Labour relations, Labor rights, Industrial agreements

Collective bargaining is a process of negotiations between employers and a group of employees aimed at reaching agreements to regulate working conditions. The interests of the employees are commonly presented by representatives of a trade union to which the employees belong. The collective agreements reached by these negotiations usually set out wage scales, working hours, training, health and safety, overtime, grievance mechanisms, and rights to participate in workplace or company affairs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl]
The union may negotiate with a single employer (who is typically representing a company's shareholders) or may negotiate with a group of businesses, depending on the country, to reach an industry wide agreement. A collective agreement functions as a labor contract between an employer and one or contract between an employer and one or more unions. Collective bargaining consists of the process of negotiation between representatives of a union and employers (generally represented by management, in some countries such as Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands by an employers' organization) in respect of the terms and conditions of employment of employees, such as wages, hours of work, working conditions, grievance-procedures, and about the rights and responsibilities of trade unions. The parties often refer to the result of the negotiation as a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) or as a collective employment agreement (CEA).

Mutual Gains Bargaining (MGB) is an approach to collective bargaining intended to reach win-win outcomes for the negotiating parties.
Instead of the traditional adversarial (i.e., "win/lose") approach (also known as "positional bargaining"), the mutual gains approach is quite similar to Principled Negotiation (first described by Roger Fisher in his book Getting to YES), where the goal is to reach a sustainable (i.e., lasting) agreement that both parties (or all parties in a multi-party negotiation) can live with and support.
Mutual gains bargaining has been used successfully in such areas as labor-management relations and environmental negotiations.

It was made possible by the success of Operation Fall Gelb in the Battle of France (the invasion of Belgium). Before that invasion, it had not yet been decided whether mainland France would be attacked: this would depend on the outcome of Fall Gelb.
Fall Rot consisted of two suboperations: first a preliminary attack was carried out in the west over the river Somme in the direction of the Seine; the main offensive started on 9 June in the center over the river Aisne.

During his reign, the renaissance of letters, begun by his predecessor Basil I, continued; but the Empire also saw several military defeats in the Balkans against Bulgaria and against the Arabs in Sicily and the Aegean.

Alexander ([tpl]lang-el|Αλέξανδρος[/tpl], Alexandros, 870 [tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] June 6, 913), sometimes numbered Alexander III,Enumerated after Alexander Severus, and the usurper Domitius Alexander. ruled as Emperor of the Byzantine Empire in 912–913. He was the third son of Emperor Basil I and Eudokia Ingerina. Unlike his older brother Leo VI the Wise, his paternity was not disputed between Basil I and Michael III because he was born years after the death of Michael.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | last = Schmitz | first = Leonhard | authorlink = | title = Alexander | editor = William Smith | encyclopedia = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology | volume = 1 | pages = 115 | publisher = Little, Brown and Company | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=130[/tpl]

[[Almost]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical terminology, Set theory

In set theory, when dealing with sets of infinite size, the term almost or nearly is used to mean all the elements except for finitely many.
In other words, an infinite set S that is a subset of another infinite set L, is almost L if the subtracted set L\S is of finite size.
Examples:
This is conceptually similar to the almost everywhere concept of measure theory, but is not the same.  For example, the Cantor set is uncountably infinite, but has Lebesgue measure zero.  So a real number in (0, 1) is a member of the complement of the Cantor set almost everywhere, but it is not true that the complement of the Cantor set is almost the real numbers in (0, 1).

The Locomobile Company of America was an automobile manufacturer founded in 1899. For the first two years it was located in Watertown, Massachusetts, but production was transferred to Bridgeport, Connecticut, during 1900, where it remained until the company's demise in 1929. The company manufactured affordable, small steam cars until 1903, then production switched entirely to internal combustion-powered luxury automobiles. Locomobile was taken over in 1922 by Durant Motors and went out of business in 1929. The cars were always sold under the brand name Locomobile.

[[Well-defined]]

CATEGORIES: Definition, Mathematical terminology

In mathematics, an expression is well-defined if it is unambiguous and its objects are independent of their representation. More simply, it means that a mathematical statement is sensible and definite. In particular, a function is well-defined if it gives the same result when the form (the way in which it is presented) but not the value of an input is changed. The term well-defined is also used to indicate whether a logical statement is unambiguous, and a solution to a partial differential equation is said to be well-defined if it is continuous on the boundary.

Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos or Porphyrogenitus, "the Purple-born" (that is, born in the imperial bed chambers) ([tpl]lang-el|Κωνσταντῖνος Ζ΄ Πορφυρογέννητος, Kōnstantinos VII Porphyrogennētos[/tpl]; September 2, 905 – November 9, 959), was the fourth Emperor of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, reigning from 913 to 959. He was the son of the emperor Leo VI and his fourth wife, Zoe Karbonopsina, and the nephew of his predecessor, the emperor Alexander.
Most of his reign was dominated by co-regents: from 913 until 919 he was under the regency of his mother, while from 920 until 945 he shared the throne with Romanos Lekapenos, whose daughter Helena he married, and his sons. Constantine VII is best known for his four books, De Administrando Imperio (bearing in Greek the heading Πρὸς τὸν ἴδιον υἱόν Ῥωμανόν), De Ceremoniis (Περὶ τῆς Βασιλείου Τάξεως), De Thematibus (Περὶ θεμάτων Άνατολῆς καὶ Δύσεως), and Vita Basilii (Βίος Βασιλείου).
His nickname alludes to the Purple Room of the Imperial palace, decorated with porphyry, where legitimate children of reigning emperors were normally born. Constantine was also born in this room, although his mother Zoe had not been married to Leo at that time. Nevertheless, the epithet allowed him to underline his position as the legitimized son, as opposed to all others who claimed the throne during his lifetime. Sons born to a reigning Emperor held precedence in the Eastern Roman line of succession over elder sons not born "in the purple".

[[TV and FM DX]]
CATEGORIES: Radio frequency propagation, Radio hobbies

TV DX and FM DX is  the active search for distant radio or television stations received during unusual atmospheric conditions. The term DX is an old telegraphic term meaning "long distance."
VHF/UHF television and radio signals are normally limited to a maximum "deep fringe" reception service area of approximately [tpl]convert|40|-|100|mi|km|lk=on[/tpl] in areas where the broadcast spectrum is congested, and about 50 percent farther in the absence of interference. However, providing favourable atmospheric conditions are present, television and radio signals sometimes can be received hundreds or even thousands of miles outside their intended coverage area. These signals are often received using a large outdoor antenna system connected to a sensitive TV or FM receiver, although this may not always be the case. Many times smaller antennas and receivers such as those in vehicles will receive stations farther than normal depending on how favourable conditions are.
While only a limited number of local stations can normally be received at satisfactory signal strengths in any given area, tuning into other channels may reveal weaker signals from adjacent areas. More consistently strong signals, especially those accentuated by unusual atmospheric conditions, can be achieved by improving the antenna system. The development of interest in TV-FM DX as a hobby can arise after more distant signals are either intentionally or accidentally discovered, leading to a serious interest in improving the listener's antenna and receiving installation for the purpose of actively seeking long-range television and radio reception. The TV-FM DX hobby is somewhat similar to other radio/electronic related hobbies such as amateur radio, Medium Wave DX, or short-wave radio, and organisations such as the Worldwide TV-FM DX Association have developed to coordinate and foster the further study and enjoyment of VHF/UHF television and FM broadcast DX.Official WTFDA Club Website

[[Factor analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Factor analysis, Psychometrics, Multivariate statistics, Latent variable models, Market research, Product management, Marketing, Educational psychology

Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. For example, it is possible that variations in four observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus "error" terms. The information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Computationally this technique is equivalent to low rank approximation of the matrix of observed variables. Factor analysis originated in psychometrics, and is used in behavioral sciences, social sciences, marketing, product management, operations research, and other applied sciences that deal with large quantities of data.
Factor analysis is related to principal component analysis (PCA), but the two are not identical.  Latent variable models,  including factor analysis, use regression modelling techniques to test hypotheses producing error terms, while PCA is a descriptive statistical technique.[tpl]cite book |last1=Bartholomew |first1=D.J. |last2=Steele |first2=F. |last3=Galbraith |first3=J. |last4=Moustaki |first4=I. |title=Analysis of Multivariate Social Science Data |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2008 |isbn=1584889608 |edition=2nd |series=Statistics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Series[/tpl] There has been significant controversy in the field over the equivalence or otherwise of the two techniques (see exploratory factor analysis versus principal components analysis).[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

Cabiria is a 1914 Italian silent film, directed by  Giovanni Pastrone (1883–1959) and shot in Turin. The film is set in ancient Sicily,  Carthage, and Cirta during the period of the Second Punic War (218–202 BC). It follows a melodramatic main plot about an abducted little girl, Cabiria, and features an eruption of Mt. Etna, heinous religious rituals in Carthage, the alpine trek of Hannibal, Archimedes' defeat of the Roman fleet at the Siege of Syracuse and Scipio maneuvering in North Africa.  Apart from being a classic on its own terms, the film is also notable for being the first film in which the long-running film character Maciste makes his debut. According to Martin Scorsese,[tpl]cite web |author=Ebert, Roger |date=July 2, 2006 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060702/REVIEWS08/607020301/1023 |title=Cabiria (1914) |publisher=rogerebert.suntimes.com[/tpl] in this work Pastrone invented the epic movie and deserves credit for many of the innovations often attributed to D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. Among those were the first use of the moving camera, thus freeing the narrative film from "static gaze".
The historical background and characters in the story are taken from Livy's Ab Urbe Condita (written ca. 27–25 BC). In addition, the script of Cabiria was partially based on Gustave Flaubert's 1862 novel Salammbo and Emilio Salgari's 1908 novel Cartagine in fiamme (Carthage in Flames).

The REO Speed Wagon (alternatively Reo Speedwagon) was a light motor truck manufactured by REO Motor Car Company. It was an ancestor of the pickup truck.
First introduced in 1915, production continued through at least 1953In 1936 REO abandoned the manufacture of automobiles to concentrate on trucks. and led to REO being one of the better known manufacturers of commercial vehicles prior to World War II. Although the basic design and styling of the chassis remained consistent, the Speed Wagon was manufactured in a variety of configurations (pickup and panel truck, passenger bus) to serve as delivery, tow, dump, and fire trucks as well as hearses and ambulances.

While REO produced some wagons based on its automobile chassis (the Model H) starting in 1908 and had organized a division to produce trucks in 1910 with success, the Speed Wagon's introduction in 1915 was a significant step and a sales success. The company was soon offering a variety of Speed Wagon models with many options and by 1925 had produced 125,000.[tpl]cite journal|last=Senefsky|first=Bill|title=REO Speedwagon - The World's First Pickup|journal=Diesel Power|date=May 2009|url=http://www.dieselpowermag.com/features/0905dp_reo_speedwagon/index.html[/tpl]
After years of roughly equal car and truck emphasis, REO shifted its focus completely to trucks, ending automobile production in 1936. Production for the civilian market was suspended during World War II, resuming in 1946.
The rock and roll band REO Speedwagon took its name from this vehicle, but pronouncing the name with each individual letter instead of as a single word. Founding band member Neal Doughty recalls seeing the name written on the board in his History of Transportation class at the University of Illinois and later suggesting it to his bandmates.[tpl]cite web|title=Review of LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME…|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/5012/|publisher=Film Threat|accessdate=23 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|first1=Allen | last1=Verbrugge | first2= Jody | last2= Sowell|title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Please Welcome…|year=2002[/tpl]

[[Horizon effect]]

CATEGORIES: Game artificial intelligence

The horizon effect is a problem in artificial intelligence where, in many games, the number of possible states or positions is immense and computers can only feasibly search a small portion of it, typically a few plies down the game tree. Thus, for a computer searching only five plies, there is a possibility that it will make a move which is detrimental, but the detrimental effect is not visible because it does not search to the depth of the error (i.e. beyond its horizon).
When evaluating a large game tree using techniques such as minimax or alpha-beta pruning, search depth is limited for feasibility reasons. However, evaluating a partial tree may give a misleading result.  When a significant change exists just over the 'horizon' of the search depth, the computational device falls victim to the horizon effect.
The horizon effect can be mitigated by extending the search algorithm with a quiescence search. This gives the search algorithm ability to look beyond its horizon for a certain class of moves of major importance to the game state, such as captures. 
Rewriting the evaluation function for leaf nodes and/or analyzing sufficiently more nodes will solve many horizon effect problems.

[[Fear and Trembling]]

CATEGORIES: 1843 books, Books by Søren Kierkegaard, Ethics books

Fear and Trembling (original Danish title: Frygt og Bæven) is an influential philosophical work by Søren Kierkegaard, published in 1843 under the pseudonym Johannes de silentio (John of the Silence).  The title is a reference to a line from Philippians 2:12, "...continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling." - itself a probable reference to Psalms 55:6, "Fear and trembling came upon me..." (the Greek is identical).
Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety"Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate. ... Anxiety is freedom's possibility, and only such anxiety is through faith absolutely educative, because it consumes all finite ends and discovers all their deceptiveness. And no Grand Inquisitor has such dreadful torments in readiness as anxiety has, and no secret agent knows as cunningly as anxiety to attack his suspect in his weakest moment or to make alluring the trap in which he will be caught, and no discerning judge understands how to interrogate and examine the accused as does anxiety, which never lets the accused escape, neither through amusement, nor by noise, nor during work, neither by day nor by night." - Vigilius Haufniensis (Pseudonym), The Concept of Anxiety by Søren Kierkegaard p. 155-156, Reidar Thomte, 1980 that must have been present in Abraham when "God tested him and said to him, take Isaac, your only son, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him as a burnt offering on the mountain that I shall show you."Gen 22: 1-2 The Bible
Abraham had a choice to complete the task or to forget it. He resigned himself to the three and a half day journey and to the loss of his son. "He said nothing to Sarah, nothing to Eliezer. Who, after all, could understand him, for did not the nature of temptation extract from him a pledge of silence? He split the firewood, he bound Isaac, he lit the fire, he drew the knife."Fear and Trembling p. 22 Because he kept everything to himself in hiddenness he "isolated himself as higher than the universal." Kierkegaard envisions two types of people in Fear and Trembling and Repetition. One lives in hope, Abraham, the other lives in memory, The Young Man and Constantin Constantius. He discussed them beforehand in Lectures delivered before the Symparanekromenoni and The Unhappiest Man.See Either/Or Part I p. 163-228 Swenson and compare with Repetition p. 131-133, Nichol One hopes for happiness from something "out there" while the other finds happiness from something in himself.  This he brought out in his upbuilding discourse, published on the same date.

Insofar as the object viewed belongs to the external world, then how the observer is constituted is probably less important, or, more correctly then what is necessary for the observation is something irrelevant to his deeper nature. But the more the object of observation belongs to the world of the spirit, the more important is the way he himself is constituted in his innermost nature, because everything spiritual is appropriated only in freedom; but what is appropriated in freedom is also brought forth. The difference, then, is not the external but the internal, and everything that makes a person impure and his observation impure comes from within. Søren Kierkegaard, Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843, Hong p. 59-60[/tpl]
Kierkegaard says, "Infinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith, for only in infinite resignation does an individual become conscious of his eternal validity, and only then can one speak of grasping existence by virtue of faith."Fear and Trembling p. 46 He spoke about this kind of consciousness in an earlier book. "There comes a moment in a person's life when immediacy is ripe, so to speak, and when the spirit requires a higher form, when it wants to lay hold of itself as spirit. As immediate spirit, a person is bound up with all the earthly life, and now spirit wants to gather itself together out of this dispersion, so to speak, and to transfigure itself in itself; the personality wants to become conscious in its eternal validity. If this does not happen, if the movement is halted, if it is repressed, then depression sets in." Either/Or II p. 188-189 Once Abraham became conscious of his eternal validity he arrived at the door of faith and acted according to his faith. In this action he became a knight of faith.Fear and Trembling p. 75-77 In other words, one must give up all his or her earthly possessions in infinite resignation and must also be willing to give up whatever it is that he or she loves more than God.Kierkegaard wrote about resignation in 1835. "I have tasted the fruits of the tree of knowledge and time and again have delighted in their savoriness. But this joy was only in the moment of cognition and did not leave a deeper mark on me. It seems to me that I have not drunk from the cup of wisdom but have fallen into it. I have sought to find the principle for my life through resignation Resignation, by supposing that since everything proceeds according to inscrutable laws it could not be otherwise, by blunting my ambitions and the antennae of my vanity. Because I could not get everything to suit me, I abdicated with a consciousness of my own competence, somewhat the way decrepit clergymen resign with pension. What did I find? Not my self Jeg, which is what I did seek to find in that way (I imagined my soul, if I may say so, as shut up in a box with a spring lock, which external surroundings would release by pressing the spring). — Consequently the seeking and finding of the Kingdom of Heaven was the first thing to be resolved. But it is just as useless for a man to want first of all to decide the externals and after that the fundamentals as it is for a cosmic body, thinking to form itself, first of all to decide the nature of its surface, to what bodies it should turn its light, to which its dark side, without first letting the harmony of centrifugal and centripetal forces realize realisere its existence Existents and letting the rest come of itself." Journals & Papers of Søren Kierkegaard, 1A Gilleleie, August 1, 1835 http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_A.html
Kierkegaard used the ethical system of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and the aesthetic stories of Agnes and the merman,Fear and Trembling p. 94-98 The Deceived Merman (From The Old Danish) http://poetry.poetryx.com/poems/15409/ Kierkegaard discussed this story in his Journals. "I have thought of adapting legend of Agnes and the Merman from an angle that has not occurred to any poet. The Merman is a seducer, but when he has won Agnes' love he is so moved by it that he wants to belong to her entirely. — But this, you see, he cannot do, since he must initiate her into his whole tragic existence, that he is a monster at certain times, etc., that the Church cannot give its blessing to them. He despairs and in his despair plunges to the bottom of the sea and remains there, but Agnes imagines that he only wanted to deceive her. But this is poetry, not that wretched, miserable trash in which everything revolves around ridiculousness and nonsense. Such a complication can be resolved only by the religious (which has its name because it resolves all witchcraft); if the Merman could believe, his faith perhaps could transform him into a human being." Journals IVA 113 His point seems to be that God wants to work with human beings, not fantastic imaginary creatures. Faith transforms us from an imaginary being into a human being.

Several authorities consider the work autobiographical. It can be explained as Kierkegaard's way of working himself through the loss of his fiancee, Regine Olsen. Abraham becomes Kierkegaard and Isaac becomes Regine in this interpretation.

[[Progressive chess]]

CATEGORIES: Chess variants

Progressive chess is a chess variant in which players, rather than just making one move per turn, play progressively longer series of moves. The game starts with White making one move, then Black makes two consecutive moves, White replies with three, Black makes four and so on. Progressive chess can be combined with other variants; for example, when circe is played as a game, it is usually progressively. Progressive chess is considered particularly apt for playing correspondence chess using mail or some other slow medium, because of the relatively small number of moves in a typical game.

[[Implied volatility]]

CATEGORIES: Derivatives (finance), Mathematical finance

In financial mathematics, the implied volatility of an option contract is that value of the volatility of the  underlying instrument which, when input in an option pricing model (such as Black–Scholes) will return a theoretical value equal to the current market price of the option.  A non-option financial instrument that has embedded optionality, such as an interest rate cap, can also have an implied volatility.  Implied volatility, a forward-looking and subjective measure, differs from historical volatility because the latter is calculated from known past returns of a security.

Majdanek or KL Lublin was a Nazi concentration and extermination camp established on the outskirts of the city of Lublin during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. Although initially purposed for forced labor rather than extermination, the camp was used to kill people on an industrial scale during Operation Reinhard, the German plan to murder all Jews within their General Government territory of Poland. The camp, which operated from October 1, 1941 until July 22, 1944, was captured nearly intact, because the advance of the Soviet Red Army prevented the SS from destroying most of its infrastructure; but also, due to the ineptitude of commandant Anton Thernes who failed in his task of removing incriminating evidence of war crimes. Majdanek, also known to the SS as Konzentrationslager Lublin, remains the best preserved Nazi concentration camp of the Holocaust.http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=136
Unlike other similar camps in Poland, Majdanek was not located in a remote rural location away from population centres, but within the boundaries of a major city (see also: Nisko Plan preceding the formation of the Ghetto).[tpl]citation|last=Rosenberg|first=Jennifer|chapter=Majdanek: An Overview|title=20th Century History|year=2008|publisher=about.com|url=http://history1900s.about.com/library/holocaust/aa092099.htm[/tpl]. This proximity led the camp to be named 'Majdanek' ("little Majdan") by local people in 1941 because it was adjacent to the city's district of Majdan Tatarski ("Tatar Maidan") in Lublin. The Nazi documents initially called the site "Prisoner of War Camp of the Waffen-SS in Lublin" because of the way it was operated and funded. It was renamed by RSHA in Berlin as Konzentrationslager on April 9, 1943; however, the local Polish name is how it is remembered.[tpl]cite web |url=http://michal.nintendos.pl/obozy/majdanek/zalozenia%20i%20budowa%20(m).html |title=Założenia i budowa (Purpose and construction, selection of photographs) |publisher=KL Lublin |work=Majdanek concentration camp |accessdate=2013-04-18 |quote=Concentration camp name change 9.04.1943.[/tpl]

[[Moneyness]]

CATEGORIES: Options (finance), Derivatives (finance)

In finance, moneyness is the relative position of the current price (or future price) of an underlying asset (e.g., a stock) with respect to the strike price of a derivative, most commonly a call option or a put option. Moneyness is firstly a three-fold classification: if the derivative would make money if it were to expire today, it is said to be in the money, while if it would not make money it is said to be out of the money, and if the current price and strike price are equal, it is said to be at the money. There are two slightly different definitions, according to whether one uses the current price (spot) or future price (forward), specified as "at the money spot" or "at the money forward", etc.
This rough classification can be quantified by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number, measuring how far the asset is in the money or out of the money with respect to the strike – or conversely how far a strike is in or out of the money with respect to the spot (or forward) price of the asset. This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the relative volatility surface: the implied volatility in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price. The most basic of these measures is simple moneyness, which is the ratio of spot (or forward) to strike, or the reciprocal, depending on convention. A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure. It can be measured in percentage probability of expiring in the money, which is the forward value of a binary call option with the given strike,
and is equal to the auxiliary N(d2) term in the Black–Scholes formula. This can also be measured in standard deviations, measuring how far above or below the strike price the current price is, in terms of volatility; this quantity is given by d2. Another closely related measure of moneyness is the Delta of a call or put option, which is often used by traders but actually equals N(d1), not N(d2), and there are others, with convention depending on market.

CATEGORIES: Unix, System administration, Lifetime achievement awards

The USENIX Association is the Advanced Computing Systems Association. It was founded in 1975 under the name "Unix Users Group," focusing primarily on the study and development of Unix and similar systems. In June 1977, a lawyer from AT&T Corporation informed the group that they could not use the word UNIX as it was a trademark of Western Electric (the manufacturing arm of AT&T until 1995), which led to the change of name to USENIX. It has since grown into a respected organization among practitioners, developers, and researchers of computer operating systems more generally. Since its founding, it has published a technical journal entitled ;login:.;login: The USENIX Magazine
USENIX was started as a technical organization. As commercial interest grew, a number of separate groups started in parallel, most notably STUG, the Software Tools Users Group, a technical adjunct for Unix-like tools and interface on non-Unix operating systems, and /usr/group, a commercially oriented user group.
USENIX has a special interest group for system administrators, LISA, formerly SAGE.
It sponsors several conferences and workshops each year, most notably the USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI), the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI), the USENIX Annual Technical Conference, the USENIX Security Symposium, the USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST), and with LISA (formerly SAGE), the Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA).

[[History of Lobos]]

CATEGORIES: Lobos, History of Argentina by city

This article is about the history of Lobos, a city in the [tpl]province|Buenos Aires|Argentina[/tpl].
In 1740 a Jesuit mission led by Reverend Father Kalkner surveyed the centre and south of the province of Buenos Aires and thus picked up some geographic information on the area.  In 1772, thanks to Falkner's notes a map of the region was printed in London. The map contained the inscription Laguna de Lobos ("Lagoon of Wolves" in Spanish) below the drawing of the lagoon.
It is said that the name Lobos stems from the number of otters that at that time populated the lagoon and were known as lobos de agua ("water wolves") or lobos de río ("river wolves"); however, there are historians who believe Lobos had been given this name due to the wild dogs staying around and because they bore a resemblance to wolves.
By 1779 several guards settled down in the area and several forts, fortresses and military positions were built to form a defensive wall against the natives. These positions were set up by the order of Viceroy Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo and were named Chascomús, Ranchos, Monte, Lobos, Navarro, Areco and Rojas.
On August 21, 1779 Gunnery Sergeant Pedro Rodríguez concluded the construction of the main parts of the fort San Pedro de Los Lobos, over the eastern bank of the Lagoon about 300 meters from its shoreline and nearly 1,500 meters east of the mouth of Las Garzas stream, finishing the work Lieutenant Bernardo Serrano had begun.
By late 1800 José Salgado and his wife Pascuala Rivas de Salgado were granted an area to colonize as a donation made by Viceroy Vértiz.  They founded Pago de Los Lobos on June 2, 1802.
Their Christian faith inspired them to build a straw-and-mud oratory, with the prompting of Nuestra Señora del Carmen; the Chapel was finished in June 1803.  José García Miranda was the first priest doctor. The chapel became the urban core of Lobos.
The current church was opened in 1906 by Monsignor Terreno, bishop of La Plata and was completed in 1912.  In the church lies the remains of the founder José Salgado, Colonel Domingo S. Arévalo, soldier of the Independence and parish priests Enrique Ferroni, José Albertini and Emilio Larumbe.
The church measures 49 × 19 m and has a capacity of 2,000 people. The tower is 37 meters tall. The main altar is made up of Carrara marble.

[[Jizi]]

CATEGORIES: Early Korean history, Gojoseon rulers, History of Ancient China, Legendary rulers

Jizi (Chinese:箕子, Gija in Korean)The character "zi" in "Jizi" does not mean a rank of nobility. It was Shang dynasty tradition that royal family members were called by the combination of the place at which they were enfeoffed and the suffix "zi." ([tpl]harvnb|Chen|2003[/tpl], pp. 92–93.) was a semi-legendary Chinese sage who is said to have ruled Gojoseon in the 11th century BCE. Early Chinese documents like the Book of Documents and the Bamboo Annals described him as a virtuous relative of the last king of the Shang dynasty who was punished for remonstrating with the king. After Shang was overthrown by Zhou in the 1040s BCE, he allegedly gave political advice to King Wu, the first Zhou king. Chinese texts from the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) onwards claimed that King Wu enfeoffed Jizi as ruler of Chaoxian (朝鮮, pronounced "Joseon" in Korean). According to the Book of Han (1st century CE), Jizi brought agriculture, sericulture, and many other facets of Chinese civilization to Joseon.
Gija (the Korean pronunciation of "Jizi") may have been the object of a state cult in sixth-century Goguryeo, and a mausoleum to him was established in Goryeo in 1102, but the first extant Korean text to mention Gija was the Samguk Sagi (1145). Starting in the late thirteenth century, Gija was fully integrated into Korean history, being described as a successor to the descendants of Dangun in the state of Old Joseon. Following the spread of Neo-Confucianism in Korea in the fourteenth century, scholars of the Joseon Dynasty (est. 1392) promoted Gija as a culture hero who had raised Korean civilization to the same level as China, and Gija became an integral part of Korean cultural identity.
Following the rise of Korean nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, however, Korean intellectuals lost their pride in association with Gija and started to doubt the traditional account of his enfeoffment as ruler of Gojoseon. Shin Chaeho (1880–1936) questioned the extent of Gija's cultural contributions, in part because Gija, a Chinese, did not fit into Shin's view of Korean history as the history of the Korean minjok, or "race-nation." Postwar Korean scholars in both North and South Korea have also strongly criticized the story of Gija's migration to Korea in the eleventh century BCE.
His family name was Zi/Ja (子) and given name was Xuyu/Suyu (胥餘/서여 xūyú/seoyeo, or 須臾/수유 xūyú/suyu).[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

COBUILD, an acronym for "Collins Birmingham University International Language Database," is a British research facility set up at the University of Birmingham in 1980 and funded by Collins publishers.
The facility was led by Professor John Sinclair. The most important achievement of the COBUILD project has been the creation and analysis of a corpus of contemporary text (the Bank of English), and the production of the monolingual learner's dictionary Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary (1987, 2nd edition 1995, 3rd edition 2001, 4th edition 2003, 5th edition 2006), based on the study of the COBUILD corpus.
A number of other dictionaries and grammars have also been published, all based exclusively on evidence from the Bank of English.

CATEGORIES: 1898 births, 1978 deaths, British lexicographers, Grammarians of English, Alumni of University College London

Albert Sidney (or SydneyA. P. Cowie, ‘Hornby, Albert Sydney (1898–1978)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004) Hornby, usually just A. S. Hornby (1898–1978), was an English grammarian, lexicographer, and pioneer in the field of English language learning and teaching (ELT).
Hornby was born in Chester and educated at University College London. In April 1924 he went to Japan to teach English at Oita University(Oita Higher Commercial School at the time) . He joined Harold E. Palmer in his programme of vocabulary research at the Institute for Research in English Teaching (IRET). Palmer invited him to Tokyo in April 1933 as an assistant; in 1936, Horner became the technical adviser and editor of IRET's Bulletin.
He began work the following year with E. V. Gatenby and H. Wakefield on a new type of dictionary that was aimed at foreign learners, of English, the first monolingual learners' dictionary. It was completed in 1940 and published by Kaitakusha two years later in Tokyo as The Idiomatic and Syntactic English Dictionary. After leaving Japan in 1942, Hornby joined the British Council and later became the first editor of the journal English Language Teaching, launched in October 1946.
In 1948 his dictionary was reissued by Oxford University Press as A Learner's Dictionary of Current English. The subsequent editions of the dictionary were and continue to be a great commercial success in ELT publishing. It is now in its eighth edition and is known as the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary.
The A.S. Hornby Educational Trust was established in 1961. The Trust supports ELT practitioners from developing countries and countries in transition.

[[Varieties of Chinese]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese dialects, Language versus dialect

Chinese (hànyǔ  汉语/漢語 or zhōngguóhuà 中国话/中國話) comprises many regional language varieties sometimes grouped together as the Chinese dialects, the primary ones being Mandarin, Wu, Yue, and Min. These are not mutually intelligible, and even many of the regional varieties (especially Min) are themselves composed of a number of non-mutually-intelligible subvarieties. As a result, some linguists typically refer to these varieties as separate languages. Because they share a common written form, most Chinese speakers and Chinese linguists perceive them to be variations of a single Chinese language and refer to them as dialects, translating the Chinese terms huà 话, yǔ 語, and fāngyán 方言. The neologism topolect has been coined as a more literal translation of fangyan in order to avoid the connotations of the term "dialect" (which in its normal English usage suggests mutually intelligible varieties of a single language) and to make a clearer distinction between "major varieties" (separate languages, in Western terminology) and "minor varieties" (dialects of a single language). In this article, however, the generic term "variety" will be used.
Chinese people make a strong distinction between written language (文, Pinyin: wén) and spoken language (语/語 yǔ). English does not necessarily have this distinction. As a result the terms Zhongwen (中文) and Hanyu (汉语/漢語) in Chinese are both translated in English as "Chinese".

The sword-and-sandal, or peplum film (pepla plural) is a genre of largely Italian-made historical or biblical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965, eventually being replaced in 1965 by the Spaghetti Western. The pepla attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as Spartacus, Samson and Delilah and The Ten Commandments.
The terms "peplum" (referring to the togas or robes which the ancient Romans wore) and "sword-and-sandal" were used in a condescending way by film critics. Italian director Vittorio Cottafavi called the genre "Neo-Mythology".p.14 M. Winkler, Martin  Troy: from Homer's Iliad to Hollywood Epic Wiley-Blackwell, 2007

[[Bat Boy (character)]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional characters from West Virginia, Fictional bats

Bat Boy is a creature who made several appearances in the defunct American supermarket tabloid Weekly World News. The Weekly World News published patently fabricated stories which were purported to be factual. Within the pages of the paper, Bat Boy is described as a creature who is 'half human and half bat'. His pursuers, according to Weekly World News, are scientists and United States government officials; he is frequently captured, then later makes a daring escape. The original scientist who found him was named Dr. Bob Dillon.  Matthew Daemon, S.O.S. (Seeker of Obscure Supernaturals) crossed paths with him on several occasions.
Bat Boy was created by former Weekly World News Editor Dick Kulpa. He debuted as a cover story on June 23, 1992. The original front-page photo of Bat Boy, showing his grotesque screaming face, was the second-best selling issue in the tabloid's history, and he has since evolved into a pop-culture icon. He became the tabloid's de facto mascot of sorts. The story of Bat Boy was turned into an Off-Broadway musical, Bat Boy: The Musical.

The Treaty of Peace with Japan (commonly known as the Treaty of San Francisco, Peace Treaty of San Francisco, or San Francisco Peace Treaty), between Japan and part of the Allied Powers, was officially signed by 48 nations on September 8, 1951, at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, United States. It came into force on April 28, 1952.
This treaty served to officially end World War II, to formally end Japan's position as an imperial power, and to allocate compensation to Allied civilians and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes. This treaty made extensive use of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies' goals.
This treaty, along with the Security Treaty signed that same day, is said to mark the beginning of the "San Francisco System"; this term, coined by historian John W. Dower, signifies the effects of Japan's relationship with the United States and its role in the international arena as determined by these two treaties and is used to discuss the ways in which these effects have governed Japan's post-war history.
This treaty also introduced the problem of the legal status of Taiwan due to its lack of specificity as to what country Taiwan was to be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is really still held by the Allies (particularly the US).

[[Parker Morris Committee]]

CATEGORIES: Reports of the United Kingdom government, Public housing in the United Kingdom, 1961 in the United Kingdom

The Parker Morris Committee drew up an influential 1961 report on housing space standards in public housing in the United Kingdom titled Homes for Today and Tomorrow. The report concluded that the quality of social housing needed to be improved to match the rise in living standards and made a number of recommendations. The Committee took a functional approach to determining space standards in the home by considering what furniture was needed in rooms, the space needed to use the furniture and move around it, and the space needed for normal, household activities.
Out of the report came the Parker Morris Standards, set out in the Ministry of Housing's "Design Bulletin 6 – Space in the Home". This provided typical dimensions for the typical items of furniture for which the dwelling designer should allow space, and provided anthropometric data about the space needed to use and move about furniture.
In 1967 these space standards became mandatory for all housing built in new towns, extended to all council housing in 1969, although they had by then already been adopted by many local councils. The mandatory nature of the standards was ended by the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, as concerns grew over the cost of housing and, generally, public spending.
Among the standards are that:
In the private sector the Parker Morris Standards influenced the 1967 and subsequent standards set by the National House Builders' Registration Council, now the National House Building Council, but were not adopted as written. However it is widely felt that most public and private sector housing being built today fails to meet the Parker Morris standards for floor and storage space, and this led to a decision in 2008 by the former government agency English Partnerships to re-introduce minimum standards that are 10% more generous than those of Parker Morris for developments on its own land.[tpl]Cite journal| last=Hurst | first=Will | title=Agency brings back space standards | date=2 November 2007 | journal=Building Design Magazine | url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=426&storycode=3098967&c=1 | accessdate=23 March 2008[/tpl]
Subsequently, The Office of the Mayor of London has also opted to move to adopt a Design Guide for Housing within the city, which will be 10% more generous than the Parker Morris Standards. This guide was published on 19 August 2010 and will be implemented from April 2011.[tpl]cite web| title=London Housing Design Guide | date=19 August 2010 | publisher=Greater London Authority |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/who-runs-london/mayor/publications/housing/london-housing-design-guide | accessdate=2 September 2010[/tpl]

[[Conjoint analysis (marketing)]]

CATEGORIES: Consumer behaviour, Market research, Product management

Conjoint analysis is a statistical technique used in market research to determine how people value different features that make up an individual product or service.
The objective of conjoint analysis is to determine what combination of a limited number of attributes is most influential on respondent choice or decision making. A controlled set of potential products or services is shown to respondents and by analyzing how they make preferences between these products, the implicit valuation of the individual elements making up the product or service can be determined. These implicit valuations (utilities or part-worths) can be used to create market models that estimate market share, revenue and even profitability of new designs.
Conjoint originated in mathematical psychology and was developed by marketing professor Paul Green at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Data Chan. Other prominent conjoint analysis pioneers include professor V. “Seenu” Srinivasan of Stanford University who developed a linear programming (LINMAP) procedure for rank ordered data as well as a self-explicated approach, Richard Johnson (founder of Sawtooth Software) who developed the Adaptive Conjoint Analysis technique in the 1980s and Jordan Louviere (University of Iowa) who invented and developed Choice-based approaches to conjoint analysis and related techniques such as MaxDiff.
Today it is used in many of the social sciences and applied sciences including marketing, product management, and operations research. It is used frequently in testing customer acceptance of new product designs, in assessing the appeal of advertisements and in service design. It has been used in product positioning, but there are some who raise problems with this application of conjoint analysis (see disadvantages).
Conjoint analysis techniques may also be referred to as multiattribute compositional modelling, discrete choice modelling, or stated preference research, and is part of a broader set of trade-off analysis tools used for systematic analysis of decisions. These tools include Brand-Price Trade-Off, Simalto, and mathematical approaches such as AHP,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22185216|title=A comparison of analytic hierarchy process and conjoint analysis methods in assessing treatment alternatives for stroke rehabilitation|author=Ijzerman MJ, van Til JA, Bridges JF.|year=212|accessdate=4 July 2013[/tpl] evolutionary algorithms or Rule Developing Experimentation.

[[Glipizide]]

CATEGORIES: Sulfonylureas, Pyrazines

Glipizide is an oral rapid- and short-acting anti-diabetic drug from the sulfonylurea class. It is classified as a second generation sulfonylurea, which means that it undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Second-generation sulfonylureas are both more potent and have shorter half-lives than the first-generation sulfonylureas. 
Mechanism of action is produced by blocking potassium channels in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. By partially blocking the potassium channels, the cell remains depolarized, increasing the time the cell spends in the calcium release stage, which results in signaling leading to calcium influx. The increase in calcium will initiate more insulin release from each beta cell. Sulfonylureas may also cause the decrease of serum glucagon and potentiate the action of insulin at the extrapancreatic tissues.
Originally available in 1984, it is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Glucotrol in the USA, where Pfizer sells Glucotrol in doses of 5 and 10 milligrams and Glucotrol XL (an extended release form of glipizide) in doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 milligrams. Other companies also market glipizide, most commonly extended release tablets of 5 and 10 milligrams.

Metformin (BAN, USAN and INN, pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɛ|t|ˈ|f|ɔr|m|ɨ|n[/tpl], [tpl]respell|met|FAWR|min[/tpl]; sold as Glucophage) is an oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class.

It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, and has been investigated for other diseases where insulin resistance may be an important factor. Metformin works by suppressing glucose production by the liver.
A preponderance of evidence suggests that metformin may prevent the cardiovascular complications of diabetes. It helps reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and is not associated with weight gain. [tpl]As of|2010[/tpl], metformin is one of only two oral antidiabetics in the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines (the other being glibenclamide).(March 2010) [tpl]PDFlink|WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|433 KB[/tpl], 16th edition, World Health Organization, p. 24. Retrieved December 22, 2010.
Metformin causes few adverse effects when prescribed appropriately (the most common is gastrointestinal upset) and has been associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactate in the blood) can be a serious concern in overdose and when it is prescribed to people with contraindications, but otherwise, there is no significant risk.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lipska KJ, Bailey CJ, Inzucchi SE | title = Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1431–7 |date=June 2011  | pmid = 21617112 | pmc = 3114336 | doi = 10.2337/dc10-2361 [/tpl]
First synthesized and found to reduce blood sugar in the 1920s, metformin was forgotten for the next two decades as research shifted to insulin and other antidiabetic drugs. Interest in metformin was rekindled in the late 1940s after several reports that it could reduce blood sugar levels in people, and in 1957, French physician Jean Sterne published the first clinical trial of metformin as a treatment for diabetes. It was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1958, Canada in 1972, and the United States in 1995. Metformin is now believed to be the most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug in the world; in the United States alone, more than 48 million prescriptions were filled in 2010 for its generic formulations.[tpl]PDFlink|"The Use of Medicines in the United States: Review of 2010"|1.79 MB[/tpl].

[[Anti-diabetic medication]]

CATEGORIES: Anti-diabetic drugs

Drugs used in diabetes treat diabetes mellitus by lowering glucose levels in the blood. With the exceptions of insulin, exenatide, liraglutide and pramlintide, all are administered orally and are thus also called oral hypoglycemic agents or oral antihyperglycemic agents.  There are different classes of anti-diabetic drugs, and their selection depends on the nature of the diabetes, age and situation of the person, as well as other factors.
Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a disease caused by the lack of insulin.  Insulin must be used in Type I, which must be injected.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a disease of insulin resistance by cells. Treatments include (1) agents that increase the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas, (2) agents that increase the sensitivity of target organs to insulin, and (3) agents that decrease the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
Several groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, are effective in Type II, often in combination. The therapeutic combination in Type II may include insulin, not necessarily because oral agents have failed completely, but in search of a desired combination of effects.  The great advantage of injected insulin in Type II is that a well-educated patient can adjust the dose, or even take additional doses, when blood glucose levels measured by the patient, usually with a simple meter, as needed by the measured amount of sugar in the blood.

Chukchi [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ʊ|k|tʃ|iː[/tpl]Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh  (Chukchee) is a Palaeosiberian language spoken by Chukchi people in the easternmost extremity of Siberia, mainly in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. According to the Russian Census of 2002, about 7,700 of the 15,700 Chukchi people speak Chukchi; knowledge of the Chukchi language is decreasing, and most Chukchis now speak the Russian language (fewer than 500 report not speaking Russian at all). Chukchi is closely related to Koryak, which is spoken by about half as many as speak Chukchi. The language, together with Koryak, Kerek, Alutor and Itelmen forms the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family.
The Chukchi and Koryaks form a cultural unit with an economy based on reindeer herding, and both have autonomy within the Russian Federation.
The ethnonym Chukchi or Chukchee is an Anglicized form of the Russian ethnonym (singular Chukcha, plural Chukchi). This came into Russian from Čävča, the term used by the Chukchis' Tungusic-speaking neighbors, itself a rendering of the Chukchi word [tpl]IPA-xx|tʃawtʃəw|[/tpl], which in Chukchi means "a man who is rich in reindeer". The Chukchis' term for themselves is [tpl]IPA|ɬəɣʔorawetɬʔat[/tpl] (singular [tpl]IPA|ɬəɣʔorawetɬʔan[/tpl]), "the real people".
In the UNESCO Red Book, the language is on the list of endangered languages.

Samuel Kanyon Doe (May 6, 1951 – September 9, 1990) was the leader of Liberia from 1980 to 1990.  He served as chairman of the People's Redemption Council and de facto head of state from 1980 until his election as the 21st President of Liberia in 1985. He was the first indigenous head of state in Liberian history.
Doe was a member of the rural Krahn tribe from inland Liberia. The Krahn people are a minority ethnic group but, like the majority of Liberians, they are of indigenous descent. Liberians of indigenous descent were historically faced with economic and political marginalization by the Americo-Liberian elites, who were descended from the free-born and formerly enslaved blacks from America who founded Liberia in 1847.
Under Doe, Liberian ports were opened to Canadian, Chinese and European ships, which brought in considerable foreign investment from foreign shipping firms and earned Liberia a reputation as a tax haven.
Doe attempted to legitimize his regime with a new constitution in 1984 and elections in 1985. However, opposition to his rule only increased, especially after the 1985 elections which were declared to be fraudulent by foreign observers, except the US which supported the Doe regime. In the late 1980s, as fiscal austerity took hold in the United States and the threat of Communism declined with the waning of the Cold War, the U.S. became disenchanted with entrenched corruption in Doe's government and began cutting off critical foreign aid to Doe. This, combined with the popular anger generated by Doe's favoritism toward his native Krahn tribe, placed him in a very precarious position.
A civil war began in December 1989, when rebels intent on toppling Doe entered Liberia through Côte d'Ivoire. Doe's forces were defeated.  He was captured and overthrown on 9 September 1990.  Following his capture, he was tortured before being executed.

They identified there as Americo Liberians. (Some African Americans, following resettlement in Canada, also participated as founding settlers in Sierra Leone and present-day Cote d'Ivoire. 
Later in Liberia, these African Americans integrated 5,000 liberated Africans called Congos (former slaves from the Congo Basins, who were freed by British and Americans from slave ships after prohibition of the African slave trade) and 346 Barbadian immigrants into the hegemony.http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/libhtml/liberia.html Like the Creoles of Freetown, Americos rarely intermarried with Native Africans.

[[The Knobz]]

CATEGORIES: New Zealand pop music groups, Musical groups established in 1979

The Knobz were a New Zealand pop band, originally based in Dunedin, but not considered part of that city's main wave of "Dunedin Sound" bands. They became famous in 1980 with their political song "Culture?" criticising Robert Muldoon, who was Prime Minister at the time and had stated that New Zealand's pop music was not culture. Muldoon had made the remarks in the context of refusing to lift a 40% tax on sales of music.
The Knobz were fairly typical of the New Zealand pop scene in the 1980s; they were described in an article of the time as "XTC meets The Knack". However, several things set them apart from their contemporaries. They were the first band to have a self-funded single hit the top 5 in New Zealand, released on Wellngton Independent Label Bunk Records owned and run by Michael Alexander. They also managed themselves and toured extensively following chart success with two further singles - "Liverpool to America" (an opportune song about John Lennon) and "K.G.B." - and, later, an album, Sudden Exposure. They were considered to be an accomplished live act.
The band toured New Zealand before leaving for Australia in 1980, where they played with other acts of the period such as Divinyls, Men at Work, Mi-Sex, Swanee and Moving Pictures. The Knobz dispersed at the end of 1981, with some of the members moving on to other projects; most notably, drummer Bob Reid went on to play for the powerhouse Sydney band The Sharks.
The Knobz later reformed with songwriter Kevin Fogarty for one more trip around New Zealand and to promote the album Roads to Rome. The new album had been written by former band members, but these were replaced with drummer Tim Powles and bassist Warwick Keay, both formerly of Flight X-7.Carey Peterson from Auckland walk and The Visitors also joined the band as vocalist to tour with the band in 1982.
In their heyday, The Knobz can be said to have epitomised the early 80s period when punk still held a slender audience and New Romantic music was starting to make an impact.

[[Private bank]]

CATEGORIES: Private banks, Banks, Wealth

Private banks are banks owned by either an individual or a general partner(s) with limited partner(s). Private banks are not incorporated. In any such case, the creditors can look to both the "entirety of the bank's assets" as well as the entirety of the sole-proprietor's/general-partners' assets.  
These banks have a long tradition in Switzerland, dating back to at least the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685). Private banks also have a long tradition in the UK where C. Hoare & Co. has been in business since 1672. 
There were many private banks in Europe, but most have now become incorporated companies, so the term is rarely true any more. Today, the term "private bank" can also refer to the financial institution specializing in financial advice and services for high-net-worth individuals (private banking).
"Private banks" can also refer to non-government owned banks in general, in contrast to government-owned (or nationalized) banks, which were prevalent in communist, socialist and some social democratic states in the 20th century.

He gained support from free black leaders in the U.S., and members of Congress for an early emigration plan. From 1815-1816, he financed and captained a successful voyage to British-ruled Sierra Leone where he helped a small group of African-American immigrants establish themselves. Cuffee believed that African Americans could more easily "rise to be a people" in Africa than in the U.S. where slavery and legislated limits on black freedom were still in place. Although Cuffee died in 1817, his early efforts to help repatriate African Americans encouraged the American Colonization Society (ACS) to lead further settlements. The ACS was made up mostly of Quakers and slaveholders, who disagreed on the issue of slavery but found common ground in support of repatriation. Friends opposed slavery but believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. The slaveholders opposed freedom for blacks, but saw repatriation as a way of avoiding rebellions[/tpl] The Liberian flag has similar red and white stripes, as well as a blue square with a white star in the canton.

The Dunkirk evacuation, code-named Operation Dynamo, also known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, was the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, France, between 27 May and 4 June 1940. The operation became necessary when large numbers of British, French, and Belgian troops were cut off and surrounded by the German army during the Battle of France in the Second World War. In a speech to the House of Commons, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called the events in France "a colossal military disaster", saying that "the whole root and core and brain of the British Army" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.[tpl]sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212[/tpl] In his We shall fight on the beaches speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a "miracle of deliverance".[tpl]sfn|Safire|2004|p=146[/tpl]
After the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, marking the beginning of the Second World War, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to aid in the defence of France. Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, and three of their Panzer corps attacked France through the Ardennes and rapidly drove to the English Channel. By 21 May, the German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French armies in an area along the northern coast of France. Commander of the BEF General John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities. A controversial Halt Order was issued with Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's approval 22 May. This gave the trapped Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops toward Dunkirk. From 28–31 May 1940, in the Siege of Lille, the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German divisions, including three armoured divisions.
On the first day of the evacuation, only 7,669 men were evacuated, but by the ninth day a total of 338,226 soldiers had been rescued by a hastily-assembled fleet of over 800 boats. Many of the troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective mole onto 39 British destroyers and other large ships, while others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in the shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried from the beaches to the larger ships by the famous little ships of Dunkirk, a flotilla of hundreds of merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft, and lifeboats called into service for the emergency. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of their tanks, vehicles, and other equipment. In his speech to the House of Commons on 4 June Churchill reminded the country that "we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations."[tpl]sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115[/tpl] The events at Dunkirk remain a prominent folk memory in the United Kingdom.

During World War II, Operation Cycle was the evacuation of Allied troops from Le Havre, France at the end of the Battle of France. From 10 to 13 June 1940, 11,059 British and Allied forces were evacuated.
As the line on the Somme was breached, the British 1st Armoured and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Divisions, along with French units tried to fall back to the coast.  Part of these groups made it, and despite the loss of the personnel ship HMS Bruges were evacuated by British destroyers and other craft.
As part of Cycle, an attempt to rescue the remaining men along a line from St. Valery-en-Caux to Veules was conducted on 10–11 June.  It was only partially successful, since thick fog hampered operations.  A total of 2137 British and 1184 French soldiers were removed, but the remainder, including over 6000 men of the Highland Division, were captured.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_cycle.html |title=Operation Cycle, the evacuation from Havre, 10-13 June 1940 |publisher=Historyofwar.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]
Cycle was preceded by the better known Operation Dynamo, the rescue of 338,226 British and French soldiers from Dunkirk from 26 May to 4 June, and followed by Operation Ariel, over 215,000 soldiers embarking from Cherbourg, St. Malo, and other ports between June 14 and 25.

Conaire Mór (the great), son of Eterscél, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. His mother was Mess Búachalla, who was either the daughter of Eochu Feidlech and Étaín, or of Eochu Airem and his daughter by Étaín. In the Old Irish saga Togail Bruidne Dá Derga he is conceived when his mother is visited by an unknown man who flies in her skylight in the form of a bird, and is brought up as Eterscél's son.
According to the Lebor Gabála Érenn He took power after killing his predecessor, and his father's killer, Nuadu Necht. In Togail Bruidne Dá Derga he succeeds Eterscél directly. When Eterscél dies, a bull-feast is held. A bull is killed, a man eats his fill of its meat and drinks its broth, and sleeps as incantations are chanted over him. Whoever this man sees in his sleep will be the new king. He sees a naked man coming along the road to Tara with a stone in his sling. The young Conaire, meanwhile, is hunting birds in his chariot. He chases them into the sea, where they become armed men, announce themselves as Conaire's father's bird troop, and inform him that it is forbidden for him to hunt birds. The leader of the bird troop tells Conaire to go naked to Tara, where he will be made king, and places several geasa (taboos) on his reign. Among other things, he may not be preceded by three red men into the house of a red man. As he approaches Tara he is met by three kings carrying clothes for him, and when he arrives he is made king.
His reign is long and mostly peaceful. His end is told in the Old Irish epic Togail Bruidne Dá Derga, "The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel", in which events conspire to make him break his geasa one by one. After he has already broken several of them, he travels south along the coast of Ireland, he is advised to stay the night at Da Derga's Hostel, but as he approaches it, he sees three men dressed in red riding red horses arriving before him. "Da Derga" means "Red God". He realises that three red men have preceded him into the house of a red man, and another of his geasa has been broken. His three foster-brothers, the three sons of Dond Désa, whom Conaire had exiled to Alba (Britain) for their crimes, had made alliance with the king of the Britons, Ingcél Cáech, and they were marauding across Ireland with a large band of followers. They attack Da Derga's Hostel. Three times they attempt to burn it down, and three times the fire is put out. Conaire, protected by his champion Mac Cécht and the Ulster hero Conall Cernach, kills six hundred before he reaches his weapons, a further six hundred with his weapons. He asks for a drink, but all the water has been used to put out the fires. Mac Cécht travels across Ireland with Conaire's cup, but none of the rivers will give him water. He returns with a cup of water just in time to see two men cutting Conaire's head off. He kills both of them. Conaire's severed head drinks the water and recites a poem praising Mac Cécht. The battle rages for three more days. Mac Cécht is killed, but Conall Cernach escapes.Jeffrey Gantz (trans.), Early Irish Myths and Sagas, Penguin Classics, 1981, pp. 37-106
He had ruled for thirty or seventy years, depending on the source consulted. The Lebor Gabála Érenn synchronises his reign with that of the Roman emperor Augustus (27 BC – AD 14), and after the birth of Christ, and makes him contemporary with legendary provincial kings Conchobar mac Nessa, Cairbre Nia Fer and Ailill mac Máta.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gabála Érenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 301 The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar Éireann dates his reign to 63–33 BC,Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar Éireann 1.37 that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 110–40 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M5090-5160
A descendant of Íar mac Dedad, Conaire belonged to the legendary Clanna Dedad, the legendary royal family of the Érainn. His descendants in Ireland and Scotland were known as the Síl Conairi. The last Gaelic king of Scotland from the line from Conaire Mór was Alexander III of Scotland.

A diocese is an administrative territorial unit governed by a bishop, of which there are currently 42 within the Church of England.  These cover all of England, and also the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, the Isles of Scilly, and a small part of Wales. The Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe is also a part of the Church of England, and covers the whole of mainland Europe, Morocco, Turkey and the territory of the former Soviet Union.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/cofeorg/|title=Organisation of the Church of England|publisher=The Church of England|accessdate=8 June 2010[/tpl]
The Anglican churches in the other constituent countries of the United Kingdom are separate entities from the Church of England, although they are full members of the worldwide Anglican Communion - see the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church of Ireland and the Church in Wales for an explanation of their diocesan organisation.
The structure of dioceses within the Church of England was initially inherited from the Roman Catholic Church as part of the Reformation. During the Reformation a number of new dioceses were founded, but no more were then created until the middle of the 19th century, when dioceses were founded mainly in response to the growing population, especially in the northern industrial cities.  The most recent to be established were created in 1927. The 42 dioceses are divided into two Provinces, the Province of Canterbury (with 30) and the Province of York (with 12).  The archbishops of Canterbury and York have pastoral oversight over the bishops within their province, along with certain other rights and responsibilities.

The Siege of Fort Texas marked the beginning of active campaigning by the armies of the United States and Mexico during the Mexican-American War. The battle is sometimes called The Siege of Fort Brown, but this is not entirely accurate — the name Fort Brown was taken from Major Jacob Brown, who was one of the two Americans killed during the engagement. Major Jacob Brown should not to be confused with the War of 1812 hero Jacob Brown.

CATEGORIES: Hygiene, Cleaning

Washing is a method of cleaning, usually with water and often some kind of soap or detergent.  Washing both body and clothing is an essential part of good hygiene and health.
Often people use soaps and detergents to assist in the emulsification of oils and dirt particles so they can be washed away. The soap can be applied directly, or with the aid of a washcloth.
People wash themselves, or bathe periodically. Infants, the sick, and people with disabilities are bathed by a caregiver, but those that can wash themselves often do so. Often a shower or a bathtub is used for washing. People bathe naked under most circumstances, and commonly do so in the privacy of their home.
In Europe, some people use a bidet to wash their external genitalia after using the toilet, as opposed to using toilet paper.
More frequent is washing of just the hands, e.g. before and after preparing food and eating, after using the toilet, after handling something dirty, etc.  Hand washing is important in reducing the spread of germs.CDC: Why Wash Your Hands?Clean Hands, Thomas Osborne, M.D.HealthReach CHC also common is washing the face, which is done after waking up, or to keep oneself cool during the day. Brushing one's teeth is also essential for hygiene and is a part of washing.
'Washing' can also refer to the washing of clothing or other cloth items, like bed sheets, whether by hand or with a washing machine. It can also refer to washing one's car, by lathering the exterior with car soap, then rinsing it off with a hose, or washing cookware.

Operation Dingson (5–18 June 1944) was an operation in the Second World War, conducted by 178 Free French paratroops of the 4th Special Air Service (SAS), commanded by Colonel Pierre-Louis Bourgoin, who jumped into German occupied France near Vannes, Morbihan, Southern Brittany, in Plumelec, on the night of 5 June 1944 (11 h 30) with Captain Pierre Marienne and 17 men, then advanced to Saint-Marcel (8–18 June).
At this time, there were approximately 100,000 German troops, and artillery, preparing to move to the Normandy landing areas.
Immediately upon landing in Brittany, on the night of 5 June 1944 (11 h 30), the Free French SAS who jumped in near Plumelec, went into action fighting against German troops (Vlassov's army).
One hour later (0 h 40), the first victim of the liberation of his country, Corporal Emile Bouétard (born 1915 in Brittany) was killed near Plumelec.
The Free French SAS established a base (Saint-Marcel) and began to arm and equip members of local resistance fighters, operating with up to 3,000 Maquis fighters. However, their base was heavily attacked by a German paratroop division on 18 June and was forced to disperse.[tpl]cite book | last = Shortt | first = James | authorlink =  | coauthors = Angus McBride | title = The Special Air Service | publisher = Osprey Publishing | year = 1981 | location =  | page=14 | url =  | isbn = 0-85045-396-8 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Beavan  | first = Colin | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Operation Jedburgh: D-Day and America's First Shadow War | publisher = Viking | year = 2006 | page=147 | url =  | isbn = 0-670-03762-1 [/tpl]

[[Operation Lost]]

CATEGORIES: Operation Overlord

During World War II, Operation Lost was a reactive seven-man Special Air Service operation inserted into Brittany alongside Operation Dingson on 22–23 June 1944. The team, drawn from officers and men of 37 Military Mission and the SAS Brigade, was originally inserted to discover what had happened to the Dingson base after it had been attacked and dispersed by German led rear area security troops.
These SAS operations trained and armed local fighters and harassed the defenders as they tried to react to the Overlord landings. The Lost team was active from 23 June to 18 July.
The team was commanded by Major Oswald A. J. Cary-Elwes, (A career soldier who subsequently rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel) who was asked to join the SAS by its first Commanding Officer David Stirling. Stirling and Cary-Elwes were friends.
The Lost team was given instructions to search for and re-organise irregular French resistance forces formerly in touch with the French SAS, but which had been attacked and dispersed into woodland. This was one of several tasks under the overall leadership of the one-armed Free French Colonel, later member of Parliament, Pierre Bourgoin (1907-1970), the CO of 4eme BIA (Bataillon de l'Infanterie de l'Air) or 2eme RCP (Regiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes), which was known, colloquially, to the British as '4 SAS'.
Cary-Elwes and his batman were eventually exfiltrated by sea from northern Brittany on July 1944, on an escape line maintained by MI9, a now-defunct branch of the British War Office Directorate of Intelligence, at this period closely integrated with the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) who had joint control of the branch and knew it as P15.

[[Surround sound]]

CATEGORIES: Consumer electronics, Virtual reality, Surround sound, Film sound production

Surround sound is a technique for enriching the sound reproduction quality of an audio source with additional audio channels from speakers that surround the listener (surround channels), providing sound from a 360° radius in the horizontal plane (2D) as opposed to "screen channels" (centre, front left, and front right) originating only from the listener's forward arc.
Surround sound is characterized by a listener location or sweet spot where the audio effects work best, and presents a fixed or forward perspective of the sound field to the listener at this location. The technique enhances the perception of sound spatialization by exploiting sound localization; a listener's ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound in direction and distance. Typically this is achieved by using multiple discrete audio channels routed to an array of loudspeakers.
There are various surround sound based formats and techniques, varying in reproduction and recording methods along with the number and positioning of additional channels.

[[Operation Cooney]]

CATEGORIES: Special Air Service, Operation Overlord, 1944 in France, World War II British Commando raids

Operation Cooney was the deployment of elements of the 4ème Bataillon d'Infanterie de l'Air  - the 4th Free French Parachute Battalion (later renamed 2ème Régiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes) - also known as 4th Special Air Service.
On 7 June 1944, the 9 aircraft of 38 Group (including two from No. 297 Squadron RAF, dropped the parachutists.
These men were to disrupt enemy communications between West Brittany and the remainder of France, and in all 58 Free French soldiers were dropped on no fewer than 18 undefended drop zones between St. Malo and Vannes.
Breaking into 18 three-man or five-man SAS teams, the commandos scattered throughout Brittany destroying railroad targets. As a sign they had passed through they tied railroad ties around trees.
Some raiders then joined the base established by the Dingson team in Saint-Marcel, Morbihan or the base established by the Samwest team in Duault, Côtes d'Armor. Part of Overlord.

[[Bus station]]

CATEGORIES: Bus stations

A bus station is a structure where city or intercity buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. It is larger than a bus stop, which is usually simply a place on the roadside, where buses can stop. It may be intended as a terminal station for a number of routes, or as a transfer station where the routes continue.
Bus station platforms may be assigned to fixed bus lines, or variable in combination with a dynamic passenger information system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vialis.nl/bin/ibp.jsp?ibpDispWhat=object&ibpPage=S13_FocusPage&ibpDispWho=STNI_ITEMS^l4429&ibpVersion=0&ibpZone=S13_Nieuwsarchief&ibpDisplay=view&|title=New hightech bus station in Amstelveen opened|date=2009-10-13|publisher=Vialis|accessdate=2010-02-07[/tpl] The latter requires fewer platforms, but does not supply the passenger the comfort of knowing the platform well in advance and waiting there.

[[Board foot]]

CATEGORIES: Units of volume, Customary units of measurement in the United States, Logging, Wood

The board-foot is a specialized unit of measure for the volume of lumber in the United States and Canada. It is the volume of a one-foot length of a board one foot wide and one inch thick.
Board-foot can be abbreviated FBM (for "foot, board measure"), BDFT, or BF. Thousand board-feet can be abbreviated as MFBM, MBFT, or MBF. Similarly, million board-feet can be abbreviated as MMFBM, MMBFT, or MMBF.
In Australia and New Zealand the term super foot or superficial foot was used to mean the same.
One board-foot equals:
Board foot is the unit of measure for rough lumber (before drying and planing with no adjustments) or planed/surfaced lumber. An example of planed lumber is softwood 2 × 4 lumber one would buy at a large lumber retailer. The 2 × 4 is actually only [tpl]convert|1+1/2| × |3+1/2|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] but the dimensions for the lumber when purchased wholesale could still be represented as full 2 × 4 lumber, although the "standard" can vary between vendors. This means that nominal lumber includes air space around the physical board when calculating board feet in some situations, while the true measurement of "board feet" should be limited to the actual dimensions of the board.
For planed lumber, board-feet refer to the nominal thickness and width of lumber, calculated in principle on its size before drying and planing. Actual length is used.
See dimensional lumber for a full discussion of the relationship of actual and nominal dimensions. Briefly, for softwoods, to convert nominal to actual, subtract [tpl]frac|4[/tpl] inch for dimensions under [tpl]convert|2|in|mm[/tpl]; subtract [tpl]frac|2[/tpl] inch for dimensions under [tpl]convert|8|in|mm|0[/tpl]; and subtract [tpl]frac|3|4[/tpl] inch for larger measurements. The system is more complicated for hardwoods.
An Essex table is a tabulation of the number of board feet in lumber of varying dimensions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Essex+table |title=Essex table | Define Essex table at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-26[/tpl]

[[Apple DOS]]
CATEGORIES: Apple II software, Apple Inc. operating systems, Disk operating systems, Discontinued operating systems

Apple DOS was the family of disk operating systems for the Apple II series of microcomputers from late 1978 through early 1983. Apple DOS had three major releases: DOS 3.1, DOS 3.2, and DOS 3.3; each one of these three releases was followed by a second, minor "bug-fix" release, but only in the case of Apple DOS 3.2 did that minor release receive its own version number, Apple DOS 3.2.1. The best-known and most-used version was Apple DOS 3.3 in the 1980 and 1983 releases. Prior to the release of Apple DOS 3.1, Apple users had to rely on audio cassette tapes for data storage and retrieval, but that method was notoriously slow, inconvenient, and unreliable.

[[R-value (insulation)]]

CATEGORIES: Building engineering, Insulators, Thermal protection, Heat transfer

An R-value is the unit thermal resistance. It is particular to each material.  In practice, it is treated as a constant, regardless of the temperature difference.  The R-value does not take other heat transfer modes into account.  In use, convective and radiative heat transfer are also important factors when choosing an insulator.
R is expressed as the thickness of the material divided by the thermal conductivity.  The unit thermal conductance of a material is denoted as C and is the reciprocal of the unit thermal resistance.  This can also be called the unit surface conductance, commonly denoted by h.McQuiston, Parker, Spitler. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning: Analysis and Design, Sixth Edition. Hoboken NJ: John Wiley and Sons Inc., 2005. The higher the number, the better the building insulation's theoretical effectiveness. 
R-value is the reciprocal of U-factor.

The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, and is considered to be a groundbreaking skyscraper. Upon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city and one of only two skyscrapers north of 14th Street – the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, one block east. The building sits on a triangular island-block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak. As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name "Flatiron" derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron.
The building, which has been called "One of the world's most iconic skyscrapers, and a quintessential symbol of New York City",Treasures of New York City: The Flatiron Building (TV, 2014) WLIW.

The Ark-La-Tex (also known as Arklatex, ArkLaTex, or more inclusively Arklatexoma) is a U.S. socio-economic region where Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma intersect.  The region contains portions of Northwest Louisiana, Northeast Texas, South Arkansas, and the Little Dixie area of Oklahoma.
The region is centered on the Shreveport/Bossier metropolitan area in Northwest Louisiana, although Marshall in Northeast Texas, Natchitoches, Louisiana, and both Texarkana, Texas and Texarkana, Arkansas retain a large degree of autonomy. Most of the region is located in the Piney Woods, an ecoregion of dense forest of mixed deciduous and conifer flora. The forests are periodically punctuated by sloughs and bayous that are linked to larger bodies of water such as Caddo Lake or the Red River. Although it is not an official US metropolitan area it has a total population of 1,043,570. Its largest city is Shreveport, Louisiana with Tyler, Texas in second, Longview, Texas in third, and Texarkana, Texas/Texarkana, Arkansas in fourth.
The area covers roughly 46,500 square miles as it is about 240 miles North to South (Mena, Arkansas in the north to Lufkin, Texas in the south) and about 194 miles East to West (El Dorado Arkansas in the East to Sulphur Springs, Texas to the West).

[[Reichenau, Switzerland]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Graubünden, Alpine Rhine basin

Reichenau is a village in the municipality of Tamins in the Canton of Graubünden, Switzerland, where the two Rhine tributaries Vorderrhein and Hinterrhein meet, forming the Alpine Rhine. 
It is a major traffic junction of the routes from Chur towards the Oberalp Pass and Lukmanier Pass and from Chur towards San Bernardino Pass and Julier Pass. 
The civilisation of the place is traced back until the year 500.  The name originates from the Benedictine Abbey of Reichenau on Reichenau Island in Lake Constance which owned properties in this area during the Middle Ages. The monastery was founded in 724 and drew to itself abbots with connections to the highest Carolingian and Ottonian society; it housed a school, and a famous scriptorium. See Abbey of Reichenau.
In the 14th century the first bridges were built over the Rhine tributaries.
A roadhouse was built 1570 to collect the bridge toll. In the 17th century the first buildings for the sovereignty of Reichenau were built which became the castle of Reichenau. The Rhaetian Railways reached Reichenau 1896.

[[Rithmomachy]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract strategy games, Recreational mathematics, History of board games

Rithmomachy (or Rithmomachia, also Arithmomachia, Rythmomachy, Rhythmomachy, or sundry other variants; sometimes known as The Philosophers' Game) is a highly complex, early European mathematical board game. The earliest known description of it dates from the eleventh century. A literal translation of the name is "The Battle of the Numbers". The game is much like chess, except most methods of capture depend on the numbers inscribed on each piece.
It has been argued that between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, "rithmomachia served as a practical exemplar for teaching the contemplative values of Boethian mathematical philosophy, which emphasized the natural harmony and perfection of number and proportion. The game, Moyer argues, was used both as a mnemonic drill for the study of Boethian number theory and, more importantly, as a vehicle for moral education, by reminding players of the mathematical harmony of creation."Sepkoski 698

The St Nazaire Raid or Operation Chariot was a successful British amphibious attack on the heavily defended Normandie dry dock at St Nazaire in German-occupied France during the Second World War. The operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy and British Commandos under the auspices of Combined Operations Headquarters on 28 March 1942. St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs, such as the Tirpitz, to return to home waters rather than having a safe haven available on the Atlantic coast.
The obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown, accompanied by 18 smaller craft, crossed the English Channel to the Atlantic coast of France and was rammed into the Normandie dock gates. The ship had been packed with delayed-action explosives, well hidden within a steel and concrete case, that detonated later that day, putting the dock out of service for the remainder of the war and up to ten years after. A force of commandos landed to destroy machinery and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank, set ablaze or immobilised all the small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England; the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape overland. They were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded.
After the raid 228 men of the force of 622 returned to Britain; 169 were killed and 215 became prisoners of war. German casualties were over 360 dead, mostly killed after the raid when Campbeltown exploded. To recognise their bravery, 89 decorations were awarded to members of the raiding party, including five Victoria Crosses. After the war St Nazaire was one of 38 battle honours awarded to the Commandos; the operation has since become known as The Greatest Raid of All within military circles.

CATEGORIES: American nuclear weapons testing, Peaceful nuclear explosions

Project Plowshare was the overall United States term for the development of techniques to use nuclear explosives for peaceful construction purposes. The phrase was coined in 1961, taken from Isaiah 2:3–5 ("And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more"). It was the US portion of what are called Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNE).
Successful demonstrations of non-combat uses for nuclear explosives include rock blasting, stimulation of tight gas, chemical element manufacture (test shot Anacostia resulted in Curium-250m being discovered), unlocking some of the mysteries of the so-called "r-Process" of stellar nucleosynthesis and probing the composition of the Earth's deep crust, creating reflection seismology Vibroseis data which has helped geologists and follow on mining company prospecting.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/reports/plowshar.pdf  |title=Isotope recovery; neutron physics experiment; examination of heat recovery; seismic measurements; and explosive development.[/tpl]http://symposia.obs.carnegiescience.edu/series/symposium4/ms/becker.ps.gzhttp://www.ociw.edu/ociw/symposia/series/symposium4/proceedings.html

[tpl]nihongo|Princess Tutu|プリンセスチュチュ|Purinsesu Chuchu[/tpl] is a metafictional, ballet-themed magical girl, dramatic-musical anime series created by Ikuko Itoh in 2002 for animation studio Hal Film Maker. The first season of the anime series was broadcast in Japan in 2002 and the second season in 2004. The anime series was also adapted into a two-volume manga. Both the manga and anime series were licensed by ADV Films in 2004 for distribution in North America.
The series explores the concepts of fate and free will. Reviewers point out that although Princess Tutu is nominally a magical girl series, it is more of a "fairy tale set to ballet with a few magical girl elements mixed in," and its use of dance in lieu of violence to solve conflicts carries "surprisingly effective emotional appeal."

Hamilton joined Chelsea as a junior and became the Stamford Bridge club's youngest ever player and goalscorer at 16 years, 138 days when he scored against Tottenham Hotspur on his debut, on 18 March 1967, a feat which earned comparisons with another famous Chelsea striker who also scored on his debut against Spurs – Jimmy Greaves.[tpl]cite news |title=Master And Pupil Find Scoring Touch |newspaper=The Times |date=20 March 1967 |page=9[/tpl] Thereafter he played only four more first-team games for Chelsea, spending the 1968–69 season with Southend United before moving to Aston Villa in 1968.

CATEGORIES: Skuas, Birds of Europe, Birds of Western Australia, Birds of Cameroon, Birds of Ukraine

The Long-tailed Jaeger (Stercorarius longicaudus) (known as the Long-tailed Skua outside the Americas) is a seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae.
This is the smallest of the skua family at [tpl]convert|38|-|58|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], depending on season and age. However, much of this, up to [tpl]convert|29|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], is comprised by the tail which may include the [tpl]convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] tail streamers of the summer adult. The wingspan of this species ranges from [tpl]convert|102|to|117|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and the body mass is [tpl]convert|230|-|444|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl].CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), ISBN 978-0-8493-4258-5.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/long-tailed-jaeger/stercorarius-longicaudus/ |title=Long-tailed jaeger videos, photos and facts - Stercorarius longicaudus |publisher=ARKive |accessdate=2011-10-20[/tpl]
This species breeds in the high Arctic of Eurasia and North America, with major populations in Russia, Alaska and Canada and smaller populations around the rest of the Arctic.  It is a migrant, wintering in the south Atlantic and Pacific. Passage juvenile birds sometimes hunt small prey in ploughed fields or golf-courses, and are typically quite fearless of humans.
They nest on dry tundra or higher fells laying two spotted olive-brown eggs.  On the breeding grounds they can be heard making yelping and rattling sounds.  Outside of the breeding season they spend most of their time over open ocean and have a harsh kreeah cry.  This bird feeds on fish (mainly caught from other seabirds), smaller birds, food scraps, small mammals, fruit and carrion. On migration, Long-tailed Jaegers are more likely to catch their own food, and less likely to steal from gulls and terns than larger species.
This species is unmistakable as an adult, with grey back, dark primary wing feathers without a white "flash", black cap and very long tail. Adults often hover over their breeding territories.  Juveniles are much more problematic, and are difficult to separate from Parasitic Jaeger over the sea. They are slimmer, longer-winged and more tern-like than that species, but show the same wide range of plumage variation. However, they are usually colder toned than Arctic, with greyer shades, rather than brown.

[[Exogamy]]

CATEGORIES: Population genetics, Types of marriage

Exogamy is a social arrangement where marriage is allowed only outside of a social group. The social groups define the scope and extent of exogamy, and the rules and enforcement mechanisms that ensure its continuity. In social studies, exogamy is viewed as a combination of two related aspects: biological and cultural. Biological exogamy is marriage of non blood-related beings, regulated by forms of incest law. A form of exogamy is a dual exogamy, in which two groups engage in continual wife exchange.New Zealand Slavonic journal, Victoria University of Wellington, 2002, Volumes 35-36, p.81 http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-zealand-slavonic-journal/oclc/297663912 Cultural exogamy is the marrying outside of a specific cultural group. The opposite of exogamy is endogamy, a marriage within a social group.

The Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, was a major World War II campaign, in which the Allies took Sicily from the Axis Powers (Italy and Nazi Germany). It was a large scale amphibious and airborne operation, followed by six weeks of land combat. It launched the Italian Campaign.
Husky began on the night of 9–10 July 1943, and ended on 17 August. Strategically, Husky achieved the goals set out for it by Allied planners.  The Allies drove Axis air, land and naval forces from the island; the Mediterranean's sea lanes were opened and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was toppled from power. It opened the way to the Allied invasion of Italy.

Nad Tatrou sa blýska ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈnat tatrou sa ˈbliːska|sk[/tpl]) ([tpl]lang-en|Lightning over the Tatras[/tpl]) is the national anthem of Slovakia. The origins of the anthem are in the Central European activism of the 19th century. Its main themes are a storm over the Tatra mountains that symbolized danger to the Slovaks, and a desire for a resolution of the threat. It used to be particularly popular during the 1848–1849 insurgencies.
During the days of Czechoslovakia, the anthem was played in many Slovak towns at noon. This tradition ceased to exist after the two nations split. Nad Tatrou sa blýska is now performed mainly at special events, including sporting events.

[[Wallpaper]]

CATEGORIES: Wallcoverings, Ornaments, Paper products, Printmaking

Wallpaper is a kind of material used to cover and decorate the interior walls of homes, offices, and other buildings; it is one aspect of interior decoration. It is usually sold in rolls and is put onto a wall using wallpaper paste. Wallpapers can come plain as "lining paper" (so that it can be painted or used to help cover uneven surfaces and minor wall defects thus giving a better surface), textured (such as Anaglypta), with a regular repeating pattern design, or, much less commonly today, with a single non-repeating large design carried over a set of sheets. 
Wallpaper printing techniques include surface printing, gravure printing, silk screen-printing, rotary printing, and digital printing. Wallpaper is made in long rolls, which are hung vertically on a wall. Patterned wallpapers are designed so that the pattern "repeats", and thus pieces cut from the same roll can be hung next to each other so as to continue the pattern without it being easy to see where the join between two pieces occurs. In the case of large complex patterns of images this is normally achieved by starting the second piece halfway into the length of the repeat, so that if the pattern going down the roll repeats after 24 inches the next piece sideways is cut from the roll to begin 12 inches down the pattern from the first. The number of times the pattern repeats horizontally across a roll does not matter for this purpose.Mathematically speaking, there are seventeen basic patterns, described as wallpaper groups, that can be used to tile an infinite plane. All manufactured wallpaper patterns are based on these groups. Wallpapers with a large figurative pattern are likely to be in group "p1". A single pattern can be issued in several different colorways.

[[Time preference]]

CATEGORIES: Intertemporal economics, Economic theories, Interest rates

In economics, time preference (or "discounting") is the relative valuation placed on a good at an earlier date compared with its valuation at a later date.Time Discounting and Time Preference. JEL 2002 http://sds.hss.cmu.edu/media/pdfs/loewenstein/TimeDiscounting.pdf
There is no absolute distinction that separates "high" and "low" time preference, only comparisons with others either individually or in aggregate. Someone with a high time preference is focused substantially on his well-being in the present and the immediate future relative to the average person, while someone with low time preference places more emphasis than average on their well-being in the further future.
Time preferences are captured mathematically in the discount function. The higher the time preference, the higher the discount placed on returns receivable or costs payable in the future.
The time preference that an individual exhibits at any given moment is determined solely by their personal preferences.  As such, if one "prefers" to save his money but cannot do so in the present, he is still considered to have a low time-preference. One of the factors that may determine an individual's time preference is how long that individual has lived. An older individual may have a lower time preference (relative to what he had earlier in life) due to a higher income and to the fact that he has had more time to acquire durable commodities (such as a college education or a house).
The time preference theory of interest is an attempt to explain interest through the demand for accelerated satisfaction. This is particularly important in microeconomics.
In the neoclassical theory of interest due to Irving Fisher, the interest rate determines the relative price of present and future consumption. Time preference, in conjunction with relative levels of present and future consumption, determines the marginal rate of substitution between present and future consumption. These two rates must necessarily be equal, and this equilibrium is brought about by the relative prices of present and future consumption.
A practical example is if Jim and Bob go out for a drink and Jim has no money, so Bob lends Jim 10 euro. The next day Bob comes back to Jim, and Jim says, "Bob you can have 10 euro now, or at the end of the month when I get paid I will give you 15 euro." Bob's time preference would change depending on if he trusted Jim, how much he needs the money now, or thinks he can wait or would prefer to have 15 euro at the end of the month than 10 now. So present and expected needs, present and expected income affect the time preference.

Monro was born in Brussels, but his parents were Scottish.  He was educated at Radley and at Caius College, Cambridge.[tpl]acad|id=MNR898HE|name=Monro, Harold Edward[/tpl]  His first collection of poetry was published in 1906.  He edited a poetry magazine, The Poetry Review, which was to be very influential. In 1912, he founded the Poetry Bookshop in Bloomsbury, London, publishing new collections at his own expense and rarely making a profit, as well as providing a welcoming environment for readers and poets alike.  Several poets, including Wilfred Owen, actually lodged in the rooms above the bookshop.  Monro was also  closely involved with Edward Marsh in the publication of the Georgian Poetry series, which the Poetry Bookshop published.
After the War, Monro wrote his somewhat trenchant overview Some Contemporary Poets (1920). Monro, H., 1920."Some Contemporary Poets (1920)", London: Leonard Parsons. (though this was not published by the Poetry Bookshop).
Although homosexual, he married before World War I, but he and his wife separated and were divorced in 1916.  In 1917, he was called up for military service, a very unhappy experience for him.  His health soon gave way, and he returned to run the Poetry Bookshop in 1919.  He was not a mainstream war poet, but did occasionally write about the subject.  In 1920, he married his long-standing assistant, Alida Klementaski.  Their relationship seems to have been an intellectual rather than a physical one.  Monro continued to suffer from alcoholism, which contributed to his early death.

The Second Severn Crossing ([tpl]lang-cy|Ail Groesfan Hafren[/tpl]) is the M4 motorway bridge over the River Severn between England and Wales, inaugurated on 5 June 1996 by HRH The Prince of Wales to augment the traffic capacity of the original Severn Bridge built in 1966. The bridge marks the lower limit of the River Severn and the start of the Severn Estuary.
Its location is farther to the south than the old bridge and, being more in line with the landward sides of the M4 motorway, is a shorter journey when travelling between England and South Wales. The junctions at each end are designed for most traffic to use this crossing – to use the old Severn Bridge crossing one has to leave the M4 and join the M48 motorway either at Aust or near Magor. The new crossing carries more traffic than the Severn Bridge, which is still in use. It is wider than the Severn Bridge, having three lanes and narrow hard shoulder each way, compared to the two lanes, cycle path and footpath of the original crossing. The path taken by the bridge is close to that of the Severn Tunnel which has carried the railway line beneath the river bed since 1886.
Much of the estuary is mudflats at low tide, but at high tide can be covered by up to 14 metres of water.  This presented the engineers with a unique set of constraints with packets of work being scheduled at low tide and being completed with the short windows allowed by the tides.
The concession given to the consortium which financed, built and operate the bridge required them to take over the outstanding debt on the original Severn Bridge and to operate the two bridges as a single entity. Tolls are set annually by the government based on the change in the previous year's Retail Price Index. On the expiry of the concession the consortium is required to hand the bridge over into public ownership. It was reported in 2012, that the process of repayment was likely to continue until the early 2020s due to the introduction of a revised settlement to the operator in return for accepting payment by debit and credit cards.  As part of the announcement, it was stated that even after repayment was complete the toll charge would likely remain at the same levels.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-19967175

During World War II, Operation Narcissus was a raid by forty members of the Special Air Service on a lighthouse on the southeast coast of Sicily. The team landed on 10 July 1943 with the mission of capturing the lighthouse and the surrounding high ground.
Despite intelligence reports, the area was deserted, and so the position was no threat to the nearby Husky landings. The troopers withdrew without a shot being fired.

Operation ''Ladbroke'' was a glider landing of British airborne forces near Syracuse, Sicily, that began on 9 July 1943 as part of the Allied invasion of the island. The first Allied mission using large numbers of the aircraft, the operation was carried out from Tunisia by the 1st Airlanding Brigade, with a force of 136 Wacos and eight Horsas. The objective was to establish a large invasion force on the ground near the town of Syracuse, secure the Ponte Grande Bridge and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically vital docks, as a prelude to the full-scale invasion of Sicily.
En route to Sicily, sixty-five gliders released too early by the American and British towing aircraft crashed into the sea, drowning approximately 252 men. Of the remainder, only eighty-seven men arrived at the Pont Grande Bridge, although they successfully captured the bridge and held it beyond the time they were to be relieved. Finally, with their ammunition expended and only fifteen soldiers remaining unwounded, the Allied troops surrendered to Italian forces. The Italians, having gained control of the bridge, sought to destroy the structure, but were frustrated by soldiers of 1st Brigade who had removed the previously attached explosive charges.  Other troops from the airlanding brigade, who had landed elsewhere in Sicily aided further by destroying communications links and capturing gun batteries.

The Poetry Bookshop operated at 35 Devonshire Street (now Boswell Street) in the Bloomsbury district of central London, from 1913 to 1926. It was the brainchild of Harold Monro, and was supported by his moderate income.Joy Grant, Harold Monro and the Poetry Bookshop (Berkeley, 1967) 
The Bookshop not only sold, but also published, poetry by living poets.  Readers were encouraged to browse, and several poets actually made their home there, including Wilfred Owen, Wilson Gibson and Robert Frost.  The atmosphere was welcoming, and the shop's best-sellers were hand-coloured rhyme sheets for children.
During World War I, when Monro was serving in the armed forces, the shop was run almost single-handed by his assistant, Alida Klementaski, whom he later married.
Among the works published by the Poetry Bookshop were collections by Charlotte Mew and Richard Aldington and the Georgian Poetry series as well as Ezra Pound's seminal 1914 anthology Des Imagistes.
Penelope Fitzgerald for quite a few years attempted to interest a publisher in a book on the shop.  Her letters reveal the amount of work she did, some of which was useful to her when she wrote her biography of Charlotte Mew.

[[Operation Fustian]]

Operation Fustian was a British airborne forces mission during the Allied invasion of Sicily in the Second World War. The operation was carried out by the 1st Parachute Brigade, part of the 1st Airborne Division. Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River. The intention was for the brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land on both sides of the river. They would then capture the bridge and secure the surrounding area until relieved by the advance of XIII Corps, which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously. Because the bridge was the only crossing on the river, and would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, its capture was expected to speed the advance and lead to the eventual defeat of the Axis forces in Sicily.
The operation encountered multiple obstacles and met heavy opposition. Many of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down or were damaged and turned back, due to both friendly fire and enemy action. The evasive action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area, and only the equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in the correct locations. Despite this and the defence by German and Italian forces, the British paratroops captured the bridge. Resisting all attacks, they held out against increasing odds until nightfall.
The relieving force led by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, which was short of transport, had their own problems trying to reach the parachute brigade and were still [tpl]convert|1|mi[/tpl] away when they halted for the night. By this time, with casualties mounting and supplies running short, the parachute brigade commander, Gerald Lathbury, had relinquished control of the bridge to the Germans. The following day the British units joined forces, and the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry with armour support attempted to recapture the bridge. The bridge was not finally secured until three days after the start of the operation, when another battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, led by the paratroopers, established a bridgehead on the northern bank of the river.
The eventual capture of Primosole Bridge did not lead to the expected rapid advance, as by this time the Germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line. It was not until early the following month that the Eighth Army captured Catania. By this time the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had taken no further part in the conquest of Sicily, had been withdrawn back to Malta. However, many lessons had been learned during the operation, which were put into practice for future Allied airborne operations.

[[Operation Corkscrew]]
CATEGORIES: World War II operations and battles of the Italian Campaign, Allied invasion of Sicily

Operation Corkscrew was the Allied invasion of the Italian island of Pantelleria (between Sicily and Tunisia) on 11 June 1943. There had been an early plan to occupy the island in late 1940 (Operation Workshop), but this was aborted when the Luftwaffe strengthened the Axis air threat in the region.
The Allied focus returned to Pantelleria in early 1943. The radar installations and airfield on the island were seen as a real threat to the planned invasion of Sicily. The Italian garrison on the island was 12,000 strong in well-entrenched pillboxes and 21 gun batteries of a variety of calibres. In addition, there was an opportunity to assess the impact of bombardment upon heavily fortified defences.[tpl]cite book| publisher=US Air Force, Air Force Historical Research Agency| series=monograph  52| title=The Reduction of Pantelleria and Adjacent Islands, 8 May-14 June 1943| first=Edith C.| last=Rogers| year=1947| url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-090529-104.pdf |accessdate=30 March 2009[/tpl] It was decided to see if the island could be forced into submission by aerial and naval bombardment alone. Failing this, an amphibious invasion was planned for 11 June.
Starting in late May, the island was subjected to steadily increasing bombing attacks. In early June, the attacks intensified and 14,203 bombs amounting to 4,119 tons were dropped on 16 Italian batteries. On 8 June, a Royal Navy task-force of five cruisers, eight destroyers and three torpedo boats carried out a bombardment of the main port on the island. The engagement was observed by General Eisenhower and Admiral Cunningham from the flagship Aurora.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iLtSAAAAIBAJ&jtp=1|title=The Evening Independent - Jun 11, 1943|website=Google News Archive|accessdate=23 May 2013[/tpl] From 8 May to 11 June 5, 285 bombing sorties were flown by fighter-bombers, medium and heavy bombers, dropping a total of 6,202 tons of bombs on the island.
Two demands for the garrison to surrender went unanswered and, on 11 June, the amphibious assault went ahead. About an hour before the landing craft reached the beaches, the accompanying ships opened fire. Unknown to the attackers, the commander of the garrison on Pantelleria had sought permission to surrender from Rome the previous evening and received it that morning. When the first of the British Commandos landed, the Italians surrendered. Winston Churchill was to record later in his memoirs that the only British casualty was a man bitten by a mule.
An assessment by British analyst Professor Sir Solly Zuckerman reported that the defenses had been reduced to 47% effectiveness. The intense ten-day air bombardment had substantially reduced the defenses. Out of 80 guns bombed, 43 were damaged (10 beyond repair). All control communications were destroyed together with many gun emplacements, ammunition stores, air-raid shelters.  The ease of the operation led to an optimistic assessment of the effectiveness of bombing, which was not always borne out in practice.
The Italian garrisons on other nearby islands (Lampedusa and Linosa) quickly fell. This cleared the way for the invasion of Sicily a month later.

During World War II, Operation Chestnut was a failed British raid by 2 Special Air Service, conducted in support of the Allied invasion of Sicily. 
Two teams of ten men each, codenamed 'Pink' and 'Brig', parachuted into northern Sicily on the night of 12 July 1943, to disrupt communications, transport and the enemy in general. All radios were broken and much ammunition, explosives and food lost in the jump. One team landed near an inhabited area, alerting the defenders. 
Without radios neither team was able to contact and direct the planes bringing in reinforcements, which subsequently returned to base without any drops being made. The raiders were unable to achieve anything worthwhile and worked their way towards friendly lines evading the enemy.
This was the first parachute raid for 2 SAS, and also the raid when Maj. Geoffrey Appleyard, (former commander of the Small Scale Raiding Force), was lost. Appleyard was aboard the plane carrying 'Pink' team as drop supervisor. After the drop was made the plane failed to return to base.

[[Operation Barclay]]
CATEGORIES: World War II deception operations, Allied invasion of Sicily, Code names

Operation Barclay was a World War II deception by the Allies in support of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.
The goal was to deceive the Axis powers as to the location of the Allies' assault across the Mediterranean and to divert the Axis military commands attention and resources. Operation Barclay used bogus troop movements, radio traffic, recruitment of Greek interpreters, and acquisition of Greek maps to indicate an invasion through the Balkans.[tpl]cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Donald J. |title=Second World War Deception: Lessons Learned for Today’s Joint Planner  |url= http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/wright/wf05.pdf |accessdate=24 April 2013 |date=December 1998 |publisher=Air University Press |location=Montgomery, Alabama |pages=3–4 [/tpl]
Operation Barclay created a sham army in the eastern Mediterranean: the "Twelfth Army" consisting of 12 fictitious divisions. Adolf Hitler suspected that the Allies would invade Europe through the Balkans, and Barclay served to reinforce this.
As part of Barclay the British also launched "Operation Mincemeat", where faked documents were planted via Spain. To reinforce the impression that an Allied invasion was imminent the Special Operations Executive (SOE), in co-operation with the Greek andartes, mounted "Operation Animals", a series of attacks on rail and road networks.[tpl]cite journal |last=Gerolymatos |first=André |authorlink=André Gerolymatos |year=1991 |title=The Development of Guerrilla Warfare and British Policy Toward Greece 1943-1944 |journal=Journal of the Hellenic Diaspora |issue=17 |page=p.100 |location=New York City |publisher=Pella Publishing Co. |accessdate=24 April 2013 |url=http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/5569/Gerolymatos_17_2.pdf [/tpl]
The deception was successful. The German High Command concluded there was a greater concentration of Allied forces in the eastern Mediterranean than was the case and held to this assessment, making subsequent deceptions more credible. German forces in the Balkans were reinforced from 8 to 18 divisions, and the Italian fleet diverted into the Adriatic Sea. The Allied invasion of Sicily thus achieved surprise.
The greatly increased number of German occupying forces in Greece resulted in negative consequences for the Greek Resistance. Wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations were carried out, culminating in mass reprisals such as the Massacre of Kalavryta and Distomo massacre.

It is informally referred to as "Latin-2". It is generally intended for “Eastern European” languages that are written in the Latin script. Note that ISO/IEC 8859-2 is very different from code page 852 (MS-DOS Latin 2, PC Latin 2) which is also referred to as "Latin-2" in Czech and Slovak regions.The Czech and Slovak Character Encoding Mess Explained
ISO-8859-2 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. Microsoft has assigned code page 28592 aka Windows-28592 to ISO-8859-2 in Windows.
Codepage 1250 aka Windows-1250 has many of the same characters but in a different arrangement.
These code values can be used for the following languages: 
It can also be used for Romanian, but it is unsuitable for that language, because of lack of letters s and t with commas below, containing s and t with cedillas instead. These letters were unified in the first versions of the Unicode standard, meaning that the appearance with cedilla or with comma was treated as a glyph choice rather than as separate characters; fonts intended for use with Romanian should, therefore, have characters with comma below at those code points. Still, ISO/IEC 8859-2 and Windows-1250 (with the same problem) have been heavily used for Romanian. Unicode (which supports both variants) has taken the lead for web pages, which however often have s and t with cedilla anyway.

[[Rumor]]
CATEGORIES: Human communication

A rumor or rumour (spelling differs between American and International English) is often viewed as "a tall tale of explanations of events circulating from person to person and pertaining to an object, event, or issue in public concern".(33)[ref]
</ref> However, a review of the research on rumor conducted by Pendleton in 1998 found that research across [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and communication studies had widely varying definitions of rumor.<ref>Pendleton, S.c. (1998), 'Rumor research revisited and expanded', Language&
Communication, vol. 1. no. 18, pp. 69-86.
[/ref]
Thus, rumor is a concept that lacks a particular definition in the social sciences. But most theories agree that rumor involves some kind of a statement whose veracity is not quickly or ever confirmed. In addition, some scholars have identified rumor as a subset of propaganda, the latter another notoriously difficult concept to define. A pioneer of propaganda studies, Harold Lasswell defined propaganda in 1927 as referring "solely to the control of opinion by significant symbols, or, to speak more concretely and less accurately, by stories, rumors, reports, pictures, and other forms of social communication" (1927:9).Propaganda Technique in the World War (1927; Reprinted with a new introduction, 1971) 
Rumors are also often discussed with regard to "misinformation" and "disinformation" (the former often seen as simply false and the latter seen as deliberately false, though usually from a government source given to the media or a foreign government).from Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1989 Rumors thus have often been viewed as particular forms of other communication concepts.

[[Five-second rule]]
CATEGORIES: Food safety, Rules of thumb, American cultural conventions, Urban legends, Fictional science, Misconceptions

In folklore, the five-second rule states that food dropped on the ground will not be significantly contaminated with bacteria if it is picked up within five seconds of being dropped.  Some may earnestly believe this assertion, whereas other people employ the rule as a polite social fiction that allows them to still eat a lightly contaminated piece of food, despite the potential reservations of their peers.
There can be many variations on the rule where the time limit is modified. In some cases, the person picking up the food arbitrarily extends the time limit based on the actual amount of time required to retrieve the food.

[[Handsfree]]

CATEGORIES: Automotive technologies, Road accidents

Handsfree is an adjective describing equipment that can be used without the use of hands (for example via voice commands) or, in a wider sense, equipment which needs only limited use of hands, or for which the controls are positioned so that the hands are able to occupy themselves with another task (such as driving) without needing to hunt far afield for the controls.New York TimesNew York TimesNew York Times
Devices that are typically used for handsfree communication use Bluetooth as its wireless technology. They still require a mobile phone or other device to initiate a call. These devices include Bluetooth headsets, hands-free car kits (HFCK), and personal navigation devices (PND). Originally introduced as optional features connected by a wire to mobile phones or other communication devices, they now generally are available with wireless technology. 
Bluetooth handsfree options are now also easily found in any high end automotive as part of the vehicle's stereo system, or in after market stereo system units. This option utilizes the vehicle's speakers to transmit the caller's voice in the phone call and have an embedded microphone in the stereo unit itself, the steering wheel, or use a separate wired microphone that can be placed anywhere in the vehicle.New York Times

The Minnesota River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately 332 miles (534 km) long, in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It drains a watershed of nearly [tpl]convert|17,000|sqmi|km2[/tpl], [tpl]convert|14,751|sqmi|km2[/tpl] in Minnesota and about [tpl]convert|2,000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] in South Dakota and Iowa.
It rises in southwestern Minnesota, in Big Stone Lake on the Minnesota–South Dakota border just south of the Laurentian Divide at the Traverse Gap portage. It flows southeast to Mankato, then turns northeast. It joins the Mississippi south of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, near the historic Fort Snelling. The valley is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota. Of Dakota language origin, the name Minnesota means "sky-tinted water or cloudy-sky water", from mní (often transcribed as "minne" or "mini") meaning "water" and sóta meaning "sky-tinted" or "cloudy sky", and, refers to the milky-brown color its waters take on when at flood stage. An illustration of the meaning of these words was shown by dropping a little milk into water.  For over a century prior to the organization of the Minnesota Territory in 1849, the name St. Pierre (St. Peter) had been generally applied to the river by French and English explorers and writers.  Minnesota River is shown on the 1757 edition of Mitchell Map as "Ouadebameniſsouté Mnísota'' or R. St. Peter".  On June 19, 1852, acting upon a request from the Minnesota territorial legislature, the United States Congress decreed the aboriginal name for the river, Minnesota, to be the river’s official name and ordered all agencies of the federal government to use that name when referencing it."Minnesota State". Minnesota Historical Society. http://mnplaces.mnhs.org/upham/otheritem.cfm?PlaceNameID=2007&BookCodeID=67&County=0&SendingPage=Results.cfm. Retrieved 2010-03-21
The valley that the Minnesota River flows in is up to five miles (8 km) wide and 250 feet (80 m) deep.Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot, pp. 118-19. It was carved into the landscape by the massive glacial River Warren between 11,700 and 9,400 years ago at the end of the last ice age in North America.  Pierre-Charles Le Sueur was the first European to visit the river.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] The Minnesota Territory, and later the state, were named for the river.

Timbuktu ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɪ|m|b|ʌ|k|ˈ|t|uː[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Tombouctou[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-fr|tɔ̃bukˈtu|[/tpl]; Koyra Chiini: Tumbutu), formerly also spelled Timbuctoo and Timbuktoo, is a city in the West African nation of Mali situated [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] north of the River Niger on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The town is the capital of the Timbuktu Region, one of the eight administrative regions of Mali. It had a population of 54,453 in the 2009 census.
Starting out as a seasonal settlement, Timbuktu became a permanent settlement early in the 12th century. After a shift in trading routes, Timbuktu flourished from the trade in salt, gold, ivory and slaves. It became part of the Mali Empire early in the 14th century. In the first half of the 15th century the Tuareg tribes took control of the city for a short period until the expanding Songhai Empire absorbed the city in 1468. A Moroccan army defeated the Songhai in 1591, and made Timbuktu, rather than Gao, their capital.
The invaders established a new ruling class, the arma, who after 1612 became virtually independent of Morocco. However, the golden age of the city was over and it entered a long period of decline. Different tribes governed until the French took over in 1893, a situation that lasted until it became part of the current Republic of Mali in 1960. Presently, Timbuktu is impoverished and suffers from desertification.
In its Golden Age, the town's numerous Islamic scholars and extensive trading network made possible an important book trade: together with the campuses of the Sankore Madrasah, an Islamic university, this established Timbuktu as a scholarly centre in Africa. Several notable historic writers, such as Shabeni and Leo Africanus, have described Timbuktu. These stories fueled speculation in Europe, where the city's reputation shifted from being extremely rich to being mysterious. This reputation overshadows the town itself in modern times, to the point where it is best known in Western culture as an expression for a distant or outlandish place.
On 1 April 2012, one day after the capture of Gao, Timbuktu was captured from the Malian military by the Tuareg rebels of the MNLA and Ansar Dine.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/mali-coup-leader-reinstates-1403759.html |title=Mali coup leader reinstates old constitution |author=Callimachi, Rukmini |date=1 April 2012 |work= The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl].

On 28 January 2013, French and Malian government troops began retaking Timbuktu from the Islamist rebels.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/us-mali-rebels-idUSBRE90O0C720130128 |title=French seal off Mali's Timbuktu, rebels torch library |author= Diarra, Adam |publisher=Reuters |date=28 January 2013[/tpl] The force of 1,000 French troops with 200 Malian soldiers retook Timbuktu without a fight.

The building housing the Ahmed Baba Institute was funded by South Africa, and held 30,000 manuscripts.  BBC World Service radio news reported on 29 January 2013 that approximately 28,000 of the manuscripts in the Institute had been removed to safety from the premises before the attack by the Islamist groups, and that the whereabouts of about 2,000 manuscripts remained unknown.[tpl]cite news|last=Shamil|first=Jeppie|title=Timbuktu Manuscripts Project|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21242689|accessdate=29 January 2013|publisher =BBC News|date=29 January 2013[/tpl] Also broadcast BBC World Service news on 29 January 2013.

On 30 March, jihadist rebels infiltrated into Timbuktu just nine days prior to a suicide bombing on a Malian army checkpoint at the international airport killing a soldier. Fighting lasted until 1 April, when French warplanes helped Malian ground forces chase the remaining rebels out of the city center.

Topfreedom is a cultural and political movement seeking to advance gender equality by the recognition of the right of women and girls to be topless in public on the same basis that men and boys are permitted to be barechested. In addition, topfreedom advocates seek recognition of the right of nursing mothers to openly breastfeed in public, and of women to sun bathe topless. In North America, the Topfree Equal Rights Association assists women who have been charged for being topless, while GoTopless organizes demonstrations to protest against the legal and public attitude to the inequality. In Sweden, Bara Bröst is active in advancing topfreedom, as is Topless Front in Denmark.

James Russell Lowell ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|oʊ|əl[/tpl]; February 22, 1819 – August 12, 1891) was an American Romantic poet, critic, editor, and diplomat. He is associated with the Fireside Poets, a group of New England writers who were among the first American poets who rivaled the popularity of British poets. These poets usually used conventional forms and meters in their poetry, making them suitable for families entertaining at their fireside.
Lowell graduated from Harvard College in 1838, despite his reputation as a troublemaker, and went on to earn a law degree from Harvard Law School. He published his first collection of poetry in 1841 and married Maria White in 1844. He and his wife had several children, though only one survived past childhood. The couple soon became involved in the movement to abolish slavery, with Lowell using poetry to express his anti-slavery views and taking a job in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper. After moving back to Cambridge, Lowell was one of the founders of a journal called The Pioneer, which lasted only three issues. He gained notoriety in 1848 with the publication of A Fable for Critics, a book-length poem satirizing contemporary critics and poets. The same year, he published The Biglow Papers, which increased his fame. He went on to publish several other poetry collections and essay collections throughout his literary career.
Maria White died in 1853, and Lowell accepted a professorship of languages at Harvard in 1854; he continued to teach there for twenty years. He traveled to Europe before officially assuming his role in 1856. He married his second wife, Frances Dunlap, shortly thereafter in 1857. That year Lowell also became editor of The Atlantic Monthly. It was not until 20 years later that Lowell received his first political appointment, the ambassadorship to the Kingdom of Spain. He was later appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's. He spent his last years in Cambridge, in the same estate where he was born, and died there in 1891.
Lowell believed that the poet played an important role as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, Lowell's commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. Lowell attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as Lowell's many satires, was an inspiration to writers like Mark Twain and H.L. Mencken.

[[Dizzy (series)]]

CATEGORIES: Video game franchises, Video games developed in the United Kingdom, Dizzy

The Dizzy series of computer games, published by Codemasters, was one of the most successful European computer game brands of the late 1980s. The games were based around a central figure: an intelligent egg-like creature called Dizzy. The games would typically involve Dizzy trying to save his friends and family, the Yolkfolk, often from the schemes of his nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks.
Most of the games in the series were platform games, with an emphasis on puzzle solving, similar to graphic adventures. Dizzy would roam around various fairytale-like locations, collecting objects, interacting with other characters, and solving logical puzzles. Rather than jumping in the conventional platform-game way, Dizzy would somersault and roll around the landscape; hence the name "Dizzy". The eight games which follow this style, usually referred to as the arcade adventures, are considered the 'core' games in the series; however, several spin-off titles were released, including Fast Food, Kwik Snax and Dizzy Down the Rapids.
Four games in the series were included in the Top 50 best games of all time in a special issue of Your Sinclair magazine in 2004.[tpl]cite journal|title=Top 50 Games of All Time|journal=Your Sinclair|date=November 2004|publisher=Imagine Publishing[/tpl]

[[Double bond]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding

A double bond in chemistry is a chemical bond between two chemical elements involving four bonding electrons instead of the usual two. The most common double bond, that is between two carbon atoms, can be found in alkenes. Many types of double bonds exist between two different elements. for example, in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. Other common double bonds are found in azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N) and sulfoxides (S=O). In skeletal formula the double bond is drawn as two parallel lines (=) between the two connected atoms; typographically, the equals sign is used for this.[tpl]JerryMarch[/tpl].Organic Chemistry 2nd Ed. John McMurry. Double bonds have been first introduced in chemical notation by prominent Russian chemist Alexander Butlerov.
Double bonds are stronger than single bonds and are also shorter. The bond order is two. Double bonds are also electron-rich, which makes them reactive.

[[Jet airliner]]

CATEGORIES: Airliners

A jet airliner (or jetliner, or jet) is an airliner that uses  jet engine propulsion.
Most airliners today are jet airliners because jet aircraft are capable of efficiently functioning at a high altitudes and high speeds. Historically, the airlines used the simplest turbojet engine. As time passed, turbofans became the most popular propulsion system due to lower noise and greater fuel efficiency at moderate speeds.

[[Fibonacci heap]]

CATEGORIES: Fibonacci numbers, Heaps (data structures)

In computer science, a Fibonacci heap is a heap data structure consisting of a collection of trees. It has a better amortized running time than a binomial heap. Fibonacci heaps were developed by Michael L. Fredman and Robert E. Tarjan in 1984 and first published in a scientific journal in 1987. The name of Fibonacci heap comes from Fibonacci numbers which are used in the running time analysis.
Find-minimum is O(1) amortized time.Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition. MIT Press and McGraw-Hill, 2001. ISBN 0-262-03293-7. Chapter 20: Fibonacci Heaps, pp.476–497. Third edition p518. Operations insert, decrease key, and merge (union) work in constant amortized time. Operations delete and delete minimum work in O(log n) amortized time. This means that starting from an empty data structure, any sequence of a operations from the first group and b operations from the second group would take O(a + b log n) time. In a binomial heap such a sequence of operations would take O((a + b) log (n)) time. A Fibonacci heap is thus better than a binomial heap when b is asymptotically smaller than a.
Using Fibonacci heaps for priority queues improves the asymptotic running time of important algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider (March 11, 1915 – June 26, 1990), known simply as J.C.R. or "Lick" was an American psychologist Miller, G. A. (1991), "J. C. R. Licklider, psychologist", Journal of the Acoustic Society of America 89, no. 4B, pp. 1887-1887 and computer scientist who is considered one of the most important figures in computer science and general computing history.
He is particularly remembered for being one of the first to foresee modern-style interactive computing, and its application to all manner of activities; and also as an Internet pioneer, with an early vision of a worldwide computer network long before it was built. He did much to actually initiate all that through his funding of research which led to a great deal of it, including today's canonical graphical user interface, and the ARPANET, the direct predecessor to the Internet.
He has been called "computing's Johnny Appleseed", for having planted the seeds of computing in the digital age; Robert Taylor, founder of Xerox PARC's Computer Science Laboratory and Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center, noted that "most of the significant advances in computer technology—including the work that my group did at Xerox PARC—were simply extrapolations of Lick's vision. They were not really new visions of their own. So he was really the father of it all".[tpl]cite book | last=Waldrop | first=M. Mitchell | title=The Dream Machine: J. C. R.

For people who only know today's computerized, information-rich world, the change from what came before, and thus his impact on the world (since his ideas, and the work of people he sponsored, has led, directly and indirectly, to much of it), is probably hard to truly fathom. This quotation from the full-length biography of him called The Dream Machine, gives some sense of it:

The Argonauts have faced every current western CFL team at least once in the Grey Cup, while their most celebrated divisional rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.
The football team was the property of the Argonaut Rowing Club for its first 83 years and has been owned by a series of business interests since 1956. Its current owner is David Braley. The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades, with attendance peaking in the 1970s. Recently, the team has been troubled by attendance and stadium concerns.

In British English, it would more often be called a "trust system" and should not be confused with the British honours system. 
The honor system is also a system granting freedom from customary surveillance (as to students or prisoners) with the understanding that those who are so freed will be bound by their honor to observe regulations (e.g. prison farms are operated under the honor system),"honor system." Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (24 Feb. 2008) and will therefore not abuse the trust placed in them. 
A person engaged in an honor system has a strong negative concept of breaking or going against it. The negatives may include community shame, loss of status, loss of a personal sense of integrity and pride or in extreme situations, banishment from one's community.

[[Chimney sweep]]
CATEGORIES: History of medicine, Child labour, Chimneys, Cleaning and maintenance occupations

A chimney sweep is a worker who clears ash and soot from chimneys. The chimney uses the pressure difference caused by a hot column of gas to create a draught and draw air over the hot coals or wood enabling continued combustion. Chimneys may be straight or contain many changes of direction. During normal operation, a layer of creosote builds up on the inside of the chimney restricting the flow. The creosote can also catch fire, setting the chimney and the building alight. The chimney must be swept to remove the soot. This was done by the master sweep.
In the United Kingdom, the master sweeps took apprentices, who were boys from the workhouse or bought them from their parents and trained them to climb chimneys. In the German States, master sweeps belonged to trade guilds[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=40[/tpl] and did not use climbing boys. In Italy, Belgium, and France climbing boys were used.

RDOS was capable of multitasking, with the ability to run up to 32 "tasks" (similar to threads on modern computer CPUs) simultaneously on each of two grounds (foreground and background) within a 64 KB memory space. Later versions of RDOS were compatible with Data General's 16-bit Eclipse minicomputer line.
A cut-down version of RDOS, without real-time background and foreground capability, was called Data General Diskette Operating System (DG-DOS); another related operating system was RTOS, a Real-Time Operating System for diskless environments.  RDOS on microNOVA-based "Micro Products" micro-minicomputers was sometimes called DG/RDOS.

The People's Republic of China (PRC) claims sovereignty over the territory administered by the Republic of China (ROC), claiming most of it as its Taiwan Province. The ROC also administers some offshore islands which form Fujian Province, ROC. These were part of an originally unified Fujian province, which since the stalemate of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 has been divided between the PRC and ROC.
Every province has a Communist Party of China provincial committee, headed by a secretary beside the two special administrative regions. The committee secretary is in charge of the province, rather than the governor of the provincial government.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1990 albums, 4AD albums, Albums produced by Gil Norton, Elektra Records albums, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab albums, Pixies (band) albums

Bossanova is the third studio album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in August 1990 on the English independent record label 4AD in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. All of Bossanovas original material was written by the band's frontman Black Francis; it marked the point where his artistic control over the band became absolute. The album's sound, inspired by surf and space rock, complements its lyrical focus on outer space, which references subjects such as aliens and unidentified flying objects.
Because of 4AD's independent status, major label Elektra Records handled distribution in the United States;  Bossanova reached number 70 on the Billboard 200. The album peaked at number three in the UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Bossanova, "Velouria" and "Dig for Fire"; both charted, at #4 and #11 respectively on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart.

[[Joint product pricing]]

CATEGORIES: Marketing, Pricing

In microeconomics,  joint product pricing is the firm's problem of choosing prices for joint products, which are two or more products produced from the same process or operation, each considered to be of value. Pricing for joint products is a little more complex than pricing for a single product. To begin with there are two demand curves. The characteristics of each demand curve could be different. Demand for one product could be greater than for the other product. Consumers of one product could be more price elastic than the consumers of the other product (and therefore more sensitive to changes in the product's price).
To complicate things further, both products, because they are produced jointly, share a common marginal cost curve. There are complexities in the production function also. Their production could be linked in the sense that they are bi-products (referred to as complements in production), or they could be linked in the sense that they can be produced by the same inputs (referred to as substitutes in production). Also, production of the joint product could be in fixed proportions or in variable proportions.
When setting prices in a situation as complex as this, microeconomic marginal analysis is helpful. In a simple case of a single product, price is set at that quantity demanded where marginal cost exactly equals marginal revenue. This is exactly what is done when joint products are produced in variable proportions.  Each product is treated separately. In fact, it might even be possible to construct separate cost functions. In the diagram below, to determine optimal pricing for joint products produced in variable proportions, you find the intersection point of marginal revenue (product A) with the joint marginal cost curve. You then extend that quantity, up to the demand curve for product A, and that gives you the profit maximizing price for product A (point Pa in the diagram). You do the same for product B, yielding price point Pb1.
 alt text Pricing of Joint Products 
If the products are produced in fixed proportions (example: cow hides and cow steaks), then one of the products will very likely be produced in quantities different from the profit maximizing amount considered separately. In fact the profit maximizing quantity and price of the second half of the joint product, will be different from the profit maximizing amount considered separately. In the diagram, product B is produced in greater amounts than the profit maximizing amount considered separately, and sold at a lower price (point Pb2) than the profit maximizing price considered separately (point Pb1). Although price is lower and output is higher, marginal cost is also higher. Yet this is a profit maximizing solution to this situation. Quantity supplied of product B is increased to the point that marginal revenue becomes zero (i.e.: the point where the marginal revenue curve intersects the horizontal axis).

[[Stan Marsh]]

CATEGORIES: Child characters in television, Fictional characters introduced in 1997, Fictional American people of English descent, Fictional characters from Colorado, South Park characters, Fictional characters based on real people

Stanley "Stan" Marsh is a main character in the animated television series South Park. He is voiced by and loosely based on series co-creator Trey Parker. Stan is one of the show's four central characters, along with Eric Cartman and friends Kyle Broflovski and Kenny McCormick. He debuted on television when South Park first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in The Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Parker and long-time collaborator Matt Stone in 1992 (Jesus vs. Frosty) and 1995 (Jesus vs. Santa).
Stan is a third- then fourth-grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado. Stan is generally friendly, down-to-earth, knowledgeable, helpful, laid back, and often shares with his best friend Kyle a leadership role as the main protagonist of the show. Stan is unreserved in verbally expressing his distinct lack of esteem for adults and their influences, as adult South Park residents rarely make use of their critical faculties.
Like the other South Park characters, Stan is animated by computer in a way to emulate the show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, as well as South Park-related media and merchandise. While Parker and Stone portray Stan as having common childlike tendencies, his dialogue is often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult-oriented issues, and has been frequently cited in numerous publications by experts in the fields of politics, religion, popular culture, and philosophy.

The Ninth Configuration (also known as Twinkle, Twinkle, "Killer" Kane) is a 1980 American film directed by William Peter Blatty. The film is based on Blatty's novel The Ninth Configuration (1978), which was itself a reworking of an earlier version of the novel, first published in 1966 as Twinkle, Twinkle, "Killer" Kane!. The initial 1966 publication of the novel featured an exclamation mark at the end of the title, while all subsequent publications saw it removed.
The first half of the film has the predominant tone and style of a comic farce. In the second half, the film becomes darker as it delves deeper into its central issues of human suffering, sacrifice and faith. The film also frequently blurs the line between the sane and the insane.

[[Ultramicroscope]]

CATEGORIES: Microscopes, Microscopy, Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics)

An ultramicroscope is a system of illumination for viewing tiny particles. When the diameter of a particle is below or near the wavelength of visible light (around 500 nanometers), the particle cannot be seen in a light microscope with the usual method of illumination. The ultramicroscope system is based on light scattering, not light reflection. In the system, the particles to be observed are dispersed in a liquid or gas colloid (or less often in a coarser suspension). The colloid is placed in a light-absorbing, dark enclosure, and illuminated with a convergent beam of intense light entering from one side. Light hitting the colloid particles will be scattered. In discussions about light scattering, the converging beam is called a "Tyndall cone". The scene is viewed through an ordinary microscope placed at right angles to the direction of the lightbeam. Under the microscope, the individual particles will appear as small fuzzy spots of light moving irregularly. The spots are inherently fuzzy because light scattering produces fuzzier images than light reflection. The particles are in Brownian motion in most kinds of liquid and gas colloids, which causes the movement of the spots. The ultramicroscope system can also be used to observe tiny nontransparent particles dispersed in a transparent solid or gel.
The "ultra" in "ultramicroscope" refers to the ability to see objects whose diameter is shorter than the wavelength of visible light, on the model of the "ultra" in ultraviolet.
Ultramicroscopes have been used for general observation of aerosols and colloids, and in the study of Brownian motion, and in observing ionization tracks in cloud chambers.
In 1902 the ultramicroscope was developed by Richard Adolf Zsigmondy (1865–1929) and Henry Siedentopf (1872–1940), working for Carl Zeiss AG. Applying bright sunlight for illumination they were able to determine the size of 4 nm small nanoparticles in cranberry glass. Zsigmondy further improved the ultramicroscope and presented the immersion ultramicroscope in 1912, allowing the observation of suspended nanoparticles in defined fluidic volumes. In 1925 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on colloids and the ultramicroscope.
For a different type of microscopy that also leverages light scattering against a dark background see dark field microscopy.
In the first decade of the 21st century, the illumination mode of the ultramicroscope has been extended to fluorescence measurement, as light sheet fluorescence microscopy.

The Treaty of Fredrikshamn or the Treaty of Hamina ([tpl]lang-fi|Haminan rauha[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sv|Freden i Fredrikshamn[/tpl]) was a peace treaty concluded between Sweden and Imperial Russia on 17 September 1809. The treaty concluded the Finnish War and was signed in the Finnish town of Hamina ([tpl]lang-sv|Fredrikshamn[/tpl]). Russia was represented by Nikolai Rumyantsev and David Alopaeus (Russian ambassador to Stockholm), while Sweden by Infantry General Kurt von Stedingk (former Swedish ambassador to Petersburg) and Colonel Anders Fredrik Skjöldebrand.Pokhlebkin (1995)
According to the treaty Sweden ceded parts of the provinces Lappland and Västerbotten (east of Tornio River and Muonio River), Åland, and all provinces east thereof. The ceded territories came to constitute the Grand Duchy of Finland, to which also the Russian 18th century conquests of Karelia, including small parts of Nyland and Savonia (later to be called Old Finland), were joined in 1812 as Viborg County. Together with the Diet of Porvoo (1809), and the Oath of the Sovereign http://www.histdoc.net/history/alex1.html, the Treaty of Fredrikshamn constitutes the cornerstone for the autonomous Grand Duchy, its own administration and institutions, and thereby a start of the development which would lead to the revival of Finnish culture, to equal position of the Finnish language, and ultimately in 1917 to Finland's independence.
A reference to Emperor Alexander's promise to retain old laws and privileges in Finland was included, but the treaty overstepped any formal guarantees of the legal position of Finland's inhabitants.  The Russians refused, and the Swedes were not in a position to insist.  Similar clauses had been common in peace treaties, but they were also regularly circumvented.  At the period of Russification of Finland, 90 years later, the Russian government argued that the treaty wasn't violated and hence no outside party had any right to intervene, the question being solely a matter of the emperor who had granted the original promise. 
During the negotiations, Swedish representatives had namely endeavoured to escape the loss of the Åland islands, "the fore-posts of Stockholm," as Napoleon rightly described them.  The Åland islands were culturally, ethnically and linguistically purely Swedish, but such facts were of no significance at that time.  In the course of the 19th century it would also turn out that the Åland islands were a British interest, which after the Crimean War led to the demilitarization of the islands according to the Åland Convention included in the Treaty of Paris (1856). During the Second War against Napoleon, Russia and Sweden concluded an alliance directed against Imperial France (5 April 1812). They planned to effect a landing in Swedish Pomerania, which had been overrun by the French. Russia promised to press Denmark into ceding Norway to Sweden. It was understood that Great Britain would join the treaty too, but this never came to pass. Other plans failed to materialise due to Napoleon's invasion of Russia.

The Trans-Mississippi was the geographic area west of the Mississippi River during the 19th century, containing the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Texas, and the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The term was especially used by the Confederate States of America as the designation for the theater of operations west of the Mississippi. The geographical term is generally used today only in matters relating to the study of the American Civil War.
However, the term Trans-Mississippi was also used at times to refer to any land "across the Mississippi" or the entire western two-thirds of the United States. In 1898, a Trans-Mississippi Exposition was held at Kountze Park in Omaha, Nebraska. The postage stamps of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition Issue are considered some of the most beautiful stamps ever issued by the US, and a complete set of the "Trans-Miss" is highly prized. In 1998, a set of stamps using designs derived from the original issue was issued to commemorate its 100th anniversary.

[[Neomycin]]

CATEGORIES: Aminoglycoside antibiotics, Otologicals

Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic found in many topical medications such as creams, ointments, and eyedrops. The discovery of neomycin dates back to 1949. It was discovered in the lab of Selman Waksman, who was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and medicine in 1951. Neomycin belongs to aminoglycoside class of antibiotics that contain two or more aminosugars connected by glycosidic bonds. Due to the inherent oto- and nephrotoxicity of these substances, systemic use has declined, as safer alternatives have become available.

Summerhill School is an independent British boarding school that was founded in 1921 by Alexander Sutherland Neill with the belief that the school should be made to fit the child, rather than the other way around. It is run as a democratic community; the running of the school is conducted in the school meetings, which anyone, staff or pupil, may attend, and at which everyone has an equal vote. These meetings serve as both a legislative and judicial body. Members of the community are free to do as they please, so long as their actions do not cause any harm to others, according to Neill's principle "Freedom, not Licence." This extends to the freedom for pupils to choose which lessons, if any, they attend.

[[Public space]]

CATEGORIES: Community building

A public space is a social space that is generally open and accessible to people. Roads (including the pavement), public squares, parks and beaches are typically considered public space. Government buildings which are open to the public, such as public libraries are public space. Although not considered public space, privately owned buildings or property visible from sidewalks and public thoroughfares may affect the public visual landscape, for example, by outdoor advertising. Recently, the concept of Shared space has been advanced to enhance the experience of pedestrians in public space jointly used by automobiles and other vehicles.
Public space has also become something of a touchstone for critical theory in relation to philosophy, (urban) geography, visual art, cultural studies, social studies and urban design. The term 'public space' is also often misconstrued to mean other things such as 'gathering place', which is an element of the larger concept of social space.
One of the earliest examples of public spaces are commons. For example, no fees or paid tickets are required for entry. Non-government-owned malls are examples of 'private space' with the appearance of being 'public space'.

Wiley College is a four-year, private, historically black, liberal arts college located on the west side of Marshall, in the U.S. state of Texas. Founded in 1873 by the Methodist Episcopal Church's Bishop Isaac Wiley and certified in 1882 by the Freedman's Aid Society, it is notable as one of the oldest predominantly black colleges west of the Mississippi River.http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aaw/wiley-college-1873http://www.wileyc.edu/history.asp
In 2005–2006, on-campus enrollment approached 450, while an off-campus program in Shreveport, Louisiana, for students with some prior college credits who seek to finish a degree, enrolled about 250. As of the fall of 2006, total enrollment was about 750. By fall of 2013, total enrollment was approximately 1400. Wiley is an open admissions college and about 96 percent of students receive some financial aid.http://www.wiley.edu
The Wiley staff learned that over a 15-year period, Melvin B. Tolson’s debate teams lost only one of 75 debates. The Wiley Forensic Society competed against historically black colleges, but earned national attention with its debates against the University of Southern California and Harvard University.

The CAMiLEON (Creative Archiving at Michigan & Leeds) project was a joint undertaking by the University of Michigan and the University of Leeds to develop and evaluate a range of technical strategies for the long term  preservation of digital material suffering from digital obsolescence.  The project was funded jointly by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the US National Science Foundation over a 3-4 year period from 1 October 1999. The UK component of the project was completed on 31 December 2002, the US component finished on 30 September 2003.
The project's first case study was the multimedia BBC Domesday Project created by the BBC between 1984 and 1986.  The BBC published this work on LaserDiscs in LaserVision Read Only Memory (LV-ROM) format, which can now be read only by a few machines, and there were fears that the data would become unreadable.

[[Mathematical fallacy]]

CATEGORIES: Proof theory, Mathematical proofs, Logical fallacies, Humour

In mathematics, certain kinds of mistaken proof are often exhibited, and sometimes collected, as illustrations of a concept of mathematical fallacy. There is a distinction between a simple mistake and a mathematical fallacy in a proof: a mistake in a proof leads to an invalid proof just in the same way, but in the best-known examples of mathematical fallacies, there is some concealment in the presentation of the proof. For example, the reason validity fails may be a division by zero that is hidden by algebraic notation. There is a striking quality of the mathematical fallacy: as typically presented, it leads not only to an absurd result, but does so in a crafty or clever way.[tpl]harvnb|Maxwell|1959|p=9[/tpl]  Therefore these fallacies, for pedagogic reasons, usually take the form of spurious proofs of obvious contradictions. Although the proofs are flawed, the errors, usually by design, are comparatively subtle, or designed to show that certain steps are conditional, and should not be applied in the cases that are the exceptions to the rules.
The traditional way of presenting a mathematical fallacy is to give an invalid step of deduction mixed in with valid steps, so that the meaning of fallacy is here slightly different from the logical fallacy. The latter applies normally to a form of argument that is not a genuine rule of logic, where the problematic mathematical step is typically a correct rule applied with a tacit wrong assumption. Beyond pedagogy, the resolution of a fallacy can lead to deeper insights into a subject (such as the introduction of Pasch's axiom of Euclidean geometry).[tpl]harvnb|Maxwell|1959[/tpl]  Pseudaria, an ancient lost book of false proofs, is attributed to Euclid.[tpl]harvnb|Heath|Helberg|1908|loc=Chapter II, §I[/tpl]
Mathematical fallacies exist in many branches of mathematics.  In elementary algebra, typical examples may involve a step where division by zero is performed, where a root is incorrectly extracted or, more generally, where different values of a multiple valued function are equated.  Well-known fallacies also exist in elementary Euclidean geometry and calculus.

With Napoleon's European conquests, her court, then under the direction of Prince Dom João, the Prince Regent, moved to the then Portuguese colony of Brazil. Later on, Brazil would be elevated from the rank of a colony to that of a Kingdom, the Kingdom of Brazil, with the consequential formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.

Following his exile as a result of his actions in the Abrilada, Miguel returned to Portugal as regent to his niece Queen Maria II of Portugal, and potential royal consort. As regent, he claimed the Portuguese throne in his own right, since according to the so-called Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom his older brother Pedro IV and therefore the latter's daughter had lost their rights from the moment that Pedro had made war on Portugal and become the sovereign of a foreign state (Brazilian Empire). This led to a difficult political situation, during which many people were killed, imprisoned, persecuted or sent into exile, and which culminated in the Portuguese Liberal Wars between authoritarian absolutists and progressive constitutionalists. In the end Miguel was forced from the throne and lived the last 32 years of his life in exile.

[[Jäger (military)]]
CATEGORIES: Infantry, Combat occupations, 18th- and 19th-century warrior types, German words and phrases

Jäger (singular der Jäger, plural die Jäger, [tpl]IPA-de|ˈjɛːɡɐ[/tpl]) is a German military term adopted in 1631 by the landgrave of Hesse when he first formed an elite infantry unit out of his professional hunters (Jäger) and rangers (Forstleute) in the Hessian Army.
During the Age of Enlightenment in German-speaking states (and others influenced by them) Jäger is used to describe elite light infantry,[tpl]cite book|title=The Evolution Of Operational Art, 1740-1813|author=Claus Telp|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7146-5722-0[/tpl] especially skirmishers, scouts, sharpshooters and couriers. Jäger, which means "hunter" or "huntsman" in German, came by extension to denote light infantrymen whose forester background made them suitable for skirmishing as individuals rather than as a drilled and regimented body of soldiers. Often they came from families with a tradition of service to one feudal lord. Initially Jägers made use of their own precision made rifles: a more accurate weapon with a longer range than the muskets used by line troops.
While Jäger term continue, in some modern instances, to carry their original and literal connotations, both have broadened in usage over time. For instance, Feldjäger  was the name given by the Prussian Army basically for scouts and couriers. In Bundeswehr Feldjäger is the name of German military police. During the 20th century Jagdflugzeug (short form: Jäger) became the German word for fighter aircraft, while Panzerjäger was the name adopted for tank destroyers.
Jäger, in its original sense of light infantry, is usually translated into English as:
In English Jäger is often written as jaeger (both pl. and sgl.) or anglicised as jager (pl. jagers) to avoid the umlaut.

[[Lexical functional grammar]]

CATEGORIES: Generative linguistics, Grammar frameworks

Lexical functional grammar (LFG) is a grammar framework in theoretical linguistics, a variety of generative grammar. It is a type of phrase structure grammar, as opposed to a dependency grammar. The development of the theory was initiated by Joan Bresnan and Ronald Kaplan in the 1970s, in reaction to the direction research in the area of transformational grammar had begun to take. It mainly focuses on syntax, including its relation with morphology and semantics. There has been little LFG work on phonology (although ideas from optimality theory have recently been popular in LFG research).
LFG views language as being made up of multiple dimensions of structure. Each of these dimensions is represented as a distinct structure with its own rules, concepts, and form. The primary structures that have figured in LFG research are:
For example, in the sentence The old woman eats the falafel, the c-structure analysis is that this is a sentence which is made up of two pieces, a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP). The VP is itself made up of two pieces, a verb (V) and another NP. The NPs are also analyzed into their parts. Finally, the bottom of the structure is composed of the words out of which the sentence is constructed. The f-structure analysis, on the other hand, treats the sentence as being composed of attributes, which include features such as number and tense or functional units such as subject, predicate, or object.
There are other structures which are hypothesized in LFG work:
The various structures can be said to be mutually constraining.
The LFG conception of language differs from Chomskyan theories, which have always involved separate levels of constituent structure representation being mapped onto each other sequentially, via transformations. The LFG approach has had particular success with nonconfigurational languages, languages in which the relation between structure and function is less direct than it is in languages like English; for this reason LFG's adherents consider it a more plausible universal model of language.
Another feature of LFG is that grammatical-function changing operations like passivization are said to be lexical. This means that the active-passive relation, for example, is a relation between two types of verb rather than two trees. Active and passive verbs are both listed in the lexicon, and involve alternative mapping of the participants to grammatical functions.
Through the positing of productive processes in the lexicon and the separation of structure and function, LFG is able to account for syntactic patterns without the use of transformations defined over syntactic structure. For example, in a sentence like What did you see?, where what is understood as the object of see, transformational grammar puts what after see (the usual position for objects) in "deep structure", and then moves it. LFG analyzes what as having two functions: question-focus and object. It occupies the position associated in English with the question-focus function, and the constraints of the language allow it to take on the object function as well.
A central goal in LFG research is to create a model of grammar with a depth which appeals to linguists while at the same time being efficiently parsable and having the rigidity of formalism which computational linguists require. Because of this, computational parsers have been developed and LFG has also been used as the theoretical basis of various machine translation tools, such as AppTek's TranSphere, and the Julietta Research Group's Lekta.

Luís I ([tpl]IPA-pt|luˈiʃ[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-en|Louis I[/tpl], Full name: Luís Filipe Maria Fernando Pedro de Alcântara António Miguel Rafael Gabriel Gonzaga Xavier Francisco de Assis João Augusto Júlio Valfando de Saxe-Coburgo-Gotha e Bragança, the Popular, Port. o Popular; Lisbon, 31 October 1838 – 19 October 1889 in Cascais) was the King of Portugal and the Algarves between 1861 and 1889. He was the second son of Maria II and Ferdinand II and was created Duke of Porto and Viseu.
Luís was a cultured man who wrote vernacular poetry, but had no distinguishing gifts in the political field into which he was thrust by the deaths of his brothers Pedro V and Fernando in 1861. Luís's domestic reign was a tedious and ineffective series of transitional governments called Rotativism formed at various times by the Progressistas (Liberals) and the Regeneradores (Conservatives – the party generally favoured by King Luís, who secured their long term in office after 1881).  Despite a flirtation with the Spanish succession prior to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Luís's reign was otherwise one of domestic stagnation as Portugal fell ever further behind the nations of western Europe in terms of public education, political stability, technological progress and economic prosperity.  In colonial affairs, Delagoa Bay was confirmed as a Portuguese possession in 1875, whilst Belgian activities in the Congo (1880s) and a British Ultimatum in 1890 denied Portugal a land link between Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique at the peak of the Scramble for Africa.
Luís was mostly a man of the sciences, with a passion for oceanography. He invested great amounts of his fortune in funding research boats to collect specimens in the oceans of the world. He was responsible for the establishment of one of the World's first Aquariums, Aquário Vasco da Gama in Lisbon, which is still open to the public with its vast collection of maritime life forms, including a 10 meter long squid. His love for sciences and things new was passed to his two sons.

The Minneapolis Millers were an American professional minor league baseball team that played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, until 1960. In the 19th century a different Minneapolis Millers were part of the Western League. The team played first in Athletic Park and later Nicollet Park. 
The name Minneapolis Millers has been associated with a variety of professional minor league teams. The original Millers date back to 1884 when the Northwestern League was formed. This league failed and the Western League replaced it, absorbing some of the old teams. According to Stew Thornley, this team folded in 1891 due to financial problems. In 1894, another team calling itself the Millers was formed when Ban Johnson and Charles Comiskey revived the Western League in hopes of making it a second major league. The Millers continued to play in the Western League through 1900, when the name was changed to the American League to give it more of a national image. Following the 1900 season, several cities were abandoned for bigger markets in cities recently vacated by the National League, including Minneapolis. Some teams were transferred, as was the case of the Kansas City franchise to become the Washington Nationals (Senators). However, some of the teams were just left out in the dark. It is unclear which of these two paths the Millers took, but most evidence seems to point toward abandonment, not a transfer to Baltimore. The best way to investigate this would be to look at old rosters and compare them from year to year.
Several teams went by the nickname Millers, but the most prominent of these was the team in the American Association. The Millers won four Association pennants during the 1910–23 tenure of "Pongo Joe" Cantillon, then were managed from 1924–31 by another legend, Michael Joseph Kelley, one of the great figures of American Association history. Kelley operated the team as club president until 1946.  Broadcaster Halsey Hall was the Millers' play-by-play man from 1933 until the club folded in 1960 to make way for the Minnesota Twins.
Ted Williams, Willie Mays and Carl Yastrzemski were among some future major leaguers who played for the Millers. The Millers won nine pennants in the Association from 1902 to 1960. They played their home games at Nicollet Park until 1955, the ballfeld being demolished the following year. That site, at 31st and Nicollet Avenue, is now the home of a bank. In 1956 they moved into Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota, until 1960. They had a heated crosstown rivalry with the St. Paul Saints.
Over the years the Millers were participants in four Junior World Series; matchups between the champions of the American Association and the International League. In the 1932 championship, the team was defeated by the Newark Bears 4 games to 2. The Millers, under manager Bill Rigney clinched the 1955 series against the Rochester Red Wings, 4 games to 3, in the final ball game played at Nicollet Park. In 1958, the Millers, with Gene Mauch as manager, beat the Montreal Royals 4 games to 0.  Their last appearance in this Series was in 1959, with Mauch as manager, when the Millers lost the series 4 games to 3 to the Havana Sugar Kings.
After the farm system era began, the Millers were top-level affiliates of the Boston Red Sox (1936–38; 1958–60) and New York Giants (1946–57). The Red Sox actually swapped ownership of their top farm club, the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, for the Millers in 1957, enabling the Giants to move to San Francisco.
The Millers folded after the 1960 season with the arrival of the Minnesota Twins in 1961. The Red Sox moved the triple A team to the Pacific Coast League where it became the Seattle Rainiers.

[[Hardhead]]

CATEGORIES: Ducks, Aythya, Birds of South Australia, Birds of Tasmania, Birds of Western Australia, Birds of Indonesia

The Hardhead (Aythya australis) (also White-eyed Duck) is the only true diving duck found in Australia. Hardheads are common in the south-east of Australia, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin, but also in the wetter country near the coasts. They are moderately nomadic in normal years, but disperse widely in times of drought. Significant numbers reach as far afield as New Guinea, New Zealand, and the islands of the Pacific, where they can remain for some time, even breeding for a season or two.
Like the other members of the pochard group, Hardheads feed by diving deeply, often staying submerged for as long as a minute at a time. They slip under the water with barely a ripple, simply lowering their heads and thrusting with their powerful webbed feet. They eat a broad range of small aquatic creatures, and supplement this with water weeds.
Hardheads prefer larger lakes, swamps and rivers with deep, still water, but are often seen in smaller streams, flooded grasslands, and shallow pools. As a general rule, they avoid coastal waters. They rarely come to land and never perch in trees.
Hardheads are small by duck standards, usually not much more than 45 cm long but reaching 60 cm sometimes, and noticeably more rounded in overall form than most ducks. Both male and female are a fairly uniform chocolate-brown above, with rufous flanks and white undersides (which are often not visible if the duck is in the water). The trailing edges and almost the entire underside of the wings are white. In the male, the eyes are a striking white, in the female, brown.
Widespread throughout its large range, the Hardhead is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

[[Commander-in-chief]]

CATEGORIES: Commanders in chief, Military organization, Military sociology, Military ranks

A commander-in-chief is the person or body exercising supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element may be defined as those forces within a particular region or those forces which are associated by function. As a practical term it refers to the military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadership; either a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet or some other collegial body.
Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran; following the principle of civilian control of the military.
The role of commander-in-chief derives from the Latin, imperator. Imperatores of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire possessed imperium (command) powers. In its modern usage, the term was first used by King Charles I of England in 1639. A nation's head of state (monarchical or republican) usually holds the nominal position of commander-in-chief, even if effective executive power is held by a separate head of government. In a parliamentary system, the executive branch is ultimately dependent upon the will of the legislature; although the legislature does not issue orders directly to the armed forces and therefore does not control the military in any operational sense. Governors-general and colonial governors are also often appointed commander-in-chief of the military forces within their territory.
A commander-in-chief is sometimes referred to as Supreme Commander, which is sometimes used as a specific term. The term is also used for military officers who hold such power and authority, not always through dictatorship, and as a subordinate (usually) to a head of state (see Generalissimo). The term is also used for officers that hold authority over individual branches or within a theatre of operationsDupuy, Trevor N., Curt Johnson, and Grace P. Hayes. "Supreme Commander."

[[Protoplasm]]
CATEGORIES: Cell biology

Protoplasm is the living contents of a cell that is surrounded by a plasma membrane. It is a general term for the cytoplasm.[tpl]Citation |author=Cammack, Richard; Teresa Atwood; Attwood, Teresa K.; Campbell, Peter Scott; Parish, Howard I.; Smith, Tony; Vella, Frank; Stirling, John |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford Oxfordshire |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-852917-1[/tpl] Protoplasm is composed of a mixture of small molecules such as ions, amino acids, monosaccharides and water, and macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and polysaccharides.[tpl]Citation|title=Textbook of Medical Physiology, Eleventh Edition|author=Arthur C. Guyton, John E. Hall|quote=Protoplasm is composed mainly of five basic substances: water, electrolytes, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.|publisher=Saunders[/tpl] In eukaryotes the protoplasm surrounding the cell nucleus is known as the cytoplasm and that inside the nucleus as the nucleoplasm. In prokaryotes the material inside the plasma membrane is the bacterial cytoplasm, while in Gram-negative bacteria the region outside the plasma membrane but inside the outer membrane is the periplasm.
The word "protoplasm" comes from the Greek protos for first, and plasma for thing formed. It was first used in 1846 by Hugo von Mohl to describe the "tough, slimy, granular, semi-fluid" substance within plant cells, to distinguish this from the cell wall, cell nucleus and the cell sap within the vacuole.Protoplasm. Later J. E. Purkinje coined the term for Cytoplasm + Nucleoplasm in animal cell. 1911 Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Thomas Huxley later referred to it as the "physical basis of life" and considered that the property of life resulted from the distribution of molecules within this substance. Its composition, however, was mysterious and there was much controversy over what sort of substance it was.[tpl]citation | author = Harvey, E.

The idea that protoplasm of eukaryotes is divisible into a ground substance called "cytoplasm" and a structural body called the cell nucleus reflects the more primitive knowledge of cell structure that preceded the development of electron microscopy, when it seemed that cytoplasm was a homogeneous fluid and the existence of most sub-cellular compartments, or how cells maintain their shape, was unknown.[tpl]citation | author = Satir, P. | year = 2005 | title = Tour of organelles through the electron microscope: A reprinting of Keith R.

Protoplasm can exist in two forms: a liquid-like sol state or a jelly-like gel state. Whether protoplasm is in the sol or the gel state depends on the physiological state of the cell.

[[Convergent boundary]]
CATEGORIES: Plate tectonics

In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming  region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide.  As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved.  In a subduction zone, the subducting plate, which is normally a plate with oceanic crust, moves beneath the other plate, which can be made of either oceanic or continental crust.  During collisions between two continental plates, large mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas are formed.

[[Planetary differentiation]]

CATEGORIES: Planetary science

In planetary science, planetary differentiation is the process of separating out different constituents of a planetary body as a consequence of their physical or chemical behaviour, where the body develops into compositionally distinct layers; the denser materials of a planet sink to the center, while less dense materials rise to the surface. Such a process tends to create a core and mantle. Sometimes a chemically distinct crust forms on top of the mantle. The process of planetary differentiation has occurred on planets, dwarf planets, the asteroid 4 Vesta, and natural satellites (such as the Moon).

[[A News]]
CATEGORIES: Usenet, Usenet servers

A News, originally known simply as "news," was the first widely distributed program for serving and reading Usenet newsgroups.  The program, written at Duke University by Steve Daniel and Tom Truscott, was released on a tape given out at the June 1980 USENIX conference held at the University of Delaware.  Steve Daniel from Duke offered a presentation on the then-new Usenet network and invited attendees to join.
The Seventh Edition of Unix included a "message of the day" facility, which allowed the system operator to cause messages to be displayed to the user at login.  A News (so called because each message began with "A" as a marker character) was an expansion of this facility that allowed news messages to be distributred across an arbitrary number of systems using the new uucp service.
In addition to the login display, news articles could be read at any time from the command line.  A user could also post new messages to the local machine (by posting to a special default newsgroup called "general") or queue it for network-wide transmission by placing it in a public group such as "NET.general".
The software was designed primarily for announcements, so the interface was extremely simple.  There were no provisions built in for replying to articles over news (e-mail replies were supported), skipping over messages, or threading.  Because the system was designed only with uucp in mind, posters were identified by their uucp "bang path" addresses, a feature that persists (albeit more for identifying servers than users) in modern Usenet.  ARPAnet addressing was not supported.
The message format was designed for compactness rather than flexibility, consistent with the slow dialup modems used in 1980. The initial "A" dictated the layout of header and message information, and expansions would require changing the initial character.  This scheme was abandoned after A news for the more verbose but expandable format seen [tpl]As of|2009|alt=today[/tpl].
Because Usenet grew rapidly, the limited capabilities and simplistic article storage scheme (all articles were placed in a single disk directory and there was no facility for expiring old articles) quickly made A News impractical to use.  It was largely superseded by B News, although some organizations continued to use it for internal communications for many years. Later modifications did add the ability to process the early B News article format and act on B News control articles.

Over the course of three acts, the inhabitants of a small, provincial French town turn into rhinoceroses; ultimately the only human who does not succumb to this mass metamorphosis is the central character, Bérenger, a flustered everyman figure who is criticized throughout the play for his drinking and tardiness.  The play is often read as a response and criticism to the sudden upsurge of Communism, Fascism and Nazism during the events preceding World War II, and explores the themes of conformity, culture, mass movements, philosophy and morality.

Percy Aldridge Grainger (8 July 1882[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]20 February 1961) was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist. In the course of a long and innovative career he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. He also made many adaptations of other composers' works. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune "Country Gardens".
Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters.
In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the US Army during 1917–18, and took US citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922 he became increasingly involved in educational work.  He also experimented with music machines that he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works and as a future research archive. As he grew older he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity, and he considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year before his death.

"Bluebeard" (French: La Barbe bleue) is a French literary folktale, the most famous surviving version of which was written by  Charles Perrault and first published by Barbin in Paris in January 1697 in Histoires ou Contes du temps passé.  The tale tells the story of a violent nobleman in the habit of murdering his wives and the attempts of one wife to avoid the fate of her predecessors.  Gilles de Rais, a 15th-century aristocrat and prolific serial killer, has been suggested as the source for the character of Bluebeard, as has Conomor the Accursed, an early Breton king. "The White Dove", "Mister Fox" and "Fitcher's Bird" are tales similar to "Bluebeard".

The American School of Quito opened its doors on October 14, 1940 to 162 students. The first directors were Robert E. and Mrs. Hazel J. Tucker, who had just arrived from the United States. The founders of the school lived in a time characterized by the fascist movements in Europe, represented in Ecuador and other South American nations by the German and Italian schools operating there. The two founders wanted to counter this. They had a vision of educating the youth of Ecuador in democratic values knowing these students would become the future leaders.
Th American School has 2,116 students from Pre-Kindergarten to Twelfth Grade. Among these students are the children and grandchildren of founding families. The school is co-educational, non-religious and is a non-profit foundation. It is accredited by AdvancED and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Education and Culture.

[[Cathodic protection]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical processes, Corrosion prevention, Hydrogen technologies

Cathodic Protection (CP) is a technique used to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell.Peabody p.6 A simple method of protection connects protected metal to a more easily corroded "sacrificial metal" to act as the anode.  The sacrificial metal then corrodes instead of the protected metal.   For structures such as long pipelines,  where passive galvanic cathodic protection is not adequate, an external DC electrical power source is used to provide sufficient current.
Cathodic protection systems protect a wide range of metallic structures in various environments. Common applications are; steel water or fuel pipelines and storage tanks such as home water heaters, steel pier piles; ship and boat hulls; offshore oil platforms and onshore oil well casings and metal reinforcement bars in concrete buildings and structures.  Another common application is in galvanized steel, in which a sacrificial coating of zinc on steel parts protects them from rust.
Cathodic protection can, in some cases, prevent stress corrosion cracking.

CATEGORIES: Japanese words and phrases, Anime and manga terminology, Seinen manga

[tpl]Nihongo|''Seinen'' manga|青年漫画[/tpl] is a subset of manga that is generally targeted at men from ages 17 on into their 40's. In Japanese, the word seinen means "young man" or "young men."  Seinen manga are distinguished from the more sex-focused seijin-muke manga (成人向け漫画 often classed in western fandom as 'hentai') although there is sexual content of a softcore nature in some of the seinen strips.  The female equivalent to seinen manga is josei manga. 
Seinen manga have a wide variety of art styles and variation in subject matter, ranging from the avant-garde through sports, games, business or action/adventure on to the erotic.  Examples of seinen strips include: Akira,  Berserk,  Battle Royale,   Ghost in the Shell, Hellsing,   Battle Angel Alita and Maison Ikkoku.
A common way to tell if a manga is seinen is by looking at whether or not furigana is used over the original kanji text: if there are furigana on all kanji, the title is generally aimed at a younger audience. The title of the magazine it was published in is also an important indicator. Usually Japanese manga magazines with the word "young" in the title (Weekly Young Jump for instance) are seinen. There are also mix shōnen/seinen magazines like Champion Red, Gangan Powered and Comp Ace. Other popular seinen manga magazines include Young Magazine, Weekly Young Sunday, Big Comic Spirits, Business Jump, Ultra Jump, and Afternoon.

[[Transfer pricing]]
CATEGORIES: Pricing, Competition (economics), Marketing, International taxation, Tax avoidance

Transfer pricing is a profit allocation method used to attribute a multinational corporation's net profit (or loss) before tax to countries where it does business. Transfer pricing results in the setting of prices among divisions within an enterprise. Transfer prices are charges for goods and services between controlled (or related) legal entities within an enterprise. Legal entities considered under the control of a single corporation include branches and companies that are wholly or majority owned ultimately by the parent corporation. Certain jurisdictions consider entities to be under common control if they share family members on their boards of directors.
In principle a transfer price should match either what the seller would charge an independent, arm's length customer, or what the buyer would pay an independent, arm's length supplier.  While unrealistic transfer prices do not affect the overall enterprise directly, they become a concern when they are misused to lower profits in a division of an enterprise that is located in a country that levies high taxes and raise profits in a country that is a  tax haven that levies no or low taxes.Gio Wiederhold (2013): Valuing Intellectual Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens; Springer Verlag, August 2013.

[[Shtick]]

CATEGORIES: Comedy, Yiddish words and phrases, Jewish comedy and humor

A shtick ([tpl]lang-yi|שטיק[/tpl]) (or schtick) is a comic theme or gimmick. "Shtick" is derived from the Yiddish word shtik (שטיק), meaning "piece"; the closely related German word Stück has the same meaning.  The English word "piece" itself is also sometimes used in a similar context. Another variant is "bits of business" or just "bits"; comic mannerisms such as Laurel and Hardy's fiddling with their ties, or one of them looking into the camera shaking his head while the other one would ramble on. A shtick can also refer to an adopted persona, usually for comedy performances, that is maintained consistently (though not necessarily exclusively) across the performer's career. In this usage, the recurring personalities adopted by Laurel and Hardy through all of their many comedy films (despite the fact that they often played characters with different names and professions) would qualify as their shtick. A comedian might maintain several different shticks of this sort, particularly if they appear in a variety show that encourages them to develop multiple characters, such as Saturday Night Live.
In common usage, the word shtick has also come to mean any talent, style, habit, or other eccentricity for which a person is particularly well-known, even if not intended for comedic purposes. For example, a person who is known locally for his or her ability to eat dozens of hot dogs quickly might say that it was their shtick.
Among Orthodox Jews, "shtick" can also refer to wedding shtick, in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom through dancing, costumes, juggling, and silliness.

The communal response of the first generation of Jews after the Exile had set the tone for centuries to come. Out of exile and diaspora had come at least two segments of the Hebrew Bible as we know it, Torah and Prophets, which were redacted no later than the end of the Persian period (circa 400 BCE); the third section of the Bible (the "Hagiographa") was available by this time as well.

[[Left atrium]]

CATEGORIES: Cardiac anatomy

The left atrium is one of four chambers in the human heart. It receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins, and pumps it into the left ventricle, via the mitral valve.  Atria facilitate circulation primarily by allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart, preventing the inertia of interrupted venous flow that would otherwise occur at each ventricular systole.Anderson, RM.

[[Right atrium]]

CATEGORIES: Cardiac anatomy

The right atrium (in older texts termed the "right auricle", which now means the right atrial appendage) is one of four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) in the hearts of mammals (including humans) and archosaurs (which include birds and crocodilians). It receives deoxygenated blood from the superior and inferior venae cavae, the coronary sinus, and the anterior and smallest cardiac veins, and pumps it into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. Attached to the right atrium is the right auricular appendix.

Dame Nellie Melba GBE (19 May 1861[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]23 February 1931), born Helen "Nellie" Porter Mitchell, was an Australian operatic soprano. She became one of the most famous singers of the late Victorian Era and the early 20th century.  She was the first Australian to achieve international recognition as a classical musician.
Melba studied singing in Melbourne and made a modest success in performances there. After a brief and unsuccessful marriage, she moved to Europe in search of a singing career.  Failing to find engagements in London in 1886, she studied in Paris and soon made a great success there and in Brussels. Returning to London she quickly established herself as the leading lyric soprano at Covent Garden from 1888. She soon achieved further success in Paris and elsewhere in Europe, and later at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, debuting there in 1893. Her repertoire was small; in her whole career she sang no more than 25 roles and was closely identified with only ten. She was known for her performances in French and Italian opera, but sang little German opera.
During the First World War, Melba raised large sums for war charities. She returned to Australia frequently during the 20th century, singing in opera and concerts, and had a house built for her near Melbourne. She was active in the teaching of singing at the Melbourne Conservatorium.  Melba continued to sing until the last months of her life and made a legendary number of "farewell" appearances. Her death, in Australia, was news across the English-speaking world, and her funeral was a major national event.

[[Alkoxy group]]

CATEGORIES: Alkoxy groups

In chemistry, the alkoxy group is an alkyl (carbon and hydrogen chain) group singular bonded to oxygen thus: R—O.  The range of alkoxy groups is great, the simplest being methoxy (CH3O—). An ethoxy group (CH3CH2O—) is found in the organic compound ethyl phenyl ether, C6H5OCH2CH3 which is also known as ethoxybenzene. Related to alkoxy groups are aryloxy groups, which have an aryl group singular bonded to oxygen such as the phenoxy group (C6H5O—).
An alkoxy or aryloxy group bonded to an alkyl or aryl (R1—O—R2) is an ether. If bonded to H it is an alcohol. An alkoxide (RO–) is the ionic or salt form; it is a derivative of an alcohol where the proton has been replaced by a metal, typically sodium.

Hustler is a monthly pornographic magazine published in the United States. It was first published in 1974 by Larry Flynt. It was a step forward from the Hustler Newsletter, which was cheap advertising for his strip club businesses at the time. The magazine grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around 3 million; it has since dropped to approximately 500,000. It shows explicit views of the female genitalia, becoming one of the first major US-based magazines to do so, in contrast with relatively modest publications like Playboy.Kipnis (2001) pp.134-135
Today, Hustler is still considered more explicit (and more self-consciously lowbrow) than such well-known competitors as Playboy and Penthouse. It frequently depicts hardcore themes, such as the use of sex toys, penetration and group sex.
Larry Flynt Publications also licenses Hustler brand to the Hustler Casino in Gardena, California which is owned directly by Larry Flynt as an individual through his holding company El Dorado Enterprises, the Hustler Club chain of bars and clubs, and Hustler store chain that sells adult-oriented videos, cIothing, magazines and sex toys.

[[Missus dominicus]]

CATEGORIES: Holy Roman Empire, Counts

A missus dominicus (plural missi dominici), Latin for "envoys of the lord ruler", also known in Dutch as Zendgraaf (German: Sendgraf), meaning "sent Graf", was an official commissioned by the Frankish king or Holy Roman Emperor to supervise the administration, mainly of justice, in parts of his dominions too far for frequent personal visits. As such, the missus performed important intermediary functions between royal and local administrations. There are superficial points of comparison with the original Roman corrector, except that the missus was sent out on a regular basis. Four points made the missi effective as instruments of the centralized monarchy: the personal character of the missus, yearly change, isolation from local interests and the free choice of the king.Points noted in James Laurence Laughlin, "The decline of the missi dominici in Frankish Gaul", Credit 4.1 (1903:1-22) p. 5.

Karelian language (karjala, karjal or kariela) is a Finnic language spoken mainly in the Russian Republic of Karelia. Linguistically Karelian is closely related to the Finnish dialects spoken in eastern Finland and some Finnish linguists even classified Karelian as a dialect of Finnish. Karelian is not to be confused with the Southeastern dialects of Finnish, sometimes referred to as karjalaismurteet ('Karelian dialects') in Finland.
There is no standard Karelian language so each writer writes in Karelian according to his own dialectal form. Written forms have been developed for North Karelian; Olonets Karelian; Tver Karelian, and Lude. All variants, except the Tver Karelian, are written with the Latin script based Karelian alphabet, though the Cyrillic script has been used in the past.

[[Quintus Fufius Calenus]]

CATEGORIES: 40 BC deaths, Ancient Roman generals, Roman Republican consuls, Fufii, 1st-century BC Romans, Year of birth unknown

Quintus Fufius Calenus (died 40 BC) was a Roman general, and consul in 47 BC.
As tribune of the people in 61 BC, he was chiefly instrumental in securing the acquittal of the notorious Publius Clodius when charged with having profaned the mysteries of Bona Dea (Cicero, Ad. Att. 1.16). In 59 BC Calenus was praetor, and brought forward a law that the senators, knights, and tribuni aerarii, who composed the judices, should vote separately, so that it might be known how they gave their votes (Cassius Dio xxxviii. 8). He fought in Gaul (51 BC) and Spain (49 BC) under Julius Caesar, who, after he had crossed over to Greece (48 BC), sent Calenus from Epirus to bring over the rest of the troops from Italy. On the passage to Italy, most of the ships were captured by Bibulus and Calenus himself escaped with difficulty. In 47 BC, he was raised to the consulship through the influence of Caesar. After the death of the dictator, he joined Mark Antony, for whom he commanded eleven legions in the north of Italy. Calenus died in 40 BC, while stationed with his army at the foot of the Alps, just as he was on the point of marching against Octavian; but Calenus' son handed over the legions to the future emperor.

CATEGORIES: Veps language, Finnic languages, Languages of Russia, Republic of Karelia

The Veps language (also known as Vepsian, natively as vepsän kel’, vepsän keli, or vepsä), spoken by the Vepsians (also known as Veps), belongs to the Finnic group of the Uralic languages.  Closely related to Finnish and Karelian, Veps is also written using Latin script.
According to Soviet statistics, 12,500 people were self-designated ethnic Veps at the end of 1989.
According to the location of the people, the language is divided into three main dialects: Northern Veps (at Lake Onega to the south of Petrozavodsk, to the north of the river Svir, including the former Veps National Volost), Central Veps (in the Saint Petersburg region and Vologda Oblast), and Southern Veps (in the Saint Petersburg region). The Northern dialect seems the most distinct of the three; however, it is still possible for speakers of one dialect group to understand those of another. Speakers of the Northern dialect call themselves "Ludi" (lüdikad), or lüdilaižed.
In Russia, more than 350 children learn the Vepsian language in a total of 5 national schools.http://gov.karelia.ru/News/2004/12/1209_03_e.html

When this happens, the number of extra lives obtained sometimes changes the notification from "1-up" to the number that reflects the total lives earned: Two lives would be "2-up", five lives would be "5-up", and so on. Games that don't do it this way often simply repeat the "1-up" notification in rapid succession concurrent with the number of lives awarded.

Cold Comfort Farm is a comic novel by English author Stella Gibbons, published in 1932. It parodies the romanticised, sometimes doom-laden accounts of rural life popular at the time, by writers such as Mary Webb. Gibbons was working for the Evening Standard in 1928 when they decided to serialise Webb's first novel, The Golden Arrow, and Gibbons was given the job of summarising the plot of earlier instalments. Other novelists in the tradition parodied by Cold Comfort Farm are D. H. Lawrence, Sheila Kaye-Smith and Thomas Hardy; and going further back, Mary E Mann and the Brontë sisters. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 88 on the BBC's survey The Big Read."BBC – The Big Read". BBC. April 2003, Retrieved 18 November 2012

</ref> Her arrest and conviction, and the circumstances of her trials, provoked considerable attention in the United States and in Peru.
After securing press credentials for herself and a photographer, visiting Peru's Congress to interview some of its members and attend sessions where she took notes and sketched a seating plan, Berenson was arrested on a public busGuilt, repentance and innocence: Lori Berenson and her baby might be going back to prison[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011 [/tpl] along with the photographer. Her photographer turned out to be the wife of a top MRTA leader, a fact Berenson stated she was unaware of at that time. The MRTA is alleged to have intended to use the information to seize lawmakers and exchange the hostages for imprisoned MRTA members. The house she rented in Lima was found to contain an arsenal of weapons and ammunition, together with armed guerrillas who violently resisted capture. She denied knowing of the presence of the weaponry or guerillas, or that the documents she prepared would be used for terrorism. In 2011 she admitted that she had known her associates were MRTA members and said: “It might not have been intentional, but the bottom line is: I did collaborate with them." In the same interview she maintained that she had not been aware that weapons were being amassed in the upper floors of her house which she had sublet to the MRTA members, or that violent actions were being planned at the Congress, stating that “at that time in Fujimori’s dictatorship, Congress was the only place that there was some sort of democratic process.”
Shortly after arrest, she made an angry statement, alleging that the MRTA was not a terrorist group, but was a revolutionary movement—a statement which caused great animosity towards her by many Peruvians.
After she was tried in 1996 by a military tribunal with a hooded judge and sentenced to life imprisonment, Berenson became "a cause celebre for human rights campaigners and a symbol for leftwing social activists around the world."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/10/peru-lori-berenson-marxist | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Freed New Yorker who aided Peru rebels wants deportation | first=Rory | last=Carroll | date=June 10, 2010 [/tpl] Although publicly known judges had previously been killed in Peru by the MRTA, other elements of her trial were considered to be violations of human rights and to lack in impartiality, provoking controversy in the United States and other countries.

She was found guilty of collaboration with terrorism and sentenced to 20 years of prison. She served 15 years, and was granted conditional release in May 2010. In August 2010 an appeals court ordered that Berenson be arrested and made to serve out the remainder of her sentence. On November 5, 2010, a Peruvian judge ordered she be released from prison.

A melodrama is a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions, often with strongly stereotyped characters. Language, behaviour, or events which resemble melodramas are also called melodramatic. In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action. 
Melodrama is a style of drama that has been applied on the stage, in movies and television, and radio formats, from the 18th century to the present.  Because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, it is difficult to derive a precise definition.  The term melodrama is most often used pejoratively,[tpl]cite book|last=Brooks|first=Peter|title=The Melodramatic Imagination: Balzac, Henry James, Melodrama, and the Mode of Excess|year=1995|page=xv|publisher=Yale University Press[/tpl] to suggest that the work the term is applied to lacks sophistication or subtlety.
The term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).[tpl]Cite book |editor-last=Costello |editor-first=Robert B. |year=1991 |title=Random House Webster's College Dictionary |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page=845 |isbn=978-0-679-40110-0[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |editor1-last=Stevenson |editor1-first=Angus |editor2-last= Lindberg |editor2-first=Christine A. |year=2010 |title=New Oxford American Dictionary, Third Edition |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=1091 |isbn=978-0-19-539288-3[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |editor-last=Pickett |editor-first=Joseph P. |year=2006 |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, fourth edition |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=544, 1095 |isbn=978-0-618-70173-5[/tpl]

It was largely created as a simplified and less "feminine" style than the "Spencerian Method", which had been the major standardized system of handwriting since the 1840s.Tyler; RobinDVC (2010-04-12). Palmer Method of Penmanship. NYU Dead Media Archive, 12 April 2010. Retrieved from http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Palmer_Method_of_Penmanship#Precursors_and_Palmer.27s_Method. The Palmer Method soon became the most popular handwriting system in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Under the method, students were taught to adopt a uniform system of cursive writing with rhythmic motions.  Left-handers were usually made to use their right hands.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

[[Novotny (chess)]]
CATEGORIES: Chess problems

The Novotny (also often spelled as Nowotny, even in non-German sources) is a device found in chess problems named after its discoverer Antonín Novotný. A white piece is sacrificed on a square where it could be taken by two different black pieces - whichever black piece makes the capture, it interferes with the other. It is essentially a Grimshaw brought about by a white sacrifice on the critical square.
This pattern can arise as part of a combination in an actual game, but it is extremely rare (see games below). Most chess players would not use the term "Novotny" to describe such a move, since that term is almost exclusively used in the context of chess problems.

[[Agar plate]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiological media, Laboratory equipment, Microbiology terms, Microbiology equipment

An agar plate is a Petri dish that contains a growth medium (typically agar plus nutrients) used to culture microorganisms or small plants like the moss Physcomitrella patens.
Selective growth compounds may also be added to the media, such as antibiotics.[tpl]cite book | author = Madigan M, Martinko J (editors). | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th ed. | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2005 | isbn =0-13-144329-1 [/tpl]
Individual microorganisms placed on the plate will grow into individual colonies, each a clone genetically identical to the individual ancestor organism (except for the low, unavoidable rate of mutation). Thus, the plate can be used either to estimate the concentration of organisms in a liquid culture or a suitable dilution of that culture using a colony counter, or to generate genetically pure cultures from a mixed culture of genetically different organisms, using a technique known as "streaking". In this technique, a drop of the culture on the end of a thin, sterile loop of wire, sometimes known as an inoculator, is streaked across the surface of the agar leaving organisms behind, a higher number at the beginning of the streak and a lower number at the end. At some point during a successful "streak", the number of organisms deposited will be such that distinct individual colonies will grow in that area which may be removed for further culturing, using another sterile loop.

[[Gentamicin]]
CATEGORIES: Aminoglycoside antibiotics, World Health Organization essential medicines, Toxicology, Otologicals

Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic composed of a mixture of related gentamicin components and fractions and is used to treat many types of bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Gram-negative organisms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Moulds, Robert and Jeyasingham, Melanie |journal=Australian Prescriber |title=Gentamicin: a great way to start |date=October 2010 |issue=33 |pages=134–135 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/5/134/5[/tpl] However, gentamicin is not used for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis or Legionella pneumophila. Gentamicin is also ototoxic and nephrotoxic, with this toxicity remaining a major problem in clinical use.
It is synthesized by Micromonospora, a genus of Gram-positive bacteria widely present in the environment (water and soil). To highlight their specific biological origins, gentamicin and other related antibiotics produced by this genus (verdamicin, mutamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, retymicin) generally have their spellings ending in ~micin and not in ~mycin. Gentamicin is a bactericidal antibiotic that works by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis.
Like all aminoglycosides, when gentamicin is given orally, it is not systemically active. This is because it is not absorbed to any appreciable extent from the small intestine. It is administered intravenously, intramuscularly or topically to treat infections.  It appears to be completely eliminated unchanged in the urine. Urine must be collected for many days to recover all of a given dose because the drug binds avidly to certain tissues.
E. coli has shown some resistance to gentamicin, despite being Gram-negative. Reluctance to use gentamicin for empirical therapy has led to increased use of alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, which some experts suggest has led to the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections by MRSA and other so-called "superbugs".
Gentamicin is one of the few heat-stable antibiotics that remain active even after autoclaving, which makes it particularly useful in the preparation of some microbiological growth media.  It is used during orthopaedic surgery when high temperatures are required for the setting of cements (e.g. hip replacements).[tpl]cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00554-4 | author=Hendriks JGE, van Horn JR, van der Mei HC, and Busscher, HJ| title=Backgrounds of antibiotic-loaded bone cement and prosthesis-related infection| journal=Biomaterials | year=2004 | volume=25 | issue=3 | pages=545–556 | pmid=14585704[/tpl]

[[Combination (chess)]]

CATEGORIES: Chess terminology, Chess tactics

In chess, a combination is a sequence of moves, often initiated by a sacrifice, which leaves the opponent few options and results in tangible gain.  At most points in a chess game, each player has several reasonable options from which to choose, which makes it difficult to plan ahead except in strategic terms.  Combinations, in contrast to the norm, are sufficiently forcing that one can calculate exactly how advantage will be achieved against any defense.  Indeed, it is usually necessary to see several moves ahead in exact detail before launching a combination, or else the initial sacrifice would not be undertaken.

Human Being  is the third album by Seal.  It was released in 1998 as a tribute to the murdered rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. Human Being received mixed reviews ranging from being panned for its overtly dark and moody feel, to being described in terms such as "pop perfection." The album failed to sell in the same way as his 1994 multi-platinum album, Seal.
A remix of "Lost My Faith" was featured over the closing credits of the 1999 film Entrapment, and the song's single release was accompanied by a music video in which Seal is integrated into scenes from the film alongside Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

There are other ways to accumulate miles: In recent years, more miles were awarded for using co-branded credit and debit cards than for air travel. Acquired miles can be redeemed for air travel, other goods or services, or for increased benefits, such as travel class upgrades, airport lounge access, or priority bookings.

[[Research and development]]

CATEGORIES: Research and development

The research and development (R&D, also called research and technical development or research and technological development, RTD in Europe) is a specific group of activities within a business. The activities that are classified as R&D differ from company to company, but there are two primary models. In one model, the primary function of an R&D group is to develop new products; in the other model, the primary function of an R&D group is to discover and create new knowledge about scientific and technological topics for the purpose of uncovering and enabling development of valuable new products, processes, and services. Under both models, R&D differs from the vast majority of a company's activities which are intended to yield nearly immediate profit or immediate improvements in operations and involve little uncertainty as to the return on investment (ROI). The first model of R&D is generally staffed by engineers while the second model may be staffed with industrial scientists.
R&D activities are carried out by corporate (businesses) or governmental entities.

Alexander Konstantinovich Glazunov[tpl]Lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Константи́нович Глазуно́в[/tpl], Aleksandr Konstantinovič Glazunov; [tpl]lang-fr|Glazounov[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ger|Glasunow[/tpl] (10 AugustOld Style date 29 July 1865 – 21 March 1936) was a Russian composer of the late Russian Romantic period, music teacher and conductor. He served as director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory between 1905 and 1928 and was also instrumental in the reorganization of the institute into the Petrograd Conservatory, then the Leningrad Conservatory, following the Bolshevik Revolution. He continued heading the Conservatory until 1930, though he had left the Soviet Union in 1928 and did not return. The best known student under his tenure during the early Soviet years was Dmitri Shostakovich.
Glazunov was significant in that he successfully reconciled nationalism and cosmopolitanism in Russian music. While he was the direct successor to Balakirev's nationalism, he tended more towards Borodin's epic grandeur while absorbing a number of other influences. These included Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestral virtuosity, Tchaikovsky's lyricism and Taneyev's contrapuntal skill. His weaknesses were a streak of academicism which sometimes overpowered his inspiration and an eclecticism which could sap the ultimate stamp of originality from his music.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] Younger composers such as Prokofiev and Shostakovich eventually considered his music old-fashioned while also admitting he remained a composer with an imposing reputation and a stabilizing influence in a time of transition and turmoil.Schwarz, New Grove, 939–940.

A sidesplit is a split-level home configuration where the multiple levels are visible from the front elevation.  Typically, the garage is on one side of the house and there is a floor above the garage housing the bedrooms.  The other half of the house is the main living area, part of a story above the garage level and part of a story below the bedroom level.  Grading or steps connect the exterior street to the front door on the main level.
The advantage of sidesplits (and its closely related backsplit) is that it separates bedrooms from living space without the need for a full flight of stairs.  It is less land efficient than a two-story house but more efficient than a bungalow.
Most sidesplits have a crawlspace that is half the size of the house such that the foundation is the same for both halves of the "split" house. Some others may have a split foundation with a full basement below even the lower main living area.

[[Coherent (operating system)]]

CATEGORIES: Unix variants, Lightweight Unix-like systems, Discontinued operating systems

The Coherent operating system was a Version 7 Unix clone by the now-defunct Mark Williams Company, originally produced for the PDP-11 in 1980. A port was introduced in 1983 as the first Unix-like system for IBM PC compatible computers.
Coherent was able to run on most Intel-based PCs with Intel 8088, 286, 386, and 486 processors. Coherent version 3 for Intel-based PCs required at least a 286, Coherent version 4 for Intel-based PCs required at least a 386. Like a true Unix, Coherent was able to multitask and support multiple users. From version 4 on Coherent also had support for X11 and MGR windowing systems.
Later versions of Coherent (version 4 and higher) supported features common in modern Unix-like systems, including a version of MicroEMACS, access to DOS FAT16 File systems, an optimizing C compiler with linker, and a modified version of Taylor UUCP. The final releases of Coherent also fully supported the iBCS COFF binary standard, which allowed binary compatibily with SCO Unix applications, including WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, and several Microsoft applications including QuickBASIC, Microsoft Word, and MultiPlan. There was no support for virtual memory or demand paging. Coherent predates both MINIX and Linux by many years.
A Zilog Z8000 port of Coherent was also used by the canceled Commodore 900 system.
Coherent was not Unix; the Mark Williams Company had no rights to either the Unix trademark or the AT&T/Bell Labs source code. In the early years of its existence, MWC received a visit from an AT&T delegation looking to determine whether MWC was infringing on AT&T Unix property. The delegation included Dennis Ritchie, who concluded that "it was very hard to believe that Coherent and its basic applications were not created without considerable study of the OS code and details of its applications" and "that looking at various corners peculiarities, bugs, etc. that I knew about in the Unix distributions of the time I couldn't find anything that was copied. It might have been that some parts were written with AT&T source nearby, but at least the effort had been made to rewrite. If it came to it, I could never honestly testify ... that what they generated was irreproducible from the manual."
Much of the operating system was written by alumni from the University of Waterloo: Tom Duff, Dave Conroy, Randall Howard, Johann George, and Trevor John Thompson. Significant contributions were also made by people such as Nigel Bree (from Auckland, New Zealand). Nigel went on to write "Ghost" - later bought out and fully commercialized as Norton Ghost.
The Mark Williams Company closed in 1995.Closing Announcement

[tpl]Nihongo|Ōsaka Station|大阪駅|Ōsaka-eki[/tpl] is a major railway station in the Umeda district of Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). It forms the city's main rail terminal in the north.
Although it is officially served by only the JR Kobe/Kyoto Lines (Tōkaidō Main Line) and the Osaka Loop Line, Osaka is the starting point of JR Takarazuka Line service, and serves as the terminal for trains bound for the San'in region via JR Takarazuka Line and the Hokuriku region via JR Kyoto Line, while offering connections to trains bound for Nara, Wakayama and Kansai International Airport via the Osaka Loop Line.
Umeda Station (Hankyu, Hanshin, and Osaka Municipal Subway Midosuji Line), Nishi-Umeda Station (Subway Yotsubashi Line) and Higashi-Umeda Station (Subway Tanimachi Line) are directly connected to Ōsaka Station, and Kitashinchi Station on the JR Tōzai Line is within walking distance.
Ōsaka Station and Umeda Station, effectively part of the same complex, together constitute the busiest station in Western Japan, serving 2,343,727 passengers daily in 2005, and therefore the third-busiest railway station in the world.
Ōsaka Station also houses a large terminal for overnight bus services to other cities in Japan, and until March 2013 also had a nearby freight terminal complex, Umeda Freight Terminal, owned by JR Freight.

Simply Smiffy was a comic strip in the UK comic The Beano, first appearing in issue 2254, dated 28 September 1985, and continuing for a year or so after that. It was drawn by Jerry Swaffield.
A spin-off from The Bash Street Kids, it featured Smiffy (a character from that strip) plus his brother, Normal Norman. With Norman being the straight man of the two, the humour lay in the fact that Smiffy never managed to get anything right.
An earlier Smiffy spin-off appeared in The Beano in 1971 which featured Smiffy trying out inventions sent in by Beano readers. 
Simply Smiffy returned to The Beano in the Funsize Funnies in #3660 drawn by Paul Palmer.
Another unrelated strip entitled Smiffy appeared in The Beezer in the 1960s which featured a boy who liked getting dirty. This strip was drawn by Bill Ritchie.

The East Cape War, sometimes also called the East Coast War, was a series of conflicts fought in the North Island of New Zealand from April 1865 to October 1866 between colonial military forces and Māori. At least five separate campaigns were fought in the area during a period of relative peace in the long-running 19th century New Zealand wars. 
The east coast hostilities came at the close of the Waikato wars and before the outbreak of Te Kooti's War, both fought nearby, but sprang from causes more closely related to the Second Taranaki War—namely, Māori resentment of punitive government land confiscation coupled with the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the Pai Marire religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity.[tpl]cite book | first= James| last= Belich| year= 1986| title= The New Zealand Wars and the Victorian Interpretation of Racial Conflict| edition= 1st| publisher= Penguin| location= Auckland| pages=204-205| isbn= 0-14-011162-X[/tpl]
Pai Mārire arrived on the east coast from Taranaki about 1865. The subsequent ritual killing of missionary Carl Volkner by Pai Mārire followers at Opotiki on 2 March 1865 sparked settler fears of an outbreak of violence and later that year the New Zealand government launched a lengthy expedition to hunt for Volkner's killers and neutralise the movement's influence. Rising tensions between Pai Mārire followers and conservative Māori led to a number of wars between and within Māori iwi, with kūpapa or "loyal" Māori armed by the government in a bid to exterminate the movement.
Major conflicts within the campaign included the cavalry and artillery attack on Te Tarata pā near Opotiki in October 1865 in which about 35 Māori were killed, and the seven-day siege of Waerenga-a-Hika in November 1865. The government, claiming that one of Volkner's killers was being given sanctuary by Māori in the remote Urewera region, confiscated northern parts of the Urewera land in January 1866 in a bid to break down Māori resistance and confiscated additional land in Hawke's Bay a year later after a rout of a Māori party it deemed to pose a threat to the settlement of Napier. In 2013 the Crown paid $23 million in financial redress and expressed "profound regret" over the "unjust attacks" in Hawke's Bay in 1866 and apologised for subsequent land confiscations.

[[Audio mastering]]

CATEGORIES: Audio engineering, Optical disc authoring, Sound recording, Music industry

Mastering, a form of audio post-production, is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the final mix to a data storage device (the master); the source from which all copies will be produced (via methods such as pressing, duplication or replication). Recently digital masters have become usual although analog masters, such as audio tapes, are still being used by the manufacturing industry, notably by a few engineers who have chosen to specialize in analog mastering.
Mastering requires critical listening; however, software tools exist to facilitate the process. Results still depend upon the accuracy of speaker monitors and the listening environment. Mastering engineers may also need to apply corrective equalization and dynamic compression in order to optimise sound translation on all playback systems.  It is standard practice to make a copy of a master recording, known as a safety copy, in case the master is lost, damaged or stolen.

Located in the Ruhr industrial area, Bottrop adjoins Essen, Oberhausen, Gladbeck and Dorsten. The city had been a coal-mining and rail center and contains factories producing coal-tar derivatives, chemicals, textiles, and machinery. Bottrop grew as a mining center beginning in the 1860s, was chartered as a city in 1921, and bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. In 1975 it unified with the neighbour communities of Gladbeck and Kirchhellen, but Gladbeck left it in 1976, leading to Kirchhellen becoming a district of Bottrop as Bottrop-Kirchhellen. 40% of the citys population is of Polish descent, mostly descendants of late 19th century immigrants.

Eof (also Eoves) was a swineherd who claimed to have seen a vision of the Virgin Mary at Evesham in England, about 701.[tpl]CathEncy|id=05648a|title=Evesham Abbey[/tpl] Eof related this vision to Egwin, Bishop of Worcester, who founded the great Evesham Abbey on the site of the apparition. Evesham means Eof's ham (homestead).
Some people think Eof may have been a shepherd. The standard Lives,Butler’s Lives of the Saints, vol. IV, p.643 and Saint Egwin and his Abbey of Evesham Saint Egwin and his Abbey of Evesham, by the Benedictines of Stanbrook, p.14 say Eof was a swineherd. The confusion may come from a letter, apparently written by Ecgwin, which says "... primum cuidam pastori gregum ...", and the Acta Sanctorum (Lives of the Saints) which states something similar: " ...pastores gregum ..." The Latin means either a shepherd or a herdsman. William Dugdale in Monasticon Anglicanum says "Eoves, a herdsman of the bishop ...". George May, the most eminent of Evesham historians, gives both herdsman and swineherd.Descriptive History of Evesham, p22
The story that Eof was a swineherd goes back at least to William of Malmesbury, writing in the twelfth century, while the obverse of the conventual seal of Evesham Abbey clearly shows stylised pigs rather than sheep.George May, Descriptive History of Evesham, p.87.The Book of Evesham, p.24 The monks of the Abbey clearly thought Eof kept pigs.
The legend of Eof's vision has been commemorated by a bronze statue sited in the town centre paid for by public subscription and created by the British born sculptor John McKenna.  The statue was unveiled in a public ceremony that took place on Sunday 15 June 2008.

According to the monastic history, Evesham came through the Norman Conquest unusually well, because of a quick approach by Abbot Æthelwig to William the Conqueror.Historia Only one section of walling survives from the actual abbey, although fragments of the chapter house, the bell tower and the gateway remain, which were added later: the chapter house in the 13th century and the bell tower in the 16th century. Simon de Montfort (1208–1265) is buried beneath the high altar of the ruined abbey, the spot marked by an altar-like memorial monument dedicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1965.http://www.simondemontfort.org/simon_de_montfort.htm The abbey is of Benedictine origin, and became in its heyday one of the wealthiest in the country.

Diamond was, according to legend, Sir Isaac Newton's favorite dog, which, by upsetting a candle, set fire to manuscripts containing his notes on experiments conducted over the course of twenty years.

ISBN 0-19-850364-4. The story is largely apocryphal: according to another account, Newton simply left a window open when he went to church, and the candle was knocked over by a gust of wind.Jason Socrates Bardi, The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Times. Thunder's Mouth Press, 2006, p. 159. ISBN 1-56025-706-7. In fact, some historians claim that Newton never owned pets.
The story of "Newton's Mischief" has been reproduced over the centuries as early as 1833 in "The Life of Sir Isaac Newton"The Life of Sir Isaac Newton by David Brewster and later in St. Nicholas Magazine.St. Nicholas Magazine, Vol. 5, No. 4, (February 1878) In 1816 Walter Scott used the story in the third of his Waverley Novels, The Antiquary (volume 2, chapter 1).
This pet of Newton's was also mentioned in Thomas Carlyle's book The French Revolution: A History, employed in discussing the deathbed of Louis XV. Carlyle writes "To the eye of History many things, in that sick room of Louis, are now visible, which to the courtiers there present were invisible. For indeed it as been well said, 'in every object there is inexhaustible meaning; the eye sees in it what the eye brings means of seeing.' To Newton and to Newton's dog Diamond, what a different pair of Universes; while the painting on the optical retina of both was, most likely, the same!"
Nevertheless, Diamond is the subject of several anecdotes concerning Newton. In another tale, Newton is said to have claimed that the dog discovered two theorems in a single morning. He added, however, that "one had a mistake and the other had a pathological exception.""Historical Canines," Shepherd Software. Retrieved September 16, 2007.

Scissors are hand-operated shearing instruments. They consist of a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles (bows) opposite to the pivot are closed. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, thin plastic, cloth, rope, and wire. Scissors can also be used to cut hair. Hair cutting scissors have a specific blade angle ideal for cutting hair. Using the incorrect scissors to cut hair will result in increased damage and or split ends by breaking the hair. Food scissors, also known as kitchen scissors, are for cutting and trimming foods such as meats.

AsaEncyclopedia Britannica Philip Randolph (April 15, 1889 – May 16, 1979) was a leader in the  African-American civil-rights movement, the American labor movement and socialist political parties.
He organized and led the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first predominantly black labor union. In the early civil-rights movement, Randolph led the March on Washington Movement, which convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802 in 1941, banning discrimination in the defense industries during World War II. The group then successfully pressured President Harry S. Truman to issue Executive Order 9981 in 1948, ending segregation in the armed services.
In 1963, Randolph was the head of the March on Washington, which was organized by Bayard Rustin, at which Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his "I Have A Dream" speech. Randolph inspired the Freedom budget, sometimes called the "Randolph Freedom budget", which aimed to deal with the economic problems facing the black community.
Randolph was born April 15, 1889, in Crescent City, Florida,2 the second son of the Rev. James William Randolph, a tailor and minister2 in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Elizabeth Robinson Randolph, a skilled seamstress. In 1891 the family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, which had a thriving, well-established African-American community.3
From his father, Randolph learned that color was less important than a person's character and conduct. From his mother, he learned the importance of education and of defending oneself physically against those who would seek to hurt one or one's family, if necessary. Randolph remembered vividly the night his mother sat in the front room of their house with a loaded shotgun across her lap, while his father tucked a pistol under his coat and went off to prevent a mob from lynching a man at the local county jail.
Asa and his brother, James, were superior students. They attended the Cookman Institute in East Jacksonville, the only academic high school in Florida for African Americans.4 Asa excelled in literature, drama and public speaking; he also starred on the school's baseball team, sang solos with its choir and was valedictorian of the 1907 graduating class.
After graduation, Randolph worked odd jobs and devoted his time to singing, acting and reading. Reading W. E. B. Du Bois' The Souls of Black Folk convinced him that the fight for social equality was most important. Barred by discrimination from all but manual jobs in the South, Randolph moved to New York City in 1911, where he worked at odd jobs and took social sciences courses at City College.[

[[Albino (chess)]]
CATEGORIES: Chess problems

An Albino is a type of chess problem in which, at some stage in the solution, a White pawn, beginning on its starting square, makes each of its four possible moves: one square forward, two squares forward, capture to the left, and capture to the right. When a Black pawn exhibits similar activity it is instead termed a Pickaninny.

A simple example of an Albino is the problem to the right, a mate in 2 (White moves first and must checkmate Black in two moves against any defense). It is by Camil Seneca and was first published in the April 1949 edition of the Bulletin Ouvrier des Echecs.  The first move of the solution (or key) is 1.Nb1.  This threatens 2.Ra3#.  Black has four ways to defend against this, each of which leads to a different move of the White pawn.  After 1...Bb3, the only move that mates is 2.cxb3# (the pawn captures to the left).  After 1..Bd3, the only mate is 2.cxd3# (capturing to the right).  After 1...Bb5 only 2.c3# will do (forward one square; 2.c4 is no good because the b4 square needs to be covered by the pawn now the White queen has been cut off).  After 1...Bd5 only 2.c4# will do (2.c3 is no good, because Black could play 2...Bb3).
 

The Albino pawn moves need not necessarily be in the post-key play of the problem; they can instead be tries: moves which almost solve a problem but which fail to a single Black defense.  The mate in 2 to the right, which combines the Albino with a Pickaninny, is an example.  It is by Lev Loshinsky and was published in Moskau-Rostow in 1930.  The key is 1.Nfd5 (threatening 2. Qf4#) with the variations 1...g5 2. h8=Q#; 1...Rxc3/Rxd5 2.Qf5#; and 1...Rd4 2.Qxg7/f5#.  The main point of the problem however, is in the Albino tries, each of which is refuted by a Pickaninny defense.  The relevant variations are:
In each of these cases there are other ways for Black to counter White's threat, but the Pickaninny move is the only one that doesn't give White a new mate (for example, after 1.exf3, Bg6 prevents White's threats, but is not any good because it allows 2.Rxe6#).

The nature of the Albino theme is such that in orthodox chess there must be at least four variations to show the four different moves of the White pawn.  However, if the rules of circe chess are applied, the number of required variations can be reduced to two (circe is a chess variant in which captured pieces, rather than being removed from the board, are returned to their home squares).  The problem to the right is an example; it is by Adrian Storisteanu and was first published in the British Chess Magazine in 1977.  The problem is a helpmate in 2, which means Black moves first and cooperates with White to move to a position where Black is in checkmate after White's second move.  This problem features grasshoppers (represented here by inverted queens), a fairy chess piece which moves along the same lines as a queen, but which must "hop" over another piece (friendly or enemy) and land on the square immediately beyond.
There are two solutions to the problem (note that in helpmates, Black's moves are given first):
The first solution has the White pawn moving forward one square, then, after its rebirth on c2, capturing to the right; the second solution has the pawn first moving two squares and then capturing to the left.  Problems like this, showing an Albino with fewer than four variations, are very unusual.

Passport to Pimlico is a 1949 British comedy film made by Ealing Studios and starring Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford and Hermione Baddeley. It was directed by Henry Cornelius.
The script was written by T.E.B. Clarke and demonstrated his usual logical development of absurd ideas. Some scenes in which the residents are refused passage out of their district into London by the authorities, and rely on supplies thrown over the dividing wall by well-wishers, were very topical because the film was made during the Berlin blockade.
The film was inspired by a true incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that, when Princess Margriet of the Netherlands was born there, she would not lose her right to the throne.[tpl]cite web |last=Wells |first=Paul |publisher=filmreference.com |title=Passport to Pimlico |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Or-Pi/Passport-to-Pimlico.html |accessdate=2007-07-27[/tpl]

Ralph Roister Doister is a comic play by Nicholas Udall, generally regarded as the first comedy to be written in the English language.Angela O'Brien, RALPH ROISTER DOISTER: the first regular English comedy (2004)
The date of its composition is disputed, but the balance of opinion suggests that it was written in about 1553, when Udall was a schoolmaster in London, and was intended to be performed by his pupils - who were all male, as were all actors at that period.  However, the work was not published until 1567, eleven years after its author's death.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] It takes its theme from the Miles Gloriosus written by the Roman playwright Plautus.
The play is written in five acts. The plot of the play centres around a rich widow, Christian Custance, who is betrothed to Gawyn Goodluck, a merchant. Ralph Roister Doister is prompted by a friend to woo Christian Custance, but his pompous attempts do not succeed. Ralph then tries with his friends to break in and take Christian Custance by force, but they are defeated by her servants and run away. The merchant Gawyn arrives shortly after and the play concludes happily.
Gender politics is a very interesting aspect of this play, which was an innovative experiment in the field of English drama. The play is probably best described as a farce, and it owes something to the Latin playwrights Plautus and Terence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

[[Luwian language]]
CATEGORIES: Luwian language, Ancient languages, Extinct languages of Asia

Luwian (sometimes spelled Luvian, rarely Luish) is an ancient language or group of languages of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family. The two varieties of Luwian are named for the scripts that they were written in: Cuneiform Luwian (CLuwian) and Hieroglyphic Luwian (HLuwian). As to whether these were one language or two, there is no consensus.
Several other languages in Anatolia have been identified as being most similar to Luwian, which suggests that they belong in their own branch with CLuwian and HLuwian. Some linguists name the branch "the Luwian Group" or just "Luwian" and, in that sense, Luwian means all of the Luwian languages. Other linguists, following Melchert, prefer to use Luwic for the branch and Luwian for CLuwian and HLuwian.[tpl]harvnb|Melchert|2012|p=14[/tpl] Proto-Luwian can mean the common ancestor of the two, or the common ancestor of the several although, in the tree-naming conventions, if the branch is to be called Luwic, its ancestor should be Proto-Luwic or Common Luwic.

[tpl]Merge|Feekes scale|Zadoks scale|BBCH-scale (cereals)|target=Feekes scale|discuss=Talk:Feekes_scale#Merger_Proposal|date=March 2012[/tpl]The Zadoks scale is a cereal development scale proposed by the Dutch phytopathologist Jan C. Zadoks that is widely used in cereal research and agriculture.
Knowing the stages of development of a crop is critical in many management decisions that growers make.  They are represented on a scale from 10 to 92.  For example, in some countries, nitrogen and herbicide applications must be completed during the tillering stage. In France, the recommendation for the first nitrogen application on wheat is 6 weeks before Z30, with the second application on Z30. Wheat growth regulators are typically applied at Z30. Disease control is most critical in the stem extension and heading stage (Z31, Z32, Z35), in particular as soon as the flag leaf is out (Z37). The crop is also more sensitive to heat or frost at some stages than others (for example, during the meiosis stage the crop is very sensitive to low temperature). Knowing the growth stage of the crop when checking for problems is essential for deciding which control measures should be followed.

Another cereal development scale is the Feekes scale.

The terms Nondestructive examination (NDE), Nondestructive inspection (NDI), and Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.
Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. Common NDT methods include ultrasonic, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, remote visual inspection (RVI), eddy-current testing, and low coherence interferometry.[tpl]cite doi|10.1784/insi.47.4.216.63149[/tpl]

I Know What You Did Last Summer is a  1997 American slasher film based on the 1973 novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. The film changes many aspects of the book, which was not a slasher novel. The film also draws inspiration from the Urban Legend known as The Hook.
The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., with Anne Heche and Bridgette Wilson appearing in supporting roles. I Know What You Did Last Summer centers on four friends who are being stalked by a killer, one year after covering up a car accident in which they were involved. The film was directed by Jim Gillespie, from a screenplay written by Kevin Williamson, writer of Scream.
I Know What You Did Last Summer received mixed reviews from critics, but was highly commercially successful, grossing over $125 million at the box office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=iknowwhatyoudidlastsummer.htm |title=Daily Box Office Calendar |publisher=Box Office Mojo[/tpl] It was also nominated for and won multiple awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119345/awards |title=I Know What You Did Last Summer - Awards |publisher=Internet Movie Database[/tpl] As a result the film has been parodied and referenced in popular culture.[tpl]cite journal |title=Wayans Brothers' Comedy Style A Hit In 'Scary Movie' |journal=Jet (magazine) |volume=98 |page=58 |date=14 August 2000[/tpl]

[[Destructive testing]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanical tests, Earthquake engineering, Evaluation methods, Tests, Product testing

In destructive testing, or (Destructive Physical Analysis DPA) tests are carried out to the specimen's failure, in order to understand a specimen's structural performance or material behaviour under different loads.  These tests are generally much easier to carry out, yield more information, and are easier to interpret than nondestructive testing.
https://www.reliabilityanalysislab.com/ral_reliabilityServ_CADPA.html
Destructive testing is most suitable, and economic, for objects which will be mass-produced, as the cost of destroying a small number of specimens is negligible. It is usually not economical to do destructive testing where only one or very few items are to be produced (for example, in the case of a building). Analyzing and documenting the destructive failure mode is often accomplished using a high-speed camera recording continuously (movie-loop) until the failure is detected. Detecting the failure can be accomplish using a sound detector or stress gauge which produces a signal to trigger the high-speed camera.  These high-speed cameras have advanced recording modes to capture almost any type of destructive failure.[tpl]cite web|last= Bridges|first= Andrew |title=Video imaging puts high-speed production line/automation faultfinding into tiny camera heads|url=http://www.appliancemagazine.com/content/2182|accessdate= May 2009|publisher=APPLIANCE Magazine[/tpl]  After the failure the high-speed camera will stop recording.  The capture images can be played back in slow motion showing precisely what happen before, during and after the destructive event, image by image.

[[Tensor (intrinsic definition)]]

CATEGORIES: Tensors

In mathematics, the modern component-free approach to the theory of  a tensor views a tensor as an abstract object, expressing some definite type of multi-linear concept. Their well-known properties can be derived from their definitions, as linear maps or more generally; and the rules for manipulations of tensors arise as an extension of linear algebra to multilinear algebra.
In differential geometry an intrinsic geometric statement may be described by a tensor field on a manifold, and then doesn't need to make reference to coordinates at all. The same is true in general relativity, of tensor fields describing a physical property. The component-free approach is also used heavily in abstract algebra and homological algebra, where tensors arise naturally.

The Symphony No. 8 in F Major, Op. 93 is a symphony in four movements composed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1812. Beethoven fondly referred to it as "my little Symphony in F," distinguishing it from his Sixth Symphony, a longer work also in F.http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5485221
The Eighth Symphony is generally light-hearted, though not lightweight, and in many places cheerfully loud, with many accented notes. Various passages in the symphony are heard by some listeners to be musical jokes.Some instances given by Hopkins (1981; 224, 232, 233–4, 236–7) are:  1st mvt. bars 36–37 (bassoon mimicry), the "breaking of the metronome" passage at end of the second movement, the shift of the minuet into 2/4 time, and the hesitancy in the last movement about whether the exposition will be repeated or not. As with various other Beethoven works such as the Opus 27 piano sonatas, the symphony deviates from Classical tradition in making the last movement the weightiest of the four.

In the letter, Gates expressed frustration with most computer hobbyists who were using his company's Altair BASIC software without having paid for it. He asserted that such widespread unauthorized copying in effect discourages developers from investing time and money in creating high-quality software. He cited the unfairness of gaining the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them.

Baker was the first African-American woman to star in a major motion picture, Zouzou (1934) or to become a world-famous entertainer. Baker, who refused to perform for segregated audiences in America, is also noted for her contributions to the Civil Rights Movement. She was once offered unofficial leadership in the movement in the United States by Coretta Scott King in 1968, following Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination.

Operation Paperclip was the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) program used to recruit the scientists of Nazi Germany for employment by the United States in the aftermath of World War II. It was conducted by the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA), and in the context of the burgeoning Cold War. One purpose of Operation Paperclip was to deny German scientific expertise and knowledge to the Soviet Union[tpl]cite web |title=Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency |url=http://www.archives.gov/iwg/declassified-records/rg-330-defense-secretary/ |publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl] and the United Kingdom,The Secret War, 1978, Brian Johnson, p184 as well as inhibiting post-war Germany from redeveloping its military research capabilities.
Although the JIOA's recruitment of German scientists began after the Allied victory in Europe on May 8, 1945, U.S. President Harry Truman did not formally order the execution of Operation Paperclip until August 1945. Truman's order expressly excluded anyone found "to have been a member of the Nazi Party, and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazi militarism". However, those restrictions would have rendered ineligible most of the leading scientists the JIOA had identified for recruitment, among them rocket scientists Wernher von Braun, Kurt H. Debus and Arthur Rudolph, and the physician Hubertus Strughold, each earlier classified as a "menace to the security of the Allied Forces".
To circumvent President Truman's anti-Nazi order and the Allied Potsdam and Yalta agreements, the JIOA worked independently to create false employment and political biographies for the scientists. The JIOA also expunged from the public record the scientists' Nazi Party memberships and régime affiliations. Once "bleached" of their Nazism, the scientists were granted security clearances by the U.S. government to work in the United States. Paperclip, the project's operational name, derived from the paperclips used to attach the scientists' new political personae to their "US Government Scientist" JIOA personnel files.Project Paperclip: German Scientists and the Cold War, 1975, Clarence G.

Unlike conventional ales and lagers, which are fermented by carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeasts, lambic beer is produced by spontaneous fermentation: it is exposed to the wild yeasts and bacteria that are said to be native to the Zenne valley, in which Brussels lies. It is this unusual process which gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, vinous, and cidery, usually with a sour aftertaste.

Nancy Laura Spungen (February 27, 1958 – October 12, 1978) was the girlfriend of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and a figure of the 1970s punk rock scene. Spungen's life, and her death, have been the subject of controversy among music historians and fans of the Sex Pistols.
Raised in Philadelphia, Spungen was an emotionally disturbed child who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 15. After being expelled from college, she went to London at the height of the punk rock craze and became involved with Sid Vicious. Their relationship was punctuated by bouts of domestic violence and drug abuse. The press soon labelled Spungen "Nauseating Nancy" for her shocking behavior. After the Sex Pistols disbanded, the couple moved to New York City and checked into the Hotel Chelsea. They spent their days consuming drugs and were regularly visited by drug dealers.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In October 1978, Spungen was found dead in the bathroom of the couple's room, of a single stab wound to the abdomen. Sid Vicious was charged with her murder but died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, before the case went to trial. Various authors and filmmakers have speculated about Vicious' role in Spungen's death and the possibility that Spungen was killed by a drug dealer who frequented their room.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

[[2 + 2 = 5]]
CATEGORIES: Nineteen Eighty-Four, Elementary arithmetic, Mind control

The phrase "two plus two equals five" ("2 + 2 = 5") is a slogan used in many different forms of media, but more specifically in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-FourPart One, Chapter Seven as an example of an obviously false dogma one may be required to believe, similar to other obviously false slogans by the Party in the novel. It is contrasted with the phrase "two plus two makes four", the obvious — but politically inexpedient — truth.
Orwell's protagonist, Winston Smith, uses the phrase to wonder if, the State might declare "two plus two equals five" as a fact; he ponders whether, if everybody believes it, does that make it true? The Inner Party interrogator of thought-criminals, O'Brien, says of the mathematically false statement that control over physical reality is unimportant; so long as one controls their own perceptions to what the Party wills, then any corporeal act is possible, in accordance with the principles of doublethink ("Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once").Part Three, Chapter Two

[[Multitrack recording]]

CATEGORIES: Multitrack recording, Sound recording

Multitrack recording (MTR)—also known as multitracking, double tracking, or tracking—is a method of sound recording that allows for the separate recording of multiple sound sources to create a cohesive whole. Multitracking became possible with the idea of simultaneously recording different audio channels to separate discrete "tracks" on the same tape—a "track" was simply a different channel recorded to its own discrete area on tape whereby their relative sequence of recorded events would be preserved, and playback would be simultaneous or synchronized.
In the 1980s and 1990s, computers provided means by which both sound recording and reproduction could be digitized, revolutionizing audio distribution. In the 2000s (decade), multitracking hardware and software for computers was of sufficient quality to be widely used for high-end audio recording. Though magnetic tape has not been universally replaced as a recording medium, the advantages of non-linear editing (NLE) and recording have resulted in digital systems largely superseding tape.

Lembitu (Estonian also: Lembit, died September 21, 1217) was an ancient Estonian elder of Sakala County and military leader in the struggle against conquest of the Estonian lands by the German Livonian Brothers of the Sword at the beginning of the 13th century. He is the only Estonian pre-Crusade ruler, about whom some biographical information is known (he is mentioned only in the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia).[tpl]cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8108-4904-4 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XKWRct15XfkC&pg=PA310[/tpl]
Lembitu, also referred to in Latin as Lambite, Lembito or Lembitus, was first mentioned in chronicles in 1211. Troops led by Lembitu destroyed a troop of missionaries in the historical Estonian county of Sakala and made a raid as far as Pskov, then a town of the Novgorod Republic. In 1215, Lembitu's Lehola (Leal) stronghold (situated near the present town of Suure-Jaani) was taken by Germans and Lembitu was taken prisoner. He was released in 1217.
Lembitu attempted to unite the Estonians in order to withstand the German conquest. He managed to assemble an army of 6,000 Estonian men from different counties, but was killed in the following Battle of St. Matthew's Day in September, 1217.[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1970 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc |page= 734 |isbn= |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=cyXwSPGlPIquywSt1qWrBw&client=firefox-a&q=%22in+1217%2C+the+knights+defeated+the+Estonians+and+killed+their+commander+Lembitu%22&btnG=Search+Books[/tpl]

[[Grain elevator]]

CATEGORIES: Grain elevators, Grain production

In the grain trade, a grain elevator is a tower containing a bucket elevator or a pneumatic conveyor, which scoops up grain from a lower level and deposits it in a silo or other storage facility. In most cases, the term "grain elevator" also covers the entire elevator complex (an example of pars pro toto), including receiving and testing offices, weighbridges, storage facilities etc. It may also mean organizations that operate or control several individual elevators, in different locations. In Australia the term grain elevator refers to the lifting mechanism only (see "usage" below).
Prior to the advent of the grain elevator, grain was usually handled in bags rather than in bulk (large quantities of loose grain). The elevator was invented by a merchant named Joseph Dart and an engineer named Robert Dunbar during 1842–43, in Buffalo, New York. Using the steam-powered flour mills of Oliver Evans as their model, they invented the marine leg, which scooped loose grain out of the hulls of ships and elevated it to the top of a marine tower.American Colossus: the Grain Elevator 1843-1943 (Colossus Books, 2009) www.american-colossus.com
Early grain elevators and bins were often constructed of framed or cribbed wood, and were prone to fire. Grain elevator bins, tanks and silos are now usually constructed of steel or reinforced concrete. Bucket elevators are used to lift grain to a distributor or consignor, from where it falls through spouts and/or conveyors and into one of a number of bins, silos or tanks in a facility. When desired, silos, bins and tanks are emptied by gravity flow, sweep augers and conveyors. As grain is emptied from bins, tanks and silos it is conveyed, blended and weighted into trucks, railroad cars or barges, and shipped to grain wholesalers, exporters and/or local end-users, such as flour mills, breweries and ethanol or alcohol distilleries.

Notorious is a 1946 American spy thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains as three people whose lives become intimately entangled during an espionage operation. It was shot in late 1945 and early 1946, and was released by RKO in August 1946.
Notorious marks a watershed for Hitchcock artistically, and represents a heightened thematic maturity. His biographer, Donald Spoto, writes that "Notorious is in fact Alfred Hitchcock's first attempt—at the age of forty-six—to bring his talents to the creation of a serious love story, and its story of two men in love with Ingrid Bergman could only have been made at this stage of his life."Spoto, Donald (1983).

Jaromír Jágr ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈjaromiːr ˈjaːɡr̩|-|Cs-Jaromir Jagr.ogg[/tpl]; born February 15, 1972) is a Czech professional ice hockey right winger currently playing for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League. He formerly played with the Pittsburgh Penguins, Washington Capitals, New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, Dallas Stars and the Boston Bruins; serving as captain of the Penguins and the Rangers. After leaving the Rangers, he played for three seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League with Avangard Omsk before returning to the NHL with the Flyers. He is the most productive European-born player who has ever played in the National Hockey League and is considered one of the greatest professional hockey players of all-time.
Jágr was the fifth overall selection in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft (Jágr and teammate Martin Brodeur are the last two players drafted in 1990 who are still active players in the NHL). He won consecutive Stanley Cups in the 1991 and 1992 seasons with the Penguins. He has won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL scoring champion five times (four times in a row), the Lester B. Pearson Award for the NHL's outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players' Association three times, and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player once, while being a finalist an additional four times.
For two decades, from 1981 to 2001, only three players won the Art Ross Trophy as the leading point-scorer over the regular season: Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr. The streak ended when Jarome Iginla won the trophy in 2002. Jágr has won the award the most of any non-Canadian player.
He is also one of only 25 hockey players in the Triple Gold Club, who have played for teams that have won the Stanley Cup (1991, 1992), the Ice Hockey World Championships (2005, 2010), and the Olympic gold medal in ice hockey (1998). Jágr is one of only two Czech players (the other being Jiří Šlégr) in the Triple Gold Club, achieving this feat in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/the-iihf/triple-gold-club.html |title=Triple Gold Club |publisher=Iihf.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14[/tpl] Jágr was the Czech Republic's flag bearer for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics.

[[Carl Zeidler]]
CATEGORIES: 1908 births, 1942 deaths, Mayors of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, American military personnel of World War II, Marquette University alumni, American military personnel killed in World War II

Carl Frederick Zeidler (January 4, 1908 – December 11, 1942) was the mayor of the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from 1940 to 1942.
Born in Milwaukee, he graduated from Marquette University in 1929 and receiving a J.D. in 1931.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2143&keyword=zeidler
Serving as an assistant city attorney for Milwaukee (1936–1940), Zeidler stunned the city when he upset six-term Socialist mayor Daniel Hoan to become mayor of Milwaukee in 1940. Hoan had served as mayor for the past 24 years.
His rise to power was orchestrated by young writers Robert Bloch (later the author of Psycho) and Harold Gauer, who created elaborate campaign shows. In Bloch's autobiography, Once Around the Bloch, he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with... for instance, the original "releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling" shtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler's election, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries, while credit was taken by local establishment figures like Milton Rice Polland instead.
He ends the account with a philosophical point:
Zeidler was attracting some attention on the national political scene[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] when World War II broke out. He believed that he could best help the war effort by enlisting; he resigned his position as mayor and accepted a Naval Reserve commission on April 8, 1942. He asked for the most dangerous job on ship and became officer in charge of a gun battery on board the merchant ship SS La Salle. The ship and all hands were reported missing off the coast of South Africa on December 11, 1942. He was officially presumed dead November 7, 1944. A gravestone cenotaph marks his plot at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.
Carl's brother, Socialist Frank P. Zeidler later became mayor of Milwaukee from 1948 to 1960.
Carl Zeidler was known as the "Singing Mayor of Milwaukee" because wherever he went he always had a song for every meeting or occasion, especially "God Bless America"; he was also called the "Boy Mayor" because of his boyish good looks.

CATEGORIES: Aquatic ecology, Chemical oceanography, Liquid water, Physical oceanography

Seawater or salt water is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, or 599 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately [tpl]convert|35|g|oz[/tpl] of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium ([tpl]chem|Na||+[/tpl]) and chloride ([tpl]chem|Cl||-[/tpl]) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 g/ml. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 g/ml @ [tpl]convert|4|C|F[/tpl]) because the dissolved salts add mass without contributing significantly to the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity it freezes at about [tpl]convert|-2|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/Focus/ocean/water/temp3.htm |title= U.S. Office of Naval Research Ocean, Water: Temperature [/tpl] The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier, and measured [tpl]convert|-2.6|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]Cite web |author= Sylte, Gudrun Urd |title= Den aller kaldaste havstraumen |url= http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2010/mai/250690 |language= Norwegian |date= May 24, 2010 |work= forskning.no |accessdate= May 24, 2010[/tpl] Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4, and the speed of sound in seawater is, on average, roughly 1,500 meters per second.

As a consequence it allows the order of integration to be changed in iterated integrals.
Fubini's theorem implies that the two repeated integrals of a function of two variables are equal if the function is integrable.

It is closely related to the genus Philadelphus. Common names include tree anemone and bush anemone.
It is a rare species, endemic to only seven sites in Fresno and Madera Counties, where it grows in chaparral between [tpl]convert|340|-|1340|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] altitude between the San Joaquin and King rivers. It is well adapted to wildfire, reproducing by stump sprouts after burning; natural seedlings are rare. 
It grows to [tpl]convert|1|-|3|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall, with flaky bark on older stems. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, 4–10 cm long and 1-2.5 cm broad, glossy green above, blue-green to whitish and downy beneath. The flowers are 3–7 cm diameter, with 5-8 pure white petals and a cluster of yellow stamens; flowering is from late spring to mid summer. The fruit is a leathery capsule 6–12 mm diameter, containing numerous seeds.
It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens with Mediterranean climates, grown for its decorative flowers; it is now much more common in cultivation than in the wild. Several cultivars have been selected, including 'Bodnant', a cold-tolerant cultivar hardy to [tpl]convert|-15|C[/tpl] in the British Isles, and 'Ladham's' with large flowers.
The species has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=332

[[Decumaria]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrangeaceae, Flora of North America

Woodvamp (Decumaria) is a genus of two species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae, one (D. barbara) native to the southeastern United States, and the other (D. sinensis) native to central China. 
They are shrubby lianas growing to 4-10 m high through shrubs and trees, climbing by means of aerial adhesive rootlets. The leaves are variably deciduous to evergreen (with D. barbara tending to be more often deciduous, D. sinensis more evergreen), 3-10 cm long, ovate with an acute apex, and a smooth to obscurely toothed margin. The flowers are 5-10 mm diameter, white to creamy colored, fragrant, produced in dense panicles 3-8 cm broad. The fruit is a dry capsule containing several seeds.

By far the highest species diversity is in China, where 50 species occur.
The species are shrubs ranging from [tpl]convert|1|-|4|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in height. Most are deciduous, but a few subtropical species are evergreen. The leaves are opposite, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in panicles or corymbs; they are white in most species, sometimes pink or reddish. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds. Identification of the species is very difficult, requiring often microscopic detail of the leaf hairs and seed capsule structure.
Deutzia is named after the 18th century Dutch patron of botany, Johann van der Deutz.

[[Suburbicarian diocese]]

CATEGORIES: Suburbicarian Sees, College of Cardinals, Types of Christian organization, Titular sees

The seven suburbicarian dioceses are Roman Catholic dioceses located in the vicinity of Rome, whose (titular) bishops form the highest-ranking order of Cardinals, the Cardinal Bishops.
The suburbicarian dioceses have varied slightly over time and nowadays consist of:
The see of Ostia is conferred on the Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to the see he already had. (Until 1914, the Dean received the see of Ostia and Velletri in place of the see he had earlier.  The sees of Ostia and Velletri were separated in 1914.) The Dean used to be the longest-serving cardinal bishop, but is now chosen by the six cardinal bishops with the approval of the pope.
The increasing involvement of the Cardinal bishops in the administration of the papal curia resulted in a detachment from their dioceses. Therefore some of them, in particular the Bishops of Sabina and Velletri, have for centuries had auxiliary bishops and in 1910 Pope Pius X in his constitution Apostolicae Romanorum made this practice obligatory for all suburbicarian dioceses.Catholic Encyclopedia, "Suburbicarian Dioceses", 1913. In 1962, Pope John XXIII in his decree Suburbicarii Sedis turned the Cardinal bishops into mere titular bishops and appointed diocesan bishops for Velletri-Segni, Porto-Santa-Rufina, Frascati, Palestrina, Albano and Sabina. The diocese of Ostia — the titular diocese of the Dean of the College of Cardinals — was merged with the diocese of Rome and was henceforth administered by the Roman vicar general. Though the diocesan bishops exercise all episcopal administrative functions, the Cardinal bishops still formally take possession of their titular dioceses.

[[Il Risorgimento (newspaper)]]

CATEGORIES: Italian-language newspapers, Defunct newspapers of Italy, Publications established in 1847, 1849 disestablishments, Newspapers published in Turin

Il Risorgimento ("The Resurgence" in English) was a liberal, nationalist newspaper founded in Turin 15 December 1847 by Count Camillo Benso di Cavour and Cesare Balbo, who was a backbone of the "neo-Guelph" party that saw in future a rejuvenated Italy under a republican government with a papal presidency—ideas with which Cavour did not agree.  The two men were soon joined by Pietro di Santa Rosa and Michelangelo Castelli, who soon assumed the position of vice-director. Publication began as a result of the relaxation of stringent press control which made the newspaper financially viable.Il Risorgimento cost 0.40 lire, at a time when a Torinese workman's daily wages averaged 1.30 lire. Within weeks the paper, conceived as a weekly, was published daily, as revolutionary events, initiated by an insurgency in Palermo and demonstrations in Genoa, gained momentum. The paper was initiated to form a moderate middle-class "respectable" balance to the more radical "democratic" program of Concordia, which was initiated at the same time. The initial editorial by Cavour made the following claim: "Our aim not being of making money but of enlightening the country and of cooperating with the grand works of "Resurgence" initiated by the government"."lo scopo nostro non essendo di guadagnar quattrini, ma quello di illuminare il paese e di cooperare alla gran opera di Risorgimento cominciata dal governo".  
Thus without seeming to lead, Cavour's Risorgimento offered a regimen of liberal political ideas, of constitutionalism and freedom from foreign control. From its inception, the paper advocated a constitution to be granted by Carlo Alberto of Savoy, the absolute monarch of Sardinia-Piedmont. The eventual constitution was the Statuto Albertino, which was decreed on 8 February 1848. Cavour's editorials were produced with the longer view of preparing Sardinia-Piedmont for a leading role in the coming upheavals, which came to the fore in the revolutionary events of 1848-49.  As editor of the newspaper, Cavour gained a great degree of influence in Sardinian politics; in an editorial on 23 March he pressed for a war to drive the Austrians from Lombardy and Venice, where urban revolutions were under way. This proved disastrous for the kingdom with its overwhelming defeat at the Battle of Novara (1849).
Though he withdrew as editor in October 1848, Il Risorgimento paved Cavour's way towards entering the government—he was appointed prime minister to Vittorio II Emanuele in 1852, after Carlo Alberto's resignation— and a decade's career engineering Italian unification.
In May 1849 Il Risorgimento combined with the more conservative La Nazione, continuing to support government measures.
In the course of the unification of Italy, the term "risorgimento" came to be applied to the process of unification itself.

[[Jamesia]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrangeaceae, Flora of the Southwestern United States, Flora of North America

Jamesia is a genus of shrubs in the Hydrangeaceae, most commonly known as Jamesia, Cliffbush or Waxflower. It is native to interior western North America, in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, growing in mountains at 1600–3000 m altitude.
There is just one species, J. americana, though some botanists[tpl]who|date=December 2012[/tpl] treat it as two species, the second being J. tetrapetala (Fourpetal Cliffbush, with the narrow sense J. americana then known as Fivepetal Cliffbush). 
It is a shrub growing to 1–2 m tall and to 3 m or more broad, with opposite simple leaves 3–7 cm long and 2–5 cm broad, with a serrated margin and a crinkled surface. The flowers are produced in  erect terminal panicles, each flower white, 15–20 mm diameter, with five (rarely four) petals. The fruit is a dry capsule with numerous small seeds.
The genus is named for Edwin James, the botanist for Stephen Long's expedition that explored the territory between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers in 1820. James was the first to collect this genus for botanical study.

Philadelphus, [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|l|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|f|ə|s[/tpl])Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 (mock-orange) is a genus of about 60 species of shrubs from 1 to 6 m tall, native to North America, Central America, Asia and (locally) in southeast Europe. 
They are named "mock-orange" in reference to their flowers, which in wild species look somewhat similar to those of oranges and lemons (Citrus) at first glance, and smell of orange flowers and jasmine (Jasminum). But Philadelphus is a basal asterid, not closely related to Jasminum (advanced asterids), and among the eudicots quite distant indeed from Citrus (advanced rosids). An entirely misleading name for Philadelphus that is sometimes encountered is syringa;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Idaho/flower_syringa.html|title=State Symbols USA: Idaho State Flower[/tpl] this properly refers to the lilacs, which are fairly close relatives of jasmine. The connection of the two shrubs lies in their introduction from Ottoman gardens to European ones, effected at the same time by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, who returned to Vienna in 1562. The two shrubs appear together in John Gerard's Herball, as "Blew Pipe" (the lilac) and "White Pipe Tree", for the wood of both is pithy and easily hollowed out.Alice M. Coats, Garden Plants and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. "Philadelphus".
Philadelphus is named after an ancient Greek king of Egypt, Ptolemy II Philadelphus.

West Florida was a region on the north shore of the Gulf of Mexico, which underwent several boundary and sovereignty changes during its history. The province was established by the British in 1763 out of lands ceded from the Spanish and French. As its name suggests, it was formed out of the Western part of formerly Spanish Florida (East Florida formed the eastern part), along with lands taken from French Louisiana, with its capital at Pensacola. It included most of what is now the Florida Panhandle, plus parts of the modern U.S. states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
Britain formed West and East Florida out of land taken from France and Spain after the French and Indian War. As the newly acquired territory was too large to govern from one administrative center, the British divided it into two new colonies separated by the Apalachicola River. British West Florida's government was based in Pensacola, and the colony included the part of formerly Spanish Florida west of the Apalachicola, plus the parts of French Louisiana taken by the British. It thus comprised all territory between the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers, with a northern boundary that shifted several times over the subsequent years.
Both West and East Florida remained loyal to the British crown during the American Revolution, and served as havens for Tories fleeing from the Thirteen Colonies. Spain invaded West Florida and captured Pensacola in 1781, and after the war Britain ceded both Floridas to Spain. However, the lack of defined boundaries led to a series of border disputes between Spanish West Florida and the fledgling United States known as the West Florida Controversy. Disagreements with the Spanish government led American and English settlers between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers to declare that area the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810. This was soon annexed by the United States, which claimed the region as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. In 1819 the United States negotiated the purchase of the remainder of West Florida and all of East Florida in the Adams–Onís Treaty, and both were merged into the Florida Territory.

[[East Florida]]

CATEGORIES: Former regions and territories of the United States, Pre-statehood history of Florida, Colonial United States (British), Colonial United States (Spanish), Spanish colonization of the Americas, States and territories disestablished in 1822

East Florida was a colony of Great Britain from 1763 to 1783 and province of Spanish Florida from 1783 to 1822. East Florida was established by the British colonial government in 1763; as its name implies it consisted of the eastern part of the region of Florida, with West Florida comprising the western parts. Its capital was St. Augustine, which had been the capital of Spanish Florida.
Britain formed East and West Florida out of territory it had received from Spain and France following the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War). Finding its new acquisitions in the southeast too large to administer as a single unit, the British divided them into two colonies separated by the Apalachicola River. East Florida comprised the bulk of what had previously been the Spanish territory of Florida. Britain ceded both Floridas back to Spain following the American Revolutionary War, and Spain maintained them as separate colonies, though the majority of West Florida was gradually annexed by the United States. Spain ceded East Florida and the remainder of West Florida to the US in the Adams-Onís Treaty; the United States organised them as a single unit, the Florida Territory.

The Apple IIc, the fourth model in the Apple II series of personal computers, is Apple Computer’s first endeavor to produce a portable computer. The result was a [tpl]convert|7.5|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] notebook-sized version of the Apple II that could be transported from place to place. The c in the name stood for compact, referring to the fact it was essentially a complete Apple II computer setup (minus display and power supply) squeezed into a small notebook-sized housing. While sporting a built-in floppy drive and new rear peripheral expansion ports integrated onto the main logic board, it lacked the internal expansion slots and direct motherboard access of earlier Apple IIs, making it a closed system like the Macintosh. However, that was the intended direction for this model — a more appliance-like machine, ready to use out of the box, requiring no technical know-how or experience to hook up and therefore attractive to first-time users.

Pascual Cervera y Topete (February 18, 1839 – April 3, 1909) served as an admiral (almirante) of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron during the Spanish-American War, and prior to this served his country in a variety of military and political roles.
Born at Medina-Sidonia, Cervera was a highly decorated veteran of the Spanish Navy, and served with some distinction during the Carlist Wars before retiring from the active service to act as head of Spain's Ministerio de Marina, the bureaucratic body that governed the naval and merchant marine forces of Spain. During his tenure, Cervera attempted a number of far-reaching reforms to make right what he called the numerous evils of Spanish naval administration at the time.
In 1896, Cervera resigned his position in disgust when a number of reforms put in place were overturned by vote-hungry politicians supported by sycophantic officers who were hungry for his job. After two years of isolation, Cervera was called back to service in the fleet, through the personal intercession of the Queen Regent and began a reorganisation of the vessels under his command, determined at least to bring the fleet to fighting shape before the now inevitable war with the United States of America erupted.
When war with America broke out, Cervera found himself given orders to sail immediately to the Caribbean and break the U.S. blockade. Despite a desperate plea for time to re-fit and to await the completion of badly needed reinforcing vessels, Cervera was immediately dispatched to Cuba. Despite a brilliant circumnavigation of U.S. naval forces, Cervera simply did not have the firepower to engage the might of the United States fleet. Foolish advertisement of his position in Cuba by the Spanish government of that island endangered a plan by Cervera to isolate the U.S. fleet in sections, and doomed his command to destruction.
On July 3, 1898, Cervera's fleet attempted to leave the safety of Santiago de Cuba and run the American blockade. The Battle of Santiago de Cuba was heroically fought by the Spanish sailors under Cervera's command, but the end result was a nearly foregone conclusion. After the destruction of his fleet, Cervera was briefly imprisoned at Camp Long in the United States with his surviving officers before being returned to Spain. Here, he stood trial for the loss of his command, but compelling testimony by Cervera's staff forced the court to recognize that the defeat of the fleet was not the fault of its men, but of politicians.
Thereafter, Cervera lived the rest of his life quietly. He remained loyal to the crown, and never held it responsible for his defeat, blaming instead the corrupting influence of "Parliamentary procedure" for his ultimate defeat. Cervera died in 1909, but remains a national hero in Spain.

[[Box kite]]

CATEGORIES: Australian inventions, Kites

A box kite is a high performance kite, noted for developing relatively high lift; it is a type within the family of cellular kites. The typical design has four parallel struts. The box is made rigid with diagonal crossed struts. There are two sails, or ribbons, whose width is about a quarter of the length of the box. The ribbons wrap around the ends of the box, leaving the ends and middle of the kite open. In flight, one strut is the bottom, and the bridle is tied between the top and bottom of this strut. The dihedrals of the sails help stability.
The box kite was invented in 1893 by Lawrence Hargrave,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=253930|title=The Powerhouse Museum[/tpl] an Englishman who emigrated to Australia, as part of his attempt to develop a manned flying machine. Hargrave linked several of his box kites (Hargrave cells) together, creating sufficient lift for him to fly some 16 ft (4.9 m) off the ground.Hudson Shaw, W. and Ruhen, O. (1977) Lawrence Hargrave: Explorer, Inventor and Aviation Experimenter Sydney : Cassell Australia. A winged development of this kite is known as the Cody kite following its development by Samuel Franklin Cody. Military uses also involved a kite/radio transmitter combination issued to pilots during World War II for use in liferafts.
Large box kites are constructed as cellular kites. Rather than one box, there are many, each with its own set of sails.
Most of the altitude records for kite flying are held by large box kites, with Dacron sails, flown with Spectra cable.  Before Dacron, Spectra and Kevlar were available, high performance box kites used oiled silk, linen or hemp sails, and were flown with steel cable. Silk, linen and hemp were used because they could be spun finer than cotton and stretched relatively little when wet. Steel had the highest available strength for its weight.

[[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale]]
CATEGORIES: Hazard scales, Tropical cyclone meteorology, Wind, Atlantic hurricanes, Pacific hurricanes

The Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), or the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS) for short, classifies hurricanes[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Western Hemisphere tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical storms[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds. To be classified as a hurricane, a tropical cyclone must have maximum sustained winds of at least [tpl]convert|74|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl] (Category 1). The highest classification in the scale, Category 5, is reserved for storms with winds exceeding [tpl]convert|156|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
The classifications can provide some indication of the potential damage and flooding a hurricane will cause upon landfall.
Officially, the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale is used only to describe hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line. Other areas use different scales to label these storms, which are called "cyclones" or "typhoons", depending on the area.
There is some criticism of the SSHS for not taking rain, storm speed, and other important factors into consideration, but SSHS defenders say that part of the goal of SSHS is to be straightforward and simple to understand.

[[National Hurricane Center]]

CATEGORIES: National Weather Service, Tropical cyclone meteorology, Florida International University, Atlantic hurricanes, Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres, National Centers for Environmental Prediction

The National Hurricane Center (NHC), located at Florida International University in Miami, Florida, is the division of the United States' National Weather Service responsible for tracking and predicting weather systems within the tropics between the Prime Meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast Pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern Atlantic ocean.  Its Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB) routinely issues marine forecasts, in the form of graphics and high seas forecasts, for this area year round, with the Ocean Prediction Center having backup responsibility for this unit.  The Technology and Science Branch (TSB) provides technical support for the center, which includes new infusions of technology from abroad.  The Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (CARCAH) unit tasks planes, for research and operational purposes, to tropical cyclones during the Atlantic hurricane season and significant weather events, including snow storms, during winter and spring.  Research conducted to improve operational forecasts is done through the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) and Joint Hurricane Test Bed (JHT) initiatives.
During the Atlantic and northeast Pacific hurricane seasons, the Hurricane Specialists Unit (HSU) issues routine tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans.  When tropical storm or hurricane conditions are expected within 48 hours, the center issues the appropriate watches and warnings via the news media and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio. Although the NHC is an agency of the United States, the World Meteorological Organization has designated it as Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific, making it the central clearinghouse for all tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas.  If the center loses power or becomes incapacitated in some manner, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific ocean while the Weather Prediction Center backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the north Atlantic ocean.

Previously he was Prime Minister of Mauritius from 1982 to 1995 and again from 2000 to 2003. He is the patriarch of the Jugnauth Family of Mauritius.
He served four consecutive terms as Prime Minister from 1982 to 1995 and was then voted out of office from 1995 to 2000. He was the prime minister who held the office for the longest run, one of 16 years, overtaking Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, who held the office for 14 years. As leader of the Militant Socialist Movement, he became Prime Minister again, for a fifth term, after the 2000 election. His alliance partner, Paul Bérenger of the Mauritian Militant Movement, succeeded him in 2003 after serving as Jugnauth's deputy for three years. Jugnauth was then elected President in 2003. He was a Member of Parliament for 35 years, from 1963 to 1995 and from 2000 to 2003. Often nicknamed as Rambo (a film character known to be unbeatable), in Mauritian politics, he is known as such for his personality as he is the only prime minister who won four general parliamentary elections in a row, those in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991.http://www.5plusltd.com/archive/2002/septembre/01_09_2002/annees.htm He is also the only Mauritian who has served as Leader of the Opposition, Prime Minister and President of the country.

He was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn. He was a cabinet minister during the leadership of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam from 1965 up to 1969. In 1970, he moved out and went to the newly created political party of the Mauritian Militant Movement, where he eventually became its leader in 1982. He created his own political party called Militant Socialist Movement in 1983 and was once more elected. His party remained in power up to 1995. In 2000, he was once more elected prime minister and served until 2003, when he was sworn into the presidency. From the beginning of his first mandate as Prime Minister he expressed his country's readiness to establish strong economic ties, particularly in creating technology-based projects with economic feasibility. Jugnauth is credited with the legacy of Mauritius’ "economic miracle" [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] of the 1980s - a set of policies such as the revitalization of the duty-free trade zone and establishing Mauritius as a leader in textiles production - which allowed the island to develop an economic presence in the region.http://www.mauritiusgazette.com/article-Profile-50-
He founded the Militant Socialist Movement party in 1983.http://www.msmparty.org/about-us/founder.aspx He was elected as prime minister in 1982 for the first time, again in 1983, and for the third time from 1991 to 1995. He was honoured with Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards for his continued support for India's causes and concerns and for strengthening India's relationship with Mauritius. He has expressed his country's readiness to establish strong economic ties, particularly in creating technology-based projects. He was elected in 2000 to his final tenure as Prime Minister up to 2003 where he retired from his office.
He was made Queen's Counsel in 1980 and was made a member Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council in 1983. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1988 when Mauritius was still a Commonwealth realm and the Queen was nominal Head of State. Therefore, he still uses his formal title of Sir Anerood and also the prefix used by Privy Councillors, The Right Honourable. His name is often abbreviated as 'SAJ' being the initials of Sir Anerood Jugnauth. Anerood Jugnauth is the only Mauritian to have occupied the two highest position in the republic; the office of the president and prime minister.
Sir Anerood Jugnauth resigned as President on 30 March 2012. He mentioned that he did not support the government policies and new speech program that was to be revealed on 16 April 2012. He stated that he resigned because of his disagreement with the members of the government.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/03/20123309833263960.htmlhttp://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Mauritius-president-quits-in-row-with-PM-20120330http://www.grandbaie.mu/2012/03/sir-anerood-jugnauth-demissionne-comme-president-de-la-republique-de-lile-maurice/

It was formerly the senior partner of the governing Red-Green Coalition, and its leader, Jens Stoltenberg, is the former Prime Minister of Norway.
The Labour Party is officially committed to social-democratic ideals. Its slogan since the 1930s has been "everyone shall take part", and the party traditionally seeks a strong welfare state, funded through taxes and duties.Arbeiderpartiet - Ørnen i Norge - Partiene - NRK Nyheter Since the 1980s, the party has included more of the principles of a social market economy in its policy, allowing for privatisation of government-held assets and services and reducing income tax progressivity, following the wave of economic liberalisation in the 1980s. During the first Stoltenberg government, the party's policies were inspired by Tony Blair's New Labour and saw the most widespread privatisation by any Norwegian government to that date.Avskjed mellom linjene, Aftenposten The party has frequently been described as increasingly neoliberal since the 1980s, both by political scientists and opponents on the left.Myten om Gros nyliberalisme, Dagbladet The Labour Party profiles itself as a progressive party that subscribes to cooperation on a national as well as international level. Its youth wing is the Workers' Youth League. The party is a full member of the Party of European Socialists and  Progressive Alliance,
and is an observer member of the Socialist International. The Labour Party has always been a strong supporter of Norway's NATO membership and has supported Norwegian membership in the European Union during two referendums. During the Cold War, when then party was in government most of the time, the party closely aligned Norway with the United States at the international level and followed an anti-communist policy at the domestic level, in the aftermath of the 1948 Kråkerøy speech and culminating in Norway being a founding member of NATO in 1949.Haakon Lie, Norsk biografisk leksikon
Founded in 1887, the party steadily increased in support until it became the largest party in Norway in 1927, a position it has held ever since. This year also saw the consolidation of conflicts surrounding the party during the 1920s following its membership in the Comintern from 1919 to 1923. It formed its first government in 1928, and has led the government for all but 16 years since 1935.  From 1945 to 1961, the party had an absolute majority in the Norwegian parliament, the only time this has ever happened in Norwegian history.  During this time, Norway was casually referred to as a "one party state". The domination by the Labour Party, during the 1960s and early 1970s, was initially broken by competition from the left, primarily from the Socialist People's Party. From the end of the 1970s however, the party started to lose voters to the right, leading to a turn to the right for the party under Gro Harlem Brundtland during the 1980s. In 2001 the party achieved its worst electoral results since 1924, forcing it to commit to a co-operation agreement with other parties in order to form a majority government.

It is based on the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter aircraft, but optimized for air-to-ground attack. Unlike the MiG-23, the MiG-27 did not see widespread use outside Russia, as most countries opted for the MiG-23BN and Sukhoi Su-22 instead. It currently only remains in service with the Indian, Kazakh and Sri Lankan Air Forces in the ground attack role. All Russian and Ukrainian MiG-27s have been retired.

[[Archbishopric of Salzburg]]
CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic archbishops of Salzburg, Salzburg, Prince-Bishoprics, Roman Catholic Church in Austria, Bavarian Circle

The Archbishopric of Salzburg was a Prince-Bishopric and state of the Holy Roman Empire for many centuries. The diocese arose from St Peter's Abbey, founded in the German stem duchy of Bavaria about 696 by Saint Rupert at the former Roman city of Iuvavum (Salzburg). 
In the 13th century it reached Imperial immediacy and independency from Bavaria, and remained an ecclesiastical state until its secularisation to the short-lived Electorate of Salzburg in 1803. The Prince-Archbishops had never obtained electoral dignity; actually of the five Prince-archbishoprics of the Holy Roman Empire—with Mainz, Trier and Cologne—Magdeburg and Salzburg got nothing from the Golden Bull of 1356. The last Prince-Archbishop exercising secular authority was Count Hieronymus von Colloredo, an early patron of Salzburg native Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

The Archdiocese of Bremen (also Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen, [tpl]lang-de|Erzbistum Bremen[/tpl], not to be confused with the modern Archdiocese of Hamburg, founded in 1994) was a historical Roman Catholic diocese (787–1566/1648) and formed from 1180 to 1648 an ecclesiastical state (continued under other names until 1823), named Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen ([tpl]lang-de|Erzstift Bremen[/tpl]) within the Holy Roman Empire. The prince-archbishopric consisted of about a third of the diocesan territory. The city of Bremen was de facto (since 1186) and de jure (since 1646) no part of the prince-archbishopric but belonged to the archdiocese. Most of the prince-archbishopric lay rather in the area to the north of the city of Bremen, between the Weser and Elbe rivers. Even more confusingly, parts of the prince-archbishopric belonged in religious respect to the neighbouring diocese of Verden, making up 10% of its diocesan territory.
Verden ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈfeːɐ̯dən[/tpl]) itself had a double identity too—as the diocese of Verden ([tpl]lang-de|Bistum Verden[/tpl]) and the Prince-Bishopric of Verden ([tpl]lang-de|Hochstift Verden[/tpl]). Each prince-bishopric had the status of an Imperial Estate ([tpl]lang-de|Reichsstand[/tpl], plural: [tpl]lang|de|Reichsstände[/tpl]), each of which were represented in the Diet ([tpl]lang-de|Reichstag[/tpl]) of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1500 on the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen belonged to the Saxon Circle (later the Lower Saxon Circle; [tpl]lang-de|Sächsischer[/tpl] or, later. [tpl]lang|de|Niedersächsischer Kreis[/tpl]), an administrative substructure of the Empire. The Prince-Bishopric of Verden, on the other hand, belonged to the Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle ([tpl]lang-de|Niederrheinisch-Westfälischer Kreis[/tpl], colloquially Westphalian Circle) and sent its own representative to the Diet. Even when the two prince-bishoprics were ruled in personal union, in order to maintain the two seats in the Diet they were never formally united in a real union. The same is true for the collectively governed Duchies of Bremen and Verden ([tpl]lang-de|Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden[/tpl] colloquially, but [tpl]lang|de|Herzogtum Bremen und Fürstentum Verden[/tpl] formally) which emerged in 1648 from the secularised two prince-bishoprics.

CATEGORIES: Old World babblers, Timaliidae

The Old World babblers or timaliids are a large family of mostly Old World passerine birds. They are rather diverse in size and coloration, but are characterised by soft fluffy plumage. These are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent.   The timaliids are one of two unrelated groups of birds known as babblers, the other being the Australasian Babblers of the family Pomatostomidae (also known as pseudo-babblers).
Morphological diversity is rather high; most species resemble "warblers", jays or thrushes. This group is among those Old World bird families with the highest number of species still being discovered.

BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Neasden (also commonly known as the Neasden Temple), is a Budhism temple in the London Borough of Brent in south London. Built entirely using traditional methods and materials, Neasden’s Swaminarayan Mandir has been described as being Britain’s first authentic Hindu temple.Spirit of suburbia by Adam Hardy in Perspectives on Architecture – November 1995 Issue 19, Vol. 2 – p. 42 to p. 47 It was also Europe’s first traditional Hindu stone temple, as distinct from converted secular buildings. It is a part of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) organization and was inaugurated on August 20, 1995 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj.
The Mandir was not cited in Guinness World Records 2000,“Biggest Hindu Temple Outside India” – http://www.mandir.org/awards&opinions/Buildings%20and%20structures.htm as follows:
However, it has now been surpassed in size by other BAPS temples elsewhere. The mandir was built and funded entirely by the Hindu community. The entire project spanned five years although the Mandir construction itself was completed in two and a half years. Building work began in August 1992. On 24 November 1992, the temple recorded the biggest-ever concrete-pour in the UK, when 4,500 tons was put down in 24 hours to create a foundation mat 6 ft (1.8m) thick. The first stone was laid in June 1993; two years later, the building was complete.The Eventful 20th Century – 70 Wonders of the Modern World by The Reader’s Digest Association Limited – p. 124 to p. 125

Paul Bruce Dickinson (born 7 August 1958) is an English musician, airline pilot and broadcaster best known as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden.
Dickinson began his career in music fronting small pub bands at school and University, including Styx (not the American band of the same name) in 1976, Speed, (1977–78), and Shots in early 1979. He then joined the band Samson later in 1979, where he gained some popularity under the stage name "Bruce Bruce". He left Samson in 1981 to join Iron Maiden, replacing Paul Di'Anno, and debuted on their 1982 album The Number of the Beast. During his first tenure in the band, they issued a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums in the 1980s, resulting in Dickinson gaining worldwide fame, and becoming one of the most acclaimed heavy metal vocalists of all time.
Dickinson quit Iron Maiden in 1993, being replaced by Blaze Bayley, in order to pursue his solo career which saw him experiment with a wide variety of heavy metal and rock styles. Dickinson rejoined the band in 1999 along with guitarist Adrian Smith, with whom he released four subsequent studio albums. Since his return to Iron Maiden, Dickinson issued one further solo record in 2005, Tyranny of Souls. He is the older cousin of Rob Dickinson, former lead singer of British alternative rock band Catherine Wheel. His son, Austin, is the lead singer in metalcore band Rise to Remain.

Hatter's Castle (1931) is the first novel of author A. J. Cronin. The story is set in 1879, in the fictional town of Levenford, on the Firth of Clyde. The plot revolves around many characters and has many subplots, all of which relate to the life of the hatter, James Brodie, whose narcissism and cruelty gradually destroy his family and life. The book was made into a successful film in 1942 starring Robert Newton, Deborah Kerr, and James Mason.

[[Parrotbill]]

CATEGORIES: Sylviidae

The parrotbills are a group of peculiar birds native to East and Southeast Asia, though feral populations are known from elsewhere. They are generally small, long-tailed birds which inhabit reedbeds and similar habitat. They feed mainly on seeds, e.g. of grasses, to which their bill, as the name implies, is well-adapted. Living in tropical to southern temperate climates, they are usually non-migratory.
The Bearded Reedling or "Bearded Tit", an Eurasian species long placed here, is more insectivorous by comparison, especially in summer. It also strikingly differs in morphology, and was time and again placed in a monotypic family Panuridae. DNA sequence data supports this.
As names like "Bearded Tit" imply, their general habitus and acrobatic habits resemble birds like the Long-tailed tits. Together with these and others they were at some time placed in the titmouse family Paridae. Later studies found no justification to presume a close relationship between all these birds, and consequently the parrotbills and Bearded Reedling were removed from the tits and chickadees and placed into a distinct family, Paradoxornithidae. As names like Paradoxornis paradoxus - "puzzling, paradox bird" - suggest, their true relationships were very unclear, although by the latter 20th century they were generally seen as close to Timaliidae ("Old World babblers") and Sylviidae ("Old World warblers").
Since 1990 (Sibley & Ahlquist 1990),Ricklefs, Robert E. "Small clades at the periphery of passerine morphological space." The American Naturalist 165.6 (2005): 651-659. molecular data has been added to aid the efforts of discovering the parrotbills' true relationships. As Paradoxornis species are generally elusive and in many cases little-known birds, usually specimens of the Bearded Reedling which are far more easy to procure were used for the analyses. Often, the entire group was entirely left out of analyses, being small and seemingly insignificant in the large pattern of bird evolution (e.g. Barker et al. 2002, 2004). The Bearded Reedling tended to appear close to larks in phylogenies based on e.g. DNA-DNA hybridization (Sibley & Ahlquist 1990), or on mtDNA cytochrome b and nDNA c-myc exon 3, RAG-1 and myoglobin intron 2 sequence data (Ericson & Johansson 2003). Placement in a superfamily Sylvioidea which contained birds such as Sylviidae, Timaliidae and long-tailed tits - but not Paridae - was confirmed.
Cibois (2003a) analyzed mtDNA cytochrome b and 12S/16S rRNA sequences of some Sylvioidea, among them several species of Paradoxornis but not the Bearded Reedling. These formed a robust clade closer to the Sylvia typical warblers and some presumed "Old World babblers" such as Chrysomma sinense than to other birds. The puzzle was finally resolved by Alström et al. (2006), who studied mtDNA cytochrome b and nDNA myoglobin intron 2 sequences of a wider range of Sylvioidea: The Bearded Reedling was not a parrotbill at all, but forms a distinct lineage on its own, the relationships of which are not entirely resolved at present. The parrotbills' presence in the clade containing Sylvia, on the other hand, necessitates that the Paradoxornithidae are placed in synonymy of the Sylviidae. Cibois (2003b) even suggested that these themselves were to be merged with the remaining Timaliidae and the latter name to be adopted. This has hitherto not been followed and researchers remain equivocal as many taxa in Sylviidae and Timaliidae remain to be tested for their relationships. In any case, it is most likely that the typical warbler-parrotbill group is monophyletic and therefore agrees with the modern requirements for a taxon. Hence, whether to keep or to synonymize it is entirely a matter of philosophy, as the scientific facts would agree with either approach.
The interesting conclusion from an evolutionary point of view is that the morphologically both internally homogenous and compared to each other highly dissimilar typical warblers and parrotbills form the two extremes in the divergent evolution of the Sylviidae. This is underscored by looking at the closest living relatives of the parrotbills in the rearranged Sylviidae: The genus Chrysomma are non-specialized species altogether intermediate in habitus, habitat and habits between the typical warblers and the parrotbills. Presumably, the ancestral sylviids looked much like these birds. How dramatic the evolutionary changes wrought upon the parrotbills in their adaptation to feeding on grass caryopses and similar seeds were can be seen by comparing them with the typical fulvettas, which were formerly considered Timaliidae and united with the alcippes (Pasquet 2006). These look somewhat like drab fairy-wrens and have none of the parrotbills' adaptations to food and habitat. Yet it appears that the typical fulvettas' and parrotbills' common ancestor evolved into at least two parrotbill lineages independently (Cibois 2003a) & (Yeung et al. 2006). Only the Wrentit, the only American sylviid, resembles the parrotbills much in habitus, though not in color pattern, and of course, as an insectivore, neither in bill shape.

[[Masters and Johnson]]

The Masters and Johnson research team, composed of William H. Masters and Virginia E.

The work of Masters and Johnson began in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University in St. Louis and was continued at the independent not-for-profit research institution they founded in St. Louis in 1964, originally called the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation and renamed the Masters & Johnson Institute in 1978.
In the initial phase of Masters and Johnson's studies, from 1957 until 1965, they recorded some of the first laboratory data on the anatomy and physiology of human sexual response based on direct observation of 382 women and 312 men in what they conservatively estimated to be "10,000 complete cycles of sexual response." Their findings, particularly on the nature of female sexual arousal (for example, describing the mechanisms of vaginal lubrication and debunking the earlier widely held notion that vaginal lubrication originated from the cervix) and orgasm (showing that the physiology of orgasmic response was identical whether stimulation was clitoral or vaginal, and proving that some women were capable of being multiorgasmic), dispelled many long-standing misconceptions. 
They jointly wrote two classic texts in the field, Human Sexual Response and Human Sexual Inadequacy, published in 1966 and 1970, respectively. Both of these books were best-sellers and were translated into more than thirty languages.

[[Thermodynamic potential]]
CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics, Potentials, Fundamental theorems, Thermodynamic equations

A thermodynamic potential is a scalar quantity used to represent the thermodynamic state of a system. The concept of thermodynamic potentials was introduced by Pierre Duhem in 1886. Josiah Willard Gibbs in his papers used the term fundamental functions. One main thermodynamic potential that has a physical interpretation is the internal energy [tpl]mvar|U[/tpl]. It is the energy of configuration of a given system of conservative forces (that is why it is a potential) and only has meaning with respect to a defined set of references (or data). Expressions for all other thermodynamic energy potentials are derivable via Legendre transforms from an expression for [tpl]mvar|U[/tpl]. In thermodynamics, certain forces, such as gravity, are typically disregarded when formulating expressions for potentials. For example, while all the working fluid in a steam engine may have higher energy due to gravity while sitting on top of Mount Everest than it would at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the gravitational potential energy term in the formula for the internal energy would usually be ignored because changes in gravitational potential within the engine during operation would be negligible.

[[Helmholtz free energy]]

CATEGORIES: Concepts in physics, State functions, Thermodynamic free energy

In thermodynamics, the Helmholtz free energy is a thermodynamic potential that measures the “useful” work obtainable from a closed thermodynamic system at a constant temperature. The negative of the difference in the Helmholtz energy is equal to the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process in which temperature is held constant. If the volume is not held constant, part of this work will be performed on the environment. The Helmholtz energy is commonly used for systems held at constant volume. Since in this case no work is performed on the environment, the drop in the Helmholtz energy is equal to the maximum amount of useful work that can be extracted from the system. For a system at constant temperature and volume, the Helmholtz energy is minimized at equilibrium.
The Helmholtz free energy was developed by Hermann von Helmholtz, a German physicist, and is usually denoted by the letter A  (from the German “Arbeit” or work), or the  letter F . The IUPAC recommends the letter A  as well as the use of name Helmholtz energy.[tpl]cite book | title = Gold Book | publisher = IUPAC | url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/H02772.html | accessdate = 2012-08-19 | doi=10.1351/goldbook[/tpl] In physics, the letter F can also be used to denote the Helmholtz energy, as Helmholtz energy is sometimes referred to as the Helmholtz function, Helmholtz free energy, or simply free energy (not to be confused with Gibbs free energy).
While Gibbs free energy is most commonly used as a measure of thermodynamic potential, especially in the field of chemistry, it is inconvenient for some applications that do not occur at constant pressure.  For example, in explosives research, Helmholtz free energy is often used since explosive reactions by their nature induce pressure changes. It is also frequently used to define fundamental equations of state of pure substances.

[[Be star]]
CATEGORIES: Star types, Be stars

A B(e) star is a B-type star with distinctive forbidden neutral or low ionisation emission lines in its spectrum. The designation results from combining the spectral class B and the lowercase e denoting emission in the spectral classification system.  These stars frequently also show strong hydrogen emission lines, but this feature is present in a variety of other stars and is not sufficient to classify a B(e) object.  Other observational characteristics include optical linear polarization and often infrared radiation that is much stronger than in ordinary B-class stars, called infrared excess.  As the Be nature is transient, Be stars might exhibit a normal B-type spectrum at times, and hitherto normal B stars may become Be stars.
While most Be stars are on the main sequence, the identifier actually refers to a heterogeneous group of objects including pre main sequence stars, supergiant stars, protoplanetary nebulae, and others.[tpl]cite journal|bibcode=1998A&A...340..117L|last1=Lamers|first1=Henny J.

The first star recognized as a Be star was Gamma Cassiopeiae, observed 1866 by Angelo Secchi, the first star ever observed with emission lines. With the understanding of the processes of emission line formation in the early 20th century it became clear that these lines must come from the circumstellar environment, not from the star itself. Nowadays, all the observational characteristics are explained with a gaseous disk that is formed of material ejected from the star. The infrared excess and the polarization result from the scattering of stellar light in the disk, while the line emission is formed by re-processing stellar ultraviolet light in the gaseous disc.
The forbidden emission, infrared excess, and other features indicative of the B(e) phenomenon, themselves provide strong hints at the nature of the stars.  These are produced from circumstellar discs of material, most likely ejected or stripped from the stars themselves.  B(e) stars frequently rotate rapidly, which has been confirmed by interferometric measurements of the rotational distortion of Achernar.[ref]
Kervella, P.; Domiciano de Souza, A., Astronomy and Astrophysics, Volume 453, Issue 3, July III 2006, pp.1059–1066,(DOI 10.1051/0004-6361:20054771)[/ref] However, rotation alone is probably not sufficient to form the disk, but an additional ejection mechanism is required, such as a magnetic field or nonradial stellar pulsation. The transient nature of the Be phenomenon is most likely connected to the nature of that secondary process, but the details are currently still being discussed.  The heterogeneous nature of the group of B(e) stars suggest a heterogeneous mechanism for formation of the discs.  Many supergiant B(e) stars have been shown to be involved in binary systems where the companion may contribute to periodic ejection of material, or are unstable highly luminous stars which have continuum driven winds.
Be stars are typically variable and can either be classified as Gamma Cassiopeiae variable due to the transient nature of the disk and the scattering processes, or as Lambda Eridani variable on account of their pulsational nature.

Rangitoto Island is a volcanic island in the Hauraki Gulf near Auckland, New Zealand. The 5.5 km wide island is an iconic and widely visible landmark of Auckland with its distinctive symmetrical shield volcano cone rising 260 metres (850 ft) high over the Hauraki Gulf.[tpl]cite gvp | vnum=0401-02=&volpage=photos | title=Auckland Field – Photo Gallery | accessdate=2008-06-21[/tpl][tpl]cite gvp | vnum=0401-02 | title=Auckland Field | accessdate=2009-04-29[/tpl] Rangitoto is the most recent and the largest (2311 hectares) of the approximately 50 volcanoes of the Auckland volcanic field. It is separated from the mainland of Auckland's North Shore by the Rangitoto Channel. Since World War II it has been linked by a causeway to the much older, non-volcanic Motutapu Island.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nzine.co.nz/features/rangitoto.html |title=Rangitoto – Auckland's Fragile Icon |publisher=NZine |accessdate=26 April 2010|first=Jacqueline Crompton|last=Ottaway|date=30 April 2004 [/tpl]
Rangitoto is Māori for 'Bloody Sky',What happened to local Maori?

[[Excretion]]
CATEGORIES: Digestive system, Metabolism, Excretion

Excretion is the process by which waste products of metabolism and other non-useful materials are eliminated from an organism. In vertebrates this is primarily carried out by the lungs, kidneys and skin.[tpl]cite book | last = Beckett | first = B. S. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Biology: A Modern Introduction | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1987 | location = | pages = 110 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-19-914260-2 [/tpl] This is in contrast with secretion, where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the cell. Excretion is an essential process in all forms of life. In humans urine is carried out through the urethra and that is part of the excretory system.
In single-celled organisms, waste products are discharged directly through the surface of the cell.
Plants produce carbon dioxide and water as respiratory waste products. In green plants, the carbon dioxide released during respiration gets utilized during photosynthesis.  Oxygen can be thought of as a waste product generated during photosynthesis, and exits through stomata, root cell walls, and other routes.  Plants can get rid of excess water by transpiration and guttation. It has been shown that the leaf acts as an 'excretophore' and, in addition to being a green plant's primary organ of photosynthesis, is also used as the plant's method of excreting toxic wastes. Other waste materials that are exuded by some plants — resin, saps, latex, etc. are forced from the interior of the plant by hydrostatic pressures inside the plant and by absorptive forces of plant cells. These latter processes do not need added energy, they act passively. However, during the pre-abscission phase, the metabolic levels of a leaf are high.Ford BJ, Even Plants Excrete, Nature 323 p763, 1986"excretion." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010 Plants also excrete some waste substances into the soil around them.Tutorvista.com
In animals, the main excretory products are carbon dioxide, ammonia (in ammoniotelics), urea (in ureotelics), uric acid (in uricotelics), guanine (in Arachnida) and creatine.
Aquatic animals usually excrete ammonia directly into the external environment, as this compound has high solubility and there is ample water available for dilution. In terrestrial animals ammonia-like compounds are converted into other nitrogenous materials as there is less water in the environment and ammonia itself is toxic.
Birds excrete their nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of a paste. This is metabolically more expensive, but allows more efficient water retention and it can be stored more easily in the egg. Many avian species, especially seabirds, can also excrete salt via specialized nasal salt glands, the saline solution leaving through nostrils in the beak.
In insects, a system involving Malpighian tubules is utilized to excrete metabolic waste. Metabolic waste diffuses or is actively transported into the tubule, which transports the wastes to the intestines. The metabolic waste is then released from the body along with fecal matter.
The excreted material may be called dejecta or ejecta.Oliver and Boyd (1887) The Transactions of the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society, Volume 12, p.169 In pathology the word ejecta is more commonly used.ejecta.

[[Arndt Pekurinen]]

CATEGORIES: 1905 births, 1941 deaths, People from Juva, Nonviolence advocates, People executed by single firearm, Finnish conscientious objectors, Finnish Christian pacifists, Finnish people executed by firearm, People executed by Finland by firearm

Arndt Juho Pekurinen (29 August 1905 in Juva, Finland – 5 November 1941 in Kalevala district, Soviet Union, now Russia) was a Finnish pacifist and conscientious objector.
In 1926, Pekurinen repeatedly refused mandatory conscription, leading to his imprisonment between 1929 and 1931. He refused to either wear a uniform or take arms. While Pekurinen was deeply religious, his motives were not based on his faith. While his contemporaries suggested he was Communist, he was not interested in politics. Because of his pacifist conviction, in the atmosphere of the Militaristic thirties he was deemed as guilty of high treason, and the Lapua movement harassed him relentlessly. In 1930, an international petition on his behalf was sent to the Finnish defense minister Juho Niukkanen, which included the signatures of sixty British MPs and notables such as Albert Einstein, Henri Barbusse and H. G. Wells. On 14 April 1931, the Lex Pekurinen, Finland's first alternative to military service, was passed. However, its provisions extended only as far as peacetime.
When the Winter War broke out in 1939, therefore, Pekurinen once again found himself imprisoned. At the onset of the Continuation War in autumn 1941, he was sent to the front, with orders to make sure he did wear the uniform, and bear and use a weapon. At the front he still refused to wear a uniform or bear arms. Following an order issued by Captain Pentti Valkonen, he was executed without trial. The first two soldiers (Sergeant Kivelä and Private Kinnunen) ordered to execute him refused; only the third, Corporal Asikainen, obeyed Valkonen's direct order. 
After the war, an investigation of Pekurinen's death was begun but never completed. He remained effectively forgotten for over fifty years, until the publication in 1998 of the book Courage: The life and execution of Arndt Pekurinen by Erno Paasilinna. The city of Helsinki named a park Arndt Pekurisen puisto (The park of Arndt Pekurinen) in his memory.
According to the book by Erno Paasilinna, Pekurinen's motto was inspired by Jonathan Swift: "As people are not eaten, butchering them is of no use." ("Kun ihmisiä ei syödä, on niitä turha teurastaa.")

[[Amazing Stories]]

CATEGORIES: Publications established in 1926, Science fiction magazines established in the 1920s, Publications disestablished in 2006, Pulp magazines, Defunct science fiction magazines of the United States, Wizards of the Coast magazines, Amazing Stories

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]thumb|right|First issue of Amazing Stories, art by Frank R. Paul. This copy was autographed by Hugo Gernsback in 1965.Amazing Stories was an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing.  It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction.  Before Amazing, science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but Amazing helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.
Amazing was published, with some interruptions, for almost eighty years.  The title first changed hands in 1929, when Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and lost control of the magazine.  In 1931, Bernarr Macfadden purchased the assets of the Mackinnon-Fly magazine publishers (in Canada), which gave him the pioneering sci-fi pulp Amazing Stories and several other titles. They were published under the Teck Publications imprint. Amazing became unprofitable during the 1930s and in 1938 was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing began to print stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros. The stories were presented as fact, and led to dramatically increased circulation but also widespread ridicule.  Palmer was replaced by Howard Browne in 1949, who briefly entertained plans of taking Amazing upmarket.  These plans came to nothing, though Amazing did switch to a digest format in 1953, shortly before the end of the pulp-magazine era.  A brief period under the editorship of Paul W. Fairman was followed, at the end of 1958, by the leadership of Cele Goldsmith.  Despite her lack of experience she was able to bring new life to the magazine, and her years are regarded as one of Amazing's most creative eras.  She was unable to arrest the declining circulation, though, and the magazine was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965.
Under Cohen Amazing was filled almost entirely with reprinted stories.  Cohen did not pay a reprint fee to the authors of these stories, and this brought him into conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America.  The conflict cost Amazing two successive editors (Harry Harrison and Barry N. Malzberg) in a short period at the end of the 1960s.  Ted White took over as editor after Malzberg, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine a respected name again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo award three times during his tenure.   White left at the end of the 1970s.  The 1980s saw Amazing pass into the hands of TSR in 1983 and Wizards of the Coast (who purchased TSR in 1997), who made intermittent attempts over the next twenty years to create a successful modern incarnation of the magazine.  A last attempt was made by Paizo Publishing at the end of 2004, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue.
By 2008 Hasbro (which purchased Wizards of the Coast in 1999[tpl]cite web|title=Hasbro Buys Pokeman Cards|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffindarticles.com%2Fp%2Farticles%2Fmi_m0FVE%2Fis_18_4%2Fai_55766122&date=2008-06-13[/tpl] ) had allowed the trademarks to expire.  Application for the trademarks was made in 2008 and granted to Steve Davidson in September 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Amazing Stories Trademark Acquired|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2011/09/amazing-stories-trademark-acquired/|publisher=Locus Magazine[/tpl] Publication of the magazine was then resumed[tpl]cite web|title=Amazing Stories Reboot Offered|url=http://boingboing.net/2012/08/12/amazing-stories-reboo.html|publisher=BoingBoing.Net[/tpl]  in July, 2012 with the first of two 'relaunch prelaunch' issues (Volume 0) (July & August), featuring reprinted and excerpted fiction, new and reprinted non-fiction articles, art galleries and interviews, including works by Robert Silverberg, Barry Malzberg, Patrick L. Price and David A. Hardy.  Amazing Stories is scheduled to begin regular publication as a professional online magazine sometime in 2013.
Gernsback's initial editorial approach was to blend instruction with entertainment; he believed science fiction could educate readers.  His audience rapidly showed a preference for implausible adventures, however, and the movement away from Gernsback's idealism accelerated when the magazine changed hands in 1929.  Despite this, Gernsback had an enormous impact on the field: the creation of a specialist magazine for science fiction spawned an entire genre publishing industry.  The letter columns in Amazing, where fans could make contact with each other, led to the formation of science fiction fandom, which in turn had a strong influence on the development of the field.  Writers whose first story was published in the magazine include Isaac Asimov, Howard Fast, Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, and Thomas M. Disch.  Overall, though, Amazing itself was rarely an influential magazine within the genre.  Some critics have commented that by "ghettoizing" science fiction, Gernsback in fact did harm to its literary growth, but this viewpoint has been countered by the argument that science fiction needed an independent market to develop in to reach its potential.

[[Stress management]]

CATEGORIES: Stress, Management, Psychotherapy, Psychiatric treatments

Stress management refers to the wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's levels of stress, especially chronic stress, usually for the purpose of improving everyday functioning.
In this context, the term 'stress' refers only to a stress with significant negative consequences, or distress in the terminology advocated by Hans Selye, rather than what he calls eustress, a stress whose consequences are helpful or otherwise positive.
Stress produces numerous symptoms which vary according to persons, situations, and severity. These can include physical health decline as well as depression.  The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | title=Stress Management: What can you do? | publisher=St. Louis Psychologists and Counseling Information and Referral | accessdate=February 5, 2013 | author=Paul Susic MA Licensed Psychologist    Ph.D Candidate[/tpl] Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.
Despite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measureable using various physiological tests, similar to those used in polygraphs.
Many practical stress management techniques are available, some for use by health practitioners and others for self-help, which may help an individual to reduce stress, provide positive feelings of being in control of one's life and promote general well-being.
The effectiveness of the different stress management techniques can be difficult to assess, as few of them have received significant attention from researchers.  Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely.  Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in psychotherapy, whilst others with less evidence favouring them are considered alternative therapies.  Many professional organisations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies.
There are several models of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress.  Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.

Hrothgar ([tpl]lang-ang|Hroðgar[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-on|Hróarr[/tpl]) was a legendary Danish king, living in the early 6th century.The dating has never been a matter of controversy. It is inferred from the internal chronology of the sources themselves and the dating of Hygelac's raid on Frisia to c. 516. It is also supported by archaeological excavations of the barrows of Eadgils and Ohthere in Sweden. For a discussion, see e.g. Birger Nerman's Det svenska rikets uppkomst (1925) (in Swedish). For presentations of the archaeological findings, see e.g. Elisabeth Klingmark's Gamla Uppsala, Svenska kulturminnen 59, Riksantikvarieämbetet (in Swedish), or this English language presentation by the Swedish National Heritage Board
Hrothgar appears in the Anglo-Saxon epics Beowulf and Widsith, and also in Norse sagas, Norse poems, and medieval Danish chronicles. In both Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian tradition, Hrothgar is a Scylding, the son of Healfdene, the brother of Halga, and the uncle of Hroðulf. Moreover, in both traditions, the mentioned characters were the contemporaries of the Swedish king Eadgils; and both traditions also mention a feud with men named Froda and Ingeld. The consensus view is that Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian traditions describe the same person.Shippey, T. A.: Wicked Queens and Cousin Strategies in Beowulf and Elsewhere, Notes and Bibliography.

In 1960 his first book for children was published with George Lentz, who was a friend of his, who also persuaded him to take on the penname Janosch. Within the next 10 years numerous books for children followed with different publishing houses.
He also published books for adults, in which he deals with his childhood experiences of growing up with an abusive father and a God-fearing mother, constantly recurring topics being friendship, family relationships and the quest for the meaning of life.
Among others, he has received the following awards:
By 1980 he had published over 100 books for children in nearly 30 languages. By then he had left Germany and now lives on the island of Tenerife in the Atlantic Ocean.

LGV is primarily an infection of lymphatics and lymph nodes. Chlamydia trachomatis is the bacterium responsible for LGV. It gains entrance through breaks in the skin, or it can cross the epithelial cell layer of mucous membranes.

Gérard Bessette (Sainte-Anne-de-Sabrevois, Quebec, 25 February 1920 – Kingston, Ontario, 21 February 2005) was a French Canadian writer and educator.
Bessette grew up in Montreal and attended the Collège Saint-Ignace. He continued his studies at the Université de Montréal, where in 1950 he completed his doctorate entitled Images in French-Canadian poetry.
Unable to obtain an academic position in Quebec because of his atheism, he taught at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh from 1951–1957. He then found a job in Kingston, Ontario, first at Royal Military College of Canada in 1958, and then in the Department of French Studies at Queen's University from 1959 to 1979. Bessette's novel Le cycle (1971) won the Governor General's Award, and in 1980 he was awarded the Prix Athanase-David, Quebec's highest literary honour.
Several of Bessette's works address issues that led to and were representative of the Révolution tranquille, a series of societal shifts that took place in Quebec during the 1960s, which saw increased secularization and a general movement away from the influence of the Catholic Church. His earlier works are written in a realistic style, while his later novels utilize elements of the nouveau roman literary movement and tend to be more experimental. His literary criticism is noted for its Freudian readings of Québécois literature.
One of his most noted works is Le libraire (1960), an existential tale of a book store employee in a small Quebec town in the 1950s. The book deals with one of Bessette's most common themes: the stifling culture of Quebec of that time.

Gravity's Rainbow is a 1973 novel by American writer Thomas Pynchon.
A lengthy, complex novel featuring a large cast of characters, its narrative is set primarily in Europe at the end of World War II and centers on the design, production and dispatch of V-2 rockets by the German military, and, in particular, the quest undertaken by several characters to uncover the secret of a mysterious device named the "Schwarzgerät" ("black device") that is to be installed in a rocket with the serial number "00000".
Traversing an immense range of knowledge, the novel transgresses boundaries between high and low culture, between literary propriety and profanity, and between science and speculative metaphysics.
The novel shared the 1974 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction with A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer.[ref]

Warren Defever (first name often spelled Warn; born April 30, 1969) is a musician and producer originally from Livonia, Michigan now based in Detroit. He is most known for his chameleonic project His Name Is Alive,[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13202/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography: His Name Is Alive|last=Phares|first=Heather|publisher=AMG|accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl] though he is active in numerous other circles. He produced, engineered, and or remixed recordings by Iggy and the Stooges, Blanche, Low, Ida, Michael Hurley,  Califone, Yoko Ono, Thurston Moore, the Gories, the Go, Nomo, Saturday Looks Good to Me, Faruq Z. Bey, the Von Bondies, Reba Fritz, Destroy All Monsters, Jenny Toomey, Slumber Party, John Sinclair, Elizabeth Mitchell & Lisa Loeb, as well as HNIA offshoot Velour 100.
Defever was born in Livonia, Michigan to Charles Defever, who is American, and Grace Kloschinsky, who was a Canadian citizen.123 Defever was raised in a strict religious household along with his brothers, Johnny and Matt. He grew up a music fan. His grandfather, John Kloschinsky, was a musician from Saskatchewan and had taught Warren and his brothers how to play various musical instruments.[tpl]cite news|last=Handyside|first=Chris|title=Music: Back from hell|url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=6673|accessdate=1 January 2012|newspaper=Metro Times|date=1 September 2004[/tpl] Defever has spoken of him often in interviews saying, "I was so young I can barely even remember, but I have a hazy vision of having to hold a giant accordion on my lap when I was only two. It's one of my earliest and worst memories.  That's probably why I hate music." The Defever family spent many years travelling back and forth between the U.S. and Canada before eventually settling outside of Detroit near the Canadian border. Defever's early life was marked by a multitude of physical maladies; he suffered collapsed lungs twice, had pneumonia 4-5 times, a burst appendix, a cyst on his tonsils and asthma. This served to isolate him from other children at school because, as he claims, he was in the hospital so often that no one knew him well enough to befriend him.  He has revealed recently in a radio interview in Detroit on WDET that his health finally improved, however, once the family settled in Livonia.
Defever began recording while still in high school, and toured as the bassist of psychobilly rock band Elvis Hitler. He attended Eastern Michigan University for one year, but dropped out to concentrate on music. His classmate Karin Oliver provided vocals for His Name Is Alive until 1998, and on Velour 100's second album.
For many years Defever recorded in the basement of his parents' house, which he later bought from them. There he produced a number of bands, including Godzuki and Tarnation.
In 2003, Defever opened his own recording studio, Brown Rice, in the Detroit area, where he works as a producer. Along with Davin Brainard, Defever runs a home record label, timeSTEREO.
In 2007, Defever opened a new studio in Detroit called THE UFO FACTORY.  Everything inside is spray painted silver.

[[Piculet]]

CATEGORIES: Picumninae

The piculets are a distinctive subfamily of small woodpeckers which occur mainly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African  species.
Like the true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues which they use to extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, but they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.
Their bills are shorter and less dagger-like than  the true woodpeckers, so they look for insects and grubs mainly in decaying wood. Similarly, they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.
Typically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.

They re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.
The two species have cryptic plumage, with intricate patterning of greys and browns. The voice is a nasal woodpecker-like call.

[[Ynglinga saga]]

CATEGORIES: Kings' sagas, Sources of Norse mythology, 1220s books

Ynglinga saga is a legendary saga, originally written in Old Norse by the Icelandic poet and historian Snorri Sturluson about 1225. It is the first section of his Heimskringla. It was first translated into English and published in 1844 by Samuel Laing.
Snorri Sturluson based his work on an earlier Ynglingatal which is attributed to the Norwegian 9th century skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, and which also appears in Historia Norwegiae.   It tells the most ancient part of the story of the House of Ynglings (Scylfings in Beowulf). Snorri described the descent of the kings of Norway from this royal house of Sweden.
Ynglinga saga is the first part of Snorri's history of the ancient Norse kings, the Heimskringla.  Snorri's work covers the history of the Norwegian kings from the mythical prehistoric age until the year 1177, with the death of the pretender Eystein Meyla. Interwoven in this narrative are a number of references to important historical events. 
The saga deals with the arrival of the Norse gods to Scandinavia and how Freyr founded the Swedish Yngling dynasty at Uppsala. Then the saga follows the line of Swedish kings until Ingjald (Ingjald illråde), after which the descendants settled in Norway and became the ancestors of the Norwegian King Harald Fairhair.
In the initial stanzas of the poem Asagarth is the capital of Asaland, a section of Asia to the east of the Tana-kvísl or Vana-Kvísl river (kvísl is "fork"), which Snorri explains is the Tanais, or Don River, flowing into the Black Sea. The river divides "Sweden the Great", a concession to the Viking point of view. It is never called that prior to the Vikings (Section 1).
The river lands are occupied by the Vanir and are called Vanaland or Vanaheim. It is unclear what people Snorri thinks the Vanes are, whether the proto-Slavic Venedi or the east Germanic Vandals, who had been in that region at that time for well over 1000 years. He does not say; however, the Germanic names of the characters, such as Njord, Frey and Vanlandi, indicate he had the Vandals in mind.

The Eurasian Wryneck (Jynx torquilla) is a species of wryneck in the woodpecker family. This species mainly breeds in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Most populations are migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and in southern Asia from Iran to the Indian Subcontinent, but some are resident in northwestern Africa. It is a bird of open countryside, woodland and orchards.
Eurasian Wrynecks measure about [tpl]convert|16.5|cm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and have bills shorter and less dagger-like than those of other woodpeckers. Their upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. Their underparts are cream speckled and spotted with brown. Their chief prey is ants and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or on the ground. The eggs are white as is the case with many birds that nest in holes and a clutch of seven to ten eggs is laid during May and June.
These birds get their English name from their ability to turn their heads through almost 180 degrees. When disturbed at the nest, they use this snake-like  head twisting and hissing as a threat display. This odd behaviour led to their use in witchcraft, hence to put a "jinx" on someone.

[[Century Dictionary]]

CATEGORIES: 1889 books, American English, English dictionaries

The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia was one of the largest encyclopedic dictionaries of the English language.  The first edition was published from 1889 to 1891 by The Century Company of New York, in six, eight, or ten volume versions (originally issued in 24 fascicles) in 7,046 pages with some 10,000 wood-engraved illustrations.  It was edited by Sanskrit scholar and linguist William Dwight Whitney, with Benjamin Eli Smith's assistance.  It was a great expansion of the smaller Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, which in turn had been based on the 1841 edition of Noah Webster's American Dictionary.  
[[Image:CenturyDictionaryVolumes.jpg|left|thumb|200px|
Meredith Publishing Company's 1963 edition of The New Century Dictionary.
Volume One: A—pocket veto and Volume Two: pock-mark—zymurgy & Supplements]]
After Whitney's death in 1894, supplementary volumes were published under Smith's supervision, including, The Century Cyclopedia of Names (1894) and The Century Atlas (1897).  A two-volume Supplement of new vocabulary, published in 1909, completed the dictionary.  A reformatted edition, The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, was published in 1911 in twelve quarto volumes: ten of vocabulary, plus the volume of names and the atlas.  This set went through several printings, the last in 1914.  The same year, the ten vocabulary volumes were published as one giant volume, about 8500 pages in a very thin paper. The now much coveted India paper edition also appeared around this time, usually in 5 double volumes (rarely, in 10 single volumes) plus one additional for the Cyclopedia.   
The completed dictionary contained over 500,000 entries, more than Webster's New International or Funk and Wagnalls New Standard, the largest other dictionaries of the period.  Each form of a word was treated separately, and liberal numbers of quotations and additional information were included to support the definitions.  In its etymologies, Greek words were not transliterated.
Although the dictionary was never again revised or expanded, an abridged edition with new words, The New Century Dictionary (edited by H.G. Emery and K.G. Brewster; revision editor, Catherine B. Avery,) was published by Appleton-Century-Crofts of New York in 1927, and reprinted in various forms for over thirty-five years.  The New Century became the basis for the American College Dictionary, the first Random House dictionary, in 1947.  The three volume New Century Cyclopedia of Names, an expansion of the 1894 volume, was published in 1954, edited by Clarence Barnhart. 
The Century Dictionary was admired for the quality of its entries, the craftsmanship in its design, typography, and binding, and its excellent illustrations.  It has been used as an information source for the makers of many later dictionaries, including editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, who cited it over 2,000 times in the first edition. In 1913, Stewart Archer Steger from the University of Virginia published his Ph.D. dissertation "American Dictionaries" and devoted a 14-page Chapter VI to Century Dictionary. He concluded the chapter with these words: "Altogether, The Century Dictionary far surpasses anything in American lexicography".

Tropicália, also known as Tropicalismo, is a Brazilian artistic movement that arose in the late 1960s. It encompassed art forms such as theatre, poetry, and music. The movement was characterized by a combination of the popular and the avant-garde, as well as a fusion of traditional Brazilian culture with foreign influences.
Today, Tropicália is chiefly associated with the musical faction of the movement, which merged Brazilian and African rhythms with rock and roll. Musicians who were part of the movement include Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Os Mutantes, Gal Costa, Tom Zé, and the poet/lyricist Torquato Neto, all of whom participated in the 1968 album Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis, which served as a musical manifesto.

[[Autodidacticism]]

CATEGORIES: Learning methods, Alternative education, Educational psychology

Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) or self-education is self-directed learning that is related to but different from informal learning. In a sense, autodidacticism is "learning on your own" or "by yourself", and an autodidact is a self-teacher. Autodidacticism is a contemplative, absorptive procession.  Some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas. Many notable contributions have been made by autodidacts.
Autodidactism is only one facet of learning, and is usually, but not necessarily, complemented by learning in formal and informal spaces: from classrooms to other social settings. Many autodidacts seek instruction and guidance from experts, friends, teachers, parents, siblings, and community. Inquiry into autodidacticism has implications for learning theory, educational research, educational philosophy and educational psychology.

Pampanga (PSGC: 035400000; ISO: PH-PAM; ) is a province of the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region. Its capital is the City of San Fernando. Pampanga is bordered by the provinces of Bataan and Zambales to the west, Tarlac and Nueva Ecija to the north, and Bulacan to the southeast. Pampanga also lies on the northern shore of Manila Bay. Angeles City, although geographically within Pampanga, is classified as a first-class, highly urbanized city and has a government independent of the province.
The name "La Pampanga" was given by the Spaniards who found the early natives living near the river banks. It also served as the capital of the archipelago for two years from 1762–1764 during the British invasion of Manila.  The word pampang, from which the province's name originates, means river bank. Its creation in 1571 makes it the first Spanish province on Luzon Island in the Philippines (Cebu, being the first settlement founded in 1565). The Province of Pampanga is the culinary capital of the Philippines.
Pampanga is served by the Clark International Airport, which is located at Clark Freeport Zone, some [tpl]convert|16|km[/tpl] north of the provincial capital.
The province is home to two Philippine Air Force air bases, Basa Air Base in Floridabalanca, and Clark Air Base in Angeles City.
The province is also honored as one of the 8 rays of the sun in the national flag because of its revolt against the domination of Spaniards.

[[GWR 4000 Class]]
CATEGORIES: Great Western Railway locomotives, 4-6-0 locomotives, Railway locomotives introduced in 1907

A Star class locomotive was a particular type of steam locomotive of the Great Western Railway. The prototype was an experimental locomotive, North Star (originally given number 40), constructed with the 'Atlantic' 4-4-2 wheel arrangement for comparative trials with 4-cylinder compound locomotives of the de Glehn type that had been purchased from France. This established the benefits of the balanced 4-cylinder layout but the designer, George Churchward, decided that he would continue the class with simple steam expansion, and also with the 4-6-0 wheel arrangement he had introduced with the 2900 class. As in the de Glehn design, the outer cylinders drove the centre driving axle, the inside pair of cylinders were set well forward and drove the leading driving axle. 
Construction of the production class began in 1907. In the production class (4001 to 4072) there were just two set of Walschaerts valve gear between the frames, the valves to the outside cylinders being driven by rocking levers.
An enlarged version of the design was introduced in 1923, as the Castle Class, of which about 170 were constructed, including some rebuilds from the 'Star' class.
One example of the 'Star" class, 4003 Lode Star, survives in preservation as a static, non-working, exhibit. On withdrawal from service, it was overhauled and repainted at Swindon Works, and as such is a rare example of a locomotive untouched since overhaul by preservationists. As a result of this, it is unlikely that it will ever be restored to operating condition.

In demonology, Beleth also spelled Bilet, Bileth, Byleth and Bilith is a mighty and terrible king of Hell, who has eighty-five legions of demons under his command. He rides a pale horse, and all kinds of music is heard before him, according to most authors on demonology and the most known grimoires.
According to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum Ham, Noah's son, was the first in invoking him after the flood, and wrote a book on Mathematics with his help.
When appearing he looks very fierce to frighten the conjurer or to see if he is courageous. The conjurer must be brave, and holding a hazel wand in his hand must draw a triangle by striking towards the South, East, and upwards, then commanding Beleth into it by means of some conjurations. 
If he does not obey, the conjurer must rehearse all threatens the conjurations said and then Beleth will obey and do all that he is commanded. But the conjurer must be respectful and do homage unto Beleth due to his rank, and hold a silver ring in the middle finger of the left hand against his face, as it is the use of hellish kings and princes before Amaymon.
Beleth gives all the love of men and women he is commanded until the conjurer is satisfied.

[[Walter J. Turner]]

Walter James Redfern Turner (13 October 1889http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36589?docPos=1 – 18 November 1946) was an Australian-born, English-domiciled writer and critic.McKenna, C. W. F., (1990). online: 'Turner, Walter James Redfern (1884–1946)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 12, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University: Melbourne University Press, accessed 28 October 2012.
Born in South Melbourne, the son of a church musician – organist at St Paul's Cathedral – and a warehouseman, Walter James Turner, and a woman of long golden hair, Alice May (née Watson), he was educated at Carlton State School, Scotch College and the Working Men's College. In 1907 he left for England to pursue a career in writing. There he met and befriended a number of literary intellectual figures, including Siegfried Sassoon, Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West, and Lady Ottoline Morrell (the caricature of her in his book The Aesthetes ended their friendship). On 5 April 1918, in Chelsea, he married Delphine Marguerite Dubuis (died 1951). During the period from the First World War until the mid-1930s, he was known primarily as a poet.  His 1916 'Romance' ("Chimborazu, Cotopaxi....") is probably the best remembered of his poems.
W. B. Yeats had the highest praise for Turner's poetry, saying that it left him "lost in admiration and astonishment",[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl] and included some of it in his Oxford Book of Modern Poetry (while omitting several authors very much better known today for their verse, such as Wilfred Owen). But today, although Turner produced several novels and plays, as well as books of poems, his reputation rests on his musical biographies of Mozart, Beethoven and Berlioz. He was musically untrained, and in the words of the music critic Charles Reid, "unhampered by any excess of technical knowledge" to restrain his "racy dogmatism."Reid, p. 189 His Mozart in has been reprinted many times in the 70 years since it was first published. Some of his musical articles for the New Statesman and other journals were reprinted in Music and Life, Facing the Music, Musical Meanderings, and Variations on the theme of Music. 
Turner was a close friend of the pianist Artur Schnabel, about whom he frequently wrote, and with whom he frequently went hiking.[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl] He was a champion of Arturo Toscanini's conducting, which was for him a revelation in structure and expression. Siegfried Sassoon was another close friend of Turner, at least for a while. Turner, his wife, and Sassoon all cohabited a house on Tufton Street before Sassoon moved out in 1925. After this he fell out with Turner so badly that he made no mention whatsoever of him in his autobiography.[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl] During the Second World War, he edited a number of volumes about English culture. On 18 November 1946 he died at Hammersmith of a cerebral thrombosis.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35767906 |title=Cable News in Brief. |newspaper=The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1931 - 1954) |agency=Australian Associated Press (AAP) |location=Adelaide, SA |date=21 November 1946 |accessdate=28 October 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia | quote = Literary Editor Dies The death has occurred of Mr. Walter James ("Redfern") Turner, literary editor of "The Spectator." at the age of 57.

John Campbell Shairp (30 July 1819 – 18 September 1885) was a  Scottish critic and man of letters.
He was born at Houstoun House, Linlithgowshire, the third son of Major Norman Shairp of Houstoun, and was educated at Edinburgh Academy and the University of Glasgow.
He gained a Shell exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford in 1840. In 1842 he won the Newdigate prize for a poem on Charles XII of Sweden, and took his degree in 1844. During these years the "Oxford Movement" was at its height. Shairp was stirred by Newman's sermons, and he had a great admiration for the poetry of John Keble, on whose character and work he wrote an enthusiastic essay; but he remained faithful to his Presbyterian upbringing. After leaving Oxford he took a mastership at Rugby School under Archibald Campbell Tait.
In 1857 he became assistant to the professor of humanity in the University of St Andrews, and in 1861 he was appointed to that chair. In 1864 he published Kilmahoe, a Highland Pastoral, and in 1868 he republished some articles under the name of Studies in Poetry and Philosophy. In 1868 he was presented to the principalship of the United College, St Andrews, and lectured from time to time on literary and ethical subjects. A course of the lectures was published in 1870 as Culture and Religion. In 1873 Principal Shairp helped to edit the life of his predecessor JD Forbes, and in 1874 he edited Dorothy Wordsworth's Recollections of a Tour in Scotland.
In 1877 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford in succession to Sir F. H. Doyle. Of his lectures from this chair the best were published in 1881 as Aspects of Poetry. In 1877 he had published The Poetic Interpretation of Nature, in which he enters fully into the "old quarrel," as Plato called it, between science and poetry, and traces with great clearness the ideas of nature in all the chief Hebrew, classical and English poets. In 1879 he contributed a life of Robert Burns to the "English Men of Letters" series.
He was re-elected to the chair of poetry in 1882, and discharged his duties there and at St Andrews till the end of 1884. He died at Ormsary, Argyllshire. In 1888 appeared Glen Desseray, and other Poems, edited by Francis Turner Palgrave.

Thomas Traherne MA ([tpl]IPAc-en|t|r|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|r|n[/tpl]; 1636 or 1637 – ca. 27 September 1674) was an English poet, clergyman, theologian, and religious writer.  Little information is known about his life. The intense, scholarly spirituality in his writings led to his being commemorated by the Anglican Church on 10 October (the anniversary of his death in 1674).
The work for which he is best known today is the Centuries of Meditations, a collection of short paragraphs in which he reflects on Christian life and ministry, philosophy, happiness, desire and childhood. This was first published in 1908 after having been rediscovered in manuscript ten years earlier. His poetry likewise was first published in 1903 and 1910 (The Poetical Works of Thomas Traherne, B.D. and Poems of Felicity). http://www.excitingholiness.org/first-edition/index.cgi?m10/d10b.html His prose works include Roman Forgeries (1673), Christian Ethics (1675), and A Serious and Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God (1699).  
Traherne's poetry is often associated with the metaphysical poets, even though his poetry was unknown for two centuries after his death. His manuscripts were kept among the private papers of the Skipps family of Ledbury, Herefordshire, until 1888. Then, in the winter of 1896–1897, two manuscript volumes containing his poems and meditations were discovered by chance for sale in a street bookstall. The poems were initially thought to be the work of Traherne's contemporary Henry Vaughan (1621–1695). Only through research was his identity uncovered and his work prepared for publication under his name.  As a result, much of his work was not published until the first decade of the 20th century.
Traherne's writings frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God.  His writing conveys an ardent, almost childlike love of God, and is compared to similar themes in the works of later poets William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. His love for the natural world is frequently expressed in his works by a treatment of nature that evokes Romanticism—two centuries before the Romantic movement.

Castle Hill was the site of a relatively large (390 by 102 feet) castle, built in the mid-13th century by the lord of the manor, Richard, Earl of Cornwall.  The castle fell into disrepair in the 15th century and its stone is said to have been used to build local houses. The Duchy of Cornwall still owns large amounts of land in the area.  Local industry and commerce includes the Hill Brush company, large wholesale plant nurseries and the notable Yapp's wine merchants.
St Michael the Archangel is unusual, in that it has 10 misericords; those on the south side of the choir, date from the 15th century, whilst those on the north side are early 20th century.
It is part of the historic West Country Carnival circuit.

The National Rugby League (NRL) is the top league of professional rugby league football clubs in Australasia. Run by the Australian Rugby League Commission, the NRL's main competition is known as the Telstra Premiership due to sponsorship from Telstra Corporation and is contested by sixteen teams, fifteen of which are based in Australia with one based in New Zealand. It is regarded as the world's elite rugby league championship and, per season, is the one of the most viewed and attended rugby football competition in the world.
The National Rugby League is the present-day embodiment of Australia's top-level domestic club competition, which in turn grew from Sydney's local club competition, which has been running continuously since 1908. The NRL formed in the aftermath of the 1990s' Super League war as a joint partnership between the sport's already-existing national governing body, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) and media giant News Corporation-controlled Super League,[tpl]cite web|last=Australian Rugby League and National Rugby League|title=Rugby league|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/whats_the_score/pdf/rugby_league.pdf|work=Australian Human Rights Commission Report|publisher=hreoc.gov.au|accessdate=13 May 2012[/tpl] after both organisations ran premierships parallel to each other in 1997.[tpl]cite book| last = Toby Miller, Geoffrey A.

James Riddle "Jimmy" Hoffa (born February 14, 1913 – disappeared July 30, 1975) was an American labor union leader who vanished in late July, 1975, aged 62. He is widely believed to have been murdered. 
Hoffa was a union activist from a young age, and was an important regional figure with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) union by his mid-twenties. By 1952, Hoffa had risen to national vice-president of the IBT, and served as the union's General President between 1958 and 1971. He secured the first national agreement for teamsters' rates in 1964, and played a major role in the growth and development of the union which eventually became the largest union (by membership) in the United States with over 1.5 million members at its peak, during his terms as its leader.
Hoffa became involved with organized crime from the early years of his Teamsters work, and this connection continued until his disappearance in 1975. He was convicted of jury tampering, attempted bribery, and fraud in 1964. He was imprisoned in 1967 and sentenced to 13 years, after exhausting the appeal process. In mid-1971 he resigned as president of the union, an action that was part of a pardon agreement with President Richard Nixon, to facilitate his release later that year. Nixon blocked Hoffa from union activities until 1980 (which would have been the end of his prison term, had he served the full sentence). Hoffa attempted to overturn this order and to regain support.
Hoffa was last seen in late July 1975, outside the Machus Red Fox, a suburban Detroit restaurant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-confirm-dig-search-jimmy-hoffa-body/story?id=8583134 |title=Jimmy Hoffa: FBI Won't Confirm Dig is Search for Body |publisher=ABC News |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2012-07-29[/tpl] His disappearance gave rise to many theories as to what happened to him.

Egon Krenz (born 19 March 1937) is a retired politician from East Germany (German Democratic Republic) and was that country's last Communist leader. He succeeded Erich Honecker as leader of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and head of state in October 1989, but resigned less than two months later amid the collapse of the communist state. 
Throughout his career, Krenz held a number of prominent positions in the communist government. He was Honecker's deputy from 1984 onward, until he succeeded Honecker in 1989 amid protests against the administration. Krenz was unsuccessful in his attempt to retain the communist state's grip on power, and was forced to resign some weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall. After the German reunification in 1990 he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for manslaughter, for his role in the crimes of the state.

The United States Chess Federation (frequently abbreviated as USCF) is a non-profit organization, the governing chess organization within the United States, and one of the federations of the FIDE. The USCF was founded in 1939 from the merger of two regional chess organizations, and grew gradually until 1972, when membership doubled due to interest in Bobby Fischer's rise to the World Championship. USCF membership dipped after Fischer's withdrawal from public competition to just below 50,000, and did not surpass its 1974 peak until 1992. Strong membership growth in the past decade has been spurred by the increase in scholastic chess clubs and the spread of chess computers.
The USCF publishes two magazines, Chess Life, which is advertised as the "most widely read chess magazine in the world", and Chess Life for Kids, which is a new publication for scholastic members, which represents just over half of USCF membership.
The USCF was incorporated in Illinois on December 27, 1939. It later became a 501(c)(4) after it established a headquarters in New York City.

The Methodist Episcopal Church, sometimes referred to as the M.E. Church, was a development of the first expression of Methodism in the United States.  It officially began at the Baltimore Christmas Conference in 1784, with Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke as the first bishops.Hyde, A. B. The Story of Methodism Throughout the World.

The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, or Methodist Episcopal Church South, was the Methodist denomination resulting from the split over the issue of slavery in the Methodist Episcopal Church which had been brewing over several years until it resulted in a schism at a conference held in Louisville, Kentucky in 1844.  This body maintained its own polity until it reunited with the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Protestant Church to form the The Methodist Church in 1939, which in turn merged in 1968, with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form the United Methodist Church.  Some more theologically conservative MECS congregations dissenting from the merger formed the Southern Methodist Church in 1940.

The Methodist Protestant Church (MPC) is a regional Church body which was officially formed in 1828 by former members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, remaining Wesleyan in doctrine and worship, but adopting congregational governance.
A majority of the Methodist Protestants were reunited with their fellow Methodists in 1939, and for that reason, the historic Methodist Protestant Church is regarded as one of the predecessors of the present-day United Methodist Church.
The Mississippi MPC delegation to the 1939 Uniting Conference withdrew from the proceedings, and the Conference was reorganized to continue as the Methodist Protestant Church in name, doctrine and practice.  As of 2008, the MPC consists of 42 churches in the United States, located in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma and a mission conference in the country of Belize.

[[Avant-garde jazz]]
CATEGORIES: Jazz genres

Avant-garde jazz (also known as avant-jazz) is a style of music and improvisation that combines avant-garde art music and composition with jazz.  Avant-jazz often sounds very similar to free jazz, but differs in that, despite its distinct departure from traditional harmony, it has a predetermined structure over which  improvisation may take place. This structure may be composed note for note in advance, partially or even completely.

The County of Edessa was one of the Crusader states in the 12th century, based around the town of Edessa.
In the late Byzantine period, Edessa became the centre of intellectual life within the Syriac Orthodox Church. As such it also became the centre for the translation of Ancient Greek philosophy into Syriac, which provided a stepping stone for the subsequent translations into Arabic. When the Crusades arrived, it was still important enough to tempt a side-expedition after the Siege of Antioch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/outremer.htm#edessa |title=Crusader States, Kings of Jerusalem & Cyprus, Templars, Hospitallers, Israel, etc |publisher=Friesian.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17[/tpl]
Baldwin of Boulogne, the first Count of Edessa, became King of Jerusalem, and subsequent Counts were his cousins. Unlike the other Crusader states, the County was landlocked. It was remote from the other states and was not on particularly good terms with its closest neighbor, the Principality of Antioch. Half of the county, including its capital, was located east of the Euphrates, far to the east, rendering it particularly vulnerable. The west part of the Euphrates was controlled from the stronghold of Turbessel. The eastern border of Edessa was the Tigris, but the County may not have extended quite that far.
The Siege of Edessa in 1144 was the first major setback for Outremer and provoked the Second Crusade. All the later Crusades, however, were troubled by strategic uncertainties and disagreements. The Second Crusade did not even try to recover Edessa, calculating it to be strategically better to take Damascus. But the campaign failed and Edessa was lost for the Christians. 
Today, the city is called Şanlıurfa and is part of modern-day Turkey; it retains nothing of its former importance. The Oriental Orthodox community largely disappeared after the Armenian Genocide during World War I.

[[Achromatopsia]]

CATEGORIES: Visual disturbances and blindness, Channelopathy, Rare diseases, Visual system, Visual perception, Agnosia

Achromatopsia (ACHM) is a medical syndrome that exhibits symptoms relating to at least five separate individual disorders. Although the term may refer to acquired disorders such as cerebral achromatopsia also known as color agnosia, it typically refers to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision disorder, the inability to perceive color and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels (typically exterior daylight). The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia.  The only estimate of its relative occurrence of 1:33,000 in the general population dates from the 1960s or earlier.
There is some discussion as to whether achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in The Island of the Colorblind by Oliver Sacks, some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color. One common trait is hemeralopia or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the cone system and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.

The Ardent Computer Corporation was a graphics minicomputer manufacturing company. The systems also used the Intel i860 as graphics co-processors. The company went through a series of mergers and re-organizations and changed names several times as their venture capital funders attempted to find a market niche for their "graphics supercomputers". After a series of machines that were not particularly successful in the marketplace, they used parts of their design to create graphics subsystems for other workstations, notably DEC machines, but eventually shut down completely in February 1995.

[[Mischief]]

CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Vandalism

Mischief, or malicious mischief is the specific name for different criminal offenses in a number of different  criminal jurisdictions. While the wrongful acts will often involve what is popularly described as vandalism there can be a legal differentiation between the two. The etymology of the word comes from Old French meschief, which means "misfortune,' from meschever, "to end badly."
In computer science and hacker jargon, mischief is a form of attack that clearly indicates the breach of the system and constitutes a form of injury or an infringement of rights, more specifically invasion of privacy, against which legal action can be taken to secure damages. Grey hat hackers often use mischief as a way to signal security breaches to system administrators.
Mischief is also a way for hackers to "prove" themselves to others. As an overt demonstration to other hackers of their skill in the use of force, these security breaches can be taken as a sign of criminal intent and may result in charges as serious as terrorism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/t/terroristic-threat/ |title=Terroristic Threat Law & Legal Definition |publisher=Definitions.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01[/tpl]  In this context, terroristic threat involves a threat to commit violence (the computer attack) communicated with intent to cause significant harm, inconvenience, or injury (the resulting breach) in reckless disregard of the risk of causing such harm, inconvenience, or injury.  Brute force is associated with hacker ‘mischief’.
Jurisdictions which have a specific offense of malicious mischief (with descriptions, if available) include the following.

Thomas Tallis (c. 1505 – 3 December 1585 by the Gregorian calendar then in use23 November 1585 by the Julian calendar) was an English composer who occupies a primary place in anthologies of English church music, and is considered one of England's greatest composers. He is honoured for his original voice in English musicianship.Farrell, J: Latin Language and Latin Culture: From Ancient to Modern Times, page 125. New York Cambridge University Press, 2001. No contemporary portrait of Tallis survives: that painted by Gerard Vandergucht (illustration), dates from 150 years after Tallis died, and there is no reason to suppose that it is a likeness. In a rare existing copy of his black letter signature, the composer spelled his last name "Tallys."Cole, Suzanne. Thomas Tallis and his Music in Victorian England, page 62.
