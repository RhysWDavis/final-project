He was well known as a defender of environmental influences on intelligence, and as an opponent of IQ, and he was regularly involved in the controversies surrounding that area of research (see, e.g., Howe, 1997b). As a widely cited example of this work, with colleagues Davidson & Sloboda he argued against the existence of innate talent,M. J. Howe, J. W. Davidson and J. A. Sloboda. (1998).

Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making is a controversial book about global governance by American author David Rothkopf, released in March 2008 by publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book claims that the world population of 6 billion people is subject to the immense influence of an elite (i.e. The Superclass) of six thousand individuals.
Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout — fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication — rules.  Further, the nation-state's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status.  Leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He proposes that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.

A seeding trial or marketing trial is a form of marketing, conducted in the name of research, designed to target product sampling towards selected consumers. In the marketing research field, seeding is the process of allocating marketing to specific customers, or groups of customers, in order to stimulate the internal dynamics of the market, and enhance the diffusion process. In medicine, seeding trials are clinical trials or research studies in which the primary objective is to introduce the concept of a particular medical intervention—such as a pharmaceutical drug or medical device—to physicians, rather than to test a scientific hypothesis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Krumholz SD, Egilman DS, Ross JS |title=Study of Neurontin: Titrate to Effect, Profile of Safety (STEPS) Trial: A Narrative Account of a Gabapentin Seeding Trial |journal=Arch.

By involving the opinion leaders as testers, effectively inviting them to be an extension of the marketing department, companies can create "a powerful sense of ownership among the clients, customers or consumers that count" by offering engaging the testers in a research dialogue. Seeding trials in medicine are not illegal but are considered unethical because they "deceive investigators, clinicians, and patients, subverting the scientific process".[tpl]cite journal |author=Alexander GC |title=Seeding Trials and the Subordination of Science: Comment on "Study of Neurontin: Titrate to Effect, Profile of Safety (STEPS) Trial" |journal=Arch.

[[2002–03 Arsenal F.C. season]]

CATEGORIES: English football clubs 2002–03 season, Arsenal F.C. seasons

The 2002–03 season was the 114th season of competitive football played by Arsenal. The club retained the FA Cup, a feat last achieved by Tottenham Hotspur in 1982, but finished runners-up to Manchester United in the Premier League. In the UEFA Champions League, defeat to Valencia in the second group stage meant Arsenal exited the competition at the same round for the second successive year.
Arsenal began the new campaign as league and cup double winners, and manager Arsène Wenger sought improvement in the Champions League, a competition the club failed in. The retirement of defender Tony Adams meant French midfielder Patrick Vieira was appointed as captain; Pascal Cygan was signed as a replacement in defence. Other recruitments included defensive midfielders Gilberto Silva and Kolo Touré, while goalkeepers Alex Manninger and Richard Wright departed to join Espanyol and Everton respectively.
In the league, a 4–1 win against Leeds United in September meant the club broke the record for scoring in consecutive games (47), and away league games without defeat (22). The club began 2003 in first position, but a draw to Aston Villa in April allowed Manchester United to move joint top. A further draw at Bolton Wanderers meant the league championship was, mathematically, out of Arsenal's hands and defeat to Leeds a week after ended their chances of retaining the league. Consolation came in retaining the FA Cup; a solitary goal scored by midfielder Robert Pirès was enough to beat Southampton in the 2003 final.
30 different players represented the club in five competitions and there were 17 different goalscorers. Arsenal's top goalscorer was Thierry Henry, who scored 32 goals in 55 appearances.

[[Balthazar Martinot]]
CATEGORIES: Clockmakers

Balthazar Martinot (1636–1714) was a French clockmaker, and valet de chambre of the queen and of the King.
His daughter Anne Martinot married the king's goldsmith Philippe Van Dievoet.
He was considered in his time to be one of the most famous clockmakers in Europe.
'He was born in Rouen, the son of Balthazar Martinot I (1610–1697), Gouverneur du Gros Horloge at Rouen. His brothers, Claude (1637-after 1697), Etienne (1639–1702) and Gilles (1658–1726) were also clockmakers of repute and in turn Martinot II sired Balthazar-Louis Martinot, who became Ecuyer, Valet de la Garde-Robe du Roi. Unlike his father, Balthazar Martinot worked in Paris from circa 1660, where he was established at rue Galande in 1683 and Quai des Orfèvres in 1697. He retired to Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1710, where he died a few years later. His talent aroused important patronage and gained great prestige. In 1665 he succeeded his father-in-law, Pierre Belon, as Valet de Chambre-Horloger Ordinaire de la Reine, Anne of Austria. He was later appointed Horloger Ordinaire du Conseil du Roi. Garde-Visiteur, 1678–79 and 1693-95. He was patronized by the most influential members of society including Louis XIV, the Grand Dauphin, the Ducs d’Aumont and de La Trémoille, the Prince de Rohan, the Marquis d’Argenson, the Comtesse de Polignac, the Cardinal de Gesvres, the Présidents du Harlay, de Lamoignon, de Maison and many others. He also sold several clocks to the King of Siam in 1685 and supplied a number to Constantinople. An inventory of 1700 revealed that he held the largest stock of clocks in Paris, while five years previously he had organized a significant lottery in association with his colleague, Nicholas Gribelin.
His clocks were not only of the very finest quality but were also housed in exceptionally beautiful cases; notably those made by Jean-Michel Ziegler and André-Charles Boulle. His works are now installed in some of the world’s finest collections including the Musée du Louvre, Musée de Cluny and Musée National des Techniques, Paris; the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Lyons; Musée de Saint-Pierre; Musée de Pau and Château de Champs; the Museum der Zeitmessung Beyer, Zurich; Musée d’Horlogerie de La Chaux-de-Fonds; the Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon, Dresden; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and the Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio.'http://www.antique-horology.org/gallery/asp/objectright.asp?id=276

Major Durga Malla was the first Gorkha soldier of Nepalese origin in Indian National Army (INA) to sacrifice his life for the cause of the nation.[tpl]cite news |title=Parliament honour for Netaji warrior |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1021122/asp/siliguri/story_1404192.asp |work=The Telegraph |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-14 [/tpl]
Major Malla was born in July 1913 at Doiwala near Dehradun from Nepali parents. He was the eldest son of Nb Sub Ganga Malla. In 1930, when Mahatma Gandhi was leading the countrymen for Independence through Dandi March, Malla was in class nine. Though he was young, he caught everybody’s attention by his outbursts in public against the Britishers. In 1931, when he was 18 years-old, he moved to Dharamsala and got enrolled in 2/1 Gorkha Rifles. His patriotism brought him close to INA.
In 1942, Malla joined INA. His devotion to duty and valour coupled with other skills elevated him to the rank of a Major in INA and was asked to work in the intelligence wing of the INA. When he was collecting information about the enemy camps, he was caught in action at Kohima on March 27, 1944. He was given death sentence by the Court of Trial at Red Fort, New Delhi. However, before the death sentence was finally executed, the authorities tried to coerce Major Durga Malla into confessing sedition. His wife was brought at the prison cell but Malla did not succumb to the pressure. “The sacrifice I am offering shall not go in vain. India will be free. I am confident. This is only a matter of time, Sharda! Don’t worry, crores of Hindustanis are with you”, said Malla to his wife. Those were his last words to his wife.
Malla was married to Sharda Malla of Shyam Nagar, Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh in 1941. Only three days after marriage, Malla was recalled at his headquarters and was directed to go abroad. He could meet his wife only before his hanging at Delhi District Jail. In 1944, Major Durga Malla was sent to the gallows.[tpl]cite book |title=Sikkim, Perspectives and Vision |last=Chamling |first=Pawan |year=2003 |publisher=Indus Publishing |isbn=978-81-7387-140-5 |pages=353 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D15liv9RDloC&pg=PA353&dq=%22Durga+Malla%22&num=100&sig=ACfU3U2O62RIVHUTvEQyjK92Fn8Vry4EgQ |accessdate=2008-10-14[/tpl]

Coffee production in India is dominated in the hill tracts of South Indian states, with the state of Karnataka accounting 53% followed by Kerala 28% and Tamil Nadu 11% of production of 8,200 tonnes. Indian coffee is said to be the finest coffee grown in the shade rather than direct sunlight anywhere in the world.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://ip.cals.cornell.edu/courses/iard602/2006spring/documents/sample_papers/value_coffee.ppt#1|title=Value Addition to Coffee in India|accessdate=2010-10-05|publisher=Cornell Education:Intag 602|first=Salomey |last=Yeboah|date=8 March 2005[/tpl] There are approximately 250,000 coffee growers in India; 98% of them are small growers. As of 2009, the production of coffee in India was only 4.5% of the total production in the world. Almost 80% of the country's coffee production is exported.[tpl]cite book|last1=Illy|first1=Andrea |last2=Viani|first2=Rinantonio |title=Espresso coffee: the science of quality|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AJdlfSFCmVIC&pg=PA47|year=2005|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0-12-370371-9|page=47[/tpl] Of that which is exported, 70% is bound for Germany, Russian federation, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, United States, Japan, Greece, Netherlands and France, and Italy accounts for 29% of the exports. Most of the export is shipped through the Suez Canal.
Coffee is grown in three regions of India with Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu forming the traditional coffee growing region of South India, followed by the new areas developed in the non-traditional areas of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa in the eastern coast of the country and with a third region comprising the states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh of Northeastern India, popularly known as “Seven Sister States of India".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.indiacoffee.org/indiacoffee.php?page=CoffeeRegionsIndia|title= Coffee Regions – India|accessdate=2010-10-06|publisher=Indian Coffee Organization[/tpl]
Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as “Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavour is defined as: "The best Indian coffee reaches the flavour characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst it is simply bland and uninspiring”.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:N96UHY1WRIgJ:www.coffeeresearch.org/coffee/india.htm+Coffee+Research+Institute+in+India&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in|title=Indian Coffee|accessdate=2010-10-06|publisher=Coffee Research Organization[/tpl] The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta.

[[Lacunarity]]
CATEGORIES: Geometry

[[File:Rotational Invariance Example.gif|thumb|right| Figure 1. Basic fractal patterns increasing in lacunarity from left to right.
Lacunarity, from the Latin lacuna meaning "gap" or "lake", is a specialized term in geometry referring to a measure of how patterns, especially fractals, fill space, where patterns having more or larger gaps generally have higher lacunarity. Beyond being an intuitive measure of gappiness, lacunarity can quantify additional features of patterns such as "rotational invariance" and more generally, heterogeneity.[tpl]cite pmid|8946315[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|9964879[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF00125351[/tpl] This is illustrated in Figure 1 showing three fractal patterns. When rotated 90°, the first two fairly homogeneous patterns do not appear to change, but the third more heterogeneous figure does change and has correspondingly higher lacunarity. The earliest reference to the term in geometry is usually attributed to Mandelbrot, who, in 1983 or perhaps as early as 1977, introduced it as, in essence, an adjunct to fractal analysis.[tpl]cite book|title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature| author=Mandelbrot| year=1983|isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5 [/tpl] Lacunarity analysis is now used to characterize patterns in a wide variety of fields and has application in multifractal analysis in particular (See Applications).

CATEGORIES: Fairies, Celtic mythology

In contemporary fantasy literature, a stray sod is a clump of grass enchanted by faeries. If a person steps on one, they will become disorientated and lost, even in familiar surroundings.[tpl]cite book|last=Franklin|first=Anna|title=The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Fairies|year=2004|publisher=Paper Tiger|location=London|isbn=978-1-84340-240-4|edition=Paperback |coauthors=Field, Helen|others=Mason, Paul (illus.)|page=237[/tpl] Wearing an item of clothing inside-out breaks the enchantment, allowing the person to find their way again. The concept and phrase appear to originate in ancient Celtic mythology, specifically Irish folklore.[tpl]cite book|first=E.

In other writing and in speech, the phrase "stepped on a stray sod" can be used metaphorically to denote sudden, unexpected or inexplicable disorientation.[tpl]cite book|last=Conway|first=D.J.|title=Advanced Celtic Shamanism|year=2000|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Freedom, California|isbn=978-1-58091-073-6|page=92[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Monaghan|first=Patricia|title=The Red-Haired Girl from the Bog: The Landscape of Celtic Myth and Spirit|year=2004|publisher=New World Library|location=Novato, California|isbn=978-1-57731-458-5|pages=54, 61[/tpl]

[[Tomatin distillery]]

CATEGORIES: Scottish malt whisky

Tomatin distillery is a single malt Scotch whisky distillery in the village of Tomatin. Its whisky is of the Highland region.  
Although it is thought that whisky has been distilled on the site since the 16th century, when cattle drivers would buy from a local still, the distillery was not established until 1897, under the name of Tomatin Spey Distillery Co Ltd. The company went bankrupt in 1906, and reopened under new ownership in 1909. After the liquidation of its owners in 1986, it was taken over by Japanese conglomerate Takara Shuzo and was renamed Tomatin Distillery Co Ltd.
The distillery operated with only two stills until 1958. Starting at that time, they began to add stills to increase production capacity, eventually reaching production of twelve million litres of whisky per year during the 1970s. Although in 1987 Tomatin was referred to as the largest malt distillery in Scotland,[tpl]cite book|title=The World Guide to Whisky |first=Michael |last=Jackson |authorlink=Michael Jackson (writer)|page=67 |url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=s4MEULDdJ9HEtAbQotzUBg&hl=en&id=-4QUAQAAIAAJ&dq=tomatin+whisky&q=%22Scotland%27s+largest+malt+distillery%22#search_anchor |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=1987 |isbn=9780863182372[/tpl] stills have been dismantled since the mid-1980s, bringing their total capacity to just over five million litres, though as of 2007, they were only producing 2.5 million litres. 
Around eighty percent of Tomatin's whisky goes into blended whisky, including its own brands of Antiquary and Talisman. The distillery, as of late, has been making an effort to bolster its name as a producer of single malts and is expanding its core range. In 2003, Tomatin's basic 10 year old malt was replaced by the 12 year old. In 2009, a 15 Year was added to the line-up, which also includes an 18 year old and a 25 year old. Other limited releases are often made, including a 30-year, a 40-year and single-cask offerings. Recently, the distillery has begun to produce a lightly peated single malt called Cu Bocan.

CATEGORIES: Iridaceae, Plant subfamilies

Crocoideae is one of the major subfamilies in the Iridaceae family.
It contains plants which are wildly distributed in the Old world, mainly in Africa, but there are species like some members of the genera Romulea and Gladiolus which are native to Europe and Asia. Some examples are Romulea bulbocodium, Romulea columnae, Gladiolus italicus.
Like the whole Iridaceae family, the members of the subfamily have the typical sword-shaped leaves. The rootstock is usually a corm. The blooms which sometimes have scent are collected in inflorescence and contain six tepals. The nectar is produced mostly in the base of the bloom from the glands of the ovary, which is where the flower forms a tube-like end. In some species there is no such end and the plant only provides pollen to pollinating insects.
The ovary is 3-locular. It contains many seeds with different vision in the different members. Sometimes the seed has a fine delicate coat like Gladiolus and in other cases it is black and with a hard coat as Babiana. It is often pellet-like, sometimes circular or semi-circular.
Many species of this group are among the best-known ornamental plants in the gardens or in pots. Some good examples are Freesia, Ixia, Crocosmia, Gladiolus and others popular flowers.

[tpl]unreferenced|date=August 2008[/tpl]thumb|Sylva Striker at Mondello Park
The Sylva Striker is the most enduring of the Sylva models and was a radical evolution of the Star and Leader, dropping the Viva donor car in favour of purpose-built suspension and lighter bodywork. The car was aimed at two markets, the home car builder that required an economical kit that could be built using readily available mechanics tools and the more demanding race car builder who favoured good handling and simple design.
The Striker has proved popular and successful on UK race tracks, most notably in the kit-car race series run by the 750 Motor Club.
The Striker was available in kit form, and could be built with a variety of engines, for example a Ford Crossflow, Ford Zetec, Toyota Twin-cam or even a motorcycle engine. These cars have high power-to-weight ratios and are best enjoyed in the summer due to minimal weather protection. In the UK all kit-cars are now put though the SVA (Single Vehicle Approval) to obtain a road vehicle licence. The Mk 4 version of this car, known as the Phoenix, was also manufactured in New Zealand from 1989.
The front suspension initially had outboard springs and shock absorbers, but with later versions, this was moved inboard with a rocker arm upper suspension arm. There were two types of rear suspension offered: one with a live axle, located by trailing arms, leading arms and a panhard rod. The other had independent rear suspension.
In 2002, Raw Engineering acquired the rights to the Striker and have made a number of modifications and variations since.

[[Kesatuan Gurita]]
CATEGORIES: Special forces of Indonesia, Indonesian Navy

Kesatuan Gurita (Octopus Squad) is an Indonesian Naval Special Forces unit based in Jakarta. Their primary role is off-shore counter-terrorism against shipping and oil installations. The units draws its troops from Indonesian Marine Corp soldiers.http://books.google.com.au/booksid=1Lfzhai05Q&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=Kesatuan+Gurita&source=web&ots=DEOzDqmkn2&sig=XtEYEUgXwBmVWJwZjieL6NY0Qb4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Power politics and the Indonesian military By Damien Kingsbury (Google Books)
Kesatuan Gurita is made up of eight regiments, each with 50 Marines.  The 400 specialists live in almost total isolation, secluded from family members and outside media during their four year tour with the unit.  The specialists are forbidden, under threat of forcible removal of finger and toe nails, from speaking of their work even after they finish their tour of duty.  The Indonesian Navy implants sensors in the neck of the soldiers, allowing monitoring of speech from the beginning of their tour to the time of the specialist's death.
The unit is made up entirely of men, after a change in policy in 1988, which excluded women from serving in Kesatuan Gurita.  Prior to the policy change women and men served side by side.  The change in policy, which was controversial at the time and continues to spark controversy in Indonesia from time to time, stemmed from a pregnancy that occurred in 1986 in one of the women serving in the unit.  While there was no formal policy forbidding frateranization between soldiers, leadership in the Indonesian Navy felt that the temptation was too great to have men and women serving together, bunking side by side, and in total seclusion.  The leadership also felt that the risk of fetal harm was too great and indicated in an official statement that "the value of a non-terrorist human life, especially one that has yet to sin, is too great to compromise in the world of explosives, bio-chemical terror agents, and elements that we may not even know yet."  There was a significant outcry from the 132 women who were in the unit and not pregnant, as they had to be reassigned to different areas within the military.  One female soldier, who appeared on television without releasing her identity, said, "We are trained couter-terrorism agents.  We take precautions everywhere we go, in every activity.  I wear three weapons when I go to the grocery store.  The fact that this (expletive deleted) couldn't take the simple and obvious precation to prevent pregnancy when she was just scratching an itch is disappointing.  That I have to give up a position I have trained my entire life for because two people were thinking with parts other than their brains is infuriating."

[[Copyright Term Extension Act]]
CATEGORIES: United States federal copyright legislation, 1998 in law, Copyright length, 105th United States Congress

The Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) of 1998 extended copyright terms in the United States. Since the Copyright Act of 1976, copyright would last for the life of the author plus 50 years, or 75 years for a work of corporate authorship. The Act extended these terms to life of the author plus 70 years and for works of corporate authorship to 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever endpoint is earlier.U.S. Copyright Office,  Circular 1: Copyright Basics, pp. 5–6  Copyright protection for works published prior to January 1, 1978, was increased by 20 years to a total of 95 years from their publication date.
This law, also known as the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, Sonny Bono Act, or (derisively) the Mickey Mouse Protection Act,Lawrence Lessig, Copyright's First Amendment, 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001) effectively "froze" the advancement date of the public domain in the United States for works covered by the older fixed term copyright rules. Under this Act, additional works made in 1923 or afterwards that were still protected by copyright in 1998 will not enter the public domain until 2019 or afterward (depending on the date of the product) unless the owner of the copyright releases them into the public domain prior to that. Unlike copyright extension legislation in the European Union, the Sonny Bono Act did not revive copyrights that had already expired. The Act did extend the terms of protection set for works that were already copyrighted, and is retroactive in that sense. However, works created before January 1, 1978, but not published or registered for copyright until recently, are addressed in a special section ([tpl]USC|17|303[/tpl]) and may remain protected until the end of 2047. The Act became [tpl]USPL|105|298[/tpl] on October 27, 1998.

[[Seven (Enuff Z'nuff album)]]

CATEGORIES: Enuff Z'nuff albums, 1997 albums

Seven is the 7th studio album by American rock band Enuff Z'Nuff, which was originally released in Japan as ‘Brothers’ under the band name "Chip & Donnie" in 1994. Seven  was initially intended to form one half of a double-album for the Japanese market, paired with the record that would eventually become the album Tweaked. The sessions were split into two separate discs, with the pop sounding ‘Brothers’ LP getting re-branded as an Enuff Z'nuff album in 1997 for its stateside release. As well as the re-titling and new artwork, Seven contains two bonus tracks not available on the original ‘Brothers’ disc.
On Seven the band adopted a more acoustic sound compared to Tweaked, which may be seen as its heavier counterpart. Several tracks on the album are also significant to the band’s history:
"Down Hill" is thought by lead singer Donnie Vie to possibly contain late guitarist Derek Frigo’s last studio recorded solo with the band. "You And I" was played by Donnie Vie at bassist Chip Z’nuff’s wedding reception. "It’s No Good," an acoustic concert staple, was later re-recorded by and featured on Donnie Vie’s solo album Extra Strength. Other notable tracks are the lead single "Wheels," which was covered in 1998 by Arista recording artists The Tuesdays Album profile of The TuesdaysAllmusic. Retrieved January 15, 2012 and the John Lennon cover "Jealous Guy." Liner notes for the album were written by Rolling Stone Magazine editor, David Wild. 
Causing some confusion, Seven was later re-released under its original Japanese title, "Brothers" in the U.S. (featuring with new artwork and the Enuff Z'Nuff name) in 2008. The "Enuff Z'Nuff: Brothers" re-issue is the same as the original "Chip & Donnie" Japanese release in '94, meaning the bonus tracks from "Seven" are no longer present.z'nuff|chart=all}} Brothers album profile Billboard.

[[Auteur theory]]

CATEGORIES: Film theory, Concepts in film theory

In film criticism, auteur theory holds that a director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the French word for "author"). In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.
In law, the film is treated as a work of art, and the auteur, as the creator of the film, is the original copyright holder. Under European Union law, the film director is considered the author or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory.Google Books
Auteur theory has influenced film criticism since 1954, when it was advocated by film director and critic François Truffaut. This method of film analysis was originally associated with the French New Wave and the film critics who wrote for the French film review periodical Cahiers du Cinéma. Auteur theory was developed a few years later in the United States through the writings of The Village Voice critic Andrew Sarris. Sarris used auteur theory as a way to further the analysis of what he defines as serious work through the study of respected directors and their films.

Analog Science Fiction and Fact is an American science fiction magazine. As of 2013, it is the longest running continuously published magazine of that genre. Initially published in 1930 in the United States as  Astounding Stories as a pulp magazine, it has undergone several name changes, primarily to Astounding Science-Fiction in 1938, and  Analog Science Fact & Fiction in 1960. In November 1992, its logo changed to use the term "Fiction and Fact" rather than "Fact & Fiction". 
It is in the library of the International Space Station. 
Spanning three incarnations since 1930, this is perhaps the most influential magazine in the history of the genre.  It remains a fixture of the genre today. 
As Astounding Science-Fiction, a new direction for both the magazine and the genre under editor John W. Campbell was established. His editorship influenced the careers of Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, and also introduced the Dianetics theories of L. Ron Hubbard in May 1950.St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture. Ed. Sara Pendergast and Tom Pendergast. Vol. 1.  Detroit: St. James Press,2000. p129.Word Count:164.
Analog frequently publishes new authors, including then-newcomers such as Orson Scott Card and Joe Haldeman in the 1970s, Harry Turtledove, Timothy Zahn, Greg Bear, and Joseph H. Delaney in the 1980s, and Paul Levinson, Michael A. Burstein, and Rajnar Vajra in the 1990s.
One of the major publications of what fans and historians call the Golden Age of Science Fiction and afterward, it has published much-reprinted work by such major SF authors as E.E.

Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD, sometimes called Berkeley Unix) is a Unix operating system derivative developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) of the University of California, Berkeley, from 1977 to 1995.  Today the term "BSD" is often used non-specifically to refer to any of the BSD descendants which together form a branch of the  family of Unix-like operating systems.  Operating systems derived from the original BSD code remain actively developed and widely used.
Historically, BSD has been considered a branch of UNIX—"BSD UNIX", because it shared the initial codebase and design with the original AT&T UNIX operating system. In the 1980s, BSD was widely adopted by vendors of workstation-class systems in the form of proprietary UNIX variants such as DEC ULTRIX and Sun Microsystems SunOS. This can be attributed to the ease with which it could be licensed, and the familiarity the founders of many technology companies of the time had with it.
Although these proprietary BSD derivatives were largely superseded by the UNIX System V Release 4 and OSF/1 systems in the 1990s (both of which incorporated BSD code and are the basis of other modern Unix systems), later BSD releases provided a basis for several open source development projects, e.g. FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD or DragonFly BSD, that are ongoing. These, in turn, have been incorporated in whole or in part in modern proprietary operating systems, e.g. the TCP/IP (IPv4 only) networking code in Microsoft Windows and a part of the foundation of Apple's OS X and iOS.

It was founded in 1922 as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) to advance the business interests of its members. In its formative years it took on the role of devising guidelines for film content which resulted in the creation of the Production Code, and currently administers the MPAA film rating system. 
More recently, the MPAA has advocated for the motion picture and television industry through lobbying to protect creative content from piracy and for the removal of trade barriers. The MPAA has long worked to curb copyright infringement, including recent attempts to limit the sharing of copyrighted works via peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.

Koyaanisqatsi ([tpl]IPAc-en|lang|pron|k|oʊ|j|ɑː|n|ɪ|s|ˈ|k|ɑː|t|s|iː[/tpl]), also known as Koyaanisqatsi:  Life Out of Balance, is a 1982 film directed by Godfrey Reggio with music composed by Philip Glass and cinematography by Ron Fricke.
The film consists primarily of slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States. The visual tone poem contains neither dialogue nor a vocalized narration: its tone is set by the juxtaposition of images and music. Reggio explained the lack of dialogue by stating "it's not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words. It's because, from my point of view, our language is in a state of vast humiliation. It no longer describes the world in which we live."[tpl]cite video |people=Carson, Greg (director) |date=2002 |title=Essence of Life |medium=DVD |publisher=MGM Home Entertainment [/tpl] In the Hopi language, the word Koyaanisqatsi means "unbalanced life".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/glass_reflections.php|title=Glass Reflections|accessdate=2009-03-02[/tpl] The film is the first in the Qatsi trilogy of films: it is followed by Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002).

Cape Verde is a small archipelagic nation that lacks resources and has experienced severe droughts. Agriculture is made difficult by lack of rain and is restricted to only four islands for most of the year. Most of the nation's GDP comes from the service industry. Cape Verde's economy has been steadily growing since the late 1990s, and it is now officially considered a country of average development, being only the second country to have achieved such transition, after Botswana in 1994. Cape Verde has significant cooperation with Portugal at every level of the economy, which has led it to link its currency (the Cape Verdean escudo) first to the Portuguese escudo and, in 1999, to the euro.

[[Barsoom]]

CATEGORIES: Barsoom, Edgar Rice Burroughs locations

Barsoom is a fictional representation of the planet Mars created by American pulp fiction author Edgar Rice Burroughs. The first Barsoom tale was serialized as Under the Moons of Mars in 1912, and published as a novel as A Princess of Mars in 1917. Ten sequels followed over the next three decades, further extending his vision of Barsoom and adding other characters. The first five novels are in the public domain in U.S., but are still under copyright laws in most of the rest of the world.
The world of Barsoom is a romantic vision of a dying Mars. Writers and science popularizers like Camille Flammarion, who was convinced that Mars was at a later stage of evolution than Earth and therefore much more dry,The Planet Mars - The University of Arizona Press took the ideas further and published books like Les Terres du Ciel (1884), which contained illustrations of a planet covered with canals.canals of Mars - The Worlds of David Darling Burroughs gives credits to him in his writings, and goes as far as to say that he based his vision of Mars on that of Flammarion.ERB Library Project - Urania by Camille Flammarion John Carter is transported to Mars in a way described by Flammarion in Urania (1889), where a man from earth is transported to Mars as an astral body where he wakes up to a lower gravity, two moons, strange plants and animals and several races of advanced humans. In The Plurality of Inhabited Worlds and Lumen, he further speculates about plant people and other creatures on far away planets, elements that would later appear in the Barsoom stories.
The Barsoom series, where John Carter in the late 1800s is mysteriously transported from Earth to a Mars suffering from dwindling resources, has been cited by many well known science fiction writers as having inspired and motivated them in their youth, as well as by key scientists involved in both space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life. Elements of the books have been adapted by many writers, in novels, short stories, comics, television and film.

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Ruzhintsi Municipality, which lies in the southeastern part of Vidin Province. Ruzhintsi is located 54 kilometres from the provincial capital Vidin and 43 kilometres from Montana.
The village may have been founded in the 14th century. There are several etymologies suggested, two from Proto-Indo-European *h₁reudʰ-ó- ("red"): from ruzha ("rose") or from the dialectal verb oruzhavam ("burn down"), and one involving the name of Fruzhin, son of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman and organizer of the anti-Ottoman Uprising of Konstantin and Fruzhin in the early 15th century. The village church was built in 1852 together with a monastical school.

Marvel Comics' 2013 reprints of Moore's original Miracleman stories credit him as The Original Writer.
Moore started out writing for British underground and alternative fanzines in the late 1970s before achieving success publishing comic strips in such magazines as 2000 AD and Warrior. He was subsequently picked up by the American DC Comics, and as "the first comics writer living in Britain to do prominent work in America",[tpl]rp|page=7[/tpl] he worked on major characters such as Batman (Batman: The Killing Joke) and Superman ("Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?"), substantially developed the character Swamp Thing, and penned original titles such as Watchmen. During that decade, Moore helped to bring about greater social respectability for the medium in the United States and United Kingdom.[tpl]rp|page=11[/tpl] He prefers the term "comic" to "graphic novel."[tpl]cite web|url= http://blather.net/articles/amoore/northampton.html|title= The Alan Moore Interview|last= Kavanagh|first= Barry|publisher= Blather.net|date= 17 October 2000|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140226072653/http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/northampton.html|archivedate= 26 February 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= 1 January 2013[/tpl] On the term "graphic novel": "It's a marketing term. I mean, it was one that I never had any sympathy with. The term "comic" does just as well for me. The term "graphic novel" was something that was thought up in the '80s by marketing people..." In the late 1980s and early 1990s he left the comic industry mainstream and went independent for a while, working on experimental work such as the epic From Hell, the pornographic Lost Girls, and the prose novel Voice of the Fire. He subsequently returned to the mainstream later in the 1990s, working for Image Comics, before developing America's Best Comics, an imprint through which he published works such as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the occult-based Promethea.
Moore is an occultist, ceremonial magician,[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2007/05/10/1815/#more-1815|title= Magic is Afoot: A Conversation with Alan Moore about the Arts and the Occult|last= Babcock|first= Jay|journal=Arthur Magazine|issue= 4|date= May 2003|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130603044139/http://arthurmag.com/2007/05/10/1815/|archivedate= 3 June 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 25 January 2011[/tpl] and anarchist, and has featured such themes in works including Promethea, From Hell, and V for Vendetta, as well as performing avant-garde spoken word occult "workings" with The Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels, some of which have been released on CD.
Despite his own personal objections, his books have provided the basis for a number of Hollywood films, including From Hell (2001), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), V for Vendetta (2005), and Watchmen (2009).

This List of University of Florida Honorary Degree Recipients includes those persons who have been recognized by the University of Florida for outstanding achievements in their fields that reflect the ideals and uphold the purposes of the university, and to whom the university faculty has voted to award honorary degrees in recognition of such attainments.  Often, but not always, the honorary degree recipients have been alumni of the university, or other persons who have had ties to either the university or the state of Florida.
The modern University of Florida was established in 1905, when the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act which consolidated four pre-existing state-sponsored institutions of higher learning into a single state university for men.  After operating on the former campus of the Florida Agricultural College in Lake City, Florida during the 1905–06 academic year, the university moved to its present campus in Gainesville, Florida when the first academic and dormitory buildings were completed in September 1906.  The university traces its historical roots to the 1853 founding of the East Florida Seminary in Ocala, Florida, the oldest of its four predecessor institutions.
The University of Florida awarded its first honorary degree in 1909 to Andrew Sledd, in recognition of his four years of service as the founding president of the modern University of Florida.  The first woman to whom the university awarded an honorary degree was prominent Florida author and novelist Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings in 1941.

[[Willemina Ogterop]]
CATEGORIES: 1881 births, Year of death missing, People from Maastricht, Dutch women artists, American women artists

Willemina Ogterop was a Dutch-American artist and stained glass window designer who was born in Maastricht, Holland in 1881. After migrating to California in 1918 with her husband and four children, she worked in the Cummings Art Glass Studio in San Francisco as their principal designer from 1928 to 1953, designing nearly 500 stained glass windows, and creating more than 200 works of art in other media.
There are more than 80 venues, primarily Christian churches, in six states of the US which contain her stained glass works; however, the great majority of her windows are in 40 cities and towns in California, in addition to a total of 9 churches in the states of Nevada, Washington, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Louisiana. She donated three works of art to India, two of which can be found on public display: the woodcarving "Satyagraha" in the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi and a stained glass plaque depicting a poem in Sanskrit by the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, which is in the Tagore Museum at Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan, Bolpur, West Bengal, India.  The "Nehru Window" - honoring India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru - and delivered to him in 1946 by his sister, Mrs. Pandit, has never been located.
In addition to her prodigious professional art work, she created hundreds of oil and water color paintings, ink, pencil and chalk drawings and woodcarvings - many of which remain today, treasured by her grand and great-grand children.

The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bomber. The B-52 was designed and built by Boeing, which has continued to provide support and upgrades. It has been operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) since the 1950s. The bomber is capable of carrying up to [tpl]convert|70000|lb|kg|abbr=out[/tpl] of weapons.""Fact Sheet: B-52 Superfortress." Minot Air Force Base, United States Air Force, October 2005. Retrieved: 12 January 2009.
Beginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design evolved from a straight-wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used in informal circumstances, and it has become common to refer to the aircraft as the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker)."BUF." Wordorigins.org.

The B-52 has been in active service with the USAF since 1955. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], 85 were in active service with nine in reserve. The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command (SAC) until it was inactivated in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the Air Combat Command (ACC); in 2010 all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the new Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). Superior performance at high subsonic speeds and relatively low operating costs have kept the B-52 in service despite the advent of later, more advanced aircraft, including the canceled Mach 3 B-70 Valkyrie, the variable-geometry B-1 Lancer, and the stealth B-2 Spirit. The B-52 completed fifty years of continuous service with its original operator in 2005; after being upgraded between 2013 and 2015, it is expected to serve into the 2040s.[tpl]#tag:ref|Other aircraft with similarly long service include the English Electric Canberra, Tupolev Tu-95, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, Lockheed P-3 Orion and Lockheed U-2."Возвращение летающего медведя (Return of the Flying Bear) in Russian."

Olav EngelbrektssonAlso spelled: Olaf, Olavus; Engelbertsen. ( c. 1480, Trondenes, Norway – 7 February 1538, Lierre, Duchy of Brabant, Habsburg Netherlands ) was the 28th Archbishop of Norway from 1523 to 1537, the Regent of Norway from 1533 to 1537, a member and later president of the Riksråd ( Royal Council of Norway ), and a member of the Norwegian nobility. He was the last Roman Catholic to be the Archbishop of Norway before he fled to exile in 1537.

Florida [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Florida.ogg|ˈ|f|l|ɒr|ɪ|d|ə[/tpl] is a state in the southeastern region of the United States, bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 4th most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state capital is Tallahassee, the largest city is Jacksonville, and the largest metropolitan area is the Miami metropolitan area.
Much of Florida is a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits of Florida. Its geography is notable for a coastline, omnipresent water and the threat of hurricanes. Florida has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, encompassing approximately [tpl]convert|1350|mi[/tpl], and is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. Some of its most iconic animals, such as the American alligator, crocodile, Florida panther and the manatee, can be found in the Everglades National Park.
Since the first European contact was made in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León – who named it La Florida ([tpl]IPA-es|la floˈɾiða|[/tpl] "Flowery Land") upon landing there during the Easter season, Pascua Florida"Historic Feature: Juan Ponce de Leon Landing –  Brevard County Parks and Recreation Department on Florida's Beautiful Space Coast"[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]. Brevard County Parks & Recreation. BrevardParks.com. Retrieved April 3, 2011. – Florida was a challenge for the European colonial powers before it gained statehood in the United States in 1845. It was a principal location of the Seminole Wars against the Indians, and racial segregation after the American Civil War. Today, it is distinguished by its large Hispanic community, and high population growth, as well as its increasing environmental concerns. Its economy relies mainly on tourism, agriculture, and transportation, which developed in the late 19th century. Florida is also known for its amusement parks, the production of oranges, and the Kennedy Space Center.
Florida culture is a reflection of influences and multiple inheritance; Native American, European American, Hispanic and African American heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine. Florida has attracted many writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes. It is internationally known for golf, tennis, auto racing, and water sports.

Ralph Zurmühle (or Zurmuhle), Swiss composer and pianist, discovered his natural talent for the piano at the early age of five. He fostered it over decades with jazz and classical music studies.
Ralph's 4 CDs, composed mostly for piano, have been met with international critical acclaim. His first CD Between was released in 2000, Communion followed in 2003 and Our Mother in 2007. His most recent CD eQuinox, released in 2011, is produced and distributed by Valley Entertainment, New York. 
Compositions from these CDs have been featured in films and multi-media projects, both in the U.S. and in Europe. For more than twenty years Ralph has been scoring music for film and performing solo piano concerts, mostly playing his own repertoire. 
"25 years after the glory days of the solo piano genre sparked by artists like Keith Jarrett and George Winston, the solo piano album remains an elusive undertaking: very easy to do - very hard to do well. Swiss pianist Ralph Zurmühle is one of those rare artists, who does it sublimely well, with great sensitivity to touch, melody, and ambience.

[[Abandonment (legal)]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of former rail lines, Criminal law, Legal terms

In law, abandonment  is the relinquishment or renunciation of an interest, claim, privilege, possession, or right, especially with the intent of never again resuming or reasserting it. Such intentional action may take the form of a discontinuance or a waiver. This broad meaning has a number of applications in different branches of law. In common law jurisdictions, both common law abandonment and statutory abandonment of property may be recognized.
Common law abandonment is "the relinquishment of a right property by the owner thereof without any regard to future possession by himself or any other person, and with the intention to [tpl]sic|foresake[/tpl] or desert the right...."1 Corpus Juris Secundum “Abandonment” § 2 (1985) (emphasis added) and citations omitted. or "the voluntary relinquishment of a thing by its owner with the intention of terminating his ownership, and without intention of vesting ownership in any other person; the giving up of a thing absolutely, without reference to any particular person or purpose...."Id. (emphasis added) and citations omitted. By contrast, an example of statutory abandonment (albeit in a common law jurisdiction) is the abandonment by a bankruptcy trustee under [tpl]usc|11|554[/tpl]. In Scots law, failure to assert a legal right in a way that implies abandonment of that property is called taciturnity.

[[Slashdot effect]]
CATEGORIES: Internet terminology, Slashdot, Denial-of-service attacks, Computer networking

The Slashdot effect, also known as slashdotting, occurs when a popular website links to a smaller site, causing a massive increase in traffic. This overloads the smaller site, causing it to slow down or even temporarily become unavailable. The name stems from the huge influx of web traffic that would result from the technology news site Slashdot linking to websites. However the name is somewhat dated as flash crowds from Slashdot were reported to be diminishing as of 2005 due to competition from similar sites. The effect has been associated with other websites or metablogs such as Fark, Digg, Drudge Report, Reddit, and Twitter, leading to terms such as being Farked or Drudged, being under the Reddit effect, or receiving a "hug of death" from the site in question.[tpl]cite web|last=Wilhelm|first=Alex|title=How Reddit turned one congressional candidate’s campaign upside down|url=http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/01/17/how-reddit-turned-one-congressional-candidates-campaign-upside-down/|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=24 October 2012|date=17 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Reddit effect|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/newseditors/2012/08/the-reddit-effect.html|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=24 October 2012|date=August 31, 2012[/tpl] Google Doodles, which link to search results on the doodle topic, also result in high increases of traffic from the search results page.Williams, David E. "Google's unknown artist has huge following." CNN. July 19, 2006. Retrieved on July 19, 2006. Typically, less robust sites are unable to cope with the huge increase in traffic and become unavailable – common causes are lack of sufficient data bandwidth, servers that fail to cope with the high number of requests, and traffic quotas. Sites that are maintained on shared hosting services often fail when confronted with the Slashdot effect.
A flash crowd is a more generic term without using any specific name that describes a network phenomenon where a network or host suddenly receives a lot of traffic. This is sometimes due to the appearance of a web site on a blog or news column.[tpl]cite web|title=Flash Crowd Mitigation via Adaptive Admission Control Based on Application-Level Observations|url=http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~zbo/teaching/CS522/Projects/FlashCrowds-SessionAdmissionControl-TIT05.pdf|publisher=University of Colorado Colorado Springs College of Engineering & Applied Science|accessdate=25 May 2012|author=Xuan Chen|coauthors=John Heidemann|date=July 2004[/tpl]

Minarchism (also known as minimal statism) is a political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that states ought to exist (as opposed to anarchy), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions.Gregory, Anthory.The Minarchist's Dilemma. Strike The Root. 10 May 2004.[tpl]cite news|last=Peikoff|first=Leonard|title=What Role Should Certain Specific Governments Play in Objectivist Government?|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2011/03/07/what-role-should-certain-specific-governments-play-in-objectivist-government/|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=peikoff.com|date=March 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Peikoff|first=Leonard|title=Interview with Yaron Brook on Economic Issues in Today’S World (Part 1)|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2011/10/03/interview-with-yaron-brook-on-economic-issues-in-todays-world-part-1/|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=peikoff.com|date=October 3, 2011[/tpl] Such states are generally called night-watchman states.
Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state's sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.

Lojban (pronounced [tpl]IPA-art|ˈloʒban|lang|jbo-lojban.ogg[/tpl]) is a constructed, syntactically unambiguous human language based on predicate logic, succeeding the project of Loglan. The name "Lojban" is a compound formed from loj and ban, which are short forms of logji (logic) and bangu (language), respectively.
Development of the language began in 1987 by The Logical Language Group (LLG), who intended to realize Loglan's purposes as well as further complement the language by making it more usable, and freely available (as indicated by its official full English name "Lojban: a realization of Loglan"). After a long initial period of debating and testing, the baseline was completed in 1997 with the publication of The Complete Lojban Language. In an interview in 2010 with the New York Times, Arika Okrent, the author of In the Land of Invented Languages, stated: "The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban – a language created to reflect the principles of logic."New York Times, the.

Hayredin was founded in 1574 by four families who settled on land presented to them by a high-ranking Ottoman official. It may have existed before the Ottoman conquest of the Second Bulgarian Empire, as it was mentioned among the places burnt down by the invaders; the old name of the village was Eredin. The local Bulgarian Orthodox church of Saint Paraskeva was built in 1858-1862, and the Prosveta community centre (chitalishte) was founded in 1909. The village has a mineral spring.

[[Bismuth]]

CATEGORIES: Bismuth, Chemical elements, Poor metals, Pnictogens, Trigonal minerals, Alchemical substances

Bismuth is a chemical element with symbol Bi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent other metal, chemically resembles arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but is often seen in air with a pink tinge owing to surface oxidation. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.
Bismuth metal has been known from ancient times, although until the 18th century it was often confused with lead and tin, which share some physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic bi ismid, meaning having the properties of antimonyBismuth. WebMineral. Retrieved on 17 December 2011. or German words weisse masse or wismuth ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century to New Latin bisemutum.
Bismuth has long been considered as the element with the highest atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered to be slightly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays with a half life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe.[tpl]cite news| url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2003/apr/23/bismuth-breaks-half-life-record-for-alpha-decay| title=Bismuth breaks half-life record for alpha decay| date=23 April 2003| publisher=Physicsworld| first=Belle| last= Dumé[/tpl]
Bismuth compounds account for about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably Pepto-Bismol. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently about a third of bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.

Saudi Arabia lies to the west and is connected to Bahrain by the King Fahd Causeway while Iran lies [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to the north across the Persian Gulf. The peninsula of Qatar is to the southeast across the Gulf of Bahrain. The population in 2010 stood at 1,234,571, including 666,172 non-nationals.
Bahrain is believed to be the site of the ancient land of the Dilmun civilizationhttp://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198303/oman-the.lost.land.htm and later came under the rule of successive Parthian and Sassanid Persian empires. The country was one of the earliest areas to convert to Islam in 628 AD. Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was occupied by the Portuguese in 1521, who in turn were expelled in 1602 by Shah Abbas I of the Safavid empire. In 1783, the Bani Utbah tribe captured Bahrain from the QajarsThe Consolidation of Iran's frontier on the Persian Gulf in the nineteenth century, Lawrence G.

In the late 1800s, following successive treaties with the British, Bahrain became a protectorate of the United Kingdom. Following the withdrawal of the British from the region in the late 1960s, Bahrain declared independence in 1971. Formerly a state, Bahrain was declared a "Kingdom" in 2002.

[[AmigaOS]]
CATEGORIES: AmigaOS, CBM software, Software written in assembly language

AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga personal computer. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.
AmigaOS is a single-user operating system based on a preemptive multitasking kernel, called Exec. It includes an abstraction of the Amiga's hardware, a disk operating system called AmigaDOS, a windowing system API called Intuition and a desktop file manager called Workbench.
The current holder of the Amiga intellectual properties is Amiga Inc. In 2001 they contracted AmigaOS 4 development to Hyperion Entertainment and in 2009 they granted Hyperion an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right to AmigaOS 3.1 in order to develop and market AmigaOS 4 and subsequent versions.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/22360/Hyperion_Amiga_Inc_Reach_Settlement_All_Legal_Issues_Resolved | title = Hyperion, Amiga, Inc.

[[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]
CATEGORIES: Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United States, Raytheon products, Military equipment 1950–1959

The AIM-9 Sidewinder is a short-range air-to-air missile developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s. Entering service in 1956, variants and upgrades remain in active service with many air forces after five decades. The United States Air Force purchased the Sidewinder after the missile was developed by the United States Navy at China Lake, California.[tpl]cite book|last1=Babcock|first1=Elizabeth|title=Sidewinder Invention and Early Years|publisher=The China Lake Museum Foundation|date=September 1999|year=1999|accessdate=2012-01-25|quote=The Air Force subsequently procured Sidewinder AIM-9B missiles for its hottest tactical and strategic aircraft, p. 21[/tpl]
The majority of Sidewinder variants utilize infrared homing for guidance; the AIM-9C variant used semi-active radar homing and served as the basis of the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radar missile. The Sidewinder is the most widely used missile in the West, with more than 110,000 missiles produced for the U.S. and 27 other nations, of which perhaps one percent have been used in combat. It has been built under license by some other nations including Sweden. The AIM-9 is one of the oldest, least expensive, and most successful air-to-air missiles, with an estimated 270 aircraft kills in its history of use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-9.html|title=Raytheon AIM-9 Sidewinder|publisher=www.designation-systems.net|accessdate=2 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100209021021/http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-9.html| archivedate= 9 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

The United States Navy hosted a 50th anniversary celebration of its existence in 2002. Boeing won a contract in March 2010 to support Sidewinder operations through 2055, guaranteeing that the weapons system will remain in operation until at least that date. Air Force Spokeswoman Stephanie Powell noted that due to its relative low cost, versatility, and reliability it is "very possible that the Sidewinder will remain in Air Force inventories through the late 21st century."

The intent was to create an Earth-focused guide that would allow members to share information about their geographic area and the local sites, activities and businesses, to help people decide where they want to go and what they may find when they get there. It has grown to contain subjects from restaurants and recipes, to quantum theory and history. Explicit advertising of businesses was forbidden when the site was run by the BBC, but customer reviews were permitted.[ref]

The Georgian government and the majority of the world's governments consider Abkhazia a part of Georgia's territory, though Georgia is not in control of it. Under Georgia's official designation it is an autonomous republic, called the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, whose government sits in exile in Tbilisi.
The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian–Abkhazian conflict. The wider region formed part of the Soviet Union until 1991. As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate towards the end of the 1980s, ethnic tensions grew between the Abkhaz and Georgians over Georgia's moves towards independence. This led to the 1992–1993 War in Abkhazia that resulted in a Georgian military defeat, de facto independence of Abkhazia and the mass exodus and ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population from Abkhazia. In spite of the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations, the status dispute has not been resolved, and despite the long-term presence of a United Nations monitoring force and a Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peacekeeping operation, the conflict has flared up on several occasions. In August 2008, the sides again fought during the South Ossetia War, which was followed by the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia, the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement and the termination of the UN and OSCE missions.[tpl]cite news|title=Russia recognises Georgia's breakaway republics -2|location=Moscow|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=26 August 2008|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080826/116291407.html|accessdate=2008-09-09[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav063009.shtml|title=Georgia: OSCE Terminates Its 17-Year Georgian Mission|publisher=Eurasianet|author=Jean-Christophe Peuch|date=June 29, 2009[/tpl] On 28 August 2008, the Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia a Russian-occupied territory.Resolution of the Parliament of Georgia declaring Abkhazia and South Ossetia occupied territories, 28 August 2008.Abkhazia, S.Ossetia Formally Declared Occupied Territory.

The Registry includes films ranging from Hollywood classics to orphan films. A film is not required to be feature-length, nor is it required to have been theatrically released. The Registry contains newsreels, silent films, experimental films, short subjects, films out of copyright protection, film serials, home films, documentaries, independent films, television films, and music videos. As of the 2013 listing, there are 625 films preserved in the Registry.[tpl]cite news|last=Kilday|first=Gregg|title='Thriller' lands in National Film Registry|work=The Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i4045046a22fd32ff3ffd9ecdd8adcfad|date=December 30, 2009|accessdate=December 30, 2009[/tpl]
The earliest listed film is Newark Athlete (1891), and the most recent is Decasia (2002). Counting the 11 multi-year serials in the Registry once each (as the Registry does) by year of completion, the year with the most films selected is 1939, with 18 films from that year chosen for preservation. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 119 years, when the 1891 Newark Athlete was selected in 2010. The shortest range is the minimum 10 years; this span is shared by Raging Bull, Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas, Toy Story, and Fargo. Films released prior to 1979 had no opportunity for such a minimum-time selection. In the first year of the registry, Star Wars was the youngest film selected with no other film from the 1970s to be picked.

The Plays of William Shakespeare was an 18th-century edition of the dramatic works of William Shakespeare, edited by Samuel Johnson and George Steevens. Johnson announced his intention to edit Shakespeare's plays in his Miscellaneous Observations on Macbeth (1745), and a full Proposal for the edition was published in 1756. The edition was finally published in 1765.
In the "Preface" to his edition, Johnson justifies trying to determine the original language of the Shakespearean plays. To benefit the reading audience, he added explanatory notes to various passages. Later editors followed Johnson's lead and sought to determine an authoritative text of Shakespeare.

Pinochet assumed power in Chile following a coup d'état on 11 September 1973 that overthrew the elected socialist Unidad Popular government of President Salvador Allende and ended civilian rule.

Under the influence of the free market-oriented neoliberal "Chicago Boys", the military government implemented economic reforms, including currency stabilization, tariff cutting, opening Chile's markets to global trade, restricting labor unions, privatizing social security, and the privatization of hundreds of state-controlled industries.

Pinochet's 17-year rule was given a legal framework through a  controversial 1980 plebiscite, which approved a new Constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission. In a 1988 plebiscite 56% voted against Pinochet's continuing as president, which led to democratic elections for the Presidency and Congress. After stepping down in 1990, Pinochet continued to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army until 10 March 1998, when he retired and became a senator-for-life in accordance with his 1980 Constitution. However, Pinochet was arrested under an international arrest warrant on a visit to London on 10 October 1998 in connection with numerous human rights allegations. Following a legal battle he was released on grounds of ill-health, and returned to Chile in March 2000. In 2004, Chilean Judge Juan Guzmán Tapia ruled that Pinochet was medically fit to stand trial and placed him under house arrest.

[[Scarcity]]

CATEGORIES: Economics terminology, Value theory, Scarcity

Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem of having seemingly unlimited human wants in a world of limited resources. It states that society has insufficient productive resources to fulfill all human wants and needs. A common misconception on scarcity is that an item has to be important for it to be scarce. However, this is not true, for something to be scarce, it has to be hard to obtain, hard to create, or both. Simply put, the production cost of something determines if it is scarce or not. For example, although air is more important to us than diamonds, it is cheaper simply because the production cost of air is zero. Diamonds on the other hand have a high production cost. They have to be found and processed, both which require a lot of money. Additionally, scarcity implies that not all of society's goals can be pursued at the same time; trade-offs are made of one good against others. In an influential 1932 essay, Lionel Robbins  defined economics as "the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses."[tpl]cite book |last=Robbins |first=Lionel |origyear=1932 |edition=2nd |year=1935 |title=An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |page=16 [/tpl]
In biology, scarcity can refer to the uncommonness or rarity of certain species.  Such species are often protected by local, national or international law in order to prevent extinction.

[[Principia Discordia]]

CATEGORIES: Discordian texts, Discordianism, 1965 books

The Principia Discordia is a Discordian religious text written by Greg Hill (Malaclypse the Younger) with Kerry Wendell Thornley (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). It was originally published under the title "Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost" in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. The title, literally meaning "Discordant Principles", is in keeping with the tendency of Latin to prefer hypotactic grammatical arrangements. In English, one would expect the title to be "Principles of Discord."
The Principia describes the Discordian Society and its Goddess Eris, as well as the basics of the POEE denomination of Discordianism. It features typewritten and handwritten text intermixed with clip art, stamps, and seals appropriated from other sources, possibly in violation of copyright laws.
While the Principia is full of literal contradictions and unusual humor, it contains several passages which propose that there is serious intent behind the work, for example a message scrawled on page 00075: "If you think the PRINCIPIA is just a ha-ha, then go read it again."
The Principia is quoted extensively in and shares many themes with the science fiction book The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. While Wilson was not directly involved in writing the Principia, both the letter signed "Mad Malik" and the stamps used were his.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Notable symbols in the book include the Apple of Discord, the pentagon, and the "Sacred Chao", which resembles the Taijitu of Taoism, but the two principles depicted are "Hodge" and "Podge" rather than yin and yang, and they are represented by the apple and the pentagon, and not by dots. Saints identified include Emperor Norton, Yossarian, Don Quixote, and Bokonon.  The Principia also introduces the mysterious word fnord, later popularized in The Illuminatus! Trilogy; the trilogy itself is mentioned in the afterword to the Loompanics edition, and in the various introductions to the fifth editions.

[[Transfer effect]]
CATEGORIES: Ornithology

The transfer effect is a term used in ornithology to describe the phenomenon observed among the bowerbirds, in which there is a continuum from physically more ornamented species which construct rudimentary bowers (mating display nests), to physically drabber species which construct remarkably elaborate and colorful bowers. 
The postulation is that there is an evolutionary "transfer" of ornamentation, as a sign of male mating health, from physical characteristics to behavioral ones — with the benefit of reducing the visibility of the male and thereby its vulnerability to predation.

CATEGORIES: Freedom of speech by country

Freedom of speech is the concept of the inherent human right to voice one's opinion publicly without fear of censorship or punishment. "Speech" is not limited to public speaking and is generally taken to include other forms of expression. The right is preserved in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is granted formal recognition by the laws of most nations. Nonetheless the degree to which the right is upheld in practice varies greatly from one nation to another. In many nations, particularly those with relatively authoritarian forms of government, overt government censorship is enforced. Censorship has also been claimed to occur in other forms (see propaganda model) and there are different approaches to issues such as hate speech, obscenity, and defamation laws even in countries seen as liberal democracies.

[[Mount Friesland]]
CATEGORIES: Tangra Mountains

Mount Friesland is a mountain in the Tangra Mountains of Livingston Island, in the South Shetland Islands. It is situated [tpl]convert|12.5|km[/tpl] northeast of Barnard Point, [tpl]convert|9.7|km[/tpl] east-southeast of St. Kliment Ohridski Base, [tpl]convert|3.6|km[/tpl] southeast of the summit of Pliska Ridge, [tpl]convert|6.1|km[/tpl] south by east of Mount Bowles, [tpl]convert|2.9|km[/tpl] south-southwest of Camp Academia, [tpl]convert|7|km[/tpl] west of Great Needle Peak, and [tpl]convert|6.85|km[/tpl] north by west of Samuel Point. The peak is heavily glaciated and crevassed.
The feature was known to American and British sealers as early as 1820–21, and has been variously known as "Peak of Frezeland", "Friezland Peak", and "Friesland Peak". In the early 1900s the name "Barnard", applied by James Weddell in 1825 to nearby Needle Peak, was transferred to this mountain. The original name has now been restored; the spelling "Friesland" appears to have been more frequently used than any of the other versions.  The name Barnard Point has since been approved for the nearby point at the southeast side of False Bay.
The first ascent of Mount Friesland was made from Juan Carlos I Base on 30 December 1991 by the Catalan climbers Francesc Sàbat and Jorge Enrique, after whom Sàbat Hill and Enrique Hill, respectively, were named. The peak was climbed and GPS surveyed by the Australians Damien Gildea and John Bath and the Chilean Rodrigo Fica on 20 December 2003; they produced a new map of the island in 2004, based on Spanish satellite imagery and their GPS data. The third ascent was made by the Bulgarians Lyubomir Ivanov and Doychin Vasilev from Camp Academia on 15 December 2004. All these used the eastern route to the peak, by way of Catalunyan Saddle and Presian Ridge.

[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]

CATEGORIES: English-language encyclopedias, Ethiopian culture

The Encyclopaedia Aethiopica (EAE) is the basic reference work for Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies. The Encyclopaedia Aethiopica provides access to reliable and state-of-the art information in all fields of the discipline, i.e. anthropology, archaeology, ethnology, history, geography, languages and literatures, art, religion, culture and basic data. Although the main audience is academic, most articles are readable also for non-specialists. The EAE is richly illustrated with maps and photographs many of which were never published before. It does, however, employ an in-house form of romanization of Geez, Amharic, and other languages, which varies greatly from standard formats, such as BGN/PCGN: the emperor Menelek II's name, for example, is written as "Mənilək II".
The Encyclopaedia Aethiopica has hundreds of authors from up to thirty countries. High academic standards are secured by an editorial team based at the Research Unit Ethiopian Studies (since 2009 Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian Studies) at the University of Hamburg in Germany, and experts on all important fields and a board of international supervisors supported the editors. Editor-in-chief is Prof. Dr. Dr. Siegbert Uhlig, former holder of the chair of Ethiopian Studies at the Asia-Africa Institute of Hamburg University and (since 2009) his successor Prof. Dr. Alessandro Bausi.
Planned to consist of five volumes when finished, the first four volumes (2003, 2005, 2007, 2010) are already in print. The first volume includes letters A-C, the second volume is dedicated to letters D-Ha, the third volume covers He-N, and the fourth volume has the articles starting with the letters O through X. The following volume will, besides the letters Y-Z, include a comprehensive index, supplementary articles, and additional maps and material.
The EAE is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the Zeit-Stiftung Ebelin und Gerd Bucerius, the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, the German Israeli Foundation, the Johanna und Fritz Buch Gedächtnis-Stiftung, the Karl H. Ditze Stiftung, the Sigrid Rausing Trust and the University of Hamburg.

Historically, library science has also included archival science.Harris, Michael H. History of Libraries in the Western World. 4th ed. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow, 1995. 3 - "The distinction between a library and an archive is relatively modern" This includes how information resources are organized to serve the needs of select user group, how people interact with classification systems and technology, how information is acquired, evaluated and applied by people in and outside of libraries as well as cross-culturally, how people are trained and educated for careers in libraries, the ethics that guide library service and organization, the legal status of libraries and information resources, and the applied science of computer technology used in documentation and records management.
There is no generally agreed-upon distinction between the terms library science, librarianship, and library and information science, and to a certain extent they are interchangeable, perhaps differing most significantly in connotation. The term library and information science (LIS) is most often used;[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] most librarians consider it as only a terminological variation, intended to emphasize the scientific and technical foundations of the subject and its relationship with information science. LIS should not be confused with information theory, the mathematical study of the concept of information. Library and information science can also be seen as an integration of the two fields library science and information science, which were separate at one point. Library philosophy has been contrasted with library science as the study of the aims and justifications of librarianship as opposed to the development and refinement of techniques.Cossette, Andre Humanism and Libraries: An Essay on the Philosophy of Librarianship.

[[File format]]

CATEGORIES: Computer file formats

A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open.
Some file formats are designed for very particular types of data: PNG files, for example, store bitmapped images using lossless data compression. Other file formats, however, are designed for storage of several different types of data: the Ogg format can act as a container for different types of multimedia, including any combination of audio and video, with or without text (such as subtitles), and metadata. A text file can contain any stream of characters, including possible control characters, and is encoded in one of various character encoding schemes. Some file formats, such as HTML, scalable vector graphics, and the source code of computer software are text files with defined syntaxes that allow them to be used for specific purposes.

[[Civilization Fund Act]]
CATEGORIES: 1819 in law, United States federal Native American legislation, Assimilation of indigenous peoples of North America

The Civilization Fund Act was an Act passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1819. The Act encouraged activities of benevolent societies in providing education for Native Americans and authorized an annuity to stimulate the "civilization process". Thomas L. McKenney lobbied the Congress in support of the legislation. The Civilization Fund Act led to the formation of numerous Native American boarding schools towards the end of the 19th century.
The benevolent societies were a combination of Christian missions and the federal government.
Federal funds were allocated to schools designed to educate Native Americans in the ways of the white man. The goal was to "civilize" Native Americans by getting rid of their traditions and customs and teaching them reading and writing in the missionary schools.Levy, Yolanda H. "Deculturalization and Schooling of Native Americans", Retrieved on September 9, 2009
The passage of the Act helped define a class structure within Native American society.  While traditional Native Americans opposed the schools, "progressive" ones accepted the schools. Their education and command of the English language propelled them to leadership positions within tribes and ultimately led to policy shifts and treaties that ceded land to the United States government.Jeynes, William. "American educational history: school, society, and the common good", Retrieved September 9, 2009
"That for the purpose of guarding against the further decline and final extinction of the Indian tribes, adjoining the frontier settlements of the United States, are for introducing among them the habits and arts of civilization" annual sum/annuity is ten thousand dollars "and an account of the expenditure of the money, and proceedings in execution of the foregoing provisions, shall be laid annually before Congress."Prucha, Francis Paul (2000). "Documents of United States Indian Policy", p.33. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data., United States of America. ISBN 0-8032-8762-3
The Bureau of Indian Affairs was created in 1824 by the federal government and placed into the War Department.  It was created in order to administer the annuity given to the schools.Digital History Online Textbook. "The Missionary Impulse", "Native American Voices", September 9, 2009.

[[Metadata]]
CATEGORIES: Data management, Knowledge representation, Library cataloging and classification, Metadata, Technical communication, Business intelligence

Metadata is "data about data". The term is ambiguous, as it is used for two fundamentally different concepts (types). Structural metadata is about the design and specification of data structures and is more properly called "data about the containers of data"; descriptive metadata, on the other hand, is about individual instances of application data, the data content.
Metadata are traditionally found in the card catalogs of libraries. As information has become increasingly digital, metadata are also used to describe digital data using metadata standards specific to a particular discipline. By describing the contents and context of data files, the quality of the original data/files is greatly increased. For example, a webpage may include metadata specifying what language it is written in, what tools were used to create it, and where to go for more on the subject, allowing browsers to automatically improve the experience of users.
The main purpose of metadata is to facilitate in the discovery of relevant information, more often classified as resource discovery. Metadata also helps organize electronic resources, provide digital identification, and helps support archiving and preservation of the resource. Metadata assists in resource discovery by "allowing resources to be found by relevant criteria, identifying resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources, and giving location information."

The Cross of Saint Euphrosyne was a revered relic of the Russian Orthodox Church and Belarus, which was made in 1161 by Lazar Bohsha for the order of Saint Euphrosyne of Polatsk and lost in June 1941 in Mahilyow.
Euphrosyne, mother superior of Polatsk Convent, ordered the cross to decorate the new Transfiguration church. The simple cypress cross was decorated with gold, gemstones and enamel, depicting Jesus Christ, John the Baptist, Theotokos, the Four Evangelists, archangels Gabriel and Michael, and three patron saints of Euphrosyne and her parents. The work cost 120 hryvnas. Inside, the cross contained pieces of the Holy Cross and other relics. 
In the 13th century, the cross was relocated to Smolensk; after a long travel across the country, it was returned to Polatsk in 1841. The cross was thoroughly photographed for the record in 1896. In 1928 the nationalized relic was taken to Minsk, then, in 1929, to Mahilyow, and was locked in a safe box of regional Communist Party headquarters.

The Plott Balsams are a mountain range in western North Carolina, in the southeastern United States.  They are part of the Blue Ridge Mountain Province of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  The Plott Balsams stretch from the city of Sylva in the Tuckasegee River valley to the southwest to Maggie Valley in the northeast.  The Great Smoky Mountains border the Plott Balsams to the north and the Great Balsam Mountains border the range to the south.  The range comprises parts of Jackson County and Haywood County.  
Waterrock Knob, which has an elevation of [tpl]convert|6292|ft|m[/tpl], is the highest summit in the Plott Balsam Range.  Four other summits in the range rise above 6,000 feet, namely [tpl]convert|6240|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] Mount Lyn Lowry, [tpl]convert|6240|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] Browning Knob, [tpl]convert|6088|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] Plott Balsam Mountain, and [tpl]convert|6032|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] Yellow Face.  Other notable summits include the Pinnacle, which overlooks the Sylva area to the south, [tpl]convert|5810|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] Blackrock Mountain (near Yellow Face), and [tpl]convert|5875|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] Campbell Lick, which overlooks Maggie Valley.    
The Blue Ridge Parkway traverses the slopes of the highest mountains in the Plott Balsam Range, connecting Soco Gap and Balsam Gap.  A short road connects the parkway to an overlook and a National Park Service visitor contact station and bookstore near the summit of Waterrock Knob.  The Nantahala National Forest protects much of the south side of the Plott Balsam Range.  The Qualla Boundary, which is the reservation for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, includes parts of the range's northwest section along Soco Creek.  The city of Sylva maintains a municipal park along Fisher Creek in the southeast section of the range.  A memorial dedicated to leukemia victim Lyn Lowry, who died in 1965, is situated atop Lowry's namesake mountain.  The memorial includes a [tpl]convert|60|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] cross that is lit up at night, making it visible for miles from the surrounding towns.  A stand of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest coats the range's upper elevations.    
The Plott Balsams are named for the Plott family, whose ancestor, Johannes Plott (c. 1733-1815), immigrated to North Carolina in the late 18th-century from Germany.  The Plott Hound, a breed of hunting dog, is also named for the Plotts.Marcus Simpson, Harold Pratt, Birds of the Blue Ridge Mountains (University of North Carolina, 1992), p. 182.

[[Optical format]]
CATEGORIES: Optics

Optical format is a hypothetical measurement approximately 50% larger than the true diagonal size of a solid state photo sensor .  The use of the optical format means that a lens used with a particular size sensor will have approximately the same angle of view as if it were to be used with an equivalent sized camera tube where the actual sensitive target is smaller than the overall size.
The optical format is approximately the diagonal length of the sensor multiplied by 3/2 http://www.dpreview.com/news/2002/10/7/sensorsizes (table of sensor sizes at bottom)  The result is expressed in inches  and is usually (but not always) rounded to a convenient fraction. For instance, a 6.4x4.8 mm sensor has a diagonal of 8.0 mm and therefore an optical format of 8.0*3/2 = 12 mm, which is expressed to the convenient imperial fraction of 1/2 inch. The reason why it is expressed in inches is historical: a standard four thirds inch image sensor has an image area with a diagonal measurement of approximately [tpl]convert|22|mm|inch[/tpl]. 
For larger systems the size is usually given as the true rectangular dimensions of the imaging sensor in millimeters, such as 36 x 24 mm in the case of 35 mm film sized sensors.
Many image device sheets don't list the actual optical format, but do list the size of their pixels in terms of micrometers, a more helpful equation is to convert the pixel size, and array size, directly to optical format. The equation for this is:

MO:DCA
(Mixed Object:Document Content Architecture) is an IBM compound document format for text and graphics elements in a document. The 'Mixed Object' refers to the fact that an MO:DCA file can contain multiple types of objects, including text, images, vector graphics, and barcodes.[tpl]efn|To generate a barcode an application provides a string of digits along with controls that identify a specific type of barcode, and the rendering of bars will be done on the output platform (physical printer hardware or software emulation).[/tpl] 
MO:DCA supports Revisable Documents, which are editable like revisable-form text, Presentation Documents, which provide specific output formatting similar to final-form text, and Resource Documents, which hold control information such as fonts. An MO:DCA file consists of a sequential, ordered hierarchy of independent objects - documents, pages, data objects, and resource objects such as fonts and ICC profiles. Each object is delimited by begin/end structures, and objects to be rendered specify presentation parameters and resource requirements in structures called "environment groups". Since the pages in MO:DCA documents appear in sequential order, presentation can start as soon as the first page is received.IBM MO:DCA
Formats for specific objects are specified in various OCAs (Object Content Architectures): PTOCA for presentation text that has been formatted for output, GOCA for vector graphics objects, IOCA for bitmapped Images, FOCA for fonts, and BCOCA for barcodes. MO:DCA is implemented as IBM's Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) page description language. MO:DCA Definition

[[Lactarius blennius]]
CATEGORIES: Fungi described in 1815, Lactarius, Fungi of Europe, Inedible fungi

Lactarius blennius (commonly known as the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a medium-sized mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European Beech (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It has been the subject of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L. blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.

Michael Anthony Banks, better known as "Mad" Mike Banks, is an American techno producer. He is the co-founder, along with Jeff Mills, of US record label Underground Resistance and was a key player in the "second generation" of Detroit techno.
Banks lives in Detroit, Michigan and is a former studio musician (bass/guitar), having played with Parliament/Funkadelic among others.Night Drive: A Bluffer's Guide to Detroit Techno. Stylus Magazine, March 7, 2006. He worked in the second half of the 1980s with the collective Members of the House, releasing several 12" singles. Banks and Mills founded the label Underground Resistance in the late 1980s, and the pair, along with Robert Hood, produced most of the label's early releases.Sean Cooper, Mad Mike Banks at Allmusic After Hood and Mills's departure from Underground Resistance, Banks headed the label himself, releasing material from acts such as Drexciya and Sean Deason in addition to his own productions.
He is also co-founder and co-owner with Christa Robinson of Submerge Distribution since 1992. Submerge, along with Underground Resistance, is an independent record label which distributes Detroit-based techno worldwide.Chris Handyside, Progressive Heroes: Mike Banks. Metro Times, November 10, 1999.
Among Banks's early influences are Derrick May, Juan Atkins and Marshall Jefferson; his later work shows his increasing interest in acid house and industrial. Banks has hewn strictly to an ethic of the underground and refuses to be photographed in public as part of this ethic. His releases often deal with elements of political and social commentary, which have made him a controversial figure from within the Detroit electronic music scene. Banks quit playing live shows in the late 1990s due to continuing problems with customs agencies, but began doing live shows again in the mid-2000s.Mike Banks interview. The Wire #285, November 2007.

Copyleft (a play on the word copyright) is the practice of using copyright law to offer the right to distribute copies and modified versions of a work and requiring that the same rights be preserved in modified versions of the work.  In other words, copyleft is a general method for marking a creative work as freely available to be modified, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the creative work to be free as well.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/copyleft |title=What is Copyleft? |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl]
Copyleft is a form of and can be used to maintain copyright conditions for works such as computer software, documents, and art. In general, copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of the work. In contrast, under copyleft, an author may give every person who receives a copy of a work permission to reproduce, adapt or distribute it and require that any resulting copies or adaptations are also bound by the same licensing agreement.
Copyleft licenses (for software) require that information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients of the executable. The source code files will usually contain a copy of the license terms and acknowledge the author(s).
Copyleft type licenses are a novel use of existing copyright law to ensure a work remains freely available. The GNU General Public License, originally written by Richard Stallman, was the first copyleft license to see extensive use, and continues to dominate the licensing of copylefted software. Creative Commons, a non-profit organization founded by Lawrence Lessig, provides a similar license provision condition called ShareAlike.

Oxford University Press. (1984) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties (called adversaries).[tpl]cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Rivest|editor=J. Van Leeuwen|title=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science|chapter=Cryptology|volume=1|publisher=Elsevier|year=1990[/tpl] More generally, it is about constructing and analyzing protocols that overcome the influence of adversaries[tpl]Cite book|first1=Mihir|last1=Bellare|first2=Phillip|last2=Rogaway|title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography|chapter=Introduction|page=10|date=21 September 2005[/tpl] and which are related to various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Modern cryptography intersects the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.
Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted persons to do the same. Since World War I and the advent of the computer, the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread.
Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that [tpl]not a typo|provably[/tpl] cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the one-time pad—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.
Cryptology-related technology has raised a number of legal issues. In the United Kingdom, additions to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 require a suspected criminal to hand over his or her decryption key if asked by law enforcement. Otherwise the user will face a criminal charge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/137881/uk_data_encryption_disclosure_law_takes_effect.html |title=UK Data Encryption Disclosure Law Takes Effect |publisher=Pcworld.com |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2012-01-28[/tpl] The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was involved in a case in the United States which questioned whether requiring suspected criminals to provide their decryption keys to law enforcement is unconstitutional. The EFF argued that this is a violation of the right of not being forced to incriminate oneself, as given in the fifth amendment.[tpl]cite web|last=Leyden |first=John |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/13/eff_piles_in_against_forced_decryption/ |title=US court test for rights not to hand over crypto keys |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2012-01-28[/tpl]

Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is a type of digital subscriber line (DSL) technology, a data communications technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. It does this by utilizing frequencies that are not used by a voice telephone call.ANSI T1.413-1998 "Network and Customer Installation Interfaces – Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) Metallic Interface." (American National Standards Institute 1998) A splitter, or DSL filter, allows a single telephone connection to be used for both ADSL service and voice calls at the same time. ADSL can generally only be distributed over short distances from the telephone exchange (the last mile), typically less than [tpl]Convert|4|km|0[/tpl],Data and Computer Communications, William Stallings, ISBN 0-13-243310-9, ISBN 978-0-13-243310-5 but has been known to exceed [tpl]Convert|8|km|0[/tpl] if the originally laid wire gauge allows for further distribution.
At the telephone exchange the line generally terminates at a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) where another frequency splitter separates the voice band signal for the conventional phone network. Data carried by the ADSL are typically routed over the telephone company's data network and eventually reach a conventional Internet Protocol network.

CATEGORIES: Telecommunications in Angola, Internet censorship by country 

Telecommunications in Angola include telephone, radio, television, and the Internet. The government controls all broadcast media with a nationwide reach.
In 2001, toward the end of Angolan Civil War, the government began adopting regulations to liberalize the telecom industry. This enabled private investments to revitalize the country’s telecommunications infrastructure which had been severely damaged by the decades-long conflict. By 2012, Angola had one of the largest mobile telecom markets in sub-Saharan Africa and Internet access was growing steadily. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MCT) oversees the telecommunications sector which is regulated by the Angolan National Institute of Telecommunication (INACOM)."Angola", Freedom on the Net 2013, Freedom House, 2013.

[[Ambient calculus]]

CATEGORIES: Process calculi

In computer science, the ambient calculus is a process calculus devised by Luca Cardelli and Andrew D. Gordon in 1998, and used to describe and theorise about concurrent systems that include mobility. Here mobility means both computation carried out on mobile devices (i.e. networks that have a dynamic topology), and mobile computation (i.e. executable code that is able to move around the network). The ambient calculus provides a unified framework for modeling both kinds of mobility.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cardelli|first=L.|author2=A.D.

The Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 is a United Nations treaty designed to control psychoactive drugs such as amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and psychedelics signed in Vienna, Austria on 21 February 1971. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 could not ban the many newly discovered psychotropics, since its scope was limited to drugs with cannabis, coca, and opium-like effects.
During the 1960s such drugs became widely available, and government authorities opposed this for numerous reasons, arguing that along with negative health effects, drug use led to lowered moral standards. The Convention, which contains import and export restrictions and other rules aimed at limiting drug use to scientific and medical purposes, came into force on 16 August 1976. As of 2013, 183 states are Parties to the treaty. Many laws have been passed to implement the Convention, including the U.S. Psychotropic Substances Act, the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Adolf Lande, under the direction of the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, prepared the Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Commentary, published in 1976, is an invaluable aid to interpreting the treaty and constitutes a key part of its legislative history.
Provisions to end the international trafficking of drugs covered by this Convention are contained in the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. This treaty, signed in 1988, regulates precursor chemicals to drugs controlled by the Single Convention and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It also strengthens provisions against money laundering and other drug-related crimes.

[[Bugtraq]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic mailing lists

Bugtraq is an electronic mailing list dedicated to issues about computer security. On-topic issues are new discussions about vulnerabilities, vendor security-related announcements, methods of exploitation, and how to fix them.  It is a high-volume mailing list, and almost all new vulnerabilities are discussed there.
Bugtraq was created on November 5, 1993 by Scott Chasin in response to the perceived failings of the existing Internet security infrastructure of the time, particularly CERT. Bugtraq's policy was to publish vulnerabilities, regardless of vendor response, as part of the full disclosure movement of vulnerability disclosure.
Elias Levy, also known as Aleph One (alluding to the cardinal number aleph one), noted in an interview that "the environment at that time was such that vendors weren't making any patches. So the focus was on how to fix software that companies weren't fixing."
The mailing list was unmoderated originally, but the signal-to-noise ratio eventually became unacceptably bad. Moderation began on June 5, 1995. Elias Levy moderated the list from June 14, 1996 until he stepped down on October 15, 2001.  David Mirza Ahmad, one of the many co-authors of Hack Proofing Your Network, Second Edition, took over from Levy and continued until he stepped down on February 23, 2006.SecurityFocus David McKinney, a DeepSight threat analyst at Symantec, took over from Ahmad and is the current moderator.SecurityFocus
Bugtraq was originally hosted at Crimelab.com. It was moved to the Brown University NetSpace Project — which has since been reorganized as the NetSpace Foundation — on June 5, 1995, the same day that its moderation began. In July 1999 it became the property of SecurityFocus and was moved there. SecurityFocus was acquired in full by Symantec on August 6, 2002.Symantec Acquisition of SecurityFocus Completed

Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic volcanic island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at [tpl]coord|54|25.8|S|3|22.8|E|type:isle_region:BV|display=inline,title[/tpl]. It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately [tpl]convert|2200|km[/tpl] south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately [tpl]convert|1700|km[/tpl] north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.
The island has an area of [tpl]convert|49|km2|sp=eu[/tpl], of which 93 percent is covered by a glacier. The centre of the island is an ice-filled crater of an inactive volcano. Some skerries and one smaller island, Larsøya, lie along the coast. Nyrøysa, created by a rock slide in the late 1950s, is the only easy place to land and is the location of a weather station.
The island was first spotted on January 1, 1739, by (and was later named for) Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier. He recorded inaccurate coordinates and the island was not sighted again until 1808, when the British whaler captain James Lindsay named it Lindsay Island.http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=James+Lindsay+Bouvet&source=bl&ots=hcE3ANBtqd&sig=TQN5iHGaChzt-Nul5bB8zPpF3F0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gkneUJ7-EqSx0QXx-IHgCg&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg The first claim of landing, although disputed, was by Benjamin Morrell. In 1825, the island was claimed for the British Crown by George Norris, who named it Liverpool Island. He also reported Thompson Island as nearby, although this was later shown to be a phantom island. The first Norvegia expedition landed on the island in 1927 and claimed it for Norway. After a dispute with the United Kingdom, it was declared a Norwegian dependency in 1930. It became a nature reserve in 1971.

[[Economy of Ivory Coast]]
CATEGORIES: World Trade Organization member economies, Economy of Ivory Coast, African Union member economies

The economy of Ivory Coast is stable and currently growing, in the aftermath of political instability in recent decades. The Ivory Coast is largely market-based and depends heavily on the agricultural sector. Almost 70% of the Ivorian people are engaged in some form of agricultural activity.  GDP per capita grew 82% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth of 360% in the 1970s. But this proved unsustainable and it shrank by 28% in the 1980s and a further 22% in the 1990s. This coupled with high population growth resulted in a steady fall in living standards. Gross national product per capita, now rising again, was about US$ $727 in 1996. (It was substantially higher two decades ago.) After several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994, due to the devaluation of the CFA franc and improved prices for cocoa and coffee, growth in non-traditional primary exports such as pineapples and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous external financing and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and France. The 50% devaluation of franc zone currencies on 12 January 1994 caused a one-time jump in the inflation rate to 26% in 1994, but the rate fell sharply in 1996-1999. Moreover, government adherence to donor-mandated reforms led to a jump in growth to 5% annually in 1996-99.  A majority of the population remains dependent on smallholder cash crop production. Principal exports are cocoa, coffee, and tropical woods. Principal U.S. exports to Ivory Coast are rice and wheat, plastic materials and resins, Kraft paper, agricultural chemicals, telecommunications, and oil and gas equipment. Principal U.S. imports are cocoa and cocoa products, petroleum, rubber, and coffee.

CDDB, short for Compact Disc Database, is  a database for software applications to look up audio CD (compact disc) information over the Internet. This is performed by a client which calculates a (nearly) unique disc ID and then queries the database. As a result, the client is able to display the artist name, CD title, track list and some additional information. CDDB is a licensed trademark of Gracenote, Inc.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Business 2.0|title=The Magic Behind the Music|date=2004-03-01|last=Copeland|first=Michael|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2004/03/01/363577/index.htm|accessdate=2009-05-23[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|journal=Wired|title=The House That Music Fans Built|date=2004-07-07|last=Dean|first=Katie|url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2004/07/64033?currentPage=all|accessdate=2009-05-23[/tpl]
The database is used primarily by media players and CD ripper software. If a CD is not recognized by a media player or CD ripper it can be added to the database if the user fills in the names and artists etc. in a media player such as iTunes or MusicMatch Jukebox.
The need for CDDB is a direct consequence of the original design of the CD, which was conceived as an evolution of the gramophone record, and did not consider the audio tracks as data files to be identified and indexed. The audio CD format does not include the disc name or track names, so a supplemental database is needed to supply this information when discs are used with modern media systems. A later development called CD-Text is another solution to the same problem.

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to communication:
Communication is a phenomenon that we all think we can recognise. There is, however, no universal agreement on a definition.Fiske, John. (1990) Introduction to Communication Studies (second edition). London: Routledge. The definition of communication varies across academic disciplines and between different theories, schools, and approaches.
Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law (Universal law of Communication) states that, “All living entities, beings and creatures communicate.”.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2GWd2j3qJ8 In an interview, Scudder clarified the concept – “All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, colour transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence. Examples – the cry of a child ; the release of Ethylene that makes apples ripen at the same time (communication that enables an apple tree's apples to collectively); plants reacting and sending chemical messages to communicate that caterpillars are present;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2GWd2j3qJ8 the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.). Everything living communicates.[tpl]cite journal|last=Craig|first=Robert|title=Communication theory as a field|journal=Communication Theory|date=May 1999|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–161[/tpl]
Scudder’s thesis is aptly reinforced by General Systems Theory, which submits that one of the three critical functions of living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems . In his book, Flor (2004, page 4) extends this argument by forwarding that, “All living systems, from the simplest to the most complex, are equipped to perform these critical functions. They are called critical because they are necessary for the survival of the living system. Communication is nothing more than the exchange of information. Hence, at its broadest sense, environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system, be it an organism, an ecosystem, or (even) a social system.”[tpl]cite journal|title=Communication Definitions |journal=Environmental Communication |date=June 2013 |url=http://%20http://topdefinitions.com/2013/06/20/environmental-communication-is/ [/tpl]

A video game console emulator is a program that allows a personal computer or video game console (cross-console emulation) to emulate a different video game console's behavior. Emulators are most often used to play older video games on personal computers and video game consoles, but they are also used to play games translated into other languages or to modify (or hack) existing games. Emulators are also a useful tool in the development process of homebrewed demos and new games for older systems.
Code and data of a game are typically supplied to the emulator by means of a ROM file (a copy of the data contained on a game cartridge) or a disc image (for systems that use optical media). Most game titles are copyrighted—although there exist various sources for such files on the internet, their distribution is prohibited under many legislations[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]. Specialized adapters such as the Retrode allow emulators to directly access the data on game cartridges without the need to copy it into a ROM image first.

CATEGORIES: Mountain artillery, 70 mm artillery, World War I artillery of Austria-Hungary

The 7 cm Gebirgsgeschütz M 99 was a mountain gun used by Austria-Hungary during World War I. It was obsolete upon introduction as it had a bronze barrel, a spring-loaded spade to absorb the recoil forces and it had to be relaid after every shot. The high elevations required of mountain guns greatly complicated the provision of barrel recoil systems as the breech could recoil into the ground, and it would be some years before satisfactory systems were worked out. These would result in the 7 cm Gebirgsgeschütz M 8 and M 9 that used the same barrel and ammunition as the M 99, but had gun shields and more advanced recoil systems. These guns weighed [tpl]convert|402|kg|lb[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|456|kg|lb[/tpl] respectively, although the exact differences between them are unclear other than they broke down into four and five loads for transport respectively.

The functions of the MINTERM are similar to those of the TACTERM; its updated design includes an improved modular architecture, and it has been reduced in size. The MINTERM is lightweight, low-power, single channel, half-duplex, narrowband/wideband/wireline terminal providing secure voice and data communications with full key distribution and remote rekey capabilities. The MINTERM is certified to secure traffic up to TOP SECRET.
The MINTERM improvements include the following:
The AIRTERM is a lightweight, self-contained secure voice and data terminal that provides secure half-duplex voice, digital data, analog data, and remote-keying capabilities for transmission over radio circuits or wireline media. It is a wideband/narrowband terminal that interoperates with the TACTERM, MINTERM, VINSON, and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).  AIRTERM accepts classified analog voice information and uses LPC-10 at 2.4 kbit/s in narrowband voice modes and continuously variable slope delta (CVSD) modulation at 12 kbit/s and 16 kbit/s in wideband voice modes. The AIRTERM provides the same connectors, with similar functional pinouts, as the VINSON for the wideband operational modes. http://www.fas.org/irp/program/security/_work/andvt.html

The ideas put forward within the manifesto aim to examine the impact of the Internet on both markets (consumers) and organizations. In addition, as both consumers and organizations are able to utilize the Internet and Intranets to establish a previously unavailable level of communication both within and between these two groups, the manifesto suggests that changes will be required from organizations as they respond to the new marketplace environment.  
The manifesto was written in 1999 by Rick Levine, Christopher Locke, Doc Searls, and David Weinberger. A printed publication which elaborated on the manifesto was published in 2000 by Perseus Books (ISBN 0-7382-0431-5) under the same name. 
The authors assert that the Internet is unlike the ordinary media used in mass marketing as it enables people to have "human to human" conversations, which have the potential to transform traditional business practices radically.
The book and website both challenge what the manifesto calls outmoded, 20th-century thinking about business in light of the emergence of the Web, clearly listing "95 theses", as a reference to Martin Luther's manifesto which heralded the start of the Protestant Reformation.
The term "cluetrain" stems from this quote:

CATEGORIES: Blaxploitation films, Cinema of the United States, Exploitation films, Film genres

Blaxploitation or blacksploitation is a film genre that emerged in the United States in the 1970s. It is considered an ethnic subgenre of the general category of exploitation films. Blaxploitation films were originally made specifically for an urban black audience, although the genre's audience appeal soon broadened across racial and ethnic lines. The term itself is a portmanteau of the words "black" and "exploitation," following upon the briefly-common use "sexploitation" for porn-inflected films, and was coined in the early 1970s by the Los Angeles National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) head, and ex-film publicist Junius Griffin. Blaxploitation films were the first to regularly feature soundtracks of funk and soul music as well as primarily black casts.[tpl]cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040611/REVIEWS/406110302 |title=Review of Baadasssss! |accessdate=2007-01-04 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2004-06-11 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Variety credited Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, released in 1971, with the invention of the blaxploitation genre while others argue that the Hollywood-financed film Shaft, also released in 1971, is closer to being a blaxploitation piece and thus is more likely to have begun the trend.[tpl]cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-312-13192-5 [/tpl]

In financial accounting, an asset is an economic resource. Anything tangible or intangible that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value and that is held to have positive economic value is considered an asset.

[[Digital library]]

An electronic library (also referred to as digital library or digital repository) is a focused collection of digital objects that can include text, visual material, audio material, video material, stored as  electronic media formats (as opposed to print, micro form, or other media), along with means for organizing, storing, and retrieving the files and media contained in the library collection. Digital libraries can vary immensely in size and scope, and can be maintained by individuals, organizations, or affiliated with established physical library buildings or institutions, or with academic institutions.Witten, Ian H., Bainbridge, David Nichols.Accessed January 31,2014. The electronic content may be stored locally, or accessed remotely via computer networks. An electronic library is a type of information retrieval system.
The term digital libraries was first popularized by the NSF/DARPA/NASA Digital Libraries Initiative in 1994.Edward A. Fox. The Digital Libraries Initiative - Update and Discussion, Bulletin of the America Society of Information Science, Vol. 26, No 1, October/November 1999. These draw heavily on As We May Think by Vannevar Bush in 1945, which set out a vision not in terms of technology, but user experience.The term virtual library was initially used interchangeably with digital library, but is now primarily used for libraries that are virtual in other senses (such as libraries which aggregate distributed content).
A distinction is often made between content that was created in a digital format, known as born-digital, and information that has been converted from a physical medium, e.g. paper, by digitizing. It should also be noted that not all electronic content is in digital data format. The term hybrid library is sometimes used for libraries that have both physical collections and electronic collections. For example, American Memory is a digital library within the Library of Congress.
Some important digital libraries also serve as long term archives, such as arXiv and the Internet Archive.  Others, such as the Digital Public Library of America, seek to make digital information widely accessible through public libraries.Yi, Esther, Inside the Quest to Put the World's Libraries Online, The Atlantic, July 26, 2012.

[[Technical standard]]

[tpl]About|technical standards||Standards (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Standard[/tpl]
A technical standard is an established norm or requirement in regard to technical systems. It is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, processes and practices. In contrast, a custom, convention, company product, corporate standard, etc. that becomes generally accepted and dominant is often called a de facto standard. 
A technical standard can also be a controlled artifact or similar formal means used for calibration.  Reference Standards and certified reference materials have an assigned value by direct comparison with a reference base. A primary standard is usually under the jurisdiction of a national standards body. Secondary, tertiary, check standards and standard materials may be used for reference in a metrology system.  A key requirement in this case is (metrological) traceability, an unbroken paper trail of calibrations back to the primary standard.
A technical standard may be developed privately or unilaterally, for example by a corporation, regulatory body, military, etc.  Standards can also be developed by groups such as trade unions, and trade associations.  Standards organizations often have more diverse input and usually develop voluntary standards: these might become mandatory if adopted by a government, business contract, etc.
The standardization process may be by edict or may involve the formal consensusExample of TAPPI standards development regulations of technical experts.

CATEGORIES: Social networks, Distributed computing architecture, Peer-to-peer

A distributed social network or federated social network is an Internet social networking service that is decentralized and distributed across distinct providers. It consists of multiple social websites, where users of each site communicate with users of any of the involved sites. A social website participating in a distributed social network is interoperable with the other sites and is in federation with them. Communication among the social websites is technically conducted over social networking protocols. Software used for distributed social networking is generally portable[tpl]cref|a[/tpl] so it is easily adopted on various website platforms. Distributed social networks contrast with social network aggregation services, which are used to manage accounts and activities across multiple discrete social networks.
Open standards such as OAuth authorization, OpenID authentication, OStatus federation, XRD metadata discovery, the Portable Contacts protocol, the Wave Federation Protocol, the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (aka Jabber), OpenSocial widget APIs, microformats like XFN and hCard, and Atom web feeds—increasingly referred to together as the Open Stack—are often cited as enabling technologies for distributed social networking.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/daveman692/blowing-up-social-networks-by-going-open-presentation/ |title="Blowing Up" Social Networks by Going Open |accessdate=5 January 2009 |last=Recordon |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2008-10-09 |page=27 |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]
A few social networking service providers have used the term more broadly to describe provider-specific services that are distributable across different websites, typically through added widgets or plug-ins. Through the add-ons, the social network functionality is implemented on users' websites.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a U.S. legal defense organization and advocacy group for civil liberties on the Internet, endorses the distributed social network model as one "that can plausibly return control and choice to the hands of the Internet user" and allow persons living under restrictive regimes to "conduct activism on social networking sites while also having a choice of services and providers that may be better equipped to protect their security and anonymity".[tpl]cite web|url = https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/03/introduction-distributed-social-network|title = An Introduction to the Federated Social Network|date = March 21, 2012|author = Richard Esguerra|publisher = Electronic Frontier Foundation Deeplinks Blog[/tpl]

[[Read-only memory]]
CATEGORIES: Computer memory

Read-only memory (ROM) is a class of storage medium used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly or with difficulty, so it is mainly used to distribute firmware (software that is very closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates).
Strictly, read-only memory refers to memory that is hard-wired, such as diode matrix and the later mask ROM. Although discrete circuits can be altered (in principle), ICs cannot and are useless if the data are bad. Despite the simplicity, speed and economies of scale of mask ROM, field-programmability often make reprogrammable memories more flexible and inexpensive. [tpl]As of|2007[/tpl], actual ROM circuitry is therefore mainly used for applications such as microcode, and similar structures, on various kinds of processors.
Other types of non-volatile memory such as erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) and electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM or Flash ROM) are sometimes referred to, in an abbreviated way, as "read-only memory" (ROM); although these types of memory can be erased and re-programmed multiple times, writing to this memory takes longer and may require different procedures than reading the memory.Definition of: flash ROM, PC Magazine. When used in this less precise way, "ROM" indicates a non-volatile memory which serves functions typically provided by mask ROM, such as storage of program code and nonvolatile data.

[[Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]]
CATEGORIES: Computing legislation, Uniform Acts

''Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act'' (UCITA) was an attempt to introduce a Uniform Act for US States to follow. As a model law, it only specifies a set of guidelines, and each of the States should decide if to pass it or not, separately. UCITA has been drafted by National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jamesshuggins.com/h/tek1/ucita.htm |title=UCITA: Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act |website=James S. Huggins' Refrigerator Door |last=Huggins |first=James S. |date=October 25, 2002 |accessdate=June 8, 2013 [/tpl]
UCITA has been designed to clarify issues which were not addressed by existing Uniform Commercial Code. "Few disagree that the current Uniform Commercial Code is ill-suited for use with licensing and other intangible transactions," said practicing attorney Alan Fisch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/governmenttopics/government/legislation/story/0,10801,83870,00.html |title=Sponsor's surrender won't end UCITA battle |website=Computerworld |last=Thibodeau |first=Patrick |date=August 11, 2003 |accessdate=June 8, 2013 [/tpl]
UCITA has faced severe opposition from various groups.
UCITA has only been passed in two states, Virginia and Maryland. The law did not pass in other states. Nevertheless, legal scholars, such as noted commercial law professor Jean Braucher, believe that the UCITA offers academic value.
A resolution recommending approval of UCITA by the American Bar Association (ABA) has been withdrawn by the NCCUSL in 2003, indicating that UCITA lacks the consensus which is necessary for it to become a uniform law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/22575/ |title=UCITA withdrawn from the ABA |website=LWN.net |author= |date=February 12, 2003 |accessdate=June 8, 2013 [/tpl]

North Coast Women's Care Medical Group vs. Superior Court (44 Cal. 4th 1145) is a case decided before the California Supreme Court on August 19, 2008, ruling that physicians must offer IVF services to gays and lesbians despite religious objections or find a colleague in their office who will do so.
The suit was brought by Guadalupe Benitez, a lesbian from Oceanside, California, who was treated in 1999 for infertility at the only clinic in her area that accepted her insurance. Two physicians at the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group, Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton, refused to perform an artificial insemination treatment on Benitez because they claimed that such treatment to an unmarried person violated their Christian religious beliefs.
After she was denied treatment, Benitez argued in court that the physicians and the clinic really based their decision on her being a lesbian. This violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act, a state law prohibiting discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity covering places of business and public accommodation; marital status was not addressed until 2006. She won at the trial court level in San Diego, but that decision was later overturned by a state appeals court. The California State Supreme Court's decision favoring Benitez was unanimous.[tpl]cite news|last=Egelko|first=Bob|title=Doctors can't use bias to deny gays treatment|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-19/bay-area/17124235_1_california-doctors-lesbian-religious-freedom|accessdate=24 January 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 19, 2008[/tpl]

[[Hurricane Bob]]

Hurricane Bob was one of the costliest hurricanes in New England history. The second named storm and first hurricane of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season, Bob developed from an area of low pressure near The Bahamas on August 16. The depression steadily intensified, and became Tropical Storm Bob late on August 16. Bob curved north-northwestward as a tropical storm, but re-curved to the north-northeast after becoming a hurricane on August 17. As such, it brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on August 18 and August 19, and subsequently intensified into a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). After peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), Bob weakened slightly as it approached the coast of New England.
Bob made landfall twice in Rhode Island as a Category 2 hurricane on August 19, first on Block Island and then in Newport. Upon doing so, it became the only hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States during the 1991 season. Moving further inland, Bob rapidly weakened, and deteriorated to a tropical storm while emerging into the Gulf of Maine. Shortly thereafter, Bob made landfall in Maine as a strong tropical storm early on August 20. Bob entered the Canadian province of New Brunswick a few hours later, where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. By August 21, the remnants of Bob crossed Newfoundland and re-emerged into the open Atlantic Ocean. The remnants traveled a long distance across the northern Atlantic Ocean, and finally dissipated west of Portugal on August 29.   
Bob left extensive damage throughout New England in its wake, totaling approximately $1.5 billion (1991 USD, $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|1500000000|1991[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD). This made it the second costliest United States hurricane at the time; as of 2010, it ranked twenty-second in the category. In addition, seventeen fatalities were reported in association with Bob. The loss of life and most of the damage occurred as a result of high winds and rough seas. There were six confirmed tornadoes during its passage.

A mixtape, which usually reflects the musical tastes of its compiler, can range from a casually selected list of favorite songs, to a conceptual mix of songs linked by a theme or mood, to a highly personal statement tailored to the tape's intended recipient. Essayist Geoffrey O'Brien has called the personal mix tape "the most widely practiced American art form",[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.events-in-music.com/burnlist-mix-tapes.html| title=BurnLists: The Digital "Mix Tape" Comes Of Age| first=Michael| last=Resnick| year=2006| accessdate=2007-01-15[/tpl] and many mix tape enthusiasts believe that by carefully selecting and ordering the tracks in a mix, an artistic statement can be created that is greater than the sum of its individual songs.
With the advent of affordable, consumer-level digital audio, creating and distributing mixes in the form of compact disc or MP3 playlists has become the contemporary method of choice, but the term mix tape is still commonly used, even for mixes in different media (for example, CD, MP3, MiniDisc, audio cassette 8 track).[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] Video mixtapes have emerged as well.

[[Rosemonde Gérard]]

Louise-Rose-Étiennette Gérard, known as Rosemonde Gérard (April 5, 1871, Paris – July 8, 1953, Paris) was a French poet and playwright. She was the wife of Edmond Rostand (1868–1918, author of Cyrano de Bergerac), and was a granddaughter of Étienne Maurice Gérard, who was a Marshal and a Prime Minister of France.French Wikipedia: Rosemond Gérard; Edmond Rostand.
Gérard is perhaps best known today as the author of the lines:

thumb|A "+ qu'hier − que demain" pendant from about 1930. "A.Augis" is visible on the left edge of the central area.This couplet is taken from a poem, variously known as "L'éternelle chanson" ("The Eternal Song") or "Les Vieux" ("The Old Ones"), that she wrote to Rostand in 1889.See, for example, Iloveyou365. The poem was published in 1890, but did not enjoy immediate success. The phrase became celebrated as an expression of ever-growing love when, in 1907 (17 years after its publication), a Lyons jeweler, Alphonse Augis, had the idea of making a medallion with the core portion of the verse engraved on it.L’Internaute: Aujourd’hui plus qu’hier et bien moins que demain. The medallions became quite popular, and led to the production of other, similarly-decorated jewelry items, such as earrings and matchboxes; many older examples include Augis' name. A very common variation on the design presents the line with the words "plus" and "moins" replaced by the mathematical + and − signs, respectively. The mathematical signs are frequently rendered in tiny gemstones, often in contrasting colors.Adin antique jewelry: Plus qu'hier et moins que demain.
Among Gérard's other works is the play “A Good Little Devil” (1913), co-written with Maurice Rostand.IBDB: Rosemonde Gerard. It was made into a movie of the same name in 1914. Mary Pickford starred in both the play and the movie; she later opined that the movie was one of the worst—if not the worst—she had ever made.IMDB: A Good Little Devil.
Gérard and Rostand were married on April 8, 1890;Edmond Rostand. they had two sons, Maurice (1891–1968) and Jean Rostand (1894–1977). In later years, Gérard and Maurice Rostand frequented an intellectual circle that included Jean-Paul Sartre and Gilbert Martineau.
It has been said that Gérard "doubtless would have been famous had not her husband's star so far eclipsed her own."Theatrehistory.com: Edmond Rostand. After 35 years of widowhood, she died in 1953 and is buried at Cimetiere de Passy, in Paris, as is her son Maurice.Find A Grave: Rosemonde Gerard.

Appropriation in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them.Chilvers, Ian & Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 27-28 The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the history of the arts (literary, visual, musical and performing arts). In the visual arts, to appropriate means to properly adopt, borrow, recycle or sample aspects (or the entire form) of human-made visual culture. Notable in this respect are the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp.  
Inherent in our understanding of appropriation is the concept that the new work recontextualises whatever it borrows to create the new work. In most cases the original 'thing' remains accessible as the original, without change.

[[Independence County, Washington]]

CATEGORIES: Proposed counties of the United States

Independence County is a proposed county to be created from the northwest corner of Whatcom County, Washington. The proposal had the most momentum in the county elections of 1993, when secessionist interests won a majority of votes on the County Council. 
The Independence County proposal, like other county secession proposals in Washington, was organized by construction and development interests (under the banner of property rights), hoping that a separate county would redefine county zoning and land use plans to encourage new development. Proponents of the new county took advantage of rural landowners' perception of tax flow: that property taxes had increased unreasonably in order to foot the bill for infrastructure development in the county seat of Bellingham, Washington. This assertion was bolstered by studies on three of Washington's county creation proposals (including Independence) undertaken by UW Professor Richard Zerbe, but refuted by Whatcom County Assessor Keith Wilnauer.
In 1994 the Independence County movement was based in Deming, Washington, organized by Doug Howard, a preacher, retail landowner, and mortgage lender. The Independence movement had ties to the Wise Use Movement, and anti-environmental interest group. The Independence movement also had ties to other county secession movements in Washington including Freedom, Pioneer, and Skykomish county proposals.
Petitions to propose that Independence County be created were circulated around the proposed area between 1993 and 1994. Many signatories believed that they were signing an initiative to be placed on an upcoming ballot, but it was only a petition to the legislature.
After the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission secured a disclosure hearing into the lobbying actions and finances of the organized Cedar County, Washington movement, the Independence County organized movement (as well as those of other Washington county secession movements) shut down in 1994.

Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation, 280 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2002) withdrawn, re-filed at 336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir. 2003), is a U.S. court case between a commercial photographer and a search engine company. During the case ownership of Arriba Soft changed to Sorceron, the operator of the Internet search engine Ditto.com.  The court found that US search engines may use thumbnails of images (size limits not determined), though the issue of inline linking to full size images instead of going to the original site was not resolved.

[[Air Pirates]]

CATEGORIES: Underground cartoonists, Disney comics, Parodies, Underground comix, Comics-related organizations, Culture jamming

The Air Pirates were a group of cartoonists who created two issues of an underground comic called Air Pirates Funnies in 1971, leading to a famous lawsuit by The Walt Disney Company (then Walt Disney Productions).[tpl]cite book|author=Tom Sito|authorlink=Tom Sito|title=Drawing the Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XZ0PsCWPSZ0C|date=October 6, 2006|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7148-2|pages=236–37[/tpl] Founded by Dan O'Neill, the group also included Shary Flenniken, Bobby London, Gary Hallgren, and Ted Richards.
The collective shared a common interest in the styles of past masters of the comic strip, and in creating their stories for the collective each set out to imitate the style of an old time cartoonist: Flenniken emulated Clare Briggs and H. T. Webster[tpl]cite book|author=Patrick Rosenkranz|title=Rebel visions: the underground comix revolution, 1963-1975|url=http://books.google.com/books?lr=&ei=zuchSp_yEYbikwTq9qnzDA&as_brr=0&id=tn9QAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Larry+Welz%22&q=%22H.+T.+Webster%22|year=2002|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|isbn=978-1-56097-464-2[/tpl]  in her Trots and Bonnie comics, London's strip Dirty Duck paid homage to the style of George Herriman's Krazy Kat,  Richards' Dopin' Dan was supposed to be influenced by Bud Fisher but showed more similarity to Mort Walker's Beetle Bailey, and Gary Hallgren drew a strip called Pollyanna Pals in the style of Cliff Sterrett's Polly and Her Pals.  The original Air Pirates were a gang of Mickey Mouse antagonists of the 1930s; O'Neill imagined Mickey Mouse to be a symbol of conformist hypocrisy in American culture, and therefore a ripe target for satire.
The first issue of Air Pirates Funnies was dated July 1971, and the second issue dated August. Both were published under the Hell Comics imprint, and were distributed through Ron Turner's Last Gasp publishing company.  Both issues are considered highly collectible today.
The lead stories in both issues, created by O'Neill, Bobby London and Hallgren, focused on Walt Disney characters, most notably from Floyd Gottfredson's Mickey Mouse newspaper strip, with the Disney characters engaging in adult behaviors such as sex and drug consumption. O'Neill insisted it would dilute the parody to change the names of the characters, so his adventurous mouse character was called "Mickey". Ted Richards took on the Big Bad Wolf and the Three Little Pigs opening up a second wave of parody attacking Disney's use of  contemporary American and European folklore. In doing so, they infringed Disney's copyrights by using characters he created without permission.

Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 252 F. 3d 1165 (11th Cir. 2001), opinion at 268 F.3d 1257, was a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit against the owner of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, vacating an injunction prohibiting the publisher of Alice Randall's The Wind Done Gone from distributing the book. 
This case arguably stands for the principle that the creation and publication of a carefully written parody novel in the United States counts as fair use. Despite stating that substantial portions of Mitchell's work were used, the Court of Appeals found that the likely outcome of a full adjudication of the rights involved was a finding of fair use.  In permitting parody without permission, the decision follows the previous United States Supreme Court decision in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. which ruled that 2 Live Crew's unlicensed use of the bass line from Roy Orbison's song "Oh, Pretty Woman" could constitute fair use even though the work was a commercial use, and extends that principle from songs to novels. It is binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.
Mitchell's estate chose to drop the suit after publisher Houghton agreed to make a donation to Morehouse College."Mitchell Estate Settles Gone With the Wind Suit," The New York Times May 10, 2002; Settlement reached over Wind Done Gone, The Associated Press, May 10, 2002.

The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is an international agreement administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation as applied to nationals of other WTO Members.See TRIPS Art. 1(3). It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994.
The TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the international trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive international agreement on intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing countries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow reading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the Doha Declaration. The Doha declaration is a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of the goal "to promote access to medicines for all."
Specifically, TRIPS requires WTO members to provide copyright rights, covering content producers including performers, producers of sound recordings and broadcasting organizations; geographical indications, including appellations of origin; industrial designs; integrated circuit layout-designs; patents;  new plant varieties; trademarks; trade dress; and undisclosed or confidential information. TRIPS also specifies enforcement procedures, remedies, and dispute resolution procedures. Protection and enforcement of all intellectual property rights shall meet the objectives to contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.

The directive was enacted under the internal market provisions of the Treaty of Rome.
The directive was subject to unprecedented lobbying[tpl]cite journal |last=Hugenholtz |first=Bernt |year=2000 |title=Why the Copyright Directive is Unimportant, and Possibly Invalid |journal=European Intellectual Property Review |pages=501 |url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/opinion-EIPR.html[/tpl] and has been cited as a success for copyright industries.For that, and contrary views: Ginsburg, Jane C., "Can Copyright Become User-Friendly?

[[Plunderphonics]]

CATEGORIES: Musical techniques, Sampling, Canadian styles of music

Plunderphonics is a term coined by composer John Oswald in 1985 in his essay Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative. It has since been applied to any music made by taking one or more existing audio recordings and altering them in some way to make a new composition. Plunderphonics can be considered a form of sound collage.
Although the concept of plunderphonics is seemingly broad, in practice there are many common themes used in what is normally called plunderphonic music. This includes heavy sampling of educational films of the 1950s, news reports, radio shows, or anything with trained vocal announcers. Oswald's contributions to this genre rarely used these materials, the exception being his rap-like 1975 track "Power."
The process of sampling other sources is found in various genres (notably hip-hop and especially turntablism), but in plunderphonic works the sampled material is often the only sound used. These samples are usually uncleared, and sometimes result in legal action being taken due to copyright infringement. Some plunderphonic artists use their work to protest what they consider to be overly-restrictive copyright laws. Many plunderphonic artists claim their use of other artists' materials falls under the fair use doctrine.
A development of the process is when creative musicians plunder an original track and overlay new material and sounds on top until the original piece is masked and then removed, though often using scales and beat. A studio based technique used by the American experimental band The Residents (who used Beatles tracks) and the UK band The Perrinormal who have plundered many tracks from classical, folk, rock and jazz but rarely reveal which, except their Hey Joe tribute to Jimi Hendrix. Often the new track has little resemblance to the original, this prevents the musician from infringing copyright but results in a more creative and original piece.

[[Content Scramble System]]
CATEGORIES: History of cryptography, Digital rights management, Compact Disc and DVD copy protection, Broken stream ciphers, DVD, History of television, Digital rights management standards

Content Scramble System (CSS) is a digital rights management (DRM) and encryption system employed on almost all commercially produced DVD-Video discs. CSS utilizes a proprietary 40-bit stream cipher algorithm. The system was introduced around 1996 and was first compromised in 1999.
The purpose of CSS is twofold:
While most CSS-decrypting software is used to play DVD videos, other pieces of software (such as DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD, DVD43, Smartripper, and DVD Shrink) can copy a DVD to a hard drive and remove Macrovision, CSS encryption, region codes, and user operation prohibition.
CSS has been superseded by newer DRM schemes such as Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM), or by Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) DRM scheme used by HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc, which have 56-bit and 128-bit key sizes, respectively, providing a much higher level of security than the weak 40-bit key size of CSS.

Doctrine (from [tpl]lang-la|doctrina[/tpl] or possibly from Sanskrit: dukrn) is a codification of beliefs or a body of teachings or instructions, taught principles or positions, as the body of teachings in a branch of knowledge or belief system. The Greek analogue is the etymology of catechism.Doctrine - Definition at WordIQ.com 2010
Often doctrine specifically suggests a body of religious principles as it is promulgated by a church, but not necessarily: doctrine is also used to refer to a principle of law, in the common law traditions, established through a history of past decisions, such as the doctrine of self-defense, or the principle of fair use, or the more narrowly applicable first-sale doctrine. In some organizations, doctrine is simply defined as "that which is taught", in other words the basis for institutional teaching of its personnel internal ways of doing business.

The Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) is United States federal law that creates a conditional safe harbor for online service providers (OSP) (a group which includes internet service providers (ISP)) and other Internet intermediaries by shielding them for their own acts of direct copyright infringement (when they make unauthorized copies) as well as shielding them from potential secondary liability for the infringing acts of others. OCILLA was passed as a part of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and is sometimes referred to as the "Safe Harbor" provision or as "DMCA 512" because it added Section 512 to Title 17 of the United States Code. By exempting Internet intermediaries from copyright infringement liability provided they follow certain rules, OCILLA attempts to strike a balance between the competing interests of copyright owners and digital users.

The Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act, often abbreviated to just INDUCE Act, is a bill introduced in the United States Senate which targets "whoever intentionally induces any violation" of copyright.  The name came from an earlier version named the "Inducement Devolves into Unlawful Child Exploitation Act."   
The proposed legislation was introduced as S. 2560 by Senator Orrin Hatch on June 22, 2004, and was then referred to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
The Act would amend title 17 of the United States Code which is related to copyrights, by adding a subsection to the end of section 501. The subsection would state the following:

The bill is broad and could lead to prosecution of peer to peer software makers, web sites or the overturning of home recording and fair use rights pioneered by the famous Betamax case. Many critics fear that certain tools used today (such as CD ripping and burning software), and even the Internet and personal computers themselves, could be considered to "intentionally induce" copyright violations, despite their utility for fair use purposes. 
The bill is sponsored by former Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican senator from Utah, though it also has support from other Democrats and Republicans, including

Ocean turbidity is a measure of the amount of cloudiness or haziness in sea water caused by individual particles that are too small to be seen without magnification. Highly turbid ocean waters are those with a large number of scattering particulates in them. In both highly absorbing and highly scattering waters, visibility into the water is reduced. The highly scattering (turbid) water still reflects a lot of light while the highly absorbing water, such as a blackwater river or lake, is very dark. The scattering particles that cause the water to be turbid can be composed of many things, including sediments and phytoplankton.

[[Hymn (software)]]
CATEGORIES: Free audio software, ITunes

Hymn (stylized as hymn), which stands for Hear Your Music aNywhere is a piece of computer software, and the successor to the PlayFair program. The purpose of Hymn, according to its author (who is currently anonymous for fear of legal proceedings), is to allow people to exercise their fair use rights under United States copyright law.
The program allows the user to remove the FairPlay DRM restrictions of music bought from the iTunes Store.
Most DRM removal programs rely on re-compressing the media that is captured after it is output by iTunes. This causes some loss in quality. However, Hymn can remove DRM with no reduction in sound quality, since it captures the raw AAC stream generated by iTunes as it opens each song, and saves this data using a compression structure identical to that of the original file, preserving both the quality and the small file size. The resultant files can then be played outside of the iTunes environment, including operating systems not supported by iTunes. It works (with a plugged-in iPod) on Mac OS X, on many Unix variants, and also on Windows (with or without an iPod).
The Mac OS X version includes a drag-and-drop graphical user interface. All other platforms have only a command-line interface at this time. Prebuilt binaries are available for both Mac OS X and Windows, and the source code is available for all platforms. There is also a Java-based GUI version of the program called JHymn.
The program and its source code are available under the GNU General Public License.
JHymn superseded Hymn as the official software of The Hymn Project.
The Hymn website has announced that, because users can no longer purchase music using iTunes 5 or older, removal of iTunes DRM for now is best accomplished with the use of MyFairTunes6 or QTFairUse6.http://Hymn-project.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1314[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] These programs currently work with the latest version of iTunes (8.0.1 as of 3 October 2008).

Vaskidovich was born under the name Manolaki Vaskidi in the city of Melnik. He studied at the Greek school in his hometown and at the Greek high school on Chios island. Vaskidovich finished the Bey's Academy in Bucharest. In 1815, he founded the first Hellenic-Bulgarian school in the Bulgarian lands in the Danubian town of Svishtov. He later organized the first school library in Bulgaria, to which he left his 800 volumes of literature. In 1832, Vaskidovich introduced the Bell-Lancaster method to the Svishtov school, where grammar, arithmetic and geography were taught. Until 1845, he was the head teacher of Svishtov; in that year, he was expelled under the pressure of the Grecoman party in the town only to return to his post between 1854 and 1863. In the interim, he worked as a teacher in Pleven.
Vaskidovich aided Neofit Bozveli in his publishing of the pedagogical book Slavenobolgarskoe Detevodstvo in 1835. He was the author of 15 textbooks and books, as well as grammar of the Ancient Greek language. He was also an active public figure, representing the Svishtov municipality in Wallachia, Constantinople and Vienna.

[[Easement]]

CATEGORIES: Real property law, Freedom to roam

An easement is a non-possessory right of use and/or entry onto the real property of another without possessing it. It is "best typified in the right of way which one landowner, A, may enjoy over the land of another, B."[tpl]cite book|last=Gray, Gray|first=Kevin, Susan Francis|title=Elements of Land Law|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=13[/tpl] It is similar to real covenants and equitable servitudes;Integration of the Law of Easements, Real Covenants and Equitable Servitudes. Washington Law Review. in the United States, the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes.Hernandez MV. (2005). Restating Implied, Prescriptive, and Statutory Easements. Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal.
Easements are helpful for providing pathways across two or more pieces of property or allowing an individual to fish in a privately owned pond. An easement is considered as a property right in itself at common law and is still treated as a type of property in most jurisdictions.
The rights of an easement holder vary substantially among jurisdictions. Historically, the common law courts would enforce only four types of easement: 
Modern courts recognize more varieties of easements, but these original categories still form the foundation of easement law.

[[Derivative work]]

CATEGORIES: Copyright law, Fair use

In copyright law, a derivative work is an expressive creation that includes major, copyright-protected elements of an original, previously created first work (the underlying work). The derivative work becomes a second, separate work independent in form from the first. The transformation, modification or adaption of the work must be substantial and bear its author's personality to be original and thus protected by copyright. Translations, cinematic adaptions and musical arrangements are common types of derivative works.   
Most countries' legal systems seek to protect both works. They grant authors the right to impede or otherwise control their integrity and the author's commercial interests. Derivatives and their authors benefit in turn from the full protection of copyright without prejudicing the rights of the original work's author.

[[Legal aspects of computing]]
CATEGORIES: Computer law, Information technology

Legal aspects of computing are related to the overlapping areas of law and computing.
The first one, historically, was information technology law (or IT law). ("IT law" should not be confused with the IT aspects of law itself, although there are overlapping issues.)  IT law consists of the law (statutes, regulations, and caselaw) which governs the digital dissemination of both (digitalized) information and software itself (see history of free and open-source software), and legal aspects of information technology more broadly.  IT law covers mainly the digital information (including information security and electronic commerce) aspects and it has been described as "paper laws" for a "paperless environment".
Cyberlaw or Internet law is a term that encapsulates the legal issues related to use of the Internet. It is less a distinct field of law than intellectual property or contract law, as it is a domain covering many areas of law and regulation.  Some leading topics include internet access and usage, privacy, freedom of expression, and jurisdiction.
"Computer law" is a third term which tends to relate to issues including both Internet law and the patent and copyright aspects of computer technology and software.

[[Exclusive right]]

CATEGORIES: Common law, Rights

In Anglo-Saxon law, an exclusive right is a de facto, non-tangible prerogative existing in law (that is, the power or, in a wider sense, right) to perform an action or acquire a benefit and to permit or deny others the right to perform the same action or to acquire the same benefit. A "prerogative" is in effect an exclusive right. The term is restricted for use for official state or sovereign (i.e., constitutional) powers. Exclusive rights are a form of monopoly.
Exclusive rights can be established by law or by contractual obligation, but the scope of enforceability will depend upon the extent to which others are bound by the instrument establishing the exclusive right; thus in the case of contractual rights, only persons that are parties to a contract will be affected by the exclusivity.
Exclusive rights may be granted in property law, copyright law, patent law,  in relation to public utilities, or, in some jurisdictions, in other sui generis legislation. Many scholars argue that such rights form the basis for the concepts of property and ownership.
Privately granted rights, created by contract, may occasionally appear very similar to exclusive rights, but are only enforceable against the grantee, and not the world at large.

[[Philosophy of copyright]]
CATEGORIES: Copyright law, Ethics, Philosophy of law, Philosophy by field

The philosophy of copyright might be said to include several philosophical issues which are fundamentally linked to copyright policy, and other jurisprudential problems that arise in legal systems' interpretation and application of copyright law.
Probably the most profound and widely debated philosophical issue amongst scholars of copyright law, is its purpose.  Some take the approach of looking for coherent justifications of established copyright systems, while others start with general ethical theories, such as utilitarianism and try to analyse policy through that lens.  Another approach denies the meaningfulness of any ethical justification for existing copyright law, viewing it simply as a result (and perhaps an undesirable result) of political processes.
Another widely debated issue is the relationship between copyrights and other forms of "intellectual property", and material property.  Most scholars of copyright agree that it can be called a kind of property, because it involves the exclusion of others from something.  But there is disagreement about the extent to which that fact should allow the transportation of other beliefs and intuitions about material possessions.
There are many other philosophical questions which arise in the jurisprudence of copyright.  They include such problems as determining when one work is "derived" from another, or deciding when information has been placed in a "tangible" or "material" form.

[[Fair dealing]]
CATEGORIES: Copyright law

Fair dealing is  a limitation and exception to the exclusive right granted by copyright law to the author of a creative work,   which is found in many of the common law jurisdictions of the Commonwealth of Nations.
Fair dealing is an enumerated set of possible defences against an action for infringement of an exclusive right of copyright. Unlike the related United States doctrine of fair use, fair dealing cannot apply to any act which does not fall within one of these categories. In practice, common law courts might rule that actions with a commercial character, which might be naïvely assumed to fall into one of these categories, were in fact infringements of copyright as fair dealing is not as flexible a concept as the American concept of fair use.

The term is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights, in which case use of the work is referred to as "under license" or "with permission".
In informal usage, the public domain consists of works that are publicly available; while according to the formal definition, it consists of works that are unavailable for private ownership or are available for public use. As rights are country-based and vary, a work may be subject to rights in one country and not in another. Some rights depend on registrations with a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, implies public domain status in that country.
Public Domain is one of the traditional safety valves in copyright law.

[[Arctostylopida]]

CATEGORIES: Paleocene mammals, Eocene mammals

Arctostylopida is an extinct order of placental mammals from the Late Palaeocene of Eastern Asia and North America. All arctostylopid specimens in North America have been referred to the genus Arctostylops.
They are animals of uncertain affinities to other groups and it was believed that they may be related to 'ungulates'.http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/510Ungulatomorpha/510.200.html#Arctostylopida Originally they were considered to be northern relatives of South American notoungulates, specifically Notostylopidae. Recently, other palaeontologists Missiaen, P., T. Smith, D. Y. Guo, J. I. Bloch, and P. D. Gingerich. 2006. Asian gliriform origin for arctostylopid mammals. Naturwissen-schaften 93:407–411. have suggested that they might be descendants of Asian gliriforms, and therefore related to rabbits and rodents.
This relationship is based upon similarities in the shape of their tarsal (ankle) bones. In particular, arctostylopid tarsals bear a strong resemblance to the early gliroid Rhombomylus.

Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984), also known as the “Betamax case”, is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled that the making of individual copies of complete television shows for purposes of time shifting does not constitute copyright infringement, but is fair use.  The Court also ruled that the manufacturers of home video recording devices, such as Betamax or other VCRs (referred to as VTRs in the case), cannot be liable for infringement.  The case was a boon to the home video market as it created a legal safe haven for the technology, which also significantly benefited the entertainment industry through the sale of pre-recorded movies.
The broader legal consequence of the Court's decision was its establishment of a general test for determining whether a device with copying or recording capabilities ran afoul of copyright law.  This test has created some interpretative challenges to courts in applying the case to more recent file sharing technologies available for use on home computers and over the Internet.

[[Limitations and exceptions to copyright]]

CATEGORIES: Copyright law, Intellectual property law

Limitations and exceptions to copyright are provisions in copyright law which allow for copyrighted works to be used without a license from the copyright owner.
Limitations and exceptions to copyright relate to a number of important considerations such as market failure, freedom of speech,P. Bernt Hugenholtz. Copyright And Freedom Of Expression In Europe (2001) Published in: Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss, Harry First and Diane Leenheer Zimmerman (eds.), Expanding the Boundaries of Intellectual Property,  Oxford University Press education and equality of access (such as by the visually impaired). Some view limitations and exceptions as "user rights" - seeing user rights as providing an essential balance to the rights of the copyright owners. There is no consensus among copyright experts as to whether user rights are rights or simply limitations on copyright. See for example the National Research Council's Digital Agenda Report, note 1. The concept of user rights has also been recognised by courts, including the Canadian Supreme Court in CCH Canadian Ltd v. Law Society of Upper Canada (2004 SCC 13), which classed "fair dealing" as such a user right. These kinds of disagreements in philosophy are quite common in the philosophy of copyright, where debates about jurisprudential reasoning tend to act as proxies for more substantial disagreements about good policy.

 Johann Georg Christian, Fürst von Lobkowitz (or Lobkowicz), (August 10, 1686 – Wien October 4, 1755) was an Austrian Generalfeldmarschall.
He was descended from the old Bohemian aristocratic family of Lobkowicz, and was the fourth son of Philipp Hyazinth Josef, who was the Prince of Lobkowicz, and Duke of Sagan (1680–1737) and Eleonore Katharina Charlotte Popel von Lobkowicz (1685–1712). 
Johan Georg Chritian was married on November 11, 1718, in Prague, to Caroline Henriette von Waldstein (1702–1780) and they had 10 children. Two of their sons were killed in battle and two other sons became Knights in the Order of the Golden Fleece.
Johann Georg Christian was the founder of the (Hořín)/Mělník branch in the Lobkowitz-family. 
He later fought under Eugene of Savoy against the Turks. 
In 1732 he became Governor of Sicily, and on November 28, 1739 was made a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. 
In 1741 he attained the rank of Field Marshal.
During the War of the Austrian Succession, he first fought the French and Bavarians between Prague and Munich, and was later Governor of the Duchy of Milan between 1743 and 1745, and  Imperial army commander in Italy, where he lost the Battle of Velletri (1744).
In 1745 Christoph Willibald Gluck accepted an invitation to become house composer at London's King's Theatre, travelling to England in the company of Georg Christian. Either Gluck or Lobkowitz bought a copy of Handel's Messiah.This copy was used around 1789 by Mozart for his adaption of this oratorio (K. 572).

[[Analog hole]]

CATEGORIES: Digital rights management

The analog hole (also known as the analog loophole) is a fundamental and inevitable vulnerability in copy protection schemes for noninteractive works in digital formats which can be exploited to duplicate copy-protected works that are ultimately reproduced using analog means.  Once digital information is converted to a human-perceptible (analog) form, it is a relatively simple matter to digitally recapture that analog reproduction in an unrestricted form, thereby fundamentally circumventing any and all restrictions placed on copyrighted digitally distributed work.  Media publishers who use digital rights management (DRM), to restrict how a work can be used, perceive the necessity to make it visible and/or audible as a "hole" in the control that DRM otherwise affords them.

[[My postillion has been struck by lightning]]
CATEGORIES: Language education, English phrases

"My postillion has been struck by lightning", "Our postillion has been struck by lightning", and other variations on the same pattern, are often given as examples of the ridiculous phrases supposed to have been found in phrase books or language instruction in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The word postillion may occur in its alternative spelling postilion.  
Although various forms of the sentence are widely cited, the exact wording and the context in which it is said to have originally been used vary.  For example, a teaching manual attributes it to a Portuguese-English phrasebook: The phrase-book for Portuguese learners of English which included the often-quoted and bizarre sentence  'Pardon me, but your postillion has been struck by lightning' demonstrates a total lack of sense of context: who can have said this, to whom and in what circumstances?   
By contrast a linguistics textbook mentions the supposedly "apocryphal" phrase during a description of foreign language teaching in "the schoolrooms of Europe at the close of the nineteenth century": Sentences—especially constructed to contain only the grammar and vocabulary which had already been covered—were laboriously translated, in writing, into and out of the student's first language. Such sentences, often bizarrely remote from any conceivable use, have been the occasion for jokes ever since.  We have probably all heard references to the apocryphal "My postilion has been struck by lightning" and the infamous plume de ma tante.

[[Time shifting]]
CATEGORIES: Copyright law, Digital television, Television terminology, Technology neologisms

Time shifting is the recording of programming to a storage medium to be viewed or listened to at a time more convenient to the consumer. Typically, this refers to TV programming but can also refer to radio shows via podcasts.
In recent years, the advent of the digital video recorder (DVR) has made time shifting easier, by using an electronic program guide (EPG)  and recording shows onto a hard disk. Some DVRs have other possible time shifting methods, such as being able to start watching the recorded show from the beginning even if the recording is not yet complete. In the past, time shifting was done with a video cassette recorder (VCR) and its timer function, in which the VCR tunes into the appropriate station and records the show onto video tape. 
Freesat+, Freeview+, Sky+, V+, TiVo, YouView and BT Vision services in Ireland and the UK allow one to timeshift. TiVo, DirecTV, and other US cable or satellite subscription services offer PVR set-top boxes, often for an additional monthly fee. DStv, based in South Africa, offers PVR set-top boxes to countries across Africa which allow time shifting of live and recorded television.
In cable television broadcasting, time shifting may also refer to the availability of network affiliates from different time zones, serving a similar function of making television programs available at multiple times throughout the day.
Certain broadcasters transmit timeshifted versions of their channels, usually one hour in the future, to enable those without recording abilities to resolve conflicts and those with recording abilities more flexibility in scheduling conflicting recordings. (See timeshift channel.)

Juliet Hall Worth Stillman Severance (De Ruyter, Madison County, New York, 1 July 1833 - New York, 3 September 1919) was an American physician and feminist of the 19th century. 
She was one of the first woman physicians of the United States, having graduated in 1858. She opposed slavery, death penalty and abortion and supported the temperance. She was the leader of several Labour organizations. In the biographical dictionary Women of the Century (1893), she is called "a radical of the radicals" and also "a model mother and a housekeeper".
She campaigned for women rights and the right to life of the unborn child, believing that marriage and motherhood should be affirming choices for women. In her article, "Is the Present Marriage System a Failure?", published in the progressive Chicago newspaper Universe on 28 August 1869, she states: "Marriage should be a soul-union, not a curse ... not a merging of one life into another, but ... two individuals uniting their lives for mutual good and the good of humanity — it may be in reproduction, or it may be in giving birth to higher, nobler ideas, and outworking them in noble deeds and grand achievements .... There is not a child in a hundred that is begotten with the consent of the mother. As the present marriage system makes man the owner of woman — her legal master — she is expected to submit to his gratification .... When the marriage system is what it should be, and woman controls in these matters, instead of man ... Restellism abortion shall cease, because there will be no demand for it."Profile of Juliet Stillman Severance at Feminists for Life Official Website

[[Photocopier]]

CATEGORIES: American inventions, 1949 introductions, Office equipment, Computer peripherals, Photocopiers

A photocopier (also known as a copier or copy machine) is a machine that makes paper copies of documents and other visual images quickly and cheaply. Most current photocopiers use a technology called xerography, a dry process  that uses electrostatic charges on a light sensitive photoreceptor to first attract and then transfer toner particles (a powder) onto paper in the form of an image.  Heat, pressure or a combination of both is then used to fuse the toner onto the paper. (Copiers can also use other technologies such as ink jet, but xerography is standard for office copying.)
Xerographic office photocopying was introduced by Xerox in 1959,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.xerox.com/go/xrx/template/019d.jsp?view=Factbook&id=Historical&Xcntry=USA&Xlang=en_US | title = Factbook [/tpl] and it gradually replaced copies made by Verifax, Photostat, carbon paper, mimeograph machines, and other duplicating machines. The prevalence of its use is one of the factors that prevented the development of the paperless office heralded early in the digital revolution[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl].
Photocopying is widely used in business, education, and government.  There have been many predictions that photocopiers will eventually become obsolete as information workers continue to increase their digital document creation and distribution, and rely less on distributing actual pieces of paper.

The Associated Press (AP) is an American multinational nonprofit news agency headquartered in New York City. The AP is owned by its contributing newspapers, radio, and television stations in the United States, all of which contribute stories to the AP and use material written by its staff journalists. The AP staff is represented by the Newspaper Guild union, which operates under the Communication Workers union, which operates under the AFL-CIO. 
[tpl]As of|2005[/tpl], the news collected by the AP is published and republished by more than 1,700 newspapers, in addition to more than 5,000 television and radio broadcasters. The photograph library of the AP consists of over 10 million images. The Associated Press operates 243 news bureaus and it serves at least 120 countries, with an international staff located worldwide. Associated Press also operates The Associated Press Radio Network, which provides newscasts twice hourly for broadcast and satellite radio and television stations. The AP Radio also offers news and public affairs features, feeds of news sound bites, and long form coverage of major events. Many newspapers and broadcasters outside the United States are AP subscribers, paying a fee to use AP material without being contributing members of the cooperative. That places AP's unionized staff in a position to strongly influence public opinion.
As part of their cooperative agreement with The Associated Press, most member news organizations grant automatic permission for the AP to distribute their local news reports. For example, on page two of every edition of The Washington Post, the newspaper's masthead includes the statement, "The Associated Press is entitled exclusively to use for re-publication of all news dispatches credited to it or not otherwise credited in this paper and all local news of spontaneous origin published herein."
The AP employs the "inverted pyramid formula" for writing that enables the news outlets to edit a story to fit its available publication area without losing the story's essential meaning and news information.
Cutbacks at longtime U.S. rival United Press International, most significantly in 1993, left the AP as the primary nationally oriented news service based in the United States, although UPI still produces and distributes news stories and photos daily. Other English-language news services, such as Reuters and the English-language service of Agence France-Presse, are based outside the United States.

Cascades-Malignes is an unorganized territory in the Outaouais region of Quebec, Canada, one of five unorganized territories in the La Vallée-de-la-Gatineau Regional County Municipality.
The territory is named after the Cascades Malignes (French for "Malicious Cascades") which are a series of chutes on the Gens de Terre River.

[[Cinema of the Republic of Macedonia]]
CATEGORIES: Cinema of the Republic of Macedonia

The history of film making in the Republic of Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by Janaki and Milton Manaki in Bitola. From then, continuing to the present, Macedonian film makers, in Macedonia and from around the world, have been producing many films. The country now produces three or four films per year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-macedonia-bows-foreign-language-634305 |title=Oscars: Macedonia Bows Out of Foreign Language Category Race |accessdate=2013-09-23 |work=Hollywood Reporter[/tpl]
Throughout the past century, the medium of film has depicted the history, culture and everyday life of the Macedonian people. Over the years many Macedonian films have been presented at film festivals around the world and several of these films have won prestigious awards. 
The first Macedonian feature film was Frosina, released in 1952. The screenplay was written by Vlado Maleski, who wrote the lyrics for the Macedonian national anthem, and it was directed by Kiro Bilbilovski. The first feature film in colour was Miss Stone, a movie about a Protestant missionary in Ottoman Macedonia. It was released in 1958.
The most famous Macedonian director is Milčo Mančevski, whose debut feature film Before the Rain was nominated for an Academy Award. 
The highest grossing feature film in the Republic of Macedonia was Bal-Can-Can, having been seen by over 500,000 people in its first year alone.

[tpl]About|reusing existing sound recordings in creating new works|other uses|Sampling (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Sampling|and|Sample (disambiguation)[/tpl]
thumb|250px|DJ Premier looking through vinyl records|alt=American producer "DJ Premier" Looking through his vinyl record collection for potential samples|DJ Premier looking for samples he can use In music, sampling is the act of taking a portion, or sample, of one sound recording and reusing it as an instrument or a sound recording in a different song or piece.
Originally developed by experimental musicians working with musique concrète and electroacoustic music, who physically manipulated tape loops or vinyl records on a phonograph by the late 1960s, the use of tape loop sampling influenced the development of minimalist music and the production of psychedelic rock and jazz fusion.
However, hip hop music was the first popular music genre based on the art of sampling - being born from 1970s DJs who experimented with manipulating vinyl on two turntables and an audio mixer.[tpl]cite web|last=Lott|first=Ryan|title=History of Sampling|url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/akai-mpc-2000the-history-of-sampling/|publisher=Joyful Noise Recordings|accessdate=27 September 2013[/tpl]  The use of sampling in popular music spread with the rise of electronic music and disco in the mid-1970s to early 1980s, the development of electronic dance music and industrial music in the 1980s, and the worldwide influence of hip hop since the 1980s on genres ranging from contemporary R&B to indie rock. Sampling is now most often done with a sampler, originally a piece of hardware, but today, more commonly a computer program. However, vinyl emulation software may also be used, and turntablists continue to sample using traditional methods. The inclusion of sampling tools in modern digital production methods increasingly introduced sampling into many genres of popular music, as well as genres predating the invention of sampling, such as classical music, jazz and various forms of traditional music.
Often "samples" consist of one part of a song, such as a rhythm break, which is then used to construct the beat for another song. For instance, hip hop music developed from DJs repeating the breaks from songs to enable continuous dancing.Schloss, Joseph G. (2004). Making Beats: The Art of Sample-Based Hip Hop, p.36. Middletown, Connecticut: Wesleyan University Press. ISBN 0-8195-6696-9. The Funky drummer break and the Amen break, both brief fragments taken from soul and funk music recordings of the 1960s, have been among the most common samples used in dance music and hip hop of recent decades, with some entire subgenres like breakbeat being based largely on complex permutations of a single one of these samples. Samples from rock recordings have also been the basis of new songs; for example, the drum introduction from Led Zeppelin's "When the Levee Breaks" was sampled by the Beastie Boys, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Mike Oldfield, Rob Dougan, Coldcut, Depeche Mode and Erasure, among others. Often, samples are not taken from other music, but from spoken words, including those in non-musical media such as movies, TV shows and advertising.
Sampling does not necessarily mean using pre-existing recordings. A number of composers and musicians have constructed pieces or songs by sampling field recordings they made themselves, and others have sampled their own original recordings. The musicians in the trip hop band Portishead, for example, made some use of existing samples, but also scratched, manipulated and sampled musical parts they themselves had originally played in order to construct their songs.
The use of sampling is controversial legally and musically. Experimental musicians who pioneered the technique in the 1940s to the 1960s sometimes did not inform or receive permission from the subjects of their field recordings or from copyright owners before constructing a musical piece out of these samples. In the 1970s, when hip hop was confined to local dance parties, it was unnecessary to obtain copyright clearance in order to sample recorded music at these parties. As the genre became a recorded form centred around rapping in the 1980s and subsequently went mainstream, it became necessary to pay to obtain legal clearance for samples, which was difficult for all but the most successful DJs, producers and rappers. As a result, a number of recording artists ran into legal trouble for uncredited samples, while the restrictiveness of current US copyright laws and their global impact on creativity also came under increased scrutiny.
Aside from legal issues, sampling has been both championed and criticized. Hip-hop DJs today take different approaches to sampling, with some critical of its obvious use. Some critics, particularly those with a rockist outlook, have expressed the belief all sampling is lacking in creativity, while others say sampling has been innovative and revolutionary. Those whose own work has been sampled have also voiced a wide variety of opinions about the practice, both for and against sampling.

The 2009 Kansas Jayhawks football team (variously "Kansas", "KU", or the "Jayhawks") represented the University of Kansas for the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision intercollegiate football season of 2009-2010 which was the school's 120th season. After beginning the season with five victories, the team lost their next seven games to finish the season with a 5–7 overall record (1–7 in the Big 12 Conference). It was the worst overall record since 2004 (when the Jayhawks won just four games) and the worst conference record since their winless 2002 season (in which they could only win two non-conference games).
The poor finish to the season marked the end of an era as head coach Mark Mangino, in his eighth year, resigned under pressure from both an internal investigation into his treatment of players and discontent from the season's results.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120309aaa.html|title=Mangino Resigns As Kansas Head Football Coach| accessdate= 4 December 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091207061245/http://www.kuathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120309aaa.html| archivedate= 7 December 2009| deadurl= no[/tpl] It was Ed Warinner's third season as offensive coordinator (and fifth year overall).

[[Neofit Bozveli]]
CATEGORIES: 1785 births, 1848 deaths, Bulgarian educators, Bulgarian writers, Bulgarian religious leaders, 19th-century Bulgarian people, People from Kotel

Neofit Bozveli ([tpl]lang-bg|Неофит Бозвели[/tpl]) (c. 1785 – 4 June 1848) was a Bulgarian cleric and enlightener and one of the leaders of the Bulgarian Church struggle.
Born in the lively sub-Balkan town of Kotel, Bozveli completed his basic education there and may well have been a student of Sophronius of Vratsa. He continued his education afterwards, then joined the Hilandar monastery on Mount Athos as a monk around 1803-1805. Towards 1813-1814 he settled in Svishtov, where he worked as an Eastern Orthodox priest and a teacher and began his enlightening activity by writing the Slavenobolgarskoe Detevodstvo pedagogical textbook in 1835. In this book, Bozveli spoke for secular education, for the enforcement of spoken Bulgarian in the schools and for the establishment of public Bulgarian schools.
Around 1834-1835, Bozveli lived in the Principality of Serbia in order to print his textbook. In Serbia, he got acquainted with the ideas of earlier Serbian enlighteners such as Dositej Obradović and Zaharije Orfelin. As he returned to Bulgaria, he actively promoted the idea of an independent Bulgarian Orthodox Church. He moved to the Ottoman capital Constantinople in 1839 to head the struggle of the Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen against the Greek-dominated Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The construction of the Bulgarian church in Constantinople and the establishment of the Bulgarian municipality in the city began on his initiative.
However, his patriotic acts were perceived as dangerous by the Patriarchate and he was exiled on Mount Athos in 1841 only to escape and return in 1844, where he continued the struggle together with his active and younger supporter Ilarion Makariopolski. In 1845, they were granted the rights to represent the Constantinople Bulgarians before the Ottoman government and the Patriarchate. In the same year, they sent two petitions to the Ottoman government, explaining the Bulgarian church demands. This caused the strong protest of the Patriarchate and the both were exiled again on Mount Athos, where Bozveli spent his last years in the Hilandar monastery. The church struggle was continued by Makariopolski and brought to a successful end with the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate on 28 February 1870 by the firman of Sultan Abdülaziz.
As a writer, Bozveli was the author of several imaginary dialogues between the personalized Fatherland and various members of the Bulgarian society. His most notable work is Plach bedniya Mati Bolgariya ("Wail of the poor Mother Bulgaria") that dates to 1846.

[[Ethylene glycol poisoning]]
CATEGORIES: Toxic effects of substances chiefly nonmedicinal as to source

Ethylene glycol poisoning is caused by the ingestion of ethylene glycol (the primary ingredient in both automotive antifreeze and hydraulic brake fluid). Ethylene glycol should not be confused with propylene glycol, a common food additive. Ethylene glycol is a toxic, colorless, odorless, almost nonvolatile liquid with a sweet taste that is occasionally consumed by children and dogs due to its sweetness. Following ingestion the symptoms of poisoning follow a three step progression starting with intoxication and vomiting, before causing metabolic acidosis, cardiovascular dysfunction, and finally acute kidney failure. The major cause of toxicity is not the ethylene glycol itself but its metabolites. The major metabolites causing toxicity are glycolic acid and oxalic acid.
Medical diagnosis of poisoning is most reliably done by measurement of ethylene glycol in the blood. However, many hospitals do not have the facilities to perform this test and need to rely on abnormalities in the body’s biochemistry to diagnose poisoning. Diagnosis can also be aided by examining the urine for the presence of calcium oxalate crystals. Treatment consists of initially stabilizing the patient, followed by the use of antidotes. The antidotes used are either ethanol or fomepizole (Antizol). The antidotes work by blocking the enzyme responsible for metabolizing ethylene glycol and therefore halt the progression of poisoning. Hemodialysis is also used to help remove ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. As long as medical treatment is undertaken, the prognosis is generally good with most patients making a full recovery. Poisoning is relatively common, and due to its taste, children and animals will sometimes consume large quantities of ethylene glycol. Denatonium benzoate, a bitterant, is added to many antifreeze products to discourage accidental or deliberate ingestion.

In 1951, archeologist Osman Habibulla began excavations in the settlement. The stratigraphy and cultural strata were clarified. The tell was much disturbed in the past.
As excavators had found, the town features a cultural layer with the total depth of 22 m. The earliest 9 m of this belongs to the Copper Age. On top of that are the remains of the Bronze Age, and then the Early Iron Age.
At each of these layers were found pottery dishes, cattle-breeding and agricultural implements, adornments, weapons etc.
In the Eneolithic layer were discovered remains of constructions, as well as burial places. Constructions were round as well as rectangular-shaped, and were made of mudbrick. Diameter of round constructions is ca 6–8 m. The rectangular ones are about 15 sq. m in size. These structures were typically connected with agriculture.
85 burial places were investigated in the Eneolithic layer. In 31 of those where found out pottery dishes, items made of bones and stone, and beads.
The Soviet scientists decided that Kultepe is the place, where firstly in the South Caucasus items made of copper-arsenic alloys which are dated back to the 4th millennium BC, were found out.Всеобщая история химии. М.: Наука, 1980, 399

[[Sundowning]]

CATEGORIES: Alzheimer's disease, Circadian rhythm, Sleep disorders, Psychiatric diagnosis

Sundowning is a psychological phenomenon associated with increased confusion and restlessness in patients with some form of dementia. Most commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, but also found in those with mixed dementia, the term "sundowning" was coined due to the timing of the patient's confusion. For patients with sundowning syndrome, a multitude of behavioral problems begin to occur in the evening or while the sun is setting.Smith, G. (2011, April 28). Alzheimer. Retrieved from Alzheimer's Association, "Sleeplessness and Sundowning." alz.org, 2011. Web. 14 May 2012.de Jonghe, A, J. C Korevaar, B. C Van Munster, S. E de Rooij. "Effectiveness of melatonin treatment on circadian rhythm disturbances in dementia. Are there implications for delirium? A systematic review." International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 25.12 (2010): 1201-08. Print. Sundowning seems to occur more frequently during the middle stages of Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia. Patients are generally able to understand that this behavioral pattern is abnormal. Sundowning seems to subside with the progression of a patient's dementia. Research shows that 20–45% of Alzheimer's patients will experience some sort of sundowning confusion.

[[Italian Empire]]
CATEGORIES: History of modern European colonialism, Italian Empire, Italian fascism, Overseas empires

The Italian Empire (Italian: Impero Italiano) was created after the Kingdom of Italy joined other European powers in establishing colonies overseas during the "Scramble for Africa". Modern Italy, as a unified state, had only existed from 1861. By this time, France, Spain, Portugal, Britain and the Netherlands had been carving out large empires for several hundred years. One of the last remaining areas open to colonisation was on the African continent.
By the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Italy had annexed Eritrea, Somalia, Libya and the Dodecanese Islands; it was also one of the European concession holders in Tientsin. Italy was defeated in its first attempt to conquer Ethiopia in the First Italo-Ethiopian War of 1895–1896 with Ethiopia receiving modern weapons and support from Russia and France, but succeeded in occupying it in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War of 1935–1936.Robert G. Patman. The Soviet Union in the Horn of Africa: The Diplomacy of Intervention and Disengagement. Cambridge University Press, 2009. During World War I, the Italian army captured Albania, which was declared an Italian protectorate in 1917,Nigel Thomas. Armies in the Balkans 1914–18. Osprey Publishing, 2001. Pp. 17. and, by the end of hostilities in November 1918, had captured the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the Treaty of London.Paul O'Brien. Mussolini in the First World War: the Journalist, the Soldier, the Fascist. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Berg, 2005. Pp. 17. The Entente Allies forced Italy to concede much of its captured territory in Dalmatia to the new state of Yugoslavia, with Italy only keeping the city of Zadar (Zara); in 1920, they also pressured Italy to remove its army from Albania.
The Fascist government under Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, which came to power in 1922, sought to increase the size of the empire further. In the late 1930s, Mussolini intended to increase Italy's power and influence by seeking to break up the Anglo-French alliance by being more conciliatory and cooperative with Britain, while being aggressive towards France.Reynolds Mathewson Salerno. Vital Crossroads: Mediterranean Origins of the Second World War, 1935–1940. Cornell University, 2002. p 32. Italy sided with Germany during World War II and initially enjoyed successes. Italy occupied Albania, part of Greece, Croatia, Slovenia and part of Egypt, with German military assistance after faltering campaigns in Greece and North Africa.

Fundamental human rights are a source of many of the differences.

[tpl]About|the professional American basketball player|other uses|Albert White (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Albert White[/tpl]

Albert White (born [tpl]birth date|mf=yes|1977|06|13[/tpl]) is a professional American basketball player who last played for the London Lightning of the National Basketball League of Canada.  Before joining the Lightning, White had played in a variety of domestic and foreign basketball leagues.  In high school, he was one of the most highly decorated basketball players in the United States.  In college he achieved success after transferring from University of Michigan to University of Missouri, but his success did not lead him to the National Basketball Association (henceforth NBA).  Instead, he went to the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and has since played in various developmental and foreign basketball leagues as a professional.
In high school, he was a Street & Smith,  Parade, and McDonald's All-American and in college he became a first team All-Big 12 Conference player and CNN/Sports Illustrated Big 12 Player of the Year.  White was implicated in the University of Michigan basketball scandal, but was not named in the final indictments.  He transferred from Michigan to Missouri after his freshman year, which included the basketball scandal, for unrelated reasons.  He achieved several firsts for Missouri and led the team to their best season in the Big 12 era in 1998–1999.
He declared himself eligible for the 1999 NBA draft as a redshirt junior and went undrafted.  He was drafted in the 1999 CBA draft. He has had multiple stints in the CBA, United States Basketball League (USBL), International Basketball League (IBL) and various foreign leagues.  As a professional, he once was named to the All-CBA second team.  He was selected as an All-star or All-league player and been part of championship teams in several of the professional leagues he played in.

Anderson House is an historic building located in Danburg, Georgia, USA and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
The Greek Revival home probably incorporates an earlier structure built in the 1790s and may have been built by Dr. W.D. Quinn.  John Anderson built the home as it now stands. The columns were made in Savannah and the mirrors and cornices were made in England.  Fine furniture and imported curtains came from New York and Chicago.  The 24x35 foot banquet room and the old stone kitchen were located in a separate building connected to the main home by a breezeway. 
The last Anderson to live in the home was Miss Pink Anderson.  This was during the Great Depression and there was no money to maintain the home.  The formal gardens and fountain were long gone and vines and undergrowth had taken over.  The home set empty for many years until it was purchased in 1962 by Ernest Walker who painted and remodeled the home.  The roof of the old kitchen and dining room had fallen in, with only the 16-18 walls standing, and was demolished.  Richard Simms, who bought the home in 1972,added a welcoming porch in the back.  They also added a picket fence where an original black iron fence had once been. The home is currently owned by Vinnie and Roderick Dowling.  The front porch with its columns faced the formal gardens, fountains, and holly trees.  It also had a greenhouse, brick walkways, and a gazebo.
A relative of Ernest Walker stated that when Walker purchased the Anderson House there were two slave cabins still intact directly behind the main house and that the cabins had sleeping lofts and were very spartan inside. They were made of pine. A canning shed was located directly west of the house, built in the style of the main house and somewhat ornate in decoration.In the attic of the main house there were old trunks filled with "day ledgers" from the store that served the community and the plantation dating to the late 1800s. Also in the attic were old dress-maker's forms and an assortment of old clothes.
The home is related to the Willis-Sale-Stennett House (1857) and the Chennault House (completed 1858)..Legends surround old homes named to national register Augusta Chronicle-Herald September 5, 1976 page 4F Sunday Chronicle-Herald by Vinnie Williams

[[Nigerian Observer]]

CATEGORIES: Newspapers published in Nigeria, Benin City, Publications established in 1968, English-language newspapers, 1968 establishments in Nigeria

The Nigerian Observer is a daily newspaper published in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. It has been published since 29 May 1968."Contact Us", Nigerian Observer website.] Retrieved on 19 August 2008.
The publisher, Bendel Newspapers Company Limited, is owned by the Edo State Government.[ref]
</ref>
In 1973, a correspondent for the Nigerian Observer wrote an article about an impending teacher's strike in Rivers State, which was published on the Governor Alfred Diete-Spiff's birthday. Taking this as a deliberate insult, Diete-Spiff's aide Ralph Iwowari had the reporter's head publicly shaved and had him beaten with 24 lashes of a cane.[ref]
</ref>
At that time the Nigerian Observer was owned by Bendel State, the predecessor of Edo State.
The Rivers State newspaper the Nigerian Tide did not mention the conflict with the teachers.[ref]
</ref> 
During the administration of President Shehu Shagari (1979-83) the newspaper was subject to harassment by the police, with staff being detained and the premises shut, as were other papers belonging to state governments controlled by opposition parties.[ref]
</ref>
Early in 1989 worsening economic conditions forced the paper to close for some time.[ref]
</ref>
On 22 July 1993 the administration of General Ibrahim Babangida banned the Nigerian Observer, as well as the National Concord, The Punch and the Daily Sketch.[ref]
</ref>
An analysis of the Nigerian Observer and other Nigerian papers published in 1999 noted that it had a relatively small circulation, with only 15% of column inches taken up by advertisements, compared to 50% in a typical North American paper. Many of the ads were government bulletins; low revenue coupled with shortage of newsprint had the effect of limiting coverage of events, and in particular of limiting investigative reporting.[ref]

[[Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme]]
CATEGORIES: Pensions in the United Kingdom

A Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme, or QROPS, is an overseas pension scheme that meets certain requirements set by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). A QROPS can receive the transfer of UK Pension Benefits without incurring an unauthorised payment and scheme sanction charge. The QROPS program was launched on 6 April 2006 as a part of new legislation with the objective of simplifying pensions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qrops.net/what-is-qrops/|title=What is QROPS|publisher=QROPS.net|accessdate=29 April 2012[/tpl]
Typically this occurs when a UK resident leaves the UK to emigrate permanently (or to retire abroad) having built up a pension fund within a scheme approved by HMRC or when a person born abroad who has built up benefits in a HMRC approved UK Pension Scheme decides to return to their home country with an expectation of retiring there. The QROPS does not have to be established in the new country of residence, thus providing greater flexibility and stability, along with choice of scheme provider.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iexpats.com/qrops/|title=QROPS – Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes|last=Smith|first=Lisa|publisher=iExpats.com|accessdate=6 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expatpensions.info/qrops|title=Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (QROPS)|publisher=Expat Pensions|accessdate=29 April 2012[/tpl]
HMRC states that:RPSM14101030 - Technical Pages: Transfers: Recognised transfers from registered pension schemes: Overseas pension scheme
 
 Under section 150(8) a recognised overseas pension scheme is an overseas pension scheme that meets the following requirements prescribed under The Pension Schemes (Categories of Country and Requirements for Overseas Pension Schemes and Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/206). It must:
Pension rule 1 in section 165 provides that no payment of pension may be made before the day on which the member reaches normal minimum pension age, unless the ill-health condition was met immediately before the member became entitled to a pension under the scheme.

To become a QROPS, a pension scheme must apply to and be approved by HMRC.  A list of QROPS that have consented to have their names published is available on the HMRC website and is regularly updated.Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (QROPS) List
In April and May 2012 HMRC introduced a new host of regulations that had the effect of shifting the jurisdictions in which QROPS could be established.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.international-adviser.com/news/retirement/guernsey-unveils-strategy-to-revive-qrops|title=Guernsey Unveils Strategy to Revive QROPS|publisher=International-advisor.com[/tpl] Guernsey had previously been the premier jurisdiction for QROPS but due to a conflict in between local legislation and HMRC regulations over 300 schemes were de-listed, but rather than close them permanently this had the effect of migrating the schemes to Malta.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prycewarner.com/news-guernsey-qrops-migrate-to-malta-242.html|title=Guernsey QROPS MIgrate to Malta|publisher=Pryce Warner International Group[/tpl] Since the new regulations came into force QROPS were also closed in Cyprus[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prycewarner.com/news-cyprus-qrops-removed-by-hmrc-261.html|title=Cyprus QROPS removed by HMRC|publisher=Pryce Warner International Group[/tpl] and are now principally available in Malta,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.international-adviser.com/news/retirement/malta-publishes-tax-guidelines-for-burgeoning|title=Malta publishes tax guidelines for burgeoning qrops industry|publisher=international-advisor.com[/tpl] the Isle of Man,[tpl]cite web|url=http://citywire.co.uk/new-model-adviser/skandia-looks-to-malta-and-isle-of-man-for-new-qrops-offering/a597057|title=Skandia looks to Malta and Isle of Man for new QROPS offering|publisher=Citywire[/tpl] and Gibraltar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prycewarner.com/news-gibraltar-introduce-qrops-241.html|title=Gibraltar to Introduce QROPS|publisher=Pryce Warner International Group[/tpl]
A QROPS should operate broadly in line with UK pension rules. A UK pension holder who has transferred their pension to a QROPS should be in a similar position as they would have been if the transfer had not taken place. What differentiates a QROPS from a UK held pension is that it must be recognised as a pension scheme under the country's legislation where it resides[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberty-wealth.com/news/qualified-recognised-overseas-pension-scheme-qrops-defined-991.html|title=QROPS Definition|publisher=Liberty Wealth[/tpl] whilst still complying with the rules set out by HMRC. As the jurisdiction's rules, where the pension resides, differ to UK rules this leads to benefits available to the holder in comparison to a UK pension scheme. These benefits include having a greater choice of how much income can be drawn and the ability to avoid death taxes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberty-wealth.com/services/pension-transfers/qrops-pension|title=QROPS pension transfers|publisher=Liberty Wealth[/tpl] On returning to the UK a QROPS will be treated the same as any other UK pension scheme which may necessitate changes to the underlying holdings. A key requirement prior to returning to the UK is to ensure all investments held within the account are UK compliant. This may involve selling some or all of the current investment holdings. The policy can then be fully endorsed.
QROPS schemes are required to report to HMRC any payments made to the member for at least ten years from the date that the transfer took place. However if the pension holder has been non-UK resident for five complete tax years they can benefit from more attractive options than those allowed under UK pension schemes.
QROPS are increasingly popular under British Expats due to the tax advantages on the pension draw downs and death benefits. Pension funds left in the UK are heavily taxed, in some cases up to 55%. Transferring a UK pension fund into a QROPS can avoid UK taxation.

Michael Webb (born 3 March 1937) is an English architect. He was a founding member of the 1960s Archigram Group, a collection of six young architects who were determined to shake up what they saw as a stodgy British architectural profession. Using a magazine format, Archigram promoted a radical rethinking of the concept of architecture, using inflatable structures, clothing-like environments, bright colors and cartoon-like drawing techniques that followed contemporary graphic and technological trends.
Webb was born in Henley-on-Thames and studied architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London, taking seventeen years to complete a five-year curriculum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archweb.cooper.edu/faculty/faculty/webb.html|date=2008-11-05|work=Faculty|title=Michael Webb|publisher=Cooper Union School of Architecture[/tpl] Webb moved to the United States in 1965 to teach at Virginia Tech, and has since taught architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design, Columbia University, Barnard College, Cooper Union, University at Buffalo and Princeton University.
He has also put on many exhibitions in Europe and America. His latest exhibition, Two Journeys, opened in the spending the fall semester learning about them through conversations and their drawings. The Two Journeys exhibition gave Webb an opportunity for the students to learn about him and his work. The exhibit was mounted and read like the pages of a book. It centered around two main themes: a train of thought deriving from the Reyner Banham article A Home is not a House (1965) and a study of linear perspective projection.

James H. Britton (July 11, 1817 – January 27, 1900) was the twenty-third mayor of St. Louis, Missouri.
Britton was born in Shenandoah County, Virginia on July 11, 1817.  In 1840, Britton moved to Troy, Missouri where he opened a general store.  He first became involved in Missouri politics when he became Secretary of the Senate of the Missouri Legislature in 1848.  Between 1852 and 1856, he served as a representative of Lincoln County in the State Legislature.  Afterwards, he took the position of Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of Representatives.  He would later serve as the Treasurer of Lincoln County and Postmaster of Troy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://exhibits.slpl.org/mayors/data/dt49584725.asp |title=St. Louis Mayors: James H. Britton |publisher=St. Louis Public Library |accessdate=2008-08-22[/tpl]
Britton moved to St. Louis in 1857 and took a job as a cashier at Southern Bank and, seven years later, became the bank's president.  A few years later, Britton was named president of the National Bank of the State of Missouri.
Following mayor Arthur Barret's sudden death in 1875, Britton ran for mayor and was nominated by the Democratic party on May 10, 1875.  In the special mayoral election held five days later on May 15, Britton defeated his opponent Henry Overstolz.  However, two days later, Overstolz decided to contest the election alleging ballot stuffing amongst other things.[tpl]cite news |url=http://newspapers.umsystem.edu/default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?BaseHRef=CLD/1875/11/05&EntityId=Ar00300&Skin=Google&ViewMode=GIF |title=The Mayorality |date=1875-11-05 |publisher=St. Louis Globe-Democrat |accessdate=2008-08-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Several months later, the ballots were recounted and on February 9, 1876, Britton was unseated and Overstolz was declared mayor.  Britton had lost by 77 votes out of more than 29,000 votes cast.
During the nine months that Britton served as mayor, many sewer districts were created and building inspections were mandated for new construction.
Britton died January 27, 1900 in Ardsley, New York and is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=19118644 |title=James H. Britton (1817–1900) |publisher=Find A Grave |accessdate=2008-08-22[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Defunct organizations, Human migration, Non-profit organizations based in Canada, Outplacement, Brain drain

The Technical Service Council was set up to combat the "brain drain" of Canadian engineers to the United States, when over 20% of the graduating classes were emigrating.  Ireland, India, New Zealand and even Switzerland have had similar problems.
In 1927, Canadian industry financed the Council, whose directors concluded that a non-profit employment service that was free to graduates might minimize emigration.  The service survived the Depression, played a part in recruiting scientists and engineers for war work, pioneered outplacement and expanded to include other professional occupations.  It financed major studies of the supply of and demand for engineers and offered free-job-hunting courses to professionals.
Although started in Toronto, the Council eventually had offices in Montreal, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver before becoming bankrupt in 1994.  It may have reduced the brain drain during its first 20 or 25 years, but it's not possible to judge its later record.

The 10 cm Gebirgshaubitze M 8 was a mountain howitzer used by Austria-Hungary during World War I. It was the first Austrian howitzer to use a modern hydraulic variable-recoil system. It used the same ammunition as the earlier 10 cm Gebirgshaubitze M 99, which was shown to be accurate, but lacked sufficient power to destroy bunkers, during World War I. It had a gun shield. It could be mounted on a special sled carriage designated 10 ''cm'' M. 8 Gebirgsschleife designed to allow for high-angle fire between +43° and 70° elevation. This sled was transported on a special bedding cart with removable wheels. The wheels were removed when in position to fire.
The 10 cm Gebirgshaubitze M 10 was virtually identical except that it had its traversing and elevating handwheels on different sides and it was not given a high-angle mount.

"Wouldn't I Be Someone" is a song by The Bee Gees. It was released on July 1973.  Although the single failed to chart in United States, it was a No. 1 hit in Hong Kong and in Costa Rica, and reached No. 17 in Italy.  Originally released on Best of Bee Gees, Volume 2 with an extended version timed at 5:31, it was noted for its lush symphony orchestra arrangement and bluesy guitar solo by Alan Kendall.  The single was shortened to a running time of 3:30 with the B-side of "Elisa". Both songs had been from an album called A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants. However, producer Robert Stigwood and Polydor refused to release that, citing it to not be commercial enough for sales.  It was followed by the more R&B flavored, "Mr. Natural", produced by legendary Arif Mardin.
The album, A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants, was released as a bootleg in Malaysia on Polydor, but this single and two B-side was RSO/Polydor label.

Henry C. Overstolz (July 4, 1821[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]November 29, 1887) was the twenty-fourth mayor of St. Louis, Missouri, serving from 1876 to 1881.
Overstolz was born in Munster, Germany[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] and moved to St. Louis in 1846, where he entered the merchandising business.  He quickly involved himself in the city's government and, in 1847, was elected to membership in the City Council.  In 1853, Overstolz was elected as the city's comptroller, becoming the first native-born German to be elected to office in St. Louis. Overstolz is a direct descendant of the oldest patrician family of Cologne, Germany.History of Saint Louis City and County: From the Earliest Periods ..., Volume 1 Later, in 1871, he was elected president of the city council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://stlcin.missouri.org/history/peopledetail.cfm?Master_ID=973 |title=St. Louis Historic Preservation: Overstolz, Henry Clemens |publisher=City of St. Louis |accessdate=2008-06-30[/tpl]

Overstolz was a supporter of the Charter and Scheme that separated the city of St. Louis from St. Louis County in 1876.  As a result of the new city charter, Overstolz became the first mayor of St. Louis elected to a four-year term when he was reelected in 1877.
During the course of his mayorship, Overstolz worked to reorganize the city government and forge new relationships with the county and state resulting from the changes instituted by the new city charter.
Overstolz sought a third term as mayor, but was defeated by William Ewing in the 1881 mayoral election.[tpl]cite web |url=http://stlcin.missouri.org/history/peopledetail.cfm?Master_ID=974 |title=St. Louis Historic Preservation: Ewing, William L. |publisher=City of St. Louis |accessdate=2008-06-30[/tpl]

[[Fan art]]

CATEGORIES: Art genres, Unofficial adaptations, Fan labor

Fan art or fanart are artworks created by fans of a work of fiction (generally visual media such as comics, movies, television shows or video games) and derived from a character or other aspect of that work. As fan labor, fan art refers to artworks that are neither created nor (normally) commissioned or endorsed by the creators of the work from which the fan art derives. 
A different, older meaning of the term is used in science fiction fandom, where fan art traditionally describes original (rather than derivative) artwork related to science fiction or fantasy, created by fan artists, and appearing in low- or non-paying publications such as semiprozines or fanziness, and in the art shows of science fiction conventions. The Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist has been given each year since 1967 for artists who create such works. Like the term fan fiction (although to a lesser extent), this traditional meaning is now sometimes confused with the more recent usage described above.

A screenshot, screen capture (or screen-cap), screen dump, screengrab Motive.co.nz is an image taken by the computer user to record the visible items displayed on the monitor, television, or another visual output device. Usually, this is a digital image using the operating system or software running on the computer, but it can also be a capture made by a camerahttp://archive.org/stream/run-magazine-33/Run_Issue_33_1986_Sep#page/n41/mode/2up or a device intercepting the video output of the display.  
Screenshots can be used to demonstrate a program, a particular problem a user might be having, or generally when display output needs to be shown to others or archived.  For example, after being emailed a screenshot, a Web page author might be surprised to see how their page looks on a different Web browser and can take corrective action. Likewise with differing email software programs, (particularly such as in a cell phone, tablet, etc.,) a sender might have no idea how their email looks to others until they see a screenshot from another computer and can (hopefully) tweak their settings appropriately.

Wise began playing fiddle at age 15, working locally in the Jacksonville area. He joined the Jubilee Hillbillies in 1938, then began playing with Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys in 1942, including dates at the Grand Ole Opry. He worked with Monroe through 1948, then played with Clyde Moody in 1948-49. He also played with the York Brothers, Flatt & Scruggs, and Connie B. Gay.
In 1954, Wise became a member of Hank Snow's Rainbow Ranch Boys, again appearing at the Grand Ole Opry; he remained with the group until 1970. Alongside this he worked as a session musician with Mac Wiseman and Red Allen, among others.
Wise returned to Florida in 1984 and went into semi-retirement, though he continued to tour and record occasionally, such as with the Bass Mountain Boys in 1992.
He joined producers Randall Franks and Alan Autry for the In the Heat of the Night (TV Series) cast CD “Christmas Time’s A Comin’” performing "Christmas Time's A Comin'" with the cast on the CD released on Sonlite and MGM/UA for one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.

[[Honda Rafaga]]

CATEGORIES: Honda vehicles, Slanted engines, Compact cars, Front-wheel-drive vehicles

The Honda Rafaga series CE4 and CE5 was a compact 4 door sedan sold only in Japan by Honda, introduced October 29, 1993, and used the same 5 cylinder engine that was used in the Honda Inspire and the Honda Vigor and shared a platform with the second generation CE series Honda Ascot. "Rafaga" is Spanish for "gust" or "blustery". The engine is installed longitudinally, the same configuration used in the Vigor and Inspire. The Rafaga was third in Hondas hierarchy of sedans, and a sister car to the Ascot, which was sold at the Honda Primo dealership network. The Rafaga was sold in Japan at Honda Verno dealerships, and was one level up from the Honda Integra. As with other Honda products, the Rafaga used double wishbone suspension at the front and rear wheels. The "2.5 S" trim level came with a front suspension upper strut brace in the engine compartment. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used premium grade fuel.
The Rafaga and the Ascot were introduced to serve as Honda's compact sedan for the Japanese market when the Accord's dimensions grew as a result of demand for the Accord in North America needing a wider car. The wheelbase of the Rafaga was shorter than the slightly longer Inspire and Vigor, which measured at [tpl]convert|2805|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl], a difference of [tpl]convert|35|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl], which didn't leave much room for rear seat passengers. Furthermore, due to the lengthwise installation of the five-cylinder engine, and the requirement that the overall length of the car comply with Japanese government regulations concerning cars classified as "compact", compromises were made with regards to rear passenger accommodations, and sales suffered as a result.
The grille is in the shape of an inverted triangle that flowed into the front bumper, and a small Honda "H" logo at the top. The Rafaga also had a long and low front engine compartment due to the placement of the engine, and a short trunk, adding to its aerodynamic ambitions. Under Japanese Government exterior dimension regulations, the Rafaga was a compact sedan, thereby supplanting the previous Honda Accord, which grew in exterior dimensions slightly. This approach thereby redirected compact sedan buyers to Honda Verno and Honda Primo locations.
The interior came with genuine wood panels provided by Japanese furniture maker Tendo Mokko on the dashboard and center console, with leather available as an option on the "2.5 S". In 1994, dual airbags for front passengers and ABS were available, as well as a glass moonroof.
As the recession began to take hold in Japan, known as the "bubble economy", and demand for the Accord remained strong, the Rafaga and the Ascot were discontinued and replaced with the Honda Torneo in 1997.

[[Kneeling position]]

CATEGORIES: Shooting positions

The kneeling position is a position for rifle shooting. There are no longer international competitions in pure kneeling shooting, but it is included as the last part of 300 metre rifle three positions, 300 metre standard rifle and 50 metre rifle three positions.
It takes a very long time to achieve a high level of performance in the kneeling position, this is partly due to the lack of training done in the position because of it requiring a lot of extra equipment (kneeling roll, additional sling and another set of sights etc.) The position is very uncomfortable when beginning until the shooter has gotten used to it, the main discomfort comes from the right foot which is effectively wedged in between the kneeling roll and the shooter.
In the United Kingdom there is also the problem with the number of ranges being certified to allow three positions shooting. To gain certification ranges must have additional protection on the range, for example additional protection (wood to slow the bullet) around metal lighting surrounds, placed in front of the firing line, in case of a stray bullet ricocheting off and returning up the range towards the firing line.

[[300 metre rifle three positions]]

CATEGORIES: ISSF shooting events, Rifle shooting sports

300 metre rifle three positions is an ISSF shooting event, involving shooting 40 shots each from the prone, the standing and the kneeling positions. Lately a similar event has been designed for women, where only half the course is shot. Originally there had been champions declared in each position based on the results of the 40 shots in the three position match. A special 300 metre rifle prone match was added in 1982 however, after a pattern from the so-called English Match. After 1990, no World Championship medals have been awarded in the standing or kneeling position.
300 metre rifle has been a declining event for many decades because of the considerable cost for competing in the event and the difficulty of creating ranges for it. The Olympic status was dropped in the 1970s, making 50 metre rifle the only rifle event on the program (10 metre air rifle was later added). 300 metre Rifle is still on the World and regional championships program, though.

Jerome David Salinger ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|ɪ|n|dʒ|ər[/tpl]; January 1, 1919[tpl]spnd[/tpl] January 27, 2010) was an American writer who won acclaim early in life.  He led a very private life for more than a half-century. He published his final original work in 1965 and gave his last interview in 1980.
Salinger was raised in Manhattan and began writing short stories while in secondary school. Several were published in Story magazine"J. D. Salinger". EXPLORING Novels. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Web. Nov 9, 2010. in the early 1940s before he began serving in World War II. In 1948, his critically acclaimed story "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" appeared in The New Yorker magazine, which became home to much of his later work. In 1951, his novel The Catcher in the Rye was an immediate popular success. His depiction of adolescent alienation and loss of innocence in the protagonist Holden Caulfield was influential, especially among adolescent readers.[tpl]Cite news|last=Skow |first=John |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938775,00.html |title=Sonny: An Introduction |publisher=Time |date=September 15, 1961 |accessdate=2007-04-12[/tpl] The novel remains widely read and controversial,[tpl]efn|See Beidler's A Reader's Companion to J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye.[/tpl] selling around 250,000 copies a year.
The success of The Catcher in the Rye led to public attention and scrutiny. Salinger became reclusive, publishing new work less frequently. He followed Catcher with a short story collection, Nine Stories (1953); a volume containing a novella and a short story, Franny and Zooey (1961); and a volume containing two novellas, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction (1963). His last published work, a novella entitled "Hapworth 16, 1924", appeared in The New Yorker on June 19, 1965.
Afterward, Salinger struggled with unwanted attention, including a legal battle in the 1980s with biographer Ian Hamilton and the release in the late 1990s of memoirs written by two people close to him: Joyce Maynard, an ex-lover; and Margaret Salinger, his daughter. In 1996, a small publisher announced a deal with Salinger to publish "Hapworth 16, 1924" in book form, but amid the ensuing publicity the release was indefinitely delayed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/65210/ |date=April 4, 2010 |title=Betraying Salinger |publisher=New York Magazine |accessdate=2010-04-16[/tpl] He made headlines around the globe in June 2009 when he filed a lawsuit against another writer for copyright infringement resulting from that writer's use of one of the characters from The Catcher in the Rye.Gross D.

Jeffrey "Jeff" Koons (born January 21, 1955) is an American artist known for his reproductions of banal objects—such as balloon animals produced in stainless steel with mirror finish surfaces. He lives and works in both New York City and his hometown of York, Pennsylvania.

Francisco de Quiñónez (? - ? Leon †); Spanish soldier who was appointed as governor of Chile for thirteen months, between May 1599 and June 1600.  
When he became governor of Chile, Quiñónez was a veteran soldier. He had served, in 1559, in the Spanish Tercios that operated in Italy. He embarked in the squadron of the viceroy of Naples, in a campaign against Turkish pirates. In 1560 in the Battle of Djerba that was a disaster for the Spaniards who lost thirty ships.  Quiñónez became one of the five thousand prisoners who were taken to Istambul and sold as slaves.  Later rescued by means of the payment of a large ransom, he continued as a soldier fighting in Italy and Flanders.  On his return to Spain, Quiñónez married Grimanesa de Mogrovejo, sister of the inquisidor of Granada, later canonized as Saint Turibius of Mongrovejo.  When this monk was promoted to the rank of archbishop of Lima, Quiñónez went to Peru, in 1580, as part of his retinue. Thanks to the protection of the archbishop, Quiñónez soon became Maestro de Campo and general commissioner of the cavalry. In 1582, the Viceroy of Peru, Martin Enríquez de Almansa made him commander of the treasure fleet that sailed from Peru to Panama, be sent to Spain from there. Later he was named corregidor of Lima, a position in which he gained some notice as a pursuer of thieves and vagabonds. 
Quiñónez was designated Royal Governor of Chile by the Viceroy of Peru, Luis de Velasco, after finding out about the death of Martín García Óñez de Loyola at the hands of the forces of the Mapuche toqui Pelantaro, in the Battle of Curalaba. Once in Chile he replaced the lawyer Pedro de Viscarra, who had temporarily administered the government. He commanded the Spaniards during the early desperate months of the Mapuche Revolt of 1598. During 1599, despite his efforts the Mapuche destroyed the forts of Chivicura and Jesus de Huenuraquí in Catirai and its city Santa Cruz de Coya, the cities of Santa María la Blanca de Valdivia, San Andrés de Los Infantes and San Bartolomé de Chillán y Gamboa.  In 1600, Quiñónez was able to rebuild a fort at the site of the destroyed city of Chillán.

Collage (From the [tpl]lang-fr| coller[/tpl], to glue, [tpl]IPA-fr|kɔ.laːʒ[/tpl]) is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the visual arts, where the artwork is made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.
A collage may sometimes include magazine and newspaper clippings, ribbons, paint, bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, photographs and other found objects, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an art form of novelty.
The term collage derives from the French "coller".[tpl]cite web |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcollagedenise.com%2Fpage2.html&date=2012-04-12 |url=http://collagedenise.com/page2.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |title=Origin of the term "collage" |first=Denise |last=Enslen[/tpl] This term was coined by both Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of modern art.Collage, essay by Clement Greenberg Retrieved July 20, 2010

50 metre running target mixed is an ISSF shooting event, shot with a .22-calibre rifle at a target depicting a boar moving sideways across a 10 metre wide opening. A part of the ISSF World Shooting Championships since 1970, it differs from 50 metre running target in that the slow runs (target visible for 5 seconds) and the fast runs (target visible for 2.5 seconds) are randomized so the shooter does not know in advance which speed to expect.

CATEGORIES: 6th-century Romans, Rhetoricians

Emporius was a Latin rhetorician and the author of three short tracts titled De Ethopoeia ac Loco Communi Liber, Demonstrativae Maleteriae praeceptum and De Deliberatia Specie. He is believed to have flourished not earlier than the sixth century, chiefly from the circumstance that he refers in his illustrations to the regal power rather than to the imperial dignity, which he would scarcely have done had he lived before the revival of the kingly title.
Emporius was first edited by Beatus Rhenanus, along with some other authors upon rhetoric.Basil. 4to. 1521 (cited by Ramsay) The pieces named above will all be found in the Antiqui Rhetores Latini of Francois Pithou.4to., Paris, 1599, p. 278. (cited by Ramsay)

[[10 metre running target mixed]]

CATEGORIES: ISSF shooting events, Rifle shooting sports

10 metre running target mixed is one of the ISSF shooting events, in which one shoots an airgun at a target that moves sideways. The target is pulled across a two meter aisle at a range of 10 metres from the firing point. The target is pulled either slow or fast, and it is visible for 5 or 2.5 seconds, respectively. The difference from 10 metre running target is that the slow and the fast runs are fired in a randomized order, that is not known beforehand to the shooter.
The course of fire is 40 shots, divided into two 20-shot stages, each consisting of exactly 10 slow and 10 fast runs.

The introduction of the Torneo continued the original approach Honda used in 1982 with the introduction of the Honda Vigor in offering a unique variant of the Accord for each of the three dealership Honda sales channels with the sportier Torneo utilizing a different front grille, headlights and tail lights, and exclusive trim packages and color choices.
With the release of the seventh-generation Accord in 2002, the Torneo nameplate was discontinued. However, the seventh-generation Accord assimilated much of the sportier character of the Torneo, making it effectively the successor of the Torneo as well as the previous generation Accord.

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology

Enalus or Enalos  was a man from Lesbos in ancient Greek mythology.
The Penthelides, the first settlers in Lesbos, had received an oracle from Amphitrite commanding them to sacrifice a bull to Poseidon and a virgin to Amphitrite and the Nereides, as soon as they should, on their journey to Lesbos, come to the rock Mesogeion. The leaders of the colonists accordingly caused their daughters to draw lots, the result of which was, that the daughter of Smintheus or Phineus was to be sacrificed. 
When she was on the point of being thrown into the sea, her lover, Enalus, embraced her, and leaped with her into the deep. But both were saved by dolphins. Once the sea all around Lesbos rose in such high billows, that no one ventured to approach it; Enalus alone had the courage to do so, and when he returned from the sea, he was followed by polypi, the greatest of which was carrying a stone, which Enalus took from it, and dedicated in a temple.Plut Sept.

CATEGORIES: Georgetown University student organizations, Student newspapers published in Washington, D.C.

The Georgetown Voice is the student-run weekly campus newsmagazine at Georgetown University. It has a circulation of approximately 4,000 and prints an edition every Thursday. 
The Voice was founded in March 1969 in the context of the Vietnam War, when a group of senior editors at The Hoya, Georgetown University's main campus news source, left in order to comment on topics off as well as on campus. The debut editorial, published March 4, 1969, explained the organization’s goals and purposes:
 “Our editorial policy will view and analyze issues in a liberal light. We shall not limit our editorial content to campus topics. We promise to present and analyze national and local issues of concern to the student, whose concern should spread beyond the campus … We shall attempt with all our energy to inform the community, to make the community conscious of controversial subjects by an open presentation and discussion of relevant issues, to communicate a culture, and to entertain our readers.”Vox Populi: About 
The Voice consists of Editorial, News, Sports, Feature, Leisure (arts & entertainment), Page 13 (the content of which is largely left to its editor's discretion), and Voices (non-fiction submitted by the campus community). While The Voice is explicitly liberal in its editorial content, its news reporting is objective. It is primarily known for its in-depth pieces featured on the cover, as well as its Leisure section that focuses on less well-known film, art, theatre, music and food in the District of Columbia. In 2006, The Voice also founded a blog, Vox Populi, the popularity of which soared in recent years.
On April 11, 2007, The Voice was quoted on the Senate Floor as Democratic Senator Robert Menendez from New Jersey got into a lengthy argument with President Bush’s Special Envoy to Sudan Andrew Natsios over whether the classification of genocide still holds in Darfur.Sudane Tribune. Transcript: US Natsios, Senator Menendez clash over Darfur. April 16, 2007
Although Georgetown does not have a Journalism Major, alumni from The Voice have worked in the field with CNN, CBS, Agence France-Presse, The Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, The Atlantic, the Washington City Paper, PopMatters, Entertainment Weekly, the Poynter Center, The Nation, Slate, The New Yorker, and The Washington Post.

A decompiler is a computer program that performs the reverse operation to that of a compiler.  That is, it translates program code at a relatively low level of abstraction (usually designed to be computer readable rather than human readable) into a form having a higher level of abstraction (usually designed to be human readable). Decompilers usually do not perfectly reconstruct the original source code, and can vary widely in the intelligibility of their outputs. Nonetheless, decompilers remain an important tool in software reverse engineering.

[[Enantiophanes]]

CATEGORIES: Byzantine jurists

Enantiophanes was a Byzantine jurist whose exact identity is uncertain.John Thomas Graves, writing in 1870, states the following: Cujacius, in his Preface to the 60th book of the Basilica, prefixed to the 7th volume of Fabrot's edition of that work, supposes Enantiophanes to be the assumed name of a Graeco-Roman jurist, who wrote peri enantiophanôn, or concerning the explanation of apparent legal inconsistencies. Suarez (Notit. Basil. § 35) says that Photius, in his Nomocanon, mentions having written such a work. Fabricius, in a note upon the work of Suarez (which is inserted in the Bibliotheca Graeca,) states that Balsamo, in his Preface to the Nomocanon of Photius, refers to Enantiophanes. Assemanni, however, shows (Bibl. Jur. Orient. ii. 18, p. 389) that there is no reason for attributing a work peri enantiophanôn to Photius, that there is no passage in his Nomocanon relating to such a work, and that the sentence in which Balsamo is supposed by Fabricius to refer to Enantiophanes has no such meaning. The Ennantiophanôn biblion is cited in Basil. v. p. 726. Enantiophanes (Basil. vi. p. 250) cites his own book de Legatis et Mortis Causa Donationibus, and the Paragraphê, or annotation, of Enantiophanes is cited in Basil. vii. p. 496. The period when the jurist lived who bears this name has also been a subject of much dispute among scholars.Graves relates what follows:  Reiz (ad Theophilum, pp. 1234, 1236) thinks that Enantiophanes wrote before the composition of the Basilica, and marks his name with an asterisk as an ascertained contemporary of Justinian. In Basil. iii. p. 318 Enantiophanes calls Stephanus his master; but this is by no means conclusive. Assemanni, misled by Papadopoli, thinks that the Stephanus here meant lived under Alexius Comnenus, and was not the Stephanus who was one of the compilers of Justinian's Digest. The contemporary of Justinian, however, was undoubtedly the person intended; but Stephans was one of those early Graeco-Roman jurists who, like Domninus, Patricius[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl], and Cyrillus, are thought by Zachariae[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] (Anecdota, p. viii.) to have been called by subsequent jurists masters or teachers in a general sense. (Compare Basil. 11. tit. i. s. 67, sch. ed. Heimbach, i. p. 646.) Zachariae places Enantiophanes among the jurists who lived before the time of Basileius Macedo (Hist. Jur. Gr. Rom. Deiius, § 20. 1, 2.) That he lived before the formation of the present text of the Basilica, appears from his being several times named in the text itself, as in iii. p. 258, where he cites Theophilus ; ii. p. 560, where he cites the Code of Justinian ; i. 99, where lie cites the Novells of Justinian. According to the Scholium on the Basilica (ii. p. 548, ed. Heimbach), he seems to have written notes upon the Digest. That he was alive after the death of Justinian appears from Basil. iii. p. 230 (ed. Heimbach), where he cites a Novell ot Justin. On the other hand, Assemanni thinks that he wrote after the composition of the Basilica, which, in the Scholium, Basil. i. p. 262, he appears to cite; but it is very likely that here, as in many other places, that which was originally a citation from the Digest has been subsequently changed for convenience into a reference to the Basilica. In Basil. iii. p. 440, he cites Gregorius Doxapater, whom Pohl (followed by Zachariae), on the supposed authority of Montfaucon, places in the first half of the 12th century; but we have shown that there is no ground for identifying Gregorius Doxapater with the Doxapater mentioned by Montfaucon. An eminent jurist of the time of Justinian is frequently cited in the Basilica, and in the Scholia on that work by the appellation of the Anonymous. This writer composed an Index or abridgment of the Novells of Justinian, and was the author of Paratitla (a comparison of parallel passages) in the Digest. To this work the treatise on apparently discordant passages would form a natural sequel; and Mortrenil (Histoire du Droil Byzantin, i. p. 296) makes it probable that Enantiophanes and the Anonymous were the same persons; for in Basil. vi. p. 251 Schol., a passage is ascribed to Enantiophanes, which, in Basil. vi. p. 260, Schol., is attributed to the Anonymous. Biener (Geschichte der Novellen Justinians, p. 56) threw out the conjecture, that the Anonymous was no other than Julianus, the author of the Latin Epitome of the Novells; and Zachariae (Anecdota, p. 204-7) attempts to establish this conjecture. Mortreuil seems disposed to identify the three. In order to facilitate investigation, we subjoin a list (formed from Reiz and Fabricius) of passages in the Basilica where the name of Enantiophanes occurs: Basil. i. pp. 70, 99, 100, 109, 260, 408, 262, 265, 266, ii. pp. 540, 560, 609, 610, 628, iii. pp. 43, 170, 258, 318, 393, 394, 412, v. p. 726, vi. 250, 251, 260, vii. 496, 499, 565, 640, 641.

[[Tablature]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

Tablature (or tabulature, or tab for short) is a form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.
Tablature is common for fretted stringed instruments such as the lute, vihuela, or guitar, as well as many free reed aerophones such as the harmonica.  Tablature was common during the Renaissance and Baroque eras, and is commonly used in notating rock, pop, folk, ragtime, bluegrass, and blues music.
Three types of organ tablature were used in Europe: German, Spanish and Italian.  There are several types of ocarina tabulature.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindocarina.com/enjoy/fingering.shtml |title=ocarina tabulature |publisher=Hindocarina.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl]
To distinguish standard musical notation from tablature, the former is usually called "staff notation" or just "notation".
An alternate usage of the word "tab" is common on the Internet, where it can also refer to conventional chord symbols (for harmony), or note names (for melody).

The Yablanski House ([tpl]lang-bg|къща на Яблански[/tpl], kashta na Yablanski) is a Neo-Baroque house in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, situated at 18 Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard in the city centre and regarded as one of the highest achievements of the city's architecture in the first decade of the 20th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sofia.bg/history.asp?lines=1813&nxt=1&update=all |title=Софийската елитна къща (1878-1920) |accessdate=2008-08-20 |language=Bulgarian |publisher=Столична община[/tpl] Although the building was proclaimed a monument of culture in 1955,[tpl]cite news |url=http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2006-09-22&article=161391 |title=Пожари разчистват бизнеса на Кирчеви |language=Bulgarian |publisher=Стандарт |date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2008-08-20 [/tpl] as of 2008 it is uninhabited and in a bad condition due to mismanagement.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.netinfo.bg/?tid=40&oid=1135825 |title=Тревога за къщата на Яблански на "Царя" |language=Bulgarian |publisher=Нетинфо |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2008-08-20 [/tpl]
The Yablanski House was built in 1906-1907 to the designs of Austro-Hungarian architect Friedrich Grünanger (1856–1929) on the order of the wealthy financier and former mayor of Sofia Dimitar Yablanski (1859–1924).[tpl]cite book |last=Кираджиев |first=Светлин |title=София 125 години столица 1879-2004 летопис |year=2006 |publisher=ИК Гутенберг |location=София |language=Bulgarian |id=ISBN 954-617-011-9 |page=78 [/tpl] The exterior decoration was the work of the royal decorator of the Bulgarian Royal Family, Andreas Greis. Architecturally, the house was designed in the Baroque style with some Renaissance elements, with the interior stucco done in the Rococo style. The mansard floor is an important feature of the house's artistic design, together with the balcony railings of wrought iron and the several female sculptures. The furniture and the materials were specially supplied from Vienna.[tpl]cite book |title=Енциклопедия на изобразителните изкуства в България, том 1 |publisher=Издателство на БАН |location=София |year=1980 |language=Bulgarian [/tpl] The house's architecture draws heavily from an earlier work of Grünanger's, the Royal Palace in Sofia. Notably, the architect's home in Salzburg, where he later moved and subsequently died, is almost identical to the Yablanski House.
After the Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944 and the establishment of a Communist government, the house was nationalized and used as the embassy of the People's Republic of China until 1991. After 1991, it was given back to the heirs of Yablanski who proceeded to sell it to First Private Bank. In 1996, the bank went bankrupt and the Yablanski House changed numerous owners. In the early 2000s, it was owned by Draft EOOD, who intended to build at 46-metre building at its place, a project halted by the Capital Municipal Council.
In 2006, the Yablanski House was included in the list of collapsing buildings;[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.temanews.com/index.php?p=tema&iid=215&aid=5389 |title=Хипотетично или ипотетично |last=Ценова |first=Искра |language=Bulgarian |publisher=ТЕМА |accessdate=2008-08-20 [/tpl] despite the efforts of the Capital Municipal Council, its owners have not undertaken its restoration. As of June 2009, the house is being reconstructed and is to be made into a restaurant.

Software that allows these rights is called free software and if the software is copyleft ensures those are retained. The GPL demands both. The license was originally written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU project.
In other words, the GPL grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software DefinitionGPL FAQ: Does using the GPL for a program make it GNU Software? and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved whenever the work is distributed, even when the work is changed or added to. The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derived works can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are the standard examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.
[tpl]As of|2007|08[/tpl], the GPL accounted for nearly 65% of the 43,442 free software projects listed on Freecode,[tpl]cite web |url=http://Freecode.com/stats/ |title=Freecode's statistics page[/tpl] and [tpl]As of|2006|alt=as of January 2006[/tpl], about 68% of the projects listed on SourceForge.net.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/frozen/sourceforge-stats-20031110.html |title=SourceForge.net: Software Map |publisher=Dwheeler.com |accessdate=17 November 2008[/tpl] Similarly, a 2001 survey of Red Hat Linux 7.1 found that 50% of the source code was licensed under the GPL[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/redhat62-v1/redhat62sloc.html |title=Estimating Linux's Size |author=David A.

Some other free software programs (MySQL is a prominent example) are dual-licensed under multiple licenses, often with one of the licenses being the GPL.
David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.
On 29 June 2007, the third version of the license (GNU GPLv3) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version (GNU GPLv2) that were discovered during its long-time usage. To keep the license up to date the GPL license includes an optional "any later version" clause, allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF. Developers can omit it when licensing their software; for instance the Linux kernel is licensed under GPLv2 without the "any later version" clause.[tpl]cite web|url=http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/tree/COPYING|quote=Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated. |accessdate=2013-08-13 |publisher=kernel.org |first=Linus |last=Torvalds|title=COPYING[/tpl]

William Hubbs Rehnquist (October 1, 1924 – September 3, 2005) was an American lawyer, jurist, and political figure who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and later as the 16th Chief Justice of the United States. Considered a conservative, Rehnquist favored a conception of federalism that emphasized the Tenth Amendment's reservation of powers to the states. Under this view of federalism, the Supreme Court of the United States, for the first time since the 1930s, struck down an Act of Congress as exceeding its power under the Commerce Clause.
Rehnquist served as Chief Justice for nearly 19 years, making him the fourth-longest-serving Chief Justice after John Marshall, Roger Taney, and Melville Fuller, and the longest-serving Chief Justice who had previously served as an Associate Justice. The last 11 years of Rehnquist's term as Chief Justice (1994–2005) marked the second-longest tenure of a single unchanging roster of the Supreme Court, exceeded only between February 1812 and September 1823. He is the eighth longest-serving justice in Supreme Court history.

In production and development, open source as a development model promotes a universal access via free license to a product's design or blueprint, and b) universal redistribution of that design or blueprint, including subsequent improvements to it by anyone.Lakhani, K.

Organization Science. doi: 10.1287/orsc.2013.0872 http://doi.org/rfb Before the phrase open source became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of other terms. Open source gained hold with the rise of the Internet, and the attendant need for massive retooling of the computing source code.[tpl]harvnb|Weber|2004[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] Opening the source code enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models, communication paths, and interactive communities.
The open-source software movement arose to clarify the environment that the new copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues created.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Generally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design. Open-source code is typically created as a collaborative effort in which programmers improve upon the code and share the changes within the community. Open source sprouted in the technological community as a response to proprietary software owned by corporations.
The open-source model includes the concept of concurrent yet different agendas and differing approaches in production, in contrast with more centralized models of development such as those typically used in commercial software companies.Raymond, Eric S.

[[Pas Yisroel]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew words and phrases, Kosher food, Ten Days of Repentance

Pas Yisroel or Pat Yisrael ([tpl]lang-he|פת ישראל[/tpl] lit:"Bread of an Israelite,") products are grain-products that were cooked or baked with the participation of an observant Jew.  The observant Jew must, at minimum, ignite the flame used to prepare, cook, or bake the grain product.  In classical Rabbinic Judaism, this requirement is considered restricted to the five classical grains of Judaism - wheat, barley, oats, spelt, and rye.  In the modern food-production industry, commercial bakeries may accomplish a status of Pas Yisroel by the use of something called the "Shain system", (named for the inventor, Rabbi Yehuda Shain) whereby an entire apparatus can be ignited remotely by an observant Jew.
It is customary that extra care is taken to uphold this observance during the first ten days of the month of Tishrei, between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur.
The qualification for one to be considered an "observant" Jew – and therefore able to uphold the observance of Pas Yisroel – is defined as one who is Shomer Shabbat. This is regardless of affiliation. An example of this encompassing multiple denominations is a hypothetical scenario of a Reform Jew who is a baker, and an Orthodox Jew who wants to buy the baked goods produced by the baker; if the baker is:
then the grain-product could still receive a distinction of Pas Yisroel by the Orthodox Jew's preferred Hekhsher.

[[List of governors of Portuguese India]]
CATEGORIES: Portuguese India, Lists of office-holders, Viceroys of Portuguese India, Governors-General of Portuguese India, Lists of Portuguese colonial governors and administrators

The government of Portuguese India started in 1505, six years after the discovery of the sea route to India by Vasco da Gama, with the nomination of the first Viceroy Francisco de Almeida, then settled at Kochi. Until 1752, the name "India" included all Portuguese possessions in the Indian Ocean, from southern Africa to Southeast Asia, governed - either by a Viceroy or Governor - from its headquarters, established in Goa since 1510. In 1752 Portuguese Mozambique got its own government and in 1844 the Portuguese Government of India stopped administering the territory of Portuguese Macau, Solor and Portuguese Timor, being then confined to  Malabar.
The following is a list of rulers during the history of Portuguese India as a viceroyalty or governorship.List based on: Danvers, Frederick Charles (1988) The Portuguese in India: being a history of the rise and decline of their eastern empire. Asian Educational Services; p. 487 (Appendix B); and  Henry Morse Stephens (1892) Albuquerque, Oxford: Clarendon Press, Vol. 4,p.13
(*) - In 1508, King Manuel I of Portugal devised a plan to partition the Portuguese empire in Asia into three separate governments or "high captaincies" - (1) Capitão-Mor dos mares da Ethiopia, Arabia e Persia, centered at Socotra, was to cover the East African and Arabian-Persian coasts, from Sofala to Diu; (2) Capitão-Mor dos mares da India, centered at Cochin, was to cover the Indian coast from Diu down to Cape Comorin.  Afonso de Albuquerque was Captain-General of the latter. Jorge de Aguiar was made Captain-General of the former.  A third high captaincy, covering Asia east of Cape Comorin (yet to be explored) was assigned to Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, who was assigned that year to discover Malacca.  The triarchy experiment failed - Aguiar drowned en route, while Sequeira quit the region in 1509, after his debacle at Malacca, leaving Albuquerque sole governor of the whole unpartitioned complex.
(**) - Around 1570, King Sebastian of Portugal tried to partition the Portuguese State of India into three separate governments (much like Manuel's plan of 1508) - a western state based around Sofala (covering the East African coast from Cape Correntes to Cape Guardafui), a central state ruled from Goa (covering the area between the Red Sea and Ceylon, encompassing India, reserved for the "Viceroy") and an eastern state ruled from Malacca (covering Southeast Asia, from Pegu to China).  D. António de Noronha was appointed to Goa, António Moniz Barreto to Malacca, and Francisco Barreto (the former India governor) to Sofala.
(***) - Title of Viceroy of Indies extinguished by royal letter in 1771, replaced by Capitão-Geral (Captain-General) of the Indies.

Michael "Mickey" Hamill (19 January 1889 – 23 July 1943) was an Irish association football wing half who played professionally in Ireland, Scotland, England and the United States.
A native of West Belfast, he learned to play Gaelic football before turning to association football. His first clubs were St Paul's Swifts and Belfast Rangers. After signing for Belfast Celtic, he made his debut against Shelbourne in 1909, but only became a first-team regular at inside-right from 1910 onwards. A skilful performance in a friendly against Celtic F.C. led to Manchester United signing him for a new record fee of £175 on New Year's Eve 1910.
His career at Manchester United was blighted by irregular appearances in the first team. A disagreement over a benefit match led to Hamill returning to Belfast Celtic on a free transfer. The fact that Manchester United received no indemnity for the loss of Hamill's services led to an agreement being established between the Football League and the Irish League regarding the transfer of players between the two leagues.
In 1914, Hamill led Ireland to their first Home Championship win. This included a victory over England at Ayresome Park, Middlebrough, which was considered by many to be Hamill's greatest-ever game. However he would be capped by Ireland on just seven occasions; he later refused to play for Ireland until alleged discrimination against Catholic players by the Irish Football Association ceased.
Hamill won his first Irish Cup medal with Belfast Celtic in 1918, playing through a knee injury to lead his team to victory over Linfield.
During World War I, Hamill had played in Scotland for a season with Celtic, winning a League and Charity Cup medal. In 1920, after Belfast Celtic temporarily withdrew from competitive football, he returned to Manchester, this time to play for Manchester City.
Hamill later returned to Belfast Celtic but left again in 1925, just after having married. His destination was Fall River, Massachusetts, where he would play for the Fall River Marksmen. He played only two 1924–1925 pre-season exhibition games with the Marksmen. In the first, he performed masterfully in 3–2 victory over the Boston Soccer Club. His second trial game was a fiasco and the team released him after the match. He then immediately signed with Wonder Workers.The Magic of Mickey He spent two seasons in Boston before moving to the New York Giants at the start of the 1926–1927 season. He played only one game before returning to Ireland.[tpl]cite book | last = Jose | first = Colin | title = American Soccer League, 1921–1931 | type = Hardback | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | year = 1998 | id = (ISBN 0-8108-3429-4) [/tpl]
When Hamill returned to Ireland, he signed yet again for Belfast Celtic where he ended his playing career after the 1929–1930 season. He would later manage Belfast club Distillery and run the 'Centre-Half Bar' on Belfast's Falls Road.
His drowned body was recovered from the River Lagan at Lisburn on 23 July 1943.

[[Minister of Everything]]
CATEGORIES: Political terminology

A Minister of Everything, sometimes also called Minister for Everything, refers to a Minister who wields great and wide-reaching power in the government, usually as the head of a powerful and influential ministry (often a "super ministry" combining two or more portfolios), but also can influence government machinery outside his direct control. The title is unofficial, and often assigned by the media or other political figures. Ministers who are seen as holding the title are often regarded as the second most powerful person in the government after the head of government, and often (but not always) this position is cemented by holding the official title of Deputy Prime Minister/Deputy Premier/Deputy First Minister etc. The term can also be used as a criticism of heads of government who take a more hands on approach in governing and give ministers less independence,http://www.stuff.co.nz/4202425a6220.html or a head of government who hold additional powerful cabinet portfolios.

[[National Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council]]

CATEGORIES: Off-roading

The National Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council (NOHVCC) is a publicly supported, education foundation organized for the sole purpose of developing and providing a wide spectrum of programs, materials and information, or “tools”, to individuals, clubs, associations and agencies in order to further a positive future for responsible OHV recreation.

File:Nohvcc2.jpg|Trail riding ATVs is a huge sport in the U.S. Click on this photo for a larger version.
File:Nohvcc3.jpg|Off-Highway motorcycle riding first became popular in the early '70s.
File:Nohvcc4.jpg|Jeep and 4x4 enthusiasts enjoy challenging terrain. 
File:Nohvcc5.jpg|Aimed primarily at young riders, the NOHVCC Adventure Trail program stresses safe and responsible riding practices.

The primary purpose of the National Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council is to help off-highway riders (ATVs, dirt bikes and 4x4s) keep their riding areas open, and create new ones, by giving them the tools to organize, gather funds, work with local politicians, land owners, and land managers, and other ways to keep the sport happy and healthy. Rider education (promoting safe and responsible riding practices) is also a very important part of their mission since they believe that responsible riders are the best way to keep riding areas open. The organization also hosts detailed workshops and an annual conference for professional OHV (Off-Highway Vehicle) land managers and agencies.
The reason the NOHVCC was formed in 1991 was to gather the nation’s most influential OHV activists and pick their brains for what works and what doesn’t in their battle to keep riding areas open, as well as starting new ones.
Every year they gather in one place to meet with all the NOHVCC State Partners as well as many other important OHV organizers and land managers to share and record information. This info eventually becomes the basis for the ‘tools’ they utilize in their literature and consulting services. Their intensive organizational and management workshops that are held at various locations throughout the country dispense important information to OHV activists and federal and state land managers.
The NOHVCC is a non-profit organization that doesn’t solicit memberships or money from the grassroots weekend riders.

CATEGORIES: 2003 songs, Beyoncé songs, Songs written by Beyoncé

"Daddy" is a song recorded by American recording artist Beyoncé for her debut studio album, Dangerously in Love (2003). It was composed by Knowles as well as Mark Batson. The song was not originally intended to be featured on the final track listing of the album. Knowles was able to record the song as the release date of her debut album had been postponed. "Daddy" was released to US iTunes Store as a digital single on June 3, 2003, through Columbia Records.
Knowles explained that the song's development was motivated by the devotion and the loyalty her father/manager, Mathew Knowles has towards his family members. Many of the songs on the album examine aspects of relationships. However, "Daddy" was considered to be an element analyzing the kinship ties between a father and his offspring from a different and more powerful perspective. Music critics, who generally received the song with positive reception, commented that the song was a way for Knowles to pay tribute to her father.

[[Endius]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Spartans, 5th-century BC Greek people

Endius (Endios) was a Spartan ephor during the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC).
Endius was a son of Alcibiades, member of a family whose connection with that of the Athenian Alcibiades had in a previous generation introduced into the latter this Lacedaemonian name. It is he apparently who was one of the three ambassadors sent by Sparta in 420 BC to dissuade Athens from the Argive alliance. They were chosen, says Thucydides, from the belief of their being acceptable to the Athenians, and possibly in particular with a view to conciliate his guest, Alcibiades, who probably made use of this very advantage in effecting the deception by which he defeated their purpose. 
He was elected ephor in the autumn of 413 BC, the time of the Athenian disaster at Syracuse. And through him Alcibiades now inflicted on his country the severe blow of bringing the Lacedaemonians to the coast of Ionia, which otherwise would at any rate have been postponed. His influence decided the government to lend its first succor to Chios; and when the blockade of their ships in Piraeus seemed likely to put a stop to all operations, he again persuaded Endius and his colleagues to make the attempt. Thucydides says that Alcibiades was his patrikos es ta malista xenos; so that probably it was with him that Alcibiades resided during his stay at Sparta.Thuc. v. 44, viii. 6, 12. (cited by Clough) 
To these facts we may venture to add from Diodorusxiii. 52, 53 (cited by Clough) the further statement, that after the defeat at Cyzicus in 410 BC, he was sent from Sparta at the head of an embassy to Athens with proposals for peace of the fairest character, which were, however, through the influence of the presumptuous demagogue Cleophon, rejected. Endius, as the friend of Alcibiades, the victor of Cyzicus, would naturally be selected; and the account of Diodorus, with the exception of course of the oration he writes for Endius, may, notwithstanding the silence of Xenophon, be received as true in the main.

The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a single-engine ground-attack aircraft that constitutes the second generation of the Harrier Jump Jet family. Capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. Named after a bird of prey,[tpl]Cite web|author=Searle, Adrian|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/28/tate-britain-fiona-banner1|title=Fiona Banner's toys for boys are a turn-on at Tate Britain|work=The Guardian|date=June 29, 2010|accessdate=October 21, 2013|archiveurl=http://archive.is/Pb0Vz|archivedate=October 20, 2013|quote=the Harrier is in any case named after a bird of prey.[/tpl] it is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B is used by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.
The project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered around a powerful revamped Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the United Kingdom abandoned the project in 1975.
Following the withdrawal of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra hardpoint per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.
Typically operated from small aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs have participated in numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of the seven most important weapons of the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage of time spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until at least 2030.

Alexandria (formerly Belhaven and Hunting Creek Warehouse)http://dls.state.va.us/lrc/charters/Alexandria.pdf is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 139,966,[tpl]cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51510.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014[/tpl] in 2013, the population was estimated to be 151,218.http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics. Virginia State 2013 Population Estimates Retrieved February 2, 2013 Located along the Western bank of the Potomac River, Alexandria is approximately six miles (9.6 kilometers) south of downtown Washington, D.C.
Like the rest of Northern Virginia, as well as central Maryland, modern Alexandria has been shaped by its proximity to the nation's capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, in the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the U.S. Department of Defense. Others include the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Center for Naval Analyses. In 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office moved to Alexandria.
The historic center of Alexandria is known as Old Town.  With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, antique shops and theaters, it is a major draw for tourists. Like Old Town, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact, walkable, high-income suburbs of Washington, D.C. It is the seventh largest and highest income independent city in Virginia.
A portion of adjacent Fairfax County, Virginia is named Alexandria, but is under the jurisdiction of Fairfax County and separate from the city; the city is sometimes referred to as the City of Alexandria or Alexandria City to avoid confusion. In 1920, Virginia's General Assembly voted to incorporate what had been Alexandria County as Arlington County, Virginia to minimize confusion.

[[Ammunition]]
CATEGORIES: Ammunition, Explosives, Weapons

Ammunition (colloquially shortened to ammo) is gunpowder and artillery, or broadly anything that can be used in combat including bombs, missiles, warheads, landmines, naval mines, and anti-personnel mines. The word comes from the French la munition which is all material used for war. The collective term for all types of ammunition is munitions.
The purpose of ammunition is to project force against a selected target. However, the nature of ammunition use also includes delivery or combat supporting munitions such as pyrotechnic or incendiary compounds. Since the design of the cartridge, the meaning has been transferred to the assembly of a projectile and its propellant in a single package.
Ammunition involves the application of fire to targets, general use of weapons by personnel, explosives and propellants, cartridge systems, high explosive projectiles (HE), warheads, shaped charge forms of attack on armour and aircraft, carrier projectiles, fuzes, mortar ammunition, small arms ammunition, grenades, mines, pyrotechnics, improved conventional munitions, and terminally guided munition.

[[Amnesty]]

CATEGORIES: Clemency, Criminal law

Amnesty (from the Greek ἀμνηστία amnestia (Amnesty, Wm Chrichton Μεγα Ελληνο-Αγγλικον Λεξικον 1960)   is defined as:
"A pardon extended by the government to a group or class of persons, usually for a political offense; the act of a sovereign power officially forgiving certain classes of persons who are subject to trial but have not yet been convicted."Bryan A. Gardner (ed.). 2009. Blacks Law Dictionary (9th ed.). St. Paul, MN: West, p99
It includes more than pardon, in as much as it obliterates all legal remembrance of the offense. Amnesty is more and more used to express 'freedom' and the time when prisoners can go free.
Amnesties, which in the United Kingdom may be granted by the crown or by an act of Parliament, were formerly usual on coronations and similar occasions, but are chiefly exercised towards associations of political criminals, and are sometimes granted absolutely, though more frequently there are certain specified exceptions. Thus, in the case of the earliest recorded amnesty, that of Thrasybulus at Athens, the thirty tyrants and a few others were expressly excluded from its operation; and the amnesty proclaimed on the restoration of Charles II of England did not extend to those who had taken part in the execution of his father. Other famous amnesties include: Napoleon's amnesty of March 13, 1815 from which thirteen eminent persons, including Talleyrand, were exempt; the Prussian amnesty of August 10, 1840; the general amnesty proclaimed by the emperor Franz Josef I of Austria in 1857; the general amnesty granted by President of the United States, Andrew Johnson, after the American Civil War (1861-April 9, 1865), in 1868, and the French amnesty of 1905.  Amnesty in U.S. politics in 1872 meant restoring the right to vote and hold office to ex-Confederates, which was achieved by act of Congress.Robert W. Burg, "Amnesty, Civil Rights, and the Meaning of Liberal Republicanism, 1862-1872". American Nineteenth Century History 2003 4(3): 29-60. Those were true amnesties, pardoning past violations without changing the laws violated.
The last act of amnesty passed in Great Britain was that of 1747, which pardoned those who had taken part in the 1745 Jacobite Rising.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on November 6, 1986 granted amnesty to about 3 million illegal immigrants in the United States.

[[Anti-communism]]
CATEGORIES: Anti-communism, Communism, Political movements

Anti-communism is opposition to communism. Organized anti-communism developed in reaction to the rise of communism, especially after the 1917 October Revolution in Russia and reaching global dimensions during the Cold War. In this sense anti-communism does not necessarily indicate aversion to the ideology of communism, but rather opposition to Marxist-Leninist one-party states, such as the former Soviet Union and its allies, which have been criticised as not being communist societies, but rather only in name: see state communism.
Most anti-communists reject the concept of historical materialism, which is a central idea in Marxism. Anti-communists reject the Marxist belief that capitalism will be followed by socialism and communism, just as feudalism was followed by capitalism. Anti-communists question the validity of the Marxist claim that the socialist state will "wither away" when it becomes unnecessary in a true communist society.
Anti-communists argue that the repression in the early years of Bolshevik rule, while not as extreme as that during Joseph Stalin's rule, was still severe by reasonable standards, citing examples such as Felix Dzerzhinsky's secret police, which eliminated numerous political opponents by extrajudicial executions, and the brutal crushing of the Kronstadt rebellion and Tambov rebellion. Some anti-communists refer to both Communism and fascism as totalitarianism, seeing similarity between the actions of communist and fascist governments. Historian Robert Conquest has argued that Communism was responsible for tens of millions of deaths during the 20th century.
Opponents[tpl]Who|date=July 2011[/tpl] argue that communist parties that have come to power have tended to be rigidly intolerant of political opposition. Communist governments have also been accused of creating a new ruling class (a Nomenklatura), with powers and privileges greater than those previously enjoyed by the upper classes in the non-communist regimes.
The label "anti-communist" has often been used by fascist and far-right parties, such as the Nazi Party, the National Fascist Party and the Falange party. Anti-communism is a key element of fascist ideology.

Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway 3759 is a standard gauge 4-8-4 (four leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels), Northern type, steam railway locomotive built by Baldwin in 1928. It is on display in Locomotive Park, located between Andy Devine Avenue and Beale Street in Kingman, Arizona. The park was established in August 1957 with AT&SF 3759 donated to the City of Kingman in recognition of Kingman's history with the railroad.
3759 was delivered in 1928 as a 3751 class 4-8-4 passenger locomotive.  Originally a coal burning locomotive with 73-inch drivers, the fleet was converted to oil in 1936 and rebuilt between 1938 and 1941 with 80-inch drivers. Its regular passenger run was from Los Angeles to Kansas City, with Kingman as a water stop on the way back to Los Angeles. Retired in 1953, the engine had traveled over 2,585,000 miles.
In February 1955, 3759 was brought out of retirement at the request of the Railway Club of Southern California for a special excursion run, dubbed "Farewell to Steam."  It ran on February 6, a round trip between Los Angeles Union Station and Barstow, California with stops in Pasadena and San Bernardino and was the last Santa Fe revenue steam train to leave Los Angeles and to traverse Cajon Pass.  After this trip, 3759 went back into storage, until Santa Fe donated the locomotive to the city of Kingman in 1957.
The locomotive was added to the National Register of Historic Places as AT&SF Locomotive in 1986, reference number 86001113. In 1987 caboose 999520 was retired and donated to Kingman to be added behind 3759.

Neues vom Tage (News of the Day) is a comic opera (lustige Oper) in three parts by Paul Hindemith, with a German libretto by Marcellus Schiffer.
The opera is a satire of modern life, celebrity and marriage, involving parodies of both Puccini's music and Berlin cabaret. The opera became notorious for a scene with a naked soprano (Laura) singing in the bath about the wonders of modern plumbing, though Hindemith replaced her with the tenor (Hermann)  in the revised version.
The mischievous nudity particularly aroused the ire of Ernst "Putzi" Hanfstängel, Hitler’s musical advisor, and was later cited by the Nazis as evidence that the "degenerate art" of the "cultural bolshevist" Hindemith should be excluded from Germany.Geissmar, Bertha: Two Worlds of Music, Creative Age Press, NY 1946.

[[Pistolerismo]]
CATEGORIES: History of anarchism, 20th century in Spain, History of Barcelona, Riots and civil disorder in Spain

Pistolerismo (from Spanish pistolero, gunman) refers to the practice, used by Spanish employers during Alfonso XIII’s reconstruction crisis, of hiring thugs to face syndicalists and notable workers. The workers replied in turn by hiring their own gunmen. 
In the end, pistolerismo caused the death of 200 workers and 20 employers’ gunmen.
Pistolerismo primarily affected Barcelona's urban and industrial proletariat, which was getting active and making an increasing number of strikes motivated by the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), a Spanish anarcho-syndicalist trade union, though there were similar actions in other Spanish cities. After experiencing the CNT’s great power in Labor disputes, the employers decided to strike back through violence, and the employer-worker clash degenerated into white pistolerismo (white terrorism by the employers), replied to in turn by anarcho-syndicalist terrorism. Employers, politicians, the clergy and the forces of order on the one hand, and syndicalist leaders and lawyers were the target of these two kinds of terrorism.
The employers replied by closing several factories, dooming a lot of workers to unemployment and famine. The employers were helped by  “Yellow” Trade Unions, or “Free” Trade Unions, such as the Sindicat Lliure, which provided scabs to supply the workers that were being punished. They also forced the Government to stop, by any means, the increasing role of anarcho-syndicalism in Spain. The Government chose General Martínez Anido as Civil Governor of Barcelona. He protected the white terrorism while putting down syndicalism by applying the “escaping law”, a process that consisted of telling prisoners that they had just being released, in order to execute them moments later for “attempting to escape from prison”. 
White gunmen assassinated, among many others, famous syndicalists such as Pau Sabater in 1919, Evelio Boal in 1921, Salvador Seguí “El Noi del Sucre”, Francesc Comes in 1923, and lawyers such as Francesc Layret in 1920.

[[Traveling wave reactor]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear power reactor types

A traveling-wave reactor (TWR) is a type of nuclear reactor that nuclear engineers anticipate can convert fertile material into usable fuel through nuclear transmutation in tandem with the burnup of fissile material. TWRs differ from other kinds of fast-neutron and breeder reactors in their ability to use fuel efficiently without uranium enrichment or reprocessing, instead directly using depleted uranium, natural uranium, thorium, spent fuel removed from light water reactors, or some combination of these materials.
The name refers to the fact that fission does not occur throughout the entire TWR core, but remains confined to a boundary zone that slowly advances through the core over time. TWRs could theoretically run, self-sustained, for decades without refueling or removing any spent fuel from the reactor.

Pre-Columbian Ecuador included numerous indigenous cultures, who thrived for thousands of years before the ascent of the Incan Empire. Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador is one of the oldest cultures in the Americas."Ecuador Indigenous Cultures." Exploring Ecuador. (retrieved 5 January 2011) The Valdivia culture in the Pacific coast region is a well-known early Ecuadorian culture. Ancient Valdivian artifacts from as early as 3500 BC have been found along the coast north of the Guayas Province in the modern city of Santa Elena.
Several other cultures, including the Quitus, Caras and Cañaris, emerged in other parts of Ecuador. There are other major archaeological sites in the coastal provinces of Manabí and Esmeraldas and in the middle Andean highland provinces of Tungurahua and Chimborazo. The archaeological evidence has established that Ecuador was inhabited for at least 4,500 years before the rise of the Inca.
Great tracts of Ecuador, including almost all of the Oriente (Amazon rainforest), remain unknown to archaeologists, a fact that adds credence to the possibility of early human habitation. Scholars have studied the Amazon region recently but the forest is so remote and dense that it takes years for research teams to survey even a small area. Their belief that the river basin had complex cultures is confirmed by the recent discovery of the Mayo-Chinchipe Cultural Complex in the Zamora-Chinchipe Province.Arqueología Ecuatoriana - Home and "Zamora-Chinchipe Archaeological Project"
The present Republic of Ecuador is at the heart of the region where a variety of civilizations developed for millennia. During the pre-Inca period people lived in clans, which formed great tribes, and some allied with each other to form powerful confederations, as the Confederation of Quito. But none of these confederations could resist the formidable momentum of the Tawantinsuyu. The invasion of the Inca in the 15th century was very painful and bloody. However, once occupied by the Quito hosts of Huayna Capac (1593–1595), the Incas developed an extensive administration and began the colonization of the region.
The pre-Columbian era can be divided up into four eras:

Molus River is a fresh water tributary of the Richibucto River, located in Weldford Parish, New Brunswick, Canada. At one time named Moulies River Station, it is located 3.15 km North East of Bass River, New Brunswick on the road to Richibucto. In 1904 Moulies River Station was a stop on the Kent Northern Railway. 
The first European settlers of the south side of the Molus River were 1821 Thomas Phelan (Whalen), John Phelan, Patrick Phelan. By the 1830s the north side was also opened and the Warman family settled here. Other settler names: Olsen, Dargavel, Stevenson, Millar, McPherson, Ward, and Harnett. The community reached its height in the late 19th century. By 1900 the community was in decline, the virgin forest of white pine and maple had been stripped from the land to supply the shipbuilding community down river at Kingston now Rexton. 
Land Grants at Provincial Archives New Brunswick indicate that in 1819 Molus River was "at the center of the Indian Reserve" when it was opened to British subjects for settlement. The community of Molus River, a farming and forestry community, now takes its name from the river. Elsipogtog First Nation is nearby.

Oxalis hedysaroides, known as the fire fern, is not a fern but a flowering perennial plant native to the Caribbean. It is a member of the woodsorrel genus (Oxalis) that grows to 30 cm height and 10 cm spread. 
The plant gets its common name from the fact that its leaves, while starting green, turn a deep purple red with exposure to sun. Oxalis hedysaroides is a very mobile plant and will rotate its foliage significantly to follow the sun. At dusk, the plant can seem to quiver slightly as the red leaves partially close by folding in half. 
The foliage of the fire fern is supported by branched wiry purple stems, and the plant produces small yellow flowers when in bloom.

Socialism or Barbarism is a book about globalism, U.S. socialism and capitalist systems by Hungarian Marxist philosopher and Professor Emeritus István Mészáros. It was published in 2001 and is composed of two parts, the first part is an expanded version of an essay of the same title originally published in 2000;OYTOPIA (no.39 March–April 2000) the second part consists of an interview conducted in 1998.Naghd (no. 25, Spring 1999)/ Science and Society, 63:3 (Fall 1999)
Mészáros' is convinced that the future of socialism will be decided in the U.S.A. and sees its main obstacle to be the globalization of Keynesian neo-liberalism.  He reckons that the 21st century will coincide with the third stage of capitalism which Mészáros characterizes as the barbarous global competition for domination between a plurality of free-market capitalist systems.Mészáros (2001, 81) His examination of the history of American capitalism predicts several eminent ramifications to this struggle: imperialist driven territorial expansion in the Middle East, the continuation and increase of NATO aggression,Mészáros (2001, 44) increased infrastructure weakening with major degradation in the quality of life for the lower class,Mészáros (2001, 42) and eventually a proxy war with China via U.S.A.'s defense treaties with Japan.
Much of the book is devoted to applying Marx's nineteenth century theories to current events, such as the environment:
 

What Mészáros prescribes is a labor union socialist solution, specifically the syndicalist form of socialism that Samuel Gompers had abandoned when the AFL provided the a workforce for the U.S. involvement in World War I. He advocates a marxist form of socialism:

[[Mudboy]]
CATEGORIES: Musicians from Rhode Island

 
mudboy (aka. Raphael Lyon) is an experimental musician and artist from Providence, Rhode Island.
mudboy began recording experimental noise and electronic organ music in 2000 while a resident of Fort Thunder and continues to do so today.  Over twenty albums have been released on a variety of labels since then. His compositions have been related to early minimalists such as Terry Riley, though he has identified dub music as an important influence in interviews.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.digitalisindustries.com/foxyd/features.php?which=262 |title= Feature Interview |accessdate=2008-08-20 |work= |publisher= Digitalis industries |year= 2008[/tpl]
As an installation artist, mudboy builds mysterious landscapes that hearken back to the ambient noise-filled landscapes which fill his music. A residency at the art and book store in Los Angeles "Family" produced "a large-scale, touch-sensitive, dark-activated, 3-dimensional, 6-oscillator spellcasting diorama and crystal cave. This installation is a meditation on the potential of fractal topography, fungal biota, and the productive necessity of decay."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.familylosangeles.com/blog/archive/2008_01_01_family_archive.html |title= Family Los Angelos Blog |accessdate=2008-08-20 |work= |publisher= |year= 2008[/tpl]  Other installations in Baltimore, Chicago, and Providence also use darkness, micro LED lights, kaleidoscopic mirrors, fog machines and organic cardboard creations to create illusions. He is represented by The Mountain Fold Gallery in New York City.
The following is an excerpt from his artist statement:
"My own intellectual affinity is with a time when the role of the artist, the priest and the doctor were not separated by contemporary conventions of specialization. Indeed, the operative metaphor for my work is derived from occult histories of magic and spellcasting, and from variations on the shamanic tradition. I lean heavily on the theoretical writings of authors like Ursula Le Guin and Philip K. Dick, both of whom argue that the production of "fantasy" and "miracle" is a critical, anti-fascist, and ultimately utopian occupation. It is wonder then, that I use my work to create"[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.mfoldgallery.com |title= Mountain Fold Gallery [/tpl]

The Naismith Trophy is a trophy awarded to the men's champion of the FIBA Basketball World Cup, and is named for basketball inventor James Naismith.  The trophy was first awarded for the winner of the 1967 FIBA World Championship.  The current version of the trophy was awarded for the first time at the 1998 FIBA World Championship.
As early as the first tournament in 1950, FIBA had decided to name the trophy in honor of Naismith, but did not have the funds to create the trophy.  Finally, in 1965, FIBA received a US $1,000 donation and commissioned a trophy.  The trophy was introduced at the 1967 tournament and was awarded to the Soviet Union, which won their first ever FIBA World Championship at the tournament.
The original trophy was remodeled and a new, updated trophy was introduced for the 1998 FIBA World Championship.  The original trophy now sits at the Pedro Ferrándiz Foundation in Spain.[tpl]cite web|url= http://egyptology.blogspot.com/2006/01/ancient-egypt-in-basketball.html |title=Ancient Egypt in basketball |publisher=egyptology.blogspot.com |date= 17 January 2006 |accessdate=8 September 2010[/tpl]  The new Naismith Trophy was forged by Goldsmith master Günter Schoebel who came from Bad Kreuznach, Germany.  The design of the trophy was inspired by the travels of long-time FIBA Secretary General Renato William Jones.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/event-guide/p/trophy.html |title=Naismith Trophy Unites Five Continents |publisher=FIBA.com |accessdate=7 September 2010[/tpl] The new trophy was presented to the World Champions from Yugoslavia for the first time following the Finals on 9 August 1998 in Athens.
The top part of the newly created Naismith Trophy has a lotus flower design.  The decagonal rotating middle piece, with carved maps of the continents and precious stones inlaid, symbolizes the five continents. Black onyx, yellow citrine, green chyrsopase, red garnet and blue topaz represent all the regions in the world.  Jones was particularly enamored with Egypt; the lotus design was inspired by the Temples of Karnak and Dr. Naismith's name is engraved on all four sides in Latin and Arabic scripts, Chinese characters, and Egyptian hieroglyphs.
The 975/1000 sterling silver on the upper and lower parts – gold plated on the inside – and the 14-carat yellow gold middle part make the cup particularly valuable and precious. The base is made of Rosa Porrhino marble and measures 20 x 20 centimeters (7.9 inches).  The top of the cup has a circumference of 21 centimeters (8.3 inches).  Standing 47 centimeters tall (18.5 inches), the trophy weighs a whopping nine kilograms (20 pounds).

Closely related to the tenso, a debate between two poets, and the partimen, a question posed by one poet and another's response, the torneyamen took place between several poets, originally usually three. The first three-way tenso was initiated by Raimbaut de Vaqueiras with Ademar de Peiteus and Perdigon.It—Senher n'Aymar, chauzes de tres baros—is available, with English translation, here. These wider tensos only became known as torneyamens later.Chambers, Frank M. (1985), An Introduction to Old Provençal Versification (Diane Publishing, ISBN 0-87169-167-1), p. 151–152. A tenso or partimen that was submitted to another troubadour for adjudication may have a poetic jutjamen (judgement) attached to it and so may be considered as a torneyamen between three. The torneyamen, like the related debate forms, was probably especially common at contests, such as floral games and puys. Many such tensos and partimens come with attached jutjamens rendered in verse, as in the example Senyer Bernatz, dues puncelhas say cited below.

[[Ansgarde of Burgundy]]
CATEGORIES: 826 births, 880s deaths, People from Burgundy (French region), Women of medieval France, Aquitainian queens consort

Ansgarde of Burgundy (826-880/882) was a French queen of Aquitaine, but never of West Francia, the daughter of Hardouin of Burgundy.  She secretly married Louis II of France before he was king; her sons became Louis III and Carloman II of France.
At the time of the marriage, Ansgarde was 36 years old; Louis was only 16.  Because Charles the Bald wished to marry his son to Adélaïde de Frioul, he had to seek a papal annulment; this he did, and Adélaïde married Louis in February 878.
Ansgarde was thus repudiated, but at the death of Louis II in 879 she worked to ensure that her sons could mount the throne of France themselves.  To that end, she sought to revisit the subject of her divorce with the archbishop of Reims.  Adélaïde, however, was pregnant, and gave birth to a son on September 17 of that year, which thus called into doubt the inheritance of Ansgarde's own sons.
Ansgarde and her sons attacked Adélaïde's marriage, accusing her of adultery; consequently, Louis and Carloman mounted the throne together.  However, both died without issue, and after a long and difficult process Adélaïde finally saw her son confirmed as Charles III, the only legitimate heir to the throne.
Ansgarde passes into obscurity after this episode, and the date of her death is not conclusively known.

[[Chase (algorithm)]]
CATEGORIES: Database theory, Database algorithms

The Chase is a simple fixpoint algorithm testing and enforcing implication of data dependencies in database systems. It plays important roles in database theory as well as in practice.
It is used, directly or indirectly, on an everyday basis by people who design databases, and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design.[tpl]cn|date=November 2012[/tpl] New applications of the chase in meta-data management and data exchange are still being discovered.
The Chase has its origins in two seminal papers, one by David Maier, Alberto O. Mendelzon, and Yehoshua Sagiv[ref]
David Maier, Alberto O. Mendelzon, and Yehoshua Sagiv: "Testing Implications of Data Dependencies". ACM Trans. Datab. Syst. 4(4):455-469, 1979.[/ref] and the other by
Alfred V. Aho, Catriel Beeri, and Jeffrey D. Ullman.Alfred V. Aho, Catriel Beeri, and Jeffrey D. Ullman: "The Theory of Joins in Relational Databases", ACM Trans. Datab. Syst. 4(3):297-314, 1979.
The chase can be done by drawing a tableau (which is the same formalism used in tableau query). Suppose R has attributes A, B, ... and components of t are a, b, .... For ti use the same letter as t in the components that are in Si but subscript the letter with i if the component is not in i. Then, ti will agree with t if it is in Si and will have a unique value otherwise.
The chase process is confluent.

[[History of education in Scotland]]
CATEGORIES: History of education in Scotland

The history of education in Scotland in its modern sense of organised and institutional learning, began in the Middle Ages, with the education of boys based around Church choir schools and grammar schools. By the end of the 15th century schools were also being organised for girls and universities were founded at St Andrews, Glasgow and  Aberdeen. Education was encouraged by the Education Act 1496, which made it compulsory for the sons of barons and freeholders of substance to attend the grammar schools, which in turn helped increase literacy among the upper classes. 
The Scottish Reformation resulted in major changes to the organisation and nature of education, with the loss of choir schools and the expansion of parish schools, along with the reform and expansion of the Universities. In the seventeenth century, legislation enforced the creation and funding of schools in every parish, often overseen by  presbyteries of the local kirk. The existence of this network of schools later led to the growth of the "democratic myth" that poor boys had been able to use this system of education to rise to the top of Scottish society. However, Scotland's University system did help to make it one of the major contributors to the Enlightenment in the 18th century, producing major figures such as David Hume and Adam Smith. 
Religious divisions and the impact of industrialisation, migration and immigration disrupted the existing educational system and in the late nineteenth century it was reorganised and expanded to produce a state-funded national system of free basic education and common examinations. The reform of Scottish universities made them major centres of learning and pioneers in the admission of women from 1892. In the 20th century Scottish secondary education expanded, particularly for girls, but the universities began to fall behind those in England and Europe in investment and expansion of numbers. The government of the education system became increasingly centred on Scotland, with the final move of the ministry of education to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution in 1999 the Scottish Executive also created an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department and there was significant divergence from practice in England, including the abolition of student tuition fees at Scottish universities.

[[Dependency theory (database theory)]]
CATEGORIES: Database theory, Database constraints

Dependency theory is a subfield of database theory which studies implication and optimization problems related to logical constraints, commonly called dependencies, on databases.
The best known class of such dependencies are functional dependencies, which form the foundation of keys on database relations. Another important class of dependencies are the multivalued dependencies. A key algorithm in dependency theory is the Chase, and much of the theory is devoted to its study.

Operation Clambake, also referred to by its Web address, Xenu.net, is a Web site and Norway-based non-profit organization, launched in 1996, founded by Andreas Heldal-Lund, that publishes criticism of the Church of Scientology. It is owned and maintained by Andreas Heldal-Lund, who has stated that he supports the rights of all people to practice Scientology or any religion.[tpl]cite web | last = Heldal-Lund | first = Andreas |   title = Operation Clambake FAQ: Why do you hate Scientology? | work = Operation Clambake | url = http://www.xenu.net/cb-faq.html#faq1 |   accessdate =  2007-10-22[/tpl] Operation Clambake has referred to the Church of Scientology as "a vicious and dangerous cult that masquerades as a religion".[tpl]cite news | last = Didcock | first = Barry |  title = "Hubbard love": Barry Didcock puts his scepticism aside and goes in search of the truth behind one of the world’s most controversial religions | work = Sunday Herald |    date = February 17, 2007 | url = http://www.sundayherald.com/life/people/display.var.1200747.0.hubbard_love.php | accessdate =  2007-10-22[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last = Marney | first = Holly |  title = Cult or cure? | work = Scotland on Sunday |    date = May 20, 2007 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/opinion.cfm?id=782292007 | accessdate =  2007-10-22[/tpl]  The Web site includes texts of petitions, news articles, exposés, and primary source documents.[ref]
</ref>  The site has been ranked as high as the second spot in [[Google]] searches for the term "Scientology".<ref name="googleaddssitesbysubtracting" />
The term for the organization refers both to a traditional clam bake, as well as the notion from L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology: A History of Man that humans follow a "genetic line" which includes clams, and that the psychological problems afflicting humans are impacted by past experiences.  The domain name Xenu.net is a reference to the character Xenu from secretive "OT III" Scientology documents.
In 1996, the site was one of the first locations on the internet to host secret Scientology documents pertaining to Xenu and OT III.  Shortly thereafter, the Church of Scientology attempted to get this material removed from Operation Clambake and other internet sites, through letters written by counsel, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  After receiving a DMCA takedown notice, Google removed many Xenu.net pages from its indexes, which decreased the site's page rank in searches for "Scientology".  This inspired Google to contribute to the Chilling Effects archive, informing others about material missing from Google indexes due to DMCA takedown notices and other legal threats.
Operation Clambake has been consulted by news media organizations and other groups for information on Scientology and related organizations.  Dateline NBC cited the organization in a 1998 investigative journalism piece, as have other publications including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Associated Press.  During the Spring 2002 semester, Xenu.net was included as required reading in a New York University course on "Copyright and Censorship",[tpl]cite news  | last = Hull | first = Nathan |  title = Copyright and Censorship | work = Computers in Principle and Practice |   publisher = New York University | date = April 2002 | url = http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring02/V22.0004-004/nytimes.html | accessdate = 2007-10-22[/tpl] and in 2003 webmaster Andreas Heldal-Lund received the 2003 Leipzig Human Rights Award  by the European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA, an organization opposed to the Church of Scientology.

"Oh, Pretty Woman" is a song, released in August 1964, which was a worldwide success for Roy Orbison. Recorded on the Monument Records label in Nashville, Tennessee, it was written by Roy Orbison and Bill Dees. The song spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.Bronson, Fred (2003). The Billboard Book of #1 Hits, 5th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 157. "Pretty Woman" was also Orbison's third single to top the UK Singles Chart chart (for a total of three weeks). The previous Orbison singles to reach No.1 in the UK were "Only the Lonely" in 1960 and "It's Over" earlier in 1964. There were three guitar players on the session,  Billy Sanford, Jerry Kennedy and Wayne Moss.  Billy Sanford,  who later played session for everybody from Elvis to Don Williams (and took to the road with Don in the 1990s) did the kick-off.  Williams introduced him as a kid who had just arrived Nashville, with a borrowed guitar, who heard Orbison was minus a guitar player,  who went over and got the gig. Other musicians on the record included Floyd Cramer on piano, Bob Moore on an upright bass, Boots Randolph and Charlie McCoy on guitar, and Buddy Harman and Paul Garrison on drums. Orbison also played a 12 string epiphone.
The record sold seven million copies and marked the high point in Orbison's career.Lehman, Peter. Roy Orbison: Invention of an Alternative Rock Masculinity.

In 1999, the song was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and was named one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it #222 on their list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time."

[[Probabilistic database]]
CATEGORIES: Database management systems, Types of databases, Database theory, Fuzzy logic

Most real databases contain data whose correctness is uncertain. In order to work with such data, there is a need to quantify the integrity of the data. This is achieved by using probabilistic databases.
A probabilistic database is an uncertain database in which the possible worlds have associated probabilities. Probabilistic database management systems are currently an active area of research. "While there are currently no commercial probabilistic database systems, several research prototypes exist..."Vinod Muthusamy, Haifeng Liu, Hans-Arno Jacobsen: Predictive Publish/Subscribe Matching. University of Toronto.
Probabilistic databases distinguish between the logical data model and the physical representation of the data much like relational databases do in the ANSI-SPARC Architecture.
In probabilistic databases this is even more crucial since such databases have to represent very large numbers of possible worlds, often exponential in the size of one world (a classical database), succinctly.Nilesh N.

[[Emulator]]
CATEGORIES: Emulation software

In computing, an emulator is hardware or software or both that duplicates (or emulates) the functions of one computer system (the guest) in another computer system (the host), different from the first one, so that the emulated behavior closely resembles the behavior of the real system (the guest).
The above described focus on exact reproduction of behavior is in contrast to some other forms of computer simulation, in which an abstract model of a system is being simulated. For example, a computer simulation of a hurricane or a chemical reaction is not emulation.

Steamboat Willie is a 1928 American animated short film directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. It was produced in black-and-white by the Walt Disney Studios and released by Celebrity Productions. The cartoon is considered the debut of Mickey Mouse,Walt Disney Treasures - Mickey Mouse in Black and White (1932) at Amazon.com; the product description of this Disney-produced DVD set describes Steamboat Willie as Mickey's debut. and his girlfriend Minnie, despite both the characters appearing several months earlier in a test screening of Plane Crazy. Steamboat Willie was the third of Mickey's films to be produced, but was the first to be distributed.[tpl]IMDb title|0019422[/tpl]
The film is also notable for being the first cartoon with synchronized sound. It was the first cartoon to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons such as Inkwell Studios' Song Car-Tunes (1924–1927) and Van Beuren Studios' Dinner Time (1928). Also distinguishing Steamboat Willie from earlier sound cartoons was the level of popularity.Steamboat Willie (1929) at Screen Savour
Music for Steamboat Willie was arranged by Wilfred Jackson and Bert Lewis, and included the songs "Steamboat Bill," a 1911 Arthur Collins composition, and "Turkey in the Straw." The title of the film is a parody of the Buster Keaton film Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928),Main Street Cinema website, published by Disney, mentions the connection between the films. itself a reference to the song by Collins. Walt Disney performed all of the voices in the film, although there is little intelligible dialogue.The only spoken words are when Pete mutters "Get down there!" and several times the parrot says "Help! Man overboard!" and "Hope you don't feel hurt, big boy!" - see here
While the film has received some criticism due to humorous depiction of cruelty to animals, it has also received wide critical acclaim, not only for introducing one of the world's most popular cartoon characters, but for its technical innovation. In 1994 members of the animation field voted Steamboat Willie 13th in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons, which listed the greatest cartoons of all time. In 1998 the film was selected for preservation in the United States' National Film Registry for being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

The Library of Congress is the research library that officially serves the United States Congress, but which is the de facto national library of the United States. It is the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States. John Cole argues that it is now the largest and most international library in the world. He attributes that to its highly influential leaders, especially Ainsworth Rand Spofford (1864–97), Herbert Putnam (1899–1939), Luther H. Evans (1945–53), and James H. Billington (1987–). Cole says they, "have affirmed and expanded Thomas Jefferson's concept that the Library of Congress is a national institution that should be universal in scope and widely and freely available to everyone." John Young Cole, "The library of congress becomes a world library, 1815-2005," Libraries & culture (2005) 40#3: 385-398.
Located in four buildings in Washington, D.C., as well as the Packard Campus in Virginia, it is the second largest library in the world by number of items catalogued."General Information". Library of Congress. Retrieved on 17 April 2014. However, such metrics are of limited utility due to the variety of cataloguing methods employed by institutions.
The Library of Congress moved to Washington in 1800, after sitting for eleven years in the temporary national capitals of New York and Philadelphia. The small Congressional Library was housed in the United States Capitol for most of the 19th century until the early 1890s. Most of the original collection had been destroyed by the British in 1814 during the War of 1812. To restore the collection in 1815, former president Thomas Jefferson sold 6,487 books, his entire personal collection, to pay his debts.
After a period of slow growth another fire struck the Library in 1851, in its Capitol chambers, again destroying a large amount of the collection, including many of Jefferson's books. The Library of Congress then began to grow rapidly in both size and importance after the American Civil War and a campaign to purchase replacement copies for volumes that had been burned from other sources, collections and libraries (which had begun to speckle throughout the burgeoning U.S.A.). The Library received the right of transference of all copyrighted works to have two copies deposited of books, maps, illustrations and diagrams printed in the United States.  It also began to build its collections of British and other European works and then of works published throughout the English-speaking world.
This development culminated in the construction during 1888-1894 of a separate, expansive library building across the street from The Capitol, in the "Beaux Arts" architecture style with fine decorations, murals, paintings, marble halls, columns and steps, carved hardwoods and a stained glass dome. It included several stories built underground of steel and cast iron stacks.
The Library's primary mission is researching inquiries made by members of Congress through the establishment of a "Congressional Research Service", established 1914. Although it is open to the public, only high-ranking government officials may check out books and materials. The Library promotes literacy and American literature through projects such as the American Folklife Center, American Memory, Center for the Book and Poet Laureate.

[[Nahuatl honorifics]]
CATEGORIES: Nahuatl, Honorifics

Nahuatl honorifics refers to the set of linguistic elements and morphological systems found in the Nahuatl group of related languages and dialects, that are used to mark degrees of respect and relative social standing and distance for the speaker and subject(s) of discourse. These systems of honorific or reverential address have been noted for both the 16th-century contact-era recorded form (Classical Nahuatl) and its living modern-day descendant Nahuatl dialects and speech communities. The system of honorifics observed for Nahuatl languages is a highly complex one, employing both free and bound morphemes that may attach to nouns, verbs, postpositions and other grammatical elements, providing a gradation of reverential address options whose use is governed by cultural and social norms within the Nahuatl speech community. Linguists have identified at least four distinct levels of honorific address within and among Nahuatl languages and dialects.
The four levels of honor or reverence include an “intimate” or “subordinate” Level I, a “neutral,” “distant” or “first respect” Level II, a “reverential” Level III, and finally, the sacred, “ultra-reverential” compadrazgo Level IV used in religious contexts.
Compadres, or godparents, who are established as kin through religious ritual, are the only members of the community to whom this highest level of reverence is applied. The morphemes used to express these four levels of honor are a linguistic manifestation of the social structure and politeness strategies of Nahuatl culture. Factors such as age, kinship, occupation, fluency in Nahuatl, and the cultural value of compadrazgo are primary in determining the level of reverence one merits. The four levels of honor are supported by a framework of cultural, and especially religious, beliefs and values. Honorific usage also varies slightly among the dialects, a variation closely tied to socioeconomic status, respect for tradition, indigenous solidarity, and a region’s degree of contact with other speech communities.

In Roman mythology, Entoria was the daughter of a Roman countryman. Cronos (Saturn) who was once hospitably received by him, became, by Entoria, the father of four sons: Janus, Hymnus, Faustus, and Felix. 
Cronos taught the father the cultivation of the vine and the preparation of wine, enjoining him to teach his neighbours the same. This was done accordingly, but the country people, who became intoxicated with their new drink, thought it to be poison, and stoned their neighbour to death, whereupon his grandsons hung themselves in their grief.
At a much later time, when the Romans were visited by a plague, they were told by the Delphic oracle, that the plague was a punishment for the outrage committed on Entoria's father, and Lutatius Catulus[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] caused a temple to be erected to Cronos on the Tarpeian rock, and in it an altar with four faces.Plut.

Akbar ([tpl]IPA-ur|əkbər|IPA[/tpl]; 14 October 1542 – 27 October 1605), also known as Akbar the Great or Akbar I,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/akbar-i-mughal-india |title=Akbar I|publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2014-01-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199546091.001.0001/acref-9780199546091-e-209 |title=Akbar I |publisher=Oxford Reference |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2014-01-18[/tpl] was Mughal Emperor from 1556 until his death. He was the third and one of the greatest ruler of the Mughal Dynasty in India. Akbar succeeded his father, Humayun, under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in India. A strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include nearly all of the Indian Subcontinent north of the Godavari river. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire country because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. In order to preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strived to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to himself as an emperor who had near-divine status.
Mughal India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture. Akbar himself was a patron of art and culture. He was fond of literature, and created a library of over 24,000 volumes written in Sanskrit, Hindustani, Persian, Greek, Latin, Arabic and Kashmiri, staffed by many scholars, translators, artists, calligraphers, scribes, bookbinders and readers. Holy men of many faiths, poets, architects and artisans adorned his court from all over the world for study and discussion. Akbar's courts at Delhi, Agra, and Fatehpur Sikri became centers of the arts, letters, and learning. Perso-Islamic culture began to merge and blend with indigenous Indian elements, and a distinct Indo-Persian culture emerged characterised by Mughal style arts, painting, and architecture. Disillusioned with orthodox Islam and perhaps hoping to bring about religious unity within his empire, Akbar promulgated Din-i-Ilahi, a syncretic creed derived from Islam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity. A simple, monotheistic cult, tolerant in outlook, it centered on Akbar as a prophet, for which he drew the ire of the ulema and orthodox Muslims.
Akbar's reign significantly influenced the course of Indian history. During his rule, the Mughal empire tripled in size and wealth. He created a powerful military system and instituted effective political and social reforms. By abolishing the sectarian tax on non-Muslims and appointing them to high civil and military posts, he was the first Mughal ruler to win the trust and loyalty of the native subjects. He had Sanskrit literature translated, participated in native festivals, realizing that a stable empire depended on the co-operation and good-will of his subjects. Thus, the foundations for a multicultural empire under Mughal rule was laid during his reign. Akbar was succeeded as emperor by his son, Jahangir.

ttcp (test TCP) is a utility program for measuring network throughput, popular on Unix systems. It times the transmission and reception of data between two systems using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocols. ttcp command reference 
Created in the 1980s by Mike Muuss and Terry Slattery, ttcp was originally designed for Unix systems but has since been ported to many other systems and can now be used by both Windows and *nix systems alike. History of ttcpJava and C source code 
C Code with Man page and Makefile, sans corporate ads
ttcp for .NET  ttcp is also available on Cisco IOS routers as a hidden command and can be set up as either the sender or receiver.ttcp on Cisco IOS 
Testing can be done from any platform to any other platform, for example from a Windows machine to a Linux machine, as long as they both have a ttcp application installed. For normal use, ttcp is installed on two machines – one will be the sender, the other the receiver.  The receiver is started first and waits for a connection.  Once the two connect, the sending machine sends data to the receiver and displays the overall throughput of the network they traverse.  The amount of data sent and other options are configurable through a simple command line interface. The output is generally displayed by default in KiB/s (kibiBytes per second) instead of kb/s (kilobits per second), but can be configured to be displayed in other ways on some implementations. The reported throughput is more accurately calculated on the receive side than the transmit side, since the transmit operation may complete before all bytes actually have been transmitted.

[[Epagathus]]
CATEGORIES: Political office-holders in ancient Rome, Emperor's slaves and freedmen, 3rd-century Romans

Epagathus was an Ancient Roman politician of the early third century.
He was a profligate freedman, who along with Theocritus, a personage of the same class and stamp with himself, exercised unbounded influence over Caracalla, and was retained in the service of his successor. After the disastrous battle of Antioch in 218, he was despatched by Macrinus to place Diadumenianus under the protection of the Parthian king, Artabanus IV. At a subsequent period we find that the death of the celebrated Domitius Ulpianus was ascribed to his machinations, although the causes and circumstances of that event are involved in deep obscurity.
Alexander Severus, apprehensive lest some tumult should arise at Rome, were he openly to take vengeance on Epagathus, nominated him prefect of Egypt. But soon afterwards Severus recalled Epagathus from there and caused him to be conducted to Crete, and there Epagathus was quietly put to death.Dion. Cass. lxxvii. 21, lxxviii. 39, lxxx. 2.

Ipsita Roy Chakraverti (born Ipsita Chakraverti; November 3, 1950) is a Wiccan priestess based in India. Born into an elite family in India with a diplomat for a father and royalty for mother, Chakraverti spent her early years in Canada and the US where her father was stationed. There, she was allowed to join a select group of women, who were studying ancient cultures of the world and the old ways. Chakraverti studied with them for three years and finally chose Wicca as her religion. After coming back to India and getting married, Chakraverti declared herself as a witch in 1986. Amidst the backlash that followed her declaration, Chakraverti explained to the media regarding the Neo Pagan ways of Wicca and its healing power. 
Chakraverti started administering Wiccan ways of healing to the people of India, including traveling to remote villages and teaching the female population there, who were often accused of black magic and "witchcraft" by the male folk, and were murdered. In 1998, Chakraverti campaigned as an Indian National Congress candidate for the Parliament of India in the Hooghly district, but was not elected. She released her autobiography Beloved Witch in 2003. A second book titled Sacred Evil: Encounters With the Unknown was released in 2006, which chronicled nine case studies during her life as a Wiccan healer and gave explanations as to why those events happened. Both books received positive critical reception. 
The story Sacred Evil from the book was made into a motion picture by Sahara One Pictures. Titled Sacred Evil – A True Story, the film starred Bollywood actress Sarika playing Chakraverti. After its release, the film was a commercial disappointment but received mixed reviews. Chakraverti started the Wiccan Brigade, a platform for those who want to study Wicca which was followed by Bengali TV channel ETV Bangla, creating two tele-serials based on Chakraverti's life and her experience with the paranormal. Chakraverti, who believes that Wicca is the first feminist movement in history, has been credited for bringing a new light on the taboo subject of witchcraft in India, and the rest of the world.

[[Marcus Mettius Epaphroditus]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek grammarians, 1st-century Greek people, Deaths from edema

Marcus Mettius Epaphroditus of Chaeroneia was an Ancient Greek grammarian of the 1st century.
Epaphroditus was a disciple of Archias of Alexandria, and became the slave and afterwards the freedman of Modestus, the prefect of Egypt, whose son Pitelinus had been educated by Epaphroditus. After having obtained his liberty, he went to Rome, where he resided in the reign of Nero and down to the time of Nerva, and enjoyed a very high reputation for his learning. He was extremely fond of books, and is said to have collected a library of 30,000 valuable books. He died of dropsy at the age of seventy-five. 
The Suda, from whom this account is derived, does not specify any work of our grammarian, but concludes by merely saying that he left behind him many good works. We know, however, from other sources, the titles of some grammatical works and commentaries: for example, on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey,Steph. Byz. s. v. Dôdônê; Etym. M. s. vv. aôroi, Kephalênia (cited by Schmitz) an exêgêsis eis omêron kai pindaron,Eudoc. p. 128 (cited by Schmitz) a commentary on Hesiod's "Shield of Heracles," and on the Aitia of Callimachus, which is frequently referred to by Stephanus of Byzantium and the Scholiast on Aeschylus. He is also mentioned several times in the Venetian Scholia on the Iliad.Comp. Visconti, Iconograph. Grecq. i. p. 266. (cited by Schmitz)

CATEGORIES: Adobe Systems

Adobe Pixel Bender, previously codenamed Hydra, is a programming language created by Adobe Systems for the description of image processing algorithms. The syntax is based on GLSL, and a Pixel Bender program is analogous to an OpenGL fragment shader, and is intended to be a loosely typed version of C++.
Adobe Systems' Adobe Pixel Bender Toolkit is the IDE for scripting with Pixel Bender. Pixel Bender programs are intended to be used in a number of Adobe products, and was supported by After Effects (through CS5) and Flash Player. The Pixel Bender Toolkit was bundled with Adobe's Creative Suite, and allowed programs to be created and tested. It is available as a free standalone from Adobe's website.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pixelbender/|title=Pixel Bender Technology Center[/tpl]
In addition to its primary purpose of image processing, Pixel Bender can also be used for general mathematical operations which would benefit from the hardware acceleration that it provides. An example of this is audio processing.http://www.adobe.com/devnet/logged_in/jchurch_flashplayer10.html

[[Tweaked]]

CATEGORIES: Enuff Z'nuff albums, 1995 albums

Tweaked is the 5th studio album and first independently released collection of new material by American rock band Enuff Z'nuff.
Having been earlier presented as a glam rock band in the midst of the grunge movement, Enuff Z'nuff fought to distinguish their sound for their first proper indie release. Although the singles "Bullet From A Gun" and "Life Is Strange" lean toward a modern alternative sound, other tracks such as "My Heroin," "Without Your Love," and "How Am I Supposed To Write A Love Song" were recorded in more of a blues-rock style.
Remaining songs from Tweaked don't veer far from the formula used on earlier Enuff Z'nuff albums. Songs such as "My Dear Dream," "We're All Alright," and "Has Jesus Closed His Eyes" utilize their obvious past influences of Electric Light Orchestra, Cheap Trick and The Beatles. However, Tweaked does mark a noticeable change in direction in that lead guitar prowess was no longer a highlight. This was either due to changing times or because of the removal of guitar prodigy Derek Frigo from the band.
Tweaked was originally conceived to be half of a Japanese released double album. However, the sessions were eventually split into two records, with the other becoming Chip & Donnie's 'Brothers' (later re-released as Enuff Z'Nuff's Seven in 1997). Artwork varies on some copies of this record due to the controversial image of an Irish funeral procession that is featured on the original release.
Tweaked also marks the return of original guitarist Gino Martino to the band, though he would soon leave the group again due to a disdain for touring. Martino would continue to record occasionally with the band on studio material. The album was eventually re-released in 2000 and 2008.

[[Flat Daddy]]
CATEGORIES: Iraq War, Parenting

A Flat Daddy (also Flat Mommy or Flat Soldier) is a life-sized cardboard cut-out of someone absent from home, the idea being to keep connected to family members during a deployment. Flat Daddies came in fashion after the start of the Iraq War when spouses and children were left alone after soldiers were called up for duty. By the mid-2000s (decade), thousands of Flat Daddies have been produced for families in the USA.
The Flat Daddy concept dates back to at least 2003, when Cindy Sorenson of Bismarck, North Dakota created a cutout of her husband who was deployed in Iraq with the North Dakota National Guard. The name was modeled on the 1964 children's book Flat Stanley and a program in which children mailed small cutouts of themselves. The idea was shared by Sorenson with Elaine Dumler, a motivational speaker who mentioned the idea in a book offering coping tips for families with a deploying soldier. Dumler obtained a trademark on the term "Flat Daddy", hoping to prevent anyone from profiting on the idea.Harasim, Paul. "Constant companion", Las Vegas Review-Journal, August 26, 2007. Accessed August 25, 2008. "Dumler said she got a trademark for 'Flat Daddy' to ensure that no one would try to profit from the concept." Dumler filed for the trademark on October 16, 2006, for use as photographs of active duty military personnel mounted on cardboard cut-outs, vinyl, and photo paper and in books in the field of military family readiness. The trademark application indicated that the term was first used in September 2003.Flat Daddy, United States Patent and Trademark Office. Accessed August 25, 2008.
As of 2006, the Maine National Guard had produced 200 "Flat Daddy" and "Flat Mommy" cutouts for the families of soldiers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Maine program was started based on information received at a National Guard conference. The state's family-support director noted the enthusiastic response to the program, stating that "If there's something we can do to make it a little easier on the families, then that's our job and our responsibility. It brings them a little bit closer and might help them somewhere down the line."MacQuarrie, Brian via The Boston Globe. "He's Flat, but He's Home; Life-size replicas comfort families of Guard members", San Francisco Chronicle, August 31, 2006.

Accessed August 25, 2008.
By 2007, a Toledo, Ohio firm had manufactured over 1,000 of the cutout figures. While many of the initial Flat Daddies had been produced gratis, the firm was seeking sponsors for the 50 per week that it was producing.Brickey, Homer.

CATEGORIES: Paris–Roubaix, 1984 in French sport, 1984 in road cycling

The 1984 Paris–Roubaix was undertaken in extremely muddy conditions, reducing the speed of the riders and making the race even harder than usual. 
The race was characterised by a great deal of action early on, but the deciding move came with 45 kilometres to go. At this point Sean Kelly went after two La Redoute riders who were out in front, Gregor Braun and Alain Bondue. Rudy Rogiers came up to Kelly and they chased and caught the La Redoute pair. Braun was soon dropped and  Bondue then crashed, and despite chasing hard, could not regain contact with the front two. At the finish on the Roubaix velodrome, Rogiers had no chance against the dominant Kelly who easily won the sprint for his first Paris–Roubaix win. 
This win came in the middle of an amazing stretch of results for Kelly who later described this period in the first half of 1984 as the best of his career.[ref]

Eperatus (Epiratos) of Pharae in Achaea was an Ancient Greek general of the 3rd century BC.
He was elected strategos of the Achaean League in 219 BC. This was done by the intrigues of Apelles, the adviser of Philip V of Macedon, and in opposition to Timoxenus, who was supported by Aratus of Sicyon. Eperatus was held universally in low estimation, and was in fact totally unfit for his office, on which he entered in 218 BC, so that, when his year had expired, he left numerous difficulties to Aratus, who succeeded him.Polyb. iv. 82, v. 1, 5, 30, 91; Plut.

[[OpenGL Multipipe]]
CATEGORIES: OpenGL, IRIX software

OpenGL Multipipe is the default SGI solution for handling parallel rendering on a single desktop using multiple displays on Irix and Linux.http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?cmd=getdoc&coll=&db=man&fname=/usr/share/catman/u_man/cat1/omp/multipipe.z It first appeared in Irix 6.5.10 as a solution for creating desktops on SGI Onyx Visualization Systems (their so called Reality Centers) which took advantage of multiple Raster/Geometry Managers in multiple pipelines.http://www.sgi.com/products/software/multipipe/overview.html The package was originally composed of Xinerama, a Xinerama aware version of 4DWM (called omp4Dwmhttp://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?cmd=getdoc&coll=&db=man&fname=/usr/share/catman/u_man/cat1/multipipe/start_ompwm.z) and a backend server to handle and distribute all OpenGL threads to the various physical pipes called Transparent OpenGL (or tgl).http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?cmd=getdoc&coll=&db=man&fname=/usr/share/catman/u_man/cat1/multipipe/multipipe.z
In SGI parlance, a pipe (see Graphics pipeline) is akin to a PCI Video Card connected to other cards that handle Geometry and/or Rasterization in a "pipeline" (hence the name and the relevant nature of OpenGL), somewhat similar to 3Dfx's Voodoo Graphics card (though many considered the latter hackish and not at all a true pipe). Nowadays a pipe is solely on a single board and on a single chip (GPU). More to the point, a single SGI pipeline (e.g. InfiniteReality4) could be configured to have up to 8 Video Outputs, each with its own Raster Manager (or 4 with additional Texture memory and a Geometry manager). SGI's Implementation of Xinerama would transparently handle OpenGL on all display outputs (including multiple pipes), but usually offloaded all OpenGL calls to a blanket OpenGL API called transparent OpenGLhttp://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?coll=0650&db=man&fname=/usr/share/catman/u_man/cat1/multipipe/tgl.z(like running Xdmx without Chromium).
Programming for a single display on multiple pipes was always possible in OpenGL using threads (and subsequently in Open Inventor and OpenGL Performer), making them "multipipe aware", but this proved challenging for scientists and architects who cringed at C/C++ multithreading. SGI decided to lighten the burden by developing a package that would encompass a halfway optimized solution for applications programmed for only one pipe via Multipipe.
OpenGL Multipipe was part one of a three tiered approach to escalate applications towards multipipe awareness. The second part was Multipipe SDK which provided a simple set of libraries that made an OpenGL application multipipe aware.http://www.sgi.com/products/software/multipipe The third was moving on to the multipipe aware OpenGL Performer. The latest versions of Multipipe include Xdmx as a better suited solution for multiple displays.http://www.sgi.com/products/software/multipipe/faq.html Ultimately this solution would be superseded by working Xdmx, Xinerama and Chromium in tandem on linux graphics clusters. Programming multiple pipes in OpenGL would be facilitated by Equalizer or by a variety of SceneGraph Libraries.

Starting off as an amateur with Liverpool and Southport he turned down Aston Villa to sign professional forms for Bolton in October 1935.Ponting, Ivan & Hugman, Barry; The Concise Post War History of Bolton Wanderers; 1994, p.11.
He did not make the goalkeepers shirt his own until the 1938-39 season and then his career was interrupted by the Second World War, where he saw service in the Royal Artillery.
He returned to top flight football and stayed playing with Bolton until he was nearly 40. He was Bolton's keeper in the Matthews' Cup Final. When he retired from football he stayed with the club as coach of the reserve side as well as running the post office near Burnden Park.
Stan Hanson had a brother, Alf Hanson, who also played for Liverpool as well as Chelsea.

[[Jose Luis Nazario, Jr.]]
CATEGORIES: United States Marines, People from Riverside, California, 1980 births, Living people

Sergeant Jose Luis Nazario, Jr. (born 1980) is the first American to be tried in a civilian court for war crimes which were allegedly committed while he was on active duty.
Nazario was charged with voluntary manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence for his role in the death of four unarmed Iraqi.
The Iraqis were killed on November 9, 2004, in Fallujah, Iraq, when Nazario was leading a squad of 13 Marines on house to house searches as part of Operation Phantom Fury, during the Second Battle of Fallujah.
Nazario, a former Marine, was charged under the 2000 Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Acthttp://www.pubklaw.com/hi/pl106-523.pdf for the killing of unarmed Iraqi detainees in the city of Falluja.http://www.setexasrecord.com/arguments/216215-legally-speaking-law-and-the-fog-of-war-part-i-of-ii His trial began on August 19, 2008.
Nazario retired from the Marine Corps in 2005.
After his retirement he was to become a Police officer in his home-town of Riverside, California.
The incident became known publicly when one of Nazario's subordinates, Sergeant Ryan Weemer applied for a job with the United States Secret Service.
During his interview he was asked to identify the most serious crime he had participated in, and he described his role in the killing.
Nazario's attorneys told CNN in July 2007 that Nazario totally denied the charges.
Nazario was released on bail, after his arrest.  But, because he was still in his probationary period with the Police when he was arrested, he was dismissed.
In 2010, Nazario sued the Riverside Police, to try force them to re-hire him.
During his trial five of the thirteen subordinates in his squad testified that they were not eye-witnesses to the killings, but they heard the shots fired.
Two of Nazario's subordinates, Sergeant Weemer and Sergeant Jermaine Nelson, faced contempt of court charges for their refusals to testify.
The contempt charges were dropped a month later.
Although he refused to testify during Navario's trial, in September 2009, Jermaine Nelson would later apologize for his role in the killings during his own trial, and place the blame for all the killings on Nazario.
According to The Guardian, during Nelson's trial a tape of a confession Nelson made in 2007 was played, that offered: "a grisly account that Nazario beat detainees, killed two of them by shooting them in the forehead and ordered squad members to kill the other two."
Nazario's trial was held in his home town,  Riverside, California, where he was formerly a police officer.
He was acquitted on August 28, 2008.
Nazario's defense team included Joseph Preis, Jared N. Klein and David Foberg,lawyers from the firm Pepper Hamilton, a firm that had worked previously on behalf of Guantanamo detainees.http://www.pepperlaw.com/pdfs/OCU_Q3_2008.pdf
After US District Court Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled in favor of Riverside in a civil suite Navario launched Richard  K. De Atley of the Press Enterprise wrote that court statements revealed that the main reason Riverside had not re-instated Navario was not that Riverside investigators concluded Navario had in fact killed the Iraqi civilians; rather it was "troubling statements" from Federal wiretaps of Navario's phone, and a "2008 domestic abuse court action".
Navario had sued, based on the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, aking for $6 million in damages.
De Atley quoted a passage from the wiretaps which stated Navario said:  "it was 'fun to ... around with people,' that he gets 'to beat somebody's ... because they're drunk,' ".  De Atley noted that the court papers did not include evidence Navario had beaten vulnerable members of the public for kicks.
The transcripts also recorded Navario discussing how to subvert the reliability of polygraph tests with another police officer.  
According to De Atley in a passage in the wiretap transcripts that had been deemed inadmissable at his manslaughter trial, but had been admissible at his civil suit, Navario described "how to respond directly if asked he had murdered anyone."  De Atley wrote Navario said: "Just be like, yeah, I was in combat. And they waive all that ..."
Navario's lawyers had argued that, if the city decided not to put any weight on the murder allegations once Navario was acquitted they should have dropped the investigation, so they would not have come across the domestic violence court action, or Navario's statements captured in the Federal wiretaps.

[[Chatti Pathiri]]
CATEGORIES: Pastries with poppy seeds, Kerala cuisine

Chatti Pathiri is a layered pastry made in the North Malabar and Malabar region, of Kerala, India. It is made in both sweet and savoury variations. The dish is very similar to the Italian lasagna. Instead of pasta; pastry sheets / pancakes made with flour, egg, oil and water are used. The filling depends on the variation desired. The sweet ones are made with sweetened beaten eggs, nuts and raisins, seasoned with cardamom. The savoury ones are made with traditional meat filling used in making samosas or savoury puffs. The flour is kneaded into soft dough and rolled into thin pancakes. These pancakes are soaked in milk to soften them and arranged in layers. The fillings are added between these layers. Once layered, it goes in for baking at 180 degrees for approximately 20 minutes.
An essential ingredient to enhance the authenticity of the dish is white poppy seeds, used extensively in Malabar cuisine while making biryani and meat stews. It is considered an essential part of any festival, pre- and post-wedding events, and Iftar.

[[Punitive expedition]]

CATEGORIES: Penology, Punitive expeditions

A punitive expedition is a military journey undertaken to punish a state or any group of persons outside the borders of the punishing state. It is usually undertaken in response to perceived disobedient or morally wrong behavior, but may also be a covered[tpl]vague|date=June 2012[/tpl] revenge. More commonly in the 19th century, punitive expeditions were used as pretexts to colonial adventures that resulted in annexations, regime changes or changes in policies of the affected state to favour one or more colonial powers. 
Stowell (1921) provides the following definition:
 "When the territorial sovereign is too weak or is unwilling to enforce respect for international law, a state which is wronged may find it necessary to invade the territory and to chastise the individuals who violate its rights and threaten its security".[tpl]sfn|Stowell|1921|pp=41–42[/tpl]

[[Instant centre of rotation]]

CATEGORIES: Classical mechanics, Kinematics, Rotation

The instant center of rotation, also called instantaneous center or instant center, is the point in a body undergoing planar movement that has zero velocity at a particular instant of time.  At this instant, the velocity vectors of the trajectories of other points in the body generate a circular field around this point which is identical to what is generated by a pure rotation.
Planar movement of a body is often described using a plane figure moving in a two-dimensional plane. The instant center is the point in the moving plane around which all other points are rotating at a specific instant of time.
The continuous movement of a plane has an instant center for every value of the time parameter. This generates a curve called the moving centrode. The points in the fixed plane corresponding to these instant centers form the fixed centrode.

[[Xerobdellidae]]

CATEGORIES: Leeches

Xerobdellidae are a small family of "jawed leeches". The latter might be (but probably are not) a natural, monophyletic group of hirudiniform proboscisless leeches. Xerobdellidae have three jaws and five pairs of eyes, the fourth and fifth being separated by one or two eyeless segments. One each of the mere three genera placed herein occurs in Chile (Mesobdella) and Europe (Xerobdella). Diestecostoma is more widespread and found in Central and northern South America. This peculiar distribution strongly suggests they are a relict Pangaean group, which had already been present by the start of the Jurassic 250 million years ago.Borda et al. (2008)
These leeches resemble the Haemadipsidae and were included there by many authors, but this has always been controversial. Their status as a distinct family is supported by sequence analysis of the nuclear 18S and 28S rDNA and mitochondrial COI genes as well as the anatomy of their sexual organs and nephridia; the latter are located at the belly rather than along the body sides as in the Haemadipsidae proper.
They feed on blood – typically of amphibians – and small invertebrate except Mesobdella, which is exclusively a blood-feeder and has been recorded to attack humans on occasion.

CATEGORIES: 1986 births, Living people, Brazilian long jumpers, Athletes (track and field) at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Athletes (track and field) at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Olympic athletes of Brazil

Mauro Vinicius Hilario Lourenço da Silva, commonly known as Duda (born 26 December 1986) is a Brazilian long jumper. He is the 2-time World Indoor champion, winning the gold medal at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Istanbul, Turkey, and again at the 2014 IAAF World Indoor Championships at Sopot, Poland, on 8 March 2014. He competed at the 2008 Olympic Games without reaching the final, but he did make the final 8 at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
Da Silva jumps off his left leg. His best jump outdoors is 8.31m (27 feet 3-1/4 inches), accomplished at São Paulo, Brazil, on 7 June 2013. His best jump indoors is 8.28 metres (27' 2"), first set on 9 March 2012 during the qualifying rounds of the 14th World Indoor Championships, and matched two years later on 8 March 2014 to win the 15th World Indoor title at Sopot, Poland. Those 8.28m jumps also established a new national indoor record for a Brazilian.
Da Silva's victories at the 2012 and 2014 World Indoor Championships were both come-from-behind wins. At Istanbul, he set a world-leading mark (and national record) of 8.28m during qualifying. But in the Finals the next day, he was in seventh place after his first four jumps, with a best of only 7.77m. On his fifth jump he uncorked 8.23m to take the lead, despite taking off well behind the take-off board (nearly 20 cm behind). In the sixth (final) round, Da Silva hit the take-off board squarely and again reached 8.23m. In the sixth round, Henry Frayne of Australia was in 3rd place but he leaped 8.23m to match Da Silva exactly. The tie-breaking rule thus came into effect, with the final placings decided on the basis of each jumper's second-best marks. Da Silva won the gold medal because of his two jumps of 8.23m, while Frayne's second-best was 8.17m (from the 2nd round). Russia's Aleksandr Menkov won bronze with his 8.22m, set in the 2nd round. Two years later at Sopot, Da Silva barely qualified for the Finals, jumping a season-best 8.02 on his third and final jump, to squeak into the top 8 by one centimeter. The next day he
defended his Indoor title at Sopot on 8 March 2014, again with a come-from-behind jump. He moved from 5th place to first on his sixth-and-final jump, overtaking both China’s Li Jinzhe (2nd with 8.23m) and Sweden’s Michel Torneus (3rd with 8.21m).

Pedro de Lencastre, or Peter of Lencastre (Azeitão, 1608 – Lisbon, 1673), was the youngest son of Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre, 3rd Dukes of Aveiro.
He studied theology in the University of Coimbra and he became successively Bishop of Guarda, Archbishop of Évora and Archbishop of Braga.
In spite of the Portuguese rebellion against the Spanish, his nephew, Raimundo of Lencastre, 4th Duke of Aveiro actively supported the rights of the Habsburg Kings and, in 1663, the new King of the Braganza Dynasty, John IV, decided to confiscate the Dukedom.
However, Peter of Lencastre, a Braganza supporter, requested the cancellation of this decision and, finally in 1668, he was recognised as 5th Duke of Aveiro and Marquis of Torres Novas.
Later the same year, when the peace between Portugal and Spain was signed, Peter’s niece, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, sister and heir of the 4th Duke, requested the cancellation of the decision that granted the Dukedom of Aveiro to her uncle, in order to obtain it for herself.
Due to Peter of Lencastre's death in 1673, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, still living in Spain, was recognised as the new Duchess of Aveiro on condition she would return to Portugal.

[[Ephippus of Olynthus]]

CATEGORIES: Historians who accompanied Alexander the Great, Ancient Olynthians, 4th-century BC historians, 4th-century BC Greek people

For other uses, see Ephippus
Ephippus (Ephippos) of Olynthus was an Ancient Greek historian of Alexander the Great.
It is commonly believed, though no reason is assigned, that Ephippus lived about or shortly after the time of Alexander. There is however a passage in ArrianAnab. iii. 5. § 4 (cited by Schmitz) which would determine the age of Ephippus very accurately, if it could be proved that the Ephippus there mentioned is identical with the historian. Arrian says, that Alexander before leaving Egypt appointed Aeschylus of Rhodes and Ephippus ton Chalkideôs, superintendents (episkopoi) of the administration of Egypt. The reading ton Chalkideôs, though adopted by the recent editors of Arrian, is not in all MSS., and some editions read Chalkidona or Chalkêdona; but if we might amend Chalkideaa, we should have reason for supposing that the person mentioned by Arrian is the same as Ephippus of Olynthus, for Olynthus was the principal town in Chalcidice, and Ephippus might just as well be called a native of Olynthus as of Chalcidice. 
If the Ephippus then in Arrian be the same as the historian, he was a contemporary of Alexander and survived him for some time, for he wrote an account of the king's burial. The work of Ephippus is distinctly referred to by Athenaeus only, though Diodorus and others also seem to have made use of it. Athenaeus calls it in some passages peri tês Alexandron kai Hêphaistiônos metallagês, and in others he has taphês or teleutês instead of metallagês, so that at all events we must conclude that it contained an account of the burial of Alexander as well as of his death.
From the few fragments still extant, it would appear that Ephippus described more the private and personal character of his heroes than their public careers.Athen. iii. p. 120, iv. p. 146, x. p. 434, xii. pp. 537, 538. (cited by Schmitz) It should be remarked that by a singular mistake Suidas in his article Ephippus gives an account of Ephorus of Cumae. 
PlinyElench. lib. xii., xiii. (cited by Schmitz) mentions one Ephippus among the authorities he consulted upon plants, and it is generally believed that he is a different person from our historian; but all the writers whom Pliny mentions along with him, belong to the period of Alexander, so that it is by no means improbable that he may be Ephippus of Olynthus. All that is known about Ephippus and the fragments of his work, is collected by R. Geier, in his Alexandri Magni Histor. Scriptores, actate suppares.Lips. 1844, pp. 309-317. (cited by Schmitz)

Nausea (Latin nausea, from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ναυσία[/tpl] - nausia,ναυσία, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus "ναυτία" - nautia, motion sickness", "feeling sick," "queasy" or "wamble"ναυτία, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33156 |title=Wamble definition  |work= MedTerms Medical Dictionary |accessdate=[/tpl]) is a sensation of unease and discomfort in the upper stomach with an involuntary urge to vomit. It often, but not always, precedes vomiting. A person can suffer nausea without vomiting. (Greek ναῦς - naus, "ship"; ναυσία started as meaning "seasickness".)
Nausea is a non-specific symptom, which means that it has many possible causes.  Some common causes of nausea are motion sickness, dizziness, migraine, fainting, gastroenteritis (stomach infection) or food poisoning. Side effects of many medications including cancer chemotherapy, nauseants or morning sickness in early pregnancy. Nausea may also be caused by anxiety, disgust and depression.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stress-symptoms/SR00008_D |title=Stress symptoms: Effects on your body, feelings and behavior|work= Mayo Clinic [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45852/ |title=Diagnostic Criteria: Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Anxiety|work= PubMed [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://en.diagnosispro.com/disease_information-for/clinical-manifestations-stress-emotional-physical/19955-104.html |title=Disease Information for Stress/Emotional/Physical: Clinical Manifestations |work=[/tpl]

[[Effects of Hurricane Dean in Mexico]]

CATEGORIES: Hurricane Dean, 2007 in Mexico

The effects of Hurricane Dean in Mexico were more severe than anywhere else in the storm's path. Hurricane Dean, the most intense storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the Atlantic Ocean west of Cape Verde on August 14, 2007. The Cape Verde-type hurricane sped through the Caribbean Sea, rapidly intensifying before making landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Accurate forecasts of the storm's location and intensity enabled thorough preparations; nevertheless when the massive storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula as a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale it damaged thousands of homes.
Weakening as it crossed the peninsula, Dean emerged into the Bay of Campeche and re-strengthened before making a second landfall in Veracruz. Although the second landfall did not bring winds as intense as the first, it brought more rainfall and caused devastating landslides in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Between the two landfalls, Dean caused MXN$2 billion (US$184 million; 2007 dollars) of damage and killed 13 people.

[[Satellite insurance]]

CATEGORIES: Types of insurance, Satellites

Satellite insurance is a specialized branch of aviation insurance in which, as of 2000, about 20 insurers worldwide participate directly. Others participate through reinsurance contracts with direct providers. It covers three risks: relaunching the satellite if the launch operation fails; replacing the satellite if it is destroyed, positioned in an improper orbit, or fails in orbit; and liability for damage to third parties caused by the satellite or the launch vehicle.[tpl]cite book | title = Laser Satellite Communication: The Third Generation | first = William H. | last = Mott | first2 = Robert B. | last2 = Sheldon | pages = 142 | publisher = Praeger | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-56720-329-9 [/tpl]
In 1965 the first satellite insurance was placed with Lloyds of London to cover physical damages on pre-launch for the "Early Bird" satellite Intelsat I.  In 1968 coverage was arranged for pre-launch and launch perils for the Intelsat III satellite. Satellites are very complex machines which are manufactured and used by governments and a few larger companies. The budget for a typical satellite project can be in excess of billions of dollars and can run 5–10 years including the planning, manufacturing, testing, and launch.

CATEGORIES: Turks and Caicos Islands culture, National flags, Blue Ensigns, Flags of British Overseas Territories, 1968 introductions

The flag of the Turks and Caicos Islands is similar to the flags of other British dependencies and colonies as it has the Union Flag in the canton.  It was adopted on November 7, 1968. It is a defaced Blue Ensign; the yellow shield is taken from the territory's coat of arms and contains a conch shell, lobster, and cactus. A Red Ensign with the shield is used as civil ensign, which is an informal (yet popular) usage given that this flag has not yet been approved by Order in Council laid before Parliament.
The previous flag used up to 1968 was also a defaced Blue Ensign.  Like many other British territories in the region at the time, it had a circular badge showing a ship offshore from a beach with the name of the islands.  The Turks and Caicos badge also showed a man working on the beach between two piles of salt.   The 1889 Admiralty Flag Book introduced some shading into the right-hand salt pile, interpreted as an insertion of an entrance to what was erroneously thought to be a hut or igloo.Turks and Caicos - Historical Flags

[[Ojos Negros (Azúcar Moreno album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1992 albums, Azúcar Moreno albums

Ojos Negros is the sixth studio album by Spanish duo Azúcar Moreno, released on Sony-Epic in 1992. The album's title translates as Dark Eyes and is a reference to one of the tracks included, the Chilean folk tune "Yo Vendo Unos Ojos Negros".
Ojos Negros, just like preceding album Mambo, was recorded in both London, Madrid and Miami and was a collaboration with acclaimed British producer Nick Patrick. Patrick started his career as a recording engineer for Heaven 17 and B.E.F. in the early 80s and has since gained prominence as a producer and arranger in his own right for a large number of artists in genres as diverse as pop and rock (Roy Orbison, Alain Souchon, Maggie Reilly), world music (Salif Keita, Gipsy Kings, Mory Kante, Youssou N'Dour) and classical (Russell Watson, Dominic Miller, Katherine Jenkins). Patrick's production of Ojos Negros marked a change in musical direction for Azúcar Moreno as it mainly featured live orchestrations including percussion, brass, woodwind and sophisticated string arrangements and that it combined both disco, club and flamenco influenced material with midtempo tracks and romantic ballads like "Vente Conmigo" and "En Tu Calle Sin Salida", and the Salazár sisters adapting their vocal style accordingly, even harmonising on certain titles.
Despite - or because of - this Ojos Negros proved to be a modest commercial success compared to the preceding Bandido and Mambo, both in Spain and Latin America. The album spawned five single releases in 1992 and early 1993, all minor hits; a cover of the Venezuelan standard "Moliendo Café", first made famous by Mario Suárez, "Hazme El Amor", co-written by Spanish singer and composer Miguel Gallardo who would go on to write several of the duo's hits later in the 90s and 2000s, "Veneno", a remixed version of "Azúcarero" and finally "Mirame", a duet with Mexican singer Luis Miguel. "Hazme El Amor" was in 1997 the only track from Ojos Negros to be included on Azúcar Moreno's first greatest hits album Mucho Azúcar - Grandes Éxitos.
Just like Mambo the album was released with alternative cover art in Japan.

Anti-intellectualism is hostility towards and mistrust of intellect, intellectuals, and intellectual pursuits, usually expressed as the derision of education, philosophy, literature, art, and science, as impractical and contemptible. Alternatively, self-described intellectuals who are alleged to fail to adhere to rigorous standards of scholarship may be described as anti-intellectuals although pseudo-intellectualism is a more commonly, and perhaps more accurately, used description for this phenomenon.
In public discourse, anti-intellectuals are usually perceived and publicly present themselves as champions of the common folk—populists against political elitism and academic elitism—proposing that the educated are a social class detached from the everyday concerns of the majority, and that they dominate political discourse and higher education.
Because "anti-intellectual" can be pejorative, defining specific cases of anti-intellectualism can be troublesome; one can object to specific facets of intellectualism or the application thereof without being dismissive of intellectual pursuits in general. Moreover, allegations of anti-intellectualism can constitute an appeal to authority or an appeal to ridicule that attempts to discredit an opponent rather than specifically addressing his or her arguments."It is all too easy for people with more formal schooling to believe they know better than those directly involved a particular problem," Sowell, 2001.
Anti-intellectualism is a common facet of totalitarian dictatorships to oppress political dissent. The Nazi party's populist rhetoric featured anti-intellectualism as a common motif, including Adolf Hitler's political polemic, Mein Kampf. Perhaps its most extreme political form was during the 1970s in Cambodia under the rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, when people were killed for being academics or even for merely wearing eyeglasses (as it suggested literacy) in the Killing Fields.http://www.woroni.com.au/articles/features/trial-khmer-rogue

William II Berthout of Mechelen (died near De Meern, 4 February 1301) was bishop of Utrecht from 1296 to 1301, succeeding Jan II van Sierck.  He was a leader of the Berthout family, which ruled over the Heerlijkheid of Mechelen.
William was appointed without intervention from the chapters by pope Boniface VIII because of his anti-French and pro-English attitude.  He tried in vain to get back his lost lordships of Amstelland and Woerden until the death of count Floris V of Holland.  When he returned from a trip to Rome he found so much opposition to him in the Sticht that he sought refuge in Amersfoort.  In 1300 Boniface VIII suspended him as bishop since he had not paid back debts owed to the papal treasury, but when he paid these debts the suspension was lifted and he remained bishop until his death in battle against a coalition of the Dutch and his own rebellious subjects.  His intended successor as bishop, Adolf II of Waldeck, was passed over in favour of Guy of Avesnes.

[[Aberrant]]

CATEGORIES: White Wolf games, Science fiction role-playing games, Superhero role-playing games, Human-derived fictional species

Aberrant is a role-playing game created by White Wolf Game Studio in 1999, set in 2008 in a world where super-powered humans started appearing one day in 1998.  It is the middle setting in the greater Trinity Universe timeline, chronologically situated about 90 years after Adventure!, White Wolf's Pulp era game, and over a century before the psionic escapades of Trinity/Aeon. The game deals with how the players' meta-human characters (called "novas") fit into a mundane world when they most definitely are not mundane, as well as how the mundane populace react to the sudden emergence of novas.  The original Aberrant product line was discontinued in 2002, though a d20 System version was released in 2004. Onyx Path Publishing has recently acquired the rights to the Trinity Universe and has announced its intention to release a new edition of Aberrant.

This article deals with the diplomatic affairs, foreign policy and international relations of Barbados.
At the political level, these matters are officially handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which answers to the Prime Minister.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs, since November 2008 is: Senator The Hon. Maxine McClean.
Barbados is a moderate political and economic power in the Caribbean region.
Between independence in 1966 and the 1990s, Barbados has used a pro business and investment policy to expand its influence in the world.  Through the usage of its network of international bilateral relations, the country has been able to maintain an independent foreign policy.  Barbados' recent policy has been to focus and strengthen ties with nations that country feels will enhance its diplomacy or foreign trade. Barbados has sought to engage in multilateral diplomacy through the United Nations, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the group of ACP countries, the Organization of American States, and several other agencies which it is engaged.  In 2008 Barbados and the other members of CARICOM signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union and its European Commission.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.bb/index.pl/article1?id=2195973|title=Barbados stands to benefit significantly from its services under the EPA between Europe and Caricom |publisher=Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-05-15[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The deal covers CARICOM's membership in the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM).  CARIFORUM in turn is a part of the Group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) States.  The agreement outlines Barbados' future development and trade ties with the European Union, and serves as a blueprint for future relations between both trading blocs under the Cotonou Agreement and the Lomé Convention.Barbados May Reap Rewards of Treaty Network, Worldwide Tax Dail, 30 April 2009
At times Barbados has found itself as a countervailing force to U.S. political and economic influence in the English-speaking Caribbean.
As a small nation, the primary thrust of Barbados' diplomatic activity has been within international organisations. Currently Barbados has established official diplomatic relations with 105 countries around the globe.

[[Air force]]
CATEGORIES: Air forces

An air force, also known in some countries as an air army, is in the broadest sense, the national military organization that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of a nation's armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic and tactical bombing missions and providing support to ground forces.
The term "air force" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air force, which is an operational formation either within a national air force or comprising several air components from allied nations. Air forces typically consist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and other aircraft.
Many air forces are also responsible for operations of military space, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), and communications equipment. Some air forces may command and control other air defence assets such as antiaircraft artillery, surface-to-air missiles, or anti-ballistic missile warning networks and defensive systems.  Some nations, principally Russia, the former Soviet Union and countries who modelled their militaries along Soviet lines, have an Air Defence Force which is organizationally separate from their air force.
In addition to pilots, air forces have ground support staff who support the aircrew. In a similar manner to civilian airlines, there are supporting ground crew as pilots cannot fly without the assistance of other personnel such as engineers, loadmasters, fuel technicians and mechanics.  However, some supporting personnel such as airfield defence troops, weapons engineers and air intelligence staff do not have equivalent roles in civilian organizations.

Awadh has been greatly influenced by Mughal cooking techniques, and the cuisine of Lucknow bears similarities to those of Persia, Kashmir, Punjab and Hyderabad; and the city is known for Nawabi foods.
The bawarchis and rakabdars of Awadh gave birth to the dum style of cooking or the art of cooking over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today.The Sunday Tribune – Spectrum – Lead Article.

[[Angelo Traina]]
CATEGORIES: 1889 births, 1971 deaths, Translators of the Bible into English, American people of Sicilian descent

Angelo Traina (January 22, 1889 - November 4, 1971), also known as A. B. Traina, was a Biblical scholar, best known for his emphasis on restoring "Semitic proper names to their Aramaic and Hebrew forms".
Traina was born in Sicily, into a Catholic family. They later moved to New York City, where he left home at the age of 13, ending up in Buffalo.  Part of a group of drinking and gambling youths, he was part of a conspiracy to disrupt a revival meeting, but instead converted, joining a Protestant church.  He later worked for Aimee Semple McPherson.
His Biblical studies resulted in his translating the The Sacred Name New Testament (1950), with C. O. Dodd, the first example of a sacred name Bible.  He went on to translate the Hebrew and Aramaic scriptures also, in The Holy Name Bible containing the Holy Name Version of the Old and New Testaments (1963).  A fifth edition was published in 1989 by the Scripture Research Association, based in New Jersey.
He also wrote many pamphlets and articles, many of which were published in the magazine The Faith.  Traina was one of the early figures in the Sacred Name Movement, having been a featured speaker at the 1938 Feast of Tabernacles Camp Meeting near Warrior, Alabama, an event which is seen by some as the launching of the movement.

[[Free Burma Rangers]]
CATEGORIES: Politics of Burma, Christian advocacy groups

The Free Burma Rangers (FBR) are a mainly Christian pro-active, pro-democracy humanitarian group who work throughout Burma (also known as Myanmar) but concentrate primarily on the heavily forested border region, delivering emergency medical assistance to sick and injured internally displaced people, or IDP's; a consequence of the long running campaign of violence by the military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, against Burma's ethnic minorities.
FBR trains teams of men and women in frontline medical treatment and reconnaissance techniques. In addition to delivering humanitarian relief, a secondary role of the teams is to obtain evidence of military violence and human rights abuse. This information is then published in the form of online reports and / or released to larger international human rights groups, inter-governmental organisations such as the UN, and news agencies.
FBR is one of a number of grass roots organisations (see Mae Tao Clinic http://www.maetaoclinic.org/ & Back Pack Health Worker Team http://web.archive.org/web/20091027044634/http://geocities.com/maesothtml/bphwt/) which have emerged in response to the growing health needs of Burma’s persecuted ethnic underclass. FBR are not supported by either the Thai or Burmese authorities and their activity inside the Burmese border is clandestine.

Patrick Chalmers FSA (31 October 1802 – 23 June 1854) was a British soldier, writer and politician.
He was the son of another Patrick Chalmers, a merchant from Aldbar, from whom he inherited Aldbar Castle. After being educated in Germany he studied at Oxford University, which he left before obtaining a degree. He then joined the army, serving in Ireland as part of the 3rd Dragoon Guards, where he rose to the rank of captain. In 1826, after his father's death, he sold his commission and returned to Aldbar. In 1832 he attempted to run for office as the Member of Parliament for Montrose Burghs, but was defeated by Horatio Ross. He ran again in 1835 and succeeded, being reelected in 1837 and 1841. In 1842 he was forced to resign due to ill-health, having an unidentified disease at the base of his spine, becoming the first Member of Parliament to be appointed as Steward of the Manor of Northstead.The Gentleman's Magazine on Google Books
In later life he became an amateur Antiquarian, being appointed a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 24 January 1850 and writing a book The Sculptured Monuments of the County of Angus describing work he had come across. His health returned in later years, with some suggesting that he run for reelection in the next general election, but on a journey with some young relatives on a continental tour in 1854 he was struck by smallpox, immediately followed by a second bout of the spinal disease that had forced him to resign. Under the care of doctors not familiar with him, he contracted dysentery, of which he died on 23 June.

Central United Church is a historic congregation of the United Church of Canada located in the community of Weston, now a neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Founded in [tpl]Start date|1821[/tpl], the church has occupied the same site on Weston Road in Toronto since then.[tpl]cite book|first= Eric|last= Lee|title= The History of Central United Church Weston Ontario, 1821-1996|year= 1996|location= Weston|publisher= Central United Church|page= 2|oclc= 225163345[/tpl]  
The congregation began as part of the Methodist Episcopal Church, a forerunner of both the Methodist Church of Canada (1884) and the United Church of Canada (1925).  The first church building, a log structure, was erected in 1821, followed by a larger brick church constructed in 1849.  The present building, dedicated in 1887, and built in the Gothic Revival style, has been altered and updated on several occasions, but retains the landmark tower.  The tower includes examples of abat-sons.  The church was one of the final projects of William Henry Mallory Sr., architect.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/648 [tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl]
The congregation has a unique musical heritage.  The organ, constructed by Casavant Frères, was dedicated in 1950 as a memorial to members of the congregation who gave their lives in the Second World War.  The Chancellors, a youth choir active from 1968 to 1980, produced five record albums and toured extensively.  
The congregation has been served by several notable clergy, including Egerton Ryerson, historian George Playter and E.A. Pearson, the father of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson.  
Today, the church is well known for outreach into the community through the Weston King Neighbourhood Centre.  The Centre provides meals, education and advocacy.
Michael Kooiman is the minister of Central United Church.

Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has recently signed into law three global warming and energy-related bills that will promote advanced biofuels, support the growth of the clean energy technology industry, and cut the emissions of greenhouse gases within the state.
The Clean Energy Biofuels Act, signed in late July, exempts cellulosic ethanol from the state's gasoline tax, but only if the ethanol achieves a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline. The act also requires all diesel motor fuels and all No. 2 fuel oil sold for heating to include at least 2% "substitute fuel" by July 2010, where substitute fuel is defined as a fuel derived from renewable non-food biomass that achieves at least a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The requirement for both motor diesel fuel and heating oil increases by a percentage point per year until 2013, after which it holds steady 5%. The act also allows the state to expand the requirement to other forms of fuel oil, and it requires the state to work to establish a low-carbon fuel standard under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
In early 2008 August, Governor Patrick signed two additional bills: the Green Jobs Act and the Global Warming Solutions Act. The Green Jobs Act will support the growth of a clean energy technology industry within the state, backed by $68 million in funding over 5 years. The Global Warming Solutions Act requires a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the state to 10%-25% below 1990 levels by 2020 and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Under the act, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection will carry the burdens of determining the baseline level of emissions in 1990 and creating a plan to meet the future emissions limits, including the establishment of interim limits for 2030 and 2040

Home video is a blanket term used for pre-recorded media that is either sold or rented/hired for home cinema entertainment. The term originates from the VHS/Betamax era, when the predominant medium was videotape, but has carried over into current optical disc formats like DVD and Blu-ray Disc and, to a lesser extent, into methods of digital distribution such as Netflix.
The home video business distributes films, telemovies and television series in the form of videos in various formats to the public. These are either bought or rented, then watched privately from the comfort of home by consumers. Most theatrically released films are now released on digital media, both optical (DVD or Blu-ray) and download-based, replacing the largely obsolete VHS (Video Home System) medium. The VCD format remains popular in Asia, though DVDs are gradually gaining popularity.

"I Have a Dream" is a public speech delivered by American civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr. on August 28, 1963, in which he calls for an end to racism in the United States. Delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington, the speech was a defining moment of the American Civil Rights Movement.Hansen, D, D. (2003).  The Dream: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Speech that Inspired a Nation. New York, NY: Harper Collins. p. 177.
Beginning with a reference to the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed millions of slaves in 1863,I Have a Dream: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Future of Multicultural America, James Echols - 2004 King observes that: "one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free".Alexandra Alvarez, "Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" : The Speech Event as Metaphor", Journal of Black Studies 18(3); [tpl]DOI|10.1177/002193478801800306[/tpl]. Toward the end of the speech, King departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised peroration on the theme "I have a dream", prompted by Mahalia Jackson's cry: "Tell them about the dream, Martin!"See Taylor Branch, Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-1963. In this part of the speech, which most excited the listeners and has now become its most famous, King described his dreams of freedom and equality arising from a land of slavery and hatred. Jon Meacham writes that, "With a single phrase, Martin Luther King, Jr. joined Jefferson and Lincoln in the ranks of men who've shaped modern America".[tpl]cite news | title=One Man | work=Time | date=August 26, 2013 | author=Meacham, Jon | page=26[/tpl]  The speech was ranked the top American speech of the 20th century in a 1999 poll of scholars of public address.[tpl]cite web |title=I Have a Dream Speech Leads Top 100 Speeches of the Century |author=Stephen Lucas and Martin Medhurst |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison |date=December 15, 1999 |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/releases/3504.html |accessdate=2006-07-18[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries in Gallipoli

Lala Baba Cemetery is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey. It contains the remains of some of the soldiers killed during World War I during the battles at Gallipoli. This was an eight-month campaign fought by Commonwealth and French forces against Ottoman Empire forces to try to force the Ottoman Empire out of the war which it was hoped would open a supply route from the Mediterranean to Russia through the Dardanelles and Istanbul and to relieve the deadlock on the Western Front.
Several months into the campaign, additional troops were landed at Suvla, just North of the Anzac sector and attacks launched simultaneously from the existing positions. The Suvla landing was intended to capture high ground around the bay, but delays caused by indecision and confusion allowed the defending Turks to reinforce and few of the objectives were achieved.
The cemetery is sited on a small hill, Little Lala Baba, half a mile southwest of a larger, 160 high hill called Lala Baba. Lala Baba was captured on the morning of 7 August 1915, the day after the Suvla Bay Landings, . The cemetery was constructed after the Armistice from isolated graves and the concentration of burials from nine surrounding cemeteries. As well as named grave markers, 53 markers are unnamed and special memorials commemorate 16 soldiers thought to be buried in the cemetery but whose graves have not been identified.

The first season, produced in 2007, was entitled [tpl]Nihongo|Ōkiku Furikabutte|おおきく振りかぶって[/tpl]. It was produced by the Japanese animation studio A-1 Pictures and directed by Tsutomu Mizushima. It was released in English by Funimation under the title Big Windup! – Oofuri.

An additional special episode based on the one shot "The Basic of Basics" was only included in the 9th volume of the DVD's.
The story follows the story of Ren Mihashi, a pitcher who was blamed by his middle school team for their string of losses, and as a result suffers from low self-esteem and transfers to a different high school. There, the school's first baseball team is being formed and Mihashi reluctantly joins as their Ace Pitcher. Assisted by his new teammates (and especially the catcher, Takaya Abe), he grows in stature, confidence and skill, helping his team excel with his own abilities. There are two opening and ending theme songs for the series. The first is [tpl]nihongo|"Dramatic"|ドラマチック|Doramachikku[/tpl], sung by Base Ball Bear, and the second is "Seishun Line" ([tpl]nihongo2|青春ライン[/tpl]), by Ikimonogakari. "Medaka no Mita Niji" ([tpl]nihongo2|メダカの見た虹[/tpl]), performed by Kozue Takada, is the first ending theme, and the second is "Arigatō" ([tpl]nihongo2|ありがとう[/tpl]), by SunSet Swish.
A second season was announced in the 13th volume of the manga. It began in 2010 and was entitled [tpl]Nihongo|Ōkiku Furikabutte ~Natsu no Taikai-hen~|おおきく振りかぶって ～夏の大会編～[/tpl]. It was produced by the same team as the first season and contains thirteen episodes which aired between April 1 and June 24 on several Japanese television networks, such as TBS and MBS.
The story picks up where the first season left off, as the Nishiura High School baseball team continues to compete in the High School Baseball Invitational Tournament with the aim of playing in the finals at legendary Hanshin Kōshien Stadium. The opening theme is [tpl]nihongo|"Natsuzora"|夏空[/tpl], performed by Galileo Galilei, and the ending theme is [tpl]nihongo|"Shisō Densha"|思想電[/tpl], by CureaL.
In 2011, an additional episode taking place between 12 and 13 (in season 2) was included in the last OVA, bringing the total of episodes in season 2 to 14, and the total for the entire anime series to 40.

Fort Berens, also spelled Fort Behrens, was a never-completed establishment of the Hudson's Bay Company on the Fraser River, located immediately across the river from today's town of Lillooet, British Columbia, Canada, in that province's central Fraser Canyon region.  The post was designated and materials ordered for its construction in 1859, and was intended to serve as a supply outlet for the gold rush population of the area, which was the northern centre of gold-mining activity on the Fraser during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush (1858–60).  Although a plot of land was allocated, and building supplies were brought into the site, the post was never constructed and by 1861 orders from company headquarters decommissioned the post and the supplies were removed due to an absence of economic viability with the collapse of the rush.  A "satellite" of Fort Kamloops, the post was named after Henry Hulse Berens, deputy Hudson's Bay Company governor 1856-58 and governor 1858-63.  Immediately adjacent to the site that was to be Fort Berens, just to its north, were the boomtowns of Parsonville (or Parsonsville) and Marysville, which likewise disappeared by the end of the rush, though the Parsonville name remained in use as a tobacco press and farm for the locality for some time. A cable ferry connected the town of Lillooet and the three localities on the east bank of the Fraser.  The route to the Cariboo known as the Old Cariboo Road (not to be confused with the Cariboo Road from Yale) started from the east bank and ran via Pavilion and Clinton to Alexandria.

In algebraic geometry, a stable curve is an algebraic curve that is asymptotically stable in the sense of geometric invariant theory. 
This is equivalent to the condition that it is a complete connected curve whose  only singularities are ordinary double points and whose automorphism group is finite. 
The condition that the automorphism group is finite can be replaced by the condition that it is not of arithmetic genus one and every non-singular rational component meets the other components in at least 3 points [tpl]harv|Deligne|Mumford|1969[/tpl]. 
A semi-stable curve is one satisfying similar conditions, except that the automorphism group is allowed to be reductive rather than finite (or equivalently its connected component may be a torus). Alternatively the condition that non-singular rational components  meet the other components in at least 3  points is replaced by the condition that they meet in at least 2 points. 
Similarly a curve with a finite number of marked points is called stable if it is complete, connected, has only  ordinary double points as singularities, and has  finite automorphism group. For example an elliptic curve (a non-singular genus 1 curve with 1 marked point) is stable.
Over the complex numbers, a connected curve is stable if and only if, after removing all singular and marked points, the universal covers of all its components are isomorphic to the unit disk.

[[SAT Subject Test in World History]]

CATEGORIES: Education in the United States, SAT Subject Tests

The SAT Subject Test in World History is the name of a one-hour multiple choice test given on World History by the College Board.  A student chooses to take it depending on the college entrance requirements.  Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as Achievement Tests; and from 1995 until January 2005, they were known as SAT IIs. The SAT World History is not taken frequently.  Only around 11,000 students take this test, compared to the over-110,000 students who take the United States History Subject Test.http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/SubjTestPercentileRanks.pdf Also, unlike the other Subject Tests that are administered monthly, this test is only administered twice a year; once in December, and once in June. This puts pressure on the applicant, because if the student does poorly, it is difficult to retake it.http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/prof/counselors/tests/sat/2007-08-sat-subject-tests-preparation-booklet.pdf

Whilst bishop of Passau and despite never being ordained priest, he was named as the 68th bishop of Metz by pope John XXII on 4 May 1319 after the bishopric had been vacant for 3 years after the death of Reginald of Bar.  He held this bishopric simultaneously with canon posts at Rouen, Vienne, Clermont, Romans[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl], Saint Juste de Lyon and Cambrai and the post of archdeacon of Worcester.
In 1323 he engaged the château de Condé to Edward I, comte de Bar in the form of a vouerie, in lieu of the 6000 livres which he oweed him.  This debt had been contracted by Edouard's predecessor as comte de Bar, Renaud de Bar.  In 1324 he had to return the château de Chatillon to Henry I, lord of Blamont, which Henry I had entrusted to his predecessor.  As he was continually extracting money from the Metz diocese, it began to protest and Henri resigned the bishopric on August 25, 1325, took up his former seat, and withdrew to the Dauphiné.

Everett Franklin Phillips (1878-1951) was a renowned American apiculturist, scholar, and innovator in the beekeeping field. 
Phillips’ interest in honey bees began during his graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1900s, after which he took on a position with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) where he spearheaded efforts to bring the U.S. beekeeping industry to modern scientific standards. Not only did this work help beekeeping practitioners and scholars, it also played a part in the 400% increase in commercial honey production that Phillips oversaw during World War I. 
In 1924, Phillips joined the faculty of Cornell University as professor of apiculture. There, together with long-time friend and major U.S. apiculturist E. R. Root, he worked to establish a world-class beekeeping library.  An endowment fund started by the New York State Beekeepers’ Association, supplemented with proceeds from the Dyce Honey Patent—an innovation in the production of creamed honey patented by Elton J. Dyce, also of Cornell—made possible the purchase of new library acquisitions over the years. The E. F. Phillips Beekeeping Collection, housed at the A. R. Mann Library at Cornell University, is today one of the largest beekeeping libraries in the world, containing some of the oldest existing beekeeping treatises, complete collections of writings by famed apiculturists such as L. L. Langstroth and Moses Quinby, and an ever-growing number of new publications. Phillips and his wife Mary Geisler Phillips, continued to work at expanding the beekeeping library at Cornell until his death in 1951.

The Twin Cities Hiawatha, often just Hiawatha, was a named passenger train  operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (also known as the Milwaukee Road), and traveled from Chicago to the Twin Cities. The original train takes its name from the epic poem The Song of Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. There are a number of Hiawatha-themed names within the city of Minneapolis, the terminus of the original train. The first Hiawatha ran in 1935; in 1939 the Milwaukee Road introduced a second daily trip between Chicago and Minneapolis. The two trains were known as the Morning Hiawatha and Afternoon Hiawatha, or sometimes the AM Twin Cities Hiawatha and PM Twin Cities Hiawatha. The Milwaukee Road discontinued the Afternoon Hiawatha in 1970 while the Morning Hiawatha continued running until the formation of Amtrak in 1971.

[[Economy of Algeria]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Algeria, OPEC, Economy of the Arab League, African Union member economies

In 2012, the Algerian economy grew by 2.5%, up slightly from 2.4% in 2011. Excluding hydrocarbons, growth has been estimated at 5.8% (up from 5.7% in 2011). Inflation is increasing and is estimated at 8.9% (up from 4.49% in 2011). Despite the financial authorities’ good performance, thanks to modernisation reforms, the budget deficit widened to 3.3% of GDP in 2012 (as against 1.3% in 2011) due to the continuation of the expansionary fiscal policy initiated in 2011 to meet strong social demands in terms of purchasing power, jobs and housing. The oil and gas sector is the country’s main source of revenues, having generated about 70% of total budget receipts. The economy is projected to grow by 3.2% in 2013 and by 4.0% in 2014.
The country’s external position remained comfortable in 2012, with a trade surplus of about USD 27.18 billion. The current-account surplus is estimated at 8.2% of GDP and official foreign-exchange reserves have been estimated at USD 190.7 billion at end-December 2012, or the equivalent of more than three years of imports of non-factor goods and services. Oil and gas export earnings made up more than 97% of total exports.
Algeria has enormous possibilities to boost its economic growth, including huge foreign-exchange reserves derived from oil and gas. A development strategy targeting stronger, sustained growth would create more jobs, especially for young people, and alleviate the housing shortage the country is facing. The national strategic option is therefore to revitalise the process intended to diversify the economy starting with the non-oil sector while deepening the reforms needed for the structural transformation of the economy.http://www.afdb.org/en/countries/north-africa/algeria/algeria-economic-outlook/

The Antonine Wall is a stone and turf fortification built by the Romans across what is now the Central Belt of Scotland, between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. Representing the northernmost frontier barrier of the Roman Empire, it spanned approximately [tpl]convert|63|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] and was about [tpl]convert|3|m|0|abbr=off[/tpl] high and [tpl]convert|5|m|0|abbr=off[/tpl] wide. Security was bolstered by a deep ditch on the northern side. The barrier was the second of two "great walls" created by the Romans in Northern Britain. Its ruins are less evident than the better known Hadrian's Wall to the south.
Construction began in 142 AD at the order of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius, and took about 12 years to complete.
Pressure from the Caledonians may have led Antoninus to send the empire's troops further north. The wall was protected by 16 forts with a number of small fortlets between them; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way. The soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the Caledonians in a number of decorative slabs, twenty of which still survive. Despite this auspicious start the wall was abandoned after only 20 years, and the garrisons relocated back to Hadrian's Wall. In 208 Emperor Septimius Severus re-established legions at the wall and ordered repairs; this has led to the wall being referred to as the Severan Wall. However, the occupation ended only a few years later, and the wall was never fortified again. Most of the wall and its associated fortifications have been destroyed over time, but some remains are still visible. Many of these have come under the care of Historic Scotland and the UNESCO World Heritage Committee.

Reginald of Bar was bishop of Metz from 1302 to 1313.  He was the son of Thiébaut II, count of Bar and his wife Jeanne de Toucy, and the grandson of Henry II of Bar.
He was made canon at Rheims, Laon, Verdun and Cambrai and then, before 1298, archdeacon of Brussels.  He then became archdeacon of Besançon in 1299 before being made canon and 'princier' of Metz in 1301 and provost of la Madeleine in Verdun in 1302.  In mid-1302, he was elected bishop of Metz, but the election was considered irregular since the pope held the privilege of name the holder of this bishopric.  To solve the problem, appease the clergy at Metz and save face, Pope Boniface VIII vetoed the election but then immediately named Reginald as his choice for the bishopric.  He was the only prelate from the archdiocese of Trier to assist at the council of Vienne, called by pope Clement V to suppress the Templars.  Reginald fought against Theobald II, Duke of Lorraine, then against the magistrates of Metz.  He was forced to retire in the messine campaign and died on 4 May 1316, apparently poisoned.

Robert Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon, KG, MC, PC (12 June 1897 – 14 January 1977) was an English Conservative politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1955 to 1957. He was also Foreign Secretary for three periods between 1935 and 1955, including during World War II. He is best known for his outspoken opposition to appeasement in the 1930s; his diplomatic leadership in the 1940s and 1950s; and the failure of his Middle East policy in 1956 that ended his premiership.
Eden's worldwide reputation as an opponent of appeasement, a "Man of Peace", and a skilled diplomat was overshadowed in the second year of his premiership when the United States refused to support the Anglo-French military response to the Suez Crisis, which critics across party lines regarded as an historic setback for British foreign policy, signalling the end of British predominance in the Middle East.David Dutton: Anthony Eden. A Life and Reputation (London, Arnold, 1997). Most historians argue that he made a series of blunders, especially not realising the depth of opposition to military action by the United States.Tony Shaw, Eden, Suez & the Mass Media: Propaganda & Persuasion during the Suez Crisis (1996) Most historians say that Eden completely dominated the British decision-making process in the Suez crisis. However, Jonathan Pearson argues in Sir Anthony Eden and the Suez Crisis: Reluctant Gamble (2002) that Eden was more reluctant and less bellicose than most historians have judged.

Augustus (plural augusti),  [tpl]IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|s|t|ə|s[/tpl];[ref]
 entry "Augustus"[/ref]
[tpl]IPA-la|awˈɡʊstʊs|classical[/tpl], Latin for "majestic," "the increaser," or "venerable", was an ancient Roman title given as both name and title to Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus (often referred to simply as Augustus), Rome's first Emperor. On his death, it became an official title of his successor, and was so used by Roman emperors thereafter. The feminine form, Augusta was used for Roman empresses and other females of the Imperial family. The masculine and feminine forms originated in the time of the Roman Republic, in connection with things considered divine or sacred in traditional Roman religion. Their use as titles for major and minor Roman deities of the Empire associated the Imperial system and Imperial family with traditional Roman virtues and the divine will, and may be considered a feature of the Roman Imperial cult.    
In Rome's Greek-speaking provinces, "Augustus" was translated as sebastos (σεβαστός, "venerable"), or hellenised as augoustos ([tpl]lang|grc|αὔγουστος[/tpl]). After the fall of the Roman Empire, Augustus was sometimes used as a name for men of aristocratic birth, especially in the lands of the Holy Roman Empire. It remains a given name for males.

[[Ankh-Morpork]]
CATEGORIES: Discworld locations, Discworld cities and towns, Fictional city-states

Ankh-Morpork is a fictional city-state which features prominently in Terry Pratchett's Discworld fantasy novels. At first glance the world may seem to be written in medieval fantasy style, however Ankh-Morpork is very much the parody of a modern, multi-cultural metropolis. It may bring to mind London or New York City, several centuries mixed into one, with elements of renaissance Florence (compare the ultra-rational dictator Lord Vetinari who certainly has read or even written himself the Discworld-equivalent of Macchiavelli's "Il Principe"). Pratchett describes this biggest city of Discworld as on the far side of corrupt and polluted, and as subject to outbreaks of comedic violence and brouhaha on a fairly regular basis. Ankh-Morpork is also the mercantile capital of the Discworld. As the series proceeds, Ankh-Morpork is more and more portrayed as multi-cultural (which in this case means multi-species, with increasingly prominent populations of creatures such as dwarfs, trolls, and werewolves) and struggling with modern real-world challenges. Even when it is under attack from a dragon, the vegetable carts still have to come in.
In The Art of Discworld Pratchett explains that the city is similar to Tallinn and central Prague, but adds that it has elements of 18th century London, 19th century Seattle and modern New York City. He also states that since the creation of The Streets of Ankh-Morpork, he has tried to ensure that the descriptions of character movements and locations in the books match the Ankh-Morpork map; this has allowed him, and fans of the series, to visualise the story more clearly.  Ankh-Morpork is also referred to as "The Great Big Wahoonie" on occasions, alluding to "The Great Wen" (London), or to "The Big Apple" (New York). It is stated in the novel 'Moving Pictures' that "There's a saying that all roads lead to Ankh-Morpork. And it's wrong. All roads lead away from Ankh-Morpork, but sometimes people walk along them the wrong way". There are also strong parallels with the political structure, economy, social structure, topography and history of the city-state Florence during the Renaissance.

Approximately 29 nations, all signatory to the Antarctic Treaty, send personnel to perform seasonal (summer) and year-round research on the continent and in its surrounding oceans. The population of persons doing and supporting scientific research on the continent and its nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region covered by the Antarctic Treaty) varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000 personnel including ship's crew and scientists doing onboard research are present in the waters of the treaty region.
At least ten children have been born in West Antarctica. The first was Emilio Marcos Palma, born on January 7, 1978 to Argentine parents at Esperanza, Hope Bay, near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.Emilio Marcos Palma at 30 In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica.

In the novel, ten people who had been complicit in the death(s) of other human beings but either escaped notice or were not subject to legal sanction, are tricked or lured into coming to an island under different pretenses, comprising various different sorts of reasons, mainly for either employment or, for the better off, an unexpected late summer vacation or holiday. Although they are the only people on the island, and cannot escape due to the distance from the mainland and the inclement weather, each guest is killed in a manner seeming to parallel the deaths enumerated in the nursery rhyme.
It is Christie's best-selling novel with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever, and one of the best-selling books of all time.

George Matsumoto (born July 16, 1922) is an American architect and educator who is known for his Modernist designs.
George Matsumoto was born in 1922 in San Francisco, California.  He attended the University of California at Berkeley in architecture, but due to his internment during World War II as were other Japanese-Americans, Matsumoto completed his undergraduate education at Washington University in Saint Louis.  He earned his graduate degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan, studying under Eliel Saarinen.[tpl]Cite journal | title=Ten Things You Should Know about George Matsumoto|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kMYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162v=onepage&q&f=false| publisher = Dwell |date=October 2005 | page=162[/tpl]
Completing his graduate studies in 1945, Matsumoto joined the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill in Chicago and in 1946, joined the firm of Saarinen and Swanson.  While with Saarinen and Swanson, he, along with Terry Waugh and David Greer, won the "Better Chicago Contest" with a cash prize of $10,000. Their winning entry was a comprehensive regional plan for greater Chicago.
Following a year of private practice in Kansas City, Missouri, Matsumoto joined the department of architecture at the University of Oklahoma as an instructor.  A year later, he moved with the head of the school of architecture, Henry L. Kamphoefner, to the new School of Design at North Carolina State University.
Kamphoefner was appointed as the first dean of the School of Design and he brought with him several students and faculty from the University of Oklahoma.  During his tenure at the School of Design Matsumoto won over thirty awards for his housing designs and his achievements were published 
internationally.  Some of his most well-known and acclaimed designs in North Carolina include the George W. Poland residence in Raleigh, N.C., the Matsumoto Residence, also in Raleigh, N.C., the E.M. Lipman Residence in Richmond, V.A., the Milton Julian Residence in Chapel Hill, N.C., the J.Gregory Poole Resident in Raleigh, N.C., which he designed with G. Milton Small, Jr., the Ritcher House in Raleigh, N.C., which he designed with Kamphoefner, and the E.K. Thrower Residence in Sedgefield (Greensboro), N.C.  His houses are notable for their simplicity, rigor and residential interpretation of the International Style.
After leaving the School of Design in 1961, Matsumoto returned to California to teach at the University of California at Berkeley and later opened a successful practice that did work in commercial, educational and recreational work, as well as campus and community planning.  He was elected a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1973.
Currently, Matsumoto is retired and living in Oakland, California.

Ephorus or Ephoros (Ancient Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Ἔφορος[/tpl]), of Kyme in Aeolia, in Asia Minor, was an ancient Greek historian. He is called "the Younger" to distinguish him from Ephorus, his earlier colleague from the same town.
Ephorus the Younger is mentioned only by Suidas, according to whom he wrote a history of Galienus in twenty-seven books, a work on Corinth, one on the Aleuadae, and a few others. The name Galienus in this account, it should be observed, is only a correction of Volaterranus, for the common reading in Suidas is Galênou.Comp. Marx, Ephor. Fragm. p. 7. (cited by Schmitz)

It was forked from NetBSD by project leader Theo de Raadt in late 1995. As well as the operating system, the OpenBSD Project has produced portable versions of numerous subsystems, most notably PF, OpenSSH and OpenNTPD, which are very widely available as packages in other operating systems.
The project is also widely known for the developers' insistence on open-source code and quality documentation, uncompromising position on software licensing, and focus on security and code correctness. The project is coordinated from de Raadt's home in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Its logo and mascot is a pufferfish named Puffy.
OpenBSD includes a number of security features absent or optional in other operating systems, and has a tradition in which developers audit the source code for software bugs and security problems. The project maintains strict policies on licensing and prefers the open-source BSD licence and its variants—in the past this has led to a comprehensive license audit and moves to remove or replace code under licences found less acceptable.
As with most other BSD-based operating systems, the OpenBSD kernel and userland programs, such as the shell and common tools like cat and ps, are developed together in one source code repository. Third-party software is available as binary packages or may be built from source using the ports tree. Also like most modern BSD operating systems, it is capable of running binary code compiled for Linux in a compatible computer architecture at full speed in compatibility mode.
The OpenBSD project maintains ports for 20 different hardware platforms, including the DEC Alpha, Intel i386, Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC, x86-64 and Motorola 68000 processors, Apple's PowerPC machines, Sun SPARC and SPARC64-based computers, the VAX and the Sharp Zaurus. The OpenBSD Foundation was accepted as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=139328676904326&w=2 |title='Google Summer Of Code 2014.' - MARC |publisher=Marc.info |date=2014-02-25 |accessdate=2014-03-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.openbsdfoundation.org/gsoc2014.html |title=GSOC 2014 with the OpenBSD Foundation |publisher=Openbsdfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04[/tpl]

[[Law]]

CATEGORIES: Law, Social concepts, Humanities, Political engineering, Social sciences, Authority

Law is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition,Lord Lloyd of Hampstead. Introduction to Jurisprudence. Third Edition. Stevens & Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. Page 39. but one definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour.Robertson, Crimes against humanity, 90. Laws can be made by legislatures through legislation (resulting in statutes), the executive through decrees and regulations, or judges through binding precedents (normally in common law jurisdictions).  Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including (in some jurisdictions) arbitration agreements that exclude the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.
A general distinction can be made between civil law jurisdictions (including canon and socialist law), in which the legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and common law systems, where judge-made binding precedents are accepted. Historically, religious laws played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, which is still the case in some countries, particularly Islamic, and some religious communities, particularly Jewish Halakha. Sharia law is the world's most widely used religious law.http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law
The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. Criminal law deals with conduct that is considered harmful to social order and in which the guilty party may be imprisoned or fined. Civil law (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of lawsuits (disputes) between individuals or organisations. These resolutions seek to provide a legal remedy (often monetary damages) to the winning litigant.
Under civil law, the following specialties, among others, exist: Contract law regulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on derivatives markets. Property law regulates the transfer and title of personal property and real property. Trust law applies to assets held for investment and financial security. Tort law allows claims for compensation if a person's property is harmed. Constitutional law provides a framework for the creation of law, the protection of human rights and the election of political representatives. Administrative law is used to review the decisions of government agencies. International law governs affairs between sovereign states in activities ranging from trade to military action.
To implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public by public servants, a government's bureaucracy, military, and police are vital. While all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an independent legal profession and a vibrant civil society inform and support their progress[tpl]Citation needed|reason=This whole paragraph sounds like Original Thought.|date=May 2012[/tpl].
Law provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis and sociology. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice. There is an old saying that 'all are equal before the law.'. The author Anatole France said in 1894, "In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread."(France, The Red Lily, Chapter VII). The original French is: "La loi, dans un grand souci d'égalité, interdit aux riches comme aux pauvres de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain.". Writing in 350 BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle declared, "The rule of law is better than the rule of any individual."Aristotle. Politics, Book 3#3:16. n.b. This translation reads, "it is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens" Mikhail Bakunin said: "All law has for its object to confirm and exalt into a system the exploitation of the workers by a ruling class".Stewart and Burgess. Collins Dictionary of Law. HarperCollins Publishers. 1996. ISBN 0 00 470009 0. Page 229. Cicero said "more law, less justice".Cicero, De Officiis, I, 10, 33. Latin: "summum ius, summa iniuria". For the translation given above, see, for example, Adler and Doren, Great Treasury of Western Thought, Bowker, 1977, p 851. Marxist doctrine asserts that law will not be required once the state has withered away."Withering away of the state". Palgrave McMillan Dictionary of Political Thought. 2007.

[[Robert, Duke of Bar]]
CATEGORIES: 1344 births, 1411 deaths, Counts of Bar, Dukes of Bar

Robert I of Bar (8 November 1344 – 12 April 1411) was Marquis of Pont-à-Mousson and Count and then Duke of Bar. He succeeded his elder brother Edward II of Bar as count in 1352, and the county was promoted to a duchy in 1354. Their parents were Henry IV of Bar and Yolande, granddaughter of Robert III, Count of Flanders.
When Robert was less than a year old, his father died and his elder brother, Edward II of Bar, became Count of Bar under their mother's regency. As neither Robert nor Edward had a strong constitution, Yolande obtained a dispensation from Pope Clement VI to allow them to eat meat during periods of abstinence. When his brother Edward died, Robert was still only 7 years old and political problems associated with his mother's continued position as regent had arisen. 
Yolande was on the point of remarrying to Philip of Navarre, count of Longueville, a member of the Navarre family which was attempting to claim the French crown from John the Good. Jeanne of Bar (1295-†1361), countess of Warren and daughter of Henry III of Bar, made known to the king that she was ready to replace Yolande and assume the regency. The Parliament of Paris, by decree of 5 June 1352, declared that the county was under the king's control. John the Good then entrusted the regency to Jeanne on 27 July of that year. Yolande initially renounced the regency, but then went back on her decision, levying troops to fight Jeanne. John the Good intervened to force Yolande to renounce the regency again on 2 July 1353.
In 1354 the County of Bar was raised to the status of "duchy", either by the king of France, the Emperor Charles IV or by Robert's own act of usurpation. That same year another possession, Pont-à-Mousson, was raised to a marquisate by the Emperor. Subsequent emperors recognised Robert's ducal title and his state's right to a vote in the Imperial Diet. It is unclear if Robert was regarded as a Peer of France after becoming duke.
The defeat of Poitiers and the capture of John the Good in 1356 deprived Jeanne of John's support and Yolande retook the regency. Robert was knighted in December 1356 and declared of age on 8 November 1359.  He assisted at the coronation of Charles V of France at Reims on 9 May 1364, then at that of Charles VI of France on 4 November 1380. During Charles V's reign he fought in several engagements  in 1374 during the campaign to eject the English from Normandy.  In 1401, Robert ceded his duchy to his son Edward, but reserved the usufruct on it, bypassing his grandson Robert (son of Henry of Bar). The younger Robert unsuccessfully opposed this in the parliament of Paris that ran from 1406 to 1409. Charles VI's madness put him under the control of the Duke of Orleans and Duke of Burgundy.  The elder Robert supported the duke of Orleans, and after that duke's assassination was more and more inclined to remain within his duchy. In his later years he suffered from attacks of gout that prevented him from walking.

The song has most recently been used on CBS' period-drama Swingtown, at the end of episode 2, "Love Will Find a Way" (creating something of an anachronism, as the episode was set in 1976, two years before the song was released).

[[Younger (title)]]
CATEGORIES: British society, Scottish society, Titles, Feudalism in Scotland

Younger is a Scottish convention, style of address or description traditionally used by the Heir Apparent to:-
1. A current Laird (owner of a substantial and landed estate in Scotland) 
2. Someone whose name includes a territorial designation (i.e. a family who were previously Lairds but who are no longer - this applies mainly to armigerous families who had a territorial designation which formed part of their name. Their arms being registered with the inclusion of the territorial designation, having become landless, still retain the full name - including the territorial designation - pertaining to the Grant of Arms) 
3. A Scottish chieftainship (the head of a cadet branch of a clan which has a chief)
4. A clan chief.
5. A Scottish Baron, only if also a Laird (as above) and recognised by the Lord Lyon as such.http://www.scotsbarons.org/male_heir.htm
The style of using the term "Younger" applies equally to a woman who is heir in her own right as to a man. The style of  "Younger" is neither a title of nobility nor a peerage and does not carry voting rights either in the Parliament of Scotland or the Kingdom of England. The abbreviation of Younger is Yr. The wife of such an heir may adopt this style also. 
When a person bearing this suffix becomes the Laird in their own right or succeeds to the arms of a now landless family or inherits the chieftainship of a cadet branch or the chiefship of the clan, they then drop the suffix and the next heir apparent may add the style to their name.

[[Fan fiction]]

CATEGORIES: Fan fiction

Fan fiction, or fanfiction (often abbreviated as fan fic, fanfic, or simply fic), is a broadly defined fan labor term for stories about characters or settings written by fans of the original work, rather than by the original creator. Works of fan fiction are rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work's owner, creator, or publisher; also, they are almost never professionally published. Due to these works' not being published, stories often contain a disclaimer stating that the creator of the work owns none of the original characters. Fan fiction is defined by being both related to its subject's canonical fictional universe and simultaneously existing outside the canon of that universe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1017613/fan-fiction |title=Fan Fiction - Literature |author=Schulz, Nancy |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=April 24, 2008[/tpl] Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore tend to presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based.

Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah  ([tpl]lang-ur| غلام حسین هدايت الله [/tpl], [tpl]lang-sd|غلام حسين هدايت الله[/tpl]) was a politician from Sindh, Pakistan.
Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah was born in 1879 at Shikarpur and received his education from Shikarpur High School, Sindh Madressah, Karachi, D. J. Sindh College, Karachi and Government Law College, Bombay.
After completing his LL.B. in 1902, he started his legal practice in Hyderabad Sindh. He started his public career as Vice President of the Hyderabad Municipality. Hidayatullah was also the first Non-official President of the Hyderabad District Board. In 1921 he became a Member of the Bombay Legislative Council.
In the same year, he was appointed a Minister in the Bombay Government, an office which he occupied till 1928 when he was made a Member of the Executive council of the Governor of Bombay. He served in this capacity til11934.
As a Minister, Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah was associated with the famous 'Sukkur Barrage project' which contributed so much to the prosperity of Sindh in later years. He was awarded the titles of 'Khan Bahadur', 'Knight' and 'The K.C.S.I.' but renounced all his titles when the Muslim League in 1946 decided on a policy of renunciation of titles conferred by the British Government.
Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, along with Khan Bahadur Muhammad Ayub Khuhro, Syed Miran Shah and Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, represented Sindh in the Round Table Conferences in London.
They convinced the Chairman of the 'Committee on Sindh' that Sindh was not to be a deficit province and had sufficient revenue and administrative capability to be a full fledged province. Sindh was separated from Bombay and its first assembly came into being in 1937.
After the separation of Sindh from Bombay Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah became the first Chief Minister and remained so until 1947 with two short breaks when Allah Bux Soomro and Mir Bande Ali Talpur had formed their Governments. Sir Ghulam Hussain became the Chief Minister of Sindh three times.
In 1938, the Sindh Assembly passed a resolution demanding a separate homeland for the Muslims of India. In 1943, the Sindh Government became the first Provincial Assembly of the sub-continent to pass an official resolution in favour of the creation of Pakistan.
After independence Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah earned the unique distinction of being the only Pakistani Governor of a Province in Pakistan as all other Governors were British. This shows the faith and trust the Quaid-e-Azam laid in him.
Within a month of the passing away of the Quaid-e-Azam, Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah the "Grand Old Man of Sindh" died in Karachi on the October 4, 1948.

A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely connected or tightly connected computers that work together so that in many respects they can be viewed as a single system.
The components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through fast local area networks ("LAN"), with each node (computer used as a server) running its own instance of an operating system. Computer clusters emerged as a result of convergence of a number of computing trends including the availability of low cost microprocessors, high speed networks, and software for high performance distributed computing.
Clusters are usually deployed to improve performance and availability over that of a single computer, while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability.[tpl]cite web|first=David|last=Bader|authorlink=David A.

[[BITNET]]

CATEGORIES: History of telecommunications, Wide area networks

BITNET was a cooperative USA university computer network founded in 1981 by Ira Fuchs at the City University of New York (CUNY) and Greydon Freeman at Yale University.[tpl]cite web|last=CREN|title=A Brief History of "Bit.net"|url=http://bit.net/|accessdate=August 30, 2012[/tpl]  The first network link was between CUNY and Yale.
The requirements for a college or university to join BITNET were simple:
From a technical point of view, BITNET differed from the Internet in that it was a point-to-point "store and forward" network. That is, email messages and files were transmitted in their entirety from one server to the next until reaching their destination. From this perspective, BITNET was more like Usenet.
BITNET came to mean "Because It's Time Network", although the original meaning was "Because It's There Network".[tpl]cite book|last=Gillies, Cailliau|first=James, Robert|title=How the Web was Born|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-286207-3|pages=74, 75[/tpl]
Bitnet's NJE (Network Job Entry) network protocols, called RSCS, were used for the huge IBM internal network known as VNET. BITNET links originally ran at 9600 baud. The BITNET protocols were eventually ported to non-IBM mainframe operating systems, and became particularly widely implemented under VAX/VMS in addition to DECnet.
At its zenith around 1991, BITNET extended to almost 500 organizations and 3,000 nodes, all educational institutions. It spanned North America (in Canada it was known as NetNorth), Europe (as EARN), Israel (as ISRAEARN), India (TIFR) and some Persian Gulf states (as GulfNet).  BITNET was also very popular in other parts of the world, especially in South America, where about 200 nodes were implemented and heavily used in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With the rapid growth of TCP/IP systems and the Internet in the early 1990s, and the rapid abandonment of the base platform (IBM mainframe) for academic purposes, BITNET's popularity and use diminished quickly.
The non-profit, educational policies, however well intended, limited exchange with commercial entities, including IBM itself when it came to assistance and software bug fixes. This became a particular problem on heterogeneous networks when trying to communicate assistance with graphical workstation vendors like Silicon Graphics.
BITNET featured email and the LISTSERV software, but predated the World Wide Web, the common use of FTP, and Gopher. It also supported interactive transmission of files and messages to other users. A gateway service called TRICKLE enabled users to request files from Internet FTP servers in 64 Kb UUencoded chunks. The Interchat Relay Network, popularly known as Bitnet Relay, was the network's instant messaging feature.  Bitnet’s first electronic magazine, VM/COM, began as a University of Maine newsletter and surfaced broadly in early 1984.  Two email newsletters that began as Bitnet newsletters in the fall of 1987 are known to still be transmitting. They are the Electronic Air and SCUP Email News (formerly SCUP Bitnet News).
In 1984, a text-based BITNET game called MAD became the first global Multi-User Dungeon (MUD).  Players connected from the USA, Europe or Israel to a single server running in France.
In 1996, CREN ended their support for BITNET.  The individual nodes were free to keep their phone lines up as long as they wished, but as nodes dropped out, the network splintered into parts that were inaccessible from each other. As of 2007, BITNET has essentially ceased operation. However, a successor, BITNET II, which transmits information via the Internet using BITNET protocols, still has some users.

In Multiplicibus Curis was an encyclical given by Pope Pius XII on 24 October 1948 at Castel Gandolfo, near Rome, in the tenth year of his Pontificate. The encyclical repeated the Vatican's prior attitude to its concerns in the Holy Land and came at a time when the 1948 Arab–Israeli War was still raging, but after Israel went on the offensive in Operation Yoav. 
In the encyclical, Pope Pius expressed concern at what he called "the destruction and damage of sacred buildings and charitable places built around the Holy Places" scattered throughout Palestine especially in Jerusalem.In Multiplicibus, para. 2 
While "condemning any recourse to violence", the Pope stated that "peace could only be realized in truth and justice; that is to say by respecting the rights of acquired traditions."In Multiplicibus, para. 3
The Pope sought to maintain the Holy See's official attitude of impartiality in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict but also looked for possibilities for justice and peace in Palestine and for the respect and protection of the Holy Places.In Multiplicibus, para. 4 The Pope also expressed concern for the plight of "the unhappy victims of the war" (which was understood to refer especially to Palestinian refugees).In Multiplicibus, para. 6
The Pope repeated his call for Jerusalem and its outskirts be given an international character, which would "offer a better guarantee for the protection of the sanctuaries". He also called for international guarantees of "free access to Holy Places scattered throughout Palestine, and the freedom of worship and the respect of customs and religious traditions".In Multiplicibus, para.  8

CATEGORIES: Cybernetics, Systems theory

In science and engineering, a black box is a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its input, output and transfer characteristics without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is "opaque" (black).  Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a transistor, an algorithm, or the human brain.
The opposite  of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is sometimes known as a clear box, a glass box, or a white box.

[[Coronet Industries]]

CATEGORIES: Companies based in Florida, Superfund sites in Florida

[tpl]cite book|last=Prophet|first=Wallace|title=Coronet:  A Personal Reminiscence|year=1998|publisher=Self|location=Plant City, FL|pages=146[/tpl] [tpl]refimprove|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Coronet Industries Incorporated is a chemical company that operated a plant converting phosphate to animal feed located in Hillsborough County just four miles outside of Plant City, Florida. The plant operated for almost 100 years under several corporate ownerships before closing in March 2004 in the midst of an investigation by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the State of Florida, and the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County.  
The company was originally organized as the Coronet Phosphate Company in 1906.  The processing plant near Plant City was constructed and began mining operations in 1908.  The phosphate was mined from the surrounding land holdings by a combination of dragline removal of the soil above the phosphate deposits (overburden) and hydraulic pressure stripping.  The raw phosphate material was then transported to the processing plant where it was dried and stored for later shipment.  The phosphae deposits in the nearby area were generally mined out by the 1920s, and mining operations shifted to the Hopewell area about 15 miles south of Plant City.  In 1913 The Coronet Company purchased the Pembroke Mine facility, located between Fort Meade and Bartow in Polk County, from the French company, Compagnie Generale des Phosphates de la Florida. In addition to the Pembroke Mine, the Coronet Company operated mining facilities at a number of other sites it acquired in Hillsborough and Polk Counties.  Operations at the main Plant City plant consisted solely of the drying of the rock material and its shipment to users by rail until 1945 when the plant was expanded to allow institution of a defluorinating process involving a chemical treatment of the rock.  Deluorination allowed the conversion of phosphate to an animal feed supplement, Coronet Defluorinated Phosphate (CDP), which became the principal product of the company in later years.
Construction at the original plant site, Coronet Village, included approximately 75 houses for both white and black plant and mine employees.  Because public roads and highways were somewhat primitive and private automobiles were not very common, having employees live near to the processing plant was desirable.  The Pembroke Mine also had a fairly extensive employee housing village.  Less extensive employee housing facilities were also constructed at the other mining sites.  Both the Coronet and Pembroke Village sites were generally self-contained small towns with a company store, recreation facilities, and water and sewage infrastructure.  These small self-supporting company villages were fairly common in the Florida phosphate industry from the early 1900s until about 1960.  
The Coronet Phosphate Company continued operating as an independent company until its purchase in 1952 by the Smith-Douglass Corporation of Norfolk, Virginia.  Then, in 1964 Smith-Douglass was acquired by the Borden Company who, in turn, sold the company to Consolidated Minerals, Inc.  Finally, that company sold the Coronet facilities to two Japanese firms, Onoda Chemical Industry Company, Ltd., and Mitsui & Company, the present owners.  They operated Coronet under the current name, Coronet Industries, Inc.  In the course of these various changes in ownership and the change from a strictly drying operation to the institution of the CDP treatment, a concern developed in the surrounding area over whether the Coronet operations were producing adverse environmental effects on the nearby housing and agricultural areas.
Residents of the surrounding community alleged that pollution from the plant leached into the groundwater and caused increased rates of cancer amongst other health problems. Arsenic, boron, cadmium, lead and other dangerous chemicals were detected in residential wells surrounding the plant. The federal Environmental Protection Agency cautioned state officials about potential health risks associated with leaky equipment and corroded stacks allowing underwater leaching and spills from Coronet, but residents were not notified of ongoing problems with the company's lack of environmental controls.  The state Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Struhs expressed concern over "potential systemic problems that prevented the situation from being identified and corrected sooner" in the Tampa office of the DEP. Legislation requiring the state of Florida to notify area residents in such events was proposed.
A 2006 report by the state of Florida said that those who were exposed to the Coronet site after 2003 were at no health risk, although there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about those who were exposed before that time.
Approximately 1,200 residents who live near the plant and former employees of Coronet Industries have filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, alleging amongst other things that the pollution from the plant has harmed their health and lowered property values. Coronet, at the time it was shut down in 2004, was owned by Japan based Mitsui and Onoda Chemical. Previous owners include Borden Chemical, Smith-Douglas and Browne Gregg. The residents were initially represented by Masry & Vititoe, the firm which employed famous environmental activist Erin Brockovich, among other law firms.

On Good Friday, the pope recalls the passion of  Jesus Christ, and the land in which he lived, shed His blood and died.  Although the fighting has ended, these holy places are now faced with difficulties and uncertainty, so Pope Pius XII.Redemptoris Nostri Cruciatus  1-5  The Pope mentioned the numerous refugees who live in exile and even in concentration camps.Redemptoris Nostri Cruciatus  5 He asks for more systematic efforts to allow those people a life in peace.  He repeats his call for internationalization of the holy Places:
This would provide  immunity and protection  guaranteed to all the Holy Places of Palestine not only in Jerusalem but also in the other cities and villages as well.  Religious sanctuaries, many of which suffered war damages, should be protected by definite statute guaranteed by an "international" agreement.Redemptoris Nostri Cruciatus  12   The Pope instructs the many Catholic institutions in Palestine to help the poor, to educate youth and give hospitality to visitors. They should  carry out unimpeded the work they did in the past.Redemptoris Nostri Cruciatus  15  The Holy Places, which Catholics during many centuries have acquired and time and again defended,  should be preserved inviolate.Redemptoris Nostri Cruciatus  16

John Jay Burroughs (1798–1872) was an American lawyer and Clerk of the Circuit Court for Princess Anne County, Virginia (now the city of Virginia Beach).
Burroughs was born in either Essex County or Middlesex County, Virginia on October 10, 1798.  He was the eldest child of lighthouse builder and keeper Elzy Burroughs.
Burroughs became the longest serving Clerk of the Circuit Court for Princess Anne County Virginia in its history.  During the American Civil War, Burroughs was the only functioning remnant of civil government in the county while it was occupied by Union forces. Burroughs entered his court career at age 17 in 1815 as a writer for the Hustings Court in Norfolk.  In 1817 he qualified as Deputy Clerk, and in 1819 qualified as the Deputy Clerk of the Circuit Court of Princess Anne County Virginia.  In 1821 he assumed the Clerkship upon the death of the incumbent clerk, remaining in this position until he was removed by the order of Union General Early in May 1869.  
Two of Burroughs' sons were John J. ("Jack") Burroughs, Jr. and Judge William Henry Burroughs, both prominent local attorneys and businessmen in Princess Anne County history.  Jack Burroughs was educated at the Galt Academy in Norfolk and later at Lynchburg College in Lynchburg Virginia.  William H. Burroughs attended The Virginia Military Institute, graduating in 1851 and the Law School of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, graduating in 1854.
Burroughs' descendants remained prominent in Princess Anne County government and politics until the early 1930s, when a "throw the bums out attitude", rising out of the din of the economic Depression, led to a wholesale change of county leadership.
Burroughs was considered a progressive for his day, and was active in the efforts of the American Colonization Society to assist former slaves from Virginia to voluntarily resettle in the new nation of Liberia, in West Africa.  There was little interest from the County's former slaves in this initiative, however.
In recognition of his important role in Princess Anne County history, Mr. Burroughs' portrait hangs on the wall within the modern Virginia Beach Municipal Center.

[[Economy of Antigua and Barbuda]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Antigua and Barbuda, World Trade Organization member economies

Antigua and Barbuda's economy is service-based, with tourism and government services representing the key sources of employment and income. Tourism accounts directly or indirectly for more than half of GDP and is also the principal earner of foreign exchange in Antigua and Barbuda. However, a series of violent hurricanes since 1995 resulted in serious damage to tourist infrastructure and periods of sharp reductions in visitor numbers. In 1999 the budding offshore financial sector was seriously hurt by financial sanctions imposed by the United States and United Kingdom as a result of the loosening of its money-laundering controls. The government has made efforts to comply with international demands in order to get the sanctions lifted. The dual island nation's agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the US, which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals. Estimated overall economic growth for 2000 was 2.5%. Inflation has trended down going from above 2 percent in the 1995-99 period and estimated at 0 percent in 2000.
To lessen its vulnerability to natural disasters, Antigua has been diversifying its economy. Transportation, communications and financial services are becoming important.
Antigua is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) issues a common currency (the East Caribbean dollar) for all members of the ECCU. The ECCB also manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in its member countries.
Antigua and Barbuda is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative. Its 1998 exports to the U.S. were valued at about US $3 million and its U.S. imports totaled about US $84 million. It also belongs to the predominantly English-speaking Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

The females lay a vast number of eggs upon grass stems near water. The larvae are aquatic, active, armed with strong sharp mandibles, and breathe by means of seven pairs of abdominal branchial filaments. When full sized, which takes between one and two years, they leave the water and spend a quiescent pupal stage on the land before metamorphosis into the sexually mature insect. Adult alderflies stay near to the water, in which they had lived in when they were younger.

The 2008 Kvalserien was played between 19 March and 10 April 2008. The top two ranked teams, which were Brynäs and Rögle, qualified for the 2008–09 Elitserien season.
This year's Kvalserien maybe was one of the closest ones ever; the excitement went on until the end, when 4 out of 6 teams all had 16 points before the final round and had the chance to qualify for the 2008–09 Elitserien season. In the final round, Rögle beat former Elitserien club Mora at home 3–2 and Brynäs beat Västerås away 7–0, which made Brynäs win the group, followed by Rögle. Before the qualification began, no one believed Rögle could qualify, but they surprised everyone and qualified for the 2008–09 Elitserien season, despite finishing only third in HockeyAllsvenskan. Brynäs finished last in the 2007–08 Elitserien season, but succeeded to win the qualification and thus managed to stay in the highest division. Rögle's game-winning goal against Mora in the final round was scored with 26 seconds left of regulation time.
Leksand were a big disappointment for everyone; they were one of the favourites to have a possibility to qualify, but failed. Even Malmö were one of the favourites, having 15 points after the first six rounds and topping the Kvalserien at that time, but the team only managed two more points in the last four games.
Västerås was by far the worst team in the qualification. They were the 5th team in HockeyAllsvenskan and qualified for the qualification in a kind-of-playoff series between the teams from 4 to 7 in HockeyAllsvenskan to compete for the last spot in the qualification rounds for Elitserien. Västerås' only win in the 2008 Kvalserien came against Malmö.

The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) or Chagos Islands is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom situated in the Indian Ocean halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia. The territory comprises the six atolls of the Chagos Archipelago with over 1,000 individual islands[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]many tiny[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]amounting to a total land area of [tpl]convert|60|km2|sqmi[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| title=British Indian Ocean Territory| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html| publisher=Central Intelligence Agency| work=World Factbook| date=27 March 2013| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl]
The largest island is Diego Garcia, [tpl]convert|44|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], the site of a joint military facility of the United Kingdom and the United States. Following the eviction of the native population (Chagossians) in the 1960s, the only inhabitants are US and British military personnel and associated contractors, who collectively number around 4,000 (2004 figures).
Mauritius sought to resume control over the Chagos Archipelago which was split from its territory by the UK in 1965 to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. Between 1968 and 1973, the Chagossians, then numbering about 2,000 people, were expelled by the British government to Mauritius and Seychelles to allow the United States to establish a military base on the island. Today, the exiled Chagossians are still trying to return, claiming that the forced expulsion and dispossession was illegal (see Depopulation of Diego Garcia).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13882233|title=Mauritius profile|year=2011|publisher=BBC World|accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chagosinternational.org/files/page_detail.php?id1=127&lang=1|title=HISTORICAL BACKGROUND - WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO ?|publisher=chagosinternational.org|accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl]

During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) established numerous airfields in Kentucky for training pilots and aircrews of USAAF fighters and bombers.
Most of these airfields were under the command of First Air Force or the Army Air Forces Training Command (AAFTC) (A predecessor of the current-day United States Air Force Air Education and Training Command).  However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.
It is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.

Baldrick is the name of several fictional characters featured in the long-running BBC historic comedy television series Blackadder. Each one serves as Edmund Blackadder's servant and sidekick and acts as a foil to the lead character. Each series of Blackadder is set in a different period in British history, and each Baldrick character (as with the character of Edmund) is a descendant of the Baldrick from the preceding series. Just as Blackadder exists in many incarnations throughout the ages, so does Baldrick; whenever there is a Blackadder there is a Baldrick serving him. They are all portrayed by Sir Tony Robinson (although in the unaired pilot episode he was played by Philip Fox).
The relationship between Edmund and Baldrick evolves significantly; in the first series of the show, Baldrick is more intelligent than Blackadder, but this dynamic is reversed in subsequent series, with Baldrick's intelligence decreasing as the show continued. He is the only character other than Edmund Blackadder to appear in every episode of the programme.

[[Borda count]]
CATEGORIES: Single-winner electoral systems, Preferential electoral systems

The Borda count is a single-winner election method in which voters rank options or candidates in order of preference.  The Borda count, BC, determines the outcome of a debate or the winner of an election by giving each option or candidate a certain number of points corresponding to the position in which it, or he or she, is ranked by each voter. Once all votes have been counted the option or candidate with the most points is the winner. Because it sometimes elects broadly acceptable options or candidates, rather than those preferred by the majority, the Borda count is often described as a consensus-based voting system, rather than a majoritarian one.  The BC, or rather the Modified Borda Count, MBC, is ideally suited for decision-making; for elections, and especially when proportional representation is important, the appropriate methodology is the Quota Borda System, QBS.
The Borda count was developed independently several times, but is named for the 18th-century French mathematician and political scientist Jean-Charles de Borda, who devised the system in 1770. It is currently used for the election of two ethnic minority members of the National Assembly of Slovenia,http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Slovenia/Slovenia_ElecParl_excerpts_English.htm "Slovenia's electoral law" for election of members of the Parliament of Nauru, and in modified forms, for apportionment of all seats in the Icelandic parliamentary elections and for selecting presidential election candidates in Kiribati. It is also used throughout the world by various private organizations and competitions.

Baptism for the dead, vicarious baptism or proxy baptism today commonly refers to the religious practice of baptizing a person on behalf of one who is dead—a living person receiving the ordinance on behalf of a deceased person.
Baptism for the dead is best known as a doctrine of the Latter Day Saint movement, which has practiced it since 1840.  It is currently practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), where it is performed only in dedicated temples, as well as in several other current factions of the Latter-day Saint movement.  Those who practice this rite view baptism as an indispensable requirement to enter the Kingdom of God, and thus practice baptism for the dead to offer it by proxy to those who died without the opportunity to receive it. The LDS Church teaches that those who have died may choose to accept or reject the baptism done on their behalf.
The modern term itself is derived from a phrase "baptised for the dead" occurring in one verse of the New Testament ([tpl]sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=15|verse=29[/tpl]), though the meaning of that phrase is an open question among scholars. Early heresiologists Epiphanius of Salamis (Panarion 28) and Chrysostom (Homilies 40) attributed the practice respectively to the Cerinthians and to the Marcionites, whom they identified as heretical "Gnostic" groups.Everett Ferguson Baptism in the early church: history, theology, and liturgy   2009 p299 "Tertullian twice in an antiheretical context comments on 1 Corinthians 15:29, “ baptism for the dead.”4 Later writers say the Marcionites practiced baptism on behalf of the dead.5 It was also said that they ..." For that reason, the practice was forbidden by the Catholic Church, and is not practiced in modern mainstream Christianity, whether Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Protestant.

[[Demographics of Brunei]]
CATEGORIES: Demographics by country, Bruneian society

This article is about the demographic features of the population of Brunei, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. Like neighbouring countries, Brunei is a Malay-dominated country.  Many cultural and linguistic differences make Brunei Malays distinct from the larger Malay populations in nearby Malaysia and Indonesia, even though they are ethnically related and share the Muslim religion.
Brunei has a hereditary nobility with the title Pengiran these are, more often than not, related to the Sultan by blood. The Sultan can award to commoners the title Pehin, the equivalent of a life peerage awarded in the United Kingdom. The Sultan also can award his subjects the Dato, the equivalent of a knighthood in the United Kingdom, and Datin, the equivalent of a damehood.
Bruneians adhere to the practice of using complete full names with all titles, including the title Haji (for men) or Hajjah (for women) for those who have made the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. Many Brunei Malay women wear the tudong, a traditional head covering. Men wear the songkok, a traditional Malay cap. Men who have completed the Haj wear a white songkok.
The requirements to attain Brunei citizenship include passing tests in Malay culture, customs and language. Stateless permanent residents of Brunei are given International Certificates of Identity, which allow them to travel overseas. The majority of Brunei's Chinese are permanent residents, and many are stateless.
Petroleum wealth allows the Brunei Government to provide the population with one of Asia's finest health care systems. The Brunei Medical and Health Department introduced the region's first government "flying doctor service" in early 1965. Malaria has been eradicated, and cholera is virtually nonexistent. There are three general hospitals--in Bandar Seri Begawan, Tutong, and Kuala Belait--and there are numerous health clinics throughout the country.
Education starts with preschool, followed by 6 years of primary education and up to 6 years of secondary education. Nine years of education are mandatory. Most of Brunei's college students attend universities and other institutions abroad, but approximately 2,542 study at the University of Brunei Darussalam. Opened in 1985, the university has a faculty of over 300 instructors and is located on a sprawling campus at Tungku, overlooking the South China Sea.
The official language is Malay, but English is widely understood and used in business. Other languages spoken are several Chinese dialects, Iban, and a number of native dialects. Islam is the official religion, but religious freedom is guaranteed under the constitution.

Originally released in December 2008 for Japanese audiences, the game was made available in English in Europe and North America the following March.  The game's development was led by project head Osamu Komuta, who had previously been a planner for Suikoden Tactics, with a music staff composed of Norikaku Miura, Yoshino Aoki, Masaharu Iwata, and Kaori Komuro.  The game features the opening and ending theme songs "Tears in the Sky" and "Tierkreis" respectively, each performed by Japanese pop idol Satomi Takasugi.
Created as a spin-off of the main series of games, Suikoden Tierkreis was made to explore one of the myriad of worlds that exist in the Suikoden metaverse. Following the game's main theme of "the infinite possibility of future", players must assume the role of an unnamed young male protagonist to gather the combined forces of 108 heroes and defeat a powerful villain known as The One King, leader of The Order of the One True Way, who seeks to control the world by spreading his doctrine that all fate is predetermined and all people have no control of their lives.

[[Affreightment]]

CATEGORIES: Commercial item transport and distribution, Admiralty law, Legal terms

Affreightment (from freight) is a legal term used in shipping.
A contract of affreightment is a contract between a ship-owner and another person (called the charterer), in which the ship-owner agrees to carry goods for the charterer in the ship, or to give the charterer the use of the whole or part of the ship's cargo-carrying space for the carriage of goods on a specified voyage or voyages or for a specified time. The charterer agrees to pay a specified price, called freight, for the carriage of the goods or the use of the ship.
A ship may be let, like a house, to a person who takes possession and control of it for a specified term. The person who hires a ship in this way occupies during the specified time the position of ship-owner. The contract under which a ship is so let may be called a charter-party—but it is not, properly speaking, a contract of affreightment, and is mentioned here only to clarify the distinction between a charter-party of this kind, which is sometimes called a demise of the ship, and a charter-party that is a contract of affreightment.

The ship was initially armed with a main battery of four [tpl]convert|15|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] and eight [tpl]convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] guns, which by 1896 was replaced with twelve new model 15 cm guns. She was the first ship in the German Navy to feature a three-shaft propeller arrangement.
Kaiserin Augusta served abroad between 1897 and 1902, primarily in the East Asia Squadron under the command of Admiral Otto von Diederichs. During this time, the ship's crew assisted in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. In 1902, she returned to Germany for an extensive overhaul that lasted until 1907, after which she went into reserve. Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Kaiserin Augusta was mobilized to serve as a gunnery training ship. She served in this role throughout the war; the ship was ultimately sold for scrapping in October 1919 and broken up the following year.

[[Alternative dispute resolution]]
CATEGORIES: Dispute resolution

Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) (also known as external dispute resolution in some countries, such as AustraliaAustralian Securities and Investments Commission - Complaints resolution schemes. Asic.gov.au. Retrieved on 2013-07-14.) includes dispute resolution processes and techniques that act as a means for disagreeing parties to come to an agreement short of litigation. It is a collective term for the ways that parties can settle disputes, with (or without) the help of a third party. Despite historic resistance to ADR by many popular parties and their advocates, ADR has gained widespread acceptance among both the general public and the legal profession in recent years. In fact, some courts now require some parties to resort to ADR of some type, usually mediation, before permitting the parties' cases to be tried (indeed the European Mediation Directive (2008) expressly contemplates so-called "compulsory" mediation; this means that attendance is compulsory, not that settlement must be reached through mediation). The rising popularity of ADR can be explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts, the perception that ADR imposes fewer costs than litigation, a preference for confidentiality, and the desire of some parties to have greater control over the selection of the individual or individuals who will decide their dispute.Totaro, Gianna., “Avoid court at all costs” The Australian Financial Review Nov. 14 2008. (April 19, 2010) Some of the senior judiciary in certain jurisdictions (of which England and Wales is one) are strongly in favour of the use of mediation to settle disputes.http://ssrn.com/abstract=1599420

Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish: عبد المجيد اول ‘Abdü’l-Mecīd-i evvel) (23/25 April 1823 – 25 June 1861) was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 3 His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into the Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father Mahmud II and effectively started the modernization of Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him.

He was succeeded by his brother Mehmed V. Abdul Hamid's removal from the throne was hailed by most Ottoman citizens, who welcomed the return to constitutional rule, which had been suspended for decades after his dissolution of the Ottoman parliament and constitution in 1878 had ended the first constitutional era and given him absolute control for 30 years.Kinross, Patrick (1977) The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire London: Perennial. ISBN 978-0-688-08093-8. p. 576.
Despite his conservatism and belief in absolute monarchy, Abdul Hamid was responsible for some modest modernization of the Ottoman Empire during his long reign, including reform of the bureaucracy, the ambitious Hijaz Railway project, the establishment of a system for population registration and control over the press, and the founding of the first modern law school in 1898. Between 1871 and 1908, the Sublime Porte thus reached a new degree of organizational elaboration and articulation,Carter Vaughn Vaughn Findley, 'Bureaucratic Reform in the Ottoman Empire: The Sublime Porte, 1789-1922,' Chapter, 6, 'Restoring political balance: the first constitutional period and return to sultanic domanace.

The Abwehr was a German military intelligence (information gathering) organization from 1921 to 1944. The term Abwehr ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈapveːɐ̯|[/tpl], German for defence) was used as a concession to Allied demands that Germany's post–World War I intelligence activities be for "defensive" purposes only. After 4 February 1938, its name in title was Foreign Affairs/Defence Office of the Armed Forces High Command (Amt Ausland/Abwehr im Oberkommando der Wehrmacht).
Despite its name implying counterespionage, the Abwehr was an intelligence-gathering agency and dealt exclusively with human intelligence, especially raw intelligence reports from field agents and other sources.  The Chief of the Abwehr reported directly to the High Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW).  Intelligence summaries and intelligence dissemination were the prerogative of the Operations Branch (as distinct from the Intelligence Branch) of the OKW, and through it to the intelligence-evaluation sections of the Army (Heer), the Navy (Kriegsmarine), and the Air Force (Luftwaffe).When Hitler replaced the Ministry of War with the OKW, the Abwehr became its intelligence agency, although with some degree of independence therefrom.  OKW did not establish an Intelligence Branch in its Operations Staff until 1943, and when it did, it only consisted of three officers.  The headquarters (HQ) of the Abwehr were located at 76/78 Tirpitzufer, Berlin, adjacent to the offices of the OKW.Despite the location of its HQ, in reality the power lay in the field via the "Abwehrstelle" or "Ast" of the Abwehr—see section titled 1938 reorganisation.
The Abwehr has a poor reputation for the quality of its work.[tpl]cite book|author=M. E.

He adds that it was under the "negligent rule" of Admiral Canaris, who was "more interested in anti-Nazi intrigue than in his official duties."  For the first two years of the war, Trevor-Roper says, it was a "happy parasite" that was "borne along...on the success of the German Army." However, as the tide turned against the Nazis, the Abwehr was unable to produce the intelligence the leadership demanded, and it merged into the SS in 1944.H. R.

An assault rifle is a selective fire (selective between semi-automatic, fully automatic and/or burst fire) rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/39165/assault-rifle |title="Assault rifle." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 3 July 2010 |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26[/tpl]  Assault rifles are the standard service rifles in most modern armies. Note the difference between the assault rifle and the battle rifle. Assault rifles use smaller cartridges and are used at closer ranges than battle rifles. The larger sized rifle cartridges used in battle rifles make fully automatic fire more difficult. Fully automatic fire refers to an ability for a rifle to fire continuously while the trigger is pressed and held;  "burst-capable" fire refers to an ability of a rifle to fire a small yet fixed multiple number of rounds with but one press of the trigger; in contrast, semi-automatic refers to an ability to fire one round per press of a trigger regardless of how long the trigger is held. The presence of selective fire modes on assault rifles permits more efficient use of rounds to be fired for specific needs, versus having a single mode of operation, such as fully automatic, thereby conserving ammunition while maximizing on-target accuracy and effectiveness.
Examples of assault rifles include the StG 44, AK-47,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/04/13/000016406_20070413145045/Rendered/PDF/wps4202.pdf |title=Worldbank.

The assault rifle became the standard military rifle during the Vietnam War.Rose p. 373, 380, 392 The Soviet Union was the first nation in the post-war era to adopt an assault rifle, the AK-47, and other nations followed later. Combat experience during the World Wars had shown that most infantry combat took place at 200–300 meters (220–330 yards) distance and that the winner of any given firefight would most likely be the one with the highest rate of fire. The rifle cartridges of the day were therefore unnecessarily powerful, producing recoil and report in exchange for marginal benefit. The lower power of the intermediate cartridge meant that each soldier could fire more bullets faster and/or with less recoil and its lighter weight allowed more ammunition to be carried.

CATEGORIES: Products introduced in 1981, Acorn Computers, 6502-based home computers, Home computers, BBC computer literacy projects

The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, was a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company for the BBC Computer Literacy Project, operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation.  Designed with an emphasis on education, it was notable for its ruggedness, expandability and the quality of its operating system.
After the Literacy Project's call for bids for a computer to accompany the TV programmes and literature, Acorn won the contract with the Proton, a successor of its Atom computer prototyped at short notice. Renamed the BBC Micro, the system was adopted by most schools in the United Kingdom, changing Acorn's fortunes. It was also moderately successful as a home computer in the UK despite its high cost. Acorn also employed the machine to simulate and develop the ARM architecture which is much used for embedded systems. Globally, as of 2013, ARM is the most widely used 32-bit instruction set architecture in terms of quantity produced.[tpl]cite web |last=Hachman |first=Mark |title=ARM Cores Climb into 3G Territory |publisher=ExtremeTech |year=2002 |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/52180-arm-cores-climb-into-3g-territory[/tpl]
While nine models were eventually produced with the BBC brand, the phrase "BBC Micro" is usually used colloquially to refer to the first six (Model A, B, B+64, B+128, Master 128, and Master Compact), with the subsequent models considered as part of Acorn's Archimedes series.

Brand is the "name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's product distinct from those of other sellers."American Marketing Association Dictionary. Retrieved 2011-06-29. The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project. Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising. Initially, livestock branding was adopted to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron. A modern example of a brand is Coca-Cola which belongs to the Coca-Cola Company.
In accounting, a brand defined as an intangible asset is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value, and brand valuation is an important management technique that ascribes a money value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.
The word "brand" is often used as a metonym referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand.
Marque or make are often used to denote a brand of motor vehicle, which may be distinguished from a car model. A concept brand is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like breast cancer awareness or environmentalism, rather than a specific product, service, or business. A commodity brand is a brand associated with a commodity.  Got milk? is an example of a commodity brand.

Belize has a small, essentially private enterprise economy that is based primarily on agriculture, tourism, and services. The cultivation of newly discovered crude oil in the town of Spanish Lookout has presented new prospects and problems for this developing nation.Burnett, John (2006). Maya Homeland. Large Oil Field Is Found in Belize; the Angling Begins, 4 January 2007. Besides petroleum, Belize's other primary exports are citrus, sugar, and bananas. Belize's trade deficit has been growing, mostly as a result of low export prices for sugar and bananas.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] The new government faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been promised, but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the exchange rate under pressure. The Belize Dollar is fixed to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 2:1.
Domestic industry is limited, constrained by relatively high-cost labour and energy and a small domestic market. Tourism attracts the most foreign direct investment although significant foreign investment is also found in the energy, telecommunications, and agricultural sectors.

[[Summi Maeroris]]

Summi Maeroris  is one of several  peace encyclicals of Pope Pius XII focusing in particular on the dangers to peace during the Holy Year . It was given at Rome, at St. Peter's on July 19, 1950, the twelfth day of his Pontificate.
The Pope portrays a mixed picture of his time: on one hand there are millions of people who come to Rome as pilgrims from all nations of the world. They give testimony of oneness in faith, brotherly unity, and piety.  On the other, the present social conditions of the people give reason for high anxiety and concern. The call for hate and class-warfare is not going to solve any problems.Summi Maeroris 3  They need to be tackled not with violence but by the law of justice.  In addition, the spectre of another war is looming.
Real peace is only possible on the basis of Christian principles: Such principles and norms, in fact, recall men to truth, justice and charity; they put a restraint on their unruly desires; they force the senses to be obedient to reason; they move the reason to obey God; they produce this effect, "that all men, even those who are rulers of the peoples, may recognize the freedom that is due to religion, which, beyond its primary purpose of leading souls to eternal salvation, has also another, of safeguarding and protecting the very foundations of the State."Summi Maeroris 9
But, referring to Eastern Europe and China, without mentioning these countries, the Pope continues, in some parts of the world, these principles are trampled upon and the rights of the Church are violated.  They forbid her ministers the free exercise of religious worship. They even condemn them to exile and to prison. They impede or directly proscribe and destroy schools and institutes of education which are conducted according to Christian norms and principles.Summi Maeroris 9 There was always persecution and armed violence against the Church.Summi Maeroris 12. The Church desires to win over peoples and to educate them to virtue and right social living, not by means of arms but with the truth.Summi Maeroris 12.

[[Annexation]]
CATEGORIES: International law, Political geography, Sovereignty

Annexation (Latin ad, to, and nexus, joining) is the permanent acquisition and incorporation of some territorial entity into another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous).[tpl]Citation |first=David M. |last=Edelstein |title=Occupational Hazards: Why Military Occupations Succeed or Fail |journal=International Security |volume=29 |number=1 |date=Summer 2004 |pages=49–91[/tpl] Usually, it is implied that the territory and population being annexed is the smaller, more peripheral, and weaker of the two merging entities, barring physical size. It can also imply a certain measure of coercion, expansionism or unilateralism on the part of the stronger of the merging entities. Because of this, more positive euphemisms like political union/unification or reunification are sometimes seen in discourse. Annexation differs from cession and amalgamation, because unlike cession where territory is given or sold through treaty, or amalgamation (where the authorities of both sides are asked if they agree with the merge), annexation is a unilateral act where territory is seized and held by one state and legitimized via general recognition by the other international bodies (i.e. countries and intergovernmental organisations).[tpl]EB1911|inline=1| |wstitle=Annexation[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Annexation|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/26334/annexation|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=20 March 2014[/tpl]
During World War II, the use of annexation deprived whole populations of the safeguards provided by international laws governing military occupations. The authors of the Fourth Geneva Convention made a point of "giving these rules an absolute character", thus making it much more difficult for a state to bypass international law through the use of annexation.Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.
