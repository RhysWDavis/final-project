[[Bhajan]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu prayer and meditation, Bhakti movement, Indian styles of music, Hindu music

A Bhajan is any type of Hindu devotional song. It has no fixed form: it may be as simple as a mantra or kirtan or as sophisticated as the dhrupad or kriti with music based on classical ragas and talas.David Courtney: http://www.chandrakantha.com/articles/indian_music/bhajan.html It is normally lyrical, expressing love for the Divine. The name, a cognate of bhakti, meaning religious devotion, suggests its importance to the bhakti movement that spread from the south of India throughout the entire subcontinent in the Moghul era.
Anecdotes and episodes from scriptures, the teachings of saints and descriptions of gods have all been the subject of bhajans. The Dhrupad style, Sufi qawwaliAnna King, John Brockington, The Intimate Other: Love Divine in Indic Religions, Orient Longman 2005, p 359. and the kirtan or song in the Haridasi tradition are related to bhajan. Nanak, Kabir, Meera, Narottama Dasa, Surdas and Tulsidas are notable composers. Traditions of bhajan such as Nirguni, Gorakhanathi, Vallabhapanthi, Ashtachhap, Madhura-bhakti and the traditional South Indian form Sampradya Bhajan each have their own repertoire and methods of singing.

George Girard (October 7, 1930 – January 18, 1957) was a New Orleans jazz trumpeter.  He was known for his great technical ability, playing in a style that combined traditional New Orleans Dixieland jazz with the big-band-style trumpet, and a member of the Basin Street Six.
Girard was born in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. In highschool he studied music under Johnny Wiggs and became a professional musician immediately after graduating in 1946. He played and toured with the bands of Johnny Archer and Phil Zito before cofounding the band The Basin Street Six, made up mostly of friends he had grown up with, including clarinetist Pete Fountain. The band got a regular gig at L'Enfant's Restaurant in New Orleans, as well as regular television broadcasts over WWL. The band started receiving favorable national attention, but Girard was dissatisfied with it and broke up the band in 1954 to found his own band, George Girard & the New Orleans Five which included trombonist Bob Havens, drummer Paul Edwards, and bassist Bob Coquille.Al Hirt "Swingin' Dixie" at Dan's Pier 600 in New Orleans, Audio Fidelity Sterodisc AFSD 5877. Girard landed a residency at the Famous Door in the French Quarter, recorded for several labels, and got a weekly broadcast on CBS.

William Whittingham (c. 1524-1579) was an English Biblical scholar, Bible translator, exile from Marian policies of persecution, well-connected friend of English reformers, publisher of the Geneva Bible, an English Dean, preacher before Queen Elizabeth, and a Protestant, Reformed and Anglican reformer.  Educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, he became a Protestant and Reformed Churchman; as such, it was necessary to flee to France when Mary I ascended the throne of England and initiated her policies of hostility and persecutions against Reformed Churchmen.
By 1554, Whittingham made his way to Frankfurt, Germany, where he joined a group of Protestant exiles from Mary's reign.  There, he met John Knox and became a supporter of Reformed Theology, a force that would inform and shape later Elizabethan divines. (This would later be pushed back by Laudian forces of anti-Calvinism in the 17th century.) He also married the sister of John Calvin. He took over Knox's role as established, ordained and recognized minister to the English congregation of exiles in Geneva.  In Geneva, he started the work for which he is best remembered, a Bible translation that came to be known as the Geneva Bible.
In 1560, Whittingham returned to England, and was made dean of Durham in 1563, an office he held at his death in 1579--a Protestant, Reformed, Genevan, Prayer Book and Anglican divine.

Metatron (Hebrew מטטרון) or Mattatron (a differentiation of Metatron"GEMAṬRIA: Metatron". Jewish Encyclopedia) is an archangel in Judaism and in Christian folklore. According to Jewish medieval apocrypha, he is Enoch, ancestor of Noah, transformed into an angel. There are no references to Metatron as an angel in the Jewish Tanakh or Christian scriptures (Old and New Testament);  however, Genesis 5:24 is often cited as evidence of Enoch's bodily ascension into heaven —"And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him."[tpl]cite web|title=Genesis 5:24|url=http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm|work=Bible Hub|publisher=The Biblos Foundation|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] Although he is mentioned in a few brief passages in the Talmud, Metatron appears primarily in medieval Jewish mystical texts and other post-scriptural esoteric sources, such as the Books of Enoch:1 Enoch: Book of Parables, 2 Enoch, and 3 Enoch.  In Rabbinic tradition, he is the highest of the angels and serves as the celestial scribe."Metatron". Britannica Online Encyclopedia.

[[Orthogonal group]]

CATEGORIES: Lie groups, Quadratic forms, Euclidean symmetries

In mathematics, the orthogonal group of dimension n, denoted O(n), is the group of distance-preserving transformations of a Euclidean space of dimension n that preserve a fixed point, where the group operation is given by composing transformations. Equivalently, it is the group of n×n orthogonal matrices of a given dimension, where the group operation is given by matrix multiplication, and an orthogonal matrix is a real matrix whose inverse equals its transpose.
The determinant of an orthogonal matrix being either 1 or −1, an important subgroup of O(n) is the special orthogonal group, denoted SO(n), of the orthogonal matrices of determinant 1. This group is also called the rotation group, because, in dimensions 2 and 3, its elements are the usual rotations around a point (in dimension 2) or a line (in dimension 3). In low dimension, these groups have been widely studied, see SO(2), SO(3) and SO(4).
The term "orthogonal group" may also refer to a generalization of the above case: the group of invertible linear operators that preserve a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form or quadratic formFor base fields of characteristic not 2, it is equivalent to use bilinear forms or quadratic forms. But in characteristic 2 these notions differ. on a vector space over a field. 
In particular, when the bilinear form is the scalar product on the vector space [tpl]math|F n[/tpl] of dimension [tpl]mvar|n[/tpl] over a field [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl], with quadratic form the sum of squares, then the corresponding orthogonal group, denoted [tpl]math|O(n, F )[/tpl], is the set of [tpl]math|n × n[/tpl] orthogonal matrices with entries from [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl], with the group operation of matrix multiplication. This is a subgroup of the general linear group [tpl]math|GL(n, F )[/tpl] given by
where [tpl]mvar|Q[/tpl]T is the transpose of [tpl]mvar|Q[/tpl] and [tpl]math|I[/tpl] is the identity matrix.
This article mainly discusses the orthogonal groups of quadratic forms that may be expressed over some bases as the dot product; over the reals, they are the positive definite quadratic forms. Over the reals, for any non-degenerate quadratic form, there is a basis, on which the matrix of the form is a diagonal matrix such that the diagonal entries are either 1 or −1. Thus the orthogonal group depends only on the numbers of 1 and of −1, and is denoted O(p, q), where p is the number of ones and q the number of −1. For details, see indefinite orthogonal group.
The derived subgroup [tpl]math|Ω(n, F )[/tpl] of [tpl]math|O(n, F)[/tpl] is an often studied object because, when [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] is a finite field, [tpl]math|Ω(n, F )[/tpl] is often[tpl]clarify|date=February 2013[/tpl] a central extension of a finite simple group.
Both [tpl]math|O(n, F )[/tpl] and [tpl]math|SO(n, F )[/tpl] are algebraic groups, because the condition that a matrix be orthogonal, i.e. have its own transpose as inverse, can be expressed as a set of polynomial equations in the entries of the matrix. The Cartan–Dieudonné theorem describes the structure of the orthogonal group for a non-singular form.

[[Center of mass]]

CATEGORIES: Classical mechanics, Mass, Geometric centers

In physics, the center of mass of a distribution of mass in space is the unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero.  The distribution of mass is balanced around the center of mass and the average of the weighted position coordinates of the distributed mass defines its coordinates.  Calculations in mechanics are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass.
In the case of a single rigid body, the center of mass is fixed in relation to the body, and if the body has uniform density, it will be located at the centroid.  The center of mass may be located outside the physical body, as is sometimes the case for hollow or open-shaped objects, such as a horseshoe.  In the case of a distribution of separate bodies, such as the planets of the Solar System, the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual member of the system.
The center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in mechanics that involve masses distributed in space, such as the linear and angular momentum of planetary bodies and rigid body dynamics. In orbital mechanics, the equations of motion of planets are formulated as point masses located at the centers of mass.  The center of mass frame is an inertial frame in which the center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.

[[Rotation group SO(3)]]

CATEGORIES: Lie groups, Rotational symmetry, Rotation in three dimensions, Euclidean solid geometry

In mechanics and geometry, the 3D rotation group is the group of all rotations about the origin of three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 under the operation of composition.Jacobson (2009), p. 34, Ex. 14. By definition, a rotation about the origin is a transformation that preserves the origin, Euclidean distance (so it is an isometry), and orientation (i.e. handedness of space).  A distance-preserving transformation which reverses orientation is an improper rotation, that is a reflection or, in the general position, a rotoreflection. The origin in Euclidean space establishes a one-to-one correspondence between points and their coordinate vectors. Rotations about the origin can be thought of as magnitude-preserving linear transformations of Euclidean 3-dimensional vectors (whose vector space is also denoted as R3).
Composing two rotations results in another rotation; every rotation has a unique inverse rotation; and the identity map satisfies the definition of a rotation. Owing to the above properties (along with the associative property, which rotations obey), the set of all rotations is a group under composition. Moreover, the rotation group has a natural manifold structure for which the group operations are smooth; so it is in fact a Lie group. The rotation group is often denoted SO(3) (or, less ambiguously, SO(3, R)) for reasons explained below.

Candlestick Park (also commonly referred to as Candlestick) is an outdoor sports and entertainment stadium located in San Francisco, California, in the Bayview Heights area. The stadium was originally built as the home of Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants, who played there from 1960 until moving into Pacific Bell Park (since renamed AT&T Park) in 2000. It was also the home field of the San Francisco 49ers of the  National Football League, from 1971 to 2013. The 49ers are scheduled to move to Levi's Stadium (located in Santa Clara, California) currently under construction, at the beginning of the 2014 NFL season.
The stadium is situated at Candlestick Point on the western shore of the San Francisco Bay. Due to its location next to the bay, strong winds often swirl down into the stadium, creating unusual playing conditions. At the time of its construction in the late 1950s, the stadium site was one of the few pieces of land available in the city that was suitable for a sports stadium and had space for the 10,000 parking spaces promised to the Giants.
The surface of the field is natural bluegrass, but for nine seasons the stadium had artificial turf, from 1970 to 1978. A "sliding pit" configuration, with dirt cut-outs only around the bases, was installed in 1971, primarily to keep the dust down from the breezy conditions. Following the 1978 football season, the artificial turf was removed. Natural grass was re-installed before the 1979 baseball season.

Essen ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈɛsən[/tpl]; Latin: Assindia) is a city in the central part of the Ruhr area in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Located on the River Ruhr, its population of approximately 567,000 ([tpl]As of|2012|12|31|lc=y[/tpl]) makes it the 9th-largest city in Germany. For the year 2010, Essen was the European Capital of Culture on behalf of the whole Ruhr area.
Founded around 845 and historically linked to the centuries-old Krupp family iron works, Essen was one of Germany's most important coal and steel centres until the 1970s and attracted workers from all over the country; it was the 5th-largest city in Germany between 1929 and 1988, peaking at over 730,000 inhabitants in 1962. The city has since developed a strong tertiary sector of the economy, so it is sometimes called "desk of the Ruhr area". Essen is home to 13 of the 100 largest German corporations and seat to several of the region's authorities.
In 1958, the city was chosen to serve as the seat to a Roman Catholic diocese (often referred to as Ruhrbistum or diocese of the Ruhr). In early 2003, the universities of Essen and the nearby city of Duisburg (both established in 1972) were merged into the University of Duisburg-Essen with campuses in both cities and a university hospital in Essen.

The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come; Delivered under the Similitude of a Dream is a Christian allegory written by John Bunyan and published in February, 1678. It is regarded as one of the most significant works of religious English literature,"The two parts of The Pilgrim's Progress in reality constitute a whole, and the whole is, without doubt, the most influential religious book ever written in the English language" (Alexander M.

Bunyan began his work while in the Bedfordshire county gaol for violations of the Conventicle Act, which prohibited the holding of religious services outside the auspices of the established Church of England. Early Bunyan scholars like John Brown believed The Pilgrim's Progress was begun in Bunyan's second, shorter imprisonment for six months in 1675,John Brown, John Bunyan: His Life, Times and Work, (1885, revised edition 1928) but more recent scholars like Roger Sharrock believe that it was begun during Bunyan's initial, more lengthy imprisonment from 1660–72 right after he had written his spiritual autobiography, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, edited with an introduction by Roger Sharrock, (Harmondsworth: Penguins Books, Ltd., 1965), 10, 59, 94, 326-27, 375.
The English text comprises 108,260 words and is divided into two parts, each reading as a continuous narrative with no chapter divisions. The first part was completed in 1677 and entered into the stationers' register on 22 December 1677. It was licensed and entered in the "Term Catalogue" on 18 February 1678, which is looked upon as the date of first publication."The copy for the first edition of the First Part of The Pilgrim's Progress was entered in the Stationers' Register on 22 December 1677 ... The book was licensed and entered in the Term Catalogue for the following Hilary Term, 18 February 1678; this date would customarily indicate the time of publication, or only slightly precede it" Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, James Blanton Wharey and Roger Sharrock, eds., Second Edition, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1960), xxi. After the first edition of the first part in 1678, an expanded edition, with additions written after Bunyan was freed, appeared in 1679. The Second Part appeared in 1684. There were eleven editions of the first part in John Bunyan's lifetime, published in successive years from 1678 to 1685 and in 1688, and there were two editions of the second part, published in 1684 and 1686.

[[Symplectic group]]
CATEGORIES: Lie groups, Symplectic geometry

In mathematics, the name symplectic group can refer to two different, but closely related, types of mathematical groups, denoted Sp(2n, F) and Sp(n). The latter is sometimes called the compact symplectic group to distinguish it from the former. Many authors prefer slightly different notations, usually differing by factors of 2. The notation used here is consistent with the size of the matrices used to represent the groups. In Cartan's classification of the simple Lie algebras, the Lie algebra of the complex group Sp(2n, C) is denoted Cn, and Sp(n) is the compact real form of Sp(2n, C).
The name "symplectic group" is due to Hermann Weyl (details) as a replacement for the previous confusing names of (line) complex group and Abelian group, and is the Greek analog of "complex".

[[Uncorrelated]]

CATEGORIES: Covariance and correlation, Statistical terminology

In probability theory and statistics, two real-valued random variables, X,Y, are said to be uncorrelated if their covariance, E(XY) - E(X)E(Y), is zero.  A set of two or more random variables is called uncorrelated if each pair of them are uncorrelated. If two variables are uncorrelated, there is no linear relationship between them.
Uncorrelated random variables have a Pearson correlation coefficient of zero, except in the trivial case when either variable has zero variance (is a constant).  In this case the correlation is undefined.
In general, uncorrelatedness is not the same as orthogonality, except in the special case where either X or Y has an expected value of 0.  In this case, the covariance is the expectation of the product, and X and Y are uncorrelated if and only if E(XY) = 0.
If X and Y are independent, then they are uncorrelated.  However, not all uncorrelated variables are independent.  For example, if X is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed on 1 and Y = X2, then X and Y are uncorrelated even though X determines Y and a particular value of Y can be produced by only one or two values of X.

[[Symplectic matrix]]

CATEGORIES: Matrices, Symplectic geometry

In mathematics, a symplectic matrix is a 2n×2n matrix M with real entries that satisfies the condition
where MT denotes the transpose of M and Ω is a fixed 2n×2n nonsingular, skew-symmetric matrix. This definition can be extended to 2n×2n matrices with entries in other fields, e.g. the complex numbers.
Typically Ω is chosen to be the block matrix
where In is the n×n identity matrix. The matrix Ω has determinant +1 and has an inverse given by Ω−1 = ΩT = −Ω.
Every symplectic matrix has unit determinant, and the 2n×2n symplectic matrices with real entries form a subgroup of the special linear group SL(2n, R) under matrix multiplication, specifically a connected noncompact real Lie group of real dimension [tpl]nowrap|n(2n + 1)[/tpl], the symplectic group Sp(2n, R). The symplectic group can be defined as the set of linear transformations that preserve the symplectic form of a real symplectic vector space.

In mathematics, the unitary group of degree n, denoted U(n), is the group of n × n unitary matrices, with the group operation that of matrix multiplication. The unitary group is a subgroup of the general linear group GL(n, C). Hyperorthogonal group is an archaic name for the unitary group, especially over finite fields. 
In the simple case n = 1, the group U(1) corresponds to the circle group, consisting of all complex numbers with absolute value 1 under multiplication. All the unitary groups contain copies of this group.
The unitary group U(n) is a real Lie group of dimension n2. The Lie algebra of U(n) consists of n × n skew-Hermitian matrices, with the Lie bracket given by the commutator.
The general unitary group (also called the group of unitary similitudes) consists of all matrices A such that A*A is a nonzero multiple of the identity matrix, and is just the product of the unitary group with the group of all positive multiples of the identity matrix.

Taylor was under the patronage of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. He went on to become chaplain in ordinary to King Charles I as a result of Laud's sponsorship. This made him politically suspect when Laud was tried for treason and executed in 1645 by the Puritan parliament during the English Civil War. After the parliamentary victory over the King, he was briefly imprisoned several times.
Eventually, he was allowed to live quietly in Wales, where he became the private chaplain of the Earl of Carbery. At the Restoration, his political star was on the rise, and he was made Bishop of Down and Connor in Ireland. He also became vice-chancellor of the University of Dublin.

[[Special unitary group]]

CATEGORIES: Lie groups

The special unitary group of degree [tpl]math|n[/tpl], denoted [tpl]math|SU(n)[/tpl], is the group of [tpl]math|n×n[/tpl] unitary matrices with determinant 1. The group operation is that of matrix multiplication. The special unitary group is a subgroup of the unitary group [tpl]math|U(n)[/tpl], consisting of all [tpl]math|n×n[/tpl] unitary matrices. As a compact classical group, [tpl]math|U(n)[/tpl] is the group that preserves the standard inner product on [tpl]math|Cn[/tpl]. It is itself a subgroup of the general linear group,  [tpl]math|SU(n) ⊂ U(n) ⊂ GL(n, C)[/tpl].
The [tpl]math|SU(n)[/tpl] groups find wide application in the Standard Model of particle physics, especially [tpl]math|SU(2)[/tpl] in the electroweak interaction and [tpl]math|SU(3)[/tpl] in QCD.[tpl]cite book | author=Halzen, Francis; Martin, Alan | title=Quarks & Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year=1984 | isbn=0-471-88741-2[/tpl]
The simplest case, [tpl]math|SU(1)[/tpl], is the trivial group, having only a single element. The group [tpl]math|SU(2)[/tpl] is isomorphic to the group of quaternions of norm 1, and is thus diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere. Since unit quaternions can be used to represent rotations in 3-dimensional space (up to sign), there is a surjective homomorphism from [tpl]math|SU(2)[/tpl] to the rotation group [tpl]math|SO(3)[/tpl] whose kernel is [tpl]math|{+I, −I[/tpl]}. [tpl]math|SU(2)[/tpl] is also identical to one of symmetry groups of spinors, Spin(3), that enables a spinor presentation of rotations.

My Three Sons is an American situation comedy. The series ran from 1960 to 1965 on ABC, and moved to CBS until its end on August 24, 1972. My Three Sons chronicles the life of a widower and aeronautical engineer named Steven Douglas (Fred MacMurray), raising his three sons. The series also starred William Frawley as the boys' live-in maternal grandfather, Bub. William Demarest replaced Frawley in 1965 due to Frawley's health issues.
The series was a cornerstone of the ABC and CBS lineups in the 1960s. With 380 episodes produced, it is second only to The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet as television's longest running live-action sitcom. Disney producer Bill Walsh often mused on whether the concept of the show was inspired by the movie The Shaggy Dog, as in his view they shared "the same dog, the same kids, and Fred MacMurray".Fred MacMurray: The First Disney Legend

Bohuslav Martinů ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈboɦuslaf ˈmarcɪnuː|lang|Cs-Bohuslav Martinu.ogg[/tpl]; December 8, 1890 – August 28, 1959) was a prolific Czech composer of modern classical music. Martinů wrote 6 symphonies, 15 operas, 14 ballet scores and a large body of orchestral, chamber, vocal and instrumental works. Martinů became a violinist in the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and taught music in his home town. In 1923 Martinů left Czechoslovakia for Paris, and deliberately withdrew from the Romantic style in which he had been trained. In the 1930s he experimented with expressionism and constructivism, and became an admirer of current European technical developments, exemplified by his orchestral works Half-time and La Bagarre. He also adopted jazz idioms, for instance in his Kuchyňské revue ("Kitchen Revue").
In the early 1930s he found his main font for compositional style, the neo-classical as developed by Stravinsky. With this, he expanded to become a prolific composer, composing chamber, orchestral, choral and instrumental works at a fast rate. His use of the piano obbligato became his signature. His Concerto Grosso and the Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano and Timpani are among his best known works from this period. Among his operas, Julietta and The Greek Passion are considered the finest. He is compared with Prokofiev and Bartók in his innovative incorporation of Central European ethnomusicology into his music. He continued to use Bohemian and Moravian folk melodies throughout his oeuvre, usually nursery rhymes—for instance in Otvírání studánek ("The Opening of the Wells").
His symphonic career began when he emigrated to the United States in 1941, fleeing the German invasion of France, to compose his six symphonies, which were performed by all the major US orchestras. Eventually Bohuslav Martinů returned to live in Europe for two years starting in 1953, then was back in New York until returning to Europe for good in May 1956. He died in Switzerland in August 1959.

A tattoo machine is a hand-held device generally used to create a tattoo, a permanent marking of the skin with indelible ink. Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils to move an armature bar up and down. Connected to the armature bar is a barred needle grouping that pushes ink into the skin. Tattoo artists generally use the term "machine", or  even "iron", to refer to their equipment. The word "gun" is often used but many tattoo professionals dislike it. In addition to "coiled" tattoo machine there are also Rotary Tattoo Machines, which are powered by regulated motors rather than electromagnetic coils.

[[Best alternative to a negotiated agreement]]

CATEGORIES: Negotiation, Dispute resolution

[tpl]Refimprove|date=July 2013[/tpl]In negotiation theory, the Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement or BATNA is the course of action that will be taken by a party if the current negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached.  BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator.  A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA.  Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, time value of money and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value, since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations, rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors.
The BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be real and actionable to be of value,Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | Negotiation Experts[tpl]Third-party-inline|date=July 2013[/tpl] however without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating outcomes. Negotiatiors also need to be aware of the other negotiator's BATNA and to identify how it compares to what they are offering.Negotiation, Readings, Exercises and Cases, Roy J. Lewicki[tpl]Full|date=July 2013[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] 
BATNA was developed by negotiation researchers Roger Fisher and William Ury of the Harvard Program on Negotiation (PON), in their series of books on Principled negotiation that started with Getting to YES, unwittingly duplicating the game theory concept of a disagreement point from bargaining problems pioneered by Nobel Laureate John Forbes Nash decades earlier.[tpl]cite book|last=Fisher and Ury|first=Roger and William|title=Getting to YES|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-311875-6|pages=1–170|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143118757?keywords=getting+to+yes+3rd+edition[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|title=Nash Equilibrium and the History of Economic Theory|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/rmyerson/research/jelnash.pdf|work=Nash Equilibrium and the History of Economic Theory|publisher=Journal of Economic Literature|accessdate=1 October 2012[/tpl] Equilibrium theory explains that, if in a group of players, each player has in consideration the other player’s decisions, then no one will benefit from altering their decisions, if the other players haven’t either.[tpl]cite web|last=Hawkins and Steiner|first=Jeff and Neil|title=The Nash Equilibrium Meets Batna|url=http://www.hnlr.org/print/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/257-264.pdf|work=Gamed Therory Varied Uses in ADR|publisher=Harvard University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012[/tpl] For example, Amy and Phil are in Nash Equilibrium if Amy is making the best decision she can, taking into account Phil's decision, and Phil is making the best decision he can, taking into account Amy's decision. Likewise, a group of players are in Nash Equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can, taking into account the decisions of the others.
A ruthless, aggressive and cold blooded negotiation style is the framework approach most people have when it comes to negotiation,[tpl]cite book|last=Nolan-Haley|first=Jaqueline M|title=Alternative Dispute Resolution in a Nutshel|year=2001|publisher=Thomson West|isbn=978-0-314-18014-8 |pages=39–50|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0314180141?keywords=Alternative+Dipute+Resolution[/tpl] a theoretical example of that is Adversarial Approach Style Negotiation. But in reality, as mentioned by experts and researchers such as Fisher and Ury  it doesn’t have to be that way. As the world moves to more sophisticated platforms of communication, negotiation follows the trend and Problem-Solving Approach is in a way, the "antidote" of Adversarial Approach Style Negotiation. Getting to YES  suggest an Interest-Based Model for the use of Problem-Solving Approach. Interest-Based Model focus on separating the person (positional) from the problems' '(resolution) and then concentrate on the resolution. This lets each party attain its goals in a distributive way.
Attractive Alternatives is needed to develop a very strong BATNA. In Getting to YES, the authors give 3 suggestions of how you can accomplish this:
BATNA rules: A BATNA is not disclosed unless it's beneficial.
In negotiations involving different cultures, all parties need to account for cultural cognitive behaviors and not allow judgments and biases to affect the negotiation. The individual should be separate from the objective.[tpl]Page needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The purpose here, as Gulliver mentions, is for negotiation parties to be aware.[tpl]cite book|last=Gulliver|first=P.H|title=Disputes and Negotiation: A Cross Culture Perspective|year=1979|publisher=Academic Press|pages=287[/tpl]

[[Spherical geometry]]
CATEGORIES: Classical geometry, Spherical geometry, Spherical trigonometry, Spherical astronomy

Spherical geometry is the geometry of the two-dimensional surface of a sphere. It is an example of a geometry which is not Euclidean.  Two practical applications of the principles of spherical geometry are to navigation and astronomy.
In plane geometry the basic concepts are points and (straight) lines. On the sphere, points are defined in the usual sense. The equivalents of lines are not defined in the usual sense of "straight line" in Euclidean geometry but in the sense of "the shortest paths between points," which are called geodesics. On the sphere the geodesics are the great circles; other geometric concepts are defined as in plane geometry but with straight lines replaced by great circles. Thus, in spherical geometry angles are defined between great circles, resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects; for example, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle exceeds 180 degrees.
Spherical geometry is not elliptic geometry but shares with that geometry the property that a line has no parallels through a given point.  Contrast this with Euclidean geometry, in which a line has one parallel through a given point, and hyperbolic geometry, in which a line has two parallels and an infinite number of ultraparallels through a given point.
An important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points (pairs of opposite points) on the sphere.  (This is elliptic geometry.)  Locally, the projective plane has all the properties of spherical geometry, but it has different global properties.  In particular, it is non-orientable, or one-sided.
Concepts of spherical geometry may also be applied to the oblong sphere, though minor modifications must be implemented on certain formulas.
Higher-dimensional spherical geometries exist; see elliptic geometry.

[[Western blot]]
CATEGORIES: Protein methods, Molecular biology, Laboratory techniques, Molecular biology techniques

The western blot (sometimes called the protein immunoblot) is a widely used analytical technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample of tissue homogenate or extract. It uses gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide. The proteins are then transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. The gel electrophoresis step is included in Western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.  An improved immunoblot method, Zestern analysis, is able to address this issue without the electrophoresis step, thus significantly improving the efficiency of protein analysis.
There are now many reagent companies that specialize in providing antibodies (both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies) against tens of thousands of different proteins. Commercial antibodies can be expensive, although the unbound antibody can be reused between experiments. This method is used in the fields of molecular biology, biochemistry, immunogenetics and other molecular biology disciplines.
Other related techniques include dot blot analysis, zestern analysis, immunohistochemistry where antibodies are used to detect proteins in tissues and cells by immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The method originated in the laboratory of Harry Towbin at the Friedrich Miescher Institute. The name western blot was given to the technique by W. Neal Burnette  and is a play on the name Southern blot, a technique for DNA detection developed earlier by Edwin Southern. Detection of RNA is termed northern blot and was developed by George Stark at Stanford.

[[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]]

[tpl]Politics of Northern Ireland[/tpl]
Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, informally known as the Northern Ireland Secretary, is the principal secretary of state in Her Majesty's Government with responsibilities for Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State is a Minister of the Crown who is accountable to the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is the chief minister in the Northern Ireland Office. As with other ministers, the position is appointed by the British monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The position is normally described simply as 'the Secretary of State' by residents of Northern Ireland.
Formerly holding a large portfolio over home affairs in Northern Ireland, the current devolution settlement has lessened the Secretary of State's role, granting many of the former powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive. The Secretary of State is now generally limited to representing Northern Ireland in the UK cabinet, overseeing the operation of the devolved administration and a number of reserved and excepted matters which remain the sole competence of the UK Government e.g. security, human rights, certain public inquiries and the administration of elections.http://www.nio.gov.uk/index/about-the-nio.htm
Created in 1972, the position has switched between Members of Parliament from the Conservative Party and Labour Party. As Labour has not fielded candidates in Northern Ireland and the Conservatives have not had candidates elected to Northern Ireland Assembly or for House of Commons seats in the province, those appointed as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have not represented a constituency in Northern Ireland. This contrasts with the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Wales.
The Secretary of State resides in Hillsborough Castle, the previous residence of the Governor and the official government and royal residence in Northern Ireland, and exercises their duties through the Northern Ireland Office.

Per Albin Hansson (28 October 1885 – 6 October 1946), was a Swedish politician, chairman of the Social Democrats from 1925 and two-time Prime Minister in four governments between 1932 and 1946, governing all that period save for a short-lived crisis in the summer of 1936, which he ended by forming a coalition government with his main adversary, Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp. During World War II, in which Sweden maintained a policy of neutrality, he presided over a government of unity that included all major parties in the Riksdag. Forging the Social Democratic grip on Swedish politics that would last throughout the century, Hansson left an astounding legacy on his party as well as creating the "Swedish model" that remains largely intact to date, including a strict policy of neutrality, a wide-stretching welfare state through parliamentary legislation, and reformist social corporatism rather than Marxist nationalization of the means of production. Following the war, Hansson formed a Social Democratic cabinet enjoying absolute majority in the Riksdag before succumbing to a heart attack on his way home from work late at night on 6 October 1946.

[[Asteroid impact avoidance]]

CATEGORIES: Asteroids, Earth, Space weapons, Planetary defense, Impact events

Asteroid impact avoidance comprises a number of methods by which near-Earth objects (NEO) could be diverted, preventing destructive impact events.  A sufficiently large impact by an asteroid or other NEOs would cause, depending on its impact location, massive tsunamis, multiple firestorms and an impact winter caused by the sunlight blocking effect of placing large quantities of pulverized rock dust into the stratosphere. Massive impacts may also cause volcanic mantle pluming at the antipodal point.[tpl]Cite journal| last1 = Hagstrum | first1 = Jonathan T. | title = Antipodal Hotspots and Bipolar Catastrophes: Were Oceanic Large-body Impacts the Cause? | journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume = 236 | pages = 13–27 | year = 2005 | url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Antip_hot.pdf| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2005.02.020 | bibcode=2005E&PSL.236...13H[/tpl] This volcanism, if energetic enough, could compound the effects of the impact by creating a volcanic winter, irrespective of the other impact effects.  
A collision between the Earth and an approximately 10-kilometre-wide object 66 million years ago is believed to have produced the Chicxulub Crater and the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, widely held responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs.
While the chances of a major collision are not great in the near term, there is a high probability that one will happen eventually unless defensive actions are taken. Recent astronomical events—such as the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts on Jupiter and the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor along with the growing number of objects on the Sentry Risk Table—have drawn renewed attention to such threats.

An action figure is a poseable character figurine, made of plastic or other materials, and often based upon characters from a film, comic book, video game, or television program. These action figures are usually marketed towards boys and adult collectors.
It is argued that action figures are particularly popular with boys because they represent traditional masculine traits and are closely associated with the public sphere.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Anders|year=2005|title=Children’s Toy Collections in Sweden—A Less Gender-Typed Country?|journal=Sex Roles|publisher=Springer Science+Business (Jessie Galloway) Media, Inc.|volume=52|issue=1/2[/tpl] While most commonly marketed as a children's toy, the action figure has gained wide acceptance as an adult collector item.

[[Diagonal matrix]]
CATEGORIES: Matrix normal forms, Sparse matrices

In linear algebra, a diagonal matrix is a matrix (usually a square matrix) in which the entries outside the main diagonal (↘) are all zero. The diagonal entries themselves may or may not be zero. Thus, the matrix D = (di,j) with n columns and n rows is diagonal if:
For example, the following matrix is diagonal:
The term diagonal matrix may sometimes refer to a rectangular diagonal matrix, which is an m-by-n matrix with only the entries of the form di,i possibly non-zero. For example:
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 4 & 0& 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & -3& 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}
However, in the remainder of this article we will consider only square matrices. Any square diagonal matrix is also a symmetric matrix. Also, if the entries come from the field R or C, then it is a normal matrix as well. Equivalently, we can define a diagonal matrix as a matrix that is both upper- and lower-triangular. The identity matrix In and any square zero matrix are diagonal. A one-dimensional matrix is always diagonal.

Third-party clients also connect to the service. It communicates using the Microsoft Notification Protocol, a proprietary instant messaging protocol. The service allows anyone with a Microsoft account to sign in and communicate in real time with other people who are signed in as well. In early 2013, Microsoft mostly terminated Messenger service, encouraging users to merge their Messenger accounts into new or existing Skype accounts.[tpl]cite web|last=Bates |first=Tony |url=http://blogs.skype.com/en/2012/11/skypewlm.html |title=Talk to your Messenger Contacts on Skype – - Skype Blogs |publisher=Blogs.skype.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15[/tpl]

[[Indecent exposure]]

CATEGORIES: Nudity, Paraphilias, Crimes, Sex crimes, Sex laws

Indecent exposure is the deliberate exposure in public or in view of the general public by a person of a portion or portions of his or her body, in circumstances where the exposure is contrary to local moral or other standards of appropriate behavior. Social and community attitudes to the exposing of various body parts and laws covering what is referred to as indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from prohibition of exposure of genital areas, buttocks and female breasts. In some conservative countries[tpl]which|date=November 2012[/tpl] the exposure of any part of the female body is considered indecent. Not all countries have indecent exposure laws.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The applicable standard of decency is generally that of the local community, which is sometimes codified in law, but may also be based in religion, morality, or, in some justifications, on the basis of "necessary to public order".[tpl]cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |edition=Tenth |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=2001 |chapter=Indecent exposure |page=589 |isbn=0-87779-713-7 [/tpl] Indecent exposure sometimes refers to exhibitionism or to nudity in public and does not require a sexual act to be performed. If sexual acts are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered public indecency, which may be a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably, and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure itself a complex topic.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

Windows Messenger is a client by Microsoft that is included in the Windows XP operating system. Designed for use by corporate users as well as home users, it was originally created as a streamlined and integrated version of MSN Messenger. After its initial release in 2001, it was later upgraded in 2004, when it was made available for Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003.
Since then, development on Windows Messenger has stopped, with the exception of security updates. It has been superseded by Microsoft's similarly named but separate and newer client, Windows Live Messenger, for connections to the Microsoft Messenger service, and by Microsoft Lync (formerly Microsoft Office Communicator) in corporate environments.
The client is not related to the Windows Messenger service, a Windows service for Windows NT, which was designed for local area networks (LAN).

[[Compiled language]]

CATEGORIES: Programming language classification

A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers (translators which generate machine code from source code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no pre-runtime translation takes place).
The term is somewhat vague; in principle any language can be implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter. A combination of both solutions is also increasingly common: a compiler can translate the source code into some intermediate form (often called bytecode), which is then passed to an interpreter which executes it.

[[Home rule]]

CATEGORIES: Home rule in the United Kingdom, History of Ireland (1801–1923), Indian independence movement, Decentralization, Local government

Home rule is the power of a constituent part (administrative division) of a state to exercise such of the state's powers of governance within its own administrative area that have been decentralised to it by the central government.
In the United Kingdom, it has traditionally referred to self-government, devolution or independence of its constituent nations—initially Ireland, and later Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.  In the United States and other countries organised as federations of states, the term usually refers to the process and mechanisms of self-government as exercised by municipalities, counties, or other units of local government at the level below that of a federal state (e.g., US state, in which context see special legislation).  It can also refer to the similar system under which Greenland and the Faroe Islands are associated with Denmark.
Home rule is not, however, comparable with federalism. Whereas states in a federal system of government (e.g., Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, Brazil and the United States of America) have a guaranteed constitutional existence, a devolved home rule system of government is created by ordinary legislation and can be reformed, or even abolished, by repeal or amendment of that ordinary legislation.
A state legislature may, for example, create home rule for a county or parish (or its townships), so that a county commission or board of supervisors may have jurisdiction over its unincorporated areas, including important issues like zoning.  (Without this, a US county is simply an extension of state government.) The legislature can also establish or eliminate municipal corporations, which have home rule within town or city limits through the city council.  The state government could also abolish counties/townships, or their governments, according to the state constitution and state laws.

The ''abc'' conjecture (also known as Oesterlé–Masser conjecture) is a conjecture in number theory, first proposed by [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink=Joseph  Oesterlé|first=Joseph|last=Oesterlé|year=1988[/tpl] and [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink=David Masser|first=David|last=Masser|year= 1985[/tpl] as an integer analogue of the Mason–Stothers theorem for polynomials. The conjecture is stated in terms of three positive integers, a, b and c (hence the name), which have no common factor and satisfy a + b = c. If d denotes the product of the distinct prime factors of abc, the conjecture essentially states that d is usually not much smaller than c. In other words: if a and b are composed from large powers of primes, then c is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.
The abc conjecture has already become well known for the number of interesting consequences it entails. Many famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the abc conjecture. [tpl]harvtxt|Goldfeld|1996[/tpl] described the abc conjecture as "the most important unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis".
Several solutions have been proposed to the abc conjecture, the most recent of which is still being evaluated by the mathematical community, though it still remains open as of February 2014.

The Conventicle Act of 1664 was an Act of the Parliament of England (16 Charles II c. 4) that forbade conventicles (religious assemblies of more than five people outside the auspices of the Church of England). This law was part of the Clarendon Code, named after Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, which aimed to discourage nonconformism and to strengthen the position of the Established Church. However the Clarendon Code was not actually the work of Clarendon himself, who favoured a policy of greater tolerance towards dissenters.History Learning Site - Clarendon Code These prohibitions led many, such as the Covenanters, to vacate their parishes rather than submit to the new Episcopal authorities. Just as the ministers left so too did the congregations, following their old pastors to sermons on the hillside. From small beginnings these field assemblies-or conventicles-were to grow into major problems of public order for the government.
Other statutes that were part of the Clarendon Code include:
The operation of these laws at least as far as Protestants were concerned was mitigated somewhat by Charles II's Royal Declaration of Indulgence in 1672, which suspended the execution of penal laws and allowed a certain number of non-conformist chapels to be staffed and constructed, with the pastors subject to royal approval.
The Conventicle Act and Five Mile Act were repealed in 1689.
(The '16 Charles II c. 2' nomenclature is reference to the statute book of the numbered year of the reign of the named King in the stated chapter. This is the method used for Acts of Parliament from before 1962.)

[[Serial ATA]]

CATEGORIES: Serial ATA, Serial buses, 2003 introductions, Computer connectors

Serial ATA (SATA) is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives and optical drives. Serial ATA replaces the older AT Attachment standard (later referred to as Parallel ATA or PATA), offering several advantages over the older interface: reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signalling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol.
SATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors. In contrast, parallel ATA (the redesignation for the legacy ATA specifications) used a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals, all operating at much lower frequency. To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications, SATA uses the same basic ATA and ATAPI command-set as legacy ATA devices.
SATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop computers, and has largely replaced PATA in new embedded applications. SATA's market share in the desktop PC market was 99% in 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf |title=Serial ATA: Meeting Storage Needs Today and Tomorrow|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30[/tpl] PATA remains widely used in industrial and embedded applications that use CompactFlash storage, even though the new CFast standard is based on SATA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/25/cfast-compactflash-cards-now-said-to-be-coming-in-18-to-24-mont/|author=Donald Melanson|publisher=Engadget|title=CFast CompactFlash cards now said to be coming in "18 to 24 months"|date=2008-02-25|accessdate=2009-03-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2009/1/9/preteccfaststoragecards|publisher=DPReview|title=Pretec release CFast card with SATA interface|date=8 January 2009|accessdate=19 March 2009[/tpl]
Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from The Serial ATA International Organization (aka SATA-IO). The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates, reviews, ratifies, and publishes the interoperability specifications, the test cases, and plug-fests. As with many other industry compatibility standards, the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies: primarily the INCITS T13 subcommittee ATA, the INCITS T10 subcommittee (SCSI), a subgroup of T10 responsible for Serial Attached SCSI (SAS).

[[Honour]]

CATEGORIES: Honor, Ethics, Social status, Warrior code

[tpl]Use British English|date=January 2011[/tpl][tpl]Use dmy dates|date=January 2011[/tpl]

Honour (also honor in American English; from the Latin word honor) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation.  Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.
Honour can be viewed in the light of Psychological nativism as being as real to the human condition as love, and likewise deriving from the formative personal bonds that establish one's personal dignity and character.  From the point of moral relativism, honour is perceived as arising from universal concerns for material circumstance and status, rather than fundamental differences in principle between those who hold different honour codes.
Dr Samuel Johnson, in his A Dictionary of the English Language (1755), defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was "nobility of soul, magnanimity, and a scorn of meanness."
This sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it.  On the other hand, Johnson also defined honour in relationship to "reputation" and "fame"; to "privileges of rank or birth", and as "respect" of the kind which "places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence." This sort of honour is not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. Finally, with respect to sexuality, honour has traditionally been associated with (or identical to)  "chastity" or "virginity", or in case of married men and women, "fidelity". Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.

The Sarvāstivāda (Sanskrit: सर्वास्तिवाद sarvāstivāda; [tpl]CJKV|t=說一切有部|p=Shuō Yīqièyǒu Bù[/tpl]) were an early school of Buddhism that held to 'the existence of all dharmas in the past, present and future, the 'three times'. Vasubandhu's [tpl]IAST|Abhidharmakośa-bhāṣya[/tpl] states:

The Sarvāstivādins were one of the most influential Buddhist monastic groups, flourishing throughout Northwest India, Northern India, and Central Asia. The Sarvāstivādins are believed to have given rise to the Mūlasarvāstivāda sect, although the relationship between these two groups has not yet been fully determined.

In: Speculum, 23 (1948), pp. 1-34. ([tpl]lang-la|Imperium Romaniae[/tpl]), more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire ([tpl]lang-el|Λατινική Αυτοκρατορία[/tpl]) or Latin Empire of Constantinople, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Roman Empire as titular successor to the Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century.

Almost all of the road has been built to dual carriageway standards.  Apart from brief sections in London the road travels from that city SW and, after Liss, SSW.
Close to its southerly end, traffic for Portsmouth is routed via the A3(M), A27 and M275 — the A3 becomes a single carriageway through some south Hampshire settlements (as exceptionally through Battersea, Clapham and Stockwell towards the northern end).right|thumb|The A3(M) at the Portsdown Hill Road Bridge nearing Junction 5 with the A27right|thumb|Northbound near the Wisley Interchange with the M25

[[Jubilees]]

CATEGORIES: Old Testament Apocrypha, Texts which have been attributed to Moses

The Book of Jubilees, sometimes called Lesser Genesis (Leptogenesis), is an ancient Jewish religious work of 50 chapters, considered canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church as well as Bete Israel (Ethiopian Jews), where it is known as the Book of Division (Ge'ez: Mets'hafe Kufale). Jubilees is considered one of the pseudepigrapha by Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox Churches.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. 
It was well known to Early Christians, as evidenced by the writings of Epiphanius, Justin Martyr, Origen, Diodorus of Tarsus, Isidore of Alexandria, Isidore of Seville, Eutychius of Alexandria, John Malalas, George Syncellus, and George Kedrenos. The text was also utilized by the community that originally collected the Dead Sea Scrolls. It was so thoroughly suppressed in the 4th century that no complete Hebrew, Greek or Latin version has survived. There is conjecture among western biblical scholars that Jubilees may be a rework of material found in the canonical books of Genesis and Exodus.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
The Book of Jubilees claims to present "the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world" as revealed to Moses (in addition to the Torah or "Instruction") by Angels while he was on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights.Book of Jubilees "Jublees 1:4" The chronology given in Jubilees is based on multiples of seven; the jubilees are periods of 49 years, seven 'year-weeks', into which all of time has been divided. According to the author of Jubilees, all proper customs that mankind should follow are determined by God's decree.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

[[Diagenesis]]

CATEGORIES: Geological processes, Fossil fuels, Sedimentology

Diagenesis [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ə|s|ɪ|s[/tpl], literally meaning "two origins", is the change of sediments or existing sedimentary rocks into a different sedimentary rock during and after rock formation (lithification), at temperatures and pressures less than that required for the formation of metamorphic rocks.Marshak, Stephen, 2009, Essentials of Geology, W. W. Norton & Company, 3rd ed. ISBN 978-0393196566 It does not include changes from weathering. It is any chemical, physical, or biological change undergone by a sediment after its initial deposition, after its lithification. This process excludes surface alteration (weathering) and metamorphism. These changes happen at relatively low temperatures and pressures and result in changes to the rock's original mineralogy and texture. There is no sharp boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism, but the latter occurs at higher temperatures and pressures than the former. Hydrothermal solutions, meteoric groundwater, porosity, permeability, solubility, and time are all influential factors.
After deposition, sediments are compacted as they are buried beneath successive layers of sediment and cemented by minerals that precipitate from solution. Grains of sediment, rock fragments and fossils can be replaced by other minerals during diagenesis. Porosity usually decreases during diagenesis, except in rare cases such as dissolution of minerals and dolomitization.
The study of diagenesis in rocks is used to understand the geologic history they have undergone and the nature and type of fluids that have circulated through them. From a commercial standpoint, such studies aid in assessing the likelihood of finding various economically viable mineral and hydrocarbon deposits.
The process of diagenesis is also important in the decomposition of bone tissue.[ref]

[[Isotope analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Isotopes

Isotope analysis is the identification of isotopic signature, the distribution of certain stable isotopes and chemical elements within chemical compounds. This can be applied to a food web to make it possible to draw direct inferences regarding diet, trophic level, and subsistence. Variations in isotope ratios from isotopic fractionation are measured using mass spectrometry, which separates the different isotopes of an element on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio.
The ratios of isotopic oxygen are also differentially affected by global weather patterns and regional topography as moisture is transported. Areas of lower humidity cause the preferential loss of 18O water in the form of vapor and precipitation. Furthermore, evaporated 16O water returns preferentially to the atmospheric system as it evaporates and 18O remains in liquid form or is incorporated into the body water of plants and animals.

Mezzotint is a printmaking process of the intaglio family, technically a drypoint method. It was the first tonal method to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like hatching, cross-hatching or stipple. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening the plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a "rocker." In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.

Linocut is a printmaking technique, a variant of woodcut in which a sheet of linoleum (sometimes mounted on a wooden block) is used for the relief surface. A design is cut into the linoleum surface with a sharp knife, V-shaped chisel or gouge, with the raised (uncarved) areas representing a reversal (mirror image) of the parts to show printed. The linoleum sheet is inked with a roller (called a brayer), and then impressed onto paper or fabric. The actual printing can be done by hand or with a press.

[[Chine-collé]]

CATEGORIES: Printmaking

Chine-collé is a special technique in printmaking, in which the image is transferred to a surface that is bonded to a heavier support in the printing process.  One purpose is to allow the printmaker to print on a much more delicate surface, such as Japanese paper or linen, which pulls finer details off the plate.  Another purpose is to provide a background colour behind the image that is different from the surrounding backing sheet.
The final image will depend on the design and ink color of the printed image, the color and opacity of the paper to which the image is directly printed (plus any inclusions such as petals or fibers in that paper), and the color of the backing sheet.

[[Monotyping]]

CATEGORIES: Printmaking

Monotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass.  The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque colour. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.
Monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype; most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior.
These prints from the original plate are called "ghost prints." A print made by pressing a new print onto another surface, effectively making the print into a plate, is called a "cognate". Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes can be spontaneously executed and with no previous sketch.

Drypoint is a printmaking technique of the intaglio family, in which an image is incised into a plate (or "matrix") with a hard-pointed "needle" of sharp metal or diamond point.  Traditionally the plate was copper, but now acetate, zinc, or plexiglas are also commonly used.  Like etching, drypoint is easier for an artist trained in drawing to master than engraving, as the technique of using the needle is closer to using a pencil than the engraver's burin.

[[Aquatint]]

CATEGORIES: Etching, Printmaking

Aquatint is an intaglio printmaking technique, a variant of etching.  
In intaglio printmaking, the artist makes marks on the matrix (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink.  The inked plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper.  This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.
Like etching, aquatint uses the application of acid to make the marks in the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever color ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect.  The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating.  The tonal variation is controlled by the level of acid exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time. 
Another tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented so that it will carry a fairly dark tone of ink.  The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade.  Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker.  Occasionally these two techniques are combined.

CATEGORIES: Phrases, Promotion and marketing communications, Slogans

A slogan is a memorable motto or phrase used in a political, commercial, religious, and other context as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose. The word slogan is derived from slogorn which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic and Irish sluagh-ghairm tanmay (sluagh "army", "host" + gairm "cry").Merriam-Webster (2003), p. 1174. Irish  Slogans vary from the written and the visual to the chanted and the vulgar. Their simple rhetorical nature usually leaves little room for detail and a chanted slogan may serve more as social expression of unified purpose than as communication to an intended audience.
Marketing slogans are often called taglines in the United States or straplines in the UK. Europeans use the terms baselines, signatures, claims or pay-offs.Timothy R. V. Foster The Art and Science of the Advertising Slogan. adslogans.co.uk

Sir David Alexander Cecil Low (7 April 1891 – 19 September 1963) was a New Zealand political cartoonist and caricaturist who lived and worked in the United Kingdom for many years. Low was a self-taught cartoonist. Born in New Zealand, he worked in his native country before migrating to Sydney, Australia in 1911, and ultimately to London (1919), where he made his career and earned fame for his Colonel Blimp depictions and his merciless satirising the personalities and policies of German dictator Adolf Hitler, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, and other leaders of his times.
Low was born in and educated in New Zealand. His first work was published when he was only 11 years old. His professional career began at The Canterbury Times in 1910. The following year he moved to Australia and worked for the The Bulletin. His work attracted the attention of Henry Cadbury, the part owner of The London Star, and Low moved to London in 1919, working for that paper until 1927, when he moved to The Evening Standard. There he produced his most famous work, chronicling the rise of fascism in the 1930s, the policy of Appeasement, and the conflict of World War II. His stinging depictions of Hitler and Mussolini led to his work being banned in Italy and Germany, and his being named in The Black Book.

Charlie's Angels is an American crime drama television series that aired on ABC from September 1976 to June 1981, producing five seasons and 110 episodes. The series was created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts and was produced by Aaron Spelling. It plots the adventures of three females working in a private detective agency in Los Angeles, California, and initially starred Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett-Majors, and Jaclyn Smith in the leading roles (later additions to the cast included Cheryl Ladd, Shelley Hack, and Tanya Roberts). David Doyle co-starred as a sidekick to the three women and John Forsythe played the voice of their boss, Charlie.
Despite mixed reviews from critics and a reputation for merely being "Jiggle TV," the show enjoyed an astonishing popularity with audiences, and was a top ten hit for its first few seasons. Because later cast changes were not well-received and the public's taste changed, the show concluded a five-year run in the spring of 1981. The series continues to have a cult and pop culture following through syndication, DVD releases, and subsequent film remakes.

[[Pierre Laromiguière]]
CATEGORIES: French philosophers, Members of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques, 1756 births, 1837 deaths

Pierre Laromiguière (3 November 1756 – 12 August 1837) was a French philosopher.
He was born at Livinhac-le-Haut, Rouergue, and died in Paris.  As professor of philosophy at the University of Toulouse, he was unsuccessful and incurred the displeasure of the French parliament by his thesis on the rights of property in connection with taxation. Subsequently he came to Paris, where he was appointed professor of logic in the École Normale and lectured in the Prytanée. In 1799 he was made a member of the Tribunate, and in 1833 of the Academy of Moral and Political Science. In 1793 he published Projet d'éléments de métaphysique, a work characterized by lucidity and excellence of style. He wrote also two Mémoires, read before the Institute, Les Paradoxes de Condillac (1805) and Le cours de philosophie (1815–1818).
Laromiguière's philosophy is a revolt against the extreme physiological psychology of the natural scientists, such as Cabanis. He distinguished between those psychological phenomena which can be traced directly to purely physical causes, and the actions of the soul which originate from within itself. Psychology was not for him a branch of physiology, nor on the other hand did he give to his theory an abstruse metaphysical basis. A pupil of Condillac and indebted for much of his ideology to Antoine Destutt de Tracy, he attached a fuller importance to "attention" as a psychic faculty. Attention provides the facts, Comparison groups and combines them, while Reason systematizes and explains. The soul is active in its choice, i.e. is endowed with freewill, and is, therefore, immortal.
For natural science as a method of discovery he had no respect. He held that its judgments are, at the best, statements of identity, and that its so-called discoveries are merely the reiteration, in a new form, of previous truisms. Laromiguière was not the first to develop these views; he owed much to Condillac, Destutt de Tracy and Cabanis. The accuracy of his language and the purity of his style gave his works great influence, especially over Armand Marrast, Louis Cardaillac and Victor Cousin. A lecture of his in the École Normale impressed Cousin so strongly that he at once devoted himself to the study of philosophy. Jouffroy and Hippolyte Taine agree in describing him as one of the great thinkers of the 19th century.

[[Pierre Jean George Cabanis]]

CATEGORIES: 1757 births, 1808 deaths, People from Corrèze, French scientists, Members of the Académie française, Council of Five Hundred members, Burials at the Panthéon, Paris, Les Neuf Sœurs

Pierre Jean George Cabanis ([tpl]IPA-fr|kabanis|lang[/tpl]; 5 June 1757 – 5 May 1808) was a French physiologist and materialist philosopher.
Cabanis was born at Cosnac (Corrèze), the son of Jean Baptiste Cabanis (1723–1786), a lawyer and agronomist.  At the age of ten, he attended the college of Brives, where he showed great aptitude for study, but his independence of spirit was so great that he was almost constantly in a state of rebellion against his teachers and was finally expelled. He was then taken to Paris by his father and left to carry on his studies at his own discretion for two years. From 1773 to 1775 he travelled in Poland and Germany, and on his return to Paris he devoted himself mainly to poetry. About this time he sent to the Académie française a translation of the passage from Homer proposed for their prize, and, though he did not win, he received so much encouragement from his friends that he contemplated translating the whole of the Iliad.
At his father's wish, he gave up writing and decided to engage in a more settled profession,  selecting medicine. In 1789 his Observations sur les hôpitaux (Observations on hospitals, 1790) procured him an appointment as administrator of hospitals in Paris, and in 1795 he became professor of hygiene at the medical school of Paris, a post which he exchanged for the chair of legal medicine and the history of medicine in 1799.
Partly because of his poor health, he tended not to practise as a physician, his interests lying in the deeper problems of medical and physiological science. During the last two years of Honoré Mirabeau's life, Cabanis was intimately connected with him, and wrote the four papers on public education which were found among the Mirabeau's papers at his death, and were edited by the real author soon afterwards in 1791. During the illness which terminated his life Mirabeau trusted entirely to Cabanis' professional skills. Of the death of Mirabeau, Cabanis drew up a detailed narrative, intended as a justification of his treatment of the case. He was enthusiastic about the French Revolution and became a member of the Council of Five Hundred and then of the conservative senate, and the dissolution of the Directory was the result of a motion which he made to that effect. His political career was brief. Hostile to the policy of Napoleon Bonaparte, he rejected every offer of a place under his government. He died at Meulan.
His body is buried in the Pantheon and his heart in Auteuil Cemetery in Paris.
A complete edition of Cabanis's works was begun in 1825, and five volumes were published. His principal work, Rapports du physique et du moral de l'homme (On the relations between the physical and moral aspects of man, 1802), consists in part of memoirs, read in 1796 and 1797 to the Institute, and is a sketch of physiological psychology. Psychology is with Cabanis directly linked on to biology, for sensibility, the fundamental fact, is the highest grade of life and the lowest of intelligence. All the intellectual processes are evolved from sensibility, and sensibility itself is a property of the nervous system. The soul is not an entity, but a faculty; thought is the function of the brain. Just as the stomach and intestines receive food and digest it, so the brain receives impressions, digests them, and has as its organic secretion, thought.
Alongside this materialism, Cabanis held another principle. He belonged in biology to the vitalistic school of GE Stahl, and in the posthumous work, Lettre sur les causes premières (1824), the consequences of this opinion became clear. Life is something added to the organism: over and above the universally diffused sensibility there is some living and productive power to which we give the name of Nature. It is impossible to avoid ascribing both intelligence and will to this power. This living power constitutes the ego, which is truly immaterial and immortal. Cabanis did not think that these results were out of harmony with his earlier theory.
He was a member of the masonic lodge Les Neuf Sœurs.

It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic. Peter I Island is [tpl]convert|11|by|19|km[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|156|km2[/tpl]. The tallest peak is the ultra and [tpl]convert|1640|m|adj=on|sp=us[/tpl] tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals.
The island was first sighted by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on 21 January 1821 and was named for Peter I of Russia. Not until 2 February 1929 did anyone set foot on the island, when Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad's Second Norvegia Expedition, financed by Lars Christensen, was successful. They claimed it for Norway, who annexed it in 1931 and made it a dependency in 1933. The next landing occurred in 1948 and the island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism. The island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty in 1961. Since 1987, there has been an automated meteorological station on the island. Three DX-peditions have visited the island and there are sporadic landings by tourists.

Sir James Chadwick  [tpl]post-nominals|country=GBR|CH|FRS[/tpl] (20 October 1891 – 24 July 1974) was an English physicist who was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of the neutron in 1932. He wrote the final draft of the MAUD Report, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious atomic bomb research efforts. He was the head of the British scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He was knighted in England in November 1945 for achievements in physics.
A graduate of the University of Manchester, where he studied under  Ernest Rutherford, also known as the father of nuclear physics. Chadwick was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and elected to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a continuous electromagnetic spectrum, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when World War I broke out in Europe, he spent the war in the Ruhleben internment camp.
After the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was Rutherford's Assistant Director of Research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. In 1932, Chadwick pursued a line of research that led to his discovery of the neutron. He went on to measure its mass. He looked forward to research about his neutron becoming a major weapon in the fight against cancer. 
Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics. During the Second World War, he carried out research as part of the Tube Alloys project to build an atomic bomb. He is said to have been the physicist most responsible for "Churchill's Bomb". In the summer of 1941, he wrote the final draft of the MAUD Report, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious atomic bomb research efforts. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became head of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Years Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, Chadwick became the Master of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1948. He retired in 1959.

Antonio Junius Jackson, best known as Tony Jackson (October 25, 1882 - April 20, 1921) was an American pianist, singer, and composer.
Jackson was born to a poor African American family in Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana on October 25, 1882. While some sources claim birth dates back to 1876, and a June 5 date, this was likely an error made by his sister Louvina in a later interview, when she appears to have quoted her own birth information. Tony did not appear in the 1880 Federal census unlike his older sisters.1880 Federal census for the family of Antonio Jackson and Rachel (Dennis) Jackson taken in New Orleans, Orleans, Louisiana. He was born a twin, along with Prince Albert Jackson, who died in New Orleans on January 5, 1884,New Orleans, Louisiana, city death records 1804-1949, 5 January, 1884, as available on Ancestry.com at  at fourteen months of age, further reinforcing the October 1882 birth date as correct.

An image of this document is available on the Dr. Jazz website at http://www.doctorjazz.co.uk/tjjdraftf.jpg
Tony showed musical talents at a young age. At about the age of 10 he reportedly constructed a type of crude but working and properly tuned harpsichord out of junk in his back yard, since his family lacked the money to buy or rent a piano. On this contraption young Tony was able to reproduce hymns he heard in church; news of this accomplishment soon spread around the neighborhood and he was offered use of neighbors' pianos and reed organs to practice on.
Jackson got his first musical job at age 13, when he began playing piano during off hours at a Tonk run by bandleader Adam Olivier. By age 15 was already considered by many musicians the best pianist in town.
Jackson became the most popular and sought after entertainer in Storyville. He was said to be able to remember and play any tune he had heard once, and was hardly ever stumped by obscure requests.  His repertory included ragtime, cakewalks (one of his show stopping tricks was to dance a high kicking cakewalk while playing the piano), popular songs of the day from the United States and various nations of Europe and Latin America, blues, and light classics.
His singing voice was also exceptional, and he was said to be able to sing operatic parts from baritone to soprano range.  Fellow musicians and singers were universal in their praise of Jackson, most calling him "the greatest", and even the far-from-modest Jelly Roll Morton ranked Jackson as the only musician better than Morton himself. Jackson also wrote many original tunes, a number of which he sold rights to for a few dollars or were simply stolen from him; some of the old time New Orleans musicians said that some well known Tin Pan Alley pop tunes of the era were actually written by Jackson.
Clarence Williams noted "He was great because he was original in all his improvisations . . . We all copied him."  More than Jackson's music was copied.
Jackson dressed himself with a pearl gray derby, checkered vest, ascot tie with a diamond stickpin, with sleeve garters on his arms to hold up his cuffs as he played.  This became a standard outfit for ragtime and barrelhouse pianists; as one commented "If you can't play like Tony Jackson, at least you can look like him".Rose, Al (1978) Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District, University of Alabama Press. ISBN 0-8173-4403-9
Jackson moved to Chicago in 1912. One of the few tunes published with Jackson's name on it, "Pretty Baby" came out in 1916, although he was remembered performing the song before he left New Orleans. The original lyrics of "Pretty Baby" were said to refer to his male lover of the time.[tpl]Cite journal | title=Gay New Orleans 101 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cWQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=tony+jackson+lgbt#v=onepage&q=tony%20jackson%20lgbt&f=false | work=The Advocate | page=50 | date=2005-10-11 | accessdate=2011-02-02[/tpl] Jackson was resident performer at the De Luxe and Pekin Cafes in Chicago, although in his later years his voice and dexterity were impaired by disease. Although it has been cited by some as  syphilis, the diagnosis at the time of his death was the more likely cirrhosis of the liver which had been progressing for years, in addition to chronic epilepsy.Chicago, Illinois, death records as available on FamilySearch.com He died in Chicago on April 20, 1921.Carr, Ian, et al. (2004).  The Rough Guide to Jazz, p. 396. Rough Guides. ISBN 1-84353-256-5.
Jackson never recorded, but portions of his style are no doubt to be found in the recordings of younger musicians he influenced, like Jelly Roll Morton, Clarence Williams, and Steve Lewis.
In September 2011, The Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame announced that Jackson will be inducted into the hall in a ceremony on November 9. Jackson is being honored for his musical contributions and for living "as an openly gay man when that was rare".Chicago G/L Hall of Fame inducts 11 people and 4 groups

[[Théodore Simon Jouffroy]]

CATEGORIES: French philosophers, 1796 births, 1842 deaths

Théodore Simon Jouffroy (6 July 1796 – 4 February 1842) was a French philosopher.
He was born at Les Pontets, Franche-Comté, département of Doubs. In his tenth year, his father, a tax-gatherer, sent him to an uncle at Pontarlier, under whom he began his classical studies. At Dijon his compositions attracted the attention of an inspector, who had him placed (1814) in the normal school, Paris. There he came under the influence of Victor Cousin, and in 1817 he was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the normal and Bourbon schools.
Three years later, being thrown upon his own resources, he began a course of lectures in his own house, and formed literary connexions with Le Courrier français, Le Globe, L'Encyclopédie moderne, and La Revue européenne. The variety of his pursuits at this time carried him over the whole field of ancient and modern literature. But he was chiefly attracted to the philosophical system represented by Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. The application of "common sense" to the problem of substance supplied a more satisfactory analytic for him than the scepticism of David Hume which reached him through a study of Kant.
He thus threw in his lot with the Scottish philosophy, and his first dissertations are adaptations from Reid's Inquiry. In 1826 he wrote a preface to a translation of Stewart's Moral Philosophy, demonstrating the possibility of a scientific statement of the laws of consciousness; in 1828 he began a translation of the works of Reid, and in his preface estimated the influence of Scottish criticism upon philosophy, giving a biographical account of the movement from Francis Hutcheson onwards.  In the following year he was returned to parlement by the arrondissement of Pontarlier; but the work of legislation was ill-suited to him. Yet he attended to his duties conscientiously, and ultimately broke his health in their discharge. In 1833 he was appointed professor of Greek and Roman philosophy at the college of France and a member of the Academy of Sciences; he then published the Mélanges philosophiques (4th ed. 1866; Eng. trans. G Ripley, Boston, 1835 and 1838), a collection of fugitive papers in criticism and philosophy and history. In them is foreshadowed all that he afterwards worked out in metaphysics, psychology, ethics and aesthetics.
He had already demonstrated, in his prefaces, the possibility of a psychology apart from physiology, of a science of the phenomena of consciousness distinct from the perceptions of sense. He now classified the mental faculties, premising that they must not be confounded with capacities or properties of mind. They were, according to his analysis, personal will, primitive instincts, voluntary movement, natural and artificial signs, sensibility and the faculties of intellect; on this analytic he founded his scheme of the universe.
In 1835 he published Cours de droit naturel (4th ed. 1866), one of his most important works. From the conception of a universal order in the universe he reasons to a Supreme Being, who has created it and who has conferred upon every man in harmony with it the aim of his existence, leading to his highest good. Good, he says, is the fulfilment of man's destiny, evil the thwarting of it. Every man being organized in a particular way has, of necessity, an aim, the fulfilment of which is good; and he has faculties for accomplishing it, directed by reason. The aim is good, however, only when reason guides it for the benefit of the majority, but that is not absolute good. When reason rises to the conception of universal order, when actions are submitted, by the exercise of a sympathy working necessarily and intuitively to the idea of the universal order, the good has been reached, the true good, good in itself, absolute good. But he does not follow his idea into the details of human duty, though he passes in review fatalism, mysticism, pantheism, scepticism, egotism, sentimentalism and rationalism.
In 1835 Jouffroy's health failed and he went to Italy, where he continued to translate the Scottish philosophers. On his return he became librarian to the university, and took the chair of recent philosophy at the faculty of letters. He died in Paris. After his death were published Nouveaux mélanges philosophiques (3rd ed. 1872) and Cours d'esthetique (3rd ed. 1875). The former contributed nothing new to the system except a more emphatic statement of the distinction between psychology and physiology. The latter formulated his theory of beauty.
Jouffroy's claim to distinction rests mainly on his ability as an expositor of other men's ideas. His enthusiasm, and his command over the language of popular exposition, made him a great international medium for the transfusion of ideas. He stood between Scotland and France and Germany and France; and, though his expositions are vitiated by loose reading of the philosophers he interpreted, he did some memorable work.

One of the reasons that bribery is regarded as a notorious evil is that it contributes to a culture of political corruption in which the public trust is eroded. Other issues related to political corruption or betrayal of public trust are lobbying, special interest groups and the public cartel.

A root name server is a name server for the  root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet. It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain (TLD). The root name servers are a critical part of the Internet infrastructure because they are the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts.
A combination of limits in the DNS and certain protocols, namely the practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, resulted in a decision to limit the number of root servers to thirteen server addresses. The use of anycast addressing permits the actual number of root server instances to be much larger, and is 386 [tpl]as of|2014|01|25|lc=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.root-servers.org/|title= www.root-servers.org|accessdate=2014-01-25[/tpl]

Stratovarius is a Finnish power metal band that formed in 1984. Since their formation (originally as Black Water), they have released 15 studio albums, 3 DVD and 3 live albums. Along with German bands Helloween, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Stratovarius is considered one of the leading and most influential groups of the power metal genre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metalfromfinland.com/Stratovarius |title=Stratovarius at Metal from Finland |publisher=Metalfromfinland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.search.com/reference/Stratovarius |title=Reference for Stratovarius |publisher=Search.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/artist/stratovarius |title=Stratovarius Magazine - News, Reviews, Albums and Videos |publisher=Idiomag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15[/tpl] In its history, the band has known many chaotic lineup changes; there is no founding members in the band since 1995, and currently, the longest standing member is singer Timo Kotipelto, who joined in 1994.
Stratovarius was founded as Black Water in August 1984 by singer and drummer Tuomo Lassila, guitarist Staffan Stråhlman, and bassist John Vihervä. Line-up changes soon started to occur, including Timo Tolkki replacing Stråhlman two months later and taking over singing duties as well, and the band expanding to a quintet with the arrival of keyboarist Antti Ikonen the following year. Under this line-up, the band released its first album Fright Night in 1989, with Tolkki acting as sole composer. While various changes of bassist occurred, the band released the albums Twilight Time (1992) and Dreamspace (1994). In 1994, Tolkki decided to stop acting as lead vocalist, with Timo Kotipelto joining the band. After the release of Fourth Dimension in 1995, last remaining founding member Lassila, as well as Ikonen, left the band and were respectively replaced by Jörg Michael and Jens Johansson respectively.
This line-up consiting of Kotipelto, Tolkki, bassist Jari Kainulainen, Johansson and Michael, now recognized as the "classic line-up" of Stratovarius, became the longest line-up in its history (1995-2005). With this line-up, the band released eight albums including most of their popular works (releasing an album with the same line-up than its predecessor for the first time) until the release of a self-titled album in 2005, after which Kanulainen departed and was replaced by Lauri Porra. In 2008 guitarist, sole composer and main lyricist Timo Tolkki, being highly critical of their last album and tired of the tensions between the members, decided to disband Stratovarius. However, at the demand of the rest of the band, he agreed to let them continue as Stratovarius while leaving the band. He subsequently regreted his decision, stating that the current band had nothing to do with Stratovarius which he considered as mainly his own work.
Despite the controversy of Tolkki's departure, the band's following albums Polaris (2009) and Elysium (2011), the first albums with Porra and new guitarist Matias Kupiainen in which all members except Michael were part of the songwriting process, received positive reception, with various critics and fans considering it their best albums in the last decade. After a small "Farewell Jörg" tour in Finland, Jörg Michael departed for personal reasons in 2012. With new drummer Rolf Pilve, the band released its latest album Nemesis in 2013.

[[Whitewater controversy]]
CATEGORIES: Whitewater controversy, Clinton administration controversies

The Whitewater controversy (also called the Whitewater scandal, or simply Whitewater) began with investigations into the real estate investments of Bill and Hillary Clinton and their associates, Jim and Susan McDougal in the Whitewater Development Corporation, a failed business venture in the 1970s and 1980s.
A New York Times article written in March 1992, during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, reported that the Clintons had invested and lost money in the Whitewater development project.Jeff Gerth, "Clintons Joined S.& L. Operator In an Ozark Real-Estate Venture", March 8, 1992. Accessed April 30, 2007. The article stimulated the interest of L. Jean Lewis, a Resolution Trust Corporation investigator who was looking into the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, owned by McDougal. She looked for connections between the savings and loan company and the Clintons, and on September 2, 1992, she submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the Madison Guaranty case. Little Rock U.S. Attorney Charles A. Banks and the FBI determined that the referral lacked merit, but she continued to pursue it. Between 1992 and 1994 she issued several additional referrals against the Clintons and repeatedly called the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock and the Justice Department about the case.[tpl]cite book|last=Williams|first=Robert|title=Political Scandals in the USA|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=drwDdakx57cC&pg=PA65&dq=%22L.+Jean+Lewis%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-zadUcXHJ7a84AO05YHYCg&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22L.%20Jean%20Lewis%22&f=false|year=1998|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|isbn=1-57958-039-4|page=65[/tpl] Her referrals eventually became public knowledge, and she testified before the Senate Whitewater Committee in 1994.
David Hale, the source of criminal allegations against President Clinton in the Whitewater affair, claimed in November 1993 that Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal.Jonathan Broder and Murray Waas, "The road to Hale", Salon.com, March 17, 1998. Accessed November 28, 2012. Clinton supporters regarded Hale's allegations as questionable, as Hale had not mentioned Clinton in reference to this loan during the original FBI investigation of Madison Guaranty in 1989. Only after coming under indictment for this in 1993 did Hale make allegations against the Clintons.Murray Waas, "The story Starr did not want to hear", Salon.com, August 17, 1998. Accessed August 25, 2007.
A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation did result in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never prosecuted, as three separate inquiries found insufficient evidence linking them with the criminal conduct of others related to the land deal."Ray: Insufficient evidence to prosecute Clintons in Whitewater probe", CNN, September 20, 2000. Accessed April 30, 2007. Bill Clinton's successor as Arkansas Governor, Jim Guy Tucker, was also convicted and served time in prison for his role in the fraud. Susan McDougal later served 18 months in prison for contempt of court for refusing to answer any questions relating to Whitewater, and was later granted a pardon by President Clinton just before leaving office.
The term Whitewater is also sometimes used to include other controversies from the Bill Clinton administration, especially those such as Travelgate, Filegate, and the circumstances surrounding Vince Foster's death, that were investigated by the Whitewater Independent Counsel.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/timeline.htm | title=Whitewater Time Line | publisher=The Washington Post | accessdate=2008-01-28 | date=August 26, 1999[/tpl]

[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]

CATEGORIES: 1650s books, Books about Christianity, Christianity and death

Holy Living and Holy Dying is the collective title of two books of Christian devotion by Jeremy Taylor.  They were originally published as The Rules and Exercises of Holy Living, 1650 and The Rules and Exercises of Holy Dying, 1651.
The two books represent one of the high points of English prose during the period of the early Stuarts. According to historian Nancy Lee Beaty (1970, The Craft of Dying: A Study in the Literary Tradition of the Ars Moriendi in England), Holy Dying was the "artistic climax" of a consolatory death literature tradition that had begun with Ars moriendi in the 15th century. Other works in this tradition include The Waye of Dying Well and The Sick Mannes Salve.
Holy Living is designed to instruct the reader in living a virtuous life, increasing personal piety, and avoiding temptations.  Holy Dying is meant to instruct the reader in the "means and instruments" of preparing for a blessed death. Each book contains discussions of theology, moral instruction, often prefaced as "The Consideration reduc'd to practise," and model prayers requesting divine assistance in achieving them.
Holy Living is largely concerned with questions of practical morality, of a type that has hardly changed from the 17th century to today.  The companion volume, Holy Dying, was occasioned by the death of the wife of Taylor's patron and employer, the Earl of Carbery.  That book is half Christian instruction and half memorial sermon, with Taylor displaying his gift for poetic prose.  Coupled with the 17th century cult of melancholia, the result is prose that is simultaneously stately and rapturous, "half in love with easeful death", and reads like prose poetry:
Taylor's work was much admired by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, for its devotional quality; and by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas de Quincey, and Edmund Gosse for its literary qualities.

[[Unicycle trials]]

CATEGORIES: Unicycling

Unicycle trials is a form of unicycling which involves participants attempting to ride a unicycle over obstacles without any part of the rider touching the ground.
IUF Unicycle Trials Regulations for UNICON X
The obstacles traversed can be set up specifically for the purpose of unicycle trials, but are often walls, railings, ledges and other "street furniture" found in an urban environment. The sport is derived from (or at least inspired by) bike trials and motorcycle trials.
Obstacles are traversed using various moves.  Hopping is achieved by suddenly forcing the unicycle pedals downwards while holding the seat, the reactive forces resulting from the compression of the tyre lift the unicycle into the air.  Jumping is a similar to hopping, except that the unicycle seat is held in front of the rider to allow greater height to be achieved.  Pedal grabs and crank grabs involve a hop or jump to land the unicycles pedal or crank on the edge of an object, and then a second hop or jump to land the unicycle fully on the object.
Although unicycle trials can be performed on a standard unicycle, many are not designed for the forces which are caused by unicycle trials.  A trials unicycle is built with unicycle trials in mind, and is therefore designed to better cope with these stresses.

The Lewinsky scandal was a political sex scandal emerging in 1998, from a sexual relationship between United States President Bill Clinton and a 22-year-old White House Intern, Monica Lewinsky. The news of this extra-marital affair and the resulting investigation eventually led to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives and his subsequent acquittal on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial.[tpl]cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard A,|title=An Affair of State The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/posner-affair.html|accessdate=March 1, 2012|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00080-3|chapter=Introduction[/tpl]
In 1995, Lewinsky, a graduate of Lewis & Clark College, was hired to work as an intern at the White House during Clinton's first term, and began a personal relationship with him, the details of which she later confided to her friend and Defense Department co-worker Linda Tripp, who secretly recorded their telephone conversations.[tpl]cite news |title=Tripp: I Am Not Intimidated |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/07/archive/main13349.shtml |date=July 7, 1998 |accessdate=January 26, 2010 |publisher=CBS |quote=In January, Tripp gave Starr the tapes.

[[Bohr radius]]

CATEGORIES: Units of length, Atomic physics, Physical constants

The Bohr radius is a physical constant, approximately equal to the most probable distance between the proton and electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. It is named after Niels Bohr, due to its role in the Bohr model of an atom. In SI units the Bohr radius is:David J. Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Prentice-Hall, 1995, p. 137. ISBN 0-13-124405-1
where:
In Gaussian units the Bohr radius is simply
According to 2010 CODATA the Bohr radius has a value of 5.2917721092(17)[tpl]e|−11[/tpl] m (i.e., approximately 53 pm or 0.53 angstroms).[tpl]cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bohrrada0 |title=CODATA Value: Bohr radius |author= |work=Fundamental Physical Constants |publisher=NIST |accessdate=3 July 2011[/tpl]The number in parenthesis (36) denotes the uncertainty of the last digits.
In the Bohr model of the structure of an atom, put forward by Niels Bohr in 1913, electrons orbit a central nucleus. The model says that the electrons orbit only at certain distances from the nucleus, depending on their energy.  In the simplest atom, hydrogen, a single electron orbits the nucleus and its smallest possible orbit, with lowest energy, has an orbital radius almost equal to the Bohr radius. (It is not exactly the Bohr radius due to the reduced mass effect. They differ by about 0.1%.)
Although the Bohr model is no longer in use, the Bohr radius remains very useful in atomic physics calculations, due in part to its simple relationship with other fundamental constants. (This is why it is defined using the true electron mass rather than the reduced mass, as mentioned above.) For example, it is the unit of length in atomic units.
According to the modern, quantum-mechanical understanding of the hydrogen atom, the average distance −its expectation value− between electron and proton is ≈1.5a0,Modern physics, by Serway, Moses, Moyer, Example 8.9, p284 The value 1.5a0 is approximate, not exact, because it neglects reduced mass, fine structure effects (such as relativistic corrections), and other such small effects. somewhat different than the value in the Bohr model (≈a0), but certainly the same order of magnitude.
The Compton wavelength is about 20 times smaller than the Bohr radius, and the classical electron radius is about 1000 times smaller than the Compton wavelength.

[[Computer addiction]]

CATEGORIES: Behavioral addiction

Computer addiction can be described as the excessive or compulsive use of the computer which persists despite serious negative consequences for personal, social or occupational function. Another clear conceptualization is made by Block who stated that "Conceptually, the diagnosis is a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and/or offline computer usage and consists of at least three subtypes: excessive gaming, sexual preoccupations, and e-mail/text messaging".[tpl]cite journal|last=Block|first=J.

The term offline Computer Addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can both be practiced offline and online.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lemmens|first=Jeroen S.|coauthors=Valkenburg, Patti M.; Peter, Jochen|title=Development and Validation of a Game Addiction Scale for Adolescents|journal=Media Psychology|date=26 February 2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=77–95|doi=10.1080/15213260802669458[/tpl] Online computer Addiction is also known as Internet addiction and gets in general more attention from scientific research than Offline Computer Addiction, mainly because most cases of Computer Addiction are related to the excessive use of the internet.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pies|first=R|title=Should DSM-V Designate "Internet Addiction" a Mental Disorder?|journal=Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=2|pages=31–37[/tpl]
Although addiction is usually used to describe substances, addiction can also be used to describe pathological Internet use. Experts on Internet addiction have described this syndrome as an individual being intensely working on the Internet, prolonged use of the Internet, uncontrollable use of the Internet, unable to use the Internet with efficient time, not being interested in the outside world, not spending time with people from the outside world, and an increase in their loneliness and dejection.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yellowlees|first=Peter|author2=Marks|title=Problematic Internet use or Internet addiction?|journal=ScienceDirect|date=May 2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=1447–1453|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563205000439|accessdate=13 February 2014[/tpl]  However, not all people who spend hours each day on the computer are considered addicted. There are many uses for computers and the internet and in many cases, an individual may spend 6 or more hours in a day on the computer but still not be considered an addict. Each individual situation is different and therefore, there is no set number of hours that is (or is not) considered a potential for computer addiction.[tpl]cite web|title=Computer Addiction|url=http://www.addictions.com/computer/|publisher=ADDICTIONS.COM|accessdate=5 December 2013[/tpl]

[[Goodbye, Columbus]]
CATEGORIES: 1959 short story collections, American short story collections, Novels set in New Jersey, Novellas, National Book Award for Fiction winning works, Books by Philip Roth, Jewish American short story collections

Goodbye, Columbus is a 1959 collection of fiction by the American novelist Philip Roth, comprising the title novella "Goodbye, Columbus"—which first appeared in The Paris Review—and five short stories. It was his first book published, by Houghton Mifflin.
In addition to the title novella, set in New Jersey, Goodbye, Columbus contains the five short stories "The Conversion of the Jews," "Defender of the Faith," "Epstein," "You Can't Tell a Man by the Song He Sings," and "Eli, the Fanatic." Each story deals with the concerns of second and third-generation assimilated American Jews as they leave the ethnic ghettos of their parents and grandparents and go on to college, to white-collar professions, and to  life in the suburbs.
The book was a critical success for Roth and won the 1960 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction[ref]

That earned his name as an up-and-coming young writer.  The book was not without controversy, as people within the Jewish community took issue with Roth's less than flattering portrayal of some characters.Zucker, David J.  "Roth, Rushdie, and rage: religious reactions to Portnoy and The Verses." BNET.  2008.  17 July 2010. The short story Defender of the Faith, about a Jewish sergeant who is exploited by three shirking, coreligionist draftees, drew particular ire.  When Roth in 1962 appeared on a panel alongside the distinguished black novelist Ralph Ellison to discuss minority representation in literature, the questions directed at him became denunciations.Kapkan, Justin (September 25, 1988). "Play It Again, Nathan". The New York Times.

[[Birefringence]]

CATEGORIES: Polarization (waves), Optical mineralogy

Birefringence is the optical property of a material having a refractive index that depends on the polarization and propagation direction of light.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympusmicro.com/primer/lightandcolor/birefringence.html |title = Olympus Microscopy Resource Center |publisher=Olympus America Inc. |accessdate=2011-11-13[/tpl] These optically anisotropic materials are said to be birefringent (or birefractive). The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between refractive indices exhibited by the material. Crystals with asymmetric crystal structures are often birefringent, as well as plastics under mechanical stress. 
Birefringence is responsible for the phenomenon of double refraction whereby a ray of light, when incident upon a birefringent material, is split by polarization into two rays taking slightly different paths. This effect was first described by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 1669, who observed itErasmus Bartholin, Experimenta crystalli islandici disdiaclastici quibus mira & infolita refractio detegitur on birefringent Icelandic crystal through which is detected a remarkable and unique refraction (Copenhagen, Denmark: Daniel Paulli, 1669). See also: Erasmus Bartholin (January 1, 1670) "An account of sundry experiments made and communicated by that learn'd mathematician, Dr. Erasmus Bartholin, upon a chrystal-like body, sent to him out of Island," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, vol. 5, pages 2039-2048.  in calcite, a crystal having one of the strongest birefringences. However it was not until the 19th century that Augustin-Jean Fresnel correctly described the phenomenon in terms of polarization, understanding light as a wave with field components in transverse polarizations (perpendicular to the direction of the wave vector).

CATEGORIES: Jazz musicians from New Orleans, Louisiana, African-American musicians, American jazz composers, American jazz pianists, 1896 births, 1941 deaths

Steve Lewis (March 19, 1896 - c 1941?) was a jazz pianist and composer.
Lewis was born in New Orleans.  He was influenced by the piano stylings of Tony Jackson and Jelly Roll Morton, and became the premier pianist in Storyville after those two older musicians left town.  When the District was closed down in 1917 he went on tour with Billy & Mary Mack's Merrymakers Review. He returned to New Orleans the following year and joined Armand J. Piron's Orchestra.
Lewis was an eccentric character. He drove a Ford Model T which he had custom painted in bright multicolored polka-dots. He played the piano without using either of his middle fingers; these he kept extended straight while playing (in the manner of the rude gesture known as Shooting the Bird).
Lewis taught piano; Luis Russell was one of his students.
Lewis recorded with the Piron Orchestra, some accompanyments for singer New Orleans Willie Jackson, and a single piano roll.  Those well familiar with his music first hand have said that these recordings are an inadequate sample of Lewis' range and talent.
Lewis started showing signs of mental illness, left Piron's band in 1938, was committed to an insane asylum in 1940, and was said to have died there soon after.

Armand John "A.J." Piron (August 16, 1888 – February 17, 1943) was an American jazz violinist, band leader, and composer.
In 1915, Piron and Williams together started the Piron and Williams Publishing Company, and in their first year of business published Piron's composition, “I Wish That I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate”, which became his biggest hit. After touring briefly with W.C. Handy in 1917, he started an orchestra under his own name, which soon included such notables as Lorenzo Tio and Steve Lewis.  Piron's New Orleans Orchestra quickly became the best paid African American band in New Orleans, for Piron landed regular jobs at both the Spanish Fort amusement park and the exclusive white New Orleans Country Club.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
In 1923, Piron took his band to New York City as part of his ambition to make the group nationally known. He succeeded in making a hit there, landing a residency at the Roseland Ballroom, and making recordings for three different companies, Okeh, Victor and Columbia. The influence of Piron's band on the New York scene can be  heard in the records of other New York bands of that time, such as Fletcher Henderson's (although Piron's influence on New York music would be eclipsed a year later when Louis Armstrong arrived in the city). In early 1924, some of Piron's band members were finding the cold northern winter and unfamiliar food and culture objectionable. Piron put the matter to a vote and, to Piron's frustration, the majority of the band voted to return home.
Back in New Orleans, he again lined up good jobs, returning to the Country Club, playing at Tranchina's Restaurant and on the excursion steamships Capital and President into the 1930s; in about 1935, he decided to dramatically change the sound of his orchestra to swing, in line with popular taste.

It is also known as GFK (for [tpl]Lang-de|Glasfaserverstärkter Kunststoff[/tpl]).
Fiberglass is a lightweight, extremely strong and robust material, and is used for many products. Although its strength properties are somewhat lower than carbon fiber and it is less stiff, fiberglass is typically far less brittle, and its raw materials much less expensive. Its bulk strength and weight properties are also very favorable when compared to metals, and it can be easily formed using molding processes.
The plastic matrix may be a thermosetting plastic (most often epoxy, polyester or vinylester) or thermoplastic.
Common uses of fiberglass include high performance aircraft (gliders), boats, automobiles, bath tubs and enclosures, hot tubs, septic tanks, water tanks, roofing, pipes, cladding, casts, surfboards and external door skins.

Concern for animal welfare is often based on the belief that non-human animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering, especially when they are under the care of humans.[tpl]cite web |url=http://media.animalsmatter.org/media/resources/en/en_draft.pdf |title=Draft of the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare |publisher=media.animalmatter.org [/tpl] These concerns can include how animals are slaughtered for food, how they are used in scientific research, how they are kept (as pets, in zoos, farms, circuses, etc.), and how human activities affect the welfare and survival of wild species.
Animal welfare was a concern of some ancient civilizations but began to take a larger place in Western public policy in 19th-century Britain. Today it is a significant focus of interest in science, ethics, and animal welfare organizations.
There are two forms of criticism of the concept of animal welfare, coming from diametrically opposite positions. One view, dating back centuries, asserts that animals are not consciously aware and hence are unable to experience poor (or good) welfare. The other view is based on the animal rights position that animals should not be regarded as property and any use of animals by humans is unacceptable.  Accordingly, some animal rights proponents argue that the perception of better animal welfare facilitates continued and increased exploitation of animals.[tpl]cite book|last=Garner|first=R.|year=2005|title=Animal Ethics.|publisher=Polity Press[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Regan|first=T.|year=1983|title=The Case for Animal Rights|publisher=University of California Press[/tpl]  Some authorities therefore treat animal welfare and animal rights as two opposing positions.[tpl]cite book|last=Francione|first=G.L.|authorlink=Gary L.

The most widely held position in the western world is a mid-way utilitarian point-of-view; the position that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that adverse effects on animal welfare are minimized as much as possible.

[[Tomme de Savoie]]

CATEGORIES: French cheeses, Cow's-milk cheeses

Tomme de Savoie is a variety of Tomme cheese from Savoie in the French Alps. It is a mild, semi-firm cow's milk cheese with a beige interior and a thick brownish-grey rind.
Tomme de Savoie, like most Tommes, is usually made from the skim milk left over after the cream is used to make butter or richer cheeses. As a result, the cheese has a relatively low fat content (between 20 and 45%). The cheese is made year-round, and typically has a slightly different character depending on whether the cows are fed on winter hay or summer grass.
The cheese normally comes in discs approximately [tpl]convert|18|cm|in[/tpl] across, [tpl]convert|5|-|8|cm|in[/tpl] in thickness, and weighing between [tpl]convert|1|and|2|kg|lb[/tpl]. It is first pressed, and then matured for several months in a traditional cellar, which produces the characteristically thick rind and adds flavor.

[[Abelian extension]]
CATEGORIES: Field extensions, Algebraic number theory, Class field theory

In abstract algebra, an abelian extension is a Galois extension whose Galois group is abelian. When the Galois group is a cyclic group, we have a cyclic extension. A Galois extension is called solvable if its Galois group is solvable, i.e. if it is constructed from a series of abelian groups corresponding to intermediate extensions.
Every finite extension of a finite field is a cyclic extension. The development of class field theory has provided detailed information about abelian extensions of number fields, function fields of algebraic curves over finite fields, and local fields.
There are two slightly different concepts of cyclotomic extensions: these can mean either extensions formed by adjoining roots of unity, or subextensions of such extensions. The cyclotomic fields are examples. Any cyclotomic extension (for either definition) is abelian.
If a field K  contains a primitive n-th root of unity and the n-th root of an element of K is adjoined, the resulting so-called Kummer extension is an abelian extension (if K has characteristic p we should say that p doesn't divide n, since otherwise this can fail even to be a separable extension). In general, however, the Galois groups of n-th roots of elements operate both on the n-th roots and on the roots of unity, giving a non-abelian Galois group as semi-direct product. The Kummer theory gives a complete description of the abelian extension case, and the Kronecker–Weber theorem tells us that if K is the field of rational numbers, an extension is abelian if and only if it is a subfield of a field obtained by adjoining a root of unity.
There is an important analogy with the fundamental group in topology, which classifies all covering spaces of a space: abelian covers are classified by its abelianisation which relates directly to the first homology group.

John Gilbert "Jack" Layton, [tpl]post-nominals|country=CAN|PC[/tpl] (July 18, 1950 – August 22, 2011) was a Canadian social democratic politician and Leader of the Official Opposition. He was leader of the New Democratic Party from 2003 to 2011, and previously sat on Toronto City Council, occasionally holding the title of "Acting Mayor" or "Deputy Mayor" of Toronto during his tenure as city councillor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/toronto_history/councillors/2001-2003/layton1.htm|title=Former City Councillor Jack Layton|author=City of Toronto|accessdate=March 24, 2011|authorlink=Municipal government of Toronto[/tpl] He was the Member of Parliament for Toronto—Danforth from 2004 until his death.
Son of a Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, Layton was raised in Hudson, Quebec. He rose to prominence in Toronto municipal politics where he was one of the most prominent left-wing voices on city and Metropolitan Toronto councils, championing many progressive causes. In 1991, he ran for mayor, losing to June Rowlands. Returning to council he rose to become head of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. In 2003, he was elected leader of the federal NDP on the first ballot of the convention.
Under his leadership, support for the NDP increased in each election. The party's popular vote almost doubled in the 2004 election, which gave the NDP the balance of power in Paul Martin's minority government. In May 2005 the NDP supported the Liberal budget in exchange for major amendments, in what was promoted as Canada's "First NDP budget".[tpl]cite web|last=Campion-Smith|first=Bruce|title=Good for Canada, Layton declares; Commons backs 'first NDP budget'|work=Toronto Star|location=Toronto, Ontario|date=May 20, 2005|page=A6[/tpl] In November of that year, Layton voted with other opposition parties to defeat the Liberal government over the findings of the Gomery Commission. The NDP saw further gains in the 2006 and 2008 elections, in which the party elected 29 and 37 MPs, respectively.
In the 2011 election Layton led the NDP to the most successful result in the party's history, winning 103 seats—enough to form Canada's Official Opposition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/ndp-won-canadians-hearts-votes-broke-liberals-bloc-222048905.html|title=How NDP won the Canadians' hearts and votes and broke the Liberals and Bloc|last=The Canadian Press|publisher=Yahoo!

Layton died on August 22, 2011, aged 61, after suffering from an undisclosed type of cancer. He was survived by his wife of 23 years, fellow MP Olivia Chow. Shortly before, he had named Nycole Turmel as interim leader of both the New Democratic Party and subsequently of the Official Opposition; Thomas Mulcair eventually won the formal leadership election that followed.

[[Tomme]]

CATEGORIES: French cheeses

Tomme ([tpl]IPA-fr|tɔm[/tpl]), occasionally spelled Tome, is a type of cheese, and is a generic name given to a class of cheese produced mainly in the French Alps and in Switzerland.Joel Robuchon et al., Larousse Gastronomique (New York, New York:  Clarkson  Potter, 2001), page 1220.  It can be made from cow's, ewe's, or goat's milk.  Tommes are normally produced from the skim milk left over after the cream has been removed to produce butter and richer cheeses, or when there is too little milk to produce a full cheese.  As a result, they are generally low in fat.However, Tomme de Boudane and Tomme de Revard can contain as much as 20-40% fat.  (Larousse (2001), p. 1220.)
There are many varieties of Tommes, which are usually identified by their place of origin.  The most famous of these is Tomme de Savoie.  Other Tommes include Tomme Boudane, Tomme au Fenouil, Tomme de Crayeuse, Tomme d'Aydius, Tomme de Grandmère, Tomme Affinée, and Tomme du Revard. Tomme de Montagne is a collective term for the upland varieties, e.g. Tomme de Savoie but not Tomme de Beaujolais.
Tomme is traditionally used to make aligot and truffade, two Auvergnat dishes combining melted cheese and mashed or sautéed potatoes.

The Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra (GSO; [tpl]lang-sv|Göteborgs Symfoniker[/tpl]) is a symphony orchestra based in Gothenburg, Sweden. Founded in 1905, it was granted the title of the National Orchestra of Sweden ([tpl]lang-sv|Sveriges Nationalorkester[/tpl]) in 1997.  The GSO is resident at the Gothenburg Concert Hall at Götaplatsen.
Although the GSO has a broad repertoire, it has a special affinity for the works of the Nordic Late Romantic composers, such as Jean Sibelius and Edvard Grieg, which has comprised the bulk of its recorded output, as well as Neeme Järvi's specialty, Prokofiev. During Järvi's 22 years as principal conductor, the orchestra's longest, its reputation on the world stage was greatly increased, including sponsorships from Volvo and a recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon.[tpl]cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Sibelius: The Symphonies, Gothenburg SO/ Jarvi(Deutsche Grammophon, four SACDs) | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/sep/09/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 | work=The Guardian | date=2005-09-09 | accessdate=2012-07-22[/tpl]  Järvi currently holds the title of Principal Conductor Emeritus (Chefdirigent Emeritus) with the GSO.

[[Orlando Furioso]]

CATEGORIES: Epic poems in Italian, 1516 books, Italian poems, Roland, Matter of France, Romance (genre)

Orlando Furioso (The Frenzy of Orlando, more literally Mad Orlando; in Italian furioso is seldom capitalized) is an Italian epic poem by Ludovico Ariosto which has exerted a wide influence on later culture. The earliest version appeared in 1516, although the poem was not published in its complete form until 1532. Orlando Furioso is a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando Innamorato ("Orlando in Love", published posthumously in 1495). The action takes place against the background of the war between Charlemagne's Christian paladins and the Saracen army that is attempting to invade Europe. Ariosto has little concern for historical or geographical accuracy, and the poem wanders at will from Japan to the Hebrides, as well as including many fantastical and magical elements (such as a trip to the moon, and an array of fantastical creatures including a gigantic sea monster called the orc, and the hippogriff). Many themes are interwoven in its complicated episodic structure, but the most important plot is the paladin Orlando's unrequited love for the pagan princess Angelica, which develops into the madness of the title. After this comes the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero, who are supposed to be the ancestors of Ariosto's patrons, the d'Este family of Ferrara.Waley's introduction, passim
The poem is divided into forty-six cantos, each containing a variable number of eight-line stanzas in ottava rima (a rhyme scheme of abababcc). Ottava rima had been used in previous Italian romantic epics, including Luigi Pulci's Morgante and Boiardo's Orlando Innamorato. Ariosto's work is 38,736 lines long in total, making it one of the longest poems in European literature.Reynolds p. 12

[[Synchronization gear]]

CATEGORIES: Military aviation, Machine guns, Mechanisms

A Synchronization gear, or a gun synchronizer, sometimes rather less accurately referred to as an interrupter, is attached to the armament of a single engined tractor-type aircraft so that it can fire through the arc of its spinning propeller without the bullets striking the blades. The idea presupposes a fixed armament that is directed by aiming the aircraft in which it is fitted at the target, rather than aiming the gun independently.
There are many practical problems, mostly arising from the inherently imprecise nature of an automatic gun's firing, the great (and varying) velocity of the blades of a spinning propeller, and the very high speed at which any gear synchronizing the two has to operate.
Design and experimentation with gun synchronization had been underway in France and Germany in 1913/14, following the ideas of August Euler, who seems to have been the first to suggest mounting a fixed armament firing in the direction of flight (in 1910). The first practical, (if far from reliable) gear to enter operational service was however that fitted to the Eindecker monoplane fighters that entered squadron service with the German Air Service in mid 1915. The success of the Eindecker led to numerous gun synchronization devices – culminating in the reasonably reliable hydraulic British Constantinesco gear of 1917. By the end of the war German engineers were well on the way to perfecting a gear using an electrical rather than a mechanical or hydraulic link between the engine and the gun, with the latter being triggered by a solenoid rather than by a mechanical "trigger motor".
From 1918 to the mid-thirties the standard armament for a fighter aircraft remained two synchronized rifle calibre machine guns, firing forward through the propeller. During the late thirties, however, the main role of the fighter was increasingly seen as the destruction of large, all-metal bombers, for which the "traditional" light armament was inadequate.
Since it was impractical to try to fit more than one or two extra guns in the constrained space available in the front of a single-engined aircraft's fuselage, this lead to an increasing proportion of the armament being mounted in the wings, firing outside the arc of the propeller. There were in fact some advantages in dispensing with centrally mounted guns altogether. Nevertheless, the conclusive redundancy of synchronization gears did not finally come until the introduction of jet propulsion and the absence of a propeller for guns to be synchronized with.

[[Modularity theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic curves, Riemann surfaces, Modular forms, Theorems in number theory, Theorems in algebraic geometry

In mathematics, the modularity theorem (formerly called the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture and several related names) states that elliptic curves over the field of rational numbers are related to  modular forms.  Andrew Wiles proved the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which was enough to imply Fermat's last theorem. Later, Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and Richard Taylor extended Wiles' techniques to prove the full modularity theorem in 2001. 
The modularity theorem is a special case of more general conjectures due to Robert Langlands. The Langlands program seeks to attach an automorphic form or automorphic representation (a suitable generalization of a modular form) to more general objects of arithmetic algebraic geometry, such as to every elliptic curve over a number field.  Most cases of these extended conjectures have not yet been proved.

[[Turf war]]

CATEGORIES: Organizational conflict

A turf war is "a bitter struggle for territory, power, control, or rights". For example: a turf war erupted between street gangs; the president's resignation was the result of a turf war with the board of directors.http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=turf%20war In larger companies, turf wars can break out due to improper management further up the corporate hierarchy. It can also be described as contention for any resource between two or more parties, resulting in confrontation. The phrase may have originated in the American West, where cow herders and sheep herders fought over grazing turf.
Turf wars are fought between outlaw motorcycle clubs, street gangs, mafias, war lords, drug cartels, militant wings of political parties, or religious groups, etc. for control of a particular area or spot to sell drugs, or to collect taxation / danegeld / tribute money, or to promote one's own religious / political ideology there while stopping others trying to do the same. Examples of drug-related turf wars are the Latin American (particularly Mexican and Colombian) drug mafias/gangs trying to illegally expand and defend their "area of operations" against other rival cartels, gangs, and mafias.
Turf wars in innovation or technology could mean large companies not allowing an innovation or a new technology from a smaller company or a rival to take off by disturbing whatever is within their means, such as ecosystem, standards, devices, and usability, even though the adoption of the new technology could lead to greater sales or profitability for the company. Large companies try their best to avoid adoption of innovations of smaller start ups, which makes their own previous work irrelevant or exposes flaws or the threat of critical dependence on a monopoly supplier of that technology. These are also examples of turf wars in the sense that a smaller company or a rival has entered into a space that they had held reserved to themselves in competence and all development work sourced internally.

In mathematics, the common logarithm is the logarithm with base 10. It is also known as the decadic logarithm and also as the decimal logarithm, named after its base, or Briggsian logarithm, after Henry Briggs, an English mathematician who pioneered its use. It is indicated by log10(x), or sometimes Log(x) with a capital L (however, this notation is ambiguous since it can also mean the complex natural logarithmic multi-valued function). On calculators it is usually "log", but mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm rather than common logarithm when they write "log". To mitigate this ambiguity the ISO specification is that log10(x) should be lg (x) and loge(x) should be ln (x).

BASIC Programming attempted to teach simple computer programming on the Atari 2600. It was released for the Atari 2600 console in 1979 and it was one of only a few non-gaming cartridges released by the company. This program allowed consumers to create some simple programs using its own unique programming language, which was superficially similar to dialects of BASIC, but differed in many important aspects. The extremely small RAM size of the Atari 2600, 128 bytes, severely restricted the possibilities of this cartridge for writing any programs.
The BASIC Programming display was divided into six regions:
Input was given through two Atari keyboard controllers, which came with special overlays to show how to type the different commands and letters.  Programs were restricted only up to 64 characters in size and 9 lines of code and thereby severely limiting anything other than programs such as printing names or moving a block across the screen. The cartridge intended to teach programming using its keypad controllers, which was not really a suitable medium of input for programming. Users could disable all windows except Program and keep selecting "New Line" until over nine empty lines had been entered and thus their program could use 11 lines of code using this trick. Given these limitations, Basic Programming cartridge never took off and is considered to be a novel but a failed product.

The Heinkel He 111 was a German aircraft designed by Siegfried and Walter Günter in the early 1930s in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Often described as a "wolf in sheep's clothing","Heinkel He 111". Network Projects Production, 1993.Mackay 2003, p. 7. it masqueraded as a transport aircraft, though its actual purpose was to provide the Luftwaffe with a fast medium bomber.
Perhaps the best-recognised German bomber due to the distinctive, extensively glazed, bullet-shaped "greenhouse" nose of later versions, the Heinkel was the most numerous and the primary Luftwaffe bomber during the early stages of World War II.  It fared well until the Battle of Britain, when its weak defensive armament, relatively low speed, and poor manoeuvrability were exposed. Nevertheless, it proved capable of sustaining heavy damage and remaining airborne. As the war progressed, the He 111 was used in a variety of roles on every front in the European Theatre. It was used as a strategic bomber during the Battle of Britain, a torpedo bomber during the Battle of the Atlantic, and a medium bomber and a transport aircraft on the Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and North African Fronts.
Although constantly upgraded, the Heinkel He 111 became obsolete during the latter part of the war. It was intended to be replaced by the Luftwaffe's Bomber B project, but the delays and eventual cancellation of the project forced the Luftwaffe to continue using the He 111 until the end of the war. Manufacture ceased in 1944, at which point, piston-engine bomber production was largely halted in favour of fighter aircraft. With the German bomber force defunct, the He 111 was used for transport and logistics.
The design of the Heinkel endured after the war in the CASA 2.111. The Spanish received a batch of He 111H-16s in 1943 along with an agreement to licence-build Spanish versions. Its airframe was produced in Spain under license by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. The design differed significantly in powerplant only. The Heinkel's descendant continued in service until 1973.

[[Online chat]]

CATEGORIES: Internet culture, Online chat

Online chat may refer to any kind of communication over the Internet that offers a real-time transmission of text messages from sender to receiver. Chat messages are generally short in order to enable other participants to respond quickly. Thereby, a feeling similar to a spoken conversation is created, which distinguishes chatting from other text-based online communication forms such as Internet forums and email. Online chat may address point-to-point communications as well as multicast communications from one sender to many receivers and voice and video chat, or may be a feature of a web conferencing service.
Online chat in a less stringent definition may be primarily any direct text-based or video-based (webcams), one-on-one chat or one-to-many group chat (formally also known as synchronous conferencing), using tools such as instant messengers, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), talkers and possibly MUDs. The expression online chat comes from the word chat which means "informal conversation". Online chat includes web-based applications that allow communication –often directly addressed, but anonymous between users in a multi-user environment. Web conferencing is a more specific online service, that is often sold as a service, hosted on a web server controlled by the vendor.

The villages are situated on the A246 which is the main route for traffic travelling between the Surrey towns of Leatherhead and Guildford. Whilst once two distinct villages, the Bookhams have long been interconnected with residential roads that give most newcomers the impression that it is in fact one large village.
The village is well known as the location of Polesden Lacey, a country house located on the southern edge of the village, surrounded by over [tpl]convert|1000|acre|km2[/tpl] of grounds, now owned by the National Trust and open to the public.

Saṃsāra or Sangsāra (Sanskrit: संसार) (in Tibetan called 'khor ba (pronounced kɔrwɔ IPA in many Tibetan dialects), meaning "continuous flow"), is the repeating cycle of birth, life and death (reincarnation) within Hinduism, Buddhism, Bön, Jainism, Taoism,简论道教与佛教生死观的差异 and Yârsân. In Sikhism this concept is slightly different and looks at one's actions in the present and consequences in the present.
According to the view of these religions, a person's current life is only one of many—stretching back before birth into past existences and reaching forward beyond death into future incarnations. During the course of each life the quality of the actions (karma) performed determine the future destiny of each person. The Buddha taught that there is no beginning to this cycle but that it can be ended through perceiving reality. The goal of these religions is to realize this truth, the achievement of which (like ripening of a fruit) is mokshaor liberation. 
In popular use, Samsara westernized spelling may refer to the world (in the sense of the various worldly activities which occupy ordinary, ignorant human beings), the various sufferings thereof; or (mistakenly) the unsettled and agitated mind through which reality is perceived.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]

Haroldson Lafayette "H. L." Hunt, Jr. (February 17, 1889 – November 29, 1974), known throughout his life as "H. L. Hunt," was a Texas oil tycoon and conservative Republican political activist. By trading poker winnings for oil rights, he ultimately secured title to much of the East Texas Oil Field, one of the world's largest oil deposits. From it and his other acquisitions, he accrued a fortune that was among the world's largest; at the time of his death, he was reputed to have the highest net worth of any individual in the world. His personal life, which featured many children by three wives, was among the chief inspirations for the television series Dallas, whose character J.R. Ewing was largely based on popular perceptions of Hunt. The Texas city of Hunt is named after him.

Literally "burning ones", the word seraph is normally a synonym for serpents when used in the Hebrew Bible. A seminal passage in the Book of Isaiah ([tpl]bibleref2|Isaiah|6:1-8[/tpl]) used the term to describe fiery six-winged beings that fly around the Throne of God crying "holy, holy, holy". This throne scene, with its triple invocation of holiness (a formula that came to be known as the Trisagion), profoundly influenced subsequent theology, literature and art. Its influence is frequently seen in works depicting angels, heaven and apotheosis. Seraphs are mentioned as celestial beings in an influential Hellenistic work, the Book of Enoch, and the Book of Revelation. Tradition places seraphs in the fifth rank of ten in the Jewish angelic hierarchy and the highest rank in the Christian angelic hierarchy.

A posset (also spelled poshote, poshotte) was a British hot drink of milk curdled with wine or ale, often spiced, which was popular from medieval times to the 19th century. The word is mainly used nowadays for a related dessert similar to syllabub. In the Middle Ages, it was used as a cold and flu remedy and was more of a drink than a mousse. 
To make the drink, milk was heated to a boil, then mixed with wine or ale, which curdled it, and the mixture was usually spiced.Item 130, An Ordinance of Pottage, Hieatt 1988.
It was considered a specific remedy for some minor illnesses, such as a cold, and a general remedy for others, as even today people drink hot milk to help them get to sleep.

The earliest surviving recipe, from 1300–1325, is simply a list of ingredients: wine, wheat starch, raisins, and sugar to "abate the strength of the wine".Item 5, Diuersa Cibaria, BL MS Add.  46919 ff, 19r-24v, reprinted in Hieatt & Butler, Curye on Inglysch, Early English Text Society 1985, ISBN 0-19-722409-1, p. 45
Another recipe from the late 14th century has more ingredients and more details on the cooking procedure: mix breadcrumbs, wine, sugar or honey, and saffron, bring to a boil, then thicken with egg yolks, and sprinkle with salt, sugar, and ginger.

The Niagara Escarpment is a long escarpment, or cuesta, in the United States and Canada that runs predominantly east/west from New York State, through Ontario, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. It is composed of the Lockport geological formation of Silurian age, and is similar to the Onondaga geological formation, which runs parallel to it and just to the south, through western New York and southern Ontario. The escarpment is most famous as the cliff over which the Niagara River plunges at Niagara Falls, for which it is named.
The Niagara Escarpment is the most prominent of several escarpments formed in the bedrock of the Great Lakes basin. From its easternmost point near Watertown, New York,Lake Ontario Waterkeeper. Waterkeeper.ca (2010-12-03). Retrieved on 2013-07-26. the escarpment shapes in part the individual basins and landforms of Lakes Ontario, Huron and Michigan. In Rochester, New York, there are three waterfalls over the escarpment where the Genesee River flows through the city. The escarpment thence runs westward to the Niagara River forming a deep gorge north of Niagara Falls, which itself cascades over the escarpment. In southern Ontario it spans the Niagara Peninsula, closely following the Lake Ontario shore through the cities of St. Catharines, Hamilton and Dundas, where it takes a sharp turn north in the town of Milton toward Georgian Bay. It then follows the Georgian Bay shore northwestwards to form the spine of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island, as well as several smaller islands located in northern Lake Huron where it turns westwards into the Upper Peninsula of northern Michigan, south of Sault Ste. Marie. It then extends southwards into Wisconsin following the Door Peninsula through the Bayshore Blufflands and then more inland from the western coast of Lake Michigan and Milwaukee, ending northwest of Chicago near the Wisconsin-Illinois border.

[[Transform fault]]

CATEGORIES: Structural geology, Plate tectonics

A transform fault or transform boundary, also known as conservative plate boundary since these faults neither create nor destroy lithosphere, is a type of fault whose relative motion is predominantly horizontal in either sinistral or dextral direction.  Furthermore, transform faults end abruptly and are connected on both ends to other faults, ridges, or subduction zones.[tpl]cite book|last=Kerey|first=K. A.|title=Global Tectonics|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA|pages=84–90[/tpl] While most transform faults are hidden in the deep oceans where they form a series of short zigzags accommodating seafloor spreading (see graphic at right), the best-known (and most destructive) are those on land at the margins of tectonic plates. Transform faults are the only type of strike-slip fault that can be classified as a plate boundary.

The original sense of "demon", from the time of Homer onward, was a benevolent being,van der Toorn, Becking, van der Horst (1999), Dictionary of Deities and Demons in The Bible, Second Extensively Revised Edition, Entry: Demon, pp. 235-240, William B.

(In order to keep the distinction, when referring to the word in its original Greek meaning English uses the spelling "Daemon" or "Daimon".)
Demons, when regarded as spirits, may belong to either of the classes of spirits recognized by primitive animism;Animism at The Catholic Encyclopedia that is to say, they may be human, or non-human, separable souls, or discarnate spirits which have never inhabited a body.  A sharp distinction is often drawn between these two classes, notably by the Melanesians, several African groups, and others; the Arab jinn, for example, are not reducible to modified human souls; at the same time these classes are frequently conceived as producing identical results, e.g. diseases.

This page serves as a central navigational point for lists of more than 2,350 members of the University of Oxford, divided into relevant groupings for ease of use. The vast majority were students at the university, although they did not necessarily take a degree; others have held fellowships at one of the university’s colleges; many fall into both categories. This page does not include people whose only connection with the university consists in the award of an honorary degree or an honorary fellowship.
The list has been divided into categories indicating the field of activity in which people have become well known. Many of the university’s alumni/ae, or old members, as they are more traditionally known, have attained a level of distinction in more than one field. These appear only in the category with which it is felt they are most often associated, or in which they have been more recently involved. Hence Jeffrey Archer (Brasenose), a novelist, is listed as a life peer; Imran Khan (Keble), a former captain of the Pakistani cricket team, is listed as a Pakistani politician. Some academic disciplines are more difficult to define than others. In particular, many theologians, lawyers, and sociologists work in areas that might be thought to be encompassed by philosophy.
Oxonians (a term for members of the university derived from its Latin name, Academia Oxoniensis) have included two British kings and at least twelve monarchs of ten other sovereign states, twenty-five British prime ministers, and thirty-five presidents and prime ministers of nineteen other countries. There are currently eighteen Oxonians in Her Majesty's Government, including eight in the Cabinet. Thirteen members of the Shadow Cabinet, as well as Boris Johnson, the Conservative Mayor of London, were educated at Oxford.
The university lays claim to twelve saints, ten blesseds, an antipope, eighteen cardinals, and eighty-nine archbishops (including thirty-two of Canterbury and twenty-two of York).
This list also includes twenty-five princes and princesses (among them the heirs apparent of Belgium, Brunei, and Japan), thirty-four dukes, nineteen marquesses, eighty-two earls and countesses, forty-six viscounts and viscountesses, and 188 barons and baronesses; 246 bishops (Anglican and Catholic); 291 Members of Parliament (excluding MPs who were subsequently peers), eleven Members of the European Parliament (excluding MEPs also serving at Westminster), twelve Lord Chancellors, nine Lord Chief Justices and twenty-two law lords; ten US Senators, ten US Representatives (including a Speaker of the House), three state governors, and four associate justices of the US Supreme Court; as well as six puisne justices of the Supreme Court of Canada and a chief justice of the now defunct Federal Court of Canada.

[[Supply-side economics]]
CATEGORIES: Macroeconomics, Economic theories, Taxation and efficiency

Supply-side economics is a school of macroeconomics that argues that economic growth can be most effectively created by lowering barriers for people to produce (supply) goods and services as well as invest in capital. According to supply-side economics, consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services at lower prices; furthermore, the investment and expansion of businesses will increase the demand for employees.  Typical policy recommendations of supply-side economists are lower marginal tax rates and less regulation.[tpl]cite book |title=The Way the World Works: How Economies Fail—and Succeed |last=Wanniski |first=Jude |authorlink= |year=1978 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=0-465-09095-8 |pages= |url= [/tpl]
The Laffer curve embodies a tenet of supply side economics: that government tax revenues from a specific tax are the same (nil) at 100% tax rates as at 0% tax rates respectively. The tax rate that achieves optimum, or highest government revenues is somewhere in between these two values.[tpl]cite news |first=Bruce |last=Bartlett |authorlink= |title=How Supply-Side Economics Trickled Down |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/opinion/06bartlett.html |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate= [/tpl]
The term "supply-side economics" was thought, for some time, to have been coined by journalist Jude Wanniski in 1975, but according to Robert D. Atkinson's Supply-Side Follies,Atkinson, Robert D. Supply-side Follies: Why Conservative Economics Fails, Liberal Economics Falters, and Innovation Economics Is the Answer. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. p. 50. Print.  the term "supply side" ("supply-side fiscalists") was first used by Herbert Stein, a former economic adviser to President Nixon, in 1976, and only later that year was this term repeated by Jude Wanniski.  Its use connotes the ideas of economists Robert Mundell and Arthur Laffer.

The Chicxulub crater ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|k|ʃ|ə|l|uː|b[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-myn|tʃʼikʃuluɓ|Maya:[/tpl]) is a prehistoric impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.[tpl]Cite Earth Impact DB | name = Chicxulub | accessdate = 2008-12-30 [/tpl] Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. The age of the Chicxulub asteroid impact and the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary) coincide precisely.[tpl]harvnb|Renne|Ludwig|Karner|2000[/tpl] The crater is more than [tpl]convert|180|km[/tpl] in diameter and [tpl]convert|20|km|abbr=on[/tpl] in depth, making the feature one of the largest confirmed impact structures on Earth; the impacting bolide that formed the crater was at least 10 km (6 mi) in diameter.
The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater, and gave up his search. Through contact with Alan Hildebrand, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.
The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the Cretaceous period, and the start of the Paleogene period. It coincides with the K-Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K–Pg boundary.Schulte, et al.Rincon.

[[Unterwalden]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Switzerland, Former cantons of Switzerland, Imperial valleys

Unterwalden (Latinized as Sylvania, later also Subsylvania as opposed to Supersylvania) is the old name of a forest-canton of the Old Swiss Confederacy in central Switzerland, south of Lake Lucerne, consisting of two valleys or Talschaften, now organized as two half-cantons, an upper part, Obwalden, and a lower part, Nidwalden.
Unterwalden was one of the three participants in the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy, named in the Pact of Brunnen of 1315 with Uri and Schwyz.
The division of Unterwalden into two separate territories, Obwalden and Nidwalden in the early period is less than clear. 
Unterwalden figures as communitas hominum Intramontanorum Vallis Inferioris  "community of the men between the mountains of the Lower Valley" in the Federal Charter of 1291; this is usually rendered as "the community of the Lower Valley of Unterwalden" in modern translations, and interpreted as Nidwalden or "Unterwalden proper". While Nidwalden and Obwalden may or may not have existed as independent sub-entities of Unterwalden during 1291-1315, there was an internal division between Obwalden and Nidwalden at least from 1350.
The flag of Unterwalden in the 14th and 15th centuries was divided horizontally into equal parts red over white, identical with the flag of Solothurn. After the accession of Solothurn to the Confederacy in 1481, there were two cantons with identical flags, sometimes disambiguated by modifying the design of Solothurn's flag. 
By 1600, Nidwalden was known as Unterwalden proper or Subsylvania, while Obwalden was known as "Unterwalden ob dem Wald", strictly speaking  an oxymoron, as it were Subsylvania super silva. From this time, there are also two separate coats of arms for the two half-cantons, the red-and-white flag for Unterwalden proper or Nidwalden, while Obwalden had a silver key in a red field. 
By the 1640s, these two designs were re-combined in a white-and-red key on a red-and-white field as the coat of arms of the united canton.
In Early Modern Switzerland, Unterwalden counted as a single state in "foreign relations" with the other member states of the Swiss Confederacy, but it consisted of two separate states internally, with separate governments, jurisdictions and separate flags.
Martin Zeiller in 1642 reports Unterwalden as divided in two separate Talschaften the inhabitants of which were derived from separate races, those of Obwalden from the "Romans", those in Nidwalden from the "Cimbri" (viz. Germans).

Its name is Latinized as Sylvania, and its date of foundation is given as 1315, the date of the Pact of Brunnen, taken as the traditional founding date of the Swiss Confederacy until the 19th century. The old flag of Unterwalden is also shown, identical to the later Flag of Solothurn.

Samael ([tpl]lang-he|סמאל[/tpl]) (Severity of God) (also Sammael or Samil) is an important archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic lore, a figure who is accuser, seducer and destroyer, and has been regarded as both good and evil. It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the Roman empire.
He is considered in Talmudic texts to be a member of the heavenly host (with often grim and destructive duties). One of Samael's greatest roles in Jewish lore is that of the angel of death. He remains one of the Lord's servants even though he appears to want men to do evil. As a good angel, Samael resides in the seventh heaven, although he is declared to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven. The reason for this being the presence of the throne of glory in the fifth heaven.Ascension of Isaiah

The food production for half the world's current population depends on this method for producing fertilizer. Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born–Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. He has also been described as the "father of chemical warfare" for his work developing and deploying chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I.

[[Parallel universe (fiction)]]

CATEGORIES: Parallel universes (fiction), Fiction, Science fiction themes, Setting

A parallel universe or alternative reality is a hypothetical self-contained separate reality coexisting with one's own. A specific group of parallel universes is called a "multiverse", although this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that constitute reality. While the terms "parallel universe" and "alternative reality" are generally synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term "alternative reality" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own. The term "parallel universe" is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe. A universe where the very laws of nature are different – for example, one in which there are no Laws of Motion – would in general count as a parallel universe but not an alternative reality.
The correct quantum mechanical definition of parallel universes is "universes that are separated from each other by a single quantum event."

John Adams, known as Jack Adams (4 December 1767 – 5 March 1829) was the last survivor of the Bounty mutineers who settled on Pitcairn Island in January 1790, the year after the mutiny.  His real name was John Adams, but he used the name Alexander Smith until he was discovered in 1808 by Captain Mayhew Folger of the American whaling ship Topaz.  His children used the surname "Adams".Frederick Chamier Jack Adams, the Mutineer  1838
The mutineers of HMS Bounty and their Tahitian companions settled on the island and set fire to the Bounty. The wreck is still visible underwater in Bounty Bay. Although the settlers were able to survive by farming and fishing, the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among the settlers. Alcoholism, murder, disease and other ills had taken the lives of most of the mutineers and Tahitian men. John Adams, Ned Young, and Matthew Quintal were the last three mutineers surviving in 1799 when Adams and Young got the thuggish Quintal drunk and killed him with a hatchet.[tpl]Find a Grave|9262134|Matthew Quintal[/tpl] Adams and Young then turned to the Scriptures using the ship's Bible as their guide for a new and peaceful society. thumb|left|100px|The grave of John Adams on Pitcairn IslandAs a result, Adams and Young embraced Christianity and taught the children to read and write using the Bible. Young eventually died of an asthmatic infection, but Adams continued his work of educating the women and children. The Pitcairners also converted to Christianity. (The Pitcairners would later convert from their existing form of Christianity to Adventism after a successful Adventist mission in the 1890s.)
The American sailing ship Topaz was the first to rediscover Pitcairn in 1808. John Adams was eventually granted amnesty for the mutiny. On 17 December 1825 Adams was married to Teio, or 'Mary', Teio had already borne Adams' only son, George Adams in 1804.
John Adams' grave on Pitcairn is the only known grave site of a Bounty mutineer.  It has a replacement headstone, the original lead-covered wooden grave marker having been taken back to Britain where it is now on display in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London.
The main settlement and capital of Pitcairn, Adamstown, is named for John Adams.

[[Félix Ravaisson-Mollien]]
CATEGORIES: 1813 births, 1900 deaths, French archaeologists, French philosophers, People from Namur (city)

Jean Gaspard Félix Ravaisson-Mollien ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʁavɛsɔ̃ mɔljɛ̃|lang[/tpl]; 23 October 1813 – 18 May 1900) was a French philosopher and archaeologist.
He was born at Namur.  After a successful course of study at the Collège Rollin, he went to Munich, where he attended the lectures of Schelling, and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work Essai sur la métaphysique d'Aristote, to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of Aristotle and the Peripatetics, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.
In 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled 'De l'habitude' (On Habit), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at Rennes. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Science, and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the Louvre (from 1870). He died in Paris.
In philosophy, he was one of the school of Victor Cousin, with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.
Ravaisson's chief philosophical works are: "Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton" (in the Revue des Deux Mondes, November, 1840); Rapport sur le stoicisme (1851); La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvième siècle (1868; 3rd ed, 1889); Morale et métaphysique (1893). Eminent as a philosopher, Ravaisson was also an archaeologist, and contributed articles on ancient sculpture to the Revue Archéologique and the Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions. In 1871 he published a monograph on the Venus de Milo.
See Charles Bernard Renouvier, in L'Année philosophique (Paris, 1868); Dauriac, "Ravaisson philosophe et critique" (La Critique philosophique, 1885, vol. ii.).

The Class A4 is a class of streamlined 4-6-2 steam locomotive designed by Nigel Gresley for the London and North Eastern Railway in 1935. Their streamlined design gave them high-speed capability as well as making them instantly recognisable, and one of the class, 4468 Mallard, holds the world record as the fastest steam locomotive. Thirty-five of the class were built to haul express passenger trains on the East Coast Main Line route from London Kings Cross via York and Newcastle to Edinburgh, Scotland. They remained in service on the East Coast mainline until the early 1960s when they were replaced by Deltic diesel locomotives. Several A4s saw out their remaining days until 1966 in Scotland, particularly on the Aberdeen - Glasgow express trains, for which they were used to improve the timing from 3.5 to 3 hours.

Étienne Joseph Louis Garnier-Pagès (December 27, 1801 – June 23, 1841) was a French politician, born at Marseille.
Soon after his birth his father Jean Francois Garnier, a naval surgeon, died, and his mother married Simon Pagès, a college professor, by whom she had a son. The boys were brought up together, and took the double name Gamier-Pagès.
Étienne found employment first in a commercial house in Marseille, and then in an insurance office in Paris. In 1825 he began to study law, and made some mark as an advocate. A keen opponent of the Restoration, he joined various democratic societies, notably the Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera, an organization for purifying the elections.
He took part in the revolution of July 1830; became secretary of the Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera, whose propaganda he brought into line with his anti-monarchical ideas; and in 1831 was sent from Isère to the chamber of deputies. He was concerned in the preparation of the Compte rendu of 1832, and advocated universal suffrage. He was an eloquent speaker, and his sound knowledge of business and finance gave him a marked influence among all parties in the chamber.
His half-brother, Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès (1803 – October 31, 1878), fought on the barricades during the revolution of July.

He also made notable contributions to the classification of mental disorders and has been described by some as "the father of modern psychiatry". An 1809 description of a case that Pinel recorded in the second edition of a textbook on insanity is regarded as the earliest evidence for the existence of the form of mental disorder known as dementia praecox or schizophrenia in the 20th century.[tpl]cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Remains A challenge (timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific American Mind (March 2013)|accessdate=2 March 2013[/tpl]

[[Algebraic number theory]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic number theory

Algebraic number theory is a major branch of number theory that studies algebraic structures related to algebraic integers. This is generally accomplished by considering a ring of algebraic integers O in an algebraic number field K/Q, and studying their algebraic properties such as factorization, the behaviour of ideals, and field extensions. In this setting, the familiar features of the integers—such as unique factorization—need not hold. The virtue of the primary machinery employed—Galois theory, group cohomology, group representations, and L-functions—is that it allows one to deal with new phenomena and yet partially recover the behaviour of the usual integers.

[[Laplace operator]]

CATEGORIES: Differential operators, Elliptic partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, Harmonic functions, Linear operators in calculus, Multivariable calculus

In mathematics the Laplace operator or Laplacian is a differential operator given by the divergence of the gradient of a function on Euclidean space. It is usually denoted by the symbols ∇·∇, ∇2 or ∆.  The Laplacian ∆f(p) of a function f at a point p, up to a constant depending on the dimension, is the rate at which the average value of f over spheres centered at p, deviates from f(p) as the radius of the sphere grows. In a Cartesian coordinate system, the Laplacian is given by the sum of second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable. In other coordinate systems such as cylindrical and spherical coordinates, the Laplacian also has a useful form.
The Laplace operator is named after the French mathematician Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1749–1827), who first applied the operator to the study of celestial mechanics, where the operator gives a constant multiple of the mass density when it is applied to a given gravitational potential. Solutions of the equation ∆f = 0, now called Laplace's equation, are the so-called harmonic functions, and represent the possible gravitational fields in free space.
The Laplacian occurs in differential equations that describe many physical phenomena, such as electric and gravitational potentials, the diffusion equation for heat and fluid flow, wave propagation, and quantum mechanics.  The Laplacian represents the flux density of the gradient flow of a function.  For instance, the net rate at which a chemical dissolved in a fluid moves toward or away from some point is proportional to the Laplacian of the chemical concentration at that point; expressed symbolically, the resulting equation is the diffusion equation.  For these reasons, it is extensively used in the sciences for modelling all kinds of physical phenomena. The Laplacian is the simplest elliptic operator, and is at the core of Hodge theory as well as the results of de Rham cohomology. In image processing and computer vision, the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as blob and edge detection.

The Fifth Republic Movement (Spanish: Movimiento V Quinta República, MVR) was a left-wing,  Socialist political party in Venezuela. It was founded in July 1997, following a national congress of the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200, to support the candidacy of Hugo Chávez, the former President of Venezuela, in the 1998 presidential election. The "Fifth Republic" refers to the fact that in 1997 the Republic of Venezuela was the fourth in Venezuelan history, and the Movement aimed to re-found the Republic through a constitutional assembly. Following Chávez' 1998 election victory, this took place in 1999, leading to the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela.
At the legislative elections on 30 July 2000, the party won 91 out of 165 seats in the National Assembly.  On the same day Hugo Chávez was elected president in the presidential elections with 59.5% of votes.  In the parliamentary elections of 4 December 2005, the party won 114 out of 167 seats with allied parties winning the remaining seats. Opposition parties had unexpectedly withdrawn several days before election day, and turnout was just 25%.
In December 2006 and January 2007 the party started its dissolution, to form the proposed United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). It merged into PSUV on 20 October 2007.

A village green is a common open area within a settlement. Traditionally, a village green was often common grassland at the centre of an agricultural or other rural settlement, and was used for grazing. Some also have a pond, often originally for watering stock such as cattle.
The village green also provided, and may still provide, an open-air meeting place for the local people, which may be used for public celebrations such as May Day festivities.
The term village green evokes a grassy rural environment. However the term is used more broadly to encompass woodland, moorland, sports grounds, and even—in part—buildings and roads. The green may also be positioned away from the centre of the village, especially if the village has moved, or been absorbed into a larger settlement.

Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin: "after this, therefore because of this") is a logical fallacy (of the questionable cause variety) that states "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X." It is often shortened to simply post hoc. It is subtly different from the fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc (correlation does not imply causation), in which two things or events occur simultaneously or the chronological ordering is insignificant or unknown. Post hoc is a particularly tempting error because temporal sequence appears to be integral to causality. The fallacy lies in coming to a conclusion based solely on the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors that might rule out the connection.

A maypole is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.
The festivals may occur on May Day or Pentecost (Whitsun), although in some countries it is instead erected at Midsummer. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.
Primarily found within the nations of Germanic Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown, although it has been speculated that it originally had some importance in the Germanic paganism of Iron Age and early Medieval cultures, and that the tradition survived Christianisation, albeit losing any original meaning that it had. It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the Medieval and Early Modern periods, although became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in North America.

[[Camille Jordan (politician)]]
CATEGORIES: 1771 births, 1821 deaths, French politicians, Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery

Camille Jordan (11 January 1771 – 19 May 1821) was a French politician born in Lyon of a well-to-do mercantile family.
Jordan was educated in Lyon, and from an early age was imbued with royalist principles. He actively supported by voice, pen and musket his native town in its resistance to the Convention; and when Lyon fell, in October 1793, Jordan fled. From Switzerland he passed in six months to England, where he formed acquaintances with other French exiles and with prominent British statesmen, and imbibed a lasting admiration for the English Constitution.
In 1796 he returned to France, and next year he was sent by Lyon as a deputy to the Council of the Five Hundred. There his eloquence won him consideration. He earnestly supported what he felt to be true freedom, especially in matters of religious worship, though the energetic appeal on behalf of church bells in his Rapport sur la liberté des cultes procured him the sobriquet of "Jordan-Cloche". Proscribed at the coup d'état of the 18th Fructidor (4 September 1797) he escaped to Basel. Thence he went to Germany, where he met Goethe.
Back again in France by 1800, he boldly published in 1802 his Vrai sens du vote national pour le consulat à vie, in which he exposed the ambitious schemes of Bonaparte. He was unmolested, however, and during the First Empire lived in literary retirement at Lyon with his wife and family, producing for the Lyon academy occasional papers on the Influence réciproque de l'éloquence sur la Révolution et de la Révolution sur l'éloquence; Etudes sur Klopstock, etc.
At the restoration in 1814 he again emerged into public life. By Louis XVIII he was ennobled and named a councillor of state; and from 1816 he sat in the chamber of deputies as representative of Am. At first he supported the ministry, but when they began to show signs of reaction he separated from them, and gradually came to be at the head of the constitutional opposition. His speeches in the chamber were always eloquent and powerful. Though warned by failing health to resign, Camille Jordan remained at his post till his death at Paris, on 19 May 1821.
To his pen we owe [tpl]lang|fr|Lettre à M.

[[American Eskimo Dog]]

CATEGORIES: Spitz breeds, Dog breeds, Dog breeds originating in Germany, Companion dogs

 
The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog originating in Germany. The American Eskimo is a member of the Spitz family. Despite its name and appearance, the American Eskimo dog is not from Alaska; the dog's heritage is traced back to Northern Europe. The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German prejudice during the First World War, it was renamed "American Eskimo Dog". Although modern American Eskimos have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breed standards are actually significantly different. In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the 1930s and 1940s United States as a circus performer.
There are three size varieties of the American Eskimo breed, the toy, miniature and the standard. They share a common resemblance with Japanese Spitz and Samoyed dog.
Miniature American Eskimos, with their high intelligence and inquisitive nature,  will love to "investigate". If they find something very interesting they will often want their owner or handler to investigate as well, and will at times,  not let the "matter" go until the person complies.  You will often find this behavior when it comes to children; for instance, if a baby or child is crying, the American Eskimo will want you to see what the problem is and will not stop worrying until you do. The American Eskimo being so "tuned in" is one of the characteristics that makes them a desirable breed around children.

Teiji Takagi (高木 貞治 Takagi Teiji, April 21, 1875 – February 28, 1960) was a Japanese mathematician, best known for proving the Takagi existence theorem in class field theory. The Blancmange curve, the graph of a nowhere-differentiable but uniformly continuous function, is also called the Takagi curve after his work on it.
He was born in the mountainous and rural area of the Gifu Prefecture, Japan. He began learning mathematics in middle school, reading texts in English since none were available in Japanese. After attending a high school for gifted students, he went on to the University of Tokyo, at that time the only university in Japan. There he learned mathematics from such European classic texts as Salmon's Algebra and Weber's Lehrbuch der Algebra. Aided by Hilbert, he then studied at Göttingen. Aside from his work in algebraic number theory he wrote a great number of Japanese textbooks on mathematics and geometry.
He was also instrumental during World War II in the development of Japanese  encryption systems; see Purple.

[[Reflection nebula]]

CATEGORIES: Reflection nebulae, Nebulae

In astronomy, reflection nebulae are clouds of interstellar dust which reflect the light of a nearby star or stars. The energy from the nearby stars is insufficient to ionize the gas of the nebula to create an emission nebula, but is enough to give sufficient scattering to make the dust visible. Thus, the frequency spectrum shown by reflection nebulae is similar to that of the illuminating stars. Among the microscopic particles responsible for the scattering are carbon compounds (e. g. diamond dust) and compounds of other elements such as iron and nickel. The latter two are often aligned with the galactic magnetic field and cause the scattered light to be slightly polarized.Kaler, 1997.

[[Germans from Russia]]

CATEGORIES: Germans from Russia, Russian and Soviet-German people, Ethnic groups in Russia, History of Russia, 18th century in Germany

Germans from Russia refers to the large numbers of ethnic Germans who emigrated from the Russian Empire, peaking in the late 19th century.  The upper Great Plains in the United States and southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan have large areas populated primarily of descendants of Germans from Russia.  Argentina, Brazil and other countries have smaller numbers of Germans from Russia.
Their mother tongue was High German and Low German, despite their having lived in Russia for multiple generations.  The Germans in Russia frequently lived in ethnic German communities, where they maintained German-language schools and German churches.  Many of the Germans lived in the lower Volga River valley (they were also called Volga Germans) and the Crimean Peninsula/Black Sea region.  The smaller villages were often settled by colonists of a common religion, who had come from the same area, so one town might be all Catholic, or all Lutheran, for instance; the people often settled together from the same region of Germany and thus spoke the same German dialect. Also included were Germans of the Baptist and Mennonite faiths, seeking religious freedom.
Originally recruited and welcomed into Russia in the 18th century, when they were promised the practice of their own language and religions, and exemption from military service, the German people found increasing hardship.  With changes in Russian politics, the government took back some of the privileges granted; economic conditions grew poor, and there were a series of famines.  These conditions led to German mass migrations from Russia.
After the 1917 Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union, and particularly under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, conditions for the remaining Germans in Russia declined considerably.  The rise of Nazi Germany, with its concern about ethnic Germans in other lands and proselytizing the German volk, led to suspicions of any German within Russia.  In 1932-33, the Soviet authorities forced starvation among the Volga Germans, seized their food claiming  famine in the rest of the Soviet Union and ordering the breakup of many German villages.Koch, Fred C. (1977). The Volga Germans: In Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the Present, pp. 281-82. The Pennsylvania State University.
After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Stalin ordered the deportation of Russian Germans to labor camps in Siberia, as he was suspicious of potential collaboration with the Germans.Rappaport, Helen (1999). Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion, p. 191. ABC-CLIO, Inc.  In some areas, his forces attempted to bulldoze the German churches, and reused their tombstones for paving blocks.  Many Germans in the Americas sent donations back to their communities, but others permanently lost contact with their relatives during the social disruption of the famine and Stalin's Great Purge, followed by World War II.

[[Emission nebula]]

CATEGORIES: Nebulae, Emission nebulae

An emission nebula is a cloud of ionized gas emitting light of various colors. The most common source of ionization is high-energy photons emitted from a nearby hot star.  Among the several different types of emission nebulae are H II regions, in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons; and planetary nebulae, in which a dying star has thrown off its outer layers, with the exposed hot core then ionizing them.

[[Gravitational field]]

CATEGORIES: Theories of gravitation, Gravitation, Geodesy, General relativity

In physics, a gravitational field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body. Thus, a gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena, and is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg). In its original concept, gravity was a force between point masses. Following Newton, Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid, and since the 19th century explanations for gravity have usually been sought in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction.
In a field model, rather than two particles attracting each other, the particles distort spacetime via their mass, and this distortion is what is perceived and measured as a "force". In such a model one states that matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime,[ref]
, Chapter 7, page 181

The Canadian territory of Yukon has had a responsible government since 1978. In the 19th century, Yukon was a segment of the Hudson's Bay Company-administered North-Western Territory and then the Canadian-administered Northwest Territories. The territory only obtained a recognizable local government in 1895 when it became a separate district of the Northwest Territories.[tpl]harvnb|Coates|1988|p=74[/tpl] In 1898, Yukon was made a separate territory with its own commissioner and appointed Territorial Council.[tpl]harvnb|Coates|1988|p=103[/tpl] Prior to 1978, the territory had a legislature with a largely advisory role and no political parties or government leader. Instead, powers were invested in a governing Commissioner appointed by the federal government.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 10, 2008|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/provincial_territorial_politics/topics/2365/|title=Territorial Battles: Yukon Elections, 1978-2006 |publisher=CBC|date=November 22, 1978 [/tpl]

The  British Agricultural Revolution  was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in England due to increases in labor and land productivity that took place between 1750 and 1850, although it had its beginnings in the 17th century.  By 1750 agricultural output grew faster than population and the increase in food supply allowed the population of England to exceed 5.5 million for the first time.  Because the agricultural revolution freed up labor, providing an escape from the Malthusian trap, it is often cited as one of the causes of the Industrial Revolution.
Although it is called an agricultural revolution, the developments in Britain did not result in crop yields anywhere near as high as in China, where intensive cultivation had been practiced for many centuries.

Pool of Radiance is a role-playing video game developed and published by Strategic Simulations, Inc (SSI) in 1988. It was the first adaptation of TSR's Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D or D&D) fantasy role-playing game for home computers, becoming the first episode in a four-part series of D&D computer adventure games. The other games in the "Gold Box" series used the game engine pioneered in Pool of Radiance, as did later D&D titles such as the Neverwinter Nights online game. Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting, with the action centered in and around the port city of Phlan.
Just as in traditional D&D games, the player starts by building a party of up to six characters, deciding the race, sex, class and ability scores for each. The player's party is enlisted to help the settled part of the city by clearing out the marauding inhabitants that have taken over the surroundings. The characters move on from one area to another, battling bands of enemies as they go and ultimately confronting the powerful leader of the evil forces. During play the player characters gain experience points, which allow them to increase their capabilities. The game primarily uses a first-person perspective, with the screen divided into sections to display pertinent textual information. During combat sequences, the display switches to a top-down "video game isometric" view.[tpl]cite web|title=Top 100 RPGs of All Time|url=http://www.ign.com/top/rpgs/46|publisher=IGN|accessdate=9 April 2013[/tpl]
Generally well received by the gaming press, Pool of Radiance won the Origins Award for "Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988". Some reviewers criticized the game's similarities to other contemporary games and its slowness in places, but praised the game's graphics and its role-playing adventure and combat aspects. Also well-regarded was the ability to export player characters from Pool of Radiance to subsequent SSI games in the series.

[[Open field system]]

CATEGORIES: Agricultural economics, Agricultural soil science, History of agriculture, History of agriculture in the United Kingdom, History of England, Middle Ages

The open-field system was the prevalent agricultural system in much of Europe during the Middle Ages and lasted into the 20th century in parts of western Europe, Russia, and Iran.Keddie, Nicki R. Iran.  Religion, Politics and Society: Collected Essays London: Routledge, 1980, pp. 186-187 Under the open-field system, each manor or village had two or three large fields, usually several hundred acres each, which were divided into many narrow strips of land.  The strips or selions were cultivated by individuals or peasant families, often called tenants or serfs. The holdings of a manor also included woodland and pasture areas for common usage and fields belonging to the lord of the manor and the church. The farmers customarily lived in individual houses in a nucleated village with a much larger manor house and church nearby. The open-field system necessitated cooperation among the inhabitants of the manor.
The Lord of the Manor, his officials, and a Manorial court administered the manor and exercised jurisdiction over the peasantry. The Lord levied rents and required the peasantry to work on his personal lands, called a demesne.Astill, Grenville and Grant, Annie, eds. The Countryside of Medieval England Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988, pp.23, 64
In medieval times, little land was owned outright.  Instead the lord had rights given him by the king and the tenant rented land from the lord.  Lords demanded rents, often ruinous, and labor from the tenants, but the tenants had firm user rights to cropland and common land and those rights were passed down from generation to generation.  A medieval lord could not evict a tenant nor hire labor to replace him without legal cause.  Most tenants likewise were not free without penalty to depart the manor for other locations or occupations.  The rise of capitalism and the concept of land as a commodity to be bought and sold led to the demise of the open-field system.Kulikoff, Allan From British Peasants to Colonial American Farmers Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000, p. 11 The open-field system was gradually replaced over several centuries by private ownership of land, especially after the 15th century in the process known as Enclosure in England.  France, Germany, and other northern European countries had systems similar to England, although open fields generally endured longer on the continent.  Some elements of the open-field system were practised by early settlers in the New England region of the United States.Ault, W. O. Open-Field Farming in Medieval England London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1972, pp. 77-78

[[Phaistos Disc]]

The Phaistos Disc (also spelled Phaistos Disk, Phaestos Disc) is a disk of fired clay from the Minoan palace of Phaistos on the Greek island of Crete, possibly dating to the middle or late Minoan Bronze Age (2nd millennium BC). It is about 15 cm (5.9 in) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols. Its purpose and meaning, and even its original geographical place of manufacture, remain disputed, making it one of the most famous mysteries of archaeology. This unique object is now on display at the archaeological museum of Heraklion.
The disc was discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist Luigi Pernier in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos, and features 241 tokens, comprising 45 unique signs, which were apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic "seals" into a disc of soft clay, in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the disc's center.
The Phaistos Disc captured the imagination of amateur and professional archeologists, and many attempts have been made to decipher the code behind the disc's signs. While it is not clear that it is a script, most attempted decipherments assume that it is; most additionally assume a syllabary, others an alphabet or logography. Attempts at decipherment are generally thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs are found, as it is generally agreed that there is not enough context available for a meaningful analysis.
Although the Phaistos Disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists, a few scholars believe that the disc is a forgery or a hoax.

Wood gas is a syngas fuel which can be used as a fuel for furnaces, stoves and vehicles in place of gasoline, diesel or other fuels. During the production process biomass or other carbon-containing materials are gasified within the oxygen-limited environment of a wood gas generator to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These gases can then be burnt as a fuel within an oxygen rich environment to produce carbon dioxide, water and heat. In some gasifiers this process is preceded by pyrolysis, where the biomass or coal is first converted to char, releasing methane and tar rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

A dark nebula is a type of interstellar cloud that is so dense that it obscures the light from the background emission or reflection nebula (e.g., the Horsehead Nebula) or background stars (e.g., the Snake Nebula). (The term absorption nebula has also been applied to these phenomenon.) The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains located in the coldest, densest parts of larger[tpl]clarify|date=February 2009|what size is larger? Over 3 solar masses maybe? Do dust grains also cause extinction in smaller, Bok globule-size, clouds?[/tpl] molecular clouds. Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules. Like other interstellar dust/material, things it obscures are only visible using radio waves in radio astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy.
Dark clouds appear so because of submicrometre-sized dust particles, coated with frozen carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which effectively block the passage of light at visible wavelengths. Also present are molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, C18O, CS, NH3 (ammonia), H2CO (formaldehyde), c-C3H2 (cyclopropenylidene) and a molecular ion N2H+ (diazenylium), all of which are relatively transparent. These clouds are the spawning grounds of stars and planets, and understanding their development is essential to understanding star formation.James Di Francesco et al., 2002, "Abundances of Molecular Species in Barnard 68", The Astronomical Journal, 124, 2749ESO - eso9934 - Secrets of a Dark Cloud
The form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes. The largest dark nebulae are visible to the naked eye, appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way like the Coalsack Nebula and the Great rift.  These naked-eye objects are sometimes known as dark cloud constellations and take on a variety of names.
In the inner outer molecular regions of dark nebula important events take place, such as the formation of stars and masers.

Sir Thomas Browne ([tpl]IPAc-en|b|r|aʊ|n[/tpl]; 19 October 1605 – 19 October 1682) was an English polymath and author of varied works which reveal his wide learning in diverse fields including science and medicine, religion and the esoteric. Browne's writings display a deep curiosity towards the natural world, influenced by the scientific revolution of Baconian enquiry, while his Christian faith exuded tolerance and goodwill towards humanity in an often intolerant era.
A consummate literary craftsman, Browne's works are permeated by frequent references to Classical and Biblical sources and to his own highly idiosyncratic personality. His literary style varies according to genre, resulting in a rich, unusual prose that ranges from rough notebook observations to the highest Baroque eloquence.  Although often described as suffering from melancholia, Browne's writings are also characterised by wit and subtle humour.

Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or a Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk, is a work by Sir Thomas Browne, published in 1658  as the first part of a two-part work that concludes with The Garden of Cyrus.
Its nominal subject was the discovery of a Roman'Religio Medici, Hydriotaphia, and the Letter to a Friend (Revised Edition)' Thomas Browne, Echo Library : 2007 urn burial in Norfolk.  The discovery of these remains prompts Browne to deliver, first, a description of the antiquities found, and then a survey of most of the burial and funerary customs, ancient and current, of which his era was aware.
The most famous part of the work, though, is the fifth chapter, where Browne turns to discuss man's struggles with mortality, and the uncertainty of his fate and fame in this world and the next, to produce an extended funerary meditation tinged with melancholia.
George Saintsbury called it "the longest piece, perhaps, of absolutely sublime rhetoric to be found in the prose literature of the world," The following is a sample of the text. Browne rhetorically asks:

Cocteau Twins were a Scottish rock band active from 1979 to 1997, known for innovative instrumentationCritic Jack Rabid declares that guitarist Robin Guthrie "explored soundscapes barely touched on in pop history and atmospheric, non-lyrical vocals. The original members were Elizabeth Fraser (vocals), Robin Guthrie (guitar, drum machine) and Will Heggie (bass guitar), who was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde early in the band's career.
While the entire band earned much critical praise, Elizabeth Fraser's distinctive soprano vocals received the most attention. At times barely decipherable, Fraser seemed to veer into glossolalia and mouth music.

W.A.S.P. is an American heavy metal band formed in 1982. They emerged from the same Los Angeles scene that spawned Van Halen, Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Guns N' Roses and others. The band's popularity peaked in the 1980s, yet they continue to record and tour, making them one of the most enduring of the West Coast heavy metal bands. W.A.S.P. gained notoriety for their shock rock themed image, lyrics and live performances. They have sold over 12 million copies of their albums.
The band was a prominent target in the mid-1980s of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) led by Tipper Gore, who at the time was wife of then-Senator Al Gore (D-TN), an organization that pushed for warning labels on recorded music. The band immortalized its fight with the PMRC on the song "Harder, Faster" from their 1987 live album, Live...In the Raw.
"I Wanna Be Somebody" was the most successful single from W.A.S.P.'s debut album. and It was ranked at No. 84 in VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs of All Time.
In October 2007, W.A.S.P. embarked on The Crimson Idol Tour, to celebrate that album's 15th anniversary. It is the first time that the album, often regarded to be among the band's finest work, was performed in full from start to finish. The tour kicked off in Greece, in Thessaloniki at the Principal Club Theater on October 26, 2007.
Blackie Lawless remains the only member from the original line-up. They released their most recent album in November 2009, entitled Babylon.
On September 21, 2012, the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of their first ever live show by kicking off a world tour at The Forum in London. The set for the tour was split into three sections: songs from the first four albums, a cut-down rendition of the Crimson Idol performance and a final segment for newer material.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.waspnation.com/waspnation.htm |title=W.A.S.P. – "30 Years of Thunder" |author=W.A.S.P.

[[Stridulation]]

CATEGORIES: Entomology, Sound, Animal sounds

Stridulation is the act of producing sound by rubbing together certain body parts. This behavior is mostly associated with insects, but other animals are known to do this as well, such as a number of species of fish, snakes and spiders. The mechanism is typically that of one structure with a well-defined lip, ridge, or nodules (the "scraper" or plectrum) being moved across a finely-ridged surface (the "file" or stridulitrum—sometimes called the pars stridens) or vice-versa, and vibrating as it does so, like the dragging of a phonograph needle across a vinyl record. Sometimes it is the structure bearing the file which resonates to produce the sound, but in other cases it is the structure bearing the scraper, with both variants possible in related groups.[tpl]cite journal |first=C.

[[Legitimacy of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]

The legitimacy of the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been subject to question by individuals such as Nebojša Malićhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/nato-s-illegal-and-criminal-invasion-of-kosovo/459 and Noam Chomsky.http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200005--.htm The key basis governing the legality of any act of war is international law. In this particular case, a course of action is also bound by other foundations such as the NATO charter and the UN charter, both of which were drafted in accordance with preexisting international regulation. As such, the issue has been shady at times with proponents of both viewpoints citing particular legislation that substantiate their claims on whether the war was or was not legal.
Supporters of the campaign have argued that the action brought to an end the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's Albanian population, and that the bombing campaign hastened (or caused) the downfall of Slobodan Milošević's government, which they saw as responsible for the international isolation of Yugoslavia, many war crimes, and gross human rights violations. Others view the action as controversial.[tpl]cite book|last=Coleman|first=Katharina Pichler|title=International Organisations and Peace Enforcement: The Politics of International Legitimacy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-87019-1[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E1D9123FF93BA35755C0A9669C8B63|title= Rights Group Says NATO Bombing in Yugoslavia Violated Law|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=2000-06-08|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-11-13[/tpl] Noam Chomsky condemned NATO's military campaign in Yugoslavia, particularly its aerial bombing which included the bombing of electricity and water supplies and television stations as well as military targets.[tpl]cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=The New Military Humanism: Lessons from Kosovo|publisher=Pluto Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7453-1633-8[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/natosummit/balkans24.htm|title=Bit Players Become 'Frontline' States |authorlink=Vernon Loeb|last=Loeb |first=Vernon |date=1999-04-24 |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=2008-11-13[/tpl]

Degenerate art is the English translation of the German entartete Kunst, a term adopted by the Nazi regime in Germany to describe virtually all modern art. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or Jewish Bolshevist in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely.
Degenerate Art was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in Munich in 1937, consisting of modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria.
While modern styles of art were prohibited, the Nazis promoted paintings and sculptures that were traditional in manner and that exalted the "blood and soil" values of racial purity, militarism, and obedience. Similarly, music was expected to be tonal and free of any jazz influences; films and plays were censored.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10077 |title=The Collection | Entartete Kunst |publisher=MoMA |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Macroeconomics, Accounting systems

Accounting reform is an expansion of accounting rules that goes beyond the realm of financial measures for both individual economic entities and national economies.  It is advocated by those who consider the focus of the present standards and practices wholly inadequate to the task of measuring and reporting the activity, success, and failure of modern enterprise, including government.
Real debate concerns concepts such as whether to report transactions, such as asset acquisitions, at their cost or at their current market values. The former, traditional approach, appeals for its reliability, but can quickly lose its relevance due to inflation and other factors; the latter, increasingly common approach, is appealing for its relevance, but is less reliable due to the need to use subjective measures. Accounting standards setters such as the International Accounting Standards Board attempt to strike a balance between relevance and reliability.

[[Becan]]

CATEGORIES: Former populated places in Mexico, Maya sites in Campeche

Becan (Spanish: Becán) is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Becan is located near the center of the Yucatán Peninsula, in the present-day Mexican state of Campeche, about 150 km (93.2 mi) north of Tikal. The Maya sites of Balamku, Calakmul, Chicanna and Xpuhil are nearby. The name Becan was bestowed on the site by archaeologists who rediscovered the site, meaning "ravine or canyon formed by water" in Yukatek Maya, after the site's most prominent and unusual feature, its surrounding ditch.
Archaeological evidence shows that Becan was occupied in the middle Pre-Classic period (see: Mesoamerican chronology), about 550 BCE, and grew to a major population and ceremonial center a few hundred years later in the late Preclassic. The population and scale of construction declined in the early classic (c 250 CE), although it was still a significant site, and trade goods from Teotihuacan have been found. A ditch and ramparts were constructed around the site at this time. There is a ditch that runs the circumference of the city which covers approximately 25 hectares (61.7 acres). Around 500 the population again increased dramatically and many large new buildings were constructed, mostly in the Rio Bec style of Maya architecture. Construction of major buildings and elite monuments stopped about 830, although ceramic evidence show that the site continued to be occupied for some time thereafter, although the population went into decline and Becan was probably abandoned by about 1200. 
The site was first documented in the archaeological literature in 1934 by archaeologists Karl Ruppert and John Denison on an expedition to the region sponsored by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who named it "Becan" after the conspicuous ditch surrounding the center of the city; the ancient name of the site is not known. From 1969 to 1971 archaeological excavations were made at Becan sponsored by Tulane University and the National Geographic Society.

[[Catastrophism]]

CATEGORIES: History of Earth science, History of ideas, Creationism, Theories of history, Disasters

Catastrophism is the theory that the Earth has been affected in the past by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope. This was in contrast to uniformitarianism (sometimes described as gradualism), in which slow incremental changes, such as erosion, created all the Earth's geological features. Uniformitarianism held that the present is the key to the past, and that all things continued as they were from the indefinite past. Since the early disputes, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the scientific consensus accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past, but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur. 
Catastrophism held that geological epochs had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid formation of major mountain chains.  Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were killed off, being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of Noah's flood. 
The concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century French scientist Georges Cuvier, who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided  religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.

Ishi (c. 1860 – March 25, 1916) was the last member of the Yahi, the last surviving group of the Yana people of the U.S. state of California. Widely acclaimed in his time as the "last wild Indian" in America, Ishi lived most of his life completely outside modern culture. At about 49 years of age, in 1911, he emerged from "the wild" near Oroville, California, leaving his ancestral homeland, present-day Tehama County, near the foothills of Lassen Peak, known to Ishi as Wa ganu p'a.
Ishi means "man" in the Yana language. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave this name to the man because it was rude to ask someone's name in the Yahi culture. When asked his name, he said: "I have none, because there were no people to name me," meaning that no Yahi had ever spoken his name. He was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley, who both studied him and hired him as a research assistant. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco.

Bo Axel Magnus Lundgren (born July 11, 1947) is a Swedish politician. He was the leader of the Moderate Party from 1999 to 2003.The parliamentary election in Sweden, 2002, Anders Widfeldt, Electoral Studies 22, #4 (December 2003), pp. 778–784.
Lundgren served as Minister for Fiscal and Financial Affairs from 1991 to 1994 in the government of Carl Bildt, with responsibility mainly for financial markets, taxation and housing. The country faced a severe financial crisis after the bursting of a speculation bubble which had developed in the 1980s. The Swedish government's management of the crisis attracted international attention, especially after the late 2000s recession. Lundgren testified to the US Congressional Oversight Panel in 2009 and was also called to the European Parliament and the Irish Parliament to speak about management of financial crises.
In 1999, he succeeded Carl Bildt as party leader and became Leader of the Opposition. He resigned four years later after the party's poor results in the Swedish parliamentary election in 2002.Lundgren, Bo, Who's Who, The Local.  Accessed on line December 19, 2007. He was succeeded by Fredrik Reinfeldt, who would move the party to the political centre. He then served as director general of the Swedish National Debt Office (Riksgäldskontoret) from 2004 to 2013. He played a further role in the government's response to the late 2000s recession, along with Stefan Ingves the head of Sveriges Riksbank, which included the nationalisation of Carnegie Investment Bank. After leaving the Debt Office, he was appointed  chairman of Sparbanken Öresund as well as of some other institutions. He also received a PhD hc from Lund University in 2010.

[[Hartree]]
CATEGORIES: Units of energy, Physical constants

The hartree (symbol: ''E''h or Ha), also known as the Hartree energy, is the atomic unit of energy, named after the British physicist Douglas Hartree. It is defined as 
2R∞hc, where R∞ is the Rydberg constant, h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light.  
The 2010 CODATA recommended value is Eh = [tpl]nowrap|4.359 744 34(19)[tpl]e|−18[/tpl] J[/tpl]= [tpl]nowrap|27.211 385 05(60) eV[/tpl].CODATA2010 The 2006 CODATA recommended value was Eh = [tpl]nowrap|4.359 743 94 (22)[tpl]e|−18[/tpl] J[/tpl] = [tpl]nowrap|27.211 383 86(68) eV[/tpl].
The hartree energy is approximately the electric potential energy of the hydrogen atom in its ground state and, by the virial theorem, approximately twice its ionization energy; the relationships are not exact because of the finite mass of the nucleus of the hydrogen atom and relativistic corrections.
The hartree is usually used as a unit of energy in atomic physics and computational chemistry: for experimental measurements at the atomic scale, the electronvolt (eV) or the reciprocal centimetre (cm−1) are much more widely used.

Mayapan (Màayapáan in Modern Maya), (in Spanish  Mayapán) is a Pre-Columbian Maya site a couple of kilometers south of the town of Telchaquillo in Municipality of Tecoh, approximately 40 km south-east of Mérida and 100 km west of Chichen Itza; in the state of Yucatán, Mexico. Mayapan was the political and cultural capital of the Maya in the Yucatán Peninsula during the Late Post-Classic period from the 1220s until the 1440s. Estimates of the total city population are 15,000-17,000 persons, and the site has more than 4000 structures within the city walls, and additional dwellings outside.
The site has been professionally surveyed and excavated by archeological teams, beginning in 1939; five years of work was done by a team in the 1950s, and additional studies were done in the 1990s. Since 2000, a collaborative Mexican-United States team has been conducting excavations and recovery at the site, which continue.

[[Functional predicate]]

CATEGORIES: Model theory

In formal logic and related branches of mathematics, a functional predicate, or function symbol, is a logical symbol that may be applied to an object term to produce another object term.
Functional predicates are also sometimes called mappings, but that term has other meanings as well.
In a model, a function symbol will be modelled by a function.
Specifically, the symbol F in a formal language is a functional symbol if, given any symbol X representing an object in the language, F(X) is again a symbol representing an object in that language.
In typed logic, F is a functional symbol with domain type T and codomain type U if, given any symbol X representing an object of type T, F(X) is a symbol representing an object of type U.
One can similarly define function symbols of more than one variable, analogous to functions of more than one variable; a function symbol in zero variables is simply a constant symbol.
Now consider a model of the formal language, with the types T and U modelled by sets T and U and each symbol X of type T modelled by an element X in T.
Then F can be modelled by the set
which is simply a function with domain T and codomain U.
It is a requirement of a consistent model that F(X) = F(Y) whenever X = Y.

[[Cracker (food)]]
CATEGORIES: Crackers (food), Snack foods

A cracker is a baked good typically made from a grain and flour,dough and usually manufactured in large quantities. Crackers (roughly equivalent to savory biscuits in the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man) are usually flat, crisp, small in size (usually 3 inches or less in diameter) and made in various shapes, commonly round or square. 
Flavorings or seasonings, such as salt, herbs, seeds, and/or cheese, may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top before baking. Crackers are often branded as a nutritious and convenient way to consume a staple food or cereal grain. 
Crackers are eaten on their own or can accompany other food items, such as cheese or meat slices; dips; or soft spreads such as jam, butter, or peanut butter. Bland or mild crackers are sometimes used as a palate cleanser in food product testing or flavor testing, between samples. A precedent for the modern cracker can be found in nautical ship biscuits, military hardtack, and sacramental bread. 
Ancestors of the cracker can be found in ancient flatbreads, such as lavash, pita, matzo, flatbrød, and crisp bread. Asian analogues include papadum and senbei.

George Grenville (14 October 1712 – 13 November 1770) was a British Whig statesman who rose to the position of Prime Minister of Great Britain. Grenville was born into an influential political family and first entered Parliament in 1741 as an MP for Buckingham. He emerged as one of Cobham's Cubs, a group of young members of Parliament associated with Lord Cobham.
In 1754 Grenville became Treasurer of the Navy, a position he held twice until 1761. In October 1761 he chose to stay in government and accepted the new role of Leader of the Commons causing a rift with his brother-in-law and political ally William Pitt who had resigned. Grenville was subsequently made Northern Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute. 
On 8 April 1763, Lord Bute resigned, and Grenville assumed his position as Prime Minister.[tpl]cite web |url=http://britain.library4history.org/Andrews-Stuarts-Expansion/EXPANSION-OF-ENGLAND/John-Wilkes.html |title=Public Opinion and the House of Commons: John Wilkes |publisher=Library 4 History |work=A History of England, by Charles M. Andrews, Professor of History in Bryn Mawr College History |accessdate=28 October 2010[/tpl] His government tried to bring public spending under control and pursued an assertive foreign policy. His best known policy is the Stamp Act, a common tax in Great Britain onto the colonies in America, which provoked widespread opposition in Britain's American colonies and was later repealed. Grenville had increasingly strained relations with his colleagues and the King and in 1765 he was dismissed by George III and replaced by Lord Rockingham. For the last five years of his life Grenville led a group of his supporters in opposition and staged a public reconciliation with Pitt.

Richard Patrick Bennett OD, better known by the stage name Charlie Chaplin,Larkin, Colin: The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, 1998, ISBN 0-7535-0242-9 is a Jamaican dancehall and ragga deejay and singer. It was common for Jamaican deejays of the era to name themselves after film stars or characters. Bennett, however, had been nicknamed after the comedian since his youth. His career began in 1980 when he began working with U-Roy's Stur-Gav Hi-Fi collective. He became extremely popular throughout Jamaica, memorable for his focus on cultural and social themes instead of the "slack" (rough, violent) lyrics that were popular at the time. His popularity as a live performer prompted Roy Cousins to produce some recording sessions with the young DJ. Chaplin's debut album was the Cousins-produced Presenting Charlie Chaplin in 1982, with several albums following for the producer over the next three years. 
The contrast between Chaplin's "culture" lyrics and the other major deejays of the day led to the 1984 "clash" album with Yellowman Slackness Vs Pure Culture.
Que Dem (1985), was produced by George Phang and he continued recording, working with Bunny Roots, Josey Wales, Sly & Robbie, Henry "Junjo" Lawes, Roots Radics and Doctor Dread.
In 2013, Bennett was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government.Campbell, Howard (2013) "Honours in Order", Jamaica Observer, 7 August 2013. Retrieved 10 August 2013

The memory space was extended to 2GB and an RMCRead-Modify-write Cycle indicator, same as used on the MC68020 for multiprocessing support pin was added, in order to help the design of multiprocessor systems with virtual memory.DatasheetArchive :: Datasheet and Specsheet for MC68012RC12[ref]Avtar, Singh. 16-Bit and 32-Bit Microprocessors: Architecture, Software, and Interfacing Techniques. New Jersey. Englewood Cliffs. 1991
[/ref] All other features of the MC68010 were preserved.
The expansion of the memory space caused an issue for any programs that used the high byte of an address to store data, a programming trick that was successful with those processors that only have a 24-bit address bus (68000 and 68010). A similar problem affected the 68020.

[[Motorola 68008]]
CATEGORIES: 68k microprocessors

The Motorola 68008 is an 8/16/32-bit microprocessor made by Motorola.  It is a version of the Motorola 68000 with an 8-bit external data bus, as well as a smaller address bus.
The original 68000 (introduced in 1979) had a 24-bit address bus and a 16-bit data bus.  These relatively large buses made it hard to design a low-cost system around the 68000; they were difficult to lay out on a circuit board and needed a lot of supporting circuitry.  A 16-bit data bus also required twice as many memory chips as an 8-bit one.
The 68008, introduced in 1982, was designed to work with low-cost 8-bit memory systems.  Because of its smaller data bus, it was only about half as fast as a 68000 of the same clock speed.  However, it was still faster than competing 8-bit microprocessors, because the 68008's internal architecture was based around a 32-bit architecture.
Except for its smaller data and address buses, the 68008 behaved identically to the 68000 and had the same internal organization and microarchitecture.
The 68008 was an HMOS chip with about [tpl]nowrap|70 000 transistors;[/tpl] it came in 8 and [tpl]nowrap|10 MHz[/tpl] speed grades.  There were two distinct versions of the chip.  The original version came in a 48-pin dual in-line package and had a 20-bit address bus, allowing it to use up to 1 megabyte of memory.  A later version came in a 52-pin plastic leaded chip carrier; this version provided a 22-bit address bus and could support 4 megabytes of memory.
Very few computer systems used the 68008 as the main processor; the Sinclair QL personal computer is the best known of these.  However, the 68008 was popular in embedded systems.
Motorola ended production of the 68008 in 1996.comp.sys.m68k Usenet posting, May 16, 1995; also see other posts in thread.  The end-of-life announcement was in late 1994; according to standard Motorola end-of-life practice, final orders would have been in 1995, with final shipments in 1996.

The elementary charge, usually denoted as e or sometimes q, is the electric charge carried by a single proton, or equivalently, the negation (opposite) of the electric charge carried by a single electron.Note that the symbol e has many other meanings. Somewhat confusingly, in atomic physics, e sometimes denotes the electron charge, i.e. the negative of the elementary charge. This elementary charge is a fundamental physical constant. To avoid confusion over its sign, e is sometimes called the elementary positive charge.

Super Bowl XXXVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Oakland Raiders and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2002 season. The Buccaneers defeated the Raiders by the score of 48–21, winning their first ever Super Bowl. The game, played on January 26, 2003 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California, was the fifth Super Bowl to be held a week after the conference championship games. It was also the last Super Bowl to have been played in the month of January. Super Bowl XXXVI was the first to be played in February, due to the NFL postponing games for a week after the September 11 attacks. Starting with Super Bowl XXXVIII, the Super Bowl has been permanently played in February.
It was the first time in Super Bowl history that the league's #1 ranked offense (Raiders) was pitted against the league's #1 ranked defense (Buccaneers). However, the game is sometimes referred to as the "Gruden Bowl", because the primary storyline surrounding the game revolved around Jon Gruden.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/super/2003-01-27-ratings_x.htm|publisher=USATODAY.com|title=Gruden Bowl' keeps fans glued to TVs|newspaper=USA Today|date=January 27, 2003|first=Rudy|last=Martzke[/tpl] Gruden was the Raiders' head coach from 1998 to 2001, and then became the Buccaneers coach in 2002. Tampa Bay, "Gruden's new team", entered their first Super Bowl in team history after posting a 12–4 regular season record. Oakland, "Gruden's old team", advanced to their fifth Super Bowl after posting an 11–5 regular season record.  This was also the first Super Bowl to feature two former division rivals, as the Buccaneers and Raiders both played in the AFC West in 1976.
The Raiders came into the game as four-point favorites. However, aided with Gruden's prior knowledge of his old team, the Tampa Bay defense dominated the contest. Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon threw a Super Bowl record five interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The Buccaneers also sacked Gannon five times, and scored 34 unanswered points to build a 34–3 lead late in the third quarter. Tampa Bay safety Dexter Jackson, who had two of those interceptions and returned them for 34 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Jackson became only the second safety and third defensive back to ever be named Super Bowl MVP.
The attendance of 67,603 was the third-smallest ever for a Super Bowl game; only Super Bowl I (61,946) and Super Bowl XXVI (63,130) had fewer attendees.

[[Ossuary]]

CATEGORIES: Ossuaries

An ossuary is a chest, box, building, well, or site made to serve as the final resting place of human skeletal remains. They are frequently used where burial space is scarce. A body is first buried in a temporary grave, then after some years the skeletal remains are removed and placed in an ossuary. The greatly reduced space taken up by an ossuary means that it is possible to store the remains of many more people in a single tomb than if the original coffins were left as is.

[[Light-on-dark color scheme]]
CATEGORIES: User interfaces, Display technology, Colour schemes, Color, Computer graphics

A light-on-dark color scheme is a color scheme that uses light-colored text on a dark background and is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design. 
Originally, computer user interface images were formed on CRTs. The phosphor was normally a very dark color, and lit up brightly when the electron beam hit it, appearing to be green or amber on black, depending on phosphors applied on a monochrome screen. RGB screens continued along a similar vein, using all the beams set to "on" to form white.
With the advent of teletext, research was done into which primary and secondary light colors and combinations worked best for this new medium. [tpl]Fact|date=September 2008[/tpl]  From a palette of black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white, it turned out that cyan or yellow on black was typically found to be optimal.
The opposite color scheme, dark-on-light color scheme, was originally introduced in WYSIWYG word processors, to simulate ink on paper. 
There seems to be a dispute among vision and perception researchers about whether it is actually easier or healthier to read text on dark or light background; there is a similar dispute between users, when using each other's computer terminals.

Their music combines a "danceable ska and rocksteady beat with punk's energy and attitude", and had a "more focused and informed political and social stance" than other ska groups. The band wore mod-style "1960s period rude boy outfits (pork pie hats, tonic and mohair suits, and loafers)."[tpl]cite web|last=Woodstra |first=Chris |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5495|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Allmusic.com |publisher=Allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2010[/tpl] In 1980, the song "Too Much Too Young", the lead track on their The Special AKA Live!

After seven consecutive UK Top 10 singles between 1979 and 1981, several members of the group abruptly left to form the Fun Boy Three.  Continuing on as "The Special AKA" (a name they used frequently on earlier Specials releases), a substantially revised Specials lineup issued new material through 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single "(Free) Nelson Mandela".  Afterwards, founder and songwriter Jerry Dammers dissolved the band and pursued political activism.

Daryl Hall & John Oates, known more commonly as Hall & Oates, is an American musical duo from Philadelphia.
Daryl Hall is the lead vocalist of the pairing, and also plays a wide range of musical instruments.  John Oates primarily plays electric guitar and provides backing vocals, but also contributes other instruments in recordings and live performances.  The two also write most of the songs they perform, either separately or in collaboration.  They achieved their greatest fame from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with a fusion of rock and roll and rhythm and blues, which they dubbed "rock and soul." Critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and J. Scott McClintock write,[tpl]cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist |id=p4427 |pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Hall & Oates |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13[/tpl] "at their best, Hall & Oates' songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them by incorporating elements of new wave." While much of their reputation is due to the sustained pop-chart run in the 1980s, they continue to record and tour, and remain respected by various artists for their ability to cross stylistic boundaries.
They are best known for their six No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: "Rich Girl", "Kiss on My List", "Private Eyes", "I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)", "Maneater", and "Out of Touch", as well as many other songs which charted in the Top 40.

The Czochralski process is a method of crystal growth used to obtain single crystals of semiconductors (e.g. silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide), metals (e.g. palladium, platinum, silver, gold), salts and synthetic gemstones. The process is named after Polish scientist Jan Czochralski,(Polish), (English), Paweł Tomaszewski, ""Jan Czochralski i jego metoda" (ang.Jan Czochralski and his method), Oficyna Wydawnicza ATUT, Wrocław–Kcynia 2003, ISBN 83-89247-27-5 who invented the method in 1916 while investigating the crystallization rates of metals.J. Czochralski (1918) "Ein neues Verfahren zur Messung der Kristallisationsgeschwindigkeit der Metalle" new method for the measurement of the crystallization rate of metals, Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie, 92 :  219–221.
The most important application may be the growth of large cylindrical ingots, or boules, of single crystal silicon. Other semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, can also be grown by this method, although lower defect densities in this case can be obtained using variants of the Bridgman-Stockbarger technique.

Bonampak is an ancient Maya archaeological site in the Mexican state of Chiapas.  The site is approximately [tpl]convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the larger site of Yaxchilan, under which Bonampak was a dependency, and the border with Guatemala.  While the site is not overly impressive in terms of spatial or architectural size, it is well known for a number of murals, most especially those located within Structure 1 (The Temple of the Murals). The construction of the site’s structures dates to the Early Classic period (c. AD 580 to 800). In addition to being amongst the most well-preserved Maya murals, the Bonampak murals are noteworthy for debunking early assumptions that the Maya were a peaceful culture of mystics, as the murals clearly depict war and human sacrifice. 
The site, lying close to a tributary of the Usumacinta River, was first seen by non-Mayans in 1946. Precisely who was first is a matter of speculation, but it was either by two American travelers, Herman Charles (Carlos) Frey and John Bourne, or photographer/explorer Giles Healey. The Americans were led to the ruins by the local Lacandon Maya who still visited the site to pray in the ancient temples.  Giles Healey was the first to be shown the huge paintings covering the walls of one of the structure's three rooms. The paintings show the story of a single battle and its victorious outcome.

Munch Museum (Munch-museet) is an art museum in Oslo, Norway dedicated to the life and works of the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch.Munch Museum (Oslo Norway Tourist Information and Travel Guide)
The museum was financed from the profits generated by the Oslo municipal cinemas and opened its doors in 1963 to commemorate what would have been Munch's 100th birthday.  Its collection consists of works and articles by Munch, which he donated to the municipality of Oslo upon his death, and additional works donated by his sister Inger Munch, as well as various other works obtained through trades of duplicate prints, etc.
The museum now has in its permanent collection well over half of the artist's entire production of paintings and at least one copy of all his prints.  This amounts to over 1,200 paintings, 18,000 prints, six sculptures, as well as 500 plates, 2,240 books, and various other items. The museum also contains educational and conservation sections and also has facilities for performing arts.Munch Museum (artnoir)
The museum structure was designed by the architects Einar Myklebust and Gunnar Fougner (1911–1995).  Myklebust also played an important role in the expansion and renovation of the museum in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of Munch's death. This site has also been the location of filming for an Olsenbanden-movie from 1984. The City of Oslo promoted an architectural competition for a new Munch Museum in the area of Bjørvika, a new urban development were the Oslo Opera House is also located. The new museum will probably be completed in 2017 by the Spanish studio Herreros Arquitectos.Munch-museet (Store norske leksikon)Gunnar Fougner (Store norske leksikon)

Viking ships were marine vessels of particular designs used and built by the Vikings during the Viking Age. The boat-types were quite varied, depending on what the ship was intended for, but they were generally characterized as being slender and flexible boats, with symmetrical ends with true keel. They were clinker built, which is the overlapping of planks riveted together. Some might have had a dragon's head or other circular object protruding from the bow and stern, for design, although this is only inferred from historical sources.
They ranged in the Baltic Sea and far from the Scandinavian homelands, to Iceland,  the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Newfoundland, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and Africa.

Man of Aran is a 1934 British fictional documentary (ethnofiction) film directed by Robert J. Flaherty about life on the Aran Islands off the western coast of Ireland. It portrays characters living in premodern conditions, documenting their daily routines such as fishing off high cliffs, farming potatoes where there is little soil, and hunting for huge basking sharks to get liver oil for lamps. Some situations are fabricated, such as one scene in which the shark fishermen are almost lost at sea in a sudden gale. Additionally, the family members shown are not actually related, having been chosen from among the islanders for their photogenic qualities.
George Stoney's 1978 documentary How the Myth was Made, which is included in the special features of the DVD, relates that the Aran Islanders had not hunted sharks in this way for over fifty years at the time the film was made. Man of Aran is Flaherty's re-creation of culture on the edges of modern society, even though much of the primitive life depicted had been left behind by the 1930s. It is impressive, however, for its drama, for its spectacular cinematography of landscape and seascape, and for its concise editing.
The UK rock band British Sea Power was asked to record a new soundtrack for the film's 2009 DVD release, performing the score at a series of live events in the UK including one accompanying the film itself at the British Film Institute.British Sea Power Soundtrack. 'Man of Aran' nears release, ClashMusic.com, 23 January 2009. Accessed online 8 April 2009.
The film won the Mussolini Cup for best foreign film at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival.
Flaherty's legacy is subject of the 2010 British Universities Film & Video Council award-winning and FOCAL International award-nominated documentary '"A Boatload of Wild Irishmen", written by Professor Brian Winston of University of Lincoln, UK, and directed by Mac Dara Ó Curraidhín. In the staged climactic sequence of Man of Aran, Flaherty said he'd been accused of "trying to drown a boatload of wild Irishmen".

[[Tribalism]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of government, Social psychology, Political science theories, Sociological terminology, Tribes

Tribalism is the state of being organized in, or advocating for, a tribe or tribes. In terms of conformity, tribalism may also refer in popular cultural terms to a way of thinking or behaving in which people are more loyal to their tribe than to their friends, their country, or any other social group.http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tribalism?q=tribalism Definition of tribalism;  http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/tribalism Definition of tribalism by Macmillan dictionary]
Tribalism has been defined in engaged theory as a 'formation of being' based upon variable combinations of kinship-based organization, reciprocal exchange, manual production, oral communication, and analogical enquiry.[tpl]cite book |last=James |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 |year=2006 |publisher= Sage Publications |location=London[/tpl] Ontologically, it is oriented around the valences of analogy, genealogy and mythology.
The social structure of a tribe can vary greatly from case to case, but, due to the small size of tribes, it is usually involves a relatively undifferentiated role structure, with few significant political or economic distinctions between individuals.[tpl]cite book|author=Max Gluckman|editor1=Robert A. Manners|editor2=David Kaplan|title=Anthropological Theory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s1gRZA9N7QYC|year=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-202-36133-8|pages=453–464|chapter=Social beliefs and individual Thinking in Tribal Society |chapterurl=http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=s1gRZA9N7QYC&pg=PA453[/tpl]
Tribalism implies the possession of a strong cultural or ethnic identity that separates one member of a group from the members of another group.  Based on strong relations of proximity and kinship, members of a tribe tend to possess a strong feeling of identity. Objectively, for a customary tribal society to form there needs to be ongoing social organization and exchange. However, subjectively, intense feelings of common identity lead people to feel tribally connected.[tpl]cite book|author1=Kanakasena Dekā|author2=Kanakasena Ḍekā|title=Assam's Crisis: Myth & Reality|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W8-zUe6RpfUC|year=1993|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-473-2|pages=90[/tpl] The distinction between these two definitions for tribalism is an important one because, while tribal society no longer strictly exists in the western world, tribalism, by this second definition, is arguably undiminished. People have postulated that the human brain is hard-wired towards tribalism due to its evolutionary advantages.[tpl]cite book|author1=Erich Fromm|author2=Michael MacCoby|title=Social Character in a Mexican Village|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vnXCf7iGXQUC|year=1970|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-876-7|pages=xi[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/mode/style-secrets-of-the-gangs|title=STYLE SECRETS OF THE GANGS : The truth behind tribal fashion|work=MODE|publisher=shortlist.com[/tpl]  See Tribalism and evolution below.
Many tribes refer to themselves with their language's word for "people," while referring to other, neighboring tribes with various epithets. For example, the term "Inuit" translates as "people," but they were known to the Ojibwe by a name 'Eskimo' translating roughly as "eaters of raw meat."[tpl]cite book|author1=Karen Lowther|author2=Evan-Moor Educational Publishers|title=Native Americans: Grades 1-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rks-jTuBlEAC|year=2003|publisher=Evan-Moor|isbn=978-1-55799-901-6|pages=14[/tpl]

[[Telemark skiing]]
CATEGORIES: Telemark skiing, Types of skiing

Telemark skiing (also known as "free heel skiing") is a form of downhill skiing using bindings where the boot is attached only at the toe (similar to those of cross-country skiing), allowing the heel to come up from the ski. Because the heel is free, it allows the skier to go into a strided position at the end of a turn. This movement of the legs past each other from turn to turn is a technique called the Telemark turn.
Telemark turns are led with the heel flat on the outside ski (which becomes the downhill ski at the end of the turn) with the knee at a 90-degree angle. The inside (and uphill) ski slides back under the skier's body with a flexed knee and raised heel. This ski position can be clearly seen in ski jumping, where the "Telemark position" is part of the requirements of a successful jump. The skis are staggered but not quite parallel, and the downhill ski is pushed forward by the skier’s lunge.Krcmar, S. (2006). Fast track to Telemark skiing. Men’s Fitness, 22(9), 54.  Normally 50% to 60% of the body weight is distributed on the outside ski, depending on snow conditions.
The Telemark turn came to the attention of the Norwegian public in 1868, when Sondre Norheim took part in a ski jumping competition.  Norheim's technique of fluid turns soon dominated skiing, and in Norway it continued to do well into the next century.Blikom, A., & Molde, E. (n.d.). Sondre in the history of skiing. Sondre Norheim - the skiing pioneer of Telemark. Retrieved November 25, 2012, from http://www.sondrenorheim.com/history.htm  Starting in the 1910s, newer techniques based on the stem gradually replaced Telemark in the Alpine countries. Newer techniques were easier to master and enabled shorter turns better suited for steeper alpine terrain and skiing downhill.  The Telemark turn became the technique of ski touring in rolling terrain.
The technique is named after the Telemark region of Norway, just as the stem Christie turn was named after Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. As well as inventing the Telemark turn, Sondre Norheim and his fellow skiers used and refined Alpine skiing techniques. Thus, while the Telemark is part of early skiing's foundation, Alpine techniques are of equal importance.

Morgedal, Norway is a village whose most famous residents were Sondre Norheim, known to be the father of modern skiing, Torjus Hemmestveit, and Mikkjel Hemmestveit. The Hemmestveit brothers created the world's first skiing school at Christiania, Norway in 1881 before emigrating to the United States in the late 19th century.
The Olympic Flames for the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo and the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, and the flame used in the national torch relay for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer (which was later used as the flame for the 1994 Winter Paralympics), were all lit at the birthplace of Sondre Norheim, Øvrebø in Morgedal.

The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is an annual long-distance sled dog race run in early March from Anchorage to Nome.  Mushers and a team of 16 dogs, of which at least 6 must be on the towline at the finish line, cover the distance in 9–15 days or more.[tpl]cite web |url = http://d3r6t1k4mqz5i.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012_rules.pdf | title = Official Rules 2012 |publisher = Iditarod Trail Committee, Inc |accessdate = 2012-02-28 | format = PDF[/tpl] The Iditarod began in 1973 as an event to test the best sled dog mushers and teams but evolved into today's highly competitive race. The current fastest winning time record was set in 2014 by Dallas Seavey with a time of 8 days, 13 hours, 4 minutes, and 19 seconds.[tpl]cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/10587637/dallas-seavey-wins-second-iditarod-dog-race |title = Dallas Seavey Wins Iditarod In Dramatic Fashion |accessdate = 2014-03-11[/tpl] As of 2012, Dallas Seavey was also the youngest musher to win the race at the age of 25, while as of 2013, at the age of 53, Mitch Seavey was the oldest person to ever win the race.
Teams generally race through blizzards causing whiteout conditions, sub-zero temperatures and gale-force winds which can cause the wind chill to reach [tpl]convert|-100|°F|°C[/tpl].  A ceremonial start occurs in the city of Anchorage and is followed by the official restart in Willow, a city in the south central region of the state. The restart was originally in Wasilla, but because of too little snow, the restart was permanently moved to Willow in 2008.[tpl]cite web |url = http://dwb.adn.com/news/alaska/matsu/story/8667081p-8559265c.html |title = Iditarod restart |accessdate = September 24, 2008 |author = Anchorage daily news[/tpl] The trail runs from Willow up the Rainy Pass of the Alaska Range into the sparsely populated interior, and then along the shore of the Bering Sea, finally reaching Nome in western Alaska. The trail is through a harsh landscape of tundra and spruce forests, over hills and mountain passes, and across rivers.  While the start in Anchorage is in the middle of a large urban center, most of the route passes through widely separated towns and villages, and small Athabaskan and Inupiat settlements. The Iditarod is regarded as a symbolic link to the early history of the state and is connected to many traditions commemorating the legacy of dog mushing.
The race is the most popular sporting event in Alaska, and the top mushers and their teams of dogs are local celebrities; this popularity is credited with the resurgence of recreational mushing in the state since the 1970s. While the yearly field of more than fifty mushers and about a thousand dogs is still largely Alaskan, competitors from fourteen countries have completed the event including the Swiss Martin Buser, who became the first international winner in 1992.
The Iditarod received more attention outside of the state after the 1985 victory of Libby Riddles, a long shot who became the first woman to win the race. Susan Butcher became the second woman to win the race and went on to win three more years. Print and television journalists and crowds of spectators attend the ceremonial start at the intersection of Fourth Avenue and D Street in Anchorage and in smaller numbers at the checkpoints along the trail.

[[Cremation]]
CATEGORIES: Cremation, Death customs, Incineration, Fire

Cremation is the use of high-temperature burning, vaporization, and oxidation to reduce dead animal or human bodies to basic chemical compounds, such as gases and mineral fragments retaining the appearance of dry bone.[tpl]cite journal| last=Matthews Cremation Division| title=Cremation Equipment Operator Training Program| pages=1| year=2006[/tpl]
Cremation may serve as a funeral or post-funeral rite that is an alternative to the interment of an intact dead body in a coffin or casket. Cremated remains, which do not constitute a health risk, may be buried or interred in memorial sites or cemeteries, or they may be retained by relatives and dispersed in various ways. Cremation is not an alternative to a funeral, but rather an alternative to burial or other forms of disposal.
In many countries, cremation is usually done in a crematorium. Some countries prefer different methods, such as open-air cremation in India and in Nepal.

Basil of Caesarea, also called Saint Basil the Great, (329 or 330Fedwick (1981), p. 5 – January 1, 379) ([tpl]lang-el|Ἅγιος Βασίλειος ὁ Μέγας[/tpl]) was the Greek bishop of Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia, Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). He was an influential theologian who supported the Nicene Creed and opposed the heresies of the early Christian church, fighting against both Arianism and the followers of Apollinaris of Laodicea. His ability to balance his theological convictions with his political connections made Basil a powerful advocate for the Nicene position.
In addition to his work as a theologian, Basil was known for his care of the poor and underprivileged. Basil established guidelines for monastic life which focus on community life, liturgical prayer, and manual labour. Together with Pachomius he is remembered as a father of communal monasticism in Eastern Christianity. He is considered a saint by the traditions of both Eastern and Western Christianity.
Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa are collectively referred to as the Cappadocian Fathers. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches have given him, together with Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom, the title of Great Hierarch. He is recognised as a Doctor of the Church in both Eastern Orthodoxy and in the Roman Catholic Church. He is sometimes referred to by the epithet "Ουρανοφαντωρ", "revealer of heavenly mysteries".[ref]

The European Southern Observatory (ESO, formally the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere; Observatoire européen austral in French) is a 15-nation intergovernmental research organisation for astronomy. Created in 1962, ESO has provided astronomers with state-of-the-art research facilities and access to the southern sky. The organisation employs about 730 staff members and receives annual member state contributions of approximately €143 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/about-eso.html | title = About ESO | accessdate = 2011-04-28[/tpl] Its observatories are located in northern Chile.
ESO has built and operated some of the largest and most technologically-advanced telescopes in the world. These include the New Technology Telescope (NTT) (which pioneered active optics technology) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which consists of four 8-metre-class telescopes and four 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes. Ongoing ESO projects include the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
ALMA is a facility for observation of the universe in the millimetre and submillimetre wavelength ranges, and is the largest ground-based astronomy project extant. It was completed in March 2013. The ALMA project is an international collaboration by Europe (represented by ESO), East Asia, North America and Chile.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en | title = ALMA website | accessdate = 2011-09-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/alma/ | title = Welcome to ALMA! | accessdate = 2011-05-25[/tpl]
The E-ELT is a 40-metre class telescope in the detailed design phase, and will be the world's largest optical near-infrared telescope.

Maximilian Steiner (August 28, 1839 – May 29, 1880) was an Austrian actor and theater manager.
Steiner was manager of Vienna's Theater an der Wien from 1869 to 1875 with Marie Geistinger, a Viennese actress, and from 1875 to 1880 on his own. During this period, he is said to have discovered Johann Strauss, and encouraged Jacques Offenbach to drop a lucrative conducting career to write his first operetta.[ref]
 Note: citing the summary of Maximilian in grandson's article.[/ref] Steiner gradually phased out spoken-word dramas from the Theater program, contributing to the Viennese opera boom.
Steiner was born in Ofen, near Budapest in Hungary, and died in Baden, Lower Austria. He had two sons: Franz Steiner, who took over his function in 1880 and remained until 1884; and Gabor Steiner, who also became a theatre manager and operator of a music hall. He was grandfather of Max Steiner, a Hollywood film composer.

In computer networking, IntServ or integrated services is an architecture that specifies the elements to guarantee quality of service (QoS) on networks. IntServ can for example be used to allow video and sound to reach the receiver without interruption.
IntServ specifies a fine-grained QoS system, which is often contrasted with DiffServ's coarse-grained control system.
The idea of IntServ is that every router in the system implements IntServ, and every application that requires some kind of guarantees has to make an individual reservation. Flow Specs describe what the reservation is for, while RSVP is the underlying mechanism to signal it across the network.

The Act of Uniformity 1662 (14 Car 2 c 4) was an Act of the Parliament of England. It is also cited as 13 & 14 Ch.2 c. 4,The '16 Charles II c. 2' nomenclature is reference to the statute book of the numbered year of the reign of the named King in the stated chapter. This is the method used for Acts of Parliament from before 1962. 19 May 1662. It prescribed the form of public prayers, administration of sacraments, and other rites of the Established Church of England, following all the rites and ceremonies and doctrines prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer. Adherence to this was required in order to hold any office in government or the church, although the edition of the Book of Common Prayer prescribed by the Act (1662) was so new that most people had never even seen a copy.  It also required episcopal ordination for all ministers, which was reintroduced after the Puritans had abolished many features of the Church during the Civil War.

The Five Mile Act, or Oxford Act, or Nonconformists Act 1665, is an Act of the Parliament of England (17 Charles II c. 2), passed in 1665 with the long title "An Act for restraining Non-Conformists from inhabiting in Corporations". It was one of the English penal laws that sought to enforce conformity to the established Church of England, and to expel any who did not conform. It forbade clergymen from living within five miles (8 km) of a parish from which they had been expelled, unless they swore an oath never to resist the king, or attempt to alter the government of Church or State.  The latter involved swearing to obey the 1662 prayer book.  Thousands of ministers were deprived under this act.

[[Pseudohistory]]
CATEGORIES: Articles with inconsistent citation formats, Pseudohistory, Fringe theory

Pseudohistory is a pejorative term applied to a type of historical revisionism.  It purports to be history, and uses ostensibly-scholarly methods and techniques (which in fact depart from standard historiographical conventions), but is inconsistent with established facts or with common sense and often involves sensational claims whose acceptance would significantly require rewriting accepted history.  The term may apply to a theory or to a work or works based on that theory. Cryptohistory is a related term, sometimes applied to pseudo-historical publications based on occult notions.
The pejorative nature of the term arises from the implication of ignorance, deliberate misrepresentation, carelessness, gullibility or poor scholarship on the part of the (pseudo)historian.

[[Rhizome]]

CATEGORIES: Plant anatomy, Plant reproduction, Plant physiology

In botany and dendrology, a rhizome (from [tpl]lang-grc|rhízōma[/tpl] "mass of roots",[tpl]LSJ|r(I/zwma|ῥίζωμα|ref[/tpl] from [tpl]lang|grc|rhizóō[/tpl] "cause to strike root")[tpl]LSJ|r(izo/w|ῥιζόω[/tpl] is a modified subterranean stem of a plant that is usually found underground, often sending out roots and shoots from its nodes. Rhizomes may also be referred to as creeping rootstalks or rootstocks. Rhizomes develop from axillary buds and are diageotropic or grow perpendicular to the force of gravity. The rhizome also retains the ability to allow new shoots to grow upwards.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jang|first=Cheol Seong|coauthors=et al.|title=Functional classification, genomic organization, putatively cis-acting regulatory elements, and relationship to quantitative trait loci, of sorghum genes with rhizome-enriched expression.|journal=Plant Physiology|year=2006|volume=142|issue=3|pages=1148–1159|doi=10.1104/pp.106.082891[/tpl]
If a rhizome is separated into pieces, each piece may be able to give rise to a new plant. The plant uses the rhizome to store starches, proteins, and other nutrients. These nutrients become useful for the plant when new shoots must be formed or when the plant dies back for the winter. This is a process known as vegetative reproduction and is used by farmers and gardeners to propagate certain plants. This also allows for lateral spread of grasses like bamboo and bunch grasses. Examples of plants that are propagated this way include hops, asparagus, ginger, irises, Lily of the Valley, Cannas, and sympodial orchids. Some rhizomes are used directly in cooking, including ginger, turmeric, galangal, and fingerroot.
Stored rhizomes are subject to bacterial and fungal infections making them unsuitable for replanting and greatly diminishing stocks. However rhizomes can also be produced artificially from tissue cultures. The ability to easily grow rhizomes from tissue cultures leads to better stocks for replanting and greater yields.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nayak|first=Sanghamitra|coauthors=Pradeep Kumar Naik|title=Factors effecting in vitro microrhizome formation and growth in Curcuma longa L. and improved field performance of micropropagated plants |journal= Science Asia|year=2006|volume=32|pages=31–37[/tpl] The plant hormones ethylene and jasmonic acid have been found to help induce and regulate the growth of rhizomes, specifically in Rheum rabarbarum (rhubarb). Ethylene that was applied externally was found to affect internal ethylene levels, allowing for easy manipulations of ethylene concentrations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rayirath|first=Usha P|coauthors=et al.|title=Role of ethylene and jasmonic acid on rhizome induction and growth in rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum L.) |journal=Plant Cell Tissue Organ Culture|year=2011|volume=105|pages=253–263|doi=10.1007/s11240-010-9861-y[/tpl] Knowledge of how to use these hormones to induce rhizome growth could help farmers and biologists producing plants grown from rhizomes more easily cultivate and grow better plants.
The poplars (Populus) are an example of trees that propagate using a rhizome.  The Pando colony in Utah is a famous example, which has been living for about 80,000 years. The rhizome of a poplar colony is the key to its longevity: foragers, insects, fungus, and forest fires may destroy the above-ground portion of the tree, but the underground rhizome is somewhat protected against these threats.
A stolon is similar to a rhizome, but, unlike a rhizome, which is the main stem of the plant, a stolon sprouts from an existing stem, has long internodes, and generates new shoots at the end, such as in the strawberry plant. In general, rhizomes have short internodes; they send out roots from the bottom of the nodes and new upward-growing shoots from the top of the nodes. A stem tuber is a thickened part of a rhizome or stolon that has been enlarged for use as a storage organ.Stern, Kingsley R. Introductory Plant Biology, 10th ed., McGraw Hill, 2002. ISBN 0-07-290941-2 In general, a tuber is high in starch, for example, the common potato, which is a modified stolon. The term tuber is often used imprecisely, and is sometimes applied to plants with rhizomes.
Some plants have rhizomes that grow above ground or that lie at the soil surface, including some Iris species, and ferns, whose spreading stems are rhizomes. Plants with underground rhizomes include gingers, bamboo, the Venus Flytrap, Chinese lantern, Western poison-oak,Hogan, C. Michael (2008) "Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum", GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg hops, and Alstroemeria, and the weeds Johnson grass, bermuda grass, and purple nut sedge. Rhizomes generally form a single layer, but in Giant Horsetails, can be multi-tiered.Husby, C. (2003) "Ecology and Physiology of the Giant Horsetails", Florida International University

Edmund Gerald "Jerry" Brown, Jr. (born April 7, 1938) is an American politician who currently serves as the 39th Governor of California since 2011; he previously served as California's 34th Governor[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_5 |title=California Constitution, Article V, Section II |accessdate=2011-01-10[/tpl] from 1975 to 1983. Both before and after his original two terms as Governor, Brown served in numerous state, local, and party positions. He was a member of the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees (1969–1971), Secretary of State of California (1971–1975), chairman of the California Democratic Party (1989–1991), Mayor of Oakland (1999–2007) and Attorney General of California (2007–2011).
Brown sought the Democratic nominations for President of the United States in 1976, 1980, and 1992, and was the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in California in 1982, but was unsuccessful in those attempts. He is the son of Pat Brown, the 32nd Governor of California. On October 7, 2013, he became the longest-serving governor in California history measured by cumulative service.
As a consequence of the 28-year gap between his second and third terms, Brown has been both the sixth-youngest California governor (and the youngest since the 1860s) and the oldest California governor in history.

[[Praemunire]]

CATEGORIES: Legal history of England, Crimes, Latin legal terms, English legal terms, Medieval English law, Common law offences in England and Wales

In English history, Praemunire or Praemunire facias was a law which prohibited the assertion or maintenance of papal jurisdiction, imperial or foreign, or some other alien jurisdiction or claim of supremacy in England, against the supremacy of the monarch. This law was enforced by the Writ of Praemunire facias, a writ of summons from which the law takes its name.
The name Praemunire may denote the statute, the writ, or the offence.
Praemunire in classical Latin means to fortify. In medieval Latin, praemunire was confused with and used for praemonere, to forewarn, as the writ commanded that the sheriff do (facias) warn (praemunire) the summoned person to appear before the Court.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. praemunire.

Incense is composed of aromatic plant materials, often combined with essential oils.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=7M9_cYNE0X4C&pg=PA15&dq=Incense+Composition&cd=2#v=onepage&q=Incense%20Composition |title=Cunningham's Encyclopedia of magical herbs|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=2000|isbn=0-87542-122-9[/tpl] The forms taken by incense differ with the underlying culture, and have changed with advances in technology and increasing diversity in the reasons for burning it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oller.net/incense-making.htm|title=Making Incense|author=David Oller[/tpl] Incense can generally be separated into two main types: "indirect-burning" and "direct-burning". Indirect-burning incense (or "non-combustible incense") is not capable of burning on its own, and requires a separate heat source. Direct-burning incense (or "combustible incense") is lit directly by a flame and then fanned or blown out, leaving a glowing ember that smoulders and releases fragrance. Direct-burning incense is either a paste formed around a bamboo stick, or a paste that is extruded into a stick or cone shape.

The first part of the story concentrates on his romantic life, and in the second, he and others' internal agony is depicted. He appears from the first volume "Kiritsubo" to the 40th volume "Illusion".
"Genji" is the surname as a noble demoted from royalty. His true given name is never referred to in the story, like most other characters. "Hikaru" means "shining", which is a
nickname deriving from his appearance. He is also referred to in the book as [tpl]Nihongo|Rokujō no In|六条院[/tpl], sometimes abbreviated as [tpl]Nihongo|In|院[/tpl]. He is often called Genji when speaking of the story.
He is a fictitious person but it is thought the author was inspired by some historical figures, including Minamoto no Tōru, who was a grandson of Emperor Saga, hence one of the Saga Genji clan.

The Test Acts were a series of English penal laws that served as a religious test for public office and imposed various civil disabilities on Roman Catholics and Nonconformists. The principle was that none but people professing the Established Church were eligible for public employment, and the severe penalties pronounced against recusants, whether Catholic or Nonconformist, were affirmations of this principle.

The Mesoamerican ballgame or Ōllamaliztli [tpl]IPA-nah|oːlːamaˈlistɬi[/tpl]  in Nahuatl was a sport with ritual associations played since 1,400 B.C.See Hill, Blake and Clark (1998); Schuster (1998). by the pre-Columbian peoples of Ancient Mexico and Central America. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a  newer more modern version of the game, ulama, is still played in a few places by the indigenous population.Fox, John. ''The ball : discovering the object of the game", 1st ed., New York : Harper, 2012. ISBN 9780061881794. Cf. Chapter 4: "Sudden Death in the New World" about the Ulama game.
The rules of Ōllamaliztli are not known, but judging from its descendant, ulama, they were probably similar to racquetball,Schwartz. where the aim is to keep the ball in play.  The stone ballcourt goals (see photo to right) are a late addition to the game.
In the most widespread version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions allowed the use of forearms, rackets, bats, or handstones.  The ball was made of solid rubber and weighed as much as 4 kg (9 lbs), and sizes differed greatly over time or according to the version played.
The game had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events, often featuring human sacrifice. The sport was also played casually for recreation by children and perhaps even women.The primary evidence for female ballplayers is in the many apparently female figurines of the Formative period, wearing a ballplayer loincloth and perhaps other gear.  In The Sport of Life and Death, editor Michael Whittington says: "It would therefore seem reasonable that women also played the game—perhaps in all-female teams—or participated in some yet to be understood ceremony enacted on the ballcourt." (p. 186).  In the same volume, Gillett Griffin states that although these figurines have been "interpreted by some as females, in the context of ancient Mesoamerican society the question of the presence of female ballplayers, and their role in the game, is still debated." (p. 158).
Pre-Columbian ballcourts have been found throughout Mesoamerica, as far south as Nicaragua, and possibly as far north as what is now the U.S. state of Arizona.The evidence for ballcourts among the Hohokam is not accepted by all researchers and even the proponents admit that the proposed Hohokam ballcourts are significantly different from Mesoamerican ones: they are oblong, with a concave (not flat) surface.  See Wilcox's article and photo at end of this article. These ballcourts vary considerably in size, but all have long narrow alleys with side-walls against which the balls could bounce.

[[Relational algebra]]

CATEGORIES: Relational model

In Data Management, relational algebra describes the how data is naturally organized into sets of data, aptly so as data is the documentation of a real life person, place or thing and the events or transactions between them at a point in time. Relational algebra, first described by E.F. Codd while at IBM, is a family of algebra with a well-founded semantics used for modelling the data stored in relational databases, and defining queries on it. 
To organize the data, first the redundant data and repeating groups of data are removed, which we call normalized. By doing this the data is organized or normalized into what is called first normal form (1NF).   Typically a logical data model documents and standardizes the  relationships between data entities (with its elements).  A primary key uniquely identifies an instance of an entity, also known as a record. 
Once the data is normalized and in sets of data (entities and tables), the main operations of the relational algebra can be performed which are the set operations (such as union, intersection, and cartesian product), selection (keeping only some lines of a table) and the projection (keeping only some columns). Set operations are performed in the where statement in SQL, which is where one set of data is related to another set of data. 
The main application of relational algebra is providing a theoretical foundation for relational databases, particularly query languages for such databases, chief among which is SQL.

[[Tuple relational calculus]]

CATEGORIES: Relational model, Logical calculi

Tuple calculus is a calculus that was introduced by Edgar F. Codd as part of the relational model, in order to provide a declarative database-query language for this data model. It formed the inspiration for the database-query languages QUEL and SQL, of which the latter, although far less faithful to the original relational model and calculus, is now the de-facto-standard database-query language; a dialect of SQL is used by nearly every relational-database-management system. Lacroix and Pirotte proposed domain calculus, which is closer to first-order logic and which showed that both of these calculi (as well as relational algebra) are equivalent in expressive power. Subsequently, query languages for the relational model were called relationally complete if they could express at least all of these queries.

CATEGORIES: Maya sites in Belize, Cayo District, Former populated places in Belize, Classic period in Mesoamerica

Caracol is the name given to a large ancient Maya archaeological site, located in what is now the Cayo District of  Belize. It is situated approximately 40 kilometres south of Xunantunich and the town of San Ignacio Cayo, and 15 kilometers away from the Macal River. It rests on the Vaca Plateau at an elevation of 500 meters above sea-level, in the foothills of the Maya Mountains.Arlen Chase and Diane Chase, 1987 Investigations at the Classic Maya City of Caracol, Belize: 1985-1987. Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, San Francisco. Long thought to be a tertiary center, it is now known that the site was one of the most important regional political centers of the Maya Lowlands during the Classic Period.

[[Bobbin]]

CATEGORIES: Sewing equipment

A bobbin is a spindle or cylinder, with or without flanges, on which wire, yarn, thread or film is wound. Bobbins are typically found in sewing machines, cameras, and within electronic equipment.
In non-electrical applications the bobbin is used for tidy storage without tangles. In electrical applications a coil of wire carrying a current has important magnetic properties.
As used in spinning, weaving, knitting, sewing, or lacemaking, the bobbin provides temporary or permanent storage for yarn and may be made of plastic, metal, bone or wood.
Bobbin lacemaking is a handcraft which requires the winding of yarn onto a temporary storage spindle made of wood, previously bone, often turned on a lathe. Many lace designs use dozens of bobbins at any one time. Exotic woods are extremely popular with contemporary lacemakers. Both traditional and contemporary bobbins may be decorated with designs, inscriptions, or pewter or wire inlays. Often, the bobbins are 'spangled' to provide additional weight to keep the thread in tension. A hole is drilled near the base to enable glass beads and other ornaments to be attached by a loop of wire. Again, in the modern context of the hobby of bobbin lacemaking, these spangles provide a means of self-expression in the decoration of a tool of the craft. Both antique and unique bobbins, sometimes spangled, have become highly sought after by collectors.
In the case of an electrical transformer, inductor or relay, the bobbin is a permanent container for the wire, acting to form the shape of the coil (and ease assembly of the windings into or onto the magnetic core). The bobbin may be made of thermoplastic or thermosetting (for example, phenolic) materials. This plastic often has to have a TÜV, UL or other regulatory agency flammability rating for safety reasons.

[[Wavetable synthesis]]

CATEGORIES: Sound synthesis types

Wavetable synthesis is a sound synthesis technique that employs arbitrary periodic waveforms in the production of musical tones or notes.  The technique was developed by Wolfgang Palm of PPG in the late 1970s [tpl]sfn|Palm|2009[/tpl] and published in 1979,[tpl]sfn|Andresen|1979[/tpl] and has since been used as the primary synthesis method in synthesizers built by PPG and Waldorf Music and as an auxiliary synthesis method by Sequential Circuits, Ensoniq, Korg, Access and Dave Smith Instruments among others.
It was also independently developed by Michael Mcnabb in a similar time frame, and used in his classic work, Dreamsong  (1977) https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/kna/Taxonomy_Digital_Synthesis_Techniques.html and documented in "The Making of Dreamsong," published in Computer Music Journal Volume 5, Number 4.http://www.mcnabb.com/music/pubs/CMJ_Vol5Num4.pdf

[[Forty-seven Ronin]]

CATEGORIES: Traditional stories, Samurai who committed suicide, Seppuku, Mass suicides, Quantified human groups, Edo period, Japanese folklore, 1701 in Asia, 1703 in Japan

The revenge of the [tpl]nihongo|forty-seven Ronin|四十七士|Shi-jū-shichi-shi|forty-seven samurai[/tpl] took place in Japan at the start of the 18th century. One noted Japanese scholar described the tale, the best known example of the samurai code of honor, bushidō, as the country's "national legend."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/kanadehon/Index.htm | title = Kanadehon | publisher = Columbia University[/tpl] 
The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless (becoming ronin) after their daimyo (feudal lord) Asano Naganori was compelled to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named Kira Yoshinaka, whose title was Kōzuke no suke. The ronin avenged their master's honor by killing Kira, after waiting and planning for almost two years. In turn, the ronin were themselves obliged to commit seppuku for committing the crime of murder. With much embellishment, this true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the Meiji era of Japanese history, in which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became subsumed within discourses of national heritage and identity.      
Fictionalized accounts of the tale of the Forty-seven Ronin are known as Chūshingura.  The story was popularized in numerous plays, including bunraku and kabuki. Because of the censorship laws of the shogunate in the Genroku era, which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed.  While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some [tpl]who?|date=March 2014[/tpl], the first Chūshingura was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the Chūshingura survive.
The bakufu's censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years later in the late 18th century, when Japanologist Isaac Titsingh first recorded the story of the Forty-seven Ronin as one of the significant events of the Genroku era.Screech, T. (2006). Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, p. 91. The story continues to be popular in Japan to this day. Each year on December 14, Sengakuji Temple holds a festival commemorating the event.

[[Enghien]]

Enghien ([tpl]lang-nl|Edingen[/tpl]) is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Hainaut. On January 1, 2006 Enghien had a total population of 11,980. The total area is 40.59 km² which gives a population density of 295 inhabitants per km².
The municipality comprises the city of Enghien, and the towns Marcq (Dutch: Mark) and Petit-Enghien. (Dutch: Lettelingen). It is situated on the language border in the country, and restricted language rights are granted to the Dutch speaking minority (so-called language facilities).
Enghien gave its name to a French duchy and to the commune of Enghien-les-Bains, a suburb of Paris, due to a complex series of family successions: in 1487, Mary of Luxembourg (d. 1547), the only heir of Peter II of Luxembourg (d. 1482), Count of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise and member of one of the branches of the House of Luxembourg, married François de Bourbon-Vendôme (d. 1495), the great-grandfather of King Henry IV of France. Mary of Luxembourg brought as her dowry the fief of Condé-en-Brie (Aisne département, France) and the county of Enghien, among others. These fiefs passed to her grandson Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, uncle of King Henry IV of France, who started the line of the Princes of Condé, the famous cadet branch of the French royal family.
In 1566, the county of Enghien was elevated to a duchy-peerage. However, the necessary registration process was not completed, so the title became extinct at the death of Louis I de Bourbon in 1569. In 1633, Henry II, Prince of Condé, grandson of Louis I de Bourbon, inherited the duchy of Montmorency, near Paris, after the execution of Henri II de Montmorency, brother of his wife Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency. In 1689, King Louis XIV allowed Henry III, Prince of Condé, grandson of Henry II, Prince of Condé, to rename the duchy of Montmorency as "duchy of Enghien", in memory of the duchy of Enghien which the Princes of Condé had lost in 1569 at the death of Louis I de Bourbon.
The city of Montmorency, at the heart of the duchy, continued to be known as "Montmorency", despite the official name change, but the name "Enghien" stuck to the nearby lake and marshland that developed later as a spa resort and was incorporated as the commune of Enghien-les-Bains in the 19th century.

[[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]]

CATEGORIES: English laws, 1672 in England, 1672 in law, 1672 works, 17th-century laws in Christianity, Church and state law, Charles II of England

The Royal Declaration of Indulgence was Charles II of England's attempt to extend religious liberty to Protestant nonconformists and Roman Catholics in his realms, by suspending the execution of the penal laws that punished recusants from the Church of England. Charles issued the Declaration on 15 March 1672. 
The Cavalier Parliament in 1673, however, compelled him to withdraw this declaration and implement, in its place, the first of the Test Acts (1673), which required anyone entering public service in England to deny the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and take Anglican communion. When Charles II's openly Catholic successor James II attempted to issue a similar Declaration of Indulgence, an order for general religious tolerance, this was one of the grievances that led to the Glorious Revolution that ousted him from the throne.

[[Lasne]]

Lasne ([tpl]lang-wa|Lane[/tpl]) is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant, to the south east of Brussels. On January 1, 2008 Lasne had a total population of 14,043. The total area is 47.22 km² which gives a population density of 297 inhabitants per km². Lasne is the richest municipality in the country, measured by the average taxable income of the inhabitants. It also has the lowest local taxes of any municipality in Belgium. The municipality is twinned with Azay-le-Rideau (France) and Abbeville (USA).
The municipality takes its name from the river Lasne which rises in the village of Plancenoit and flows through several of the villages which make up the municipality. The name Lasne comes from the Celtic word meaning flat or calm, presumably referring to the slow moving river.
Lasne is a semi-rural municipality retaining several working farms. 66% of the land area is rural, of which 66% is agricultural land, and the remainder, forest and open areas. In the past, there were a silk factory and sand extraction, although there is no longer any industry within the municipality. It was formed from the fusion of five municipalities: Couture-Saint-Germain, Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert, Maransart, Ohain and Plancenoit. While the municipality has taken the name of Lasne, the administrative offices are in the village of Ohain.
Ohain contains a fine example of a Brabant-Wallon village green: almost triangular in shape and sloping gently. The green contains many mature trees and is bordered on 2 sides by old houses and shops. The church in Ohain was built around the year 1200 and the strongly built square tower dates from this time.
The village of Couture St Germain contains the ruins of the Cistercian Abbey of Aywiers which has been the subject of pilgrimages since the late 19th century in honour of Saint Lutgarde who lived there for 30 years at the end of the 12th century.
Much of the Battle of Waterloo was fought in the village of Plancenoit, notably around the church and the fortified farm of La Papelotte. The cemetery wall is said to still contain holes made by musket balls. It was in Plancenoit that Blücher's troops engaged Napoleon's army, having marched from Wavre. Blücher and Wellington met after the battle at the farm 'La Belle Alliance' - now a bar. The current historic area commemorating the battle is jointly administered by the municipalities of Lasne, Waterloo and Braine-l'Alleud.
Lasne is in a region of Belgium known as the Pays Romain or Roman Land. The Grand Chemin is a major road traversing the municipality, linking the large towns of Wavre and Nivelles, and formed a part of a network of Roman roads ultimately linking the ports of the Rhine and Seine with sea ports. The distance between small chapels on this path is equal to one or more leagues, or at a precise fraction of a Gaulish league, where a Gaulish league equals 2222 metres.
In 2007, Lasne was still considered as the richest municipality of Belgium, with an average taxable income of 40,949 euros per year according to the latest report of the INS (Institut National de Statistique).

[[Grantchester]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Cambridgeshire, Civil parishes in Cambridgeshire, Geography of Cambridge

Grantchester is a village on the River Cam or Granta in Cambridgeshire, England, close to Cambridge.  It is listed in the Domesday Book (1086) as Grantesete and Grauntsethe. Grantchester is mentioned briefly in book IV, chapter 19 of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. John de Grauntsete, a lawyer who had a highly successful career as a judge in Ireland, was born in Granchester c.1270.
Grantchester is said to have the world's highest concentration of Nobel Prize winners, most of these presumably being current or retired academics from the nearby University of Cambridge. Grantchester has been home, since 1969, of the sculptor Helaine Blumenfeld OBE.
Students and tourists often travel from Cambridge by punt to picnic in the meadows or take tea at The Orchard.  In 1897, a group of Cambridge students persuaded the owner of Orchard House to serve them tea in its apple orchard, and this became a regular practice.  Lodgers at Orchard House included the Edwardian poet Rupert Brooke, who later moved next door to the Old Vicarage.  In 1912, while in Berlin, he wrote a poem of homesickness entitled "The Old Vicarage, Grantchester".  The house is currently the home of the Cambridge scientist Mary Archer and her husband, Jeffrey Archer.
The footpath to Cambridge that runs beside Grantchester Meadows is nicknamed the Grantchester Grind. Grantchester Grind is the title of a 1995 comic novel written by Tom Sharpe. Further upstream is Byron's Pool, named after Lord Byron, who is said (by Brooke, at least) to have swum there.  The pool is now below a modern weir where the Bourn Brook flows into the River Cam. Byron's Pool is a Local Nature Reserve.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&N=byron&ID=1123|title= Byron's Pool|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=4 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=lnrIndex&query=REF_CODE%3D%271084814%27 |title=Map of Byron's Pool|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=4 August 2013[/tpl]

Originally, a patriarch was a man who exercised autocratic authority as a pater familias over an extended family.  The system of such rule of families by senior males is termed patriarchy. This is a Greek word, a compound of πατριά (patria), "lineage, progeny", esp. by the father's sideπατριά, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus (which derives from the word [tpl]lang|grc|πατήρ[/tpl] – patēr meaning "father"πατήρ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus) and [tpl]lang|grc|ἄρχων[/tpl] (archon) meaning "leader", "chief", "ruler", "king", etc.ἄρχων, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseusπατριάρχης, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseuspatriarch, Oxford Dictionaries
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are referred to as the three patriarchs of the people of Israel, and the period during which they lived is termed the Patriarchal Age. It originally acquired its religious meaning in the Septuagint version of the Bible.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Patriarch[/tpl]
Today, the word has acquired specific ecclesiastical meanings.  In particular, the highest-ranking bishops in Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Catholic Church (above Major Archbishop and Primate), and the Assyrian Church of the East are termed Patriarchs (and in certain cases also popes).  The office and ecclesiastical circumscription (comprising one or more provinces, though outside his own (arch)diocese he is often without enforceable jurisdiction) of such a Patriarch is termed a Patriarchate. Historically, a Patriarch may often be the logical choice to act as Ethnarch, representing the community that is identified with his religious confession within a state or empire of a different creed (as Christians within the Ottoman Empire).

Piers Plowman (written ca. 1360–87) or Visio Willelmi de Piers Plowman (William's Vision of Piers Plowman) is a Middle English allegorical narrative poem by William Langland. It is written in unrhymed alliterative verse divided into sections called "passus" (Latin for "step"). Piers is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest works of English literature of the Middle Ages, along with Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and the Pearl poet's Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

Medical cannabis (or medical marijuana) refers to the use of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), as medical therapy to treat disease or alleviate symptoms.

Short-term use increases minor adverse effects, but does not appear to increase major adverse effects. Long-term effects of cannabis are not clear, and there are safety concerns including memory and cognition problems, risk for dependence and the risk of children taking it by accident.
Medical cannabis can be administered using a variety of methods, including vaporizing or smoking dried buds, eating extracts, and taking capsules. Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries; examples include: dronabinol (available in the United States (US) and Canada) and nabilone (available in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK), and the US). Recreational use of cannabis is illegal in most parts of the world, but the medical use of cannabis is legal in certain countries, including Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. In the US, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while 20 states and the District of Columbia have decided they are no longer willing to prosecute individuals merely for the possession or sale of marijuana, as long as the individuals are in compliance with the state's marijuana sale regulations. However, an appeals court ruled in January 2014 that a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling remains binding in relation to the ongoing illegality, in federal legislative terms, of Californian cannabis dispensaries, reaffirming the impact of the federal Controlled Substances Act.[tpl]cite web|title=Court upholds crackdown on pot dispensaries|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2014/01/15/court-upholds-crackdown-on-pot-dispensaries/|work=SFGate|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc|accessdate=3 March 2014|author=Bob Egelko|date=15 January 2014[/tpl]

Chameleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of lizards. The approximately 160 species of chameleon come in a range of colors, and many species have the ability to change colors. Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their separately mobile, stereoscopic eyes; their very long, highly modified, rapidly extrudable tongues; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their distinctively shaped heads. Many species also have a prehensile tail. Well adapted for climbing and visual hunting, they are found in warm habitats that vary from rain forest to desert conditions—in Africa, Madagascar, and southern Europe, and across south Asia as far as Sri Lanka. They have also been introduced to Hawaii, California, and Florida, and are often kept as household pets.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)]]
CATEGORIES: Mind-body dualism, Metaphysics of mind, Ontology, Theories of mind

In philosophy of mind, dualism is the position that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical,Hart, W.D. (1996) "Dualism", in A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind, ed. Samuel Guttenplan, Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 265-7. or that the mind and body are not identical.[tpl]cite book |last1=Crane |first1=Tim |last2=Patterson |first2=Sarah |year=2001 |title=History of the Mind-Body Problem |chapter=Introduction |pages=1–2 |quote=the assumption that mind and body are distinct (essentially, dualism)[/tpl] Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism, in the mind–body problem.
Aristotle shared Plato's view of multiple souls, (ψυχή psychē) and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals and people: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism, that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure and desire, that only people and other animals share; and the faculty of reason, that is unique to people only. In this view, a soul is the hylomorphic form of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance of the preceding level. Thus, for Aristotle, all three souls perish when the living organism dies.Aristotle (c. mid 4th century BC) Metaphysics (Metaphysica), ed. W.D. Ross, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1924, 2 vols; Books IV-VI, trans. C.A. Kirwan, Clarendon Aristotle Series, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971; Books VII-VIII trans. D. Bostock, Clarendon Aristotle Series, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994; Books XIII-XIV trans. J. Annas, Clarendon Aristotle Series, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1976. For Plato however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body.Plato (390s-347 BC) Platonis Opera, vol. 1, Euthyphro, Apologia Socratis, Crito, Phaedo, Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophistes, Politicus, ed. E.A. Duke, W.F. Hicken, W.S.M. Nicoll, D.B. Robinson and J.C.G. Strachan, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995.
Dualism is closely associated with the philosophy of René Descartes (1641), which holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence.Robinson, Howard, "Dualism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2003 Edition), ed. Edward N. Zalta, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2003/entries/dualism/. Hence, he was the first to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it exists today.Descartes, R. (1641) Meditations on First Philosophy, in The Philosophical Writings of René Descartes, trans. by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984, vol. 2, pp. 1-62. Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism. Substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism, but property dualism may be considered a form of emergent materialism or non-reductive physicalism in some sense.

Susan Lillian "Sue" Townsend, FRSL (2 April 1946[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]10 April 2014) was an English writer and humorist whose work encompasses novels, plays and works of journalism. She is best known for creating Adrian Mole.
After writing in secret from the age of 14, Townsend first became known for her plays, her signature character first appearing in a radio drama, but her work soon expanded into other forms. She enjoyed great success in the 1980s, with her Adrian Mole books selling more copies than any other work of fiction in Britain during the decade. This series, which eventually encompassed nine books, takes the form of the character's diaries. The earliest books recount the life of a teenage boy during the Thatcher years, but the sequence eventually depicts Adrian Mole in middle age. The Queen and I (1992), another popular work which was well received, was an outlet for her republican sentiments, although the Royal Family is still rendered with sympathy. Both the earliest Adrian Mole book and The Queen and I were adapted for the stage and enjoyed successful runs in London's West End.
Townsend was poor until well into her thirties, and used her experiences of hardship in her work. In her later years she suffered ill health, in part related to the diabetes she developed in the mid-1980s, and in her last years endured serious sight and mobility problems.

[[Pseudo-anglicism]]
CATEGORIES: Forms of English, Language histories, False friends

Pseudo-anglicisms are words in languages other than English which were borrowed from English but are used in a way native English speakers would not readily recognize or understand. Pseudo-anglicisms often take the form of compound words, combining elements of multiple English words to create a new word that appears to be English but is unrecognisable to a native speaker of English. It is also common for a genuine English word to be used to mean something completely different from its original meaning.
Pseudo-anglicisms are related to false friends or false cognates. Many speakers of a language which employs pseudo-anglicisms believe that the relevant words are genuine anglicisms and can be used in English, which may cause misunderstandings.
When many English words are incorporated into many languages, language enthusiasts and purists often look down on this phenomenon, terming it (depending on the importing language) Denglisch, Franglais or similar neologisms.

Iva Ikuko Toguri D'Aquino (July 4, 1916 – September 26, 2006) was an American citizen who participated in English-language propaganda broadcast transmitted by Radio Tokyo to Allied soldiers in the South Pacific during World War II. Although on the Zero Hour radio show, Toguri called herself "Orphan Ann," she quickly became identified with the moniker "Tokyo Rose", a name that was coined by Allied soldiers and that predated her broadcasts. After the Japanese defeat, Toguri was detained for a year by the U.S. military before being released for lack of evidence. Department of Justice officials agreed that her broadcasts were "innocuous". But when Toguri tried to return to the US, a popular uproar ensued, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to renew its investigation of Toguri's wartime activities. She was subsequently charged by the United States Attorney's Office with eight counts of treason. Her 1949 trial resulted in a conviction on one count, making her the seventh American to be convicted on that charge, for which she spent more than six years out of a ten-year sentence in prison. Belatedly, however, after investigative journalists found that key witnesses claimed they were forced to lie during testimony, Toguri was pardoned by U.S. President Gerald Ford in 1977.Masayo Duus, Tokyo Rose: Orphan of the Pacific, Kodansha International, 1979; Ann Elizabeth Pfau, Miss Yourlovin: GIs, Gender, and Domesticity during World War II, Columbia University Press, 2008, chapter 5, http://www.gutenberg-e.org/pfau/chapter5.html

Magnetism in bar magnets and electromagnets does not arise from magnetic monopoles, and in fact there is no conclusive experimental evidence that magnetic monopoles exist at all in the universe.

Tokyo Rose (alternative spelling Tokio Rose) was a generic name given by Allied forces in the South Pacific during World War II to any of approximately a dozen English-speaking female broadcasters of Japanese propaganda. However, Iva Toguri is the most famously linked name behind the Tokyo Rose.  She was a native to Los Angeles and was stranded in Japan because she was visiting her family when the war broke out. The intent of these broadcasts was to disrupt the morale of Allied forces listening to the broadcast.Iva Toguri d’Aquino and “Tokyo Rose”, FBI website, History section. American servicemen in the Pacific often listened to the propaganda broadcasts to get a sense, by reading between the lines, of the effect of their military actions. She often undermined the anti-American scripts by reading them in a playful, tongue-in-cheek fashion, even going as far as to warn her listeners to expect a “subtle attack” on their morale. 
Farther from the action, stories circulated that Tokyo Rose could be unnervingly accurate, naming units and even individual servicemen; though such stories have never been substantiated by documents such as scripts and recorded broadcasts, they have been reflected in popular books and films such as Flags of Our Fathers.The Legend of Tokyo Rose by Ann Elizabeth Pfau Similar rumors surround the propaganda broadcasts of Lord Haw-Haw and Axis Sally.Talking History radio program on "World War II Radio Propaganda: Real and Imaginary" and Ann Elizabeth Pfau and David Householder, "'Her Voice a Bullet': Imaginary Propaganda and the Legendary Broadcasters of World War II," Sound in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, eds. Susan Strasser and David Suisman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009.
Toguri’s prominence saw her branded as one of the war’s most notorious propagandists, but evidence shows that she was not a Japanese sympathizer. Toguri’s program became conflated with more vicious propaganda, and she was arrested and convicted of treason after the Japanese surrender. She was released from prison in 1956, but it would take more than 20 years before she finally received an official presidential pardon for her role in the war.

Spectra: A Book of Poetic Experiments was a small volume of poetry published in 1916 by American writers Witter Bynner, who wrote under the pseudonym "Emanuel Morgan", and Arthur Davison Ficke, who wrote as "Anne Knish." The book was intended as satire directed at the Imagism poetry movement.Poetry Foundation. http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/witter-bynner
Spectra was preceded by a brief manifesto outlining the Spectric method as a school:
The poems in the collection were identified by opus numbers rather than titles, and mostly take on a silly tone.Museum of Hoaxes. http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/spectric_poetry
From "Opus 6" by Emanuel Morgan:
Anne Knish's Opus 118:
Spectra was intended solely as a joke. Initially, even the publisher was fooled by the book, but he was let in on the joke before going to press. The authors assumed the ridiculousness of the work would shine through, but it was actually accepted as a legitimate poetic movement for two years. In 1918, Brynner admitted in a public speech that he had co-authored the book and explained the hoax.The Spectra Hoax | Primary Selections from Special Collections
Both Bynner and Ficke were accomplished poets of their time, but the Spectra poems are probably the most widely remembered of their work.Witter Bynner : The Poetry FoundationPoetry Foundation Both authors admitted to the hoax having backfired to a certain extent, as it overshadowed their more serious work. Nonetheless, Ficke stated that he learned a good deal about composition while writing as Knish, adding that it actually influenced his later work.

[[How-to]]
CATEGORIES: How-to, Procedural knowledge, Technical communication, Skills

A how-to is an informal, often short, description of how to accomplish a specific task. A how-to is usually meant to help non-experts, may leave out details that are only important to experts, and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic. One of the earliest how-to books was published in 1569 by Thomas Wight and entitled, A booke of the arte and maner, how to plant and graffe all sortes of trees: With divers other new practise, by one of the Abbey of Saint Vincent in Fraunce by Leonard Mascall.

[[Emergency Alert System]]

CATEGORIES: Civil defense, Emergency Alert System, Disaster preparedness in the United States

The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a national warning system in the United States put into place on January 1, 1997, when it superseded the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), which in turn superseded the CONELRAD System. The official EAS is designed to enable the President of the United States to speak to the United States within 10 minutes.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23240430 | work=BBC News | title=Emergency broadcasts can be hacked, US researchers say | date=July 9, 2013[/tpl] In addition to this requirement, EAS is also designed to alert the public of local weather emergencies such as tornadoes and flash floods. A national EAS test was conducted on November 9, 2011, at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, but the nationwide federal EAS has never been activated.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fcc.gov/rulemaking/04-296 | title=Review of the Emergency Alert System | publisher=Federal Communications Commission [/tpl]
EAS is jointly coordinated by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS). The EAS regulations and standards are governed by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau of the FCC. Each state and several territories have their own EAS plan.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fcc.gov/pshs/services/eas/ | title=Emergency Alert System |publisher=FCC |date=November 9, 2011 [/tpl] EAS has become part of IPAWS – the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, a program of FEMA.
EAS messages are transmitted via AM, FM, broadcast television, cable television and Land Mobile Radio Service, as well as VHF, UHF, and FiOS (wireline video providers). Digital television, satellite television and digital cable providers, along with Sirius XM satellite radio, IBOC, DAB and digital radio broadcasters have been required to participate in the EAS since December 31, 2006.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] DirecTV, Dish Network and all other DBS providers have been required to participate since May 31, 2007.
In 2008, the FCC began work on another system for public alerting designed and targeted at smartphones, meant to support the EAS. The Commercial Mobile Alert System made its debut in about early 2013 in select states for select events. While this system functions independently from the Emergency Alert System, it may broadcast identical information.

is a common law doctrine which transfers the property of a person who dies without heirs to the crown or state. It serves  to ensure that property is not left in "limbo" without recognized ownership.  It originally applied to a number of situations where a legal interest in land was destroyed by operation of law, so that the ownership of the land reverted to the immediately superior feudal lord.

Techno-thrillers (or technothrillers) are a hybrid genre, drawing subject matter generally from science fiction, thrillers, spy, action, and war. They include a disproportionate amount (relative to other genres) of technical details on its subject matter (typically military technology); only science fiction tends towards a comparable level of supporting detail on the technical side. The inner workings of technology and the mechanics of various disciplines (espionage, martial arts, politics) are thoroughly explored, and the plot often turns on the particulars of that exploration.

[[Ferris wheel]]

CATEGORIES: Ferris wheels, American inventions, World Digital Library related, Articles which contain graphical timelines

A Ferris wheel (also known as an observation wheel or big wheel), named after George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr., is a nonbuilding structure consisting of a rotating upright wheel with multiple passenger-carrying components (commonly referred to as passenger cars, cabins, capsules, gondolas, or pods) attached to the rim in such a way that as the wheel turns, they are kept upright, usually by gravity.
Some of the largest modern Ferris wheels have cars mounted on the outside of the rim, with electric motors to independently rotate each car to keep it upright. These wheels are sometimes referred to as observation wheels, and their cars referred to as capsules, however these alternative names are also sometimes used for wheels with conventional gravity-oriented cars.
The original Ferris Wheel was designed and constructed by George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr. as a landmark for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The term Ferris wheel is used generically for all such structures, which are now the most common type of carnival ride at state fairs in the US.Still turning – Jacksonville built the world's first portable Ferris Wheel

Red Storm Rising is a 1986 techno-thriller novel by Tom Clancy about a Third World War in Europe between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces, set around the mid-1980s. Though there are other novels dealing with a fictional World War III, this one is notable for the way in which numerous settings for the action—from Atlantic convoy duty to shooting down reconnaissance satellites to tank battles in Germany—all have an integral part to play on the outcome. It was also unusual in its depiction of a WWIII fought exclusively with conventional weapons, rather than escalating to nuclear warfare.
This is one of three novels (the others being SSN, and Against All Enemies) that has no association with Clancy's others, as it does not fall in the Jack Ryan universe.
The novel eventually lent its name to a game development company called Red Storm Entertainment, which Clancy co-founded in 1997.

[[Dilbert principle]]

CATEGORIES: 1996 books, Aspects of organizations, Business books, Dilbert books

The Dilbert principle refers to a 1990s theory by Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams stating that companies tend to systematically promote their least-competent employees to management (generally middle management), in order to limit the amount of damage they are capable of doing. In the Dilbert strip of February 5, 1995, Dogbert says that "leadership is nature's way of removing morons from the productive flow". Adams himself explained,[tpl]cite news |title=Funny Business |author= |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/bized/p16-21.pdf |newspaper=BizEd |date=November–December 2002 |accessdate=April 23, 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]
 I wrote The Dilbert Principle around the concept that in many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they’re the ones you don't want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments—you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers—your smart people—aren’t in management. That principle was literally happening everywhere. 
Adams explained the principle in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article.Adams, Scott. "Manager's journal: The Dilbert principle. " Wall Street Journal  York, N.Y. 22  May 1995, Eastern edition: A12. Wall Street Journal. Adams then expanded his study of the Dilbert principle in a satirical 1996 book of the same name, which is required or recommended reading at some management and business programs.berkeley.eduReadings for CSCI 3308 - Software Engineering Methods and Tools[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl][tpl]Wayback|url=http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm|title=Syllabus - SW Project Mgt - CSE5315 - 1998|date=20030220024018[/tpl]EM 501 Management of Organizations In the book, Adams writes that, in terms of effectiveness, use of the Dilbert principle is akin to a band of gorillas choosing an alpha-squirrel to lead them. The book has sold more than a million copies and was on the New York Times bestseller list for 43 weeks.
Adams' presentation of the principle is satirical—facetious but also addressing a real-world concern.
The Dilbert principle is comparable to the Peter Principle. As opposed to the Dilbert principle, the Peter Principle assumes that people are promoted because they are competent, and that the tasks higher up in the hierarchy require skills or talents they do not possess. It concludes that due to this, a competent employee will eventually be promoted to, and remain at, a position at which he or she is incompetent. In his book, The Peter Principle, Laurence J. Peter explains "percussive sublimation", the act of kicking a person upstairs (i.e. promoting him to management) to get him out of the way of productive employees.
The Dilbert principle, by contrast, assumes that hierarchy just serves as a means for removing the incompetent to "higher" positions where they will be unable to cause damage to the workflow, assuming that the upper echelons of an organization have little relevance to its actual production, and that the majority of real, productive work in a company is done by people lower in the power ladder. An earlier formulation of this effect was known as Putt's Law.

CATEGORIES: Cryptography

In cryptography, ciphertext (or cyphertext) is the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm, called a cipher.[tpl]cite book |author=Berti, Hansche, Hare |title=Official (ISC)² Guide to the CISSP Exam |publisher=Auerbach Publications |year=2003 |pages=379 |isbn=0-8493-1707-X[/tpl] Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it. Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext. Ciphertext is not to be confused with codetext because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.

[[The Dilbert Future]]

CATEGORIES: Dilbert books

The Dilbert Future (1997) is a book published by Scott Adams as a satire of humanity that breaks the net motivations of humanity down into stupidity, selfishness, and "horniness", and presents various ideas for profiting from human nature.  The final chapter invites the reader to ponder upon several open ended questions, such as the nature of gravity and the utility of affirmations, which are further addressed in God’s Debris.
Adams makes several "predictions" throughout the book intended for humorous effect. 
Scott Adams did publish in issue 15 of his Dilbert Newsletter (sent to all members of Dogbert's New Ruling Class) an excerpt from this book with permission  for it to be re-published (if kept with the copyright text).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/html/newsletter15.html |title=Dilbert Newsletter #15 |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl]
Adams introduced the word confusopoly in this book. The word is a portmanteau of confusion and monopoly (or rather oligopoly), defining it as "a group of companies with similar products who intentionally confuse customers instead of competing on price". Examples of industries in which confusopolies exist (according to Adams) include telephone service, insurance, mortgage loans, banking, and financial services. Adams also explains his belief that positive affirmations can influence external events, claiming that this has worked for him in the past.

In Hinduism and Buddhism, "Bhakti" (also spelled Bhakthi;Tamil:பக்தி  [tpl]lang-sa|भक्ति[/tpl]) is a technical term meaning "portion, share", from the root bhaj- "to partake in, to receive one's share".See Monier-Williams, Sanskrit Dictionary, 1899. It refers to religious devotion in the form of active involvement of a devotee in worship of the divine. Within monotheistic Hinduism, it is the love felt by the worshipper towards the personal God, a concept expressed in Hindu theology as Iṣṭa-devatā (also as Svayam Bhagavan in Gaudiya Vaishnavism).
Bhakthi can be used of either tradition of Hindu monotheism, Shaivaism or Vaishnavism.[tpl]cite book|last=Rinehart|first=Robin|title=Contemporary Hinduism: ritual, culture, and practice|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=45|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&pg=PA45|year=2004[/tpl]
While bhakti as designating a religious path is already a central concept in the Bhagavad Gita,Prentiss, p. 5, it rises to importance in the medieval history of Hinduism, where the Bhakti movement  saw a rapid growth of bhakti beginning in Southern India with the Vaisnava Alvars (6th-9th century CE) and Saiva Nayanars (5th-10th century CE), who spread bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India by the 12th-18th century CE.[tpl]cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|pages=131|isbn=978-0-521-43878-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&pg=PA131[/tpl]

[[Bhakti movement]]

CATEGORIES: Bhakti movement, Hindu movements and organizations

The Bhakti movement was a Hindu religious movement of the medieval period that promoted the belief that salvation was attainable by everyone. The movement is closely related to Islamic Sufism, which appeared around the same time: both advocated that a personal expression of devotion to God is the way to become at one with him.
The Bhakti movement originated in seventh-century Tamil Nadu and spread northwards through India. While the southern movement favoured devotion to Shiva, Vishnu and his avatars, the northern devotional movement was centered on Rama and Krishna, both of whom are believed to be incarnations of Vishnu. Despite this, the sects of Shiva or of Vishnu did not go into decline. In fact, for all of its history, the Bhakti movement co-existed peacefully with the other movements in Hinduism. It was initially considered unorthodox, as it rebelled against caste distinctions and disregarded Brahmanic rituals, which according to Bhakti saints were not necessary for salvation. In the course of time, however, owing to its immense popularity among the masses (and even gaining royal patronage) it became 'orthodox' and continues to be one of the most important modes of religious expression in modern India.
During the 14th–17th centuries, a great Bhakti movement swept through central and northern India, initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or sants. Ramananda, Ravidas, Srimanta Sankardeva, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallabhacharya, Surdas, Meera Bai, Kabir, Tulsidas, Namdev, Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram and other mystics spearheaded the Bhakti movement in the North while Annamacharya, Bhadrachala Ramadas, Tyagaraja among others propagated Bhakti in the South. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste, and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by a spate of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces.
While many of the Bhakti mystics focused their attention on Krishna or Rama, it did not necessarily mean that the sect of Shiva was marginalized. In the twelfth century Basava founded the ViraShaiva school or Virashaivism. He rejected the caste system, denied the supremacy of the Brahmins, condemned ritual sacrifice and insisted on Bhakti and the worship of the one God, Shiva. His followers were called Vira-Shaivas, meaning "stalwart Shiva-worshipers". One of the prominent figure in this tradition is Akka Mahadevi, a contemporary of Basava.
Seminal Bhakti works in Bengali include the many songs of Ramprasad Sen. His pieces are known as Shyama Sangeet. Coming from the 17th century, they cover an astonishing range of emotional responses to Ma Kali, detailing philosophical statements based on Vedanta teachings and more visceral pronouncements of his love of Devi. Using inventive allegory, Ramprasad had 'dialogues' with the Mother Goddess through his poetry, at times chiding her, adoring her, celebrating her as the Divine Mother, reckless consort of Shiva and capricious Shakti, the universal female creative energy, of the cosmos. In 19th century Ramakrishna Parmahansa led a life of devotion and surrender to Ma Kali.
Mirabai was one of the bhakti poets.
It advocated communal harmony among various religious groups in medieval India through the teachings of sants like Kabir.

[[Footrot Flats]]

CATEGORIES: Comic strips started in the 1970s, Comics about dogs, New Zealand comic strips

Footrot Flats was a comic strip written by New Zealand cartoonist Murray Ball.  It ran from 1975 until 1994 in newspapers around the world, though the unpublished strips continued to be released in book form until 2000. Altogether there are 27 numbered books (collecting the newspaper strips, with additional material), a further 8 books collecting the Sunday newspaper strips, and 5 smaller 'pocket' books of original material, plus various related publications. There was also a stage musical, an animated feature film called Footrot Flats: the Dog's Tail Tale, and even a theme park in New Zealand. The strip reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1980s, with the books selling millions of copies in Australasia. At various times, Ball cited different reasons for quitting the strip, including the death of his own dog, and his displeasure with the direction of New Zealand politics. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
The cartoon was based around the life of Wal Footrot's sheepdog, called "Dog", on their farm Footrot Flats, and the other characters, human and animal, that came into their lives. The Dog's thoughts are voiced in thought bubbles, though he is clearly "just a dog" rather than the heavily anthropomorphised creatures sometimes found in other comics or animation. The humour was based around the foibles of the characters, which many, particularly farmers themselves, found easy to recognise around them. There was much "humour in adversity", making fun of the daily struggle that permeates farming life. The depictions of the animals are quite realistic and detailed, with a dose of comic anthropomorphism superimposed without spoiling the farming realism.

God's Debris: A Thought Experiment is a 2001 novella by Dilbert creator Scott Adams.
God's Debris espouses a philosophy based on the idea that the simplest explanation tends to be the best (a corruption of Occam's Razor). It surmises that an omnipotent God annihilated himself in the Big Bang, because an omniscient God would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence, and exists now as the smallest units of matter and the law of probability, or "God's debris", hence the title.
The introduction disclaims any personal views held by the author, "The opinions and philosophies expressed by the characters are not my own, except by coincidence in a few spots not worth mentioning".God's Debris, page X

[[Dark ride]]
CATEGORIES: Dark rides

A dark ride or ghost train (United Kingdom and Australia) is an indoor amusement ride where riders in guided vehicles travel through specially lit scenes that typically contain animation, sound, music, and special effects.
A dark ride does not have to be dark. They are enclosed, so all illumination is artificial, and most use special lighting to achieve theatrical effects. Selective use of darkness helps hide the ride mechanisms and increase the visual drama of the experience. Disney's "It's a Small World" is an example of a brightly lit dark ride.

Norway followed, granting full women's suffrage in 1913. Most European, Asian and African countries did not pass women's suffrage until after World War I.

Extended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women's suffrage.

The United Nations encouraged women's suffrage in the years following World War II, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979) identifies it as a basic right. 187 countries are parties to the Convention.

[[Moral hazard]]
CATEGORIES: Asymmetric information, Market failure, Business ethics, Risk, Economics of uncertainty, Anti-patterns, United States housing bubble, Insurance

In economic theory, a moral hazard is a situation where a party will have a tendency to take risks because the costs that could result will not be felt by the party taking the risk. In other words, it is a tendency to be more willing to take a risk, knowing that the potential costs or burdens of taking such risk will be borne, in whole or in part, by others. A moral hazard may occur where the actions of one party may change to the detriment of another after a financial transaction has taken place.
Moral hazard arises because an individual or institution does not take the full consequences and responsibilities of its actions, and therefore has a tendency to act less carefully than it otherwise would, leaving another party to hold some responsibility for the consequences of those actions.
Economists explain moral hazard as a special case of information asymmetry, a situation in which one party in a transaction has more information than another. In particular, moral hazard may occur if a party that is insulated from risk has more information about its actions and intentions than the party paying for the negative consequences of the risk. More broadly, moral hazard occurs when the party with more information about its actions or intentions has a tendency or incentive to behave inappropriately from the perspective of the party with less information.
Moral hazard also arises in a principal–agent problem, where one party, called an agent, acts on behalf of another party, called the principal. The agent usually has more information about his or her actions or intentions than the principal does, because the principal usually cannot completely monitor the agent. The agent may have an incentive to act inappropriately (from the viewpoint of the principal) if the interests of the agent and the principal are not aligned.

Metaphorical language is the use of a complex system of metaphors to create a sub-language within a common language which provides the basic terms (verbs, prepositions, conjunctions) to express metaphors.
People who over-expose themselves to environments atypical from their usual habits tend to develop understanding of new words and apply new meanings to existing words. Such sources could include: absorbing a native language spoken in a different dialects or countries, a language other than their own and fictional language from books, music, films and videogames.
People who are classified with Autistic Spectrum Disorder tend to communicate metaphorically rather than with common phrases. It is currently not known why they can do this, although they also express other abnormalities from level 1 and 2 psychedelic experiences.

Animal testing, also known as animal experimentation, animal research, and in vivo testing, is the use of non-human animals in experiments (although some research about animals involves only natural behaviors or pure observation, such as a mouse running a maze or field studies of chimp troops). The research is conducted inside universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, farms, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a7 |title="Introduction", Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures Report|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl] It includes pure research (such as genetics, developmental biology, and behavioral studies) as well as applied research (such as biomedical research, xenotransplantation, drug testing, and toxicology tests, including cosmetics testing). Animals are also used for education, breeding, and defense research. The practice is regulated to various degrees in different countries.

[[Panorama]]
CATEGORIES: Panorama, Panorama photography, Photography by genre, Landscape art, Photographs by topic

A panorama (formed from Greek πᾶν "all" + ὅραμα "sight"),  is any wide-angle view or representation of a physical space, whether in painting, drawing, photography, film, seismic images or a three-dimensional model.  The word was originally coined in the 18th centuryA Review of ‘The Panoramic River,’ at the Hudson River Museum - NYTimes.com by the Irish painter Robert Barker to describe his panoramic paintings of Edinburgh and London. The motion-picture term panning is derived from panorama.
A panoramic view is also proposed for multi-media, cross-scale applications to outline overview (from a distance) along and across repositories. This so-called "cognitive panorama" is a panoramic view over, and a combination of, cognitive spaces.For more see the International Encyclopedia of Systems and Cybernetics.

[[Monopropellant]]
CATEGORIES: Rocket propellants, Monopropellants

Monopropellants are propellants consisting of chemicals that do not require an oxidizer to release their stored chemical energy. While stable under defined storage conditions, they decompose very rapidly under certain other conditions to produce a large volume of energetic (hot) gases for the performance of mechanical work. Although solid deflagrants such as nitrocellulose, the most commonly used propellant in firearms, and ammonium perchlorate/aluminum/synthetic rubber, widely used in military and spacecraft boosters, could be thought of as monopropellants, the term is usually reserved for liquids in engineering literature. Monopropellants release their energy through exothermic chemical decomposition. The molecular bond energy of the monopellant is released usually through use of a catalyst. This can be contrasted with bipropellants that release energy through the chemical reaction between an oxidizer and a fuel.

[[Photon mapping]]

CATEGORIES: Global illumination algorithms

In computer graphics, photon mapping is a two-pass global illumination algorithm developed by Henrik Wann Jensen that approximately solves the rendering equation. Rays from the light source and rays from the camera are traced independently until some termination criterion is met, then they are connected in a second step to produce a radiance value. It is used to realistically simulate the interaction of light with different objects. Specifically, it is capable of simulating the refraction of light through a transparent substance such as glass or water, diffuse interreflection between illuminated objects, the subsurface scattering of light in translucent materials, and some of the effects caused by particulate matter such as smoke or water vapor.  It can also be extended to more accurate simulations of light such as spectral rendering.
Unlike path tracing, bidirectional path tracing and Metropolis light transport, photon mapping is a "biased" rendering algorithm, which means that averaging many renders using this method does not converge to a correct solution to the rendering equation.  However, since it is a consistent method, a correct solution can be achieved by increasing the number of photons.

[[Cayley–Dickson construction]]
CATEGORIES: Hypercomplex numbers

In mathematics, the Cayley–Dickson construction, named after Arthur Cayley and Leonard Eugene Dickson, produces a sequence of algebras over the field of real numbers, each with twice the dimension of the previous one. The algebras produced by this process are known as Cayley–Dickson algebras. They are useful composition algebras frequently applied in mathematical physics.
The Cayley–Dickson construction defines a new algebra based on the direct sum of an algebra with itself, with multiplication defined in a specific way and an involution known as conjugation.  The product of an element and its conjugate (or sometimes the square root of this) is called the norm.
The symmetries of the real field disappear as the Cayley–Dickson construction is repeatedly applied: first losing order, then commutativity of multiplication, and next associativity of multiplication.
More generally, the Cayley–Dickson construction takes any algebra with involution to another algebra with involution of twice the dimension.Schafer (1995) p.45

[[Hypercomputation]]
CATEGORIES: Theory of computation, Hypercomputation

Hypercomputation or super-Turing computation refers to models of computation that go beyond, or are incomparable to, Turing computability. This includes various hypothetical methods for the computation of non-Turing-computable functions, following super-recursive algorithms (see also supertask). The term "super-Turing computation" appeared in a 1995 Science paper by Hava Siegelmann. The term "hypercomputation" was introduced in 1999 by Jack Copeland and Diane Proudfoot.Copeland and Proudfoot, Alan Turing's forgotten ideas in computer science. Scientific American, April 1999
The terms are not quite synonymous: "super-Turing computation" usually implies that the proposed model is supposed to be physically realizable, while "hypercomputation" does not.
Technical arguments against the physical realizability of hypercomputations have been presented.

[[Passivation (chemistry)]]

CATEGORIES: Corrosion prevention

Passivation, in physical chemistry and engineering, refers to a material becoming "passive," that is, being less affected by environmental factors such as air and water. Passivation involves a shielding outer-layer of corrosion, which can be applied as a microcoating, or which occurs spontaneously in nature. As a technique, passivation is the use of a light coat of a protective material, such as metal oxide, to create a shell against corrosion. Passivation can occur only in certain conditions, and is used in microelectronics to enhance silicon.IUPAC Goldbook The technique of passivation is used to strengthen and preserve the appearance of metallics.
When exposed to air, many metals naturally form a hard, relatively inert surface such as the tarnishing of silver. In metals such as steel, uniform corrosion produces a somewhat rough surface by removing a substantial amount of metal, which either dissolves in the environment or reacts with it to produce a loosely adherent, porous coating of corrosion products. The reduction of the rate of corrosion will vary, depending on the metal and its environment, and is notably slowed at room-temperature air for aluminium, chromium, zinc, titanium, and silicon (a metalloid); the shell inhibits deeper corrosion, and so is the key factor of passivation. The inert surface layer, termed the ‘’native oxide layer‘’, is usually an oxide or a nitride, with a thickness of a monolayer (1-3Å) for a noble metal like platinum, about 15 Å for silicon and nearer to 50Å for aluminium after several years.http://www.semi1source.com/glossary/default.asp?searchterm=native+oxide[tpl]harvnb|O'M.

HiDef (short for high definition), also called 24p, is a 24 frames-per-second digital video format for high-resolution capture of motion pictures. The 24 refers to the frame rate (24 frames/second) and the p stands for progressive scanning (as opposed to interlaced scanning).Wilt, A. (2003, November). 24p dissected. In Technical difficulties. DV, 11, 88. As of 2003, there are two 24p HD formats: Sony 24p and Panasonic 24p. 
Cameras of this capture depth have been available only since about 2001. Notably, they were used by George Lucas for the production of his second Star Wars prequel, Attack of the Clones. The advantage of shooting with digital-capture cameras is the efficiency in the production process. To edit scenes digitally, no transfer from film to digital is required. Also, if it is projected with a digital projector, no transference to film is required, either.

[[Single-8]]

CATEGORIES: Movie film formats, Fujifilm

Single-8 is a motion picture film format introduced by Fujifilm of Japan in 1965 as an alternative to the Kodak Super 8 format. The company Konan (that developed the Konan-16 subminiature camera) claims in its history page to have developed the Single-8 system in 1959.
Although the film is thinner, the other dimensions of Single-8 such as the sprocket holes and sound track, are the same as Super 8. Single-8 can be projected in Super 8 projectors and vice versa. Single-8 comes pre-loaded in B-shaped cartridges, with two separate spools unlike the coaxial system of Super 8. As a result, Single-8 film offered unlimited rewind, whereas Super 8 rewind was limited to several seconds and relied on there being sufficient empty space within the cartridge for the rewound film to pile up inside.  
The Single 8 cartridge was designed to use the camera's film gate to hold the film in place during exposure.  This contrasted with the Kodak system which had a plastic pressure plate built into the cartridge. It was widely believed by Single 8 enthusiasts that this would offer superior film positioning, but the reality was that Super 8's plastic pressure plate could be moulded with far smaller tolerance than Single 8's metal version could be machined.
It has a polyester base that is thinner than the Kodak films, so splicing the two formats together in a finished film may require adjustment of the projector's focus at the join.
Although never as popular internationally as Super 8, the format continued to live in parallel. As of early  2007, Fuji still manufactures two versions of Single-8 film. Fujichrome R25N is Daylight Balanced Filmstock, while Fujichrome RT200N is Tungsten Balanced(3400K) for indoor filming. The Sound Film brand is no longer made, although a magnetic sound stripe can be added to the film after processing. This option is chosen whenever sending the exposed film to Fuji in Japan. In addition to Fuji's own film, black and white film is available from Japanese company Retro Enterprises. This Single-8 black & white reversal film, named Retro X, is of ASA/ISO 200 and is manufactured in Germany. 
Although Fujifilm has stopped exportation of Single-8 Film to other countries, individual companies in the USA and Europe import the filmstock independently. Single-8 is readily available in its home country of Japan where even used cameras can reach high prices in online auctions on Yahoo! Japan. A used Fujica ZC1000, the top of the line Single-8 camera, can fetch prices upwards to 250,000 Japanese Yen (approx $2900). DAICON FILM of Japan (now Gainax) produced a series of well-known tokusatsu films in the 1980s using Single-8 film, some now available on DVD.

Hilario Zapata (born August 19, 1958) is a former boxer who was a two-time world Jr. Flyweight champion and a one time world flyweight champion. Zapata is a Panamanian.
Zapata began his professional boxing career in 1977, beating Victor Lopez by a knockout in the second round. He had 2 wins in '77.
He had a fast ascent to the top, starting in 1978. By his fifth bout, on July 1, he was meeting former world Flyweight champion Joan Guzmán in Panama City, beating Guzman by a decision in ten. His next fight, against Yong-Hwang Kim, in South Korea, was his first fight abroad; he gave himself a twentieth birthday present by beating Kim by a 10 round decision on August 19. Then, he met future world Flyweight champion Alfonso Lopez, for the vacant Latin American Jr. Flyweight belt. Zapata suffered his first loss in the fight against Lopez, when he was beaten by a decision in 12.
He started 1979 with a fight against Ramon Perez in Puerto Rico, winning by a knockout in nine. He had three more wins in 1979, including one over the two time world Flyweight champion Freddie Castillo, and by the end of that year he was ranked number one in the world among Jr. Flyweight challengers by the WBC.
Zapata went to Japan in March 1980, and on the 24th day of that month he beat defending world champion Shigeo Nakajima to become world Jr. Flyweight champion. He defended his title against Chi-Bok Kim, winning a 15 round unanimous decision in South Korea, against Hector Rey Melendez in Venezuela, winning also by a 15 round decision, against Nakajima in a Tokyo rematch, winning by knockout in 11, and against Reynaldo Becerra in Venezuela. He closed out 1980 win a 15 round decision win over Becerra. 
In 1981, he and future world Flyweight champion Joey Olivo fought what was the only Jr. Flyweight title bout ever broadcast on American national TV live until Michael Carbajal came along nine years later. Zapata beat Olivo by a knockout in round 13 to retain his belt, and then, he went to San Francisco to retain the crown once again, with a 15 round decision over Rudy Crawford. On August 15, and back home in Panama City, he beat Mexican German Torres by a decision in 15 to retain his belt, and then he faced former world Jr. Flyweight champion Netrnoi Sor Vorasingh, retaining the belt by a knockout in 10.
In his next fight, on February 6, 1982, Zapata lost the world title by knockout in two at the hands of Amado Panterita Ursua, but Ursua in turn would lose it to Tadashi Tomori. On July 20, Zapata regained the world title by beating Tomori on a 15 round decision in Japan. Then, he beat future world champion and Zapata-conqueror Jung-Koo Chang by a decision in 15 in Chonju, and he closed out the year with a rematch against Tomori in Tokyo, knocking Tomori out in eight rounds.
On March 26, 1983, Zapata and Chang met again in South Korea, and this time, Chang became world champion by knocking Zapata out in the third round. Then, on November 10 at Las Vegas, on the Marvin Hagler-Roberto Durán undercard, Zapata was beaten by a knockout in 10 by Harold Petty.
His career seemingly over, he quickly recovered from those back to back losses and began winning again, but this time as a Flyweight. By the end of 1984, he was ranked number one by the WBA among Flyweights, and on December 8 of that year, he challenged world Flyweight champion Santos Laciar of Argentina at Buenos Aires' legendary Luna Park. Zapata lost a 15 round decision that night, but in 1986, after Laciar had vacated the crown, the WBA gave him a second chance, and he beat Alonzo Gonzalez to win the WBA world Flyweight championship. He then beat Javier Lucas to retain the belt. He retained the title also against Shuichi Hozumi, Dodie Penalosa, Alberto Castro and Claudemir Calvalho, all by decision, before losing it to Fidel Bassa of Colombia, also by a decision.
In 1993, he tried to become a world champion once again, but was knocked out in the first round by the WBC world Jr. Bantamweight champion Sung-Kil Moon. A win against Moon would have made Zapata a member of the exclusive group of world boxing champions in three different weight categories or more.
It can also be added that Zapata's first pair of boxing gloves, when he was 12, came as a present from Duran himself.
Panamanian newspaper El Panama America declared recently on one of their editorials that Zapata, according to their opinion, should be inducted to the International Boxing Hall Of Fame soon.
Zapata had a record of 43 wins and 10 losses, with 1 draw, and 15 wins by knockout.

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. (CPII) is an American film production and distribution studio, that is part of the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group, owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2080/0000950123-11-062283.pdf |title=Sony, Form 20-F, Filing Date Jun 28, 2011 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 27, 2013[/tpl] It is one of the leading film studios in the world, a member of the so-called Big Six. It was one of the so-called Little Three among the eight major film studios of Hollywood's Golden Age.Grady, Frank. "THE STUDIO ERA". umsl.edu. Retrieved March 14, 2011.
The studio, founded in 1918 as Cohn-Brandt-Cohn Film Sales by brothers Jack and Harry Cohn and Joe Brandt, released its first feature film in August 1922. It adopted the Columbia Pictures name in 1924 and went public two years later. The name is derived from "Columbia", a national personification of the United States, which is used as the company's logo.
In its early years a minor player in Hollywood, Columbia began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra.
With Capra and others, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant (who was shared with RKO Pictures). In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford, and William Holden also became major stars at the studio.
In 1982, the studio was purchased by Coca-Cola; that same year it launched TriStar Pictures as a joint venture with HBO and CBS. Five years later, Coca-Cola spun off Columbia, which was sold to Tri-Star as the latter became Columbia Pictures Entertainment. After a brief period of independence with Coca-Cola maintaining a financial interest, the combined studio was acquired by Japanese company Sony in 1989.[tpl]cite news|title=Sony to Buy Columbia, Says Americans Will Run Studio : 1st Sale of Film Maker to Japanese|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-27/news/mn-335_1_columbia-pictures-entertainment|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=latimes.com|date=27 September 1989[/tpl]

[[Mainstream hardcore]]
CATEGORIES: Hardcore techno, Hardcore music genres, Dutch music, Dutch styles of music

[tpl]Refimprove|date=February 2007[/tpl]

Hardcore or Gabber, is a style of electronic music 
The essence of Hardcore sound is a distorted bass drum sound, overdriven to the point where it becomes clipped into a distorted square wave and makes a recognizably melodic tone. 
Often the Roland Alpha Juno or the kick from a Roland TR-909 was used to create this sound. Gabber tracks typically include samples and synthesized melodies with the typical tempo ranging from 150 to 180 bpm. Violence, drugs and profanity are common themes in mainstream hardcore, perceptible through its samples and lyrics, often screamed, pitch shifted, or distorted. 
Hardcore is popular in many countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Austria. It also has a newfound popularity in Australia and Brazil. In Germany, Mainstream hardcore parties often take place in the Ruhr area, as well as Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt.

Lady Chatterley's Lover is a novel by D. H. Lawrence, first published in 1928. The first edition was printed privately in Florence, Italy, with assistance from Pino Orioli; an unexpurgated edition could not be published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960. (A private edition was issued by Inky Stephensen's Mandrake Press in 1929.)[tpl]Citation | first = Barbara | last = Winter | title = The Australia-First Movement and the Publicist, 1936–1942 | place = Carindale, Queensland | publisher = Glass House | year = 2005 | ISBN = 1-876819-91-X[/tpl]. The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical (and emotional) relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its explicit descriptions of sex, and its use of then-unprintable words.
The story is said to have originated from events in Lawrence's own unhappy domestic life, and he took inspiration for the settings of the book from Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, where he grew up. According to some critics, the fling of Lady Ottoline Morrell with "Tiger", a young stonemason who came to carve plinths for her garden statues, also influenced the story.[tpl]Citation | first = Maev | last = Kennedy | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1891481,00.html | title = The real Lady Chatterley: society hostess loved and parodied by Bloomsbury group | newspaper = The Guardian | place = London,  ENG,  UK | date = 10 October 2006 | accessdate = 19 June 2008[/tpl]. Lawrence at one time considered calling the novel Tenderness and made significant alterations to the text and story in the process of its composition. It has been published in three versions.

Get Carter is a 1971 British crime film directed by Mike Hodges and starring Michael Caine, Ian Hendry,[tpl]cite web|title=Official Website of Ian Hendry|url=http://www.ianhendry.com|accessdate=6 July 2013[/tpl] Britt Ekland, John Osborne and Bryan Mosley. The screenplay was adapted by Hodges from Ted Lewis' 1969 novel Jack's Return Home. Producer Michael Klinger optioned the book and made a deal for the ailing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio to finance and release the film, bringing in Hodges and Caine. Caine became a co-producer of the film. Get Carter was Hodges' first feature film as director, as well as being the screen debut of Alun Armstrong. MGM was scaling back its European operations and the film became the last project approved before the American company closed its Borehamwood studios. The film is set in North East England and was filmed in and around Newcastle Upon Tyne, Gateshead, and County Durham.
The story follows a London gangster, the eponymous Jack Carter (Caine), who travels back to his hometown to discover more about the events surrounding his brother Frank's supposedly-accidental death. Suspecting foul play, he investigates and interrogates, getting a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element; with vengeance on his mind, the situation builds to a violent conclusion.[tpl]cite web|last=M|first=Dawson|title=British Masterpiece: Get Carter|url=http://www.leftfieldcinema.com/british-masterpiece-get-carter|work=Left Field Cinema|publisher=Left Field Cinema 2008 – 2009|accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl]
Caine and Hodges had ambitions to produce a more gritty and realistic portrayal of on-screen violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in a British film. Caine incorporated his knowledge of real criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter. Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky drew heavily on their backgrounds in documentary film. This, combined with Hodges' research into the contemporary criminal underworld of Newcastle (in particular the one-armed bandit murder) and use of hundreds of local bystanders as extras produced a naturalistic feel in many scenes. The shoot was incident free and progressed speedily, despite a one day strike by the Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians. The production went from novel to finished film in eight months, with location shooting lasting 40 days.
Get Carter suffered in its promotion, firstly from MGM's problems and secondly due to the declining British film industry of the period, which relied increasingly on US investment. Initial UK critical reaction to the film was mixed, with British reviewers grudgingly appreciative of the film's technical excellence, but dismayed by the complex plotting, the excessive violence and amorality, in particular Carter's apparent lack of remorse at his actions.[tpl]cite book |last=Mayer|first=Geoff|title=Guide to British Cinema (Reference Guides to the World's Cinema)|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-30307-4 |page=149 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7FOX_OWDyHEC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=get+carter+budget+mgm#v=onepage&q=get%20carter%20budget%20mgm&f=false[/tpl] Despite this the film did good business in the UK and produced a respectable profit. Conversely, US critics were generally more enthusiastic and praised the film, but it was poorly promoted in the States by United Artists and languished on the drive in circuit while MGM focused its resources on producing a blaxploitation remake, Hit Man. On its release the film received no awards and did not seem likely to be well remembered. However, despite its lack of availability on home media until 1993 it always maintained a cult following. Endorsements from a new generation of directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie[tpl]cite news |last=Crossan |first=Rob|title=Defining Moment: ‘Get Carter’ rewrites the gangster movie, March 1971 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25adefe8-9c0f-11de-b214-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1pJXFzqcD |accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=Financial Times Magazine|date=12 September 2009[/tpl] led to a critical reappraisal which saw it recognised as one of the best British movies of all time. In 1999, Get Carter was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in Total Film magazine chose it as the greatest British film of all time.[tpl]cite web|title=Get Carter tops British film poll |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3711460.stm |accessdate=6 April 2012 |publisher=BBC News|date=3 October 2004[/tpl] Get Carter was remade in 2000 by Warner Bros. under the same title, with Sylvester Stallone starring as Jack Carter, while Caine appears in a supporting role. This remake was not well received by critics in the USA and was not given a UK theatrical release.

Like a Virgin is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on November 12, 1984 by Sire Records. It was re-released worldwide in 1985, with the inclusion of the bonus track "Into the Groove". In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version with two bonus remix tracks. After the release of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to solidify her future in the music business, by building on the success of the first album. She decided to become one of the record producers, but Warner Bros. was not ready to give her the artistic freedom that she wanted. Nile Rodgers was chosen as the primary producer of the album, due to his work with David Bowie.
The album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic band mates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange of their help. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique introduced at that time. The cover sleeve and images were shot by Steven Meisel. Madonna wanted the album title and the cover image to make provocative link between her own religious name Madonna, as the Roman Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary, and the Christian concept of the virgin birth.
Like a Virgin is not that much of a musical departure from Madonna's first album, but she felt that the material was stronger. Along with Rodgers, Madonna also collaborated with her former boyfriend Steve Bray, who co-wrote many songs on the album. Consisting of dance-pop oriented music, the songs also incorporated New Wave. After its release, Like a Virgin received mixed reviews from the critics, but was a commercial success. It became Madonna's first number one album on the Billboard 200, while reaching the top of the charts in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it diamond for shipment of ten million copies across the United States. Worldwide it has sold 21 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.
Five singles were released from the album, with "Like a Virgin", "Material Girl" and "Into the Groove" becoming worldwide hits. To promote the album, Madonna embarked on The Virgin Tour, which had shows in cities of North America only. Like a Virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of the 80s. Madonna proved that she was not a one-hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in the music world. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population, especially "Material Girl" and "Like a Virgin". According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, "Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment".

[[Electrical element]]

CATEGORIES: Electronics, Electrical systems

Electrical elements are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electrical components, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, used in the analysis of electrical networks. Any electrical network can be analysed as multiple, interconnected electrical elements in a schematic diagram or circuit diagram, each of which affects the voltage in the network or current through the network. These ideal electrical elements represent real, physical electrical or electronic components but they do not exist physically and they are assumed to have ideal properties according to a lumped element model, while components are objects with less than ideal properties, a degree of uncertainty in their values and some degree of nonlinearity, each of which may require a combination of multiple electrical elements in order to approximate its function.
Circuit analysis using electric elements is useful for understanding many practical electrical networks using components. By analyzing the way a network is affected by its individual elements it is possible to estimate how a real network will behave.

A fictional country is a country that is made up for fictional stories, and does not exist in real life, or one that people believe in without proof. 
Sailors have always mistaken low clouds for land masses, and in later times this was given the name Dutch capes.Schott's Quintessential Miscellany, p119 ISBN 978-1-4088-1577-9
Other fictional lands appear most commonly as settings or subjects of myth, literature, movies, or video games. They may also be used for technical reasons in actual reality for use in the development of specifications, such as the fictional country of Bookland, which is used to allow EAN "country" codes 978 and 979 to be used for ISBN numbers assigned to books, and code 977 to be assigned for use for ISSN numbers on magazines and other periodicals.  Also, the ISO 3166 country code "ZZ" is reserved as a fictional country code,[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] thus no Internet top-level domain will ever end in ".ZZ".
Fictional countries appear commonly in stories of early science fiction (or scientific romance). Such countries supposedly form part of the normal Earth landscape although not located in a normal atlas. Later similar tales often took place on fictional planets.
Jonathan Swift's protagonist, Lemuel Gulliver, visited various strange places. Edgar Rice Burroughs placed adventures of Tarzan in areas in Africa that, at the time, remained mostly unknown to the West and to the East. Isolated islands with strange creatures and/or customs enjoyed great popularity in these authors' times. By the 19th century, when Western explorers had surveyed most of the Earth's surface, this option was lost to Western culture. Thereafter fictional utopian and dystopian societies tended to spring up on other planets or in space, whether in human colonies or in alien societies originating elsewhere. Fictional countries can also be used in stories set in a distant future, with other political borders than today.
Superhero and secret agent comics and some thrillers also use fictional countries on Earth as backdrops. Most of these countries exist only for a single story, a TV-series episode or an issue of a comic book. There are notable exceptions, such as Qumar and Equatorial Kundu in The West Wing, Marvel Comics Latveria and DC Comics Qurac and Bialya.

Suxamethonium chloride (INN), also known as suxamethonium or succinylcholine, is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, used to induce muscle relaxation and short-term paralysis, usually to facilitate tracheal intubation. Suxamethonium is sold under the trade names Anectine and Quelicin. It is sometimes used in combination with analgesics and sedatives for euthanasia and immobilization of horses.  It is colloquially referred to as "sux" in hospital settings.[tpl]cite journal |last=Lee |first=C |coauthors=Katz R. |title=Clinical implications of new neuromuscular concepts and agents: So long, neostigmine!

Suxamethonium acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. It acts on nicotinic receptors resulting in persistent depolarization of the motor end plate. It is degraded by butyrylcholinesterase, a plasma cholinesterase. This hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase is much slower than that of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase.

A local anesthetic (LA) is a drug that causes reversible local anesthesia, generally for the aim of having a local analgesic effect, that is, inducing absence of pain sensation, although other local senses are often affected as well. Also, when it is used on specific nerve pathways (local anesthetic nerve block), paralysis (loss of muscle power) can be achieved as well.
Clinical local anesthetics belong to one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester local anesthetics. Synthetic local anesthetics are structurally related to cocaine. They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have no abuse potential and do not produce hypertension or (with few exceptions) vasoconstriction.
Local anesthetics are used in various techniques of local anesthesia such as:

[[Zero insertion force]]

CATEGORIES: CPU sockets

Zero insertion force (ZIF) is a type of  IC socket or electrical connector that requires very little force for insertion. With a ZIF socket, before the IC is inserted, a lever or slider on the side of the socket is moved, pushing all the sprung contacts apart so that the IC can be inserted with very little force - generally the weight of the IC itself is sufficient and no external downward force is required. The lever is then moved back, allowing the contacts to close and grip the pins of the IC. ZIF sockets are much more expensive than standard IC sockets and also tend to take up a larger board area due to the space taken up by the lever mechanism. Therefore they are only used when there is a good reason to do so.

[[Socket 7]]

CATEGORIES: CPU sockets

Socket 7 is a physical and electrical specification for an x86-style CPU socket on a personal computer motherboard. The socket supersedes the earlier Socket 5, and accepts P5  Pentium microprocessors manufactured by Intel, as well as compatibles made by Cyrix/IBM, AMD, IDT and others.[tpl]Citation |title=Intel Socket 7 Specification |publisher=pcguide.com |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/cpu/char/socketSocket7-c.html |accessdate=2009-03-31[/tpl]
Socket 7 was the only socket that supported a wide range of CPUs from different manufacturers and a wide range of speeds.
Differences between Socket 5 and Socket 7 are that Socket 7 has an extra pin and is designed to provide dual split rail voltage, as opposed to Socket 5's single voltage. (However, not all motherboard manufacturers supported the dual voltage on their boards initially.) Socket 7 is backwards compatible; a Socket 5 CPU can be placed in a Socket 7 motherboard.
Processors that used Socket 7 are the AMD K5 and K6, the Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX, the IDT WinChip, the Intel  P5  Pentium (2.5–3.5 V, 75–200 MHz), the Pentium MMX (166–233 MHz), and the Rise Technology mP6. Current AMD Geode LX and Geode GX still use Socket 7.
Socket 7 typically uses a 321-pin (arranged as 19 by 19 pins) SPGA ZIF socket or the very rare 296-pin (arranged as 37 by 37 pins) SPGA LIF socket.
An extension of Socket 7, Super Socket 7, was developed by AMD for their K6-2 and K6-III processors to operate at a higher clock rate and use AGP.

[[Relational calculus]]

CATEGORIES: Logical calculi, Relational model

Relational calculus consists of two calculi, the tuple relational calculus and the domain relational calculus, that are part of the relational model for databases and provide a declarative way to specify database queries. This in contrast to the relational algebra which is also part of the relational model but provides a more procedural way for specifying queries.
The relational algebra might suggest these steps to retrieve the phone numbers and names of book stores that supply Some Sample Book:
The relational calculus would formulate a descriptive, declarative way:
The relational algebra and the relational calculus are essentially logically equivalent: for any algebraic expression, there is an equivalent expression in the calculus, and vice versa. This result is known as Codd's theorem.

Guided by Voices (often abbreviated as GBV) is an American indie rock band originating from Dayton, Ohio. Beginning with the band's formation in 1983 at the Northridge High School,http://www.stillinrock.com/2014/03/album-review-guided-by-voices.html it made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Robert Pollard. Guided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004, though many of its former members remain musically involved in solo careers or other projects.
Noted at first for its lo-fi aesthetic and typically Portastudio four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music revealed influences from post-British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, punk rock and post-punk. The band also garnered much attention for its prolific output, with a seemingly endless stream of releases. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade sound effects.
In 2010, the "classic lineup" of Guided by Voices reunited to perform at Matador Records 21st anniversary party, and subsequently undertook a national tour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.buzzgrinder.com/2010/guided-by-voices-reunion-tour-confirmed-no-dates-announced-yet/ |title=Guided By Voices Reunion Tour Confirmed, No Dates Announced Yet |publisher=Buzzgrinder.com |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2011-12-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] Since reforming, the band has released numerous new albums.

There are far more stories about her than there are facts. She was likely much younger than Socrates, perhaps by as much as forty years.She must have been young enough to give birth to their three children Plato describes in his writings:  In the Apology 34d, the sons are described as quite young: two of them "children", the other a "lad"; in Plato's Phaedo 60a, one of them is small enough to be held in his mother's arms.

Easter Road is a football stadium located in the Leith area of Edinburgh, Scotland, which is the home ground of Scottish Premiership club Hibernian (Hibs).

Hibs first played at the present site of Easter Road in 1893. The record attendance of 65,860, when the stadium had vast terracing sections, was set by an Edinburgh derby on 2 January 1950. The size of the terracing was greatly reduced in the 1980s.  After the publication of the Taylor Report, Hibs considered leaving Easter Road and moving to a different site, but these plans were abandoned in 1994.

William Cobbett (9 March 1763 – 18 June 1835) was an English pamphleteer, farmer and journalist, who was born in Farnham, Surrey. He believed that reforming Parliament and abolishing the rotten boroughs would help to end the poverty of farm labourers, and he attacked the borough-mongers, sinecurists and "tax-eaters" relentlessly.  He was also against the Corn Laws, a tax on imported grain. Early in his career, he was a loyalist supporter of King and Country: but later he joined and successfully publicised the radical movement, which led to the Reform Bill of 1832, and to his winning the parliamentary seat of Oldham.  Although he was not a Catholic, he became a fiery advocate of Catholic Emancipation in Britain.  Through the seeming contradictions in Cobbett's life, his opposition to authority stayed constant. He wrote many polemics, on subjects from political reform to religion, but is best known for his book from 1830, Rural Rides, which is still in print today.

[[Granular synthesis]]
CATEGORIES: Sound synthesis types

Granular synthesis is a basic sound synthesis method that operates on the microsound time scale.

It is based on the same principle as sampling. However, the samples are not played back conventionally, but are instead split into small pieces of around 1 to 50 ms. These small pieces are called grains. Multiple grains may be layered on top of each other, and may play at different speeds, phases, volume, and frequency, among other parameters.
At low speeds of playback, the result is a kind of soundscape, often described as a cloud, that is manipulatable in a manner unlike that for natural sound sampling or other synthesis techniques. At high speeds, the result is heard as a note or notes of a novel timbre. By varying the waveform, envelope, duration, spatial position, and density of the grains, many different sounds can be produced.

Both have been used for musical purposes: as sound effects, raw material for further processing by other synthesis or digital signal processing effects, or as complete musical works in their own right. Conventional effects that can be achieved include amplitude modulation and time stretching. More experimentally, stereo or multichannel scattering, random reordering, disintegration and morphing are possible.

Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus (519 BC – 430 BC) was a Roman aristocrat and statesman whose service as consul in 460 BC and dictator in 458 BC and 439 BC made him a model of civic virtue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/rulersleaderskings/p/Cincinnatus.htm |title=Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus |publisher=About.com |author=N.S. Gill |accessdate=2008-08-25[/tpl]
Cincinnatus was regarded by the Romans, especially the aristocratic patrician class, as one of the heroes of early Rome and as a model of Roman virtue and simplicity. He was a persistent opponent of the plebeians.[tpl]cite web|title=The Early Roman Republic|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/republic/earlyrep-index.html|accessdate=11 September 2012[/tpl]  When his son, Caeso Quinctius, was convicted and condemned to death, Cincinnatus was forced to live in humble circumstances, working on his own small farm, until an invasion caused him to be called to serve Rome as dictator, an office which he resigned two weeks later, after completing his task of defeating the rivaling tribes of the Aequians, Sabines, and Volscians.
His immediate resignation of his near-absolute authority with the end of the crisis has often been cited as an example of outstanding leadership, service to the greater good, civic virtue, lack of personal ambition and modesty. As a result, he has inspired a number of organizations and other entities, many of which are named in his honor.

[[Biot number]]

CATEGORIES: Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics, Dimensionless numbers of thermodynamics, Heat conduction

The Biot number (Bi) is a dimensionless quantity used in heat transfer calculations. It is named after the French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774–1862), and gives a simple index of the ratio of the heat transfer resistances inside of and at the surface of a body. This ratio determines whether or not the temperatures inside a body will vary significantly in space, while the body heats or cools over time, from a thermal gradient applied to its surface.
In general, problems involving small Biot numbers (much smaller than 1) are thermally simple, due to uniform temperature fields inside the body. Biot numbers much larger than 1 signal more difficult problems due to non-uniformity of temperature fields within the object.
The Biot number has a variety of applications, including transient heat transfer and use in extended surface heat transfer calculations.

[[Divine simplicity]]

CATEGORIES: Christian philosophy, Jewish mysticism, Jewish philosophy, Judeo-Christian topics, Thomas Aquinas, Attributes of God in Christian theology, Conceptions of God

In theology, the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is without parts.  The general idea of divine simplicity can be stated in this way: the being of God is identical to the "attributes" of God.  In other words, such characteristics as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical to God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities inhering in God as in a substance. Varieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of scholasticism, though the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' Enneads as the Simplex.Bussanich John, Plotinus's metaphysics of the One in The Cambridge Companion to Plotinus, ed. Lloyd P.Gerson, p.42, 1996, Cambridge University Press, UK.

Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|m[/tpl]), KT, PC (2 July 1903 – 9 October 1995) was a British Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister from October 1963 to October 1964.  He is notable for being the last Prime Minister to hold office while being a member of the House of Lords, prior to renouncing his peerage and taking up a seat in the House of Commons for the remainder of his premiership. His reputation, however, rests more on his two spells as the UK's foreign minister than on his brief premiership.
Within six years of first entering the House of Commons in 1931, Douglas-Home (then called by the  courtesy title  Lord Dunglass) became parliamentary aide to Neville Chamberlain, witnessing at first hand Chamberlain's efforts as Prime Minister to preserve peace through appeasement in the two years before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1940 Dunglass was diagnosed with spinal tuberculosis and was immobilised for two years. By the later stages of the war he had recovered enough to resume his political career, but lost his seat in the general election of 1945. He regained it in 1950, but the following year he left the Commons when, on the death of his father, he inherited the earldom of Home and thereby became a member of the House of Lords. Under the premierships of Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan he was appointed to a series of increasingly senior posts, including Leader of the House of Lords and Foreign Secretary. In the latter post, which he held from 1960 to 1963, he supported United States resolve in the Cuban missile crisis and was the United Kingdom's signatory of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in August 1963.
In October 1963 Macmillan was taken ill and resigned as Prime Minister. Home was chosen to succeed him. By the 1960s it was generally considered unacceptable for a Prime Minister to sit in the House of Lords, and Home renounced his earldom and successfully stood for election to the House of Commons. The manner of his appointment was controversial, and two of Macmillan's cabinet ministers refused to take office under him. He was criticised by the Labour Party as an aristocrat, out of touch with the problems of ordinary families, and he came over stiffly in television interviews, by contrast with the Labour leader, Harold Wilson. The Conservative Party, in office since 1951, had lost standing as a result of a sexual scandal involving a defence minister in 1963, and at the time of Home's appointment as Prime Minister seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat. Home's premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of resale price maintenance, bringing costs down for the consumer against the interests of producers of food and other commodities.
After narrow defeat in the general election of 1964 Douglas-Home resigned the leadership of his party, having instituted a new and less secretive method of electing the party leader. From 1970 to 1974 he served in the cabinet of Edward Heath as Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, an expanded version of the post of Foreign Secretary, which he had held earlier.  After the defeat of the Heath government in 1974 he returned to the House of Lords as a life peer, and retired from front-line politics.

Quiriguá ([tpl]IPA-es|kiɾiˈɣwa[/tpl]) is an ancient Maya archaeological site in the department of Izabal in south-eastern Guatemala. It is a medium-sized site covering approximately [tpl]convert|3|km2|sqmi[/tpl] along the lower Motagua River,Ashmore 1980, p.24. with the ceremonial center about [tpl]convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|1[/tpl] from the north bank. During the Maya Classic Period (AD 200–900), Quiriguá was situated at the juncture of several important trade routes. The site was occupied by 200, construction on the acropolis had begun by about 550, and an explosion of grander construction started in the 8th century. All construction had halted by about 850, except for a brief period of reoccupation in the Early Postclassic (c. 900 – c. 1200). Quiriguá shares its architectural and sculptural styles with the nearby Classic Period city of Copán, with whose history it is closely entwined.Miller 1999, p.49.
Quiriguá's rapid expansion in the 8th century was tied to king K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat's military victory over Copán in 738. When the greatest king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil or "18-Rabbit", was defeated, he was captured and then sacrificed in the Great Plaza at Quiriguá.Looper 2003, pp.4–5, 83. Before this, Quiriguá had been a vassal state of Copán, but it maintained its independence afterwards. The ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá is quite modest, but the site's importance lies in its wealth of sculpture, including the tallest stone monumental sculpture ever erected in the New World.

Steptoe and Son is a British sitcom written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson about a father-and-son rag-and-bone business.  They live on Oil Drum Lane, a fictional street in Shepherd's Bush, London. Four series were broadcast by the BBC from 1962 to 1965, followed by a second run from 1970 to 1974. Its theme tune, "Old Ned", was composed by Ron Grainer.[tpl]citation |contribution=Ron Grainer: Biography |url=http://www.rongrainer.org.uk/bio.php |publisher=www.rongrainer.org.uk |accessdate=20 September 2010[/tpl] The series was voted 15th in a 2004 BBC poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom.[tpl]citation |contribution=Best comedy series |url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/articles/comedy.html |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=24 September 2007[/tpl] It was remade in the US as Sanford and Son, in Sweden as Albert & Herbert and in the Netherlands as Stiefbeen en zoon. In 1972 a movie adaptation of the series, Steptoe and Son, was released in cinemas, with a second Steptoe and Son Ride Again in 1973.
The series focussed on the inter-generational conflict of father and son. Albert Steptoe, a "dirty old man", is an old rag and bone man, set in his grimy and grasping ways. By contrast his 37-year-old son Harold is filled with social aspirations, not to say pretensions. The show contained elements of drama and tragedy, as Harold was continually prevented from achieving his ambitions. To this end the show was unusual at the time for casting actors rather than comedians in its lead roles, although both actors were drawn into more comedic roles as a consequence.

[[Groovebox]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic musical instruments, Grooveboxes

The term Groovebox was originally used by Roland corporation to refer to its MC-303,[ref]
</ref> but the term has since entered general use.<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/search?Keyword=groovebox ''Sound on Sound'' articles on grooveboxes]</ref> It refers to a self-contained instrument for the production of live, loop-based electronic music with a high degree of user control facilitating improvisation.
A groovebox consists of three integrated elements. 
The integration of these elements into a single system allows the musician to rapidly construct and control a pattern-based sequence, often with multiple instrumental or percussion voices playing simultaneously.
These sequences may also be chained together into a song in a live and immediate way.  Provision may be made for sequences and songs to be saved, retrieved from memory, and inserted into the current performance whilst playing. In some cases, an entire musical performance may be created by a single player with a single groovebox.  In other cases, the groovebox is simply one instrument amongst many. This is reflected by the large variety of grooveboxes available, ranging from Roland's lower-end MC and SP products with include basic sequencing and sampling capabilities, to Akai's flagship MPC 4000 and 5000, Yamaha's RS7000 or Roland's own MV-8800 which include features such as high-end sampling, high-polyphony synthesizers, and extensive sequencing, connection and storage possibilities.
Groovebox style instruments have facilitated many performers, both amateur and professional, who may have previously been unfamiliar with electronic music, to explore the genre.  Whilst some in the genre initially derided these instruments (in particular the MC-303) and the opening of the field as leading to a drop in standards, they are now generally accepted as having a legitimate place in the form.
In addition, many performers and bands from outside the electronic community have integrated groovebox instruments into their shows, as a convenient way of incorporating electronic sound into a more traditional format.
The sequencer and control aspects of a groovebox may be used to control an external instrument over MIDI, and the internal voices may similarly be controlled by external equipment.
A groovebox is similar to a music workstation.  The general differences are that it will often omit, or include only a simplified keyboard, is designed to be portable, and will usually include more user controls.  Whereas a workstation is often targeted towards studio musicians and composers, grooveboxes are designed more to suit the needs of live performers.  However, units matching either description are used both on stage and in the studio.
A defining characteristic of a groovebox is the ability for the performer to alter both the sequence and the sound parameters in real time, without interruption of the performance.  Units marketed as such, which have failed to implement this feature correctly, or at all, have not been well received.
Grooveboxes may also be compared to drum machines such as the earlier Roland TR series (606, 808, 909 etc.), or to their TB-303, and the term has retroactively been applied to such units.

[[Château de la Bourdaisière]]

CATEGORIES: Châteaux in Indre-et-Loire, Official historical monuments of France, Hotels in France

The Château de la Bourdaisière is a castle in the countryside in the Commune of Montlouis-sur-Loire, in the Indre-et-Loire département of France.
Its origins date back to the 14th century when it was a fortress belonging to Jean Meingre. Over the next few generations, the property changed hands several time, until 1520 when King Francis I arranged for construction of a new castle on the site. Built for his mistress, Marie Gaudin, the wife of Philibert Babou, Superintendent of Finances for France, after her death, the property would remain in the family's hands.
Marie Gaudin's granddaughter, Gabrielle d'Estrées, was born in the château and would herself grow up to become mistress to another king, Henry IV of France.
In 1775, the château was partially destroyed by order of King Louis XV's most powerful Minister, Étienne François, Duc de Choiseul. Étienne François wanted to use the stones from Château de la Bourdaisière for the construction of his Pagoda at his estate in Chanteloup, near Amboise.
Lying in ruins, in 1786 the land was sold to Louise Adélaïde of Penthièvre Bourbon. In 1802 the property was acquired by Baron Joseph Angelier who undertook a massive reconstruction of Château Bourdaisière. The interior work would be completed by his son, Gustave Angelier. Although a small château, when compared to the great châteaux of the Kings and some of those built by other wealthy nobles, it is a magnificent Renaissance construction fronted by traditional French gardens.
The Castle was sold in 1923 to a wealthy American,  Mrs. de Mérinville who sold it in 1938. During World War II, the château was occupied by the Nazis. After the war, a lack of funds by its owner saw it become severely run down. In 1959, its contents were auctioned off and government turned the château into a home for the elderly.
It was sold again in 1988 to an attorney, François Michaud, who owned it until 1991 when it was acquired by its current owners, the Princes of Broglie who undertook significant improvements and modernization. In 2003, Château de la Bourdaisière gained considerable attention in North America, as the primary site for the television show Joe Millionaire. In 2011, the chateaus gardens were finalist for the European Garden Award bestowed by the European Garden Heritage Networkhttp://cmsen.eghn.org/egp2011
The château was listed as a monument historique in 1947.http://www.labourdaisiere.com/en/le-chateau/historique

[[Religious persecution]]

CATEGORIES: Massacres of Sikhs, Religious persecution, Religion and society, Religious pluralism

Religious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group of individuals as a response to their religious beliefs or affiliations or lack thereof.
The tendency of societies or groups within society to alienate or repress different subcultures is a recurrent theme in human history. Moreover, because a person's religion often determines to a significant extent his or her morality, worldview, self-image, attitudes towards others, and overall personal identity, religious differences can be significant cultural, personal, and social factors.
Religious persecution may be triggered by religious bigotry (i.e. the denigration of practitioners' religions other than those of the oppressors) or by the State when it views a particular religious group as a threat to its interests or security. At a societal level, this dehumanization of a particular religious group may readily turn into violence or other forms of persecution. Indeed, in many countries, religious persecution has resulted in so much violence that it is considered a human rights problem.

The inflicting of suffering, harassment, isolation, imprisonment, fear, or pain are all factors that may establish persecution. Even so, not all suffering will necessarily establish persecution. The suffering experienced by the victim must be sufficiently severe. The threshold level of severity has been a source of much debate.S.

George Joseph Herriman (August 22, 1880 – April 25, 1944) was an American cartoonist best known for the comic strip Krazy Kat (1913–1944).  More influential than popular, Krazy Kat had an appreciative audience among people in the arts. Gilbert Seldes' article "The Krazy Kat Who Walks by Himself" was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip. The Comics Journal placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century. Herriman's work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as Will Eisner, Charles M. Schulz, Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Bill Watterson, and Chris Ware.
Herriman was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to mulatto Creole parents, and grew up in Los Angeles.  After he graduated from high school in 1897, he was employed in the newspaper industry as an illustrator and engraver.  He moved on to cartooning and comic strips—a medium then in its infancy—and drew a variety of strips until he introduced his most famous character, Krazy Kat, in his strip The Dingbat Family in 1910.  A Krazy Kat daily strip began in 1913, and from 1916 also appeared on Sundays.  The strip was noted for its poetic, dialect-heavy dialogue; its fantastic, shifting backgrounds; and its bold, experimental page layouts.  In the strip's main motif, Ignatz Mouse would pelt Krazy with bricks, which the naïve, androgynous Kat would interpret as symbols of love. As the strip progressed, a love triangle developed between Krazy, Ignatz and Offisa Pupp.
Herriman lived most of his life in Los Angeles, but made frequent trips to the Navajo deserts in the southwestern U.S.  He was drawn to the landscapes of Monument Valley and the Enchanted Mesa, and made Coconino County the location of his Krazy Kat strips.  His artwork made much use of Navajo and Mexican themes and motifs against shifting desert backgrounds.  He was a prolific cartoonist who produced a large number of strips and illustrated Don Marquis's books of poetry about Archy and Mehitabel, an alley cat and a cockroach.  Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst was a proponent of Herriman and gave him a lifetime contract with King Features Syndicate, guaranteeing Herriman a comfortable living and an outlet for his work despite its lack of popularity.

[[Walter Knott]]

Walter Marvin Knott (December 11, 1889 – December 3, 1981) was an American farmer who created the Knott's Berry Farm amusement park in California and made Knott's Berry Farm jelly. 
Knott was born in San Bernardino, California,Nygaard, Norman E., Walter Knott: Twentieth Century Pioneer, pp. 93–100, Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, MI, 1965. and grew up in Pomona, California.  In the 1920s, Knott was a somewhat unsuccessful farmer whose fortunes changed when he nursed several abandoned berry plants back to health. The hybrid boysenberry, named after its creator, Rudolph Boysen, was a cross between a blackberry, red raspberry and loganberry. The huge berries were a hit, and the Knott family sold berries, preserves and pies from a Buena Park, California roadside stand.  In 1934, Knott's wife Cordelia (née Hornaday, January 23, 1890 – April 12, 1974) began serving fried chicken dinners, and within a few years, lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long.Merritt, Christopher and Lynxwiler, J. Eric, Knott's Preserved: From Boysenberry to Theme Park, the History of Knott's Berry Farm, pp. 20–31, Angel City Press, Santa Monica, CA, 2010.  
To entertain the waiting crowds, Walter built a Ghost Town in 1940, using buildings relocated from Old West towns. Even after Disneyland opened in 1955 a mere [tpl]convert|8|mi|km[/tpl] away, Knott's Berry Farm continued to thrive. Walt Disney and Walter Knott are rumored to have had a cordial relationship; it is known that they each visited the other's park, and they were both members of the original planning council for Children's Hospital of Orange County. Early additions to the farm included the Ghost Town & Calico Railway, a narrow gauge railroad in the Ghost Town area, a San Francisco cable car, a Pan-for-Gold attraction, the Calico Mine Train dark ride and the Timber Mountain Log Ride log flume ride.  In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged admission for the first time, and Knott's Berry Farm officially became an amusement park.Holmes, Roger and Bailey, Paul, Fabulous Farmer: The Story of Walter Knott and his Berry Farm, pp. 125–52, Westernlore Press, Los Angeles, CA, 1956. 
Because of his interest in American pioneer history, Knott purchased and restored the real silver mining ghost town of Calico, California in 1951.  As a child Walter spent a lot of time in Calico living with his uncle. During World War I he helped to build a silver mill in Calico. This period in his life influenced his decision to buy the town and restore it. In 1966, he deeded Calico to San Bernardino County, California.Kooiman, Helen, Walter Knott: Keeper of the Flame, pp. 153–58, Plycon Press, Fullerton, CA, 1973. 
Walter remained active in the operation of Knott's Berry Farm until the death of Cordelia in 1974, at which point he turned his attention toward political causes,Kooiman, Helen, Walter Knott: Keeper of the Flame, pp. 171–84, Plycon Press, Fullerton, CA, 1973.Salts, Christiane Victoria, Cordelia Knott: Pioneering Business Woman, pp. 75–78, The Literature Connection Books, Buena Park, CA, 2009. leaving day-to-day park operations to his children. He died in Buena Park, CA, and is buried at Loma Vista Cemetery in Fullerton, California. 
The Knott family today no longer owns the theme park; it has since been sold to the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company.  Additionally, The J.M. Smucker Co. now owns the "Knott's Berry Farm" brand of jam and jelly (purchased from ConAgra Foods in 2008).Merritt, Christopher and Lynxwiler, J.

Skaro is a fictional planet in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was created by the writer Terry Nation as the home planet of the Daleks. As with all information relating to the Whoniverse, the canonical status of that derived from spin-off media, rather than the programme itself, is debatable.
In The Daleks (1963) Skaro is described as being the twelfth planet from its sun, while in Genesis of the Daleks (1975) it is stated that Skaro is situated in the "Seventh Galaxy".

[[Caliber]]
CATEGORIES: Ammunition, Firearms, Units of length

In guns, particularly firearms, caliber or calibre is the approximate internal diameter of the barrel, or the diameter of the projectile it fires. In a rifled barrel, the distance is measured between opposing lands or grooves; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States, while land measurements are more common elsewhere.  Good performance requires that a bullet closely match the groove diameter of a barrel to ensure a good seal.  When the barrel diameter is given in inches, the abbreviation "cal" is used in place of "inches." For example, a small bore rifle with a diameter of 0.22 inch is a .22 cal; however, the decimal point is generally dropped when spoken, making it "twenty-two caliber" or a "two-two caliber".  Calibers of firearms can be referred to in millimeters, as in a "caliber of eighty-eight millimeters" (88 mm) or "a hundred and five-millimeter caliber gun" (often abbreviated as "105 mm gun").
While modern cartridges and cartridge firearms are generally referred to by the cartridge name, they are still lumped together based on bore diameter. For example, a firearm might be described as a .30 caliber rifle, which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly .30 inch projectile; or a ".22 rimfire", referring to any rimfire cartridge using a .22 caliber projectile.
Firearm calibers outside the range of .17 to .50 (4.5 to 12.7 mm) exist, but are rarely encountered. Wildcat cartridges, for example, can be found in .10, .12, and .14 caliber (2.5, 3.0, & 3.6 mm), typically used for short range varmint hunting, where the high velocity, lightweight bullets provide devastating terminal ballistics with little risk of ricochet. Larger calibers, such as .577, .585, .600, .700, and .729 (12.7, 14.7, 14.9, 15.2, 17.8, & 18.5 mm) are generally found in proprietary cartridges chambered in express rifles or similar guns intended for use on dangerous game.[tpl]cite book |title=Cartridges of the World, 10th Ed. |publisher=Krause Publications |author=Frank C. Barnes, ed. Stan Skinner |isbn=0-87349-605-1[/tpl] 950 JDJ is the only known cartridge beyond .79 caliber used in a rifle.
In some contexts,  e.g. guns aboard a warship, "caliber" is used to describe the barrel length as multiples of the bore diameter. A "5-inch 50 calibre" gun has a bore diameter of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and a barrel length of 50 times 5 inches = 250 inches (6.35 m).

The College of William & Mary in Virginia (also known as The College,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] William & Mary, or W&M) is a public research university located in Williamsburg, Virginia, United States. Privately founded in 1693 by letters patent issued by King William III and Queen Mary II, it is the second-oldest institution of higher education in the United States after Harvard University. William & Mary is considered one of the original "Public Ivies," a publicly funded university providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League.[tpl]cite book|last=Moll |first=Richard |title=Public Ivys: A Guide to America's best public undergraduate colleges and universities |year=1985[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Greene, Howard and Matthew |title=The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities |year=2001[/tpl]
William & Mary educated U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler as well as other key figures important to the development of the nation, including U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, Speaker of the House Henry Clay, and 16 signers of the Declaration of Independence. W&M founded the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society in 1776 and was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an honor code of conduct for students. The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 make it one of the first universities in the United States.
In addition to its undergraduate program (which includes a joint degree program with the University of St Andrews and a joint engineering program with Columbia University), W&M is home to several graduate and professional schools, including law, business, public policy, education, marine science and colonial history.

Overclocking is the process of making a computer or component operate faster than the clock frequency specified by the manufacturer by modifying system parameters (hence the name "overclocking"). Operating voltages may also be changed (increased), which can increase the speed at which operation remains stable. Most overclocking techniques increase power consumption, generating more heat, which must be dispersed if the chip is to remain operational.

[[Octatonic scale]]

CATEGORIES: Musical scales, Musical symmetry, Post-tonal music theory, Persian music

An octatonic scale is any eight-note musical scale. Among the most famous of these is a scale in which the notes ascend in alternating intervals of a whole step and a half step, creating a symmetric scale. In classical theory, in contradistinction to jazz theory, this scale is commonly simply called the octatonic scale, although there are forty-two other non-enharmonically equivalent, non-transpositionally equivalent eight-tone sets possible. In jazz theory this scale is more particularly called the diminished scale (Campbell 2001, p. 126), or symmetric diminished scale (Hatfield 2005, p. 125), because it can be conceived as a combination of two interlocking diminished seventh chords, just as the augmented scale can be conceived as a combination of two interlocking augmented triads. The earliest systematic treatment of the octatonic scale was Edmond de Polignac's unpublished treatise, "Etude sur les successions alternantes de tons et demi-tons (Et sur la gamme dite majeure-mineure)" from c. 1879 (Kahan 2009), which preceded Vito Frazzi's Scale alternate per pianoforte of 1930 by a full half-century (Sanguinetti 1993). The term octatonic pitch collection was first introduced into English by Arthur Berger in 1963 (Van den Toorn 1983).

[[Altered scale]]
CATEGORIES: Heptatonic scales

In jazz, the altered scale or altered dominant scale is a seven-note scale that differs from the Locrian mode in having a lowered fourth scale degree. Starting on C, it contains the notes: C, D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl], E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl], F[tpl]music|flat[/tpl], G[tpl]music|flat[/tpl], A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] and B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]. (This is the C Locrian mode, C-D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-F-G[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl], with F changed to F[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]. For this reason, the altered scale is sometimes called the "super locrian mode".)  It is the seventh mode of the ascending melodic minor scale. The scale is sometimes spelled with two thirds rather than a flatted fourth scale degree—e.g. C-D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-E[tpl]music|natural[/tpl]-G[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl], with E[tpl]music|natural[/tpl] substituting for F[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]. In contrast to the term acoustic scale, the term "altered scale" almost always refers to this particular mode of the melodic minor, rather than the scale itself. In this sense, the term "altered mode" would be more accurate.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] The altered scale is also known as the Pomeroy scale (Bahha & Rawlins  2005, 33) (after Herb Pomeroy (Miller 1996, 35)), the Ravel scale (after Ravel), and the diminished whole-tone scale (due to its resemblance to the diminished scale and the whole-tone scale) (Haerle 1975, 15) as well as the dominant whole-tone scale and Locrian flat four (Service 1993, 28).
The altered scale appears sporadically in the works of Debussy and Ravel (Tymoczko 1997), as well as in the works of recent composers such as Steve Reich (see, in particular, the Desert Music). It plays a fundamental role in jazz, where it is used to accompany altered dominant seventh chords starting on the first scale degree. (That is, the scale C-D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-F[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-G[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] is used to accompany chords such as C-E-G[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl], the dominant seventh flat five flat nine chord.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] See: chord-scale system.
The C super locrian scale consists of the notes C D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] F[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] G[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] C
One way to obtain the altered scale is by raising the tonic of a major scale by a half step; for example, taking the tonic of the B-major scale, B C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] D[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] E F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] G[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] A[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] B
raising the tonic by a half step produces the C altered scale, C C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] D[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] E F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] G[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] A[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] C
the notes of which are enharmonic (identical, in the equal temperament system) with the notes of the C altered scale.
Like the other modes of the melodic minor ascending or jazz minor scale, the altered scale shares six of its seven notes with an octatonic (or "diminished") scale, and five of the six notes of a whole-tone scale, and thus is occasionally referred to as the "diminished whole tone scale". (For example, the altered scale C-D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-F[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-G[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] shares all but its A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] with the octatonic scale C-D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-E[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-E-F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]-G-A-B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]; while sharing five of the six notes in the whole-tone scale C-D-E-G[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-A[tpl]music|flat[/tpl]-B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl].) This accounts for some of its popularity in both the classical and jazz traditions (Callender 1998,[tpl]Page needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]; Tymoczko 2004[tpl]Page needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]).

Heinrich Kramer ([tpl]circa[/tpl] 1430 – 1505), also known under the Latinized name Henricus Institor,"Institoris" is the Latin genitive case of "Institor" ("retailer"). It was a common practice in those times to take the genitive of the father's name for latinization, but this genitive was used as nominative in Latin texts ("Venerabilis & religiosus frater Henricus institoris"). In German texts this name was abridged to "Institor", according to the custom of omitting Latin endings in translations (cf. "Iuvenalis" – "Juvenal").Paul Hinschius. Das Kirchenrecht der Katholiken und Protestanten in Deutschland. Band VI. 1897. Reprint Guttentag, 1959. was a German churchman and inquisitor.
Born in Sélestat, Alsace, he joined the Dominican Order at an early age and while still a young man was appointed Prior of the Dominican house of his native town.
At some date before 1474 he was appointed Inquisitor for the Tyrol, Salzburg, Bohemia and Moravia. His eloquence in the pulpit and tireless activity received recognition at Rome and he was the right-hand man of the Archbishop of Salzburg. By the time of the Bull Summis desiderantes of Pope Innocent VIII in 1484 he was already associated with Jacob Sprenger to make an inquisition for witches and sorcerers. In 1485 he drew up a treatise on witchcraft which was incorporated in the Malleus Maleficarum (literally "The Hammer of Witches").
Kramer failed in his attempt to obtain endorsement for this work from the top theologians of the Inquisition at the Faculty of Cologne, and they condemned the book as recommending unethical and illegal procedures, as well as being inconsistent with Catholic doctrines of demonology.
In 1495 he was summoned to Venice to give public lectures, which were very popular. In 1500 he was empowered to proceed against the Waldensians and Picards.
He died in either Brünn or Olmütz, in Moravia, in 1505.

Carpetbag steak or carpetbagger steak is a luxury dish, probably of American derivation, popular in the 1950s and 1960s in Australia[ref]
Carpetbag Steak, Bert Newton, 1960s,  Food and space: the Australian nation in the British Empire[/ref]  and New Zealand.Horopito Carpetbag Steak Anne Thorpe
It consists of an end cut of steak, such as scotch fillet. A pocket in the meat is made, into which oysters are stuffed and sutured with toothpicks or thread.
The combination of beef and oysters is traditional.The earliest specific reference is in a United States newspaper in 1891, which may indicate a connection with carpetbaggers or to gluttony. The earliest specific Australian reference is a printed recipe from between 1899 and 1907.Carpet Bag a la Colchester, Jean Rutledge, Goulburn Cookery Book, various editions Food Timeline Another recipe from 1909 includes cayenne pepper as an ingredient, which may indicate an American origin.The Truth about Carpetbag Steak The Old Foodie  The more recent Australian versions typically use Worcestershire sauce, as does the local version of Oysters Kilpatrick.
It is sometimes served standing up like a miniature mountain. Pockets in the meat are made by small cuts, into which oysters are stuffed and sutured with toothpicks. As the dish is broiled, the flavour of the fresh oysters permeates the steak and blends with the juice of the tender meat. A strip of bacon may be wrapped around the serving and surrounded by peeled and browned baby potato halves. In one style, the steak is marinated in a sauce of thyme, pepper, tarragon, lemon, sugar and tamarind and served with a glass of dessert wine.

[[Pirate radio]]
CATEGORIES: Pirate radio, Anti-corporate activism

Pirate radio is illegal or unregulated radio transmission for entertainment or political purposes. While pirate just refers to the illegal nature of the broadcasts, there have also been notable pirate offshore radio transmissions.
Pirate radio generally describes the unlicensed broadcast of FM radio, AM radio, or short wave signals over a wide range. In some cases radio stations are deemed legal where the signal is transmitted, but illegal where the signals are received—especially when the signals cross a national boundary. In other cases, a broadcast may be considered "pirate" due to the nature of its content, its transmission format (especially a failure to transmit a station identification according to regulations), or the transmit power (wattage) of the station, even if the transmission is not technically illegal (such as a web cast or an amateur radio transmission).  Pirate radio stations are sometimes called bootleg stations (a term especially associated with two-way radio), clandestine stations (associated with heavily politically motivated operations)  or free radio stations.

The Nine Network is one of five main free-to-air commercial networks in Australia.
The Nine Network is one of the two highest rating television networks in Australia, along with the Seven Network and ahead of Network Ten, ABC and SBS. Nine had historically been the highest rating television network since television's inception in Australia in 1956 for most years up to 2006, although Network Ten had dominated in 1985 and for a number of years in the 1970s. The Nine Network's was overtaken in the ratings in 2007 by its rival, the Seven Network, which has dominated until recently. As a result, Nine's slogan "Still the One" was discontinued.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Unverified claim sentence|date=June 2012[/tpl] Since 2009, the network's slogan has been "Welcome Home".

[[National treatment]]

CATEGORIES: International law, World Trade Organization, Foreign direct investment

National treatment is a principle in international law vital to many treaty regimes.  It essentially means treating foreigners and locals equally.  Under national treatment, if a state grants a particular right, benefit or privilege to its own citizens, it must also grant those advantages to the citizens of other states while they are in that country.  In the context of international agreements, a state must provide equal treatment to those citizens of other states that are participating in the agreement.  Imported and locally-produced goods should be treated equally — at least after the foreign goods have entered the market.WTO: Understanding the WTO http://www.wto.org/english/theWTO_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm  
While this is generally viewed as a desirable principle, in custom it conversely means that a state can deprive foreigners of anything of which it deprives its own citizens.  An opposing principle calls for an international minimum standard of justice (a sort of basic due process) that would provide a base floor for the protection of rights and of access to judicial process.  The conflict between national treatment and minimum standards has mainly played out between industrialized and developing nations, in the context of expropriations.  Many developing nations, having the power to take control over the property of their own citizens, wished to exercise it over the property of aliens as well.
Though support for national treatment was expressed in several controversial (and legally non-binding) United Nations General Assembly resolutions, the issue of expropriations is almost universally handled through treaties with other states and contracts with private entities, rather than through reliance upon international custom.
National treatment only applies once a product, service or item of intellectual property has entered the market. Therefore, charging customs duty on an import is not a violation of national treatment even if locally-produced products are not charged an equivalent tax.

German philosophy, here taken to mean either (1) philosophy in the German language or (2) philosophy by Germans, has been extremely diverse, and central to both the analytic and continental traditions in philosophy for centuries, from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz through Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger and Ludwig Wittgenstein to contemporary philosophers. Søren Kierkegaard (a Danish philosopher) is frequently included in surveys of German (or Germanic) philosophy due to his extensive engagement with German thinkers.Lowith, Karl.

[[Angle of view]]

CATEGORIES: Science of photography, Optics, Angle

In photography, angle of view describes the angular extent of a given scene that is imaged by a camera. It is used interchangeably with the more general term field of view.
It is important to distinguish the angle of view from the angle of coverage, which describes the angle range that a lens can image. Typically the image circle produced by a lens is large enough to cover the film or sensor completely, possibly including some vignetting toward the edge. If the angle of coverage of the lens does not fill the sensor, the image circle will be visible, typically with strong vignetting toward the edge, and the effective angle of view will be limited to the angle of coverage.

[[German Romanticism]]

CATEGORIES: German idealism, German philosophy, German romantic painters, Romanticism, 19th-century German literature

In the philosophy, art, and culture of German-speaking countries, German Romanticism was the dominant  movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. German Romanticism developed relatively late compared to its English counterpart, coinciding in its early years with the movement known as German Classicism or Weimar Classicism.  In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety is notable for valuing humor and wit as well as beauty.
The early German romantics tried to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, looking to the Middle Ages as a simpler, more integrated period.  As time went on, however, they became increasingly aware of the tenuousness of the unity they were seeking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-232415/German-literature |title=German literature - Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl]  Later German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the everyday world and the seemingly irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius.  Heinrich Heine in particular criticized the tendency of the early romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society.

Esneux is constituted of a series of villages : Esneux, Mery Hony and Tilff. They are all to be found in the valley of the Ourthe river south of Liège. A railway line links the 4 villages (and then continues further south to Luxembourg).
Esneux and Tilff have seem to interests tourists, mainly for the local restaurants, the Esneux and Tilff castle, the bee-museum, and several parks. Most of these only have a local interest.
Tilff has a traffic problem, as the highway exit links to a round-about with a lot of traffic coming from both the south (Esneux) and the west (Boncelles, Angleur, ...). The local socialist parti (PS) wanted to solve this problem by a new stretch of road and a new bridge over the Ourthe river. Many inhabitants however feared that this project is of too large a scale and that the local atmosphere might change. The village now has fierce defenders of the 'new bridge', and an equally determined action committee against the plans. This last group wants the present bridge over the Ourthe river to be replaced, but without any new large scale infrastructure. These controversies might have a led to a change of coalition after the 2006 municipal elections : the PS lost some votes, the Christian democrats gained some and the liberals and the green party Ecolo where stable.
In Esneux the largest giant sequoia of Belgium can be found.Giant sequoia on the domaine du Rond Chêne

The Orient Express was the name of a long-distance passenger train service originally operated by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. It ran from 1883 to 2009 and is not to be confused with the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express luxury train service, which continues to run.
The route and rolling stock of the Orient Express changed many times. Several routes in the past concurrently used the Orient Express name, or slight variants thereof. Although the original Orient Express was simply a normal international railway service, the name has become synonymous with intrigue and luxury travel. The two city names most prominently associated with the Orient Express are Paris and Istanbul, the original endpoints of the timetabled service.[ref]

In 1977, the Orient Express stopped serving Istanbul. Its immediate successor, a through overnight service from Paris to Vienna, ran for the last time from Paris on Friday, June 8, 2007.[tpl]cite news | first = Simon | last = Calder | title = Murder of the Orient Express - End of the line for celebrated train service | date = 22 August 2009 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/murder-of-the-orient-express-1775809.html | work = The Independent | accessdate = 2013-03-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.agathachristie.com/insight/christie-papers/2011/05/17/history-orient-express/ | title = A History of the Orient Express | accessdate = 2013-03-13 | date = 17 May 2011 | publisher = Agatha Christie Limited[/tpl] After this, the route, still called the "Orient Express", was shortened to start from Strasbourg instead,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hiddeneurope.co.uk/barticle_info.php?articles_id=366 |title='hidden europe' magazine e-news Issue 2007/15 |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2007-06-07[/tpl] occasioned by the inauguration of the LGV Est which affords much shorter travel times from Paris to Strasbourg. The new curtailed service left Strasbourg at 22.20 daily, shortly after the arrival of a TGV from Paris, and was attached at Karlsruhe to the overnight sleeper service from Amsterdam to Vienna.

[[Nord Express]]

CATEGORIES: International named passenger trains, Railway services introduced in 1896, Night trains

The Nord Express (Northern Express) was a train service introduced in 1896 by Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, a Belgian night train company. It left Paris and travelled via Brussels, Cologne, Hanover, Berlin, Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad) and Dünaburg to Saint Petersburg.
The founders of CIWL wanted to establish a direct link between Saint Petersburg and Lisbon to connect with ocean liners to America. 
Passengers from Russia had to change once in East Prussia at the German/Russian border because Russian railway tracks are of a wider gauge than those in Western Europe. In Paris there was a connecting service to the Sud Express (Southern Express) to Lisbon. This train service enabled people to travel across Europe in what was, by the standards of the time, a very fast and comfortable manner.
After World War I the train was diverted to Warsaw instead to Saint Petersburg. After World War II the "iron curtain" and air travel caused the end to this famous train.
Since World War II the name Nord Express has been used for the ordinary night train between Paris and Copenhagen. In 2007 it was shortened further and diverted again such that it now runs between Paris and Hamburg, taking 10.5 hours.

[[Limbourg]]

CATEGORIES: Municipalities of Liège (province)

LimbourgOccasionally formerly "Lambourg", as in the 1584 Treaty of Joinville. (German and Dutch: Limburg) is a town located in the province of Liège, Wallonia, Belgium. 
On 1 January 2008 Limbourg had a total population of 5,680. The total area is 24.63 km² which gives a population density of 231 inhabitants per km². The present municipality Limbourg was formed in 1977 by the merger of the old municipalities Limbourg, Bilstain and Goé. 
The second part of the name Limbourg is from burg meaning a "fortress", which is common in many parts of Europe where Germanic languages are spoken or have been spoken historically (see Germanic placename etymology). Concerning the first part of the name there are various theories. One is lint meaning "dragon".Berkel and Samplonius, "Het Plaatsnamenboek", 1989, Unieboek, Houten 
Limbourg is located on top of a hill which in its turn is surrounded by the river Vesdre. This was a strong military advantage in the Middle Ages and allowed the city to defend itself against foreign invaders. In the Middle Ages, the ruling family came to have the rank of duke and so the town was the seat of the Duchy of Limburg, which was a part of the Lower Lorraine region of the Holy Roman Empire.
The town featured in the War of the Spanish Succession, falling in 1703 to British and Dutch Republican forces led by the Duke of Marlborough. The lower part of the town, along the Vesdre, is called Dolhain.

[[Polymer physics]]

CATEGORIES: Polymer physics, Statistical mechanics

Polymer physics is the field of physics that studies polymers, their fluctuations, mechanical properties, as well as the kinetics of reactions involving degradation and polymerisation of polymers and monomers respectively.P. Flory, Principles of Polymer Chemistry, Cornell University Press, 1953. ISBN 0-8014-0134-8.Pierre Gilles De Gennes, Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics CORNELL UNIVERSITY PRESS Ithaca and London, 1979M. Doi and S. F. Edwards, The Theory of Polymer Dynamics Oxford University Inc NY, 1986Michael Rubinstein and Ralph H. Colby, Polymer Physics Oxford University Press, 2003
While it focuses on the perspective of condensed matter physics, polymer physics is originally a branch of statistical physics. Polymer physics and polymer chemistry are also related with the field of polymer science, where this is considered the applicative part of polymers.
Polymers are large molecules and thus are very complicated for solving using a deterministic method. Yet, statistical approaches can yield results and are often pertinent, since large polymers (i.e., polymers with a large number of monomers) are describable efficiently in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many monomers (although the actual size is clearly finite).
Thermal fluctuations continuously affect the shape of polymers in liquid solutions, and modeling their effect requires using  principles from statistical mechanics and dynamics. As a corollary, temperature strongly affects the physical behavior of polymers in solution, causing phase transitions, melts, and so on.
The statistical approach for polymer physics is based on an analogy between a polymer and either a Brownian motion, or other type of a random walk, the self-avoiding walk. The simplest possible polymer model is presented by the ideal chain, corresponding to a simple random walk. Experimental approaches for characterizing polymers are also common, using Polymer characterization methods, such as size exclusion chromatography, Viscometry, Dynamic light scattering, and Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP)US patent 6052184 and US Patent 6653150, other patents pendingF.

Reed, “Absolute, Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions”, Macromolecules 1998, 31(21), 7226-7238 for determining the chemical, physical, and material properties of polymers.

[[SEPECAT Jaguar]]

The SEPECAT Jaguar is an Anglo-French jet ground attack aircraft, originally used by the British Royal Air Force and the French Armée de l'Air in the close air support and nuclear strike role, and still in service with several export customers, notably the Indian Air Force and the Royal Air Force of Oman.
Originally conceived in the 1960s as jet trainer with a light ground attack capability, the requirement for the aircraft soon changed to include  supersonic performance, reconnaissance and tactical nuclear strike roles. A carrier-based variant was also planned for French service, but this was cancelled in favour of the cheaper Dassault Super Étendard. The airframes were manufactured by SEPECAT (Société Européenne de Production de l'avion Ecole de Combat et d'Appui Tactique), a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation, one of the first major joint-Anglo-French military aircraft programs.
The Jaguar was exported to India, Oman, Ecuador and Nigeria. With various air forces, the Jaguar was used in numerous conflicts and military operations in Mauritania, Chad, Iraq, Bosnia, and Pakistan, as well as providing a ready nuclear delivery platform for Britain, France, and India throughout the latter half of the Cold War and beyond. In the Gulf War, the Jaguar was praised for its reliability and was a valuable coalition resource. The aircraft served with the Armée de l'Air as the main strike/attack aircraft until 1 July 2005, and with the Royal Air Force until the end of April 2007. It was replaced by the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon in the RAF and the Dassault Rafale in the Armée de l'Air. India plans in the long term to replace its Jaguar fleet with the developing Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA).

Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet (16 February 1791 – 14 June 1868) was a French physicist and a professor of physics at the Sorbonne and member of the French Academy of Science. Succeeding Dulong, he became the fourth holder of the chair of physics at Polytechnique for a brief period of time (1830-1831) but chose to resign, citing health reasons. He was succeeded by César Despretz in 1831 and Gabriel Lamé in 1832.
The Pouillet effect was named after the phenomenon that he published in 1822 on the heat produced by the wetting of dry sand.
He developed a pyrheliometer and made, between 1837 and 1838, the first quantitative measurements of solar constant. His estimate was 1228 W/m2, very close to the current estimate of 1367 W/m2. Using the wrong Dulong-Petit law he estimated the temperature of the Sun's surface to be around 1800 °C. This value was corrected in 1879 to 5430 °C by Jožef Stefan (1835–1893).
Pouillet works include:
Svante Arrhenius (1896) cited a great deal of Pouillet's work.

CATEGORIES: White wine grape varieties

Riesling is a white grape variety which originated in the Rhine region of Germany. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet and sparkling white wines. Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. As of 2004, Riesling was estimated to be the world's 20th most grown variety at [tpl]convert|48700|ha|acre[/tpl] (with an increasing trend),J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition, Oxford University Press 2006, pg. 746: "Vine varieties", ISBN 0-19-860990-6 but in terms of importance for quality wines, it is usually included in the "top three" white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Riesling is a variety which is highly "terroir-expressive", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is clearly influenced by the wine's place of origin.
In cool climates, (such as many German wine regions) Riesling wines tend to exhibit apple and tree fruit notes with noticeable levels of acidity that is sometimes balanced with residual sugar. A late-ripening variety that can develop more citrus and peach notes in warmer climates (such as Alsace, parts of Austria). In Australia, Riesling is often noted for a characteristic lime note that tends to emerge in examples from the Clare and Eden Valley in South Australia. Riesling's naturally high acidity and pronounced fruit flavors gives wines made from the grape immense aging potential with well-made examples from favorable vintages often developing smokey, honey notes and aged German Rieslings, in particular, taking on a "petrol" character.Wine & Spirits Education Trust "Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality" pgs 6-9, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, ISBN 9781905819157

Specifically, the geoid is the equipotential surface that would coincide with the mean ocean surface of the Earth if the oceans and atmosphere were in equilibrium, at rest relative to the rotating Earth,http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/FACULTY/conrad/classes/GG612_S11/Lecture_03.pdf and extended through the continents (such as with very narrow canals). According to Gauss, who first described it, it is the "mathematical figure of the Earth", a smooth but highly irregular surface that corresponds not to the actual surface of the Earth's crust, but to a surface which can only be known through extensive gravitational measurements and calculations. Despite being an important concept for almost two hundred years in the history of geodesy and geophysics, it has only been defined to high precision in recent decades, for instance by works of Petr Vaníček, and others. It is often described as the true physical figure of the Earth, in contrast to the idealized geometrical figure of a reference ellipsoid.
The surface of the geoid is higher than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a positive gravity anomaly (mass excess) and lower than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a negative gravity anomaly (mass deficit).[tpl]cite book|last=Fowler|first=C.M.R.|title=The Solid Earth; An Introduction to Global Geophysics|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9780521584098|page=214[/tpl] The differences in gravity, and hence the scalar potential field, arise from the uneven distribution of mass in the Earth.

Algherese (Standard Catalan: Alguerès, [tpl]IPA-ca|əɫɣəˈɾɛs|IPA[/tpl]; Algherese: Alguerés, [tpl]IPA-ca|alɣaˈɾes|IPA[/tpl]) is the variant of the Catalan language spoken in the city of Alghero (L'Alguer in Catalan), in the northwest of Sardinia, Italy.
Catalan invaders repopulated the town and expelled the indigenous mixed population (Sardinian, Ligurian, Corsican and Tuscan) in 1372, after several revolts.L'Alguer and Alguerese Catalan - Oral Corpus of Alguerese 
Catalan was replaced as the official language by Spanish, then by Italian in mid 18th century, but its use remained widespread until at least the 1960s. Today it has semi-official status alongside Italian.Alghero official website

[[Gender marking in job titles]]

CATEGORIES: Gender-neutral language

One of the chief issues with which the movement for gender-neutral language has been concerned is that of gender (sex) specificity in job titles. 
A gender-specific job title is a name of a job that also specifies or implies the gender of the person performing that job. For example, in English, the job title stewardess implies that the person is female; the job title policeman implies that the person is male. A gender-neutral job title, on the other hand, is one that does not specify or imply gender, such as firefighter or lawyer. In some cases it may be debatable whether a title is gender-specific; for example, chairman appears to denote a male (because of the ending -man), but the title is also applied sometimes to women.
Proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the use of gender-neutral job titles, particularly in contexts where the gender of the person in question is not known or not specified. For example, they prefer flight attendant to stewardess or steward, and police officer to policeman or policewoman. In some cases this may involve deprecating the use of certain specifically female titles (such as authoress), thus encouraging the use of the corresponding unmarked form (such as author) as a fully gender-neutral title.
The above applies to gender neutrality in English and in some other languages without grammatical gender (where grammatical gender is a feature of a language's grammar that requires every noun to be placed in one of several classes, often including feminine and masculine). In languages with grammatical gender, the situation is altered by the fact that nouns for people are often constrained to be inherently masculine or feminine, and the production of truly gender-neutral titles may not be possible. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language may instead focus on ensuring that feminine and masculine words exist for every job, and that they are treated with equal status.

The Battle of Atlanta was a battle of the Atlanta Campaign fought during the American Civil War on July 22, 1864, just southeast of Atlanta, Georgia.[tpl]sfn|Cozzes|2002|p=546[/tpl] Continuing their summer campaign to seize the important rail and supply center of Atlanta, Union forces commanded by William T. Sherman overwhelmed and defeated Confederate forces defending the city under John B. Hood.  Union Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson was killed during the battle. Despite the implication of finality in its name, the battle occurred midway through the campaign and the city did not fall until September 2, 1864, after a Union siege and various attempts to seize railroads and supply lines leading to Atlanta. After taking the city, Sherman's troops headed south-southeastward toward Milledgeville, the State capital, and on to Savannah with the March to the Sea.
The fall of Atlanta was especially noteworthy for its political ramifications. In the 1864 election, former Union General George B. McClellan, a Democrat, ran against President Lincoln on a peace platform calling for truce with the Confederacy.  The capture of Atlanta and Hood's burning of military facilities as he evacuated were extensively covered by Northern newspapers, significantly boosting Northern morale, and Lincoln was reelected by a large margin.

The Solemn League and Covenant was an agreement between the Scottish Covenanters and the leaders of the English Parliamentarians. It was agreed to in 1643, during the First English Civil War.
The Protestant leaders of the embattled English parliament, faced with the threat of Irish Catholic troops joining with the Royalist army, requested the aid of the Scots. The Presbyterian Covenanters promised their aid against the 'papists', on condition that the Scottish system of church government was adopted in England. This was acceptable to the majority of the English Long Parliament, as many of them were presbyterians, while others preferred allying with the Scots to losing the Civil War.
After some haggling a document called "The Solemn League and Covenant"Text of The Solemn League and Covenant for reformation and defence of religion... was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between the English Parliament and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and Ireland "according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches", and the extirpation of popery and prelacy. It did not explicitly mention presbyterianism, and included some ambiguous formulations which left the door open to the English Independents, another strong faction on the English Parliamentary side, particularly in the parliamentary armies. It was subscribed to by many in England, Scotland, and Ireland, approved by the English Long Parliament, and, with some slight modifications, by the Westminster Assembly of Divines. This agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the First English Civil War. Not all those on the parliamentarian side were happy with this arrangement and some, like John Lilburne, chose to leave the parliamentary armies rather than take the oath prescribed in the Act enforcing the Solemn League and Covenant.
After the Royalists had lost the First Civil War, Charles I was able to enter into an "Engagement" with the majority of the Covenanters in which they agreed to support him in the Second English Civil War against their mutual enemy the English Independents, in return for Charles imposing presbyterianism for three years on England. In 1648 the Royalists and the Covenanters were defeated at the Battle of Preston, and Charles was executed in January 1649. The Scottish Covenants persuaded the exiled Charles II of England to agree to the terms of the Solemn League and Covenant in the Treaty of Breda (1650). However the defeat of the Royalist and Scottish army at the Battle of Worcester in 1651 ended the relevance of the Solemn League and Covenant as the power of the Presbyterians was broken on both sides of the border.
After the Restoration the English Parliament passed the Sedition Act 1661, which declared that the Solemn League and Covenant was unlawful, was to be abjured by all persons holding public offices, and was to be burnt by the common hangman.

The White Mountains are a mountain range covering about a quarter of the state of New Hampshire and a small portion of western Maine in the United States.  Part of the northern Appalachian Mountains, they are the most rugged mountains in New England. The range is heavily visited due to its proximity to Boston and, to a lesser extent, New York City.
Most of the area is public land, including the White Mountain National Forest and a number of state parks. Its most famous mountain is [tpl]convert|6288|ft|adj=on[/tpl] Mount Washington, which is the highest peak in the Northeastern U.S. and which held the record for fastest surface wind gust ([tpl]convert|231|mph[/tpl], over 100 m/s, in 1934) in the world for 76 years. It lies in a line of summits called the Presidential Range named after U.S. presidents and other prominent Americans.
The White Mountains also include the Franconia Range, Sandwich Range, Carter-Moriah Range and Kinsman Range in New Hampshire, and the Mahoosuc Range straddling the border between it and Maine. In all, there are 48 peaks over [tpl]convert|4000|ft[/tpl], known as the Four-thousand footers.
The Whites are known for a system of alpine huts for hikers operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club. The Appalachian Trail crosses the area from southwest to northeast.

The Mayflower Compact was the first governing document of  Plymouth Colony. It was written by the Separatists, sometimes referred to as the "Saints", fleeing from religious persecution by King James of England. They traveled aboard the Mayflower in 1620 along with adventurers, tradesmen, and servants, most of whom were referred to, by the Separatists as "Strangers".
The Mayflower Compact was signed aboard ship on November 11, 1620 by most adult men.  The Pilgrims used the Julian Calendar, also known as Old Style dates, which, at that time, was ten days behind the Gregorian Calendar.  Signing the covenant were 41 of the ship's 101 passengers, while the Mayflower was anchored in what is now Provincetown Harbor within the hook at the northern tip of Cape Cod.

[[Enantiomer]]

CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry, Isomerism

In chemistry, an enantiomer ([tpl]IPAc-en|ɨ|ˈ|n|æ|n|t|ɪ|.|ɵ|m|ər[/tpl] [tpl]respell|ə|NAN|tee-ə-mər[/tpl]; from the Greek ἐνάντιος, opposite, and μέρος, part or portion) is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are  non-superposable  (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for opposite orientation.[tpl]GoldBookRef | title = enantiomer | file = E02069[/tpl]
Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (enantio = opposite ; morph = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.
Enantiopure compounds refer to samples having, within the limits of detection, molecules of only one chirality.[tpl]GoldBookRef | title = enantiomerically pure (enantiopure) | file = E02072[/tpl]
Enantiomers have, when present in a symmetric environment, identical chemical and physical properties except for their ability to rotate plane-polarized light (+/−) by equal amounts but in opposite directions (although the polarized light can be considered an asymmetric medium). A mixture of equal parts of an optically active isomer and its enantiomer is termed racemic and has zero net rotation of plane-polarized light because the positive rotation of each (+) form is exactly counteracted by the negative rotation of a (−) one.
Enantiomers of each other often show different chemical reactions with other substances that are also enantiomers. Since many molecules in the bodies of living beings are enantiomers themselves, there is sometimes a marked difference in the effects of two enantiomers on living beings. In drugs, for example, often only one of a drug's enantiomers is responsible for the desired physiologic effects, while the other enantiomer is less active, inactive, or sometimes even responsible for adverse effects.  
Owing to this discovery, drugs composed of only one enantiomer ("enantiopure") can be developed to enhance the pharmacological efficacy and sometimes do away with some side effects.  An example of this kind of drug is eszopiclone (Lunesta), which is enantiopure and therefore is given in doses that are exactly 1/2 of the older, racemic mixture called zopiclone.  In the case of eszopiclone, the S enantiomer is responsible for all the desired effects, though the other enantiomer seems to be inactive; while an individual must take 2 mg of zopiclone to get the same therapeutic benefit as they would receive from 1 mg of eszopiclone, that appears to be the only difference between the two drugs.

West Norwood is a largely residential area of South London within the London Borough of Lambeth. It borders the London Boroughs of Croydon and Southwark. It is located is 5.4 miles (8.7 km) south south-east of Charing Cross.
The centre of West Norwood sits in a bowl surrounded by hillsides on its east, west and south sides.  From many places in the area, distant views can be seen, including glimpses of the City, Canary Wharf, Crystal Palace, Dulwich and the ridge at Leigham Court Road.
The main shopping area is in Norwood Road which is characterised by the high percentage of independent shops with a modest number of major retailers.  A new facility, Norwood Hall, is due to open in 2014.  It will offer leisure facilities including swimming, gym, dance studio and community space as well as health resources, both GP and dental.
At the focus of the shopping parades on Norwood Road and Knights Hill is St Luke’s church and gardens.  Consecrated in 1825, St Luke's is one of the so-called "Waterloo" churches.  To its eastern side is West Norwood Cemetery, one of the “Magnificent Seven” which has the greatest number of Listed cemetery monuments of any in England, attracting many visitors.
The area is well served by public transport with London National Rail stations at each end of the main shopping area: West Norwood and Tulse Hill from which there are frequent services to Victoria and London Bridge, as well as surrounding locations.  There are eight daytime bus routes and two nighttime.  The South Circular A205 passes close-by at Tulse Hill with A23 Streatham High Road to the west.
West Norwood includes some or all of three Wards of the London Borough of Lambeth - Gipsy Hill, Knights Hill and Thurlow Park.

[[Evoked potential]]

An evoked potential or evoked response is an electrical potential recorded from the nervous system of a human or other animal following presentation of a stimulus, as distinct from spontaneous potentials as detected by electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or other electrophysiological recording method.
Evoked potential amplitudes tend to be low, ranging from less than a microvolt to several microvolts, compared to tens of microvolts for EEG, millivolts for EMG, and often close to a volt for ECG. To resolve these low-amplitude potentials against the background of ongoing EEG, ECG, EMG, and other biological signals and ambient noise, signal averaging is usually required. The signal is time-locked to the stimulus and most of the noise occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out with averaging of repeated responses.[tpl]Cite book|title=Spehlmann's Evoked Potential Primer |author= Karl E. Misulis, Toufic Fakhoury|year= 2001|publisher=Butterworth-heinemann|isbn=0-7506-7333-8[/tpl]
Signals can be recorded from cerebral cortex, brain stem, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Usually the term "evoked potential" is reserved for responses involving either recording from, or stimulation of, central nervous system structures. Thus evoked compound motor action potentials (CMAP) or sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) as used in nerve conduction studies (NCS) are generally not thought of as evoked potentials, though they do meet the above definition.

The Central African Empire (French: Empire centrafricain) was a short-lived, self-declared constitutional monarchy but in reality an absolutist autocratic monarchy that replaced the Central African Republic and was, in turn, replaced by the restoration of the Republic. The empire was formed when Jean-Bédel Bokassa, president of the Republic, declared himself Emperor Bokassa I on 4 December 1976. 
Bokassa spent the equivalent of over 20 million United States dollars, a quarter of the country’s government annual income, on his coronation ceremony. The monarchy was abolished and the name “Central African Republic” was restored on 21 September 1979, when Bokassa was ousted with French support.

[[Virtual community]]

CATEGORIES: Virtual reality, Community building, Social information processing, Community websites, Social software, Sociology index

A virtual community is a social network of individuals who interact through specific social media, potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. One of the most pervasive types of virtual community operate under social networking services consisting of various online communities.
The term virtual community is attributed to the book of the same title by Howard Rheingold. The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on The WELL, computer-mediated communication and social groups and information science. Technologies cited include Usenet, MUDs (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives MUSHes and MOOs, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), chat rooms and electronic mailing lists. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community.
Virtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. Some virtual communities do both. Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: message boards, chat rooms, social networking sites, or virtual worlds.Hof, R. D., Browder, S., Elstrom, P.

CATEGORIES: 1539 books, Early printed Bibles, History of Christianity in the United Kingdom, History of the Church of England, Tudor England, 16th-century Christian texts, Bible translations into English

The Great Bible was the first authorized edition of the Bible in English, authorized by King Henry VIII of England to be read aloud in the church services of the Church of England. The Great Bible was prepared by Myles Coverdale, working under commission of Thomas, Lord Cromwell, Secretary to Henry VIII and Vicar General. In 1538, Cromwell directed the clergy to provide "one book of the bible of the largest volume in English, and the same set up in some convenient place within the said church that ye have care of, whereas your parishioners may most commodiously resort to the same and read it."
The Great Bible includes much from the Tyndale Bible, with the objectionable features revised. As the Tyndale Bible was incomplete, Coverdale translated the remaining books of the Old Testament and Apocrypha from the Latin Vulgate and German translations, rather than working from the original Greek,  Hebrew and Aramaic  texts. Although called the Great Bible because of its large size, it is known by several other names as well: the Cromwell Bible, since Thomas Cromwell directed its publication; Whitchurch's Bible after its first English printer; the Chained Bible, since it was chained to prevent removal from the church. It has also been termed less accurately Cranmer's Bible, since Thomas Cranmer was not responsible for the translation, and his preface first appeared in the second edition.[tpl]Citation | first = Alfred W | last = Pollard | contribution = Biographical Introduction | title = The Holy Bible | edition = 1611, King James Version | place = Peabody, MA | publisher = Hendrickson | year = 2003 | ISBN = 1-56563-160-9[/tpl].

Uxmal (Yucatec Maya: Óoxmáal [tpl]IPA-myn|óˑʃmáˑl|[/tpl]) is an ancient Maya city of the classical period in present-day Mexico. It is considered one of the most important archaeological sites of Maya culture, along with Chichen Itza in Mexico; Caracol and  Xunantunich in Belize, and Tikal in Guatemala. It is located in the Puuc region and is considered one of the Maya cities most representative of the region's dominant architectural style. It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in recognition of its significance.
It is located 62 km south of Mérida, capital of Yucatán state in Mexico. Its buildings are noted for their size and decoration. Ancient roads called sacbes connect the buildings, and also were built to other cities in the area such as Chichén Itzá, Caracol and Xunantunich in modern-day Belize, and Tikal in modern-day Guatemala.
Its buildings are typical of the Puuc style, with smooth low walls that open on ornate friezes based on representations of typical Maya huts. These are represented by columns (representing the reeds used for the walls of the huts) and trapezoidal shapes (representing the thatched roofs). Entwined snakes and, in many cases two-headed snakes are used for masks of the rain god, Chaac; its big noses represent the rays of the storms. Feathered serpents with open fangs are shown leaving from the same human beings. Also seen in some cities are the influences of the Nahua, who followed the cult of Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc. These were integrated with the original elements of the Puuc tradition.
The buildings take advantage of the terrain to gain height and acquire important volumes, including the Pyramid of the Magician, with five levels, and the Governor's Palace, which covers an area of more than [tpl]convert|1200|m²|0|abbr=on[/tpl].

[[Normal lens]]

CATEGORIES: Photographic lenses

In photography and cinematography, a normal lens is a lens that reproduces a field of view that generally looks "natural" to a human observer under normal viewing conditions, as compared with lenses with longer or shorter focal lengths which produce an expanded or contracted field of view that distorts the perspective when viewed from a normal viewing distance.[ref]

</ref><ref name=stroebel>

</ref>
Lenses of shorter focal length are called wide-angle lenses, while longer-focal-length lenses are referred to as long-focus lensesBruce Warren, Photography, page 71 (with the most common of that type being the telephoto lenses).
For still photography, a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format is considered to be a normal lens; its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large-enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance equal to the print diagonal; this angle of view is about 53° diagonally. For cinematography, where the image is normally viewed at a greater distance, a lens with a focal length of roughly double the film or sensor diagonal is considered 'normal'.
The term normal lens can also be used as a synonym for rectilinear lens.  This is a completely different use of the term.

John Couch Adams FRS (5 June 1819 – 21 January 1892) was a British mathematician and astronomer. Adams was born in Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, and died in Cambridge.  The Cornish name Couch is pronounced "cooch".
His most famous achievement was predicting the existence and position of Neptune, using only mathematics. The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus's orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton. At the same time, but unknown to each other, the same calculations were made by Urbain Le Verrier. Le Verrier would assist Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle in locating the planet on 23 September 1846, which was found within 1° of its predicted location, a point in Aquarius. (There was, and to some extent still is, some controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery; see Discovery of Neptune.)
He was Lowndean Professor at the University of Cambridge for thirty-three years from 1859 to his death. He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866.  In 1884, he attended the International Meridian Conference as a delegate for Britain.
A crater on the Moon is jointly named after him, Walter Sydney Adams and Charles Hitchcock Adams. Neptune's outermost known ring and the asteroid 1996 Adams are also named after him. The Adams Prize, presented by the University of Cambridge, commemorates his prediction of the position of Neptune. His personal library is now in the care of Cambridge University Library.

[[Internet Storm Center]]

CATEGORIES: Computing websites, Internet security

The Internet Storm Center (ISC) is a program of the SANS Technology Institute, a branch of the SANS Institute which monitors the level of malicious activity on the Internet, particularly with regard to large-scale infrastructure events. 
The ISC evolved from "Incidents.org", a site initially founded by the SANS Institute to assist in the
public-private sector cooperation during the Y2K cutover. In 2000, Incidents.org started to cooperate with DShield to create a Consensus Incidents Database (CID). It collected security information from cooperating sites and agencies for mass analysis.  
On March 22, 2001, the SANS CID was responsible for the early detection of the "Lion" worm attacks on various facilities.  The quick warning and counter-efforts organized by the CID were instrumental in controlling the damage done by this worm, which otherwise might have been considerably worse.  
Later, DShield was integrated closer into incidents.org as the SANS Institute started to sponsor DShield. The CID was renamed the "Internet Storm Center" in acknowledgement of the way it uses the distributed sensor network similar to the way a weather reporting center will detect and track an atmospheric storm and provide warnings.  Since that time the ISC has expanded its monitoring operations; its website cites a figure of over twenty million "intrusion detection log entries" per day.  It continues to provide analyses and alerts of security threats to the Internet community.
During the last hours of 2005 and the first weeks of 2006, the Internet Storm Center went to its longest period at the time to "yellow" on the Infocon for the WMF vulnerability.
The most prominent feature of the ISC is a daily "Handler Diary" which is prepared by one of the 40 volunteer incident handlers and summarized the events of the day. It frequently is the first public source for new attack trends and actively facilitates cooperation by soliciting more information to understand particular attacks better.
The Internet Storm Center is currently staffed with approximately 40 volunteers, representing 8 countries and many industries.

A blue box is an electronic device that generates the same tones employed by a telephone operator's dialing console to switch long-distance calls.[tpl]cite book |title=The Hacker Crackdown |first=Bruce |last=Sterling |authorlink=Bruce Sterling |chapter=2 [/tpl] A blue box is a tool that emerged in the 1960s and '70s; it allowed users to route their own calls by emulating the in-band signaling mechanism that then controlled switching in long distance dialing systems. The most typical use of a blue box was to place free telephone calls. A related device, the black box enabled one to receive calls which were free to the caller. The blue box no longer works in most Western nations, as modern switching systems are now digital and do not use in-band signaling. Instead, signaling occurs on an out-of-band channel which cannot be accessed from the line the caller is using, a system called Common Channel Interoffice Signaling or CCIS.

Werther was an important novel of the Sturm und Drang period in German literature, and influenced the later Romantic literary movement. 
Finished in six weeks of intensive writing during January–March 1774, its publication instantly made the 24-year-old Goethe one of the first international literary celebrities. Of all his works, this book was the most known to the general public. Towards the end of Goethe's life, a personal visit to Weimar became crucial to any young man's tour of Europe.

[[Mount Monadnock]]

Mount Monadnock, or Grand Monadnock, is a mountain in the New England state of New Hampshire, known for its presence in the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. It is the most prominent mountain peak between the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Massachusetts Berkshires, and is the highest point in Cheshire County, New Hampshire. It has long been known as one of the most frequently climbed mountains in the world.NH Division of Parks & Recreation: Monadnock State Park
At [tpl]convert|3165|ft[/tpl], Mount Monadnock is nearly [tpl]convert|1000|ft[/tpl] higher than any other mountain peak within [tpl]convert|30|mi[/tpl] and rises [tpl]convert|2000|ft[/tpl] above the surrounding landscape. Mount Monadnock, [tpl]convert|62|mi[/tpl] northwest of Boston and [tpl]convert|38|mi[/tpl] southwest of Concord, is located within the towns of Jaffrey and Dublin, New Hampshire.
The term "monadnock" has come to be used by American geologists to describe any isolated mountain formed from the exposure of a harder rock as a result of the erosion of a softer rock that once surrounded it (a landform termed inselberg elsewhere in the world).
Monadnock's bare, isolated, and rocky summit provides expansive views. A number of hiking trails ascend the mountain, including the [tpl]convert|110|mi|adj=on[/tpl] Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and the [tpl]convert|50|mi|adj=on[/tpl] Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway.DeLorme Topo USA 6.0. (2006). Mapping software. Yarmouth, Maine:DeLorme.
It remains clear largely because of fires set by early settlers. The first major fire, set in 1800 to clear the lower slopes for pasture, swept through the stands of virgin red spruce on the summit and flanks of the mountain. Further fires and hurricane damage[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl] left the forests a tangle of fallen timber. Between 1810 and 1820, local farmers, who believed that wolves were denning in the blowdowns, set fire to the mountain again. The conflagration raged for weeks, destroying the topsoil and denuding the mountain above [tpl]convert|2000|ft[/tpl].

[[Zeeman effect]]

CATEGORIES: Spectroscopy, Quantum magnetism, Foundational quantum physics

The Zeeman effect ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|z|eɪ|m|ən[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-nl|ˈzeːmɑn|IPA[/tpl]), named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, is the effect of  splitting a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. It is analogous to the Stark effect, the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field. Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the dipole approximation), as governed by the selection rules.
Since the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of the magnetic field, this effect can be used to measure the magnetic field, e.g. that of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas.
The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Mössbauer spectroscopy. It may also be utilized to improve accuracy in atomic absorption spectroscopy.
A theory about the magnetic sense of birds assumes that a protein in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect.The magnetic compass mechanisms of birds and rodents are based on different physical principles. Journal of the Royal Society
When the spectral lines are absorption lines, the effect is called inverse Zeeman effect.

Underwood Dudley (born January 6, 1937) is a mathematician, formerly of DePauw University, who has written a number of research works and textbooks but is best known for his popular writing. Most notable are several books describing crank mathematics by people who think they have squared the circle or done other impossible things. That sort of work is thrown away by most professionals, but Dudley has saved and analyzed it, calling it the folklore of mathematics.
He is the discoverer of the Dudley Triangle.
These books, which alternate between appreciation and exasperation, include The Trisectors (MAA 1996, ISBN 0-88385-514-3), Mathematical Cranks (MAA 1992, ISBN 0-88385-507-0), and Numerology: Or, What Pythagoras Wrought (MAA 1997, ISBN 0-88385-524-0). They helped him win the Trevor Evans Award for expository writing from the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in 1996. Dudley has also written and edited straightforward mathematical works such as Readings for Calculus (MAA 1993, ISBN 0-88385-087-7) and Elementary Number Theory (W.H. Freeman 1978, ISBN 0-7167-0076-X).
Dudley is a native of New York City.  He received bachelor's and master's degrees from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.  His academic career consisted of two years at Ohio State University followed by thirty-seven at DePauw University, from which he retired in 2004.  He has edited the College Mathematics Journal and the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal, and was a Polya Lecturer for the MAA for two years.

They are made from a metal alloy with a more "active" voltage (more negative electrochemical potential) than the metal of the structure. The difference in potential between the two metals means that the galvanic anode corrodes, so that the anode material is consumed in preference to the structure.
The loss (or sacrifice) of the anode material gives rise to the alternative name of sacrificial anode.

Jean-Baptiste Sylvère Gay, vicomte de Martignac (20 June 1778 – 3 April 1832) was a moderate royalist French statesman during the Bourbon Restoration 1814–30 under King Charles X.
Martignac was born in Bordeaux, France. In 1798 he became secretary to Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès; after serving for a while in the army, he turned to literature, producing several light plays. Under the Empire he practised with success as an advocate at Bordeaux, where in 1818 he became advocate-general of the cour royale. In 1819 he was appointed procureur-général at Limoges, and in 1821 was returned for Marmande to the Chamber of Deputies, where he supported the ultraroyalist policies of Villèle. In 1822 he was appointed councillor of state, in 1823 he accompanied the duc d'Angouléme to Spain as civil commissary; in 1824 he was created a viscount and appointed director-general of registration.
In contact with practical politics his ultra-royalist views were gradually modified in the direction of the Doctrinaires, and on the fall of Villèle he was selected by Charles X to carry out the new policy of compromise. On 4 January 1828 he was appointed minister of the interior, and, though not bearing the title of president, became the virtual head of the cabinet. He succeeded in passing the act abolishing the press censorship, and in persuading the king to sign the ordinances of 16 June 1828 on the Jesuits and the little seminaries.
He was exposed to attack from both the extreme left and the extreme right, and when in April 1829 a coalition of these groups defeated him in the chamber, Charles X, who had never believed in the policy he represented, replaced him by the prince de Polignac. In March 1830 Martignac voted with the majority for the address protesting against the famous ordinances; but during the revolution that followed he remained true to his legitimist principles. His last public appearance was in defence of Polignac in the Chamber of Peers in December 1830.

[[Neutral theory of molecular evolution]]

CATEGORIES: Population genetics, Molecular evolution

The neutral theory of molecular evolution holds that at the molecular level most evolutionary changes and most of the variation within and between species is not caused by natural selection but by random drift of mutant alleles that are neutral. A neutral mutation is one that does not affect an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. The neutral theory allows for the possibility that most mutations are deleterious, but holds that because these are rapidly purged by natural selection, they do not make significant contributions to variation within and between species at the molecular level. Mutations that are not deleterious are assumed to be mostly neutral rather than beneficial. In addition to assuming the primacy of neutral mutations, the theory also assumes that the fate of neutral mutations is determined by the sampling processes described by specific models of random genetic drift.Kimura, Motoo. (1983). The neutral theory of molecular evolution. Cambridge 
According to Kimura, the theory applies only for evolution at the molecular level, and phenotypic evolution is controlled by natural selection, as postulated by Charles Darwin. The proposal of the neutral theory was followed by an extensive "neutralist-selectionist" controversy over the interpretation of patterns of molecular divergence and polymorphism, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s. The controversy is still unsettled among evolutionary biologists.

[[ORWO]]
CATEGORIES: Photographic film makers, Volkseigene Betriebe, Photography companies of Germany, Defunct photography companies

ORWO was an East German manufacturer of photographic film and magnetic tape. The basis for ORWO was the Agfa Wolfen plant, where the first modern colour film, with incorporated colour couplers, Agfacolor, was developed in 1936.
On 20 April 1945, following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the plant was taken over by US forces and important patents and other documents regarding the Agfacolor process were confiscated and handed over to Western competitors, such as Kodak and Ilford. As the plant was located in what was to become the Soviet zone of occupied Germany, the US forces then handed it over to the Soviet military administration, which dismantled large parts of the plant and moved it, with key German staff, to the Soviet Union, where it formed the basis for the Soviet colour film industry.
In 1953 the plant became the property of East Germany, and in a trade agreement settlement, the East German company, VEB Film- und Chemiefaserwerk Agfa Wolfen, was given the right to sell its products under the Agfa brand in Eastern Europe, while the newly re-established Agfa in West German Leverkusen had the right to the name in the rest of the world.
As the trade agreement seriously hampered the East German company's abilities to sell in the West, the ORWO trademark (for Original Wolfen) was introduced in 1964. ORWO branded 35mm colour slide film became available in the United Kingdom in the 1970s through magazine advertisements for mail order suppliers. It was a cheaper alternative to the mainstream brands available at the time.
Following the merger of East Germany and West Germany, the company was privatised in 1990. After two bankruptcies, a new company, FilmoTec GmbH, was formed in 1998, which continues to manufacture a reduced range of former ORWO products, specialising in cine film. Some products are re-branded and sold by Maco.
The cellulose triacetate base manufacturing plant of ORWO was sold to Island Pyrochemical Industries, Mineola, NY. The new company, located in the Chemiepark, Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany, produces high quality TAC (triacetyl cellulose, aka cellulose triacetate) for the LCD polarizer market and the polarized sunglasses market.

The leather subculture denotes practices and styles of dress organized around sexual activities.  Wearing leather garments is one way that participants in this culture self-consciously distinguish themselves from mainstream sexual cultures. Leather culture is most visible in gay communities and most often associated with gay men ("leathermen"), but it is also reflected in various ways in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and straight worlds. Many people associate leather culture with BDSM (Bondage/Discipline, Dominance/Submission, Sado/Masochism, also called "SM" or "S&M") practices and its many subcultures.

CATEGORIES: Denial-of-service attacks

The Smurf Attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP Broadcast address. Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim's computer will be flooded with traffic. This can slow down the victim's computer to the point where it becomes impossible to work on.
The name Smurf comes from the file "smurf.c", the source code of the attack program, which was released in 1997 by TFreak.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.phreak.org/archives/exploits/denial/smurf.c | title = Phreak.org exploits archive: smurf.c[/tpl]

The Last Poets is the name for several groups of poets and musicians who arose from the late 1960s African-American civil rights movement's black nationalist movement. The name is taken from a poem by the South African revolutionary poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, who believed he was in the last era of poetry before guns would take over. The original users of that name were the trio of Felipe Luciano, Gylan Kain, and David Nelson.
However, it is the versions of the group led by Jalaluddin Masur Nuriddin and/or Umar Bin Hassan that have penetrated mass culture to a legendary degree. The Last Poets have been cited as one of the earliest influences on hip-hop music. Critic Jason Ankeny wrote: "With their politically charged raps, taut rhythms, and dedication to raising African-American consciousness, the Last Poets almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the emergence of hip-hop."Ankeny, Jason, Allmusic.com profile of Last Poets; URL accessed February 01, 2007. The British music magazine NME stated, "Serious spokesmen like Gil Scott-Heron, The Last Poets, and later Gary Byrd,  paved the way for the many socially committed Black emcees a decade later."

[[Riemann sum]]
CATEGORIES: Integral calculus

In mathematics, a Riemann sum is an approximation of the area of a region, often the region underneath a curve. It is named after German mathematician Bernhard Riemann.
The sum is calculated by dividing the region up into shapes (rectangles or trapezoids) that together form a region that is similar to the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes, and finally adding all of these small areas together. This approach can be used to find a numerical approximation for a definite integral even if the fundamental theorem of calculus does not make it easy to find a closed-form solution.
Because the region filled by the small shapes is usually not exactly the same shape as the region being measured, the Riemann sum will differ from the area being measured. This error can be reduced by dividing up the region more finely, using smaller and smaller shapes. As the shapes get smaller and smaller, the sum approaches the Riemann integral.

Joe Versus the Volcano is a 1990 American romantic comedy film written and directed by John Patrick Shanley and starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The film is about a man who, after being told he is dying of a rare disease, accepts a financial offer to travel to a tropical island and throw himself, passionately, into a volcano. Along the way he meets and falls in love with a woman who shows him how to truly live.
Despite positive reviews from some critics, including Roger Ebert who described the film as "new and fresh and not shy of taking chances", the film was a box office flop.

A patriarchate is the office or jurisdiction of a patriarch. A patriarch, as the term is used here, is either,
The five patriarchs of the Pentarchy sat in Rome, Constantinople (now Istanbul), Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. The East-West Schism of 1054 split the Latin-speaking see of Rome from the four Greek-speaking patriarchates, forming distinct Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. The Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch moved to Damascus in the 13th century, during the reign of the Egyptian Mamelukes, conquerors of Syria. In Damascus a Christian community had flourished since apostolic times (Acts 9). However, the patriarchate is still called the Patriarchate of Antioch. Damascus is the seat also of the Syrian Catholic and the Melkite Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch, while the Maronite Catholic of Antioch lives in Bkerké, Lebanon.Annuario Pontificio 2012, pp. 3-5
The four early Orthodox patriarchates of the East, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, along with their counterpart in the West, Rome, are distinguished[tpl]by whom?|date=May 2012[/tpl] as "senior" (Greek: πρεσβυγενή, presbygenē, "senior-born") or "ancient" (παλαίφατα, palaíphata, "of ancient fame") and are among the apostolic sees, having had one of the Apostles or Evangelists as their first bishop: Andrew, Mark, Peter, James, and Peter again, respectively.
A patriarchate has "legal personality" in some legal jurisdictions, that means it is treated as a corporation. For example, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem filed a lawsuit in New York, decided in 1999, against Christie's Auction House, disputing the ownership of the Archimedes Palimpsest.
The head of the Czechoslovak Hussite Church is also called a Patriarch.

The Portland Sea Dogs are a minor league baseball team based in Portland, Maine that currently plays in the Eastern League. The team is sanctioned in the Eastern Division. Established in 1994, the Sea Dogs are the Double-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. 
The Sea Dogs became part of the Red Sox system for the 2003 season; previously they were affiliated with the Florida Marlins. The change in affiliation brought success in the 2005 and 2006 seasons as the Sea Dogs went to the Eastern League championship series both years. They won their first-ever title on September 17, 2006, defeating the Akron Aeros 8–5 in a rematch of the series from the previous year. It was the first double-A championship for a Red Sox farm team since 1983 when they were based in New Britain, Connecticut.
The Sea Dogs' home stadium is Hadlock Field, named after long-time Portland High School baseball coach Edison Hadlock.  It currently has a seating capacity of 7,368. Hadlock Field is often visited by vacationing celebrities, such as former NFL coach Bill Parcells, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush, and his wife Barbara. In left field stands the Maine Monster, a 37-foot-tall replica of Fenway Park's Green Monster, complete with Coke bottle and Citgo sign. Along the right-field foul line just beyond first base, a picnic pavilion is available for group outings from 20 up to 300 people. In 2006, a new pavilion opened above the right-field wall over the Sea Dogs bullpen. Modeled after the Green Monster seats at Fenway Park in Boston, it seats up to 393 people and gives fans an opportunity to catch a home run ball.  Currently all games are carried on a network of radio stations with Mike Antonellis providing the play-by-play, with the flagship WPEI and select TV games on NESN with Eric Frede play-by-play and former Red Sox relief pitcher Ken Ryan.
Sea Dogs games are frequented by the team's official mascot Slugger the Sea Dog.

The Beggar's Operahttp://www.bibliomania.com/0/6/2/1088/frameset.html is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by John Gay with music arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch. It is one of the watershed plays in Augustan drama and is the only example of the once thriving genre of satirical ballad opera to remain popular today. Ballad operas were satiric musical plays that used some of the conventions of opera, but without recitative. The lyrics of the airs in the piece are set to popular broadsheet ballads, opera arias, church hymns and folk tunes of the time.
The Beggar's Opera premiered at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre on 29 January 1728[tpl]cite book|title=Penguin Pocket On This Day|publisher=Penguin Reference Library|isbn=0-14-102715-0|year=2006[/tpl] and ran for 62 consecutive performances, the longest run in theatre history up to that time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&&&www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html|title=Stage Beauty[/tpl] The work became Gay's greatest success and has been played ever since. In 1920, The Beggar's Opera began an astonishing revival run of 1,463 performances at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith, London, which was one of the longest runs in history for any piece of musical theatre at that time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html|title=Long runs|work=World Theatres[/tpl]
The piece satirised Italian opera, which had become popular in London. According to The New York Times: "Gay wrote the work more as an anti-opera than an opera, one of its attractions to its 18th-century London public being its lampooning of the Italian opera style and the English public's fascination with it."Dobin's Beggars Opera websiteKozinn, Allan. "The Beggar's Opera, An 18th-Century Satire", The New York Times, 10 May 1990, accessed 6 November 2009 Instead of the grand music and themes of opera, the work uses familiar tunes and characters that were ordinary people. Some of the songs were by opera composers like Handel, but only the most popular of these were used. The audience could hum along with the music and identify with the characters. The story satirised politics, poverty and injustice, focusing on the theme of corruption at all levels of society. Lavinia Fenton, the first Polly Peachum, became an overnight success. Her pictures were in great demand, verses were written to her and books published about her. After appearing in several comedies, and then in numerous repetitions of The Beggars Opera, she ran away with her married lover, Charles Paulet, 3rd Duke of Bolton.
Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill adapted the opera into Die Dreigroschenoper (The Threepenny Opera) in 1928, sticking close to the original plot and characters but with a new libretto and mostly new music.

The MC.200 had excellent manoeuvrability and general flying characteristics left little to be desired.Munson 1960, p. 34. Stability in a high-speed dive was exceptional,Spick  1997, p. 116. but it was underpowered and underarmed for a modern fighter.Ethell 1995, p. 68.
From the time Italy entered war on 10 June 1940, until the armistice of 8 September 1943, the C. 200  flew more operational sorties than any Italian aircraft. The Saetta  ranged over Greece, North Africa, Yugoslavia, across the  Mediterranean and Russia (where it obtained an excellent kill to loss ratio of 88 to 15).De Marchi and Tonizzo 1994, p. 10.Ethell 1995, p. 70.  Its very strong all-metal construction  and air-cooled engine made the aircraft ideal for ground attack and several units flew it as a fighter-bomber. Over 1,000 were built by the time the war ended.Ethell 1995, p. 69.

The Macchi C.202 ''Folgore (Italian "thunderbolt") was a World War II fighter aircraft built by Macchi Aeronautica and operated mainly by the Regia Aeronautica (RA; Royal (Italian) Air Force). Macchi aircraft designed by Mario Castoldi received the "C" letter in their model designation, hence the Folgore is referred to as the C.202 or MC.202. The C.202 was a development of the earlier C.200 Saetta, with an Italian built version of the Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa engine and with a redesigned, more streamlined fuselage.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 219. Considered to be one of the best wartime fighters to serve in large numbers with the Regia Aeronautica,Mondey 2006, p. 155. the Folgore'' operated on all fronts in which Italy was involved.Matricardi 2006, pp. 70–71.
The Folgore went into service with the Regia Aeronautica in July 1941 and immediately proved to be an effective and deadly dogfighter.Sgarlato 1998, pp. 8–20.Winchester 2004, p. 172. The Australian ace Clive Caldwell, who fought a wide variety of German, Italian and Japanese fighters during 1941–45, later stated that the C.202 was "one of the best and most undervalued of fighters".Dunning 2000, p. 209. Nonetheless, the C.202 had its defects: like its predecessor, the Macchi C.200, it could enter a dangerous spin.Duma 2007, pp. 232–233. It was insufficiently armed, with just two machine guns that easily jammed. The radios were unreliable, forcing the pilots to communicate by waggling wings. The oxygen system was inefficient, causing 50 to 60 per cent of the pilots to break off missions, sometimes even causing fatal accidents.

The C.205 was a development of the earlier C.202 Folgore.
With a top speed of some 400 mph and equipped with a pair of 20 mm cannon as well as 12.7 mm Breda machine guns, the Macchi C.205 Veltro was highly respected by Allied and Luftwaffe pilots alike. Regarded as the best Italian aircraft of World War II

However, while the C.205 was able to match the best Allied opponents in speed and maneuverability, it was introduced late in the conflict. Moreover, due to the poor Italian industrial capability of the time, only a small production run was delivered before the end of the war. Like the Spitfire, the Veltro was tricky (in its construction) and thus slow to build.Glancey 2006, pp. 166–168. Italy's highest scoring ace, Adriano Visconti, achieved 11 of his 26 credited victories in the few weeks he was able to fly the Veltro, with the top scoring 205 Sergente Maggiore pilota Luigi Gorrini shooting down 14 enemy aircraft plus six damaged with the C.205.Sgarlato 1998, pp. 8–20.

[[Culture of Iraq]]

CATEGORIES: Iraqi culture, Fertile Crescent

Iraq has one of the world's oldest cultural histories. Iraq is where the Ancient Mesopotamian civilizations were, whose legacy went on to influence and shape the civilizations of the Old World. Culturally, Iraq has a very rich heritage. The country is known for its poets and its painters and sculptors are among the best in the Arab world, some of them being world-class. Iraq is known for producing fine handicrafts, including rugs and carpets. The architecture of Iraq is seen in the sprawling metropolis of Baghdad, where the construction is mostly new, with some islands of exquisite old buildings and compounds, and elsewhere in thousands of ancient and modern sites across Iraq. 
Unlike many Arab countries, Iraq embraces and celebrates the achievements of its past in pre-Islamic times. What is now Iraq was once the Cradle of Civilization in Ancient Mesopotamia and the culture of Sumer, where writing and the wheel were invented.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] In the 8th and 9th centuries, the Islamic Abbasid Caliph's presided over what was then one of the world's richest civilizations.

Proton (Russian: Протон) (formal designation: UR-500) is an expendable launch system used for both commercial and Russian government space launches. The first Proton rocket was launched in 1965 and the launch system is still in use as of 2014, which makes it one of the most successful heavy boosters in the history of spaceflight. All Protons are built at the Khrunichev plant in Moscow, and then transported for launch to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where they are brought to the launch pad horizontally and then raised into vertical position for launch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ilslaunch.com/launch-services/proton-mission-planners-guide |title=Proton Mission Planner's Guide |publisher=International Launch Services[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexpgp/40437004/ |date=September 5, 2005|title=Proton Verticalization, Pad 39, Baikonur |publisher=flickr[/tpl]
Like many Soviet boosters, the names of recurring payloads became associated with their launchers. Thus the moniker "Proton" originates from a series of large scientific Proton satellites, which were among the rocket's first payloads. During the Cold War, it was designated the D-1/D-1e or SL-12/SL-13 by Western intelligence agencies.

It was first used in later stages of the Philippine-American War, and was widely used in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The M1911 is still carried by some U.S. forces. Its formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 for the original Model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924. The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam era. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols in military contracts during its service life. The M1911 was replaced by the 9mm Beretta M9 pistol as the standard U.S. sidearm in the early 1990s, but due to its popularity among users, it has not been completely phased out.  Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the U.S. Army Special Forces, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.
Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols.  It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as USPSA, IDPA, International Practical Shooting Confederation, and Bullseye shooting. Compact variants are popular civilian concealed carry weapons, because of the design's inherent slim width and the power of the .45 ACP cartridge.[tpl]cite book|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|authorlink=Massad Ayoob|title=The Gun Digest Book of Combat Handgunnery|year=2007|publisher=Gun Digest Books|isbn=978-0-89689-525-6|page=7[/tpl]

[[Biscayne National Park]]
CATEGORIES: Biscayne National Park, National parks in Florida, Parks in Miami-Dade County, Florida, Swamps of Florida

Biscayne National Park is a U.S. National Park located in southern Florida, south of Miami. The park preserves Biscayne Bay and its offshore barrier reefs, some of the best scuba diving and snorkeling areas in the United States. Ninety-five percent of the park is water, and the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive mangrove forest. The park covers [tpl]convert|172,971|acre[/tpl] and includes Elliott Key, the park's largest island and first of the true Florida Keys, formed from fossilized coral reef. The islands farther north in the park are transitional islands of coral and sand. The offshore portion of the park includes the northernmost region of the Florida Reef, one of the largest coral reefs in the world.
Biscayne National Park protects four distinct ecosystems: the shoreline mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps of the mainland and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges and soft corals, as well as manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including the Schaus' swallowtail butterfly, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.
The people of the Glades culture inhabited the Biscayne Bay region as early as 10,000 years ago before rising sea levels filled the bay. The Tequesta people occupied the islands and shoreline from about 4,000 years before the present to the 16th century, when the Spanish took possession of Florida. Reefs claimed ships from Spanish times through the 20th century, with more than 40 documented wrecks within the park's boundaries. While the park's islands were farmed during the 19th and early 20th centuries, their rocky soil and periodic hurricanes made agriculture difficult to sustain.  In the early 20th century the islands became secluded destinations for wealthy Miamians who built getaway homes and social clubs. Mark C. Honeywell's guesthouse on Boca Chita Key was the area's most elaborate private retreat, featuring a mock lighthouse. The Cocolobo Cay Club was at various times owned by Miami developer Carl G. Fisher, yachtsman Garfield Wood, and Richard Nixon's friend Bebe Rebozo, and was visited by four United States presidents. The amphibious community of Stiltsville was established in the 1930s in the shoals of northern Biscayne Bay, taking advantage of its remoteness from land to offer offshore gambling and alcohol during Prohibition. Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, Elliott Key was used as a training ground for infiltrators into Castro's Cuba by the Central Intelligence Agency and by Cuban exile groups.
Originally proposed for inclusion in Everglades National Park, Biscayne Bay was cut from the proposed park to ensure Everglades' establishment. It remained undeveloped until the 1960s, when a series of proposals were made to develop the keys in the manner of Miami Beach, and to construct a deepwater seaport for bulk cargo, along with refinery and petrochemical facilities on the mainland shore of Biscayne Bay.  Through the 1960s and 1970s, two fossil-fueled power plants and two nuclear power plants were built on the bay shores. A backlash against development led to the 1968 designation of Biscayne National Monument. The preserved area was expanded by its 1980 re-designation as Biscayne National Park. The park is heavily used by boaters, and apart from the park's visitor center on the mainland, its land and sea areas are accessible only by boat.

[[Standard molar entropy]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical properties, Thermodynamic entropy

In chemistry, the standard molar entropy is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under standard conditions (not standard temperature and pressure STP).
The standard molar entropy is usually given the symbol S°, and as units of joules per mole kelvin (J mol−1 K−1). Unlike standard enthalpies of formation, the value of S° is an absolute.  That is, an element in its standard state has a nonzero value of S° at room temperature. The entropy of a pure crystalline structure can be 0 J mol−1 K−1 only at 0 K, according to the third law of thermodynamics. However, this presupposes that the material forms a 'perfect crystal' without any frozen in entropy (defects, dislocations), which is never completely true because crystals always grow at a finite temperature.  This residual entropy is often quite negligible.

American Motors Corporation (AMC) was an American automobile company formed by the 1954 merger of Nash-Kelvinator Corporation and Hudson Motor Car Company. At the time, it was the largest corporate merger in U.S. history.[tpl]citation |title=American Cars, 1946-1959: Every Model, Year by Year |first=J. Kelly |last=Flory |publisher=McFarland |year=2008 |page=545 |isbn=9780786452309[/tpl].
George W. Mason was the architect of the merger to reap benefits from the strengths of the two firms to battle the much larger "Big Three" automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). Within a year, George W. Romney, future governor of Michigan, took over, reorganizing the company and focusing AMC's future on a new small car line.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861782,00.html | title=Gamble on the Rambler |magazine=Time | date=December 19, 1955 |accessdate=February 8, 2011[/tpl] By the end of 1957 the original Nash and Hudson brands were completely phased out. The company struggled at first, but Rambler sales took off. A Rambler won the 1959 Mobil Economy Run and by 1960, was the third most popular brand of automobile in the United States, behind Ford and Chevrolet.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864627,00.html |title=Autos: Victory for Rambler |journal=Time |date=April 20, 1959 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm| title=1965–1966 Rambler Ambassador |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com|date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=February 8, 2011[/tpl] After two model years (1963 and 1964) of only producing compact cars, AMC focused back to larger and more profitable cars like the Ambassador line from the perceived negative of the Rambler's economy car image. In the face of deteriorating financial and market positions, Roy D. Chapin, Jr., took charge to revitalize the company, and designer Richard A. Teague economized by developing several vehicles from common stampings. While prices and costs were cut, new and more sporty automobiles were introduced, and from 1968 AMC became known for the Javelin and AMX muscle cars.
AMC purchased Kaiser's Jeep utility vehicle operations in 1970 to complement their existing passenger car business. Beginning in the early 1970s, they moved towards all-new compact car designs based on the Hornet, including the Hornet itself and the Gremlin. Other new models in the 1970s included the Matador and Pacer. In an effort to create a more efficient cost structure, in the 1979 model year, AMC eliminated the Matador line and then in the 1980 model year, eliminated the Pacer, focusing almost exclusively on their Hornet-based cars and the Jeep line. While the new lines of the late 1970s, such as the Spirit and Concord, were variations on the Hornet's platform, the company continued with innovations on existing designs: the 4-wheel-drive AMC Eagle, introduced in 1979, was one of the first true crossovers.
From 1980, AMC partnered with France's Renault to help finance their manufacturing operations, obtain much-needed capital, and source subcompact vehicles. By 1983 Renault had a controlling interest in AMC. In the 1983 model year, the AMC brand focused entirely on AWD autos; the company stopped producing two wheel drive cars. AMC facilities were used to produce Renault Alliance and Encore compact and subcompact cars. In 1985 Chrysler entered an agreement with AMC to produce Dodge Diplomats and Plymouth Furys as well as Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons in AMC's Kenosha, Wisconsin plant. At the time, AMC had excess manufacturing capacity thus contract manufacturing for Chrysler made sense.

Chrysler made a public offer to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares of AMC stock on the NYSE. Renault left the US market completely as a brand in 1987. The Renault Medallion was sold through the newly formed Jeep Eagle Division of Chrysler as an Eagle, not a Renault. AMC's badge would be used on the Eagle Sports Wagon through the 1988 model year, then be eliminated entirely.   The Jeep/Eagle division of Chrysler Corporation was formed from the AMC Jeep Renault dealer network. The Jeep and Eagle vehicles were marketed primarily by former AMC dealers. Ultimately, the Eagle Brand of car would be phased out like Chrysler's DeSoto, Plymouth, and Imperial by 1998.

However, when comparing its average depth of [tpl]convert|1148|ft|m[/tpl] to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third deepest in the world.  The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical [tpl]convert|4000|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] deep caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Range.

This National Park encompasses [tpl]convert|183225|acre|mi2 km2|2[/tpl].  Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage.

The House of Hanover (the Hanoverians [tpl]IPAc-en|,|h|æ|n|ə|'|v|ɪər|ɪ|ə|n|z|[/tpl]) is a German royal dynasty which has ruled the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg ([tpl]lang-de|Braunschweig-Lüneburg[/tpl]), the Kingdom of Hanover, the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Kingdom of Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It succeeded the House of Stuart as monarchs of Great Britain and Ireland in 1714 and held that office until the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. They are sometimes referred to as the House of Brunswick and Lüneburg, Hanover line.
The House of Hanover is a younger branch of the House of Welf, which in turn is the senior branch of the House of Este.
Queen Victoria was the granddaughter of George III and was an ancestor of most major European royal houses. She arranged marriages for her children and grandchildren across the continent, tying Europe together; this earned her the nickname "the grandmother of Europe". She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover; her son King Edward VII belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father, Albert, Prince Consort. Under semi-Salic law, Victoria could not inherit the Kingdom of Hanover and the Duchies unless the entire male line became extinct; those possessions passed to the next eligible male heir, her uncle Ernest Augustus I of Hanover, the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale—the fifth son of George III.
The current head of the House of Hanover is Ernst August V, Prince of Hanover.

Logan the Orator (c. 1723?–1780) was a Native American orator and war leader born in the Iroquois Confederacy[tpl]specify|date=August 2013[/tpl].  Although he was of the Cayuga nation, after his 1760s move to the Ohio Country, he was sometimes referred to as a Mingo.   His revenge for the killing of family members by American frontiersmen helped spark the 1774 conflict known as Dunmore's War. Logan became famous for a speech, later known as "Logan's Lament", which he reportedly delivered after the war. Important details about Logan have been disputed by scholars, including his original name and whether or not the words of "Logan's Lament" were actually his.

Knott's Berry Farm is a [tpl]Convert|160|acre|adj=on[/tpl] theme park in Buena Park, California, owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Since the theme park's acquisition by Cedar Fair, the park's annual attendance has steadily increased. The 2012 Global Attractions Attendance Report states Knott's Berry Farm is the 14th most visited theme park in North America.[tpl]cite web|title=2012 Global Attractions Attendance Report|url=http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/2012%20Theme%20Index%20Combined_1-1_online.pdf|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association[/tpl] The theme park has approximately 10,000 seasonal/full-time employees.http://www.linkedin.com/company/knott's-berry-farm The park has a well rounded roster of roller coasters, family rides, children rides, water rides and historical rides totaling to 40 rides currently with plans to expand in the future. The park is accessible by public transportation.
The theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. Cordelia Knott's efforts in the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant were essential to putting Knott's Berry Farm on the map, and the ensuing crowds prompted the creation of even more tourist attractions.  In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property. Knott added several other attractions over the years, and began charging admission to the attractions in 1968. In 1983, Knott's Berry Farm added Camp Snoopy, which began the park's present-day association with the Peanuts characters.
In the 1990s, following the deaths of Walter and Cordelia Knott, their children sold the family business; the theme park was sold to Cedar Fair, while the food business was sold to ConAgra Foods, which subsequently sold to J. M. Smucker; Smucker's discontinued the line in 2013. Cedar Fair has continued to expand the theme park, adding Knott's Soak City in 1999 and adding other rides to the original park.

[[Log flume]]

CATEGORIES: Log transport, Water transport, Aqueducts

A log flume is a flume specifically constructed to transport lumber and logs down mountainous terrain to a sawmill by using flowing water.  These watertight trough-like channels could be built to span a long distance across chasms and down steep mountain slopes. The use of log flumes facilitated the quick and cheap transportation of logs and thereby eliminated the need for horse- or oxen-drawn carriages on dangerous mountain trails.
Early flumes were square chutes that were prone to jams that could cause damage and required constant maintenance. In 1868, James W. Haines first built the "V" shaped log flumes that allowed a jammed log to free itself as the rising water level in the flume pushed it up. These efficient flumes consisted of 2 boards, [tpl]convert|2|ft|m[/tpl] wide, joined perpendicularly, and came in common use in the western United States during the late 19th century.
The longest log flume was reputedly the Kings River Flume in Sanger, California. Built in 1890 by the Kings River Lumber Company, it spanned over [tpl]convert|62|mi|km[/tpl] from the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the lumber yard and railroad depot in Sanger. Together with a constant water supply from a nearby reservoir, the flume enabled the efficient transportation of boards of lumber over deep gorges and cliffs and thereby opened up the area now known as Sequoia National Forest for clearcutting of the giant Redwood forests. Proper operation was ensured by "flume herders" who at various locations along the flume checked the flow of lumber and water.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sangerdepotmuseum.com/flume.html |title=The Kings River Flume |publisher=Sanger Depot Museum |accessdate=2012-01-13[/tpl]
On occasion, despite being exceedingly dangerous, flume herders and others would ride down the flume in small crafts or boats, either for inspection or for thrills. Such rides were the precursor of the modern log-ride amusement park attractions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thestormking.com/Buy_Books/Books/The_Flume/the_flume.html |title=Dare to Shoot the Flume |publisher=Mic Mac Media |author=Mark McLaughlin |accessdate=2010-03-04[/tpl]

The sweet, cake-like Amish cinnamon bread is a common bread that is made from this starter; it is a simple, stirred quickbread that includes a substantial amount of sugar and vegetable oil, with a mild cinnamon flavor. It has characteristics of both pound cake and coffee cake. The flavor of the finished product can be altered by omitting cinnamon.
A common recipe using this starter suggests using one cup (240 ml) of it to make bread, keeping one cup to start a new cycle, and giving the remaining three cups to friends.  The process of sharing the starter makes it somewhat like a chain letter.  One cup of starter makes one standard loaf of bread.

[[Degrees of freedom]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical terminology, Concepts in physics, Dimension

In many scientific fields, the degrees of freedom of a system is the number of parameters of the system that may vary independently. For example, the position of a figure in the plane has three degrees of freedom: its orientation and the two coordinates of any fixed point of the figure. 
In mathematics, this notion is formalized as the dimension of a manifold or an algebraic variety. When degrees of freedom is used instead of dimension, this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined.

Seahouses is a large village on the North Northumberland coast in England. It is about 20 km north of Alnwick, within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
Seahouses attracts many visitors, mainly from the north east area. However national and international tourists often come to Seahouses whilst visiting the Northumberland National Park, Northumberland Coast and the Farne Islands. Seahouses also has a working fishing port, which also serves the tourist trade, being the embarkation point for visits to the Farne Islands. From shops in the town and booths along the harbour, several boat companies operate, offering various packages which may include inter alia landing on at least one Farne, seeing seals and seabirds, and hearing a commentary on the islands and the Grace Darling story or scuba diving on the many Farnes Islands wrecks. Grace Darling's brother is buried in the cemetery at North Sunderland. He died in 1903, aged 84. The current Seahouses lifeboat bears the name Grace Darling.
The Seahouses Festival is an annual cultural event which began in 1999 as a small Sea Shanty festival. After a significant European Funding grant from the Leader+ programme,  in 2005, http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=167692] it has grown into a more broadly based cultural celebration.
Between 1898 and 1951, Seahouses was the north-eastern terminus of the North Sunderland Railway.  Independent until its final closure, it formed a standard gauge rail link between the village and Chathill Station on the East Coast Main Line (Wright, 1988).  The site of Seahouses station is now the town carpark and the trackbed between village and North Sunderland is a public footpath.

"Hyperion" is an abandoned epic poem by 19th-century English Romantic poet John Keats. It is based on the Titanomachia, and tells of the despair of the Titans after their fall to the Olympians.  Keats wrote the poem from late 1818 until the spring of 1819, when he gave it up as having "too many Miltonic inversions."  He was also nursing his younger brother Tom, who died on 1 December 1818 of tuberculosis.  
The themes and ideas were picked up again in Keats's The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream, when he attempted to recast the epic by framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding.

In Greek mythology, Hyperion ([tpl]lang-el|Ὑπερίων[/tpl], "The High-One") was one of the twelve Titan children of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky or Heaven) who, led by Cronus, overthrew Uranus and were themselves later overthrown by the Olympians. With his sister, the Titaness Theia, Hyperion fathered Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn).Morford, p. 40; Keightley, p. 47; Smith,  "Hyperion" ; Hesiod, Theogony 134, 371; Hymn to Helios (31) 4–7; Apollodorus, 1.1.3;  1.2.2 The Homeric Hymn to Helios calls Hyperion's sister and mate "Euryphaëssa" probably, an epithet of Theia, see Morford, p. 61 and West 2003, note 61 p. 215. Other accounts make Selene the daughter of the Titan Pallas (Hymn to Hermes (4), 99–100) or of Helios (Euripides, The Phoenician Women 175 ff.; Nonnus, Dionysiaca 44.191).
Hyperion's son Helios was referred to in early mythological writings as Helios Hyperion ([tpl]lang|el|Ἥλιος Ὑπερίων[/tpl], "Sun High-one"). In Homer's Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, the Sun is once in each work called Hyperionides ([tpl]lang|el|Ὑπεριωνίδης[/tpl], "son of Hyperion"), and Hesiod certainly imagines Hyperion as a separate being in other writings. In later Greek literature, Hyperion is always distinguished from Helios; the former was ascribed the characteristics of the "God of Watchfulness, Wisdom and Light", while the latter became the physical incarnation of the Sun. Hyperion is an obscure figure in Greek culture and mythology, mainly appearing in lists of the twelve Titans:
There is little to no reference to Hyperion during the Titanomachy, the epic in which the Olympians battle the ruling Titans, or the Gigantomachy, in which Gaia attempts to avenge the Titans by enlisting the aid of the giants (Γίγαντες) that were imprisoned in Tartarus to facilitate the overthrow of the Olympians.
As the father of Helios, Hyperion was regarded as the "first principle" by Emperor Julian,[tpl]Citation|title=A Summary of Pythagorean Theology|url=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html|doi=[/tpl] though his relevance in Julian's notions of theurgy is unknown.

[[Roll film]]

CATEGORIES:  Film formats, Film formats, Photography equipment

Rollfilm or roll film is any type of spool-wound photographic film protected from white light exposure by a paper backing, as opposed to film which is protected from exposure and wound forward in a cartridge. Confusingly, roll film was originally often referred to as "cartridge" film because of its resemblance to a shotgun cartridge. The opaque backing paper allows roll film to be loaded in daylight. It is typically printed with frame number markings which can be viewed through a small red window at the rear of the camera. A spool of roll film is usually loaded on one side of the camera and pulled across to an identical take up spool on the other side of the shutter as exposures are made. When the roll is fully exposed, the take up spool is removed for processing and the empty spool on which the film was originally wound is moved to the other side, becoming the take up spool for the next roll of film.

The Glorious First of June (also known as the Third Battle of Ushant, and in France as the [tpl]lang|fr|''Bataille du 13 prairial an 2''[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|fr|''Combat de Prairial''[/tpl])A of 1794 was the first and largest fleet action of the naval conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the First French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars.
The British Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe attempted to prevent the passage of a vital French grain convoy from the United States, which was protected by the French Atlantic Fleet, commanded by Rear-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse. The two forces clashed in the Atlantic Ocean, some [tpl]convert|400|nmi|km|0[/tpl] west of the French island of Ushant on 1 June 1794.
The action was the culmination of a campaign that had criss-crossed the Bay of Biscay over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial, but inconclusive, fleet actions. During the battle, Howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the French and for each of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent. This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains, and as a result his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered and in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returning to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe's fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.
The Glorious First of June demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the French and British navies at the start of the Revolutionary Wars – both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains and ill-discipline and poor training among their crews. During the height of the combat they both failed to control their fleets effectively, their ships suffering further from a shortage of crewmen and reliable officers. In Britain the conduct of a number of officers was subsequently called into question and one even faced a court martial for his conduct, leaving a lasting legacy of bitterness in the Royal Navy.

[[Medium format (film)]]

CATEGORIES: Film formats

Medium format has traditionally referred to a film format in still photography and the related cameras and equipment that use that film. Generally, the term applies to film and digital cameras that record images on media larger than 24 by 36 mm (full-frame) (used in 35 mm photography), but smaller than 4 by 5 inches (which is considered to be large-format photography).
In digital photography, medium format refers either to cameras adapted from medium format film photography uses, or to cameras making use of sensors larger than that of a 35 mm film frame. Often, medium format film cameras can be retrofitted with digital camera backs, converting them to digital cameras, but some of these digital backs, especially early models, use sensors smaller than a 35 mm film frame. As of 2013, medium format digital photography sensors were available in sizes of up to 40 by 53 mm, with 60 million pixels for use with commonly available professional medium format cameras. Sensors used in special applications such as spy satellites can be even larger, but are not necessarily described as medium format equipment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In the film world, medium format has moved from being the most widely used film size (1900s through 1950s) to a niche used by professionals and some amateur enthusiasts, but one which is still substantially more popular than large format. In digital, medium format is a very expensive option, with typical brand new all-digital medium format cameras retailing for $10,000 (Mamiya ZD) to $32,000 (Hasselblad H3D) in 2008.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
While at one time or another a variety of medium format film sizes were produced, today the vast majority of  medium format film is produced in the 6 cm 120 and 220 sizes. Other sizes are mainly produced for use in antique cameras, and many people assume 120/220 film when the term medium format is used.
The general rule with consumer cameras—as opposed to specialized industrial, scientific, and military equipment—is the more cameras sold, the more sophisticated the automation features available.  Medium format cameras made since the 1950s are generally less automated than smaller cameras made at the same time, having high image quality as their primary advantage. For example, autofocus became available in consumer 35 mm cameras in 1977, but did not reach medium format until the late 1990s, and has never been available in a consumer large format camera.

[[Operon]]

CATEGORIES: Gene expression

In genetics, an operon is a functioning unit of genomic DNA containing a cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter.[tpl]cite book|title=Life: The Science of Biology|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|edition=9th|isbn=978-1-4292-1962-4|page=349|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ANT8VB14oBUC&pg=PA349|author=Sadava, David et al.[/tpl] The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo trans-splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be co-transcribed to define an operon.[ref]
[tpl]Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.[/tpl][/ref]
Originally, operons were thought to exist solely in prokaryotes, but since the discovery of the first operons in eukaryotes in the early 1990s,[tpl]cite pmid|8098272[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid| 9155028 [/tpl] more evidence has arisen to suggest they are more common than previously assumed.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/bfgp/3.3.199[/tpl] In general, expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of polycistronic mRNAs, while eukaryotic operons lead to monocistronic mRNAs.
Operons are also found in viruses such as bacteriophages.[tpl]cite web| title=Definition of Operon| url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32917| work=Medical Dictionary| publisher=MedicineNet.com| accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Displacements of Prohead Protease Genes in the Late Operons of Double-Stranded-DNA Bacteriophages|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|date=1 March 2004|url=http://jb.asm.org/content/186/13/4369.short|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl] For example, T7 phages have two operons—the first one codes for various products including a special T7 RNA polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operon—which includes a lysis gene meant to cause the host cell to burst.[tpl]cite web|title=Bacteriophage Use Operons|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cbbc/courses/bio4/bio4-lectures/ProkGeneControl.html|work=Prokaryotic Gene Control|publisher=Dartmouth College|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl]

Polaroid Corporation is an American-based international consumer electronics and eyewear company, founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land. It is most famous for its instant film cameras, which reached the market in 1948, and continued to be the company's flagship product line until the February 2008 decision to cease all production in favor of digital photography products.[tpl]cite news |last=Jewell |first = Mark |title = After 60 years, Polaroid quits instant film business |agency=Associated Press |date=2008-02-08 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/02/08/after_60_years_polaroid_quits_its_instant_film_business/|accessdate=2008-02-16[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The company's original dominant market was in polarized sunglasses, an outgrowth of Land's self-guided research in polarization after leaving Harvard University after his freshman year—he later returned to Harvard to continue his research.
After Polaroid defeated Kodak in a patent battle, Kodak left the instant camera business on January 9, 1986.
Polaroid developed an instant movie system, Polavision, based on the Dufaycolor process.  The product arrived on the market when videotape-based systems were rapidly gaining popularity.  As a result, Polavision was unsuccessful and most of the manufactured product was sold off as a job lot at immense cost to the company. Its underlying technology was later improved for use in the Polachrome instant slide film system.
The company also was one of the early manufacturers of digital cameras, with the PDC-2000 in 1996;Polaroid PDC-2000 Digital Camera however, they failed to capture a large market 
share in that segment.
They also made 35 mm and multi format scanners, such as Polaroid SpiritScan 4000 35 mm scanner (the first scanner with a 4000 DPI CCD) in 1999, and the Polaroid PrintScan 120 in 2000, the scanners had mixed reception and had heavy competition with Nikon and Minolta. All the line was discontinued after the firm went bankrupt.
On October 11, 2001, Polaroid Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Almost all the company's assets (including the "Polaroid" name itself, which had become almost synonymous with instant photographs) were sold to a subsidiary of Bank One. They went on to form a new company, which also operates under the name "Polaroid Corporation"."Polaroid and One Equity Partners Complete Asset Acquisition", New Polaroid Corporation. Press release dated 2002-07-31, retrieved 2006-12-01.

The renamed "old" Polaroid now exists solely as an administrative shell.Front page, Primary PDC website. Retrieved 2006-11-30. Its bankruptcy was widely believed to be the result of the failure of its senior management to anticipate the effect of digital cameras on its film business.
On December 18, 2008, the post-reorganization Polaroid Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota.  The bankruptcy filing came shortly after the criminal investigation of its parent company, Petters Group Worldwide, and the parent company founder, Tom Petters.Front page, Bloomberg News.

[[Well-posed problem]]

CATEGORIES: Numerical analysis, Partial differential equations

The mathematical term well-posed problem stems from a definition given by Jacques Hadamard. He believed that mathematical models of physical phenomena should have the properties that
Examples of archetypal well-posed problems include the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation, and the heat equation with specified initial conditions. These might be regarded as 'natural' problems in that there are physical processes modelled by these problems. 
Problems that are not well-posed in the sense of Hadamard are termed ill-posed.  Inverse problems are often ill-posed. For example, the inverse heat equation, deducing a previous distribution of temperature from final data, is not well-posed in that the solution is highly sensitive to changes in the final data.
Continuum models must often be discretized in order to obtain a numerical solution. While solutions may be continuous with respect to the initial conditions, they may suffer from numerical instability when solved with finite precision, or with errors in the data. Even if a problem is well-posed, it may still be ill-conditioned, meaning that a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the answers.  An ill-conditioned problem is indicated by a large condition number.
If the problem is well-posed, then it stands a good chance of solution on a computer using a stable algorithm.  If it is not well-posed, it needs to be re-formulated for numerical treatment. Typically this involves including additional assumptions, such as smoothness of solution. This process is known as regularization. Tikhonov regularization is one of the most commonly used for regularization of linear ill-posed problems.

[tpl]Other uses of|Brownie|Brownie (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Brownie[/tpl]
Brownie is the name of a long-running popular series of simple and inexpensive cameras made by Eastman Kodak. The Brownie popularized low-cost photography and introduced the concept of the snapshot. The first Brownie, introduced in February 1900,List of Brownie models at George Eastman House[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] was a very basic cardboard box camera with a simple meniscus lens that took 2¼-inch square pictures on 117 rollfilm. With its simple controls and initial price of $1, it was intended to be a camera that anyone could afford and use, hence the slogan, "You push the button, we do the rest." The camera was named after the popular cartoons created by Palmer Cox.
One of the most popular Brownie models was the Brownie 127, millions of which were sold between 1952 and 1967. The Brownie 127 was a simple bakelite camera for 127 film which featured a simple meniscus lens and a curved film plane to compensate for the deficiencies of the lens.  Another simple camera was the Brownie Cresta which was sold between 1955 and 1958.  It used 120 film and had a fixed-focus lens.
Having written an article in the 1940s for amateur photographers suggesting an expensive camera was unnecessary for quality photography, Picture Post photographer Bert Hardy used a Brownie camera to stage a carefully posed snapshot of two young women sitting on railings above a breezy Blackpool promenade.Bert Hardy snapshot
In 1908, the Austrian architectural critic Joseph August Lux wrote a book called Künstlerische Kodakgeheimnisse (Artistic Secrets of the Kodak) in which he championed the use of the camera for its cultural potential. Guided by a position that was influenced by the Catholic critique of modernity, he argued that the accessibility the camera provided for the amateur meant that people could photograph and document their surroundings and thus produce a type of stability in the ebb and flow of the modern world.Mark Jarzombek.

[[Audio feedback]]
CATEGORIES: Audio effects, Audio electronics

Audio feedback (also known as acoustic feedback, simply as feedback, or the Larsen effect) is a special kind of positive feedback which occurs when a sound loop exists between an audio input (for example, a microphone or guitar pickup) and an audio output (for example, a loudspeaker). In this example, a signal received by the microphone is amplified and passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again.  The frequency of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker, and the distance between them. For small PA systems the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech.
The principles of audio feedback were first discovered by Danish scientist Søren Absalon Larsen.

[[The Open Championship]]
CATEGORIES: The Open Championship, 1860 establishments in the United Kingdom, Recurring sporting events established in 1860, Golf tournaments in England, Golf tournaments in Northern Ireland, Golf tournaments in Scotland

The Open Championship, or simply The Open (often referred to as the British Open), is the oldest of the four major championships in professional golf. It is the only major held outside the United States and is administered by the R&A, which is the governing body of golf outside the U.S. and Mexico. 
Since 1979, The Open has been played on the weekend of the third Friday in July. It is the third major of the calendar year, following The Masters and the U.S. Open, and preceding the PGA Championship. The current champion is Phil Mickelson, who won in 2013 at Muirfield in Gullane, East Lothian, Scotland. The Open moved to a Sunday finish in 1980; it had a scheduled Saturday finish from 1966 until 1979, with the first round on Wednesday. Prior to 1966, the final two rounds were scheduled for Friday. Before 1926, the four rounds were played in two days.
The event takes place annually on one of nine links courses in Scotland or England. It was held once in Northern Ireland, at Royal Portrush in 1951 but has not returned.
In 2012, The Open had a first prize of £900,000 (about $1.4 million) and a total prize fund of about £5 million (about $7.8 million). The 2013 Open will see a 5% increase in prize money, with a total fund of £5.25 million and a first prize of £945,000.[tpl]cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9428129/2013-open-championship-prize-money-soars |title=More prize money for Muirfield |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN |date=30 June 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2013[/tpl] The other three Major Championships in 2012 had first prizes of about $1.44 million and prize money of about $8 million, so that all four majors had almost identical prize money. Prize money is given to all professionals who make the cut and, since the number of professionals making the cut changes from year to year, the total prize money varies somewhat from the advertised number (currently £5.25 million).
The Open is a 72-hole stroke play tournament with a cut after 36 holes, limited to the top 70 players and ties. Unique among the four major championships, The Open features a four-hole playoff at the end of regulation, and continues into sudden-death if tied after four holes. Introduced in 1986, this format was first used in 1989; earlier playoffs were 36 holes until 1964, then 18 holes until 1986. The PGA Championship adopted a three-hole playoff, first used in 2000, after using sudden-death since 1977. (The Masters changed to sudden-death in the 1970s and the U.S. Open retains an 18-hole playoff.)

[[Scent hound]]
CATEGORIES: Hunting, Working dogs, Hunting with hounds

Scent hounds (Scenthounds) are a type of hound that primarily hunts by scent rather than sight. The Scenthound breeds are generally regarded as having some of the most sensitive noses among canines.
Scenthounds specialize in following a smell or scent. Most of these breeds have long, drooping ears. One theory says that this trait helps to collect scent from the air and keep it near the dog's face and nose. They also have large nasal cavities, the better to process scent. Their typically loose, moist lips are said to assist in trapping scent particles.
Most of these breeds have deep, booming voices and use them actively when running, and especially when following a scent trail. Although this can be a nuisance in settled areas, it is a valuable trait that allows the dog's handler to follow the dog or pack of dogs during a hunt even when they are out of sight, such as when following a fox or raccoon through woodland.
Scenthounds do not need to be as fast as sighthounds because they do not need to keep prey in sight, but they need endurance so that they can stick with a scent and follow it for long distances over rough terrain. The best scent hounds can follow a scent trail even across running water and even when it is several days old, which is a considerable amount more than a sighthound. Most scenthounds are used for hunting in packs, sometimes with multiple dogs in a single pack.  Longer-legged hounds run more quickly and usually require that the hunters follow on horseback; shorter-legged hounds allow hunters to follow on foot. Hunting with some breeds, such as German bracke, American Foxhounds, or coonhounds, involves allowing the pack of dogs to run freely while the hunters wait in a fixed spot until the dogs' baying announces that the game has been "treed". The hunters then go to the spot on foot, following the sound of the dogs' baying.Coon hunting on ESPN
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale places scenthounds into Group 6, and includes a Section 2 for Leash Hounds. These are a category of scenthound, including the Bavarian Mountain Scenthound (Bayrischer Gebirgsschweisshund, no. 217), the Hanoverian Scenthound (Hannover'scher Schweisshund, no. 213), and the Alpine Dachsbracke (Alpenländische Dachsbracke, no. 254). In addition, the Dalmatian and the Rhodesian Ridgeback are placed in Group 6 as "Related breeds".
The United Kennel Club divides its Scenthound Group into two categories. The first includes the American hunting dogs known as coonhounds and the European hounds from which they were developed. These are referred to as Tree Hounds. The second category is referred to as Trailing Scenthounds, and includes dogs used for tracking of both game and humans, reputedly descended from a type of bloodhound kept by monks in Belgium.[ref]United Kennel Club (US) breed information

[[Cylindrical coordinate system]]

CATEGORIES: Coordinate systems

A cylindrical coordinate system is a three-dimensional coordinate system
that specifies point positions by the distance from a chosen reference axis, the direction from the axis relative to a chosen reference direction, and the distance from a chosen reference plane perpendicular to the axis. The latter distance is given as a positive or negative number depending on which side of the reference plane faces the point.
The origin of the system is the point where all three coordinates can be given as zero. This is the intersection between the reference plane and the axis.
The axis is variously called the cylindrical or longitudinal axis, to differentiate it from
the polar axis, which is the ray that lies in the reference plane, 
starting at the origin and pointing in the reference direction.
The distance from the axis may be called the radial distance or radius, 
while the angular coordinate is sometimes referred to as the angular position or as the azimuth.
The radius and the azimuth are together called the polar coordinates, as they correspond to a two-dimensional polar coordinate system in the plane through the point, parallel to the reference plane.
The third coordinate may be called the height or altitude (if the reference plane is considered horizontal),

[[Neolithic architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural history

Neolithic architecture refers to structures encompassing housing and shelter from approximately 10,000 to 2,000 BC, the Neolithic period. In southwest Asia, Neolithic cultures appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the Levant (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) and from there into the east and west. Early Neolithic structures can be found in southeast Anatolia, Syria, and Iraq by 8,000 BC, with food-producing societies first appearing in southeast Europe by 7,000 BC, and central Europe by ca. 5,500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the  Starčevo-Koros (Cris), Linearbandkeramic, and Vinča.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] The people of the Americas and the Pacific remained at the Neolithic level of technology up until the time of European contact, including very small exceptions (a few copper hatchets and spear heads in the Great Lakes region).[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The Neolithic peoples in the Levant, Anatolia, Syria, northern Mesopotamia and central Asia were great builders, utilising mud-brick to construct houses and villages. At Çatalhöyük, houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. In Europe, long houses built from wattle and daub were constructed. Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousand still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built long barrows and chamber tombs for their dead and causewayed camps, henges flint mines and cursus monuments. Early Neolithic water wells from the Linear Pottery culture have been found in central Germany near Leipzig. These constructions are built in timber with complicated woodworking joints at the edges and have been dated between 5,200 and 5,100 BCE.Early Neolithic Water Wells Reveal the World's Oldest Wood Architecture Tegel W, Elburg R, Hakelberg D, Stäuble H, Büntgen U (2012) Early Neolithic Water Wells Reveal the World's Oldest Wood Architecture. PLoS ONE 7(12): e51374. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051374
Megaliths found in Europe and the Mediterranean were also erected in the Neolithic period. These monuments include both megalithic tombs, temples and structures of unknown (possibly religious or astronomical) purpose. The oldest known megalithic temple is Ggantija on Gozo Island.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Neolithic pile dwellings have been excavated in Sweden (Alvastra pile dwelling) and in the circum-Alpine area, with remains being found at the Mondsee and Attersee lakes in Upper Austria. Early archaeologists like Ferdinand Keller thought they formed artificial islands, much like the Scottish Crannogs, but today it is clear that the majority of settlements was located on the shores of lakes and were only inundated later on. Reconstructed pile dwellings are shown in open air museums in Unteruhldingen and Zurich (Pfahlbauland).[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] 
In Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, Neolithic settlements included wattle-and-daub structures with thatched roofs and floors made of logs covered in clay. This is also when the burdei (below-ground) style of house construction was developed, which was still used by Romanians and Ukrainians up until the 20th century.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]   
Neolithic settlements include:
The world's oldest known engineered roadway, the Sweet Track in England, also dates from this time.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), sometimes referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is the United Kingdom government department responsible for developing and executing the British government's public finance policy and economic policy.  The Treasury maintains OSCAR the replacement for COINS Combined Online Information System that contains a detailed analysis of departmental spending under thousands of category headings.http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/opensecrets/2009/09/how_big_is_the_coins_database.html and from which the Whole of Government Accounts are now produced.

The private finance initiative (PFI) is a way of creating "public–private partnerships" (PPPs) by funding public infrastructure projects with private capital. Developed initially by the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom, and used extensively there and in Spain, PFI and its variants have now been adopted in many countries as part of the wider neoliberal programme of privatisation and financialisation driven by an increased need for accountability and efficiency for public spending.[tpl]cite web|url=|author=Barlow, J.

PFI has been controversial in the UK; the National Audit Office felt that it provided good value for money overall.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13962464?story_id=E1_TPJGNQGQ|accessdate=2011-05-09|title=PFI deals in recession: Singing the blues | work = The Economist|date=2011-05-09[/tpl] However more recently the Parliamentary Treasury Select Committee found that ""PFI should be brought on balance sheet. The Treasury should remove any perverse incentives unrelated to value for money by ensuring that PFI is not used to circumvent departmental budget limits. It should also ask the OBR to include PFI liabilities in future assessments of the fiscal rules".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/treasury-committee/news/pfi-report/|accessdate=2011-09-02|title=Committee publishes report on Private Finance Initiative funding | publisher = www.parliament.uk|date=2011-09-02[/tpl]
