[[William L. Holland]]
CATEGORIES: 1907 births, 2008 deaths, Institute directors, University of Canterbury alumni, University of British Columbia faculty, New Zealand academics, People from the Canterbury Region

William Lancelot Holland (28 December 1907 – 8 May 2008)  worked with the Institute of Pacific Relations from 1928 until 1960 as Research Secretary; American IPR Executive Secretary and editor of its periodical, Far Eastern Survey; IPR Secretary-General and editor of its journal, Pacific Affairs. He taught at University of British Columbia from 1961 to 1970. “Obituary,”, Pacific Affairs
Holland, the oldest of four sons, was born in South Malvern, Canterbury, New Zealand and went to Timaru Boys' High School. He graduated from Canterbury College in Christchurch, in 1928. His father was a sheep farmer and railroad worker, and Holland worked on sheep stations to put himself through school. 
At the age of 21 Holland sailed to Kyoto, Japan to assist at the 1932 Institute of Pacific Relations Conference. Edward C. Carter, head of the American branch, invited him to join the Secretariat, and Holland was to work for the IPR until it went out of operation in 1960. In 1934, he took a Masters degree at King’s College, Cambridge University, in economics, studying with John Maynard Keynes among others. In 1944, he became an American citizen in order to accept the position of acting director of the Office of War Information in Chungking, China.
In the early 1950s congressional charges that the IPR was under communist influences, although never substantiated, seriously impaired the ability to operate. Edward Carter left the American IPR, and Holland became Executive Secretary and editor of its journal, Pacific Affairs. The University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada,invited Holland to become the head of the newly created Department of Asian Studies, and to bring Pacific Affairs with him. He joined the faculty in 1961 and helped build UBC into a leading center for research on Asia. He became professor emeritus in 1972, continuing to edit Pacific Affairs until 1978. In 1989 the University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws.
In 1932, in Hong Kong, he married Doreen Patricia McGarry of Auckland, New Zealand. In 1990, following his wife’s death, he moved to Amherst, Massachusetts, to live with his only child, Patricia G. Holland.
Holland died in Amherst, Massachusetts in May 2008.
Holland’s papers are at Columbia University, the University of British Columbia, and the University of Hawai’i. In 2003 he established the William L. Holland Prize for the best article published each year in Pacific Affairs.

Agenda 2000 was an action programme of the European Union whose main objectives were to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and Regional policy, and establish a new financial framework for the years 2000–06 with a view to the then upcoming Eastern Enlargement of the European Union.
Its stated goals were:
1. "to update the European Model of Agriculture"
2. "to narrow the gaps in wealth and economic prospects between regions "
3. "to honour priorities while enjoying only very modest increases in budget
income until 2006"
The reforms were first outlined in the documents with the title "Agenda 2000" published by the Commission in July 1997. Reforms were finally agreed by the 15 EU countries at the European Council meeting in Berlin in March 1999. Detailed legislation was later drafted and agreed to by all of the EU institutions.

The Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was created as a merger of Northern Nigeria Protectorate and Southern Nigeria Protectorate on 1 January 1914, due to growing tension with the German colonies.
As one of the wealthiest British colonies, it was a good candidate for being the first colony to be granted independence.  Nigeria was first given increased autonomy as the Federation of Nigeria on 1 October 1954 and made fully independent in 1960.

[[Enchanted loom]]
CATEGORIES: Brain, Sleep, Metaphors

The enchanted loom is a famous metaphor for the human brain invented by the pioneering neuroscientist Charles S. Sherrington in a passage from his 1942 book Man on his nature, in which he poetically describes his conception of what happens in the cerebral cortex during arousal from sleep:[tpl]Ref label|A|a|none[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|The great topmost sheet of the mass, that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved, becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither. The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning. It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns.[tpl]cite book |last=Sherrington |first=C.S. |title=Man on his nature |year=1942 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=178 |isbn=978-0-8385-7701-1[/tpl][/tpl]
The "loom" he refers to was undoubtedly meant to be a Jacquard loom, used for weaving fabric into complex patterns. The Jacquard loom, invented in 1801, was the most complex mechanical device of the 19th century. It was controlled by a punch card system that was a forerunner of the system used in computers until the 1970s. With as many as thousands of independently movable shuttles, a Jacquard loom in operation must have appeared very impressive. If Sherrington had written a decade later, however, he might perhaps have chosen the flashing lights on the front panel of a computer as his metaphor instead.
According to the neuroscience historian Stanley Finger,[tpl]cite book |title=Minds Behind the Brain |author=Finger, S. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |pages=1 |isbn=978-0-19-508571-6[/tpl] Sherrington probably borrowed the loom metaphor from an earlier writer, the psychologist Fredric Myers, who asked his readers to "picture the human brain as a vast manufactory, in which thousands of looms, of complex and differing patterns, are habitually at work".[tpl]cite journal |title=Multiplex personality |author=Myers, F.W.H. |journal=Proc Soc Psych Res |volume=4 |year=1887 |pages=496–514[/tpl] Perhaps in part because of its slightly cryptic nature, the "enchanted loom" has been an attractive metaphor for many writers about the brain, and has supplied the title for several books, including the following:

John Fancy (9 March 1913 – 16 September 2008) was a British former airman whose tunnelling escapes from various German prisoner of war camps during World War II earned him the nickname The Mole, and inspired the book and film The Great Escape.Obituary, The Daily Telegraph
Fancy was born in 1913 in the vicarage at Lund near Driffield in Yorkshire. He was educated at Hymers College and looked set to follow his father into a career in estate management but joined the RAF in 1935 instead. Although slightly colour blind he was passed fit for aircrew as an air observer and achieved the rank of Warrant Officer.  His service record included delivering Blenheim bombers to Finland and operations over the North Sea including a raid on Stavanger.  His squadron was then moved to operations over Northern Europe in support of the British Expeditionary Force rearguard actions which culminated in Operation Dynamo.  
He was first captured on May 14, 1940 when the Blenheim in which he was serving as air observer/navigator was shot down by German anti-aircraft fire while returning from a raid on Sedan, France.  He was taken to Stalag Luft I (the Germans maintained separate POW camps for aircrew), as prisoner 89 he was one of the first allied airmen to be captured.WWII tunnel digger 'Mole' dies, BBC News, 3 October 2008.  Retrieved on 24 October 2008Tributes paid to wartime 'mole', BBC Devon,  3 October 2008.  Retrieved on 24 October 2008.
In all Fancy escaped from custody some sixteen times, and constructed eight separate tunnels from various camps, using a German-issued steel table knife as his principal tool. The knife became his prized possession after the war. As an escapee he had many adventures, including being captured by an extermination squad and being subjected to three mock executions.
Though he was Britain's most prolific tunnel-diggerWestern Daily Press and once got as far as a boat off the Baltic coast, he was recaptured every time and was finally repatriated in April 1945 when his camp was liberated by the advancing Allied forces. He later observed: "After four years, 10 months and four days I landed back in England after taking off on what should have been a four-hour flight."  He was Mentioned in Despatches for his conduct.[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=37868|startpage=559|date=31 January 1947|accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl]
After the war Fancy established a market garden near Driffield and ran three greengrocery shops in Scarborough. Following the death of his wife in 1983 he retired to Slapton, Devon to be near his daughter.
Fancy published two books about his experiences in the war: Tunnelling to Freedom (Panther, 1957, ASIN B0007JJ9IS)  and Flights of Fancy (Navigator, 1986, ISBN 0-902830-65-1).

Sir Thomas Wode KS (died 31 August 1502) was a British judge.
His early life and career are unknown, leading to him being described as 'perhaps the most obscure chief justice of the Tudor period'. His Inn, through process of elimination, was Middle Temple (as the Middle Temple records for that period are missing, while the records of the other three Inns do not include him), and his first appointment was as a Justice of the Peace for Berkshire in 1478, the same year being returned for Parliament representing Wallingford. He was made a Serjeant-at-law in 1486, and in 1488 a King's Serjeant; it is supposed he then became a member of Serjeant's Inn after this. On 24 November 1495 he was made a Puisne Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and on 28 October 1500 he was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. His presidency of the Court of Common Pleas was short, with Wode dying in office on 31 August 1502. He had lived at Childrey in North Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) and was buried at Reading Abbey in accordance with his will, leaving a gold ring and two books to Thomas Frowyk, who succeeded him as Chief Justice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/94547?&docPos=41&backToResults=list=yes[tpl]![/tpl]group=yes[tpl]![/tpl]feature=yes[tpl]![/tpl]aor=3[tpl]![/tpl]orderfield=alpha |title=Oxford DNB article:Wode, Sir Thomas|accessdate=4 October 2008 |subscription=yes[/tpl]

Arthur Howe Holdsworth (1780–1860) was a Devon merchant named Governor of Dartmouth Castle, a position held by his father Arthur from 1760 to 1777, in 1809. He was elected member of Parliament for Dartmouth in 1802, holding the seat until December 1819, when he vacated it in favour of Charles Milner Ricketts, a cousin of Lord Liverpool. He returned to the seat in 1829, but was defeated by John Seale in 1832, after the Reform Act partially disenfranchised the constituency.
Holdsworth was from a Devon  mercantile and trading family and resided at Widdecombe House and Mount Galpin in Dartmouth located near Kingsbridge within the Stokenham Priory estate, owned by the Holdsworth family for many years.Kingsbridge and Its Surroundings, Sarah Prideaux Fox, G. P. Friend, Plymouth, 1874 He served as the last Governor of Dartmouth.Arthur Howe Holdsworth by William Brockedon, National Portrait Gallery, npg.org.uk
Holdsworth was a well-known politician in Devonshire, his father Arthur having been a prominent shipowner, merchant and member of Parliament.Arthur Holdsworth Conversing with Thomas Taylor and Captain Stancombe by the River Dart, 1757, Arthur Devis, Paul Mellon Collection, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., www.nga.gov The son, Arthur Howe Holdsworth Holdsworth, was an active businessman with interests in shipping and an inventor with many patents to his name, most relating to shipbuilding and boats. He was a shareholder in the Bristol and Exeter Railway and  was a prime force behind Devon's expansive shipping interests.
The Holdsworth family's roots lay in Yorkshire, and a vicar ancestor moved to Devon in 1620. The vicar's son Arthur entered trade and, aided by the Champernowne family,The Champernownes had been a fixture on the West Country mercantile and social scene for generations. Kat Ashley, nee Champernowne, was a close friend and governess to Queen Elizabeth I. Her niece Catherine Champernowne was the mother of Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Humphrey Gilbert. At the heart of the family dynastic influence lay Sir Arthur Champernowne, who served as Vice-Admiral of the West, while residing at Dartington Hall in Devon. began a lucrative trade with Newfoundland. By 1672 he was mayor of Dartmouth and an imposing figure on the local business scene. In the following two centuries the Holdsworth family came to dominate the mercantile and cultural life of Dartmouth. They were leaders in the trade with Newfoundland and with Portugal, where they owned estates. Their interests extended into trade with the Baltic, the West Indies and America.Arthur Howe Holdsworth, 1780-1861,  dartmouth-history.org.uk
"The family continued to prosper," according to David K. Brown in his book The Way of the Ship in the Midst of the Sea, "helped in 1725 by the award of 'The Waters of the Dart' from the Duchy of Cornwall in 1725 which entitled them to levy tolls on all goods landed between Salcombe and Torbay, a rich perquisite which lasted until 1860. The Holdsworths and their relations held most of the important posts in and around Dartmouth: Freemen, Mayors, Governor of the Castle since 1725, Rector of Stokenham and Brixham, etc. The family home was Widdicombe House, near Torcross, built in 1785 and enlarged in 1820. They also owned Brooke Hall, Dartmouth."The Way of the Ship in the Midst of the Sea, David K. Brown, Periscope Publishing Ltd., 2006
At his death in 1860, Holdsworth left an enormous estate.Will of Arthur Howe Holdsworth, CanadaGenWeb.org Following Holdsworth's stinging defeat for his Parliamentary seat in 1832 by Sir John Henry Seale, 1st Baronet, whose family had challenged the Holdsworth family's hold on the Corporation, all the Holdsworth family members left Dartmouth. The acrimony between the Holdsworths and their Seale family adversaries even forced the move of the 1839 marriage between Holdsworth's daughter Catherine Henrietta Elizabeth Holdsworth and civil engineer William Froude from Dartmouth, where the Holdsworths had long worshipped, to the Brixham parish church instead. 
Arthur Howe Holdsworth was married to the former Henrietta Eastabrook. His middle name was a tribute to the British Admiral Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, a family friend who served as one of two members of Parliament from Dartmouth from 1757 to 1782, overlapping the service in Parliament of Arthur Howe (1780–1786). The Holdsworth family later intermarried with other prominent West Country families, including the St. Aubyns of St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall, the Bastard family of Devon (whose members Edmund Bastard, Edmund Pollexfen Bastard and John Bastard sat with him for Dartmouth) and others.

[[Table knife]]
CATEGORIES: Knives, Eating utensils

A table knife is an item of cutlery with a single cutting edge, part of a table setting.  Table knives are typically of moderate sharpness only, designed to cut only prepared and cooked food.  They are usually made of stainless steel and may be ornate, often having handles of bone, wood or (less commonly now) ivory. Before the invention of stainless steel ordinary steel was used. Modern table knives are commonly made of a single piece of stainless steel (example pictured below). A special type of table knife is a fish knife where the blade is pointed and made of silver plate.  
The distinguishing feature of a table knife is a blunt or rounded end.  The origin of this, and thus of the table knife itself, is attributed by tradition to Cardinal Richelieu around 1637, reputedly to cure dinner guests of the unsavoury habit of picking their teeth with their knife-points.[tpl]cite news|last=Long |first=Tony |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/05/dayintech_0513 |title=May 13, 1637: Cardinal Richelieu Makes His Point |publisher=Wired.com |date= 13 May 2008|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]
Later, in 1669, King Louis XIV of France banned pointed knives in the street and at his table,
insisting on blunt tips, in order to reduce violence.[tpl]cite book|last=Patrick|first=Bethanne Kelly|title=An Uncommon History of Common Things|year=2009|publisher=National Geographic|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1-4262-0420-5 |quote=isbn13=978-1-4262-0420-3|author2=John Thompson, Henry Petroski |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bcaXzXPP8ooC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=King+Louis+XIV+banned+pointed+knives&source=bl&ots=V7-A7qxUFY&sig=834rpg_eWmZm_G-sB3HIpbgJdfI&hl=en&ei=eNmBTrvDEaGDsgKqy5jdDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=King%20Louis%20XIV%20banned%20pointed%20knives&f=false |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite journal|author=Emma Hern|author2=Will Glazebrook, Mike Beckett|title=Reducing knife crime|journal=BMJ Editorial|year=2005|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/330/7502/1221.full|doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7502.1221[/tpl]

In any table setting, the knife will typically be the piece to bear the maker's stamp, on the blade.  The English city of Sheffield is noted for its cutlery manufacture and many knives bear the city's name in addition to the maker's.
Most table knives require a fork to stabilise foods during cutting. Rocker knives, however, do not.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IYseAAAACAAJ&dq=0553137530&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zOBSUou_NMGAqQH3y4HYAQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |title=The Source Book for the Disabled: An Illustrated Guide to Easier and More Independent Living for Physically Disabled People, Their Families and Friends |year=1981 |publisher=Bantam Books |location=London |isbn=0553137530 |pages=235–7 |author=Pat Barr... et al.|editor=Glorya Hale |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl]

Sir John Ernley (or Ernle) (1464 – 22 April 1520) was a British justice. He was educated at one of the Inns of Chancery from 1478 to 1480 before being admitted to Gray's Inn. By 1490 he was a particularly conspicuous member of the "Sussex circle" gathered around Edmund Dudley. In his home county of Sussex he maintained a substantial legal practice, serving as feoffee, arbitrator, justice and commissioner, and joining the home assize circuit in 1496 and 1497 as an associate, followed by a position on the county bench in 1498. In the 16th century, he acted as a feoffee for Edmund Dudley, and was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales on 12 July 1507 as a result of his influence with Dudley and, as an extension, Henry VII. He was reappointed when Henry VIII came to power and under him became an important figure in the court. After Sir Robert Rede died in 1519, Ernley was selected to replace him, and was appointed on 27 January of that year. He served for barely a year, dying on 22 April 1520, and was buried in Sidlesham, near Chichester. He left a son and heir, William Erneley, who also served as a Member of Parliament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69362?&docPos=44&backToResults=list=yes[tpl]![/tpl]group=yes[tpl]![/tpl]feature=yes[tpl]![/tpl]aor=3[tpl]![/tpl]orderfield=alpha&_fromAuth=1|title=Oxford DNB article:Ernley, Sir John|accessdate=2008-10-04[/tpl]

[[Air observer]]
CATEGORIES: Military aviation occupations

An air observer is a military aircrew member whose duties are predominantly reconnaissance.  The term originated in the First World War in the British Royal Flying Corps, and was maintained by its successor, the Royal Air Force.  An air observer's brevet was a single wing with an O at the root.
The term is still used in some contexts now, such as police helicopter units.Devon & Cornwall constabulary
The first recorded RAF "kill" of the Second World War, on 20 September 1939, was by air observer Sergeant F Letchford, aboard a Fairey Battle, flown by Flying Officer LH Baker.88 Squadron history, Ministry of Defence
Observers were also issued with weapons, and expected to engage with enemy aircraft in the early days of military aviation.  Over time, the role changed and separate gunnery specialities emerged.  By the Second World War the RAF commonly used the designation "air observer/navigator" in bomber crew.
Air observers were trained at the Air Observer Schools.RAF info

WYLR is a radio station in the Youngstown, Ohio market. Licensed to Hubbard, the station broadcasts an contemporary christian music  CCM  format on 101.9 FM from the  Educational Media Foundation 24-hour national feed (K-LOVE).
The station signed on as a result of a construction permit issued in January 31, 1992 by Columbus atty. Percey Squire and local broadcaster Mr.Frankie 'Lucky" Halfacre who was the first Africian-American DJ in the greater Youngstown area who got his start on WNIO-1540 in the 1960s.
From 1998 until 2001, the station was operated by Jacor Communications and successor Clear Channel Communications via an LMA, making it a part of their extensive Youngstown/New Castle cluster of stations. The call letters were WBTJ, and sported a rhythmic top 40 format as "101.9 The Beat." Then-owner Stop 26/Riverbend took Clear Channel to court, complaining to the FCC that Clear Channel refused to preempt any of their programming upon Stop 26's request.
After settling in court, where Clear Channel paid a $25,000 fine to Stop 26 for unauthorized transfer of control of WBTJ, the "Beat" format was moved to the Sharpsville, PA-licensed 95.9 facility (where it became "Kiss FM" WAKZ), and WNIO's adult standards programming was briefly simulcast until Stop 26 could re-assume control of the station. When that happened, the WRBP call letters, which were used prior to Jacor/Clear Channel's LMA, were revived.
Stop 26/Riverbend declared bankruptcy in 2006, and Bernard Radio purchased almost all of their stations, including WRBP, WASN and WGFT.

CATEGORIES: 14th-century songs, Motets, Medieval music

 ''Sub Arturo plebs – Fons citharizantium – In omnem terram''  is an isorhythmic motet of the second part of the 14th century, written by an English composer known by the name of Johannes Alanus or John Aleyn. It stands in the tradition of the Ars nova, the fourteenth-century school of polyphonic music based in France. It is notable for the historical information it provides about contemporary music life in England, and for its spectacularly sophisticated use of complex rhythmic devices, which mark it as a prime example of the stylistic outgrowth of the Ars nova known today as Ars subtilior.Günther, Ursula: Das Wort-Ton-Problem bei Motetten des späten 14. Jahrhunderts. In: Festschrift Heinrich Besseler zum 60. Geburtstag. Leipzig: Deutscher Verlag für Musik, 1961. 163–178. It has been dated conjecturally to either around 1358, which, within that school of composition, would make its compositional technique exceptionally innovative for its own time, or some time later during the 1370s.

Charles M. Autenrieth (1828–1906) was an American architect whose practice was centered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From 1852 to 1902, he was in partnership with Edward Collins, and thereafter with his son, Charles M. Autenrieth, Jr.
Autenrieth was born in Wurtenburg, Germany, and came to the United States in 1849.  He found positions first with Philadelphia architect Samuel Sloan, and then John McArthur, Jr. In 1852, entered into a partnership with fellow German immigrant Edward Collins (1821-1902).
The architectural firm of Collins & Autenrieth designed buildings for both private individuals and civic institutions. The Lea family served as clients for many commissions. 
Collins & Autenrieth designed the first store for Lit Brothers at 735-39 Market Street (NE corner 8th & Market) in 1893. As the store grew, they expanded it into 731-33 Market (1895), 723-29 Market (1896), and, at the other end of the block, 701-07 Market (1907).
Much of Collins & Autenrieth's work centered upon Philadelphia's German immigrant community.
At least two of Collins & Autenrieth's works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[tpl]NRISref|2010a[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Transports of the United States Navy, World War I transports of the United States, Clyde-built ships, 1910 ships

USS ''Zeelandia'' (ID-2507) was a transport that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
thumb|250px|left|Dutch passenger ship SS Zeelandia at New York City prior to her U.S. Navy service.The passenger ship Zeelandia was constructed in 1910 by A. Stephens and Sons, Ltd., at Glasgow, Scotland, in the United Kingdom. She was operated in transatlantic service by the Royal Dutch Lloyd lines until March 1918, when she was chartered by the U.S. Navy.
The ship was given Id. No. 2507 and placed in commission as USS Zeelandia at New York, New York, on 3 April 1918, Commander Robert Henderson in command.
Assigned to the Newport News Division of the Transport Force, Zeelandia carried troops across the Atlantic Ocean during the remaining months of World War I. She made five round-trip voyages to French ports between commissioning and the armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. During those voyages, she carried a total of 8,349 passengers — mostly troops — to Europe.
Though Zeelandia claimed to have sighted and engaged German U-boats on several occasions during her wartime service, only one encounter was verified as definitely a submarine. That event occurred at dusk on 31 August 1918, when a submarine surfaced to attack the convoy in which she cruised. The attacker, however, could not press home its attack because of zigzag tactics and a moderately strong escort.
Zeelandia remained in U.S. Navy service between 11 November 1918 and 31 July 1919, making seven voyages between Europe and the United States returning American troops home after the war. During those voyages, she repatriated 15,737 American soldiers and carried 3,170 passengers to Europe.
On 31 July 1919, Zeelandia was transferred to the custody of the Commandant, 3rd Naval District for disposal. She was finally decommissioned on 6 October 1919, was struck from the Navy List the same day, and was simultaneously returned to her owner.

An act for the relief and civilization of the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota (51st-1st-Ex.Doc.247), commonly known as the Nelson Act of 1889, was a United States federal law intended to relocate all the Anishinaabe people in Minnesota to the White Earth Indian Reservation in the western part of the state, and to expropriate the vacated reservations for sale to European Americans. [tpl]cite book |last=Conforti |first=Michael |title=Minnesota 1900 |year=1994 |publisher=University of Delaware Press |isbn=978-0-87413-560-2 |pages=302 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PeArSxczlsMC&pg=PA302&lpg=PA302&dq=%22Nelson+Act++of+1889%22&source=web&ots=ghAmThaLZq&sig=N-4WMZxzyYdBH9d41hIwRhdow6c&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result[/tpl]
Approved by Congress on January 14, 1889, the Nelson Act was the equivalent for reservations in Minnesota to the Dawes Act of 1887, which had mandated allotting communal Indian lands to individual households in Indian Country, and selling the surplus. The goal of the Nelson Act was to consolidate Native Americans within the state of Minnesota on a western reservation, and, secondly, to encourage allotment of communal lands to individual households in order to encourage subsistence farming and assimilation.  It reflected continuing tensions between whites and American Indians in the state. Especially after the Dakota Conflict of 1862, many Minnesota white residents were eager to consolidate the reservations, reduce the amount of land controlled by Indians and make the surplus available for sale and settlement by European Americans. 
Minnesota congressmen Knute Nelson pushed for the allotment of Ojibwe lands in Northern Minnesota and sale of "surplus" to non-Natives. He and others intended to force the Ojibwe to relinquish most of their reservation lands.  The intention was to relocate the peoples to the westernmost White Earth Reservation.  All would receive individual allotments, with the remainder to be available for sale to European Americans.  These actions were illegal and violated the treaties which the US had made with the tribes, but the government proceeded anyway.  The Red Lake Band of Chippewa were able to keep the southern portion of their Reservation adjacent to Red Lake.

[[Michael Tritter]]
CATEGORIES: House (TV series) characters, Fictional police detectives

Detective Michael Tritter is a recurring fictional character in the medical drama series House, portrayed by David Morse.  He is the main antagonist of the third season, which ran between 2006 and 2007.  Tritter is a police detective, who tries to get Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) to apologize for leaving him in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum.  After House refuses to apologize, Tritter researches House's background and discovers the doctor's Vicodin addiction.  Tritter turns people close to House against him and forces House to go to rehab.  When the case ultimately comes to court, the judge sentences House to one night in jail, for contempt of court, and finishing his rehabilitation, telling Tritter that she believes House is not the drug addict he tried to make him out to be.
The character was created as somebody who could go "toe-to-toe" with House.  Morse, who had never seen the show before, was unsure if he could portray the character and was not impressed after familiarizing himself with the show.  The excited reaction of his friends to the acting opportunity finally convinced him to take the role.  Initial critical responses to the character were mostly positive, but critics later felt that the seven-episode Tritter story arc became "boring"; however, Morse was praised for his portrayal and gained an Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series Emmy Award nomination for his appearance in the episode "Finding Judas".  Morse stated in a 2006 TV Guide interview that, although he had discussed it with writers of the show, bringing the character back on the show would be "practically impossible".

The Ark is designed to preserve at-risk foods that are sustainably produced, unique in taste, and part of a distinct ecoregion. Contrary to the most literal definition of plant and animal conservation, the Ark of Taste aims to maintain edibles in its purview by actively encouraging their cultivation for consumption.NYT, Apr. 2008 By doing so, Slow Food hopes to promote the growing and eating of foods which are sustainable and preserve biodiversity in the human food chain.
Foods included in the list are intended to be "culturally or historically linked to a specific region, locality, ethnicity or traditional production practice",Ark of Taste, slowfoodusa.org in addition to being rare. Which foods meet these criteria is decided by an adjudicating committee made up of members of the Slow Food non-profit organization; all candidates go through a formal nomination process which includes tastings and identification of producers within the region.Washington Post, Nov. 2004
Since the foundation of the Ark in 1996, 800 products from over 50 countries have been included. The list includes not only prepared foods and food products, but a great many livestock breeds as well as vegetable and fruit cultivars. All foods in the catalogue are accompanied by a list of resources for those wishing to grow or buy them.

While never topping the charts, the song has persisted over the years to become a part of the South Carolina and North Carolina culture and remains a radio and live performance favorite. The song was later recorded by other artists,[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] although not with the success of the original.  The song also inspired the book Carolina Girls (ISBN 0-9712521-7-3) by Steven Brown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicksprings.com/carolinagirls.htm |title=Chick Springs Publishing |publisher=Chicksprings.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl]
In an interview with Blues Critic, Danny Woods of Chairman of the Board was asked if "Carolina girls really are the best" and explains:  "You know when I first came here (The Carolinas) there was no style. You know you had the New York girls, California girls and they all got the attention. Even songs about them. And that just made Carolina girls feel like nothing but there's quite a difference between Carolina girls now and then. Their self esteem just magnified after that song."[tpl]cite web|url=http://bluescritic.com/chairmenoftheboardinterview.htm |title=CD Store Page 1 |publisher=Bluescritic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl] 
Fellow Chairman Ken Knox followed up:
 Girls became prideful. High schools and colleges use that song. Marching bands play "Carolina Girls". It's on T-shirts and we're glad about that. It's the all time biggest Carolina beach song now.

Irving Nattrass (born 20 December 1952) was a midfielder for Newcastle and Middlesbrough
Born in Fishburn, England Nattrass attended Ferryhill Grammar School and Signed with Newcastle at age 16 on an apprenticeship. 
As a youth player Irving lacked confidence and made slow progress within the club, even going so far as to look for employment elsewhere as a mechanic, however he soon found his stride and went on to sign professionally for the club in July 1970 aged 17. A year later Irving went on to make his debut against Derby.
The then Newcastle manager Joe Harvey once commented "Nattrass is my Paul Madeley and I can't pay him a bigger compliment than that". Paul Madeley was a Leeds and England player who was dubbed the "Rolls Royce" of footballers.
Hampered by injuries and disagreements with the Newcastle board he eventually moved to Middlesbrough for the sum of £375,000.  Nattrass made his league debut for them against Arsenal on 15 September 1979.
Nattrass is now a successful businessman and keen golfer.

He is also remembered for his innovation, being the first sidecar competitor to use a dustbin fairing, rear suspension and the first to adopt the kneeling riding position.http://www.motopaedia.com/Pilots/eric_oliver.htm 
He was also an accomplished solo racer and continued to ride a 350 Grand Prix bike while racing a sidecar.
Oliver made a surprising appearance in the 1958 Isle of Man Sidecar TT race on a standard Norton Dominator 88 with a Watsonian "Monza" road sidecar with Mrs Pat Wise in the sidecar, finishing tenth ahead of many specialised race machines. Oliver's last TT appearance was in the 1960 with passenger Stan Dibben but they had a bad crash in practice with Oliver breaking his back in two places and Dibben was nearly decapitated. Both men decided to retire from racing after this.http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=814&filter=O

[[T helper 3 cell]]

CATEGORIES: T cells

TH3 cells are involved in mucosal immunity and protecting mucosal surfaces in the gut from nonpathogenic non-self antigens. They mediate this non-inflammatory environment by secreting TGF-beta and IL-10. TGF-beta promotes the class switch to low concentrations of IgA which is noninflammatory. IgA does not usually activate the complement system and is not involved with phagocytosis. TH3 inhibits TH1 and TH2 cells. 
T helper 3 cell (Th3) have different cytokine requirements for their growth from CD25+ CD4+ Treg cells. The survival of CD25+ CD4+ Treg cells is dependent upon interleukin 2 (IL-2),[tpl]cite journal|last=Sakaguchi|first=S|year=2006|title=Foxp3+ CD25+ CD4+ natural regulatory T cells in dominant self-tolerance and autoimmune disease|journal=Immunol Rev|volume=212|pages=8–27|doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2006.00427.x|pmid=16903903|last2=Ono|first2=M|last3=Setoguchi|first3=R|last4=Yagi|first4=H|last5=Hori|first5=S|last6=Fehervari|first6=Z|last7=Shimizu|first7=J|last8=Takahashi|first8=T|last9=Nomura|first9=T|display-authors=9[/tpl] while in vitro differentiation of Th3 cells is enhanced by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), IL-4, and IL-10.
Findings suggest that Th3 cells are a different linage from naturally arising CD25+ CD4+ Treg cells, but it is still unclear whether Th3 cells are the same as induced Treg cells because of the lack of a specific marker for Th3 cells. It was previously shown that TGF-β was produced by intestinal dendritic cells,[tpl]cite journal|last=Johansson|first=C|year=2005|title=Phenotype and function of intestinal dendritic cells|journal=Semin Immunol|volume=17|pages=284–294|doi=10.1016/j.smim.2005.05.010|pmid=15978836|last2=Kelsall|first2=BL|issue=4[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Iwasaki|first=A|year=2007|title=Mucosal dendritic cells|journal=Annu Rev Immunol|volume=25|pages=381–418|doi=10.1146/annurev.immunol.25.022106.141634|pmid=17378762[/tpl] which has been considered to be the source of cytokines for the induction of Th3 cells in the intestine. Additionally, since TGF-β production was induced by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which is constitutively expressed on naturally arising Treg cells,[tpl]cite journal|last=Chen|first=W|year=2003|title=Conversion of Peripheral CD4+CD25− Naive T Cells to CD4+CD25+ Regulatory T Cells by TGF-β Induction of Transcription Factor Foxp3|journal=J Exp Med|volume=198|pages=1875–1886|doi=10.1084/jem.20030152|pmid=14676299|last2=Jin|first2=W|last3=Hardegen|first3=N|last4=Lei|first4=KJ|last5=Li|first5=L|last6=Marinos|first6=N|last7=McGrady|first7=G|last8=Wahl|first8=SM|issue=12|pmc=2194145[/tpl] it is possible that TGF-β production from Treg cells through CTLA-4–mediated signaling may stimulate the differentiation of both induced Treg cells and Th3 cells.

[[Hurricane Norbert (2008)]]
CATEGORIES: 2008 Pacific hurricane season, Category 4 Pacific hurricanes, Pacific hurricanes in Mexico, Hurricanes and tropical depressions of the Gulf of California

Hurricane Norbert is tied with Hurricane Jimena as the strongest tropical cyclone strike the west coast of Baja California Sur in recorded history. The fifteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and second major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Norbert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave south of Acapulco on October 3. Strong wind shear initially prevented much development, but the cyclone encountered a more favorable environment as it moved westward. On October 5, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norbert, and the system intensified further to attain hurricane intensity by October 6. After undergoing a period of rapid deepening, Norbert reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, with maximum sustained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg). As the cyclone rounded the western periphery of a subtropical ridge over Mexico, it began an eyewall replacement cycle which led to steady weakening. Completing this cycle and briefly reintensifying into a major hurricane, a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, Norbert moved ashore Baja California Sur as a Category 2 hurricane late on October 11. After a second landfall at a weaker intensity the following day, the system quickly weakened over land and dissipated that afternoon.
In preparation for the cyclone, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for coastal regions of the Baja California Peninsula. Residents living in low-lying areas and flood-prone regions were advised to evacuate, and beach-goers were warned to stay out of the water. Upon landfall, the hurricane produced waves in excess of [tpl]convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. Though the strongest winds observed were less than hurricane intensity, heavy rainfall as a result of Norbert lead to substantial damage. In Baja California Sur, roughly 5,000 homes sustained major damage; the heaviest-impacted municipality, Comondú, reported 16,000 homes affected. Thousands of people were forced into shelters, and many trees were blown down by strong winds. A total of 25 fatalities occurred in Sonora, 5 of which occurred in Álamos, where excessive rainfall caused a majority of the town to become flooded; homes were submerged to their roofs and many trees were downed. The hurricane severely impacted the fishing industry in Sinaloa, while thousands of residents were left homeless. In the United States, Norbert produced minimal rainfall. In the aftermath of the storm, many towns and municipalities were declared disaster areas. Overall, Norbert inflicted $98.5 million (2008 USD) in damage.

[[My Story (Julie Couillard book)]]
CATEGORIES: 2008 books, Canadian autobiographies, McClelland & Stewart books

My Story (or Mon histoire) is a tell-all memoir by Canadian Julie Couillard. It was first written in French, then during summer 2008, translated into English. Both versions were published across Canada in October 2008.
Couillard first appeared in the national media when she dated the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Bernier. The Bernier-Couillard Affair erupted in May 2008 over confidential, NATO-related documents left at Couillard's house. Media coverage, and Bernier's reaction, left Couillard feeling victimized. To help dispel rumours regarding her life and her role with Bernier, Couillard signed a book deal.
In her book, she recounts her early years, describes her relationship with Bernier, and reveals his confidential opinions.
Intended to be released on October 14, 2008, the book's release date was moved forward when that same day was selected for the Canadian federal election. Bernier dismissed the embarrassing allegations against him in her book as ridiculous.  Though My Story was released eight days prior to the election, Bernier nonetheless was re-elected in his district of Beauce. The English version peaked at #6 on La Presse's bestseller list while the French version reached #5. Critics found Couillard's story self-righteous and sometimes conveniently vague, but noted that it provided a unique view into the government's inner circle.

The twenty-one delegates could not reconcile their differences, despite the need to be unified before the Allies in requesting aid.

Ronald Oldham Doig (10 July 1909 – 17 September 1932) was an Australian sportsman who played Australian rules football for South Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and first-class cricket with Western Australia.
A member of the famous Doig family of Fremantle, Ron was a first cousin of George Doig. He made his debut for South Fremantle at the age of just 17 in 1927 and by 1930 was representing Western Australia at interstate football. He was captain of South Fremantle in 1931 and captain-coach in 1932.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32535988 |title=Death of R O Doig. An Irreparable Loss |newspaper=The West Australian |location=Perth, WA |date=20 September 1932 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
On the cricket field, Doig was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and right-handed batsman. He made three first-class cricket appearances for Western Australia, the first of which came in 1926/27 against South Australia. Doig didn't bowl and instead played as a top order batsman, making scores of eight and five. 
[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/12/12203.html|title=Western Australia v South Australia 1926/27| publisher=CricketArchive[/tpl]
He had to wait until 1931 to play again at first-class level, with his opportunity coming when South Africa toured. Batting at four, he failed to impress with the bat but took what would be the only wicket of his career, bowling opener Herbie Taylor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14098.html|title=Western Australia v South Africans 1931/32| publisher=CricketArchive[/tpl] When South Africa returned to Perth five months later, Doig made his only other first-class appearance but didn't have an impact on the game.
In the finals of the 1932 WAFL season, Doig, who was now captain-coach of South Fremantle, was seriously injured in a match against East Perth. He died from his injuries.

Oral zinc in macular degenerations.  Arch Ophthalmol 106:192-198, 1988
He also found that the eye's pigmented retina, a type of covering or epithelial tissue, could produce some types of collagen. His findings came when it was thought that epithelial tissues either could not (or did not) produce collagen. His new observations opened a new field of investigation of the collagen and related structural molecules in the eye and other tissues.D A Newsome, T F Linsenmayer, and R L Trelstad, Vitreous body collagen.

Lolita is a novel by Vladimir Nabokov, written in English and published in 1955 in Paris and 1958 in New York. It was later translated by its Russian-native author into Russian. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator, a 37-38 year old literature professor Humbert Humbert, is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather. "Lolita" is his private nickname for Dolores.
After its publication, Lolita attained a classic status, becoming one of the best-known and most controversial examples of 20th century literature. The name "Lolita" has entered pop culture to describe a sexually precocious girl. The novel was adapted to film by Stanley Kubrick in 1962, and again in 1997 by Adrian Lyne. It has also been adapted several times for stage and has been the subject of two operas, two ballets, and an acclaimed but failed Broadway musical.
Lolita is included on Time's List of the 100 Best Novels in English-language from 1923 to 2005. It is fourth on the Modern Library's 1998 list of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th century. It was also included in The 100 Best Books of All Time, compiled in 2002 by the Norwegian Book Club.

After RCA was acquired by General Electric in 1986, GE sold the RCA consumer electronics line to Thomson SA which continued the Dimensia line. They are significant for their wide array of advanced features and for being the first television receiver systems to feature a built in computer. In 1985 they released the Digital Command Component System, a fully integrated audio system that permitted the full functionality of Dimensia audio components without a Dimensia monitor. The name "Dimensia" actually dates back to the early 1970s when RCA used the term for an enhanced spatial stereo effect which they called "Dimensia IV".http://books.google.com/books?id=Rw8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32&dq=rca+dimensia&ei=8oeAS4r7HpT0ygSutb3BCw&cd=2#v=onepage&q=rca%20dimensia&f=false The tagline for the Dimensia was The Next Dimension in Sight and Sound.

Cider or cyder ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|d|ər[/tpl] [tpl]respell|SY|dər[/tpl]) is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from apple juice . Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% ABV to 8.5% or more in traditional English ciders. In some regions, cider may be called "apple wine".[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=sTsC65kCJbUC&pg=PA169 |title=The Prokaryotes: Proteobacteria: alpha and beta subclasses |page=169|author=Martin Dworkin, Stanley Falkow|publisher=Springer|year= 2006|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl]
In the United States and some parts of Canada, the alcoholic beverage discussed in this article is commonly known as "hard cider", while simply "cider" often refers to non-alcoholic unfiltered apple juice. The addition of sugar or extra fruit before a second fermentation increases the alcoholic content of the resulting beverage. An alcoholic apple beverage with higher alcohol content (>10%) is an "apple wine".
The juice of any variety of apple can be used in cider making but particular cultivars are grown for cider making are known as cider apples.[tpl]cite web|title=The Science of Cidermaking Part 1 - Introduction|url=http://cider.org.uk/part1.htm|first=Andrew|last=Lea|accessdate=2 November 2011[/tpl] Cider is popular in the United Kingdom, especially in the West Midlands, South West England and East Anglia.

The beverage is also popular and traditional in some European countries such as Ireland and the French regions of Brittany (chistr) and Normandy (cidre); In Spain it is especially popular in the Principality of Asturias (sidra) although it can also be found in the Basque Country (sagardo) and Galicia (sidra); Germany is another country where cider is drunk, above all in Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse (Frankfurt am Main).
In Poland, which is the largest producer of apples in Europe, cider (Cydr, or Jabłecznik) is just recently gaining in popularity. High quality Polish apple concentrate is commonly used for English, Swedish, and Irish cider manufacturing.
Argentina is also a cider-producing and -drinking country, especially the provinces of Río Negro and Mendoza. Australia also produces cider, particularly on the island of Tasmania, which has a strong apple-growing tradition.
A similar product made from pears is called perry but sometimes (incorrectly) called Pear Cider in the marketing of some producers' products.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/news.ma/article/60535?N=598259&PagingData=Po_0~Ps_10~Psd_Asc | date=2008-04-24 | author=Huddleston, Nigel | accessdate=1 May 2009 |title=Pear Perception | publisher=Morning Advertiser[/tpl]

[[USS Zafiro (1884)]]

CATEGORIES: Colliers of the United States Navy, Aberdeen-built ships, 1884 ships, Spanish–American War auxiliary ships of the United States

USS ''Zafiro'' was a collier that served in the United States Navy from 1898 until 1904.
Zafiro was constructed in 1884 in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by Hall, Russell & Company at Aberdeen, Scotland. Admiral George Dewey purchased her for the U.S. Navy at Hong Kong, China on 9 April 1898 just before his Asiatic Squadron sailed for the Philippine Islands at the beginning of the Spanish-American War.
Though the Secretary of the Navy's Report for 1900 indicates that Zafiro was placed in commission on 10 April 1898, her role as a commissioned ship must have been unique indeed for her complement showed only one U.S. Navy man, her commanding officer, aboard. Her status in the Navy from 1898-1900 is further complicated by the fact that there are no deck logs extant for her during the period; her first log begins on 20 September 1900. Finally, after her service in the Spanish-American War, which ended in August 1898, she had no naval complement on board until Ensign L. A. Gotten reported on board to assume command on 10 May 1900. Thus, the date upon which she was placed in commission cannot be established with any precision.
In any event, Zafiro departed Hong Kong with Dewey's squadron in April 1898 and served with it as a collier and supply ship during the Battle of Manila Bay and the ensuing Philippines campaign. The lack of documents covering her activities in 1898 and the first half of 1899 precludes any detailed narrative for that period. Presumably, she plied the waters of the Philippine Islands carrying troops, supplies, and dispatches between points in the archipelago. Based at Cavite on Luzon, she is known to have performed such missions during the period from July 1899-June 1904. Those movements—in support of the United States Army's suppression of the Philippine insurrection and campaigns against the Moslem Moro tribesmen—took her to a host of exotic places, and the length and breadth of the islands.
On 10 June 1904, Zafiro was placed out of commission at Cavite. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 15 January 1906, and on 21 October 1910 she was sold to Mr. J. W. Zeeve of Seattle, Washington.

"Skunk" is a malodorant, non-lethal weapon used for crowd control by the Israeli Defense Forces. Deriving its name from the animal of the same name, "Skunk" is dispersed as a form of mist, fired from a water cannon, which leaves a terrible odor of rot or sewage on whatever it touches. It does not wash off easily and is said to linger on clothes for up to five years."Israel develops 'skunk bomb' for riot control situations", Haaretz, 18/9/2004 First attempts at developing a scent-based form of crowd control began in Israel in 2004; Skunk was first used for crowd control in September 2008.[tpl]cite web|title=Israel Unleashes First ‘Skunk Bomb’|url=http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/09/skunk-attack/|publisher=2014 Condé Nast.|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] 
According to David Ben Harosh, head of technological development for the Israeli police, the recipe is based entirely on natural organic ingredients, including yeast and baking powder, does not include any harmful materials, and may even be ingested without causing harm. The inventors plan to market Skunk to other forces worldwide. The development of Skunk followed numerous accusations against Israeli forces that they often employ  disproportionate force in clashes with Palestinian protestors (e.g. using rubber bullets or tear gas), which has led them to seek new, non-lethal but effective methods of crowd control.

[[Alabama State Bar]]
CATEGORIES: American state bar associations, Government of Alabama, 1923 establishments in Alabama, Organizations established in 1923

The Alabama State Bar is the integrated (mandatory) bar association of the U.S. state of Alabama.
The Alabama State Bar was established in 1923 and is governed by the 1975 Alabama Code, Section 34 Chapter 3.
It is the "licensing and regulatory agency for attorneys in the State of Alabama, subject to Rules of the Alabama Supreme Court" and "has jurisdiction over the conduct of all attorneys and is charged with stimulating interest in improving the administration of justice." The Bar also administers the state bar examination for those seeking to be admitted to the Bar in Alabama. 
The governing body of the State Bar is a Board of Commissioners. The Board is composed of at least one elected representative from each of Alabama's 41 judicial circuits. One additional Commissioner is elected for each 300 members of the State Bar in a circuit "who maintain their principal office in the circuit as of March of each year, subject to the requirement that no circuit is entitled to more than ten Commissioners."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.alabar.org/about/ | title=About |publisher = Alabama State Bar | accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl]
The Alabama State Bar is dedicated to promoting the professional responsibility and competence of its members, improving the administration of justice and increasing the public understanding of and respect for the law. 
The values that guide the State Bar are:  Trust, Integrity and Service. The ASB has long served a dual role as an advocate for the profession and for the public.  Often it is difficult to separate these two responsibilities, but during the last few decades with the growing complexity of society and our legal system, the ASB's public role has gained both emphasis and breadth.
Since its creation as an integrated bar association, the ASB has initiated programs addressing a wide range of public concerns; from merit selection of judges to securing adequate funding for representing indigent defendants; from ensuring that non-lawyers sit on disciplinary panels to encouraging the use of mediation as an alternative method of dispute resolution. State Bar positions play an influential role in determining public and social policy in state and national forums.
The Alabama State Bar is composed principally of practicing attorneys, judges, law teachers, and non-practicing lawyers who are business executives, government officials, court administrators and so forth.  It represents practitioners in specialized areas of law, as well as affiliated, law-related organizations and groups with special interests or needs.
The state bar serves as the voice of the legal practitioner in Alabama. It proposes model rules of professional responsibility (which govern the daily business and ethical practice of lawyers) for adoption by the supreme court.

CATEGORIES: First Nations governments in Alberta, Cree governments

Ermineskin Cree Nation, also known as the Ermineskin Tribe,Indian and Northern Affairs Canada "First Nation Detail" is a band government in Alberta, Canada, a western branch of the large Cree Nation, and a Treaty 6 nation.
As of 2008, there are 3,758 registered Ermineskin Cree, of which 2,606 were living on reserve.Ermineskin Tribe Population table at Indian and Northern Affairs Canada
The Ermineskin Cree Nations two reserves (around Maskwacis, Alberta) total about 22,512 hectares and lived in an area around Pigeon Lake and the Bear Hills (known in Cree as Maskwacheesihkare). Therefore they were called Maskwa Wachi-is Ininiwak, Maskwacheesihk Wiyiniwak or Amiskwacīwiyiniwak, meaning Bear Hills Cree. While the Ermineskin traditional territory includes the reserve lands, the reserve was formally established in 1885. The land houses substantial oil and gas deposits, agricultural land, and waterfront access to Pigeon Lake. The Canadian Pacific railway line runs through the reserve.
The First Nation took its name from Ermineskin (‘One with the skin like an ermine’,clue to his Métis descent, as the ermine fur is white in winter and brown in summer - as well as the skin of a Métis Sehkosowayanew, Sikosew Inew, also known as Baptiste Piche), Chief of the Bear Hills Cree. He was the son of Peechee (Pesew- ‘Mountain Lion’, also known as Louis Piche), Chief of the Asini Wachi Nehiyawak (Cree groups of the Rocky/Mountain Cree) and later head chief of the 'Rocky/Mountain Cree' (Asini Wachi Wi Iniwak or Asinīskāwiyiniwak)build up Asini Wachi Nehiyawak (Rocky Cree groups) and Asini Pwat-sak (Ye Xa Yabine or Hebina Assiniboine, Rocky Assiniboine groups) groups and also brother-in-law of Pitikwahanapiwiyin (′Poundmaker′), Chief of the River Cree (Sipi Wi Iniwak or Sīpīwininiwak). Ermineskin was the older brother of the well-known Keskayiwew (Kiskiyew, Kiskiyo - Bobtail, also known as Alexis Piche), who became Chief of the Bear Hills Cree after the death of Ermineskin and was elected instead of Maskepetoon ('Broken Arm') to the chieftainship of the Rocky Cree (Asini Wachi Wi Iniwak or Asinīskāwiyiniwak) and became later head chief of the Western Cree (‘Pakisimotan Wi Iniwak’) and soon after head chief of all the groups of the Upstream People (Natimiw Iyiniwak or Natimiyininiwak).

The third USS ''Yuma'' (YTM-748) was a medium harbor tug that served in the United States Navy from 1964 to 1976.
Yuma was built at San Diego, California, by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), for the United States Army, which took delivery of her in 1954, and designated her "large tug" LT-2078. The U.S. Navy acquired LT-2078 from the Army in September 1964. The Navy classified her as a medium harbor tug, designated her YTM-748, and commissioned her as USS Yuma.
Yuma was assigned to the 12th Naval District and served as a harbor tug at San Francisco, California, until placed out of service in August 1976. She was then assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet and berthed at Bremerton, Washington. She was sold for scrapping on 17 March 1987.
Shipbuildinghistory.com: National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), San Diego CA claims that Yuma "later" served under the name Delaware and "now' is named Mobile Point, but no information is available with which to explain at what point in her life and under what circumstances this happened, or to explain the discrepancy between this assertion and the Naval Vessel Register report that the tug was sold for scrapping in 1987.Naval Vessel register YUMA (YTM 748) (ex-LT-2078) Medium Harbor Tug (S-P) She may have been sold for scrapping, but then retained in commercial service instead of being scrapped.

CATEGORIES: Sculptures, Olmec art, Indigenous sculpture of the Americas

The Wrestler is an ancient basalt statuette that is one of the most important sculptures of the Olmec culture. The near life-size figure has been praised not only for its realism and sense of energy, but also for its aesthetic qualities.Castro-Leal.  Since 1964, the sculpture has been part of the collection of the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City.  
This [tpl]convert|66|cm|adj=on[/tpl]-high Mesoamerican statuette was discovered in 1933 by a farmer in Arroyo Sonso, in the Mexican state of Veracruz near the Rio Uxpanapa and not far from its confluence with the Coatzacoalcos River, an area now known as Antonio Plaza.Williams & Heizer, p. 23.  The area also is known as Santa Maria Uxpanapa.

Another of his achievements was convincing the Archbishop of Manila and the government to establish what later became the Manila's Monte de Piedad Savings and Mortgage Bank, with the intent of providing a savings bank for Manila’s poor which would charge moderate interest rates.
In 1859, having been assigned as administrator of San Lazaro Hospital for lepers, Fr. Huerta worked hard to have the hospital reconstructed instead of being closed for being run down.
In his search through financial documents during this effort, he discovered the existence of a previously forgotten fund by General Francisco Carriedo y Peredo for the creation of the first water system in Manila.  Fr. Huerta pursued this project as well, and as a result the water system, with 153 hydrants, was inaugurated on August 23, 1882.

Willey was born in Leeds in 1868 and became one of the most successful solicitors in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He married Maud Evelyn Ellicott in 1894. He entered politics, serving on Leeds City Council.

The horse duly won, and the bookmakers reputedly paid out £190,000 to the people of Leeds.
Willey was not very active in Parliament owing to his commitments as a solicitor, although he intended to increase his Parliamentary work in the near future, and had taken a particular interest in the Criminal Justice Bill during his first session as an MP. He intended to make his maiden speech during the debate on the bill, but it was delayed.
On the morning of Sunday, 1 July 1923, Willey prepared to go to church with his wife Maud. It was the anniversary of the death of his son Tom, killed at the age of 18 at the Battle of the Somme exactly seven years previously.
Willey was taken by a sudden seizure, and never regained consciousness. He died early the following morning, aged 54.The Times, 3 July 1923

[[Paula Underwood]]

CATEGORIES: Iroquois people, Oral historians, 1932 births, 2000 deaths

Paula Underwood (1932–2000) was an Iroquois oral historian. Paula Underwood was a lineal descendant of Tsilikomah, an Oneida (Iroquois) healer in Cascaskia on the Shenango River ca. 1800, who took up responsibility for a vast Oral Tradition and Learning Way from an Erie/Oneida Keeper of the Old Things who was her patient. This tradition was handed down in her family and designed to be shared with "all Earth's children with Listening Ears."
Paula Underwood was the Native American author of several award-winning books and contributor to numerous publications. Paula focused on creative change through the application of an ancient Native American methodology for learning, organization, and health. A speaker, lecturer, and teacher, Paula was also the Founder and Director of The LearningWay company, and developer of a nationwide educational program -The Past is Prologue - used by learning organizations from elementary levels through graduate classes, in corporations, and organizational training. The educational program based on her work has been declared "Exemplary" by the U.S. Department of Education. Her first book, Who Speaks for Wolf, has won four awards, including the Thomas Jefferson Cup for quality writing. It has been called "the best book I know of on systems thinking." Paula was consistently praised for her ability to apply Ancient and enduring American Indian Wisdom to the apparent chaos of rapid change.
She is known for "learning stories" or "The Learning Way."UCART at Indiana University South BendNative American authors site
 
 The Walking People: A Native American Oral History
 
"This story has its beginnings on a day long ago when Earth rolled and heaved, and rocks fell like rain..."
Thus began the epic journey of The Walking People—a journey which, over 10,000 years, would span continents and allow a leaderless, traditionless group of people to gather the knowledge and wisdom to prosper as a Whole People.
The Walking People traces the threads of connection from ancient Native American thinking toward the thinking that underlies many of our present political structures.
Now, the Walking People have reached our own time—a time when we begin to learn that wisdom may have greater value than success, that individuals need respect in their communities, that spirit may mean more than just determination, that no one single view of history can be fully accurate.
This is a history told by the people themselves and passed down from generation to generation, "that the children's children may yet learn."
Published in cooperation with the Institute of Noetic Sciences
  
Who Speaks for Wolf? A Native American Learning Story
 
Who Speaks for Wolf is a story of one People's struggle to live as they learned valuable lessons from nature, from life, and from within themselves.
Deceptively simple, this story can be read on multiple levels of understanding. Each re-reading may raise different questions or reveal new meanings. Winner of a major children's book award in 1984, it has also been used during corporate training sessions and is read in classrooms from kindergarten to college levels.
Beautifully presented in full color with Frank Howell's original paintings and drawings, this book is for anyone of any age who might be willing to ask the ancient question: "Who Speaks for Wolf?"

[[Powerman (comics)]]
CATEGORIES: British comics titles, Defunct British comics, Eclipse Comics superheroes, Fictional Nigerian people

Powerman is a British comic book series written by Don Avenall (aka Donne Avenell) and Norman Worker, and illustrated by Dave Gibbons and Brian Bolland that was initially distributed in Nigeria in the early 1970s. The series starred a superhero named Powerman. When the comics were re-published in the United Kingdom the character's name became Powerbolt.
Gibbons said that an executive from a Nigerian advertising agency approached Bardon Press Features to discuss the idea of making a series with a black superhero; the man and his wife saw that in Nigeria, the comics available were imported and had White protagonists. Gibbons designed the character and the series logo and worked chores with Bolland. Gibbons said that he published one 14-page issue per month, which was published every two weeks (fourteen days and nights). Gibbons said that he remembered asking why Africans did not work on the strips and hearing that the African artists would likely emerge once comics become popular in Africa. Gibbons also recalls difficulty adjusting to writing for a Nigerian culture; for instance, the management told him that a fat stomach indicated "success and power" instead of "gluttony or greed" and that having Powerman "always get off with the girls" was not considered sexist. Each panel had a number to indicate the flow of the story.Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. (Foreword: Dave Gibbons). The Essential Guide to World Comics. Collins and Brown. 2005. 298-299.
Without the permission of the original publishers, the comic was reprinted in South Africa. The Comics Journal accused the creators of Powerman of supporting the Apartheid since the characters were mostly Black. One white character, a blond property developer, was named Boss Blitzer. The character, described by Gibbons as "dishonest," faces defeat at the hands of Powerman.
In 1988, Eclipse Comics republished the series in Power Comics but changed Powerman's name to Powerbolt. Powerman, who had a lot of strength and could fly, appeared in stories rendered in a simple style reminiscent of Fawcett Comics's Golden Age Captain Marvel. His only apparent weakness was snakebite.Index to Comic Art Collection: "Nigel" to "Night Out"
The Powerman anthologies also included a series called Jango, which starred a Black sheriff.

USS ''Yo Ho'' (SP-463) was an armed motorboat that served in the United States Navy as a patrol vessel from 1917 to 1919.
Yo Ho was built in 1910 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Marine Construction Company. The U.S. Navy acquired her for World War I service from H. D. Bacon, of Bath, designated her SP-463, armed her, and commissioned her on 12 May 1917 as USS Yo Ho, Boatswain T. H. Barber, USNRF, in command.
Operating in an unattached status from the 2nd Naval District, Yo Ho served through the armistice which ended the war on 11 November 1918.
Yo Ho was sold for scrap on 2 June 1919 to G. F. Blackburn of New York, New York. Her voyage to the scrapyard was eventful. On 14 June 1919, she was tied to the patrol boat USS Patrol No. 7 (SP-31) and along with Patrol No. 7 under tow by the submarine chaser USS SC-241 when Patrol No. 7 sank between Scituate, Massachusetts, and Minot's Ledge, about 15 nautical miles (28 kilometers) southeast of the Boston Light Vessel. Yo Ho apparently remained afloat despite this mishap and continued her voyage to the scrapyard.

[[Union of Valencia]]
CATEGORIES: 1283 establishments, History of Spain, Valencia

The Union of Valencia ([tpl]lang-es|Unión de Valencia[/tpl]) was an anti-royalist movement in the Kingdom of Valencia begun in 1283 and lasting into the fifteenth century. The Union was formed in the aftermath of the formation of the Union of Aragon in October 1283. Its essential purpose was as a tool of the Valencian nobility to be used against the influence of Catalans and foreigners on the actions of the Crown. By 1285 the Unions had severely curtailed the powers of the king and were hindering his efforts in the War of the Sicilian Vespers and against the Aragonese Crusade that invaded Catalonia that year. 
In 1347 during the cortes of Zaragoza, the Union of Valencia allied with that of Aragon and demanded the right to appoint a Justícia in Valencia like the Aragonese Unidos had. They then successfully besieged the royalist castle of Játiva. The Union persuaded Ferdinand, Prince of Aragon to be their lieutenant-general and, with an army of 30,000, he dealt the royalists a second defeat.Durham, 117. Then Peter IV went from Barcelona to Valencia to negotiate with the leaders of the Union. The Aragonese union sent a troop of reinforcements, around 20,000, to Ferdinand. Peter offered to declare Ferdinand his heir, but negotiations broke down. Peter was briefly imprisoned in Morvedre in early 1348; only the arrival of the Black Death forced his release. When he had again obtained the upper hand, Peter ordered the "great bell" that had been used to rally the Unidos to be melted and its liquor poured down the throats of the Union's leaders.Reilly, 183. This was only after Peter had returned to Zaragoza to repeal his concessions to the Aragonese union, which had been defeated by the royalists during their attempted siege of Epila in July, c.f. Holmes, 44–5. Peter was even implicated in the death (by poisoning) of his brother James I, Count of Urgell, that year; James had been a supporter of the Union.Fowler, 158. The Catalan historian Pere Tomich suspected natural causes but nonetheless reports the rumours of poisoning at the king's orders. On 1 November 1348, the Union attacked the Jews of Morvedre because they, being by law serfs of the Crown, were considered de jure royalists.Meyerson (2004), 212. 
In 1401 King Martin granted the Union the right to use the royal flag, the senyera (actually a likeness of the penó de la conquesta), with the Union symbol on it.

[[Hermosa Soberana]]
CATEGORIES: Historical national anthems, Spanish-language songs, Nicaraguan songs

Hermosa Soberana (Spanish for Beautiful and Sovereign) was the national anthem of Nicaragua from 1893 until 1910. 
The anthem was dedicated to General José Santos Zelaya, and it was adopted as the national anthem in September 1893. The music was composed by Alejandro Cousin (a son-in-law of General Santos), who also composed the 1889-1893 national anthem. The author is not exactly known, but probably it was written by one of the following three poets: Rubén Darío, Santiago Argüello or Manuel Maldonado. Although replaced in 1910, "Hermosa Soberana" is still popular as a patriotic song.[tpl]cite news | title = Nicaragua National Anthem (1893-1910) | url =http://www.nationalanthems.us/forum/YaBB.pl?num=1094147444 | accessdate = 2008-10-05[/tpl]

The Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (圣母圣衣堂), more often colloquially referred to as Xizhimen Church (西直门天主堂), is a Roman Catholic Church located on the southern side at n.130 of Xizhimen Neidajie in Beijing.  It is commonly referred to as Xitang (西堂, the West Church) to the locals.
The church at Xizhimen was the last among the four historic Catholic churches in Beijing. The West Church was first built in the first year of Emperor Yongzheng (1723) by the Italian Lazarist missionary Teodorico Pedrini: it was the first non-Jesuit church in Beijing.
After Pedrini's death the church was run by Carmelites and then Augustinians, who were there when it was destroyed in 1811. The church was rebuilt in 1867.  After a second destruction in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion, it was built again in 1912 as we can see it today. 
Delicate Collins pillars and Gothic peaked arches inside the church create a grand, elegant and solemn impression upon visitors.http://www.china.org.cn/travel/beijingguide/2008-05/19/content_15339810.htm

Anna Mildred Veitch B.A. (1889 – 1971) was the last member of the Veitch family of horticulturists to manage the family business of Veitch Nurseries.
She was the daughter of Peter Veitch and his wife, Harriett Drew, and after completing her education joined the family business in Exeter. Following her father's death in 1929, she took over the business although she retained the business name, "Robert Veitch and Son".
In 1931, the nurseries made their final move to larger premises in Alphington which were closer to another large site in Exminster. The interests in the High Street, Exeter were moved to Cathedral Close, and this shop and seed warehouse remained in business until the late 1960s.  
The independence of the Veitch Nurseries ended in 1969 when Mildred was forced to sell the company to St Bridget Nurseries due to ill health. The business of Robert Veitch and Son Ltd was run separately for nearly twenty years, but Veitch’s is now a subsidiary of St. Bridget and no longer trades under its own name. 
She is commemorated by a Camellia "Mildred Veitch".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hortic.com/ics/product/11080/1|title= Camellia Mildred Veitch |publisher=The International Camellia Society|date=| accessdate=5 October 2008[/tpl]

In geometry, the Möbius configuration or Möbius tetrads is a certain configuration in Euclidean space or projective space, consisting of two mutually inscribed tetrahedra: each vertex of one tetrahedron lies on a face plane of the other tetrahedron and vice versa. Thus, for the resulting system of eight points and eight planes, each point lies on four planes (the three planes defining it as a vertex of a tetrahedron and the fourth plane from the other tetrahedron that it lies on), and each plane contains four points (the three tetrahedron vertices of its face, and the vertex from the other tetrahedron that lies on it).

[[Skeletons (Stevie Wonder song)]]
CATEGORIES: 1988 songs, Stevie Wonder songs, Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles, Songs written by Stevie Wonder

"Skeletons" is a number-one R&B single by American recording artist Stevie Wonder in 1987 from his album, Characters. The song earned Stevie Wonder two 1988 Grammy Award nominations for Best R&B Song and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance, while the album Characters would be nominated the following year for Best R&B Male Vocal Performance.
"Skeletons" went to number one on the Black Singles Chart, and peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 19, becoming the final top 40 hit for Wonder to date.[tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=636[/tpl] The single also peaked at number 20 on the dance chart.[tpl]cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=283[/tpl]
The song is an soul/R&B jam about lies and deceptions being uncovered. One version features short sound bites from prominent figures such as Col. Oliver North ("I am not ashamed of anything in my professional and personal conduct") and President Ronald Reagan ("The United States has not made concessions to those who hold our people captive in Lebanon") among others. This has remained a popular R&B uptempo song for Stevie Wonder, as well receiving airplay from urban radio stations.
The song was featured in the 1988 (jobs) action film Die Hard, played when the character Argyle speaks on the phone.
The song was also used in the second trailer of the videogame Grand Theft Auto V, as well as appearing on the in-game radio station Space 103.2, reigniting the popularity of the song on sites such as YouTube.

Arthur Veitch (1844 – 1880) was one of a long line of horticulturists who established the renowned family business Veitch Nurseries.
Arthur was the son of James Veitch, Jr., who had established the Chelsea, London branch of the family business. Whilst his brothers, John (1839 – 1870) and Harry (1840 – 1924), were to make significant marks on the history of the English garden, little is recorded about Arthur, and he is conspicuously absent from "Hortus Veitchii", the family history.
He is recorded in the 1871 census as living at 5 Oakfield Street, Chelsea with his wife, Emily. The house had been constructed in the 1860s and the plans were drawn by the architect, George Godwin.[tpl]cite web |url=http://athomeinnchelsea.com/oakfield.htm|title= Oakfield Street, a Brief History |publisher=www.athomeinnchelsea.com nursery|date=| accessdate=5 October 2008[/tpl]

[[WDPM-DT]]
CATEGORIES: Channel 23 digital TV stations in the United States

WDPM-DT is a religious television station in Mobile, Alabama, which broadcast locally on UHF channel 23 as an affiliate of the Daystar Television Network. Broadcasting from its transmitter near Robertsdale, Alabama, the station signed on after the analog signal of WSRE (PBS channel 23) signed off for the last time on February 17, 2009.
Since the "channel 23.1" series of virtual channel designations already identifies the existing PBS member station's digital subchannels, this numbering sequence would not be available to the new station. According to the ATSC standard, WDPM-DT's channel numbers would therefore need to be displayed (using PSIP) using numbering based on WSRE's digital channel number, 31.ATSC standard A/65C, Annex 'B', Advanced Television Systems Committee, May 2006. From sign-on until February 2010, the station displayed as Channel 4.1, which is considered a violation of these standards.  This was corrected for several months, but is currently happening again.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
The audio of this digital broadcast is also in perpetual clipping mode. The average is about 7dB hotter than current limits of digital broadcast audio and is "breaking up" on all programs. (Oct 2011 referenced)

Bluey and Curley is an Australian newspaper comic strip written by the Australian artist, caricaturist, and cartoonist Alex Gurney.Compare the simpler graphic style of the earliest, war-time strips (http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/44896616), with the much later far more developed style of the 1955 version (http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/59702279 plus http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/page/4531381).
Few original Bluey and Curley strips are held in public collections, because, throughout his lifetime, Alex Gurney was renowned for his generous habit of giving the original art work of his caricatures, cartoons, and comic strips to anyone who asked.For example, The Talk of the Town:The Tax Paradox, The (Adelaide Mail, ((Saturday, 7 October 1933), p.7; http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/28322207.

[[Abstract algebra]]
CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra

In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra is a common name for the sub-area that studies algebraic structures in their own right. Such structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, and algebras. The specific term abstract algebra was coined at the beginning of the 20th century to distinguish this area from the other parts of algebra. The term modern algebra has also been used to denote abstract algebra.
Two mathematical subject areas that study the properties of algebraic structures viewed as a whole are
universal algebra and category theory. Algebraic structures, together with the associated homomorphisms, form categories. Category theory is a powerful formalism for studying and comparing different algebraic structures.

[[Kimberley Warm Springs]]
CATEGORIES: North West Tasmania, Hot springs of Australia

Kimberley Warm Springs are a geothermal feature and semi-developed visitor site located within the town of Kimberley, north west Tasmania. 
The Springs are located within the Kimberley Warm Springs Reserve managed by Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania. The reserve features a constructed pool, approximately 13m by 20m wide and 1.2m in depth, a sheltered barbecue area, parking and public toilets. Access to the site is from Warm Springs Road off Morrison Street. The site is well signposted within the town.
Water from the springs remains at a constant temperature of 24-25°C. The water's chemical composition suggests it gains its heat from hotter sub-surface materials. The dissolved solids content is fairly low and contains mainly bicarbonate and calcium ions.[tpl]cite AHD|19966|Kimberley Warm Springs Reserve[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Thermal spring at Kimberley|author=W. L. Matthews|date=1978|publisher=Mineral Resources Tasmania|url=http://www.mrt.tas.gov.au/webdoc2/app/default/document_domrept_detail?id=68827[/tpl]
The clearance of shading vegetation has led to excessive algal growth which is periodically removed as it covers the naturally sandy bottom of the spring.
The spring represents the only one of its kind in the region of north west of Tasmania. The spring is home to an endemic snail and an algae (Pithophora spp.) not previously recorded south of Sydney.

[[Offshore Racing Congress Rule]]
CATEGORIES: Sailing rules and handicapping

The Offshore Racing Congress Rule is a system of handicapping sailboats for the purpose of racing that is being developed and promoted to replace the IRC currently in general use (as of 2008). It is managed by the Offshore Racing Congress (ORC) and is usually referred to in the sailing community simply as "ORC".
ORC is an enhanced version of the earlier IMS handicapping system that was the dominant system used globally from the early 1990s to the early 2000s.
The ORC rule uses essentially the same concepts as the earlier IMS system but with a much more sophisticated velocity prediction program performing the handicapping calculations than was available in the IMS era. This improved program is designed to eliminate the problems that led to IMS falling out of favour with yacht clubs in the early 2000s.
IMS is (as of 2008) gaining support among the premium ocean racing clubs around the worldInterview with Syd FischerORC Presentation in Sydney as it is an open system, where all the details of the handicapping formula are available to designers and boat owners. This allows a greater degree of certainty when designing boats than closed, secret formulas such as IRC allow for. However, the 'secret' nature of the IRC rule has also been praised, as encouraging designers to simply design the 'best boat', and not produce the extreme and often unsafe designs which became the hallmark of the IOR rule. Being open, every individual yacht club can perform the handicapping calculations and issue handicap certificates for the yachts in their own fleets. This eliminates the bottle necks and delays encountered when waiting for certificates to be issued by a single global authority, such as has been experienced with the IRC rule.
To encourage the growth of the rule, two versions have been developed. The ORC-International rule (ORCi) is the full complexity, highly developed version for top level championship racing. An ORC-Club rule has also been developed, which is a simplified version more easily used by smaller clubs who have less resources.

CATEGORIES: Pistol and rifle cartridges, Rimfire cartridges, 1890 introductions

The .22 Winchester Rimfire (commonly called the .22 WRF) is an American rimfire rifle cartridge.
Introduced in the Winchester  M1890 slide rifle, it had a flat-nose slug, and is identical to the .22 Remington Special (which differed only in having a roundnosed slug).Barnes, p.275, ".22 Winchester Rimfire (WRF)". It uses a flat-based, inside-lubricated bullet, which differs from the outside-lube slug of the .22 Short, Long, LR, and Extra Long rounds.
When introduced, the .22WRF "was the first notable improvement in the killing power" over the .22LR,Barnes, p.275, ".22 Winchester Rimfire (WRF). and was able to kill cleaner at up to 75 yd (70 m). It is somewhat less accurate than the .22 LR and is most suited to hunting small game such as rabbits or prairie dogs. 
A variety of Winchester, Remington, and Stevens single-shots and repeater rifles were offered from 1890 onward, but new rifles are not made for this cartridge. .22 WRF ammunition is periodically offered by commercial makers for use in the old guns. It can be fired in any rifle chambered for the more powerful .22 WMR. The shorter WRF cartridge may be limited to single shot use in WMR rifles, since it may not feed from WMR length magazines, depending on design.

John Gould Veitch (April 1839 – 13 August 1870) was a horticulturist and traveller, one of the first Victorian plant hunters to visit Japan. A great-grandson of John Veitch, the founder of the Veitch horticulture dynasty, he also visited the Philippines, Australia, Fiji, and other Polynesian islands. 
He brought back a number of the glasshouse plants in vogue at the time, such as Acalyphas, Cordylines, Codiaeums (Crotons) and Dracaenas, and, from Fiji, a palm of a new genus later named after him, Veitchia joannis. The Veitch family name is honoured by hundreds of plant names, including the genus Veitchia.[tpl]cite book|last=Veitch|first=James H. |authorlink= James Herbert Veitch|title=Hortus Veitchii: a history of the rise and progress of the nurseries of Messrs.

Veitch & sons. |page=295[/tpl] The Veitch nursery introduced 232 orchids, some 500 greenhouse plants, 118 exotic ferns, about 50 conifers, 153 deciduous trees, 72 evergreen and climbing shrubs, 122 herbaceous and 37 bulbous plants from various corners of the globe.[tpl]cite web|last=Mills|first=Virginia|title=From Chelsea to Mount Fuji, the legacy of Veitch Nurseries|url=http://www.kew.org/news/kew-blogs/library-art-archives/index.htm?ssNextRow=81|publisher=Kew Gardens|accessdate=28 March 2014|date=20 May 2011[/tpl]
In Japan, he came across the eminent plant collector Robert Fortune, and their competing collections returned to England on the same ship. For example, both men claimed discovery of a species of Chamaecyparis pisifera.
He was married to Jane Hodge soon after his return to England in 1866 and fathered two sons,  James Herbert Veitch  (1868 – 1907) and John Gould Veitch, Jr. (1869 – 1914) before dying of tuberculosis at the age of 31.

Injuries restricted the centre's appearances over the years and when he finished in 1989 he had managed just 59 senior games. 
After Gary Buckenara was sacked as Sydney's coach in 1993, Scott acted as a caretaker coach for a couple of games.

[[Williams Point]]
CATEGORIES: Headlands of Livingston Island

Williams Point is the point forming both the north extremity of Varna Peninsula and the northeast tip of Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.  Separated from Zed Islands to the north by Iglika Passage.
The discovery of the South Shetland Islands was first reported in 1819 by William Smith, Master of the brig Williams who had sighted the point on 19 February that year.  An 1820 publication suggests that Smith gave the name ‘Williams’ to a point of land in this vicinity.  In recent years the place name Williams Point has been established in international usage for the point described.

Hillcroft School was a boys' secondary school in South London. In 1960, it was established in Tooting Bec, being built on playing fields of, and adjacent to, the premises of Bec School.[ref]
</ref> The initial complement of pupils were drawn from Hillbrook Secondary School in Hillbrook Road, Tooting, and Estreham Secondary School in Penwortham Road, Streatham (housed in the same building as Penwortham Primary School). Hillbrook and Estreham then closed.
The school closed when it was amalgamated with Bec School in 1970 to create Bec-Hillcroft Comprehensive School. Bec-Hillcroft was renamed Ernest Bevin School, after the former Labour minister Ernest Bevin, in the next year. In 1996, the school was renamed to Ernest Bevin College.

[[Hero Bay]]

CATEGORIES: Bays of Livingston Island

Hero Bay ([tpl]Coord|62|31|S|60|27|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title[/tpl]) is a bay, [tpl]convert|17|nmi|km[/tpl] wide, which indents for [tpl]convert|6|nmi|km[/tpl] the northern side of Livingston Island between Cape Shirreff and Williams Point, in the South Shetland Islands. The name "Blythe Bay", originally applied to a small bay on the southeast side of Desolation Island on George Powell's chart of 1822 published by Richard Holmes Laurie, was erroneously transferred to this bay in the 1930s. This error has now been rectified and a new name approved for the feature here described. Hero Bay is named for the American sloop Hero, under Captain Nathaniel B. Palmer, which was one of the vessels of the Pendleton sealing fleet from Stonington, Connecticut, which visited the South Shetland Islands in 1820–21.

[[Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter]]
CATEGORIES: Mass-produced roller coasters

The Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter is a popular roller coaster design built by Gerstlauer. It was launched in 2003 and now has many installations around the world, including a number yet to be completed. The trademark feature of the roller coaster is its 'beyond vertical' drop, which reaches an angle greater than 90 degrees. Although the majority of Euro-Fighters are custom designed for each installation, every design so far has included the trademark drop. A number of different track elements are possible, including vertical loops, diving loops, barrel rolls etc. In addition, every Euro-Fighter has a vertical chain lift hill, often (but not always) preceding the 'beyond vertical' drop and compact Euro-Fighters, such as the 320+ models, always have a cutback inversion.
Riders are transported in individual cars around the track, which feature two rows of four seats.  Two exceptions are Huracan at the Belantis amusement park in Germany and "Dare Devil Dive" at Six Flags Over Georgia, which both feature cars similar to those used on Gerstlauer's launched roller coasters. The cars have over-the-shoulder restraints and may be themed (to an extent) according to the customer's requirements. Dare Devil Dive's car's are the first to use a new lap-bar only restraint system. 
Fluch von Novgorod, located at Hansa Park in Germany was the first Euro-Fighter to incorporate both a vertical lift and an LSM launch in the same circuit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gerstlauer-rides.de/english/Gerstlauer_E.html|title=Gerstlauer's page for Fluch von Novgorod under 'New Projects'|accessdate=2009-03-08[/tpl]

ActoGeniX is a biopharmaceutical company, based in Ghent, Belgium, focused on the development and commercialization of ActoBiotics™, a novel class of orally available biopharmaceuticals for the targeted treatment of severe diseases with a high medical need. 
ActoBiotics™ represent a novel concept for oral administration of therapeutic proteins. ActoBiotics™ can deliver therapeutic peptides and proteins, including cytokines, enzymes, hormones and monoclonal antibodies.Steidler L & Vandenbroucke K.

AG013, ActoGeniX´s lead ActoBiotic™ for the treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients has been evaluated in a phase 1B clinical trial in the US, confirming safety and tolerability as well as initial efficacy. Analysis of initial efficacy showed a 35% reduction of the percentage of days with ulcerative oral mucositis in the AG013-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients. Close to 30% of the patients treated with AG013 were full responders while all placebo-treated patients developed ulcerative oral mucositis.http://www.actogenix.com/eng/documents/news/pressreleases/ActoGeniX%20Press%20Release%20ENG%2015%20Sept%202011.pdf 
In preclinical models, ActoGeniX has confirmed the applicability of ActoBiotics™ for diseases including gastrointestinal, metabolic, immune diseases and allergies.
ActoGeniX was founded in 2006 as a spin-off from VIB and Ghent University. The Company is headquartered in Ghent (Belgium) and employs approximately 20 employees, half of whom are PhD’s, MD’s, or PharmD’s. ActoGeniX raised 35.5 million Euro (approximately 50 million US$) in two equity financing rounds from a consortium of leading life sciences investors such as GIMV, Biotech Fund Flanders, Baekeland Fund, Biovest (Belgium), Life Sciences Partners, Aescap Venture (The Netherlands) and Ventech (France).
ActoGeniX has a broad intellectual property position with a patent estate encompassing more than 20 distinct patent families. 
In April 2012, Prof. Chantal Mathieu and her team at the University Hospital of Leuven announced a major breakthrough in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes with an ActoBiotic™.http://www.kuleuven.be/english/news/a-permanent-cure-for-type-1-diabetes The ActoBiotic™ can stably reinstate normal glucose levels in Type 1 diabetic mice. This strategy was without side effects and can now be further developed for human application. The results of the study have been published in the authoritative Journal of Clinical Investigation.http://www.jci.org/articles/view/60530

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Luigi Cherubini, Requiems

[tpl]Reimprove|date=July 2010[/tpl]The Requiem in C minor for mixed chorus was written by Luigi Cherubini in 1815 and premiered  21 January 1816 at a commemoration service for Louis XVI of France. Cherubini's setting of the requiem was considered by Beethoven to be superior to Mozart's.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
Ludwig van Beethoven listened to Cherubini's operas with the keenest attention (the evidence is there in Fidelio) and declared that, if ever he should write a Requiem, his model would be Cherubini's C minor setting.

The Central Jewish Bureau ([tpl]lang-pl|Centralne Biuro Żydowskie[/tpl], CBŻ) was a Jewish autonomous section inside the Communist Party of Poland. The CBŻ was founded shortly after the Kombund had merged into the Communist Party in 1923. The role of the CBŻ was to mobilize support for the Communist Party amongst the Jewish community.Jaff Schatz. Jews and the communist movement in interwar Poland. In: Jonathan Frankel. Dark Times, Dire Decisions: Jews and Communism. Studies in Contemporary Jewry. Oxford University Press US, 2005, p. 20. However, not all Jewish party members were part of the CBŻ; assimilated Jewish communists were active in the main Polish party organization.Joseph Marcus.

Giorgos Toursounidis (born 21 August 1970) is a retired Greek footballer. He played for PAOK and Xanthi.
Toursounidis was born in 1970. He made 263 league appearances for PAOK, scoring 35 goals, and became a fan favorite due to his work ethic and obsession with the club. His most memorable game for PAOK was an away game against bitter rivals Aris Thessaloniki F.C., with PAOK winning by a score of 4-0. Toursounidis left PAOK in 1999, spending two seasons at Xanthi. He retired soon after.

John Beach ([tpl]coord|62|39|23|S|60|45|44|W|display=inline,title[/tpl]) is a beach on the west side of the entrance to Walker Bay on the south coast of Livingston Island, in the South Shetland Islands.

The beach was roughly charted and named "Black Point" by Robert Fildes in 1820–22. As there was already a Black Point on Livingston Island, this name was rejected and a new one substituted by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1958. John Beach is named after the brig John (Captain John Walker) of London, which was sealing in the South Shetland Islands in 1820–21 and 1821–22.

McClelland College, is a secondary school in Karingal. The school resides in the suburb of Frankston located in Victoria, Australia.  The school has received a lot of government funding for their research into new learning environments and for their new VCE centre.
Previously known as Karingal Park Secondary College, the school was created after a merger of two other secondary colleges in the same area, Karingal Secondary College (formerly Karingal High School) and Ballam Park Secondary College (formerly Ballam Park Technical College). Karingal High School was originally located in the Life Saving Club in Frankston, during the 1950s, before relocating to the suburb of Karingal.
In 2009 Karingal Park Secondary College changed its name to McClelland Secondary College, although it was also known as McClelland College by the community. This decision was taken by the staff of the school and the local council. This led to a change in the school's uniform, and the school's colours are now purple and grey.

[[Green jack]]

CATEGORIES: Caranx, Fish of the Pacific Ocean, Fish of the Gulf of California, Western Central American coastal fauna, Galápagos Islands coastal fauna

The green jack, Caranx caballus (also known as the horse jack), is an abundant species of coastal marine fish in the jack family Carangidae. The species is distributed in the eastern Pacific Ocean along the American coastline from Santa Cruz Island off California in the north to Peru in the south, as well as a number of islands including the Galapagos and recently, Hawaii. The green jack is distinguished from other similar carangid species by a number of features including gill raker and lateral line scale counts, and the presence of an adipose eyelid. It is a moderately large species, growing to at least 55 cm in length and 2.81 kg, although unconfirmed reports suggest a much larger maximum size. It lives in a wide range of continental shelf environments including estuaries, bays, reefs and offshore seamounts, living both pelagically and demersally. The green jack is a predatory species, preying on  a variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, as well as zooplankton. Most fish are sexually mature by the time they attain 38 cm, with spawning occurring between May and October. The species is of high importance to fisheries throughout its range, caught by pelagic trawls, a variety of netting methods and hook and line. The green jack is also of interest to anglers, taken by bait and lures, although is considered to only be fair in eating quality.

The publisher of the first Bulgarian-language magazine, he is regarded as the founder of the Bulgarian press.
Fotinov was born in the town of Samokov around 1790 to the family of a small-time merchant from Plovdiv. He studied at a local monastical school before continuing his education in Plovdiv in Thrace and in Kydonies in Anatolia; he was tutored by the Greek humanist Theophilos Kairis. He worked on a translation of the Bible into Bulgarian for the BFBS, but they did not approve it. From 1828 on, Fotinov worked as a teacher and man of letters. He founded a private mixed Hellenic-Bulgarian school in İzmir (Smyrna) and employed the Bell-Lancaster method. The school's programme included Bulgarian, Greek and French classes. It had around 200 pupils from all around the Bulgarian lands.
Fotinov was the editor and publisher of the first Bulgarian magazine, Lyuboslovie ("philology", "love of words"), which he issued in Smyrna from 1844 to 1846. The magazine was richly illustrated and included articles on history, geography, religion, morale, enlightenment, medicine, hygiene, language, etc. Fotinov also published a Greek grammar book (1838) and a Bulgarian phrasebook (1845) and translated a geographic book from Greek to Bulgarian (1843).

The feature was known to American and British sealers as Blythe Bay as early as 1821. In the 1930s, however, the name was applied to a large bay between Williams Point and Cape Shirreff (now Hero Bay).  This error has now been rectified and the name Blythe Bay is approved as originally used. The name is probably after Blythe (now Blyth), England, home of William Smith who reported the discovery of the South Shetland Islands in 1819.

He was the author of a collection of the Acts of the councils of the Catholic Church, from the council of Nicaea to his own time. William CaveHistoria Literaria i. 411. fixes the date at which Sabinus flourished as c. 425.
The church history of Sabinus was much used by Socrates of Constantinople in his Ecclesiastical History, who speaks of it as untrustworthy, because Sabinus was partisan, and omitted, and even wilfully altered, facts and statements adverse to his views and interests.Socr. i. 8; ii. 15. Socrates shews how Sabinus tries to disparage the fathers of Nicaea in the face of the contrary evidence of Eusebius, and makes no mention whatever of Macedonius, lest he should have to describe his deeds.
Baroniusad ann. 325, xxxix., ad ann. 344, iii. etc. speaks strongly of Sabinus's unscrupulous handling of history, calls him "homo mendacissimus," and suggests that Sozomen gives a garbled account of the election of Athanasius, "ex officina Sabini."

[[Pandy, Wrexham]]
CATEGORIES: Wrexham

The Pandy (Welsh  Y Pandy, meaning the fulling mill)  is a village near Gwersyllt and Rhosrobin in the borough of Wrexham, the main entrance to Gresford Colliery stood in the village. Gresford Colliery Social Club is in the village and alongside it a memorial to the Gresford Disaster  which killed 266 men on September 22, 1934.
Plas Acton Road originally linked the village to the main Chester Road, but was severed by the A483 by-pass, a large footbridge crosses the new road maintaining the link for pedestrians only. There are the remains of a mill on the River Alyn just below the village at the rear of the Pandy Business Park, in an area known as "The Wilderness".
The Gresford Heath estate, built around the year 2000 on the site of the coalsheds for the former Colliery, doubled the population of the village.  The naming reflects an attempt to raise house values in a former industrial village and to deWelshify the village name. A new development of 9 luxury houses has been built on the site of the former Goodwins Milk/Express Dairy depot. There have been further plans for housing to go on the nearby fields to Pandy but local people have objected to more houses. 
The coal tip on the edge of the village is the proposed site of a development of a dry ski slope, conveniently located on the main Wrexham - Chester road.  There are two small industrial estates in the village again on the old Colliery site.

Krestovsky Island ([tpl]lang-ru|Крестовский остров[/tpl]) is a 3.4 km² island in Saint Petersburg, Russia, situated between several tributaries of the Neva: the Srednyaya Nevka, the Malaya Nevka and the Krestovka. The island is served by the Krestovsky Ostrov "Крестовский остров" station of Saint Petersburg Metro. Until recently, the western part of the island was occupied by the Maritime Victory Park, where the international Goodwill Games of sports and athletics competition took place in 1994, which was the first large scale post-Soviet Union international event in Russia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/parks/maritime-victory-park.asp |title=Maritime Victory Park |accessdate=2009-06-17 |work=Saint-Petersburg.com [/tpl] A new stadium Zenit Stadium is currently under construction, where Kirov Stadium was previously located. The Zenit stadium will serve the same name club, which is the leading St Petersburg football club. FC Zenit Saint Petersburg has frequently led the Russian football top league and recently has had good international success, in the Champions/UEFA leagues. 
Meanwhile, the eastern part of this beautiful St Petersburg island, has seen slow but steady urbanization since the early 1900s, which has slowly changed its parkland nature.  Recently there has been even more pressure from today's "nomenclature" to locate top-end housing projects and high-prestige homes here - a long-time tendency that also continues today, since historically the island was always owned by families who were close to and favourites of the Tzars/"powers-to-be" and who served them well.

Hambleton Junction is a grade-separated railway junction near Selby, North Yorkshire, England, which connects the East Coast Main Line with the Leeds to Selby Line.
The junction was opened in 1983 as part of the Selby Diversion, which diverted the East Coast Main Line away from the Selby coalfield. The Leeds to Selby Line passes over the East Coast Main Line on a bridge. Sharply-curved chords allow southbound trains on the East Coast Main Line to head eastwards towards Selby (and vice versa), and eastbound trains heading away from Leeds to join the southbound East Coast Main Line (and vice versa).
The junction is regularly used by Northern Rail services between York and Selby.

Longridge Circuit was a motor racing circuit built in the former Tootle Heights quarry close to Longridge, Lancashire, England. This circuit may be unique in the world in being the only motor racing track situated in a quarry.Peter Swinger, “Motor Racing Circuits in England : Then & Now" (Ian Allan Publishing, ISBN 0 7110 3104 5, 2008)
The roads used for the extremely short circuit were already in place when racing started in 1973, although sprint events were held prior to this. Racing continued until 1978 on this 0.43 miles long (0.69 km) circuit, which meant that starters was limited to a maximum of 10.
In 1978 the site was sold, which caused considerable ill-feeling amongst those who organised the sport for both two and four wheels for they were not informed of the impending sale, and consequent loss of the venue as plans for 1979 were being laid.Peter Swinger, “Motor Racing Circuits in England : Then & Now" (Ian Allan Publishing, ISBN 0 7110 3104 5, 2008)

[[Kazakhstania]]
CATEGORIES: Geology of Kazakhstan, Historical continents, Paleozoic, Geography of Kazakhstan, Geography of Xinjiang, Natural history of Asia

Kazakhstania, also known as the Kazakhstan Block, is a small continental region in the interior of Asia. It consists of the area north and east of the Aral Sea, south of the Siberian craton and west of the Altai Mountains and Lake Balkhash. Politically, it comprises most of Kazakhstan and has a total area of around 1.3 million km². The Junggar basin in Xinjiang, China is also part of Kazakhstania, though sometimes referred to as the Junggar Block.
It is believed that present-day Kazakhstania is chiefly a mélange of early Paleozoic volcanic island arcs and some small continental terranes. These were joined together during the Ordovician to form what was at the time an isolated continent of its own. During the Carboniferous and Permian, Siberia collided with Kazakhstania to form the Altai Mountains, later Baltica collided in the Ural orogeny, creating the basis for most of present-day Eurasia.
Kazakhstania is mainly flat: only in the east near Karaganda are there mountains and these only rise to 1,565 metres (5,130 feet) in the Tarbagatay Range. Although most of Kazakhstania is arid and practically no water flows from the region to the oceans, there is extensive grazing of cattle, sheep and camels on the grasslands which cover most of the region today. Kazakhstania was too dry for extensive glaciation during the Quaternary. Kazakhstania contains as much as a quarter of the world's proven uranium reserves and is also one of the world's major source of lead, zinc, and antimony ores. On the southern boundary in the Turan Depression are large deposits of natural gas formed as a result of its collision with the Indian plate.

Deep Purple in Rock (also known as In Rock) is the fourth album by English rock band Deep Purple, released in June 1970. It was their fourth studio album and the first with the classic Mk II lineup. Rod Evans (vocals) and Nick Simper (bass) had been fired in June 1969 and were replaced by Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, respectively.
Deep Purple in Rock was their breakthrough album in Europe and would peak at #4 in the UK, remaining in the charts for months. (The band's prior MK I albums had been much better received in North America than in their homeland.) The album was supported by the hugely successful In Rock World Tour which lasted 15 months.
Although this was the first studio album to feature the MK II lineup of the band, it was this lineup that had earlier recorded the live Concerto for Group and Orchestra. The album was also preceded by two singles, the first studio recordings that Gillan made with Deep Purple. The first single, released in 1969, was a Greenaway-Cook composition called "Hallelujah", which flopped. The second single, "Black Night", fared much better as it rose all the way to #2 on the UK charts.
In 2005 the album won the Classic Rock and Roll of Honour Award (given by the British monthly magazine  Classic Rock) in the category Classic Album. The award was presented to Ian Gillan, Ian Paice and Jon Lord.

[[Airy wave theory]]

CATEGORIES: Water waves, Wave mechanics, Physical oceanography

In fluid dynamics, Airy wave theory (often referred to as linear wave theory) gives a linearised description of the propagation of gravity waves on the surface of a homogeneous fluid layer. The theory assumes that the fluid layer has a uniform mean depth, and that the fluid flow is inviscid, incompressible and irrotational. This theory was first published, in correct form, by George Biddell Airy in the 19th century.Craik (2004).
Airy wave theory is often applied in ocean engineering and coastal engineering for the modelling of random sea states – giving a description of the wave kinematics and dynamics of high-enough accuracy for many purposes.
Dean & Dalrymple (1991). Further, several second-order nonlinear properties of surface gravity waves, and their propagation, can be estimated from its results.Phillips (1977), §3.2, pp. 37–43 and §3.6, pp. 60–69. Airy wave theory is also a good approximation for tsunami waves in the ocean, before they steepen near the coast.
This linear theory is often used to get a quick and rough estimate of wave characteristics and their effects. This approximation is accurate for small ratios of the wave height to water depth (for waves in shallow water), and wave height to wavelength (for waves in deep water).

John Raymond Douglas (born 24 October 1951 in Brunswick East) is a former Australian sportsman who played Australian rules football in the Victorian Football League (VFL) with North Melbourne during the 1970s and first-class cricket for Victoria.
From the Coburg Amateurs originally, Douglas made his VFL debut in the opening round of the 1972 season against St Kilda, whose Brownlow Medal rover Ross Smith was celebrating his 200th game. He played six further games that year and didn't appear again until 1975, when North Melbourne won their inaugural premiership with Douglas taking the field three times during the home and away season. He finished his football career after playing just two games in 1976, to finish with 12 games and eight goals for North Melbourne.
A right-arm fast-medium pace bowler, Douglas claimed 30 wickets at 26.53 from his nine first-class matches. The first lot of matches came during the summer of 1975/76, while he was still a North Melbourne player, beginning with a Sheffield Shield encounter against New South Wales. Test player John Dyson was his maiden wicket and he finished his first innings with 4/65.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/35/35774.html|title=Victoria v New South Wales 1975/76| publisher=CricketArchive[/tpl]

Bassett was not the fastest full back, but had a great positional sense on the field which ensured he was always close to the action. He was seen as one of the most devastating tacklers in the game, and many opposing backs would throw the ball into touch rather than allow Bassett to hit them in full flow.

Storfjorden or Storfjord is a [tpl]convert|110|km|adj=on[/tpl] long fjord in the Sunnmøre region of Møre og Romsdal county, Norway.  It stretches from the village of Hareid in the west to the villages of Tafjord and Geiranger in the east. The Storfjorden system branches off into several smaller fjords including the famous Geirangerfjord and Tafjorden.   At the village of Stranda, the main fjord branches off into the Sunnylvsfjorden-Geirangerfjorden to the west and the Norddalsfjorden-Tafjorden to the east. 
The name literally means the "big" or "great" fjord, indicating that this is a long fjord and it is, in fact, the main fjord in this region. Stretching about [tpl]convert|110|km[/tpl], Storfjord is the 5th longest fjord in Norway.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Statistics Norway|language=Norwegian|url=http://www.ssb.no/aarbok/kart/i.html|title=Yearbook[/tpl] The Storfjord is a dominant topographical feature in the Sunnmøre region as it cuts the region in two parts that are only connected by ferry. The deepest point in the fjord is [tpl]convert|679|m[/tpl] near the village of Dyrkorn in Stordal Municipality.
The landscape around Storfjorden is typical for Western Norway. The mouth the fjord is surrounded by islands with mountains reaching [tpl]convert|500|to|800|m[/tpl] above sea level.  Further to the east there are higher mountains.  At the villages of Tafjord and Geiranger, the  mountains climb to about [tpl]convert|1500|to|1800|m[/tpl] above sea level.  Most of the Storfjorden has characteristically steep or very steep shores, interrupted by several gentle valleys stretching up to [tpl]convert|30|km[/tpl] into the hinterland. In this way, the Storfjorden system is, along with the Nordfjorden, Sognefjorden, and Hardangerfjorden fjord-systems, the major samples of the typical west coast fjords highly praised by visitors.[tpl]cite web|publisher=National Geographic Magazine|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/features/destinationsrated0403/destinationsrated.html|title=Destination Scorecard: 115 Places Rated|accessdate=2010-09-21[/tpl]

The Medical Practitioners' Union is a section of Unite the Union, a trade union in the United Kingdom.
The union was founded as the Medico-Political Union in 1914 and was renamed the Medical Practitioners' Union in 1922.  It amalgamated with the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs in 1970 under the leadership of Hugh Faulkner.  It remained a distinct section through a series of mergers which formed Manufacturing, Science and Finance, Amicus and ultimately Unite.Records of the Medical Practitioners' Union, University of Warwick Modern Records Centre
The union published Medical World.  This originated in 1913 as the official journal of the State
Medical Service Association, but was adopted as the official union journal the following year.  The union opposed the British Medical Association.  It aimed to extend the provision of medical care by the state, while retaining the independence of general practitioners.Roger Cooter, The Rise and Decline of the Medical Member: Doctors and Parliament in Edwardian and Interwar Britain

Chínipas de Almada is a town in the south-western portion of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, in the Sierra Madre Occidental. It serves as the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of Chínipas.  
The name honours Francisco R. Almada, a historian and two-time governor of Chihuahua born in the town; the "de Almada" suffix was added by the State Congress on 17 June 1976, when Chínipas served as the state capital for one day.
In the 2005 INEGI Census, the reported a total population of 1,398.[tpl]cite web|title=Chinipas|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/chihuahua/Mpios/08020a.htm|work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal  |accessdate=2008-08-22[/tpl] 
Chínipas was founded as a mission town by the Jesuits Pedro Juan Castini and Julio Pascual on 31 December 1626. They were both killed, and the mission destroyed, during a Native war against the Spaniards, specifically on 1 February 1632. The mission was rebuilt, slightly down-stream, in 1676. 
Gold was found locally in 1798, which led to the towns rapid expansion with European settlers in the late 19th century. Well known local family names include Piero, Sarracino the Santinis from Italy, Balderrama from Spain, the Schultzes from Germany, the Russos from Sicily, the O'Leary's from Ireland (now spelled Alire), the Bridge's from England (now spelled Breach) and the Willis' from England (now spelled Villis). The largest mine was called the Palmarejo and was British owned. The equipment was manufactured in England, shipped to Guaymas on the Sonora coast, transported by mule or donkey to San Bernardo, Sonora and then by over the mountain on peoples backs.Richard Grant.

The High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Cyprus is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in the Republic of Cyprus.
Previously a territory of the Ottoman Empire, a British protectorate under Ottoman suzerainty was established over Cyprus by the Cyprus Convention of 4 June 1878. The United Kingdom declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November 1914 and annexed Cyprus. Turkey recognised British possession of Cyprus by the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923 and the island became a Crown Colony on 10 March 1925. Following the Zürich and London Agreement of 19 February 1959, Cyprus became independent on 16 August 1960. The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the British Commonwealth, so the British diplomatic representative is a High Commissioner.

CATEGORIES: Mod revival, British pop punk musical groups, Musical groups established in 1978, English New Wave musical groups

The Fixations were a mod revival band from North London that formed in 1978. An early incarnation of the band, including Ken Gamby (drums), Paul Cathcart (vocals, lead guitar), Paul Cattini (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Noel Hughes (bass) started in summer 1976. The line-up changed in 1978 with Richard Sharp joining the band on rhythm guitar. Later Cathcart switched to lead guitar and taught Richard bass guitar, and gigs were lined up by November 1978, making them one of the first bands in the mod revival scene, and gaining a very early mention in Sounds.
They played at venues such as Dingwalls, The Marquee Club, Club 100, The Music Machine and Pied Bull, where they held a residency. They toured all over England with The Chords, Teenbeats, Purple Hearts, The Scooters, The Killermeters and other mod revivalists. Unlike many of the mod revival bands, they did not play any cover versions. Lyrically, they tackled a range of subjects, and a number of their songs covered attitudes to the work environment.
Their management turned down a number of record deals, so no vinyl records exist by this band, despite recording a double A side ("No Way Out"/"Clever Remarks") with Larry Wallace for Carerre. Detour Records has released The Sound Of Young London, and a book has been written by their drummer called The Fixations Modest Recognition. Written by Ken Gamby and Paul Cattini, the book chronicles the history of the band.

]]
The shrouded tidal turbine is an emerging tidal stream technology that has a turbine enclosed in a venturi shaped shroud or duct (ventuduct), producing a sub atmosphere of low pressure behind the turbine. The venturi shrouded turbine is not subject to the Betz limit and allows the turbine to operate at higher efficiencies than the turbine alone by increasing the volume of the flow over the turbine. Claimed improvements vary, from 1.15 to 4 times higher power output [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyberiad.net/library/pdf/bk_tidal_paper25apr06.pdf |title=Brian Kirke's published article Developments in Ducted Water Turbines |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28[/tpl] than the same turbine minus the shroud. The Betz limit of 59.3% conversion efficiency for a turbine in an open flow still applies, but is applied to the much larger shroud cross-section rather than the small turbine cross-section.

Fiji gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1970. As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Kingdom and Fiji conduct their diplomatic relations at governmental level, rather than between Heads of State. Therefore the countries exchange High Commissioners, rather than ambassadors.
The British High Commissioner to Fiji (or, from 1988 to 1997, the British Ambassador to Fiji) has also acted at various times as High Commissioner to the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Nauru, the Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu and the Republic of Vanuatu.

United Jewish Socialist Workers Party ([tpl]lang-yi|פֿאַראײניקטע ייִדישע סאָציאַליסטישע אַרבעטער־פּאַרטיי[/tpl], fareynikte yidishe sotsialistishe arbeter-partey) was a political party in Poland and Ukraine. Members of the party along with the Poalei Zion participated in the government of Ukraine and condemned the October Revolution in Petrograd proposing a peaceful resolution of political changes in Russia.
Its followers were generally known simply for the first portion of the name Fareynikte (פֿאַראײניקטע) - 'United'. Politically the party favored national personal autonomy for the Jewish community.Ėstraĭkh, G. In Harness: Yiddish Writers' Romance with Communism. Judaic traditions in literature, music, and art. Syracuse, New York: Syracuse University Press, 2005. p. 30 The party upheld the ideas of building a secular Jewish community.Berkowitz, Michael. Nationalism, Zionism and Ethnic Mobilization of the Jews in 1900 and Beyond. IJS studies in Judaica, v. 2. Leiden: Brill, 2004. p. 225
Fareynikte was founded in JuneVirtual Jewish Encyclopedia [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] 1917 through the merger of two groups, the Zionist Socialist Workers Party (SSRP) (Socialist-Territorialists) and the Jewish Socialist Workers Party (SERP). SERP's ideology was based particularly upon "autonomism". Note that some of the leaders from those two parties did not join Fareynikte, but rather became "Folkists" (Folkspartei). Both SSRP and SERP had emerged from the Vozrozhdenie group. As of early 1918, Fareynikte was the largest Jewish autonomist political party in the independent Ukraine.Jaff Schatz. Jews and the communist movement in interwar Poland. In: Jonathan Frankel. Dark Times, Dire Decisions: Jews and Communism. Studies in Contemporary Jewry. Oxford University Press US, 2005, p. 79.
The Faraynikte's program claimed "unity of the Jewish worker's class as an integral part of the 'extraterritorial' Jewish nation and international proletariat". The previous arguments in regard to the way of implementing the territorialists program have been declared as less important. The focal point of the party program a "national-individual autonomy". For a brief period the party acquired a major influence, particularly in Ukraine where it played an important role in an attempt to organize the Jewish national autonomy. In September 1917 Fareynikte petitioned to the Provisional Government to declare the equality of language.
In the 1917 elections in Russia, the party obtained around 8% of the Jewish votes.Pinkus, Benjamin. The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority. Soviet and East European studies.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. p. 44

Fareynikte ran some Yiddish newspapers in Ukraine. It published the Naye tsayt (New Time) in Kiev September 1917-May 1919.

Grindley railway station was a former British railway station to serve the village of  Grindley in Staffordshire. 
It was opened by the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway in 1867 and closed in 1939. The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway was purchased for £100,000 by the Great Northern Railway in July 1881 and the line subsequently passed into LNER ownership with Railway Grouping in 1923.
Originally single line, a passing loop was added in 1887. Built in a cutting, the main station buildings were next to the road above, with the booking office on the main platform. Like most of the others on the line, the platforms were staggered, both accessible by cart tracks.Jones P (1981) The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway, Salisbury: The Oakwood Press
Two miles further north the single line entered Bromshall Tunnel before reaching its junction with North Staffordshire Railway line to Uttoxeter.

CATEGORIES: Disused railway stations in Staffordshire, Former Great Northern Railway stations, Railway stations opened in 1867, Railway stations closed in 1939

Chartley railway station was a former British railway station to serve the village of  Stowe-by-Chartley in Staffordshire. 
It was opened by the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway in 1867 and renamed Stowe in 1874 and also known as Chartley and Stowe.Jones P (1981) The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway, Salisbury: The Oakwood Press Passenger services finished in 1939.
The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway was purchased for £100,000 by the Great Northern Railway in July 1881 and the line subsequently passed into LNER ownership with Railway Grouping in 1923.
In 1882 it was the scene of a serious accident.  A special train had been provided for the Meynell Hunt.  It left Derby Friargate with four horseboxes from GNR and the MS&LR plus three passenger carriages.  At Sudbury six North Staffordshire horseboxes were added after the first coach, which was behind the engine.  Thus only one vehicle was continuously braked. Although the driver was using care in approaching stations, he was being piloted by the fireman who knew the line, but not that the passing loop at Chartley had just been brought into use. The train approached Chartley at 30 to 35 miles an hour and the leading coach became derailed. This caused the horseboxes to strike the timber platform, causing severe damage, and several horses were killed or injured. Luckily none of the passengers or crew were hurt. The Inspecting Officer for the Board of Trade recommended that, in future, the facing points for all passing loops should be straight, with the "S" curve at the trailing end.

[[Spin-flip]]

CATEGORIES: Radio galaxies, Supermassive black holes, Black holes

A black hole spin-flip occurs when the spin axis of a rotating black hole undergoes a sudden change in orientation due to absorption of a second (smaller) black hole.
Spin-flips are believed to be a consequence of galaxy mergers, when two supermassive black holes form a bound pair at the center of the merged galaxy and coalesce after emitting gravitational waves.
Spin-flips are significant astrophysically since a number of physical processes are associated with black hole spins; for instance, jets in active galaxies are believed to be launched parallel to the spin axes of supermassive black holes.
A change in the rotation axis of a black hole due to a spin-flip would therefore result in a change in the direction of the jet.

Although in a country area and in some distance from the village it served, the station building was in an ornate Jacobean style with ornate gable ends and, on the entrance side, a substantial Porte-cochère.[tpl]cite web |url= http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1039003 |title=Sandon Railway Station |work=The National Heritage List for England |publisher= English Heritage |accessdate=6 January 2012[/tpl] This was for the convenience of Dudley Ryder, 2nd Earl of Harrowby, who was about to have a new Jacobethan country house built in nearby Sandon Park. There was a decorated timber awning and, on the opposite platform, a small but similarly elegant waiting-room.
It[tpl]Clarify|date=January 2012[/tpl] was built on the down, Stoke, side of the bridge of the present B5066 road, and at the other end was a long siding accessed from both running lines by trailing crossovers, with a short spur back to the station. To simplify shunting, authority had been given[tpl]By whom|date=January 2012[/tpl] to use a tow rope which was kept beneath the signal box. Further along the line was a private siding belonging to the Earl to service his gasworks which was also controlled by Sandon box.[tpl]cite book |last1=Hendry |first1=R.

It was a busy main line but few trains called at the station. Under the 1923 grouping it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. By 1938 there were only two trains on weekdays and four on Saturdays.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] The LMS closed the station to passengers on 6 January 1947 and British Railways closed it to goods on 5 September 1955.
The station buildings gradually deteriorated until the Sandon Estate bought them in 1970.

Salt and Sandon railway station was a former British railway station opened by the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway to serve the village of  Salt in Staffordshire in 1867[ref]Jones P (1981) The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway, Salisbury: The Oakwood Press
[/ref]
Until 1904 it was known simply as "Salt" the name being changed to avoid confusion with Sandon and Salt station on the North Staffordshire Railway. Sandon was actually about two miles away, the station being nearer to Sandon Bank.
The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway was purchased for £100,000 by the Great Northern Railway in July 1881 and the line subsequently passed into LNER ownership with Railway Grouping in 1923.
From Salt the line turned sharply south east towards Ingestre, before passing under the North Staffordshire Railway's main line from Stone to Colwich.
Passenger services finished in 1939

CATEGORIES: 1992 albums, Michael Nesmith albums

 Allmusic review 
|}}
"... Tropical Campfire's ..." is an album by Michael Nesmith, released in 1992 after Nesmith's 13-year hiatus from making studio albums.  "... Tropical Campfire's ..." is the 9th and final time Red Rhodes would play on a Michael Nesmith studio album (Rhodes died in 1995).
Allmusic writes "Along with Lindsey Buckingham's Out of the Cradle, this album may be one of the finest and most underrated albums of the 1990s."
All versions of this album were released encoded in the Dolby Digital Pro-Logic surround sound format. It can be decoded into surround sound using any Pro-Logic  multichannel receiver.
The unique (and seemingly, at first, incorrect) spelling of the album's title comes from an excerpt printed inside the CD booklet: "... Now she must navigate by the southwestern tropical campfire's mambo raga songs, their sounds rising from the desert floor ..."  The original 1992 CD on Pacific Arts reads "campfire's" but the 2001 and 2008 reissues have the apostrophe missing from the cover artwork.

CATEGORIES: Disused railway stations in Staffordshire, Former Great Northern Railway stations, Railway stations opened in 1874, Railway stations closed in 1939

Stafford Common railway station was a former British railway station on the outskirts of Stafford.
It was opened by the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway in 1874 about seven years after the line opened. There was a single platform with a stationmaster's office and waiting room, but it included a goods yard and an engine shed. It became the headquarters of the line, to reduce dependence on the LNWR at Stafford station.
The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway was purchased for £100,000 by the Great Northern Railway in July 1881 and the line subsequently passed into LNER ownership with Railway Grouping in 1923.
The original station was to the southwest of the Marston Road bridge (now Common Road). When the GNR doubled the line, the station was rebuilt on the other side of the bridge and bordering on Aston Terrace. It had two platforms and opened in 1882. [tpl]cite book |author=Jones P |date=1981 |title=The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway |location=Salisbury |publisher=The Oakwood Press[/tpl] The station buildings were on the bridge, timber throughout, with covered steps to the platforms where there were small shelters.
Passenger services finished in 1939, though it remained open as Stafford Common Air Ministry Sidings until 1952. Both of the station's platforms remain in situ, albeit under vegetation, and the line through the station has been converted into a public footpath.
From there the line climbed steeply at 1 in 70 before falling at 1 in 75 to Salt and Sandon.

It was located in the Xinfu District, Fushun, Liaoning. Among the inmates were Puyi,[tpl]cite book|last=Puyi|coauthors=Paul Kramer, Simon Paul Kramer|title=The Last Manchu: The Autobiography of Henry Pu Yi, Last Emperor of China|publisher=A. Barker|year=1967|pages=318 pages[/tpl] the last emperor of China and former puppet emperor of Manchukuo, his younger brother Pujie and several other important World War II figures such as Xi Qia, Zang Shiyi and Zhang Jinghui. Part of the prison site remains in use, but the older section has been turned into a museum depicting the history of Fushun war criminals management centre and the life of the people who worked or were interned there.
The prison was originally constructed in 1936 by the occupying Japanese. At the end of World War II, the USSR had overrun the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and captured many of its government members and military personnel, both Chinese and Japanese. These prisoners were held near Khabarovsk (Boli) in the Russian Far East. During 1949 and early 1950, the Chinese sent delegations to the USSR headed by Mao Zedong in which they secured the extradition of these prisoners to China. Premier Zhou Enlai instructed the Northeast Judicial Department to make preparations for handling the war criminals. Liaodong No. 3 prison, on the northern edge of Fushun city, was selected for conversion into the War Criminals Management Centre.
The first train carrying prisoners arrived in Fushun station at 3 o'clock on July 21, 1950. They were then transferred the short distance to the prison by bus. In this first train load there were 969 Japanese detainees and 71 prisoners from the Manchukuo puppet regeme. Some other Japanese prisoners were transferred from other locations such as Taiyuan War Criminals Management Centre, to bring the total number of Japanese prisoners to 982. The Japanese prisoners can be divided by occupation into 667 army personnel, 116 gendarme, 155 special police and 44 administrative. Of these 35 had the rank of general, 125 were field officers and 852 were junior officers or below.[tpl]cite book|title=日本战犯的再生之地: Zhongguo Fushun zhan fan guan li suo|editor=Fushun zhan fan guan li suo (China), 抚顺战犯管理所|publisher=五洲传播出版社|year=2005|pages=221|isbn=7-5085-0734-7[/tpl] Alongside these prisoners from World War II were inmates from the Chinese Civil War that ended in 1949. These Kuomintang prisoners numbered 354. 
In 1956, trials of the Japanese prisoners were undertaken. Over the period 1956 to 1964, the Japanese prisoners were all released.[tpl]cite book|last=Takashi|first=Yoshida|title=The Making of the "Rape of Nanking"|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2006|pages=268|isbn=0-19-518096-8[/tpl] Between 1959 and 1975, the Manchukuo and Kuomintang prisoners received special pardons and were released in stages. In total over 1300 prisoners had passed through the centre. 
The Fushun War Criminals Management Centre was converted, in 1986, to a museum and opened to the public. The War Criminals Management Centre was depicted in several scenes of the 1987 Bernardo Bertolucci film, The Last Emperor, which won 9 Oscars.

[[National Debt Clock]]

The National Debt Clock is a billboard-sized running total display which constantly updates to show the current United States gross national debt and each American family's share of the debt.  It is currently installed on Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City.
The idea for the clock came from New York real estate developer Seymour Durst, who wanted to highlight the rising national debt. In 1989, he sponsored the installation of the first clock, which was originally placed on Sixth Avenue—between 42nd Street and 43rd Street—one block away Times Square. At the time, the national debt remained under $3 trillion but was rising. The clock was temporarily switched off from 2000 to 2002 due to the debt actually falling during that period.
In 2004, the original clock was dismantled and replaced by the current clock at the new location one block away. In 2008, the U.S. national debt exceeded $10 trillion for the first time, leading to press reports that the clock had run out of digits.
The original clock outlived Seymour, who died in 1995, with Seymour's son Douglas taking over responsibility for the clock through the Durst Organization. As of September 2009, Douglas Durst's cousin Jonathan "Jody" Durst, with whom he currently shares a co-presidency of the company, is in the process of taking over the day-to-day operations as president. In an interview with The New York Times, Jonathan Durst has said that maintenance of the clock is planned "for years to come."[tpl]cite news|title=Square Feet [tpl]![/tpl] The 30-Minute Interview: Jonathan Durst|first=Vivian|last=Marino|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/realestate/commercial/13SqFt.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate=September 15, 2009[/tpl]

When an experiment is conducted, one (and only one) outcome results— although this outcome may be included in any number of events, all of which would be said to have occurred on that trial. After conducting many trials of the same experiment and pooling the results, an experimenter can begin to assess the empirical probabilities of the various outcomes and events that can occur in the experiment and apply the methods of statistical analysis.

[[Culpa in contrahendo]]
CATEGORIES: Contract law, Latin legal terms

Culpa in contrahendo is a Latin expression meaning "fault in conclusion of a contract". It is an important concept in contract law for many civil law countries, which recognise a clear duty to negotiate with care, and not to lead a negotiating partner to act to his detriment before a firm contract is concluded. In German contract law, §311 BGB lists a number of steps by which an obligation to pay damages may be created.
By contrast, in English contract law, and many other common law jurisdictions, there has been stulted judicial acceptance of this concept. The doctrine of estoppel has been mooted by academics as a good model, but judges have refused to let it be a sidestep of the doctrine of consideration, saying estoppel must be a shield not a sword, and calling instead for Parliamentary intervention. On the other hand in the case of land, proprietary estoppel effectively created obligations regardless of any pre-existing contract. In the United States, however, courts have allowed promissory estoppel to function as a substitute for the consideration doctrine. This movement was stimulated by the acceptance of the concept in section 90 of the first Restatement of Contracts.

[[Pashto grammar]]

CATEGORIES: Pashto language, Grammars of specific languages

Pashto is a S-O-V language with split ergativity. Adjectives come before nouns. Nouns and adjectives are inflected for gender (masc./fem.), number (sing./plur.), and case (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). The verb system is very intricate with the following tenses:  present; subjunctive; simple past; past progressive; present perfect; and past perfect.  In any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect, past perfect), Pashto is an ergative language; i.e., transitive verbs in any of the past tenses agree with the object of the sentence. The dialects show some non-standard grammatical features, some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms that are discarded by the literary language.

The first published material written fully in the Lun Bawang language is a translation of the Bible in 1982, which is called Bala Luk Do. A Lun Bawang–English dictionary was constructed in 1969 by the University of Washington. A dialect of the Lun Bawang language, Kemaloh Lundayeh, was recently (2006) compiled into a bilingual dictionary of Lundayeh language and English.
The Lun Bawang language is mainly an oral language. There is very little printed written material in this language that was not written by missionaries or linguists. The oral culture of the Lun Bawang people is changing though, with the accessibility of the Internet and Facebook. Putoh may be the same language.

[[Beryl (given name)]]
Beryl is a given name which is deemed unisex due to occasional American usage as a male name, as such probably a variant spelling of the surname Burrell whose seeming root is the Old French bovre a reddish-brown woolen fabric with the resultant name denoting a worker in the wool trade; Beryl may also be a variant spelling of the Yiddish (Judeo-German) male name Berel.
Overwhelmingly the name Beryl has been borne by females being a jewel name with reference to the mineral beryl. Like most jewel names, Beryl's use as a female name dates from the late 19th century: dancer Beryl de Zoete and actress Beryl Mercer would have been among the earliest namesakes being born respectively in 1879 and 1882. The female name Beryl was always more popular in the British Isles than in North America; since the mid-20th century the name has become somewhat unfashionable in the British Isles while its North American usage has grown peripheral.

Asahi Dam is a dam built on the class 1 Hida River (part of the Kiso River water system), located in Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan.
The large-scale hydroelectricity-generating dam is managed directly by Chubu Electric Power, Co., and was built as part of the first step of a consistent development plan for the Hida River basin. It is an 87.0-meter-tall concrete gravity dam, and the first high dam on the Hida River. Akigami Dam on the Akigami River was constructed at the same time; they both create water reservoirs which, when used effectively, allow for stable, fortified hydroelectric power via generation stations at the downstream Hida River area, even in times of drought. The artificial lake created by Asahi Dam is Asahi Reservoir.

Kaloyan ([tpl]lang-bg|Калоян[/tpl]; Old Bulgarian: КАЛѠѢНѢ) was a 13th-century Bulgarian noble, sebastocrator of Sredets (Sofia) and the surrounding region during the Asen dynasty of the Second Bulgarian Empire.
Kaloyan may have been the grandson of Tsar Ivan Asen I (1189–1196) from his younger son sebastocrator Alexander, as he is mentioned as a cousin of Tsar Constantine Tih (1257–1277); however, his relation to the royal family may have been merely titular. Kaloyan was an opponent of Tsar Michael Asen I's (1246–1256) pro-Byzantine policy and took part in the plot against him.[tpl]cite book |title=Електронно издание "История на България" |language=Bulgarian |last=Бакалов |first=Георги |coauthors=Милен Куманов |publisher=Труд, Сирма |location=София |year=2003 |isbn=954528613X |chapter=КАЛОЯН (неизв.-след 1259)[/tpl]
Sebastocrator Kaloyan is mainly known as the main donor of the Boyana Church, a medieval Eastern Orthodox church in Boyana, Sofia. An inscription from 1259 in the church describes Kaloyan's role in its construction; he is also referred to as a grandson of the Serbian king Saint Stephen. The church also features donor portraits of Kaloyan and his wife Desislava.
It has been theorized that Kaloyan reconstructed Roman Emperor Constantine I's palace in Sofia and used it as his city residence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.online.bg/kultura/my_html/2333/antichen.htm|title=Новият проблем на София|last=Желева-Мартинс|first=Добрина|coauthors=Валентина Върбанова|date=2004-08-23|publisher=Култура|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl] Two other small churches in Sofia, St Petka the Old and St Nicholas, have also been attributed to his donorship.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sofia.bg/history.asp?ime=blank&title=%D0%A1%D0%9E%D0%A4%D0%98%D0%AF%20-%20127%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%20%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0&fail=&lines=551&nxt=1&update=allhttp|title=София—127 години столица|language=Bulgarian|publisher=Столична община|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl]

Charles Léo Lesquereux (November 18, 1806 – October 25, 1889) was a Swiss bryologist and a pioneer of American paleobotany. He was born in the town of Fleurier, located in the canton of Neuchâtel.
Due to a childhood accident, Lesquereux suffered from progressive hearing loss that eventually led to total deafness. Despite the fact he lacked formal training in botany, he became a celebrated figure in the field of paleobotany. Until 1827 he took classes at the academy at Neuchâtel, and subsequently worked as a tutor of French language in Eisenach. Afterwards he returned to Switzerland as a schoolteacher, and later principal in the town of Locle. Within three years his hearing had deteriorated to the point he had to give up his teaching job. 
As a young man he took many excursions in order to collect mosses in the Jura Mountains, eventually leading to investigations of peat bogs. His pioneer research and analysis on the origin, composition and development of peat resulted in a close friendship with famed scientist Louis Agassiz (1807-1873). Soon afterwards, Lesquereux was commissioned by the Prussian government to perform scientific studies of peat bogs throughout Europe. 
In 1847 Lesquereux followed Agassiz to the United States, subsequently traveling to Columbus, Ohio, where he performed bryological research with William Starling Sullivant (1803-1873). With Sullivant, he published two editions of a treatise called Musci Exsiccati Americani (1856, 1865). Another significant work on American bryology of his, was a two volume summary of mosses found in the eastern United States, titled Icones Muscorum (1864).
Based on his past studies of European peat bogs, Lesquereux developed theories on the origin of coal formations. As a consultant for state geological surveys in several U.S. states, he performed pioneer investigations of Paleozoic flora. From these paleobotanical studies, his best work was a study of carboniferous flora of Pennsylvania, titled "Description of the Coal Flora of the Carboniferous Formation in Pennsylvania and throughout the United States" (1879–84). a three-volume publication that became a standard for U.S. carboniferous flora. 
The plant genus Lesquerella from the family Brassicaceae is named in his honor. Lesquereux died at the age of 82 on October 25, 1889 in Columbus.

[[Financial betting]]
CATEGORIES: Wagering, Financial markets

Financial betting refers to the wagering on the price development of a financial instrument at some later date relative to the current price or level of the instrument, against odds offered by a bookmaker. Maximum potential pay-off of the wager is known when the bet is taken and as a corollary risk is known beforehand by being limited to the initial stake.
Financial betting instruments are a type of digital option. The outcome of the wager at settlement is binary, that is, either a win or a loss. Settlement is executed in cash and there is no delivery of the underlying asset. At any point in time prior to the settlement date bets can often be sold, allowing for possibilities to bet on the accuracy of a market move within the fixed limits of zero win (loss of the stake) and maximum potential win. A fee might sometimes be charged for this service.
The main difference between financial betting and speculation on financial markets using products such as financial spread betting is that the bet must result in a simple binary win or loss based on an event on the underlying financial instruments.  This triggers a fixed payout for a win, while with spread betting the payout or loss varies with the price level of the underlying instrument.

[[Bad Girl (The Miracles song)]]

CATEGORIES: 1959 singles, The Miracles songs, Songs written by Smokey Robinson, Doo-wop songs, Motown singles, Songs written by Berry Gordy

"Bad Girl" is a 1959 Doo-wop single by The Miracles. Issued locally on the Motown Records label, it was licensed to and issued nationally by Chess Records because the fledgling Motown Record Corporation did not, at that time, have national distribution. It was the first single released (and the only one released by this group) on the Motown label - all previous singles from the company (and all following ones from the group) were released on Motown's Tamla label. Although The Miracles had charted regionally and on the R&B charts with several earlier songs, including "Got A Job", "I Cry", "I Need A Change", and "(You Can) Depend On Me", "Bad Girl" was their first national chart hit, reaching #93 on the Billboard Hot 100. Written by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson and Motown Records' President and Founder Berry Gordy, "Bad Girl" is a sad, remorseful ballad about a young woman, whom Robinson, as the narrator, says "was so good at the start", but who later in the song "is breaking my heart". It is in the popular Doo-wop style, as several of The Miracles' songs were during the late 1950s. The record's success, coupled with the distributor's failure to pay Gordy and The Miracles properly for its sales, prompted Robinson to urge Gordy to "go national" with it, meaning that Motown should do its own national distribution of its songs, and eliminate the middleman, to ensure that all money from sales of its records would go directly to the label.
On the Motown/Universal DVD Smokey Robinson and The Miracles: The Definitive Performances 1963-1987, Robinson and fellow Miracles Bobby Rogers and Pete Moore comment that the song's success allowed the group to tour nationally for the first time, and to play New York's legendary Apollo Theatre during the Ray Charles Show. The group was not ready for the appearance: it lacked performance experience and failed to produce professional big band arrangements to the satisfaction of theatre manager Honi Coles. Ray Charles intervened, took the group under his wing, and, with his band, created arrangements for their songs. Charles was one of the first to help them on their climb to eventual success.
"Bad Girl" has since become a Doo-wop classic and was named one of the 100 Greatest Doo-Wop Songs of All Time by Doo Wop Nation.home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/Top_100-Part_2.html It appears on several Miracles' compilations, including Greatest Hits from the Beginning. The song was also performed by the group on their final live album, 1957–1972. It has been covered by the Dazz Band and by Motown artist Mary Wells, whose version was called "Bad Boy" and appeared on her debut album, Bye Bye Baby I Don't Want to Take a Chance.

Livingston is a surname with several different origins. The name itself originates in Scotland as a habitational name derived from Livingston in Lothian which was originally named in Middle English Levingston. This place name was originally named after a man named Levin who appears in several 12th century charters. In Ireland (and in some cases Scotland), the name was adopted by Gaelic Ireland royals bearing the Gaelic surnames Ó Duinnshléibhe and Mac Duinnshléibhe.

Jack Murdock (28 October 1922 – 27 April 2001) was an American actor. He appeared in 50 films between 1973 and 1998. He was born in Urbana, Ohio.
Murdock had some television roles in St. Louis, Missouri during the 1960s.  One memorable role was as Kronos, the host of the television show Zone 2 on KTVI from August 1965 to August 1966.  The show was named Zone 2 because KTVI-TV (the local ABC affiliate at the time and currently a Fox affiliate) broadcast on Channel 2 and probably as a play on The Twilight Zone as it aired low-budget science fiction and horror movies.  It aired at 3:30 pm–5:30 pm for the benefit of school-age kids.  The movies shown were severely edited to fit into the time slot, to make room for commercials, and to allow for Kronos to introduce each segment.
Murdock appeared in Big Top Pee-wee with New York City natives Albert Henderson and David Byrd. He was also familiar to St. Louis television viewers as the personification of "Grandpa Pidgeon" on commercials for the GrandPa's chain (also known as Grandpa Pidgeon's) of 15 discount retail stores in the St. Louis area and nearby Illinois and Missouri locations.
He hosted the local KTVI-TV presentation of Adventures of Superman in 1962, appearing as Mr. Willoughby on a program called Treehouse Time.  Mr. Willoughby lived in a treehouse and introduced Superman and a cartoon from there.  The show was 45 minutes long, leaving 15 minutes for local news at the head of the hour. He died in Burbank, California at age seventy-eight.

[[Basic Parachute Course]]
CATEGORIES: Parachuting, Military education and training in the United Kingdom

The Basic Parachute Course for members of the British Armed Forces is conducted by the Static Line Training Squadron of No.1 Parachute Training School RAF, based at RAF Brize Norton.
The Basic Parachute Course is 4 weeks long for regular troops. During that time, trainees are instructed in exit, flight and landing techniques. They are required to complete eight descents, one at night, to qualify for their 'wings'. Exit training is carried out from full-size mock ups of C-130 Hercules fuselages. In groups of eight, each with its own RAF parachute jumping instructor (PJI), trainees are taught the techniques of jumping individually and in 'sticks', both with and without equipment. Trainees are taught fight drills while suspended from the hangar roof in parachute harnesses on cables. They learn to control their parachutes while descending, and to carry out emergency measures, such as untwisting their rigging lines, taking the necessary action on colliding with another parachutist, and landing in water. Techniques for landing safely are taught using rubber mats. As trainees become more proficient, the height from which they jump is increased by the use of steps and eventually ramps which they run and jump off of. Forward, side and backwards landings are practiced on a six-sided trapeze from which the trainees hang by their hands while being swung in the air.  On the command of the PJI, trainees let go and perform the appropriate roll on landing.
The next stage involves the fan trainer. Wearing a harness connected to a cable wound round a drum fitted with fan blades, trainees jump from a platform located near the roof of the hangar; as they fall, their rate of descent is controlled to simulate that with a parachute. More advanced training comes with the exit trainer, designed to simulate the effect of slipstream as the parachutist exits the aircraft. The trainer consists of a wooden cabin, mounted on a structure of girders, equipped with doors representing those on the port and starboard side of the Hercules. On either side cables run from above the trainer to a point near the ground some 55 yards away. Wearing harnesses suspended from them, trainees jump from the trainer and travel the length of the cables in a gradual descent towards the ground, where their progress is arrested by an instructor.
The next stage of the course consists of a parachute descent from a balloon at the dropping zone at Weston-on-the-Green. This is carried out from a height of 800ft (244m) in what is known as "clean fatigue" - without equipment. Subsequently trainees carry out their first descent from a C-130 Hercules in single 'sticks' of six without equipment from one door of the aircraft. Their second descent is again in 'clean fatigue', in single 'sticks' of eight or ten. Trainees then make their third descent, jumping in simultaneous 'sticks' of six from both sides of a Hercules. This is followed by a night descent without equipment. Thereafter, descents are made with equipment, initially in a single 'stick' of six, subsequently in simultaneous 'sticks' of eight or ten and finally in the maximum size of 'stick' possible, depending  upon the number of personnel on the course.

The Door of Prophecies or Gate of Prophecies is a large door inside the Syrian Monastery, of Wadi El Natrun (Natron Valley) in Egypt, that features symbolic diagrams depicting the past and the future of the Christian faith through the eyes of Christian monks of the tenth century. Several centuries ago, that location was used mainly by Syrian monks, however today the monastery is used and preserved by Coptic monks and the Coptic Church, as both Churches have been in friendship and alliance since early Christianity. The Door of Prophecies dates to the beginning of the tenth century, around 913–914 AD, according to the Syriac language inscriptions on it, during the papacy of Pope Gabriel I of Alexandria (910–921).  The panels on the large door divide and represent Christian epochs through time, epochs preceding the time of its construction, the tenth century and also prophesizing and predicting future time periods. 
The door of prophecies is a screen of a main sanctuary inside the monastery. It consists of six vertical leaves (panels) and seven horizontal rows, three forming a valve on each side. Each one of the six leaves has seven panels of ebony magnificently inlaid with ivory, however, today some of the panels are not in their original condition. From top to bottom they represent seven epochs which are believed to cover the history of Christianity, its past and future, highlighting its golden age, periods of major changes, hardships, and persecution. 
The historical and spiritual interpretations of the panels are highly individual. The following are the seven epochs:

[[Granny Kempock Stone]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Inverclyde, Witchcraft, Visitor attractions in Inverclyde

The megalithic Kempock Stone, popularly known as Granny Kempock (perhaps because of its resemblance to an old woman), stands on a cliff behind Kempock Street, the main shopping street in Gourock, Scotland. The stone, or menhir, is grey mica schist and of indeterminate origin, but it has been suggested that it is an old altar to the pagan god Baal, or a memorial to an ancient battle. Supposedly there is a superstition that for sailors going on a long voyage or a couple about to be married, walking seven times around the stone would ensure good fortune. A flight of steps winds up to the stone from Kempock Street below.
There is also an association with witchcraft. In 1662 Mary Lamont and a group of other local women were burned to death in the local area after it was alleged that she and her coven had danced around the stone on the sabbath, with the intention of cursing and sinking shipping that passed through the Clyde by casting the long-stone into the sea.
A decorative iron archway sits above the passageway leading up to the stone.
A number of markings exist on the stone. Some of these appear to be 17th-19th century graffiti and most are obviously initials. Alongside some of these initials are some as yet unexplained symbols or markings which resemble modern-day navigation marks. These may be Mason's marks but it is unclear why someone would claim artistry on an irregularly shaped piece of stone with no apparent working unless of course it originally formed part of a larger structure, perhaps nearby Gourock Castle. There is also a 2 cm hole at the bottom of the stone. It is not known if this hole is goes all the way through the stone but if it does this could point to the stone having been moved at some point or used as perhaps an anchor stone or counterweight. Given the stone's current location it has been suggested that the stone's original location may have been elsewhere.
A 1987 children's TV series Shadow of the Stone written by Catherine Lucy Czerkawska dramatises the witchcraft element starring Shirley Henderson in the role of a young girl who has some kind of spiritual connection with Mary Lamont. Scenes were filmed in and around Gourock.
In "Notes about Gourock", published 1880, Reverend D. Macrae writes..
A Bronze Age standing stone dating from about 2000bc.
This is the famous 'Lang Stane' of Gourock, more familiarly spoken of as 'Granny Kempock'...It is
supposed that the Kempock Stone marks the site in Druid times of an altar to Baal...
However that may be, The Kempock Stane was for many centuries an object of superstitious awe and reverence...Marriages in the District were
not regarded as lucky unless the wedded pair passed round the 'lang stane', and obtained in this way Granny Kempock's blessing...
It was chiefly in connection with the winds and sea that the Kempock Stane was regarded with superstitious dread...sailors and fishermen were
we... to take a basketful of sand from the shore and walk seven times round Granny Kempock, chanting a weird song to insure for themselves a safe and prosperous voyage."

[[Hotel Continental, Oslo]]

CATEGORIES: Hotels in Oslo, Hotels established in 1900, 1900 establishments in Norway

Hotel Continental is a hotel in Oslo, Norway, that opened in 1900. 
The background story of the Continental is like an old fairytale, about a young couple, who through their hard work and entrepreneurship created a monument that will live for many years.  It all started in Sweden in 1860, with the birth of Caroline Boman.  Her family was poor, and instead of emigrating to America, something that was customary at the time, she crossed the border from Sweden to Christiania, now Oslo Norway in 1887, where she got a job as a cook. Four years later, she married Christian Hansen, who was from Oslo and worked as a waiter.
Hotel Continental and Theatercaféen opened in 1900, right after the opening of the National Theatre.  The business was originally owned by Foss Brewery, but was run by different tenants who all had to give up.  Caroline and Christian Boman Hansen took over the lease in 1909, and within only three years they were able to purchase the establishment. 
In 1932 and 1961 respectively the hotel and restaurant was expanded, and now occupies a whole block centrally located in the center of Oslo.  Through four generations the same family has built and developed the hotel and the restaurants into what the establishment is today. Elisabeth C. Brochmann is the current and fourth generation owner.  In 1985 she took over the daily operations from her mother Ellen Brochmann. 
The Hotel Continental offers 155 individually furnished rooms, many of which are newly renovated. The hotel is a 5 star property of high international standard, and is the only Norwegian member of The Leading Hotels of the World.  
The renowned restaurant Theatercaféen is part of the establishment. This newly renovated wiener-café is listed on the New York Times list of the world’s most famous Vienna-styled cafes. The hotel’s gourmet restaurant Eik Annen Etage is run by renown chef Ole Jonny Eikefjord in partnership with investor  Petter Stordalen. Hotel Continental has an extensive art collection, and in the lobby bar “Dagligstuen” there is a large collection of prints by Edvard Munch. In addition, the hotel has conference and banqueting facilities with the capacity of up to 300 guests.

[[Oliver's Mount]]
CATEGORIES: Motorsport venues in England, Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Sport in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Transmitter sites in England, Mountains and hills of North Yorkshire

Oliver's Mount is an area of high ground overlooking Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England. It offers impressive views of the town, a tribute monument to the war dead, camping and caravanning at selected times of the year and a cafe but may be primarily known for its motorcycle races (however cars have raced here twice, in 1955 and 1956). Oliver's Mount first held a motorcycle race in 1946, and continues to hold motorcycle circuit today, and also holds car rally and car hill-climb events.
The site also hosted a new family friendly music festival from summer 2012. Opening 'International Bike Week', the 'Future Of Music - Oliver's Mount Festival' will celebrate local, new music and will be held at Mount Farm, Oliver's Mount. It is being organised by the resident racing club 'Auto 66' and local music management and Promotion company 'Red Cherry Music'. It was first held over the weekend of 16 and 17 June 2012. 
The site also houses the broadcasting transmitter which provides TV and radio services to Scarborough and the surrounding areas.
Oliver's Mount is named after Oliver Cromwell, as it was thought that he had sited guns there, although there is no evidence that Cromwell visited Scarborough during the Civil War. This name was in use by 1804; previously the hill was known as Weaponness, which now refers to the area of the town around Oliver's Mount and Filey Road, and one of the wards of the borough.

The Oregon Central Rail Road was the name of two railroad companies in the U.S. state of Oregon, each of which claimed federal land grants that had been assigned to the state in 1866 to assist in building a line from Portland south into California. The "East Side Company" of Salem (incorporated 1867), supported by businessman Ben Holladay, eventually received the grant for its line east of the Willamette River, and was reorganized in 1870 as the Oregon and California Railroad (O&C), which completed the line in 1887. Portland supported the competing "West Side Company" (incorporated 1866), which only built to McMinnville, and was sold to the O&C in 1880. The O&C was later acquired by the Southern Pacific Company, and mostly remains as part of the Union Pacific Railroad's I-5 Corridor; the West Side line is now operated by the Portland and Western Railroad between Beaverton and Forest Grove.

[[Cross-polarized wave generation]]
CATEGORIES: Nonlinear optics

Cross polarized wave (XPW) generation is a nonlinear optical process that can be classified in the group of  frequency degenerate wave mixing processes. It can take place only in media with anisotropy of third order nonlinearity. As a result of such nonlinear optical interaction at the output of the nonlinear crystal it is generated a new linearly polarized wave at the same frequency, but with polarization oriented perpendicularly to the polarization of input wave
Simplified optical scheme for XPW generation is shown on Fig. 1. It consists of a nonlinear crystal plate (thick 1-2 mm) sandwiched between two crossed polarizers. The intensity of generated XPW  has cubic dependence with respect to the intensity of the input wave. In fact this is the main reason this effect is so successful for improvement of the contrast of the temporal and spatial profiles of femtosecond pulses. Since  cubic crystals are used as nonlinear media they are isotropic with respect to linear properties (there is no birefringence) and because of that the phase and group velocities of both waves XPW and the fundamental wave(FW) are equal:VXPW=VFW and Vgr,XPW=Vgr,FW. Consequence of that is ideal phase and group velocity matching for the two waves propagating along the crystal. This property allows obtaining very good efficiency of the XPW generation process with minimum distortions of the pulse shape and the spectrum.

Revised by Sue Steward. p112 gives 1987 as the date of death; earlier date here preferred on grounds of probability. was the longest-lived and one of the most important members of the Cuban trova. He was significant because, unlike most of the others, he specialized in Afro-Cuban genres. He was a disciple of the tresero Eduardo Fusté, and a member of early groups in Cárdenas, such as Peonia and that of Benito Tumborombo. Later he moved to Havana, where he joined Los Veintiuno, directed by Alejandro Sotolongo, which used claves, maracas, marimbula, bongó and pianito (a wooden instrument with hemp cords). He worked in other groups, and in the Sans-Souci, formerly the leading cabaret in Havana.Giro, Radamés 2007. Diccionario encyclopédico de la música en Cuba. vol 2, La Havana. p250
Ibáñez was the first trovador that we know of to specialize in the son and also on guaguancós and afrocuban rhythms from the abakuá. He played the Cuban tres rather than the Spanish guitar, and developed his own technique for this Cuban guitar. During his extremely long career, Chicho sang and played the son in streets, plazas, cafés, nightclubs and other venues throughout Cuba. In the 1920s, when the sextetos became popular, he was forced to sell his compositions to these larger groups and their composers in order to survive. His compositions include Tóma mamá que te manda tía, Evaristo, No te metas Caridad, Ojalá (sones); Yo era dichoso, Al fin mujer (bolero-sones); Qué más me pides, La saya de Oyá (guaguancos). He worked throughout Cuba, and latterly a short film was made of him.

CATEGORIES: Cinemas and movie theaters in Missouri, Movie theatre chains in the United States, Cinema pioneers, American people of Greek descent

The Skouras Brothers Enterprises Inc. was an American movie theater chain from the early days of film-making based in St. Louis, Missouri. It was owned and operated by three brothers: Charles, Spyros and George. Even though it never became as important and famous as other family based companies, like the Warner Brothers, its members came to play important roles in American film industry.
The Skouras brothers arrived in St. Louis in 1910 from Greece. Living frugally on wages as busboys and bartenders in downtown hotels, they pooled their savings of $3500 in 1914 and in partnership with two other Greeks, they constructed a modest nickelodeon (movie theater) at 1420 Market Street on the site of today's Peabody Opera House. This initial property, named the Olympia, was quickly followed by the acquisition of other theaters. 
The brothers incorporated in 1924 with $400,000 capital stock. By then more than thirty local theaters belonged to the  Skouras Brothers Co. of St. Louis. The biggest moment for the Skouras empire came when their dream of building a world-class movie palace in downtown St. Louis was grandly realized in 1926 when the $5.5 million Ambassador Theatre Building opened (this theater re-opened in 1939 as the New Fox Theatre). 
During the depression the company encountered financial trouble. Like many other movie and theatrer moguls the Skouras Brothers were fighting for their survival. In 1928, control of the Skouras Brothers Enterprises, Inc., and the St. Louis Amusement Company was acquired by Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc. and the brothers joined the film company as managers of film production. On January 24, 1931, the Skouras Brothers resigned from Warner Brothers. Skouras Brothers Withdraw as Managers Of Warner Brothers' Picture Operations
Spyros Skouras became in 1942 president of 20th Century Fox. During Skouras' tenure - which was the longest in the company's history -  he worked to rescue the faltering movie industry from television's lure. 20th Century Fox's famous advertising slogan, Movies are Better than Ever, gained credibility in 1953 when Spyros introduced Cinemascope in the studio's groundbreaking feature film The Robe. With his introduction of Cinemascope, Skouras did much to save the movie industry from its newly invented competitor - television.Widescreen Museum
Charles Skouras became president of Fox Coast West. In a late 1950s suit, Samuel Goldwyn claimed that Twentieth Century-Fox, Fox West Coast Theatres, National Theatres, Charles P. Skouras, and several affiliated circuits including T & D. Junior Enterprises had intentionally discriminated against independently-produced films, and he sought compensation for years of perceived oppression. Charles died before the trial took place.
George Skouras became president of United Artists Theatres. In 1952 George joined United Artists with Michael Todd and Joe Schenck, former president of Twentieth Century Fox, in order to form the Magna Theatre Corporation for production and distribution of Todd-AO films.

[[Grade I listed buildings in Wiltshire]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of Grade I listed buildings in England by county, Grade I listed buildings in Wiltshire, Wiltshire-related lists

In the United Kingdom, the process of designating a building as meriting protection for its historic significance is known as 'listing'.  At present, there is a parallel system for ancient monuments, known as 'scheduling', which means that there is not a consistent approach to sites like castles, abbeys and henges which can be listed, scheduled or both.  Should the draft Heritage Protection Bill become law, the systems will be merged into a single Register of Historic Buildings and Sites of England,http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/hrp_whitepaper_doc1.pdf Government white paper (PDF). which will also subsume various other existing registers.  In England, the listing is administered by English Heritage, an agency of the government's Department for Culture, Media & Sport — under the new legislation they will become officially responsible for the designation.
Buildings of outstanding architectural or historic interest are listed at Grade I — of the approximately 372,905 listed buildings in England, over 9,000 (2.5%) are Grade I.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/|title=Listed Buildings|year=2010|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=26 August 2011[/tpl]  Estimates to the numbers of buildings do, however, vary given that listings are for what are structurally separate buildings: therefore a street of houses can be listed as one building, but a church wall can be listed separately from the church.  Some buildings are listed for group value.
This list is of the nearly 300 Grade I listed buildings in the ceremonial county of Wiltshire,http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/AdvancedSearch/default.aspx?pid=2 Images of Englandhttp://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Advanced_Search.aspx?reset=true English Heritage Gateway by former district.Wiltshire became a unitary authority in April 2009, alongside Swindon, so these districts are historic  There is a characteristically large contribution from Church of England (Anglican) parish churches, and several great English country houses are included with some of their landscaping features.

[[John Pollexfen]]

CATEGORIES: 1636 births, 1715 deaths, Chief Justices of the Common Pleas, English economists, English merchants, 17th-century English people, English MPs 1680–81, English MPs 1681, English MPs 1689–90, English MPs 1690–95

His Worship John Pollexfen, JP (1636–1715) was a British merchant and political economist. He was the second son of Andrew Pollexfen of Stancombe Dawney in Sherford, Devon, and the younger brother of Henry Pollexfen, who inherited the family estates, leading to strained relations between the brothers. John's early career as a merchant began with trading in wines from the Iberian Peninsula, leading to a summons to the Treasury on 28 March 1677 to report on Portuguese wines. In the same year he bought Walbrooke House, in the parish of St Stephen Walbrook, and in 1686 he purchased the manor of Wembury. In 1675 he served on the Committee on Trade and Plantations, followed by an appointment in 1678 to the Privy Chamber in 1678, which he held until 1685; he was again appointed in 1690, and remained until 1702. He was appointed to the Commission for Preventing the Export of Wool in 1689, resigning in 1692.
He was returned to parliament for Plympton Erle in October 1679, and again for the parliaments of 1681, 1689 and 1690. He was active on various economic affairs committees, helping pass the Tobacco Act and renew the charter of the East India Company. He was made a Justice of the Peace for Devon in 1689 and an honorary trustee of the National Land Bank. His most significant appointment was as a member of the Board of Trade between 1696 until 23 April 1709. While there he participated in the recoinage debate, produced a report on the judicial system of Barbados and advocated a unified military command for the American colonies. In 1677 he served on a special commission of the East India Company, accusing the directors of monopolising the trade through jobbery and refusing to issue new stock, and also condemned the export of gold bullion, which he saw as suppressing domestic production and employment. As a result he lobbied the House of Commons in 1689 to establish a new, national company, and presented written and oral testimony to the House of Lords in 1696 showing the harmful effects of importing Indian-manufactured goods and exporting bullion. In response the Lords and Commons opened up the trade lanes to India, establishing a well-regulated company to manage this.
As a by-product of his public career Pollexfen published a series of political and economic essays. After Charles Davenant published his An Essay on the East India Trade in 1697, Pollexfen responded with his essay England and East India Inconsistent in their Manufactures, and also published A Discourse of Trade and Coyn dated 15 July 1696,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3ngEugMMa9YC&pg=PA618&lpg=PA618&dq=%22John+Pollexfen%22+-bastard&source=web&ots=rB3uPgrJtP&sig=OmUCW-oYqyM4-yvxGJXqZSkPhc8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result|title=Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton|last=Westfall|first=Richard|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2008-12-03[/tpl] an extended version of which was republished to counter William Lowndes proposal of recoinage.

[[Ocean surface topography]]

CATEGORIES: Climatology, Oceanography, Topography

The ocean surface has highs and lows, similar to the hills and valleys of Earth's land surface depicted on a topographic map. These variations, called "ocean surface topography" or "dynamic sea surface topography" are mapped using measurements of sea surface height relative to Earth's geoid. Earth's geoid is a calculated surface of equal gravitational potential energy and represents the shape the sea surface would be if the ocean were not in motion. 
The height variations of ocean surface topography can be as much as two meters and are influenced  by ocean circulation, ocean temperature, and salinity.
Ocean surface topography is used to map  ocean currents, which move around the ocean's "hills" and "valleys" in predictable ways. A clockwise sense of rotation is found around "hills" in the northern hemisphere and "valleys" in the southern hemisphere. This is because of the Coriolis effect. Conversely, a counterclockwise sense of rotation is found around "valleys" in the northern hemisphere and "hills" in the southern hemisphere.[tpl]cite web | url = http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/education/tutorial2.html | title = Ocean Surface Topography from Space | publisher = NASA/JPL[/tpl]
Ocean surface topography is also used to understand how the ocean moves heat around the globe, a critical component of Earth's climate, and for monitoring changes in global  sea level.
Ocean surface topography can be derived from ship-going measurements of temperature and salinity at depth. However, since 1992, a series of  satellite altimetry missions, beginning with TOPEX/Poseidon and continued with Jason-1 and the Ocean Surface Topography Mission on the Jason-2 satellite have measured sea surface height directly. By combining these measurements with gravity measurements from NASA's  Grace mission, scientists can determine sea surface topography to within a few centimeters.
A new satellite mission called the Surface Water Ocean Topography Mission has been proposed to make the first global survey of the topography of all of Earth's surface water--the ocean, lakes and rivers.  This study is aimed to provide a comprehensive view of Earth’s freshwater bodies from space and more much detailed measurements of the ocean surface than ever before.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/features/200809-1b.html|title= Following the Water with the Ocean Surface Topography Mission [/tpl]

Namibia's telephone numbering plan was originally devised when the country, then known as South West Africa, was under South African administration, and integrated into the South African telephone numbering plan.
Area codes beginning with 06 were  allocated to Namibia, including Walvis Bay, a South African exclave, which was not transferred to Namibian sovereignty until 1994.
Following Namibia's independence in 1990, direct dialing between Namibia and South Africa was discontinued, and calls were classed as international. Consequently, subscribers were required to use the international access code and country calling code, omitting the trunk code 0.

CATEGORIES: Defunct law firms of the United States, Law firms based in New York City, Law firms established in 1914, 2001 disestablishments, Defunct companies based in New York

Brown & Wood was a New York-based law firm established in 1914 that merged with Chicago-based Sidley & Austin in 2001 to form Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, later shortened to Sidley Austin. 
The firm was known for its expertise in capital markets work, specifically the representation of issuers and underwriters in securities offerings. According to Securities Data Co., Brown & Wood was ranked first in both issuers and underwriters representation in 1998, and first as legal adviser on securitized debt issues in the same year. Brown & Wood also cultivated a roster of clients in the real estate investment trust, defense of brokerage firms and international securities offerings, among other areas.
The firm had offices in New York, Beijing, Hong Kong, London (1989), Los Angeles (1971), San Francisco (1986) and Washington, D.C. (1980) as well as a representative office in Tokyo. In 1986, the firm absorbed Tufo & Zuccotti, the firm of former New York City Deputy Mayor John Zuccotti and Peter Tufo, ex Davis Polk & Wardwell attorneys (though Tufo himself did not join Brown & Wood).
Brown & Wood made headlines in 1988 when it famously de-equitized and fired a partner who it accused of poor performance. The attorney, a graduate of Dartmouth College and New York University School of Law was given $120,000 severance pay and was later reduced to driving a limousine. He sued the firm but lost. The presiding judge, Judge Harold Baer Jr. wrote in his opinion, "Many believe that the last decade has seen the bar move from a profession to a business. In some firms we find that profits have replaced pro bono; production has undercut professionalism and compensation has overtaken collegiality" (see: book of business (law).Margolick, David. "The Law: At the Bar", The New York Times, May 13, 1988. 
Typical of the old-line Wall Street law firms, many of which have since disappeared or merged with out-of-town rivals, Brown & Wood was considered a cordial, if stuffy, work environment. According to the The Insider's Guide to Law Firms published in 1993, formal suits were required and "some summer associates Brown & Wood have been asked questions about the number they owned and about their underclothes."Margolick, David. "At the Bar", The New York Times, October 8, 1993.
In an effort to bulk up in a period of strong law firm consolidation, Brown & Wood explored a merger with fellow New York firm White & Case in 1998, but these talks were described as "preliminary in nature." Brown & Wood eventually merged with Sidley & Austin in 2001. Shortly thereafter, the legacy Brown & Wood's offices in the World Trade Center were destroyed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Schwartz, David. "Up from the Ashes, One Firm Rebuilds", The New York Times, September 16, 2001. The firm relocated its New York operations to midtown Manhattan.

[[Disclosure of the invention under the European Patent Convention]]

Article 83 of the European Patent Convention (EPC)[tpl]EPC Article|83[/tpl] relates to the disclosure of the invention under the European Patent Convention. It prescribes that a European patent application must disclose the invention (which is the subject of the European patent application) in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. 
In order to meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC, a European patent application must therefore contain sufficient information to allow a person skilled in the art, using his common general knowledge, to perceive the technical teaching inherent in the claimed invention and to put it into effect accordingly. Decision G 2/93 of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office dated December 21, 1994, Reasons 4. In other words, the disclosure of the invention must be reproducible without undue burden. Decision T 63/06 of 24 June 2008, reasons 2.2, ".. according to the well established case law of the Boards of Appeal .. the disclosure must be reproducible without undue burden." See also [tpl]EPO Case law book|ii|c|5|6[/tpl] This requirement must be complied with as from the date of filing because a deficiency in a European patent application as filed, consisting in an insufficient identification of the subject-matter claimed, cannot subsequently be cured without offending against Article 123(2) EPC which provides that the subject-matter content of a European patent application as filed may not be extended.

The ''Balilla''-class were the first submarines to be built for the Italian navy following the end of World War I. They were large ocean-going cruiser submarines designed to operate in the Indian Ocean based in Italy's East African colonies. The design was double-hulled and based on the German Type UE 2 U-boats, one of which, U-120 was supplied to the Italians as a war reparation. A [tpl]convert|425|hp[/tpl] auxiliary diesel engine was installed as an extra generator.
The boats were stationed in the Mediterranean in 1940 but proved too large to be effective patrol submarines. Their only success was the sinking of the British submarine HMS Triad by Enrico Toti on 15 October 1940. After 1941 they were used as transport submarines to supply Italian forces in North Africa. The surviving boats were scrapped after the war.

Learning for a Cause aimed to increase and strengthen the social and moral sensibilities in high school students by providing them with genuine opportunities to engage as citizens. The flagship project of the initiative was the Publishing Program which allowed Canadian high school students to write and publish on REAL issues in REAL books and thereby inspire REAL change in their communities and indeed their world. More than 1500 high school students were published and made authors through this award-winning initiative.
More noted publications include Down to Earth, http://www.trafford.com/07-2868 a collection of more than 100 high school students writing in response to global warming and environmental destruction. The volume featured guest writers Roberta Bondar and Justin Trudeau. Down to Earth was endorsed by a number of celebrities including Martin Sheen, David Suzuki, Farley Mowat and Marc Garneau. Columbia University Philosopher Maxine Greene has said that the project "is a significant opening to possibility" and legendary Canadian artist Robert Bateman added that "Learning for a Cause is what every young person should be doing." Down to Earth was a finalist in two categories at the 2009 World Indie Book Awards.
Other publications include Raising Humanity, which features introductions by Emmy-award-winning actor Martin Sheen and Canada's First Astronaut Marc Garneau.

Zionist Socialist Workers Party ([tpl]lang-ru|Сионистско-социалистическая рабочая партия[/tpl]), often referred to simply as 'Zionist-Socialists' or 'S.S.' by their Russian initials, was a Jewish socialist territorialist political party in the Russian Empire and Poland, that emerged from the Vozrozhdenie (Renaissance) group in 1904. The party held its founding conference in Odessa in 1905.Alroey, Gur. Demographers in the service of the nation: Liebmann Hersch, Jacob Lestschinsky, and the early study of Jewish migration, Jewish History (2006) 20:265–282http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1912/jun/17d.htmhttp://www.zchor.org/plock/sefer2.htm
In the same year the party sent delegates, among them Nachman Syrkin, to the Basle Seventh Zionist Congress.[tpl]cite book|last=Frankel|first=Jonathan|title=Prophecy and politics: socialism, nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|pages=686|isbn=978-0-521-26919-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-ycwctuCSpQC[/tpl] However, while the mainstream Zionist movement rejected the idea of a Jewish state anywhere but in Eretz Yisrael, the Russian party favoured the idea of a Jewish territorial autonomy, outside of Palestine.Ėstraĭkh, G. In Harness: Yiddish Writers' Romance with Communism. Judaic traditions in literature, music, and art. Syracuse, New York: Syracuse University Press, 2005. p. 30 Moreover, whilst territorial autonomy was the goal of the party, it dedicated most of its energy into revolutionary activities in Russia. Like other Russian revolutionary groups such as the Narodniks, the party was positive towards using terrorism as a means of struggle against the establishment.Geifman, Anna. Thou Shalt Kill: Revolutionary Terrorism in Russia, 1894–1917. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1993. p. 35
Nachman Syrkin, Jacob Lestschinsky, Volf Latsky-Bartoldi and Shmuel Niger were amongst the leading figures of the party.Frankel, Jonathan (ed.). The Jews and the European crisis, 1914–1921. New York: Oxford University Press, 1988. p. 339
The party played an active role in the 1905 revolution.
At the 7th congress of the World Zionist Organization in 1905, the WZO formally rejected the 'Uganda Plan' (a proposal to resettle Jews in East Africa) after sharp debates. In response, the party and other territorialists withdrew from the WZO.
The party grew rapidly, and became the second largest Jewish labour party after the Bund. The party organized 'neutral' trade unions, in opposition to the Bundist unions. In the end of 1906, the party claimed a membership of 27 000. However, after 1906 the influence of the party began to decline sharply. Many leaders went into exile in Western Europe.  The central organ of the party was the weekly Yiddish newspaper Der nayer veg, published from Vilna 1906–1907. The newspaper was closed down by the authorities in 1907.http://www.yivoinstitute.org/pdf/newspapers_periodicals.pdf
During the 1907 Stuttgart congress of the Second International, the International Socialist Bureau decided to give a consultative vote to the party at the congress. The decision was, however, overturned a year later.Frankel, Jonathan. Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981. p. 283Jacobs, Jack Lester. Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe: The Bund at 100. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001. p. 185
In 1911 party, the Jewish Socialist Workers Party and Poalei Zion signed a joint appeal to the International Socialist Bureau, asking the International to recognize the national character of the Jewish people.
In 1917 the party merged with the Jewish Socialist Workers Party, forming the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party.Jaff Schatz. Jews and the communist movement in interwar Poland.

Falling Down is a 1993 crime drama film directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Ebbe Roe Smith. The film stars Michael Douglas in the lead role of William Foster, a divorcé and unemployed former defense engineer. The film centers on Foster as he goes on a violent rampage across the city of Los Angeles, trying to reach the house of his estranged ex-wife in time for his daughter's birthday party. Along the way, a series of encounters, both trivial and provocative, cause him to react with violence and make sardonic observations on life, poverty, the economy, and commercialism. Robert Duvall co-stars as Martin Prendergast, an aging LAPD Sergeant on the day of his retirement, who faces his own frustrations, even as he tracks down Foster.
The title of the film, referring to Foster's mental collapse, is taken from the nursery rhyme "London Bridge is Falling Down", which is a recurring motif throughout the film.

[[Sagmatias]]

CATEGORIES: Oceanic dolphins

Sagmatias is a genus that has been proposed for certain dolphin species that are currently placed in the genus Lagenorhynchus.  Mitochondrial DNA studies have indicated that certain dolphin species within Lagenorhynchus are actually more closely related to dolphins within the genus Cephalorhynchus.  In order to resolve this situation it has been proposed that the affected dolphin species be placed within the genus Sagmatias.[tpl]cite journal|title=Phylogenetic Relationships among the Delphinid Cetaceans Based on Full Cytochrome B Sequences|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119937779/abstract|author=Leduc, R., Perrin, W. & Dizon, E.|date=August 18, 1998|journal=Marine Mammal Science|volume=15|issue=3|pages=619–648|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1999.tb00833.x|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl]  Affected species are:
In addition, there is evidence that the Hourglass Dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) should also be placed within the new genus, although the evidence for this species is less conclusive.[tpl]cite book|title=Whales, Dolphins and Other Marine Mammals of the World|author=Shirihai, H. and Jarrett, B.|publisher=Princeton Field Guides|year=2006|pages=207–208|isbn=0-61-12757-2[/tpl]

[[Treschow (noble family)]]

CATEGORIES: Norwegian families, Norwegian nobility, Patriciate of Norway, Norwegian-language surnames

Treschow (originally Træskomager) is the name of a Danish and Norwegian family, the name of which is derived from the profession of its ancestor, "wooden shoe maker".
A member of the family, Michael Treschow, was in 1812 ennobled by letters patent, wherefore this branch of the family became a part of the untitled nobility of Denmark and Norway; however, the concept of nobility is no longer officially recognized in Norway, following the adoption of the 1821 Nobility Law. Members of this family have been merchants and landowners, notably in Vestfold. The family is not known to be related to a different Treschow family living in Norway. The family is also unrelated to the noble German Tresckow family; however, the family adopted a coat of arms based on the coat of arms of the German family in the 19th century. The name Treschow is used also by some persons who are not patrilineal descendants of the family and thus not members of the family that was considered as noble.

Little Ashes is a 2008 Spanish-British drama film set against the backdrop of Spain during the 20s and 30s, as three of the era's most creative young talents meet at university and set off on a course to change their world. Luis Buñuel watches helplessly as the friendship between Salvador Dalí and the poet Federico García Lorca develops into a love affair.
The detail of the relationship between artist Salvador Dalí and poet Federico Garcia Lorca has long been the subject of speculation and debate amongst historians and biographers.

Before Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Conquistadors landed on the island of "Borikén" (Puerto Rico), the Tainos who inhabited the island depended on their astronomical observations for the cultivation of their crops.
In 1581, Juan Ponce de León II, the grandson of the Conquistador Juan Ponce de León, studied an eclipse and its effects on the island and was able to establish the exact geographical coordinates of San Juan with his observations.
During the 19th century the economies of many countries in the world suffered from the spread of crop failures. Puerto Rico, whose economy depended heavily on its agriculture, felt the effects of some of the crop diseases. Scientists such as Dr. Agustín Stahl, Fermín Tangüis and Fernando López Tuero conducted investigations and experiments in the fields of agriculture, botany, ethnology and zoology. The findings of their investigations helped Puerto Rico's agricultural industry.
With the advances in medical technologies and the coming of the Space Age of the 20th century, Puerto Ricans have expanded their horizons and have made many contributions in various scientific fields, among them the fields of aerospace and medicine.
There are many Puerto Rican scientists involved in the American space program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). According to an article written by Margarita Santori Lopez for the official newspaper of the University of Puerto Rico's Mayagüez Campus, "Prensa RUM", as of 2003, of the 115 Hispanics working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, 70 were Puerto Ricans or of Puerto Rican descent. According to a research conducted during the period of 1990 to 1998 by Puerto Rican scientists in science and technology, Puerto Rican scientific production was greater than in any other Caribbean country and the sixth largest in all of Latin America.Scientific Production in Puerto Rico in Science and Technology during the Period 1990 to 1998
The following is a list of some of Puerto Rico's notable scientists and inventors with short profiles that include the scientific contributions, inventions and achievements in their respective fields. The list is not limited to people born in Puerto Rico, it also includes people who are of full or partial Puerto Rican ancestry, and many long-term residents and who have made Puerto Rico their home, and who are recognized for their life and/or work.

Elias Petropoulos ([tpl]lang-el|Ηλίας Πετρόπουλος[/tpl]; 1928–2003), who was born in Greece but spent much of his life in France, holds a unique place in the intellectual life of Europe.  A self-described "urban anthropologist," he wrote widely and seriously on aspects of Greek life which were rarely considered objects of serious study:  the design of the ubiquitous balconies, courtyards, ironwork, and windows of Greek buildings, the methods and vocabulary of preparing coffee and the art of telling fortunes from coffee-grounds, the traditional layout and functioning of brothels, the role of bean soup as an unheralded Greek national dish, the specialized slang of the Greek homosexual scene — it is claimed that his book Kaliarda (Καλιαρντά) was the first dictionary of gay slang in any language — the Greek drug users' underworld, and above all, the Greek musical form rebetiko, of which he was certainly the major historian.  His major work, Rebetika Traghoudhia, extensively documents the lyrics and  instrumentation of this music, as well as the lifestyle associated with it.  The publication of the first edition of this book in Greece in 1968 so scandalized the ruling dictatorship that he was jailed for five months.
  Subsequent controversial books he authored resulted in several more jail sentences and fines, resulting ultimately in his decision to leave Greece to live permanently in France.

A T-head engine is an early type of internal combustion engine that became obsolete after World War I.
It is a sidevalve engine that is distinguished from the much more common L-head by its placement of the valves.  The intake valves are on one side of the engine block and the exhaust valves on the other.  Seen from the end of the crankshaft, in cutaway view, the cylinder and combustion chamber resembles a T - hence the name "T-head".  An L-head has all valves at the same side.

Tropical Storm Julio  in 2002 was a weak and short-lived tropical storm that made landfall along the southern Mexican coast. An area of convection organized into a tropical depression on September 25. Initially forecast to stay offshore, the depression headed northward and strengthened into a tropical storm that same day. Julio turned to the northwest and peaked as a minimal tropical storm just before landfall near Lázaro Cárdenas, on September 26. The storm soon weakened into a tropical depression and later on September 26, it rapidly dissipated over Mexico.
Prior to making landfall, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for a portion of the Pacific coast of Mexico. After making landfall, three fatalities and 18 injuries were reported from Julio when a bus flipped over. Around 100 houses in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were damaged or washed away by flash flooding. In the latter city, many trees were brought down and numerous streets were flooded. The highest rainfall reported was [tpl]convert|16.10|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] at Zihuatanejo and La Unión, resulting in devastation. In all, about 2,000 homes were flooded while 100 families were evacuated. About a month after Julio, Hurricane Kenna affected some of the same locations as Julio.

Hurricane Norman was the most recent tropical system to make landfall in California. The 14th named storm, 11th hurricane and 6th major hurricane of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season, Norman evolved from a tropical disturbance noted [tpl]convert|400|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] southeast of Acapulco on the afternoon of August 29. The system moved westward and developed into a tropical depression on August 30. Modest strengthening ensued, and the cyclone became a tropical storm that evening and a hurricane on the evening of August 31 as it turned to the west-northwest. Late on the night of September 1, Norman became a major hurricane with a 40-mile wide eye, and a nearby ship reported seas of [tpl]convert|41|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The center grazed the northeast side of Socorro Island on the afternoon of September 2. Moving over cooler waters west of Baja California, the cyclone slowly weakened. By early on September 4, moisture from the hurricane spread north into California initiating rains in the Golden State. A developing trough to its west caused the initial influx of moisture and Norman's turn to the north as a weakening tropical storm. Eventually turning north-northeast towards southern California, the cyclone did eventually turn north-northeast towards southern California, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression as it passed the 30th parallel. Hurricane Norman made landfall in California on September 5, as a minimal tropical depression. The tropical cyclone became a remnant low shortly after California landfall, and the final advisory was issued at 00:00 GMT, on September 6. Over [tpl]convert|7.01|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of rain occurred in the Sierra Nevada range.[tpl]cite web|title=Hurricane Norman - August 30-September 6|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/norman1978.html|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl] Rare snowfall was also reported.

Ole Hovelsen Mustad (1810–1884) was a Norwegian businessperson and politician. He was instrumental in shaping the company O. Mustad & Søn, and served one term in the Norwegian Parliament.
He was born in Vardal[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Mustad, Ole (Hovelsen) |encyclopedia=Aschehoug og Gyldendals Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |url=http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=686495 [/tpl] as the son of Kari Tollefsdatter Bjørnstad (1782–1858) and her second husband Haavel Eriksen Kaas (1784–1849).[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Mustad |encyclopedia=Aschehoug og Gyldendals Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |url=http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=686490 [/tpl]
In 1843 he took over the company Brusveen Spiger- og Staaltraadfabrikk, founded by his father-in-law Hans Schikkelstad in 1832. It was located along the river Hunnselva in Vardal. Upon the takeover, Ole Mustad changed the name of the company to O. Mustad. He gradually expanded from wire and nail production to running a foundry and a sawmill. In 1874 his son Hans Mustad became co-owner, and the company name was changed to O. Mustad & Søn. The nail production was moved to Kristiania in 1876; instead the factory at Vardal started specializing in fish hook production.Timeline - Mustad.noHistory - Mustad Eiendom The company eventually became the world's largest producer of fish hooks.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Mustad & Søn AS, O. |encyclopedia=Aschehoug og Gyldendals Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |url=http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=686497 [/tpl]

He only served one term.Ole Hovelsen Mustad — Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD) Ole Mustad was also the local police sergeant (lensmann) in Vardal from 1834 to 1857.
He died in 1884, only years before the company started expanding abroad. The company was eventually passed on to the five sons of Hans Mustad, who had been co-owners since 1905. Another of Ole Mustad's sons, Kristian Mauritz Mustad (1848–1913), became involved in national politics and worked as a jurist; so did his son Sigbjørn Mustad (1897–1970).

In 1948, he became the United States' second Olympic men's basketball coach.  Browning led the team to a final record of 8-0 en route to a gold medal in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Browning became the winningest coach in AAU tournament history when his teams won championships in 1962 and 1963.
He performed as a player in the AAU from 1935 to 1943, but achieved his greatest fame as a coach for the Phillips 66ers, leading them to five consecutive AAU national titles from 1944 to 1948, and to two more titles in 1962 and 1963.
Browning first achieved name recognition in the AAU in 1935, when he helped lead the Southern Kansas Stage Lines win the national championship over the McPherson Oil Refiners, 45-26. He was selected for the AAU All-American (all-star) team. The following year, playing for the Santa Fe Trailways team of Kansas City, he again was named All-American helping to take Santa Fe to third place over the Hutchinson Western Transits, 35-33.
The following year, Browning was recruited by the Phillips 66ers, who after a lapse of several years, reconstituted a new team to compete in the 1937 AAU championship. Browning joined such players as Joe Fortenberry, Jack Ragland, Chuck Hyatt, and Tom Pickell. The next two years the team took second in the national tournament, losing to the Denver Safeway Stores both times in the title game. Finally, in 1940, Browning played on his second national championship team, as the Phillips 66ers took their first AAU title, beating their nemesis the Denver team, now known as the Nuggets, in the title game, 39-36. In 1941, he played on the Phillips 66ers third place team, and in 1942 on the second place team.
In 1943, Browning helped the Phillips 66ers win their second national AAU title. The following year, he was named player-coach for the 66ers, and went on to an even more famous career as a coach. After winning five consecutive titles as first player-coach and then coach of the Phillips 66ers, in 1948 he became the United States's second Olympic men's basketball coach. Browning led the team to a final record of 8-0 en route to a gold medal in the 1948 Olympics in London, England.
Browning retired from coaching after 1948, but came back and coached the Phillips 66ers for one year in 1954. The team was not a factor in the AAU tournament.  Browning returned to coaching the Phillips 66ers in 1959. Browning also coached the Phillips 66ers in the National Alliance of Basketball Leagues, and led them to two more AAU championships, in 1962 and 1963.
In 1957 Browning was named to the Helms Amateur Basketball Hall of fame.

[[Fascist and anti-Fascist violence in Italy (1919–26)]]

CATEGORIES: Italian fascism

Italy witnessed significant widespread civil unrest and political strife in the aftermath of World War I and the rise of the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini which opposed the rise of the international left, especially the far-left along with others who opposed Fascism. Fascists and communists fought on the streets during this period as the two factions competed to gain power in Italy. The already tense political environment in Italy escalated into major civil unrest when Fascists began attacking their rivals, beginning on April 15, 1919 with Fascists attacking the offices of the Italian Socialist Party's newspaper Avanti!.Smith, Dennis Mack (1997) Modern Italy; A Political History, Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1997, ISBN 0-472-10895-6, pp298 
Violence grew in 1921 with Italian army officers beginning to assist the Fascists with their violence against communists and socialists.Smith, 1997, pp312 With the Fascist movement growing, anti-fascists of various political allegiances (but generally of the international left) combined into the Arditi del Popolo (People's Militia) in 1921.Berghaus, Günter. 1996.

Two months after Mussolini took over as Prime Minister, Fascists attacked and killed members of the local labour movement in Turin in what became known as the 1922 Turin Massacre.Sonnessa, Antonio. "The 1922 Turin Massacre (Strage di Torino): Working class resistance and conflicts within fascism". Modern Italy, Volume 10, Issue 2 November 2005. Goldsmiths College, University of London, United Kingdom. Pp. 187-205.http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a727181052~db=all~order=page The next act of violence was the assassination of Socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti by Fascist militant Amerigo Dumini in 1924. This was followed by a Fascist takeover of the Italian government and multiple assassination attempts were made against Mussolini in 1926, with the last attempt on October 31, 1926. On November 9, 1926, the Fascist government initiated emergency powers which resulted in the arrest of multiple anti-Fascists including communist Antonio Gramsci. Afterwards serious opposition to the Fascist regime collapsed.

Yizhar Hirschfeld (1950 – 16 November 2006) was an Israeli archaeologist studying Greco-Roman and Byzantine archaeology. He was an associate professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and director of excavations at a number of sites around Israel, including Ramat Hanadiv, Tiberias, and Khirbet ed-Deir. He also published a book on the archaeology of Qumran[tpl]cite book|title=Qumran In Context|author=Yizhar Hirschfeld|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|year=2004[/tpl] in which he proposed an assessment of the site that was contrary to prevailing views.
Professor Hirschfeld was born at Kibbutz Beth Keshet in Israel in 1950. He was already working on an excavation site in 1974 at Emmaus where he acted as excavation and survey director. From 1984 to 1987 he directed digs at Ramat HaNadiv. He received his doctorate at the Hebrew University Institute of Archaeology in 1987 and the following year he was awarded a Rothschild fellowship. He returned to Ramat Hanadiv in 1989, the year he also started work on excavations at Tiberias. In 1998 he was appointed as associate professor at the Hebrew University.
From 1996-2002 Hirschfeld directed excavations at a site on a terrace overlooking Ein Gedi, which consisted of a series of small dwellings. His analysis led him to conclude that "all features of the site--its location above Ein Gedi, simplicity, and unique nature--conform to Pliny the Elder's (d. 79 A.D.) famous passage on the Essenes". His proposal on the site (compare Aharoni 1958 BIES) has found little acceptance among archaeologists.as stated in a paper at the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Associated Literature at the Hebrew University in 1998Both before 1948 (e.g., C.D. Ginsberg 1862, Proceedings of the Liverpool Literary & Philosophical Society p. 202; Christian Friedrich Lebrecht Strack, "Südlich von ihnen lag sonst die Stadt Engadda..." in Cajus Plinius Secundus Naturgeschichte (ed. Max Strack;; Bremen: Johan Georg Hense, 1853; MEG Rey 1861 p.219f and others) and after 1948, many others interpreted Pliny as locating Ein Gedi south of the Essenes. Archaeologically, see "Not a Settlement of Hermits or Essenes: A Response to Y. Hirschfeld, A settlement of Hermits above En Gedi" by David Amit and Jodi Magness, Tel Aviv 27 (2000) 273-91.
The experience he gained working on Greco-Roman period rural settlements gave him the background to write his controversial book Qumran In Context (2004), in which he concluded on morphological grounds that Qumran was "a Judean manor house" [tpl]cite book|title=Qumran In Context|author=Yizhar Hirschfeld|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|year=2004[/tpl] p.226 (and thus not the home of Essenes).

"Hiawatha (A Summer Idyl)" is a popular song written by Neil Moret (Charles N. Daniels) in 1901. James O'Dea added lyrics in 1903 and the music was re-subtitled "(His Song to Minnehaha)".
"Hiawatha" was extremely popular when released, and sold half a million copies.Jasen, Tin Pan Alley, p. 102: "In 1901, Daniels published his Indian song, 'Hiawatha,' which became a success after Daniels prevailed upon Sousa to perform and record it (Victor 2443). The following year, when Jerome Remick purchased Whitney Warner of Detroit, he paid Daniels $10,000 for his firm so that Remick could have 'Hiawatha.' It was the highest sum yet paid for a song."Sanjek, American Popular Music and Its Business, p. 414. "500,000". It has been recorded numerous times and started a decade long fad for "Indian" songs.Jasen, Tin Pan Alley, p. 102: "The following year, James O'Dea added words to 'Hiawatha,' and sales zoomed again when it became a song. Thus started the trend of Indian songs, which were extremely popular during the first decade of the twentieth century."
"Hiawatha" was named for Hiawatha, Kansas, not for Longfellow's poem.Parlor Songs 1800-1920. "The song was originally written around 1900 by Moret as an instrumental work as a tribute to a town in Kansas (Hiawatha, Kansas) where his sweetheart lived."

[[Charles Mitchell Thomas]]

CATEGORIES: 1846 births, 1908 deaths, People from Pennsylvania, United States Navy admirals

Charles Mitchell Thomas (October 1, 1846–July 3, 1908) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy who served for 47 years. He was briefly the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet while it was in port at San Francisco on the tour of the Great White Fleet. He was born in Philadelphia and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1865. He married Ruth Simpson, daughter of Admiral Edward Simpson, on November 3, 1874.
In mid-1877, unrest over economic conditions and the disputed 1876 Presidential election, led to a series of railroad strikes and riots known as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. In July, President Rutherford B. Hayes authorized the use of the military to put down the strikes. During the conflict, Thomas was given temporary command of the receiving ship USS St. Louis stationed at League Island near Philadelphia. He provided sailors to the USS Glance and USS Pilgrim which were used in the defense of the Frankford Arsenal in northeast Philadelphia.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Naval Brigade and the Marine Battalions in the Labor Strikes of 1877|work=United Service|last=C.|first=H. C.|date=October 1879|pages=630–631|volume=1|issue=4[/tpl]
As a lieutenant commander he commanded the USC&GS Carlile P. Patterson from 1887 to 1889 for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, mapping out portions of the Alaska coast and naming prominent features in the south-east of the state. Thomas Bay, which he surveyed, was named in his honor.[tpl]cite book|title=Geographic Dictionary of Alaska|last=Baker|first=Marcus|edition=2nd|year=1906|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Government Printing Office|page=69[/tpl]
During the sailing of the Great White Fleet, Thomas was second-in-command behind Admiral Evans. Shortly after the launch of the first leg, Evans fell ill and Thomas served in his stead at diplomatic functions during the cruise. Beginning in February 1908, Thomas was officially made acting-Commander-in-Chief when Evans was transported to San Francisco for treatment. On May 9, 1908 Evans was formally replaced by Thomas as Commander-in-Chief. Five days later, Thomas retired from active duty and command was transferred to Admiral Charles S. Sperry for the second leg of the voyage.

CATEGORIES: Richmond, British Columbia, Flags of cities in British Columbia

The flag of Richmond, British Columbia depicts a field of gold surrounded by a thick blue border. In the centre of the field is a shield (the escutcheon of the coat of arms of the city of Richmond), depicting three Pacific Salmon fish on a light blue wave running vertically down the shield.
Municipal Council first asked staff to prepare a report on the design of a civic flag on July 22, 1985.  Council minutes of April 14, 1986 indicate that “the Municipal Flag had been officially introduced to the public at the opening of Brighouse Park on Saturday, April 12, 1986.”  This is much later than the adoption of the coat of arms, which occurred on November 10, 1979, the centenary of incorporation of the municipality.
The design of the flag is based on Richmond’s Coat of Arms.  The official description of the Coat of Arms as used in the program for the Coat of Arms Presentation Ceremony of Nov. 10, 1979 identifies blue and gold as the “accepted colours for Richmond.”  The inner design of the flag represents the shield on the coat of arms. The statement of significance of the Coat of Arms states: “The shield is coloured gold, with the wavy pale bar in blue, and three Pacific Salmon thereon in natural colour – silver. The blue bar represents the Fraser River and the delta waters that surround Richmond.  The salmon are representative of the most common species that abound in the waters around the municipality.  The salmon relate also to the strong historic and continuing association with the fishing industry, responsible for the early prosperity and growth of the community and very much evident in the present day economy of Richmond.”

[[Canoe orienteering]]
CATEGORIES: Orienteering, Canoeing

 
Canoe orienteering (canoe-O) is an orienteering sport using a canoe, kayak, or other small boat.  Usually, a canoe-O is a timed race in which one- or two-person boats start at staggered intervals, are timed, and are expected to perform all navigation on their own.  Portages are allowed.  The control points, shown on an orienteering map, may be visited in any order.  Standings are determined first by successful completion of the course, then by shortest time on course.
Canoe-O is best done in a body of water with many small islands and a complex shoreline.  Frequently, two-person teams compete using one canoe.  Some control points are accessible by water and others by land.  Route choice is important:  competitors must select both water and land routes so that the controls are encountered efficiently, and neither team member wastes time waiting for the other.
Canoe-O has no international sports governing body. The United States Canoe Association has held an annual canoe and kayak orienteering championship since 1996 and has offered canoe-O during its national championships since 1992.

Benni Efrat (born 1936) is an Israeli painter, sculptor, printmaker and filmmaker who was born in Beirut.  He immigrated to Palestine in 1947.  From 1959 to 1961, he studied at the Avni Institute of Art and Design in Tel Aviv under Yehezkel Streichman (1906–1993).
From 1966 to 1976, he lived in London, where he studied at Saint Martin's School of Art in London. After working in London, Benni Efrat became the first of the Israeli Conceptual artists and influenced others in this direction (e.g., Joshua Neustein, Michael Gitlin, Buky Schwartz). His works were systems of components which spoke for themselves and sought to represent no more than the sum of their parts. In the mid-1970s his displays were accompanied by films, on the back of which the artist had painted. After settling in New York City in 1976, became involved with conceptual art, producing drawings, prints and photographs that explore energy, space and the perception in sculpture.  Efrat currently lives in Belgium.

Mervyn Napier Waller CMG  OBE  (19 June 1893[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]30 March 1972) was a noted Australian muralist, mosaicist and painter in stained glass and other media.  He is perhaps best known for the mosaics and stained glass for the Hall of Memory at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, completed in 1958.  However, Melbourne has been described as "a gallery of Napier Waller’s work", as eleven monumental murals by Waller are on display in the central business district and at the University of Melbourne’s main campus.
The Australian Dictionary of Biography says his work "was strongly influenced by Pre-Raphaelite and late-nineteenth century British painters; his monumental works show an increasingly classical and calmly formal style, using timeless and heroic figure compositions to express ideas and ideals, sometimes with theosophical or gnostic overtones".

Storm the Streets is the second studio album by the American punk rock band the Riverdales. After a dispute with Lookout! Records, the band signed to Honest Don's Records for this release. It is the only Riverdales album still available from its original label. In the liner notes to Screeching Weasel's Thank You Very Little (2000), Ben Weasel refers to Storm the Streets as a "gem" but admits that the record sold far less than its predecessor, Riverdales (1995). The band broke up with the album's release. "I Accuse My Parents" most likely takes its title from a movie of the same name which was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television show mentioned in the song "I Think About You During the Commercials" from the Riverdales' debut album.
Storm the Streets is being remastered and reissued in 2011 on Fat Wreck Chords but no further details are currently known. The album was mixed from February 24-27, 1997 by Mass Giorgini at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana.

The American Milking Devon is a breed of cattle from the United States. Originally derived from British North Devon cattle brought to North America in the 17th century, the two strains have since diverged significantly. Modern North Devons have been bred to be used almost exclusively for beef production, while American Milking Devons are a multi-purpose animal akin to the stock which first took the transatlantic journey. Despite their name, they are also suited to meat production and to work as draft animals (i.e. oxen). Considered to be one of the oldest and purest breeds of American cattle in existence, American Milking Devons are also exceedingly rare.

[[Matt Belsante]]
CATEGORIES: American singer-songwriters, Songwriters from New Jersey, American crooners, 1984 births, Living people, People from Essex County, New Jersey

Matt Belsante  (IPA: bel-SAN-tay) (born October 5, 1984) is an American big band singer/songwriter based in Nashville, Tennessee. Belsante's music encompasses jazz, pop and swing, reminiscent of the style of the crooners of the 1940s and 1950s.
Matt Belsante grew up listening to old Frank Sinatra records with his Grandfather and consumed a steady diet of John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald at home.
Just out of grade school, Belsante picked up the tenor sax at the age of twelve and became a standard fixture in his middle school and high school jazz bands. He soon found he had a talent for using his voice. By his Senior year at Neuqua Valley High School in Naperville, IL, Belsante had won the prestigious Louis Armstrong Jazz Award in both the vocal and instrumental categories. He was the first student from his school to achieve such a feat.
Belsante taught himself to play the guitar and began composing his own music the summer before he entered Nashville’s Vanderbilt University. Before the first day of class commenced, Billy Adair, Director of the Vanderbilt/Blair School of Music Blair Big Band, had already recruited Matt to sing for the Band. Soon, Matt was directing himself, leading the Dodecaphonics, an all-male a cappella campus group. Belsante graduated from Vanderbilt in 2006 with degrees in Engineering Science and Economics.
Belsante eventually came to the attention of Nashville’s well-heeled music industry following a performance of the Nashville Jazz Orchestra in 2006. That performance landed him a televised appearance as a featured entertainer for the Miss Tennessee Scholarship Pageant 2006, which eventually led him to GreenHill Music, where he recorded an album of Christmas standards for the independent label. That album, released in 2007, quickly became one of the label’s best selling holiday releases that season.
Following the release of "White Christmas," CBL Properties and their advertising agency, KMT Creative Group, tapped the Nashville based audio branding company iV music group to help develop an audio brand for a national campaign advertising CBL's mall properties across the country. iV music group suggested that Belsante become both the voice and the face of the campaign. As a result, Matt was featured in a series of spots on television, radio and internet.
Belsante finished recording his second album, "Blame It On My Youth," in 2008. The album is a series of covers of classic Jazz and Big Band standards, along with an original Belsante composition, "Haven't Got Much". The album was released on the Green Hill Music label in September, 2008.

Negroland or Nigritia,African-Institute - Sudan was a term invented and used by Europeans in colonial times, for an inland region in West African an area described as populated with "Negro people."  The term "Nigritia" was used in 1823 to describe the region by Mercator's Chart.[tpl]cite web|last=Lucas|first=Fielding|title=A General Atlas Containing Distinct Maps Of all the Known Countries in the World, Constructed from the Latest Authority.

The term is probably a direct translation of the Arabic term Bilad Al Sudan meaning "Land of the blacks", corresponding to about the same area. Some of the greatest states of those considered part of Negroland was the Bornu Empire and the Sokoto Caliphate.
After about the 1960s, however, when civil rights started improving for people of African ancestry, the term "Negro" has been widely considered an ethnic slur in English-speaking countries.The Name "Negro": Its Origin and Evil Use

Because it is known only from its fossil vertebrae (and so few of those have been recovered), paleontologists are  not entirely sure of the taxonomy of Bathyspondylus; the family it belongs to is not currently known.Cladistic Analysis of the Plesiosauria (Reptilia: Sauropterygia)Adam Stuart Smith, Supervised by M.

It was also the first Riverdales album to feature drummer Dan Lumley. It was re-released on October 7, 2008 by Asian Man Records, who had also reissued the band's first album Riverdales in 2006. The album was completely re-mixed and re-mastered, including five previously unreleased songs and new artwork. Four of the bonus tracks were totally new and one was a new arrangement and recording of "Mental Retard" (from the Storm the Streets album). Although the reissue was advertised as having re-recorded vocals, Ben Weasel has stated that this is not correct.[tpl]cite web|author=Posted by benweasel at 11:18 AM |url=http://benweasel.mu.nu/archives/275070.php |title=Weasel Manor: Riverdales - Phase 3 |publisher=Benweasel.mu.nu |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2012-03-05[/tpl] The lyrics to the song "Last Stop Tokyo" are printed on the back of the CD insert and was the first time that the Riverdales released any lyrics to the public. Although written by Ben Foster, the song "Wait It Out" was first recorded by The Lillingtons on their 2001 album The Backchannel Broadcast. Since the relationship between Asian Man and all Ben Weasel related music is now severed, the album may be re-issued yet again sometime in the future.

Two sphincters control the exit of feces from the body during an act of defecation, which is the primary function of the anus. These are the internal anal sphincter and the external anal sphincter, which are circular muscles that normally maintain constriction of the orifice and which relaxes as required by normal physiological functioning. The inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer is voluntary. It is located behind the perineum which is located behind the vagina in females and behind the scrotum in males.
With anal sex, the anus can play a role in sexuality.

[[Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey]]
CATEGORIES: Planktology, Geography of the Southern Ocean

thumb|An example of zooplankton - Actinotroch larva of a phoronid worm, otherwise known as horseshoe worms The Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey is a joint project of the CSIRO Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO  and the Australian Antarctic Division,http://www.aad.gov.au/ Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) DEWHA,http://www.environment.gov.au/ Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts to monitor plankton communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans.
Plankton respond rapidly to changes in the ocean environment compared to other marine animals such as fish, birds and mammals, which makes them ideal biological indicators of ecosystem change. 
AusCPR was initiated in 2007 and funding has been secured initially for four years, although it is envisaged that the survey will continue well into the future. 
The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: 
The AusCPR survey uses the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), a device developed by pioneering British marine biologist Sir Alister Hardy. In 1931, this device formed the basis of the ongoing CPR survey of the North Atlantic. This survey is one of the longest running marine biological surveys in the world, and many climate related changes in the plankton have been observed over the past 70 years. 
The design of the CPR has remained fundamentally unchanged over time as the simple yet robust design is a key to its success as an effective plankton sampler. The key to its success as a frequent basin-scale sampler is that the device is towed behind ships of opportunity (SOOPs) unaccompanied by scientists or research staff, making it a cost-effective sampling platform. The CPR is towed at about 10 metres below the surface and for about 450 nautical miles (830 km) per ‘tow’. The plankton enters a small opening in the device and is trapped and preserved between two layers of silk mesh. In the laboratory the silk is unrolled and phytoplankton and zooplankton are counted and identified.
Data generated by the survey will be made freely available according to the  Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)]  http://imos.org.au/ data policy and will provide researchers and policy makers with environmental and climatic indicators on harmful algal blooms, eutrophication, pollution, climate change and fisheries. 
The AusCPR survey will collaborate with sister surveys, the SCAR Southern Ocean Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and the Continuous Plankton Recorder in the North Atlantic.

The Kagu or Cagou (Rhynochetos jubatus) is a crested, long-legged, and bluish-grey bird endemic to the dense mountain forests of New Caledonia. It is the only surviving member of the genus Rhynochetos and the family Rhynochetidae, although a second species has been described from the fossil record. Measuring [tpl]convert|55|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, it has pale grey plumage and bright red legs. Its 'nasal corns' are a unique feature not shared with any other bird. Almost flightless, it spends its time on or near the ground, where it hunts its invertebrate prey, and builds a nest of sticks on the forest floor. Both parents share incubation of single egg, as well as rearing the chick. It has proved vulnerable to introduced predators, and is threatened with extinction.

According to the Torah, the kingdoms of Sodom and Gomorrah were allied with the cities of Admah, Zeboim and Bela. These five cities, also known as the "cities of the plain", were situated on the Jordan River plain in the southern region of the land of Canaan. The plain, which corresponds to the area just north of the modern-day Dead Sea,[tpl]cite web |url=http://topicalbible.org/s/sodom.htm |title=Sodom |last=Smith |first=William |authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer) |date=c. 1863 |work=Smith's Bible Dictionary |accessdate=2011-08-15[/tpl] was compared to the garden of Eden[tpl]Bibleref2c|Genesis|13:10|NIV|Gen.13:10[/tpl] as being a land well-watered and green, suitable for grazing livestock.
Divine judgment by God was then passed upon Sodom and Gomorrah and two neighboring cities, which were completely consumed by fire and brimstone. Neighboring Zoar (Bela) was the only city to be spared. In Abrahamic religions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of divine retribution.Religions of the World, Second Edition: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practises, J.

[[The New Loretta Young Show]]
CATEGORIES: 1960s American television series, 1962 American television series debuts, 1963 American television series endings, CBS network shows, American comedy-drama television series, Television shows set in Connecticut

The New Loretta Young Show, is an American television series, which aired for twenty-six weekly episodes on CBS television from September 24, 1962 to March 18, 1963, features Loretta Young in a combination drama and situation comedy about a free-lance writer in suburban Connecticut named Christine Massey, the widowed mother of seven children. The program is the only one in which Young starred as a recurring character. Her previous anthology series on NBC (1953–1961) placed her in the role of hostess and occasional star. Young is the first star to garner both Academy and Emmy awards, one of a relatively few to make the transition from motion picture to television.
Though it followed the popular The Andy Griffith Show on CBS, The New Loretta Young Show, sponsored by Lever Brothers, proved unable to sustain the needed audience in competition at 10 p.m. Eastern time on Mondays with the ABC medical drama Ben Casey starring Vince Edwards and Sam Jaffe, which entered its second season. NBC fielded David Brinkley's Journal at the same time, reflections of the news correspondent David Brinkley. The New Loretta Young Show was hence quietly dropped at the end of winter in 1963. Young had formed LYL Production Company for the series, an indication that she did not expect a premature end to the program. Norman Foster directed most of the episodes; John London and Ruth Roberts were the producers.http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Stage/2950/US/Comedy/LorettaYoungShowNew.htm[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT[/tpl]
The Massey children include twin sons and five daughters. Actual twins Dack Rambo and Dirk Rambo, then twenty-one, played Peter and Paul, respectively.  The daughters were Celia Kaye as Marnie, Sandy Descher as Judy, Tracy Stratford as Maria, Carol Sydes as Binkie, and Beverly Washburn as Vickie. Washburn appeared earlier in the film Old Yeller.Internet Movie Data Base website: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055693/
James Philbrook, formerly on ABC's The Islanders, which actually aired opposite the original The Loretta Young Show, played Young's romantic interest, magazine publisher Paul Beltzer, who was some ten years her junior. The couple married in the final episode on March 18, 1963, which was entitled "When You Are Near". Several episodes featured the Beltzer character getting accustomed to the idea of becoming a stepfather to seven children.http://www.tv.com/the-new-loretta-young-show/show/3123/summary.html The program also featured a character Haskell, played by Ted Knight.
In the premiere episode entitled "America at Home", a television interview program fictional version of CBS' Person to Person visits the Masseys in their home, but all are missing. The whole family had taken Maria, who had German measles, to a doctor around the corner. When the host comments about their doing everything together, Christine responds that she discouraged "synthetic togetherness" and that parents should encourage individualism and provide a set of moral values by example. Christine also indicates that she cannot be mother and father to the children, only the mother. Her comments bring a deluge of telephone calls to the television station. The episode serves to introduce all of the Masseys to the audience and to provide a glimpse of their life-style and varied personalities. Young allowed her younger son, Peter Lewis, a small role as a guitarist in the first segment.
As with her NBC anthology, Young made short remarks at the beginning and end of each episode in this series too, something other half-hour programs never did. Critics said the comments were often unnecessary, even pretentious, and that the time could have been better utilized within each episodes. Some of the episodes appear disjointed, possibly because of the overlap of such a large cast. In one episode there is a school election and then the psychotic boyfriend of the older daughter, Marnie, is shown waving a pistol.http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/24405/loretta-young-show-christinas-children-series-the/

[[KKCL]]

CATEGORIES: Radio stations in Lubbock, Texas, Oldies radio stations in the United States, Radio stations established in 1984

KKCL (98.1 FM, "Kool 98") is a radio station broadcasting an oldies format. Licensed to Lorenzo, Texas and serving Lubbock, Texas, USA, the station is currently under ownership of Townsquare Media.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=KKCL |title=KKCL Facility Record |work=United States Federal Communications Commission, audio division[/tpl]
Two applications were filed for the channel that is now used by KKCL. A class A on 98.3 was allocated to Ralls, Texas. One filed for a class A in Ralls and the winner "KB Radio" (partnership of Bryan King and Steve Bumpous) filed for a new station in Lorenzo, Texas (in those days a channel in the FCC table of allotments could be used in the listed city or in an unlisted city within a range of 10–15 miles depending on class of station) which went on as KVOQ in 1984. The station ran round the clock from a studio and tower near the Lubbock (Idalou) Speedway racetrack.
BK arranged to move the station to a new site and adjacent channel for an upgraded signal on 98.1. This new construction permit was sold to Anthony Brandon in 1986, and studios moved to Park Tower at 28th and Avenue Q in Lubbock. The station was variously adult contemporary, easy listening, and finally oldies (with Rush Limbaugh) which finally put it on the map. 
Lew Dee and Diana served as morning show hosts in the 1990s through February 2002. At that point, Lew Dew & Diana and Johnny May left Clear Channel Lubbock for RAMAR Communications. In the Spring of 2002 they started AC station 104.3 Stars FM. The format for the next nine years ended up bouncing around back and forth between 104.3 and 97.3 before being jettisoned for the 97.3 YES FM branding in September 2011.
Rush Limbaugh was moved off of KKCL to sister-station KFYO in 1999. From 1999 through the end of 2000, KFYO tape-delayed Rush Limbaugh from 1p-4p to air a Noon Ag Hour with Jim Stewart. Rush Limbaugh was moved to a live clearance (11a-2p) on KFYO in January 2001. Other West Texas talk stations, 710 KGNC and 1090 KKYN (now KVOP in Plainview) soon followed suit within a few years.
Back to KKCL, the station was sold to the Hicks family interests in the Fall of 1996 that eventually rolled up into Clear Channel Communications.  Clear Channel sold the station to Gap Broadcasting in 2007; what eventually became Gap Central Broadcasting (following the formation of GapWest Broadcasting) was folded into Townsquare Media on August 13, 2010.[tpl]cite news|title=Townsquare Media completes roll-up of GAP|url=http://www.rbr.com/radio/radio_deals/26710.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010|newspaper=Radio Business Report|date=August 13, 2010[/tpl]

[[Elon Howard Eaton]]
CATEGORIES: American naturalists, American ornithologists, Hobart and William Smith Colleges faculty, Columbia University alumni, People from Erie County, New York, People from Geneva, New York, 1866 births, 1934 deaths

Elon Howard Eaton (sometimes Elon Eton; 8 October 1866 – 27 March 1934) was an American ornithologist, scholar, and author.
He was born in the Town of Collins near Springville, New York, the son of Lucien Eaton and Sophie Newton.  As a youth, he took a taxidermy course in Buffalo, New York, where he prepared wildlife he had taken in the field with his shotgun. 
Eaton was home-schooled and self-taught in rural southern Erie County, although he also attended the Griffith Institute in nearby Springville.  He attended the University of Rochester where he graduated in 1890 with a B.A.  Subsequently, Eaton received an M.A (1893), M.Sc. (1911) and Sc.D. (1927), all from Rochester.  After teaching science in local schools, he attended Columbia University (1899–1900) for additional graduate work, studying paleontology under Henry Fairfield Osborn.
Eaton established the biology department in Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 1908, where he taught until his death.  He was the New York State ornithologist from 1908 to 1911. Each May he led a group of students and fellow ornithologists on a bird survey of Potter Swamp.
Part of the delay between volume one and volume two of "Birds of New York" was due to his marriage in 1909 to Gertrude Yeames and a heart attack in 1913.  The publication of this work elicited many letters to Eaton, including one from the then-young Roger Tory Peterson. In 1915, Eaton later married second time, to Ester Woodman. His two marriages produced four children.
Elon Eaton also enjoyed a sporting life. Game taken in the field Eaton prepared himself for dinner parties.
Eaton died in Geneva, New York of atherosclerosis.

The word pederasty derives from Greek [tpl]lang|grc||παιδεραστία[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc-Latn|paiderastia[/tpl]) "love of boys",http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/pederasty a compound derived from [tpl]lang|grc|παῖς[/tpl] (pais) "child, boy" and [tpl]lang|grc|ἐραστής[/tpl] (erastēs) "lover".
Historically, pederasty has existed as a variety of customs and practices within different cultures. The status of pederasty has changed over the course of history, at times considered an ideal and at other times a crime. In the history of Europe, its most structured cultural manifestation was Athenian pederasty, and became most prominent in the 6th century BC. Greek pederasty's various forms were the subject of philosophic debates in which the purely carnal type was unfavorably compared with erotic friendships and moderate forms. Symposium by Plato
The legal status of pederasty in most countries is currently determined by whether or not the boy has reached the local age of consent. Illegal forms of pederasty fall under child sexual abuse.

Modesto High School is a public high school in Modesto, California, U.S.A. It offers the International Baccalaureate Program and the Avid program, and was the first public school to do so in the Central Valley of California.
Modesto High School is the oldest high school in Modesto and as of 2013 will be turning 130 years of Panther Pride.http://mhs.monet.k12.ca.us/content/Information/mhshistory.html 
In 1883, Ruliff Stephen Holway saw the need for a high school that could provide for needs extending beyond a primary grammar education.  According to Sol P. Elias, member of the first graduating class of Modesto High School students, R.S. Holway was "a young schoolmaster... with the advantage of a charming character and a sympathetic mind... zeal and personality... (who) guided the pupils almost through the entire course until his departure... to accept a professorship at the University of California." This man, MHS' first principal, was responsible for the education of the entire student body, playing a role of both teacher and administrator before he left to teach in the UC system.  Forty pupils comprised the first class organized at the first building located at 14th and I Streets; after four years, ten of these students remained to take part in the first graduation of MHS students. In the succeeding years, the number of seniors receiving diplomas fluctuated greatly; the lowest number occurred in 1893 when no one remained in school all four years to graduate.
The high school moved to its current location in the 1940s.

In Neo-Freudian psychology, the Electra complex, as proposed by Carl Gustav Jung, is a girl’s psychosexual competition with her mother for possession of her father. In the course of her psychosexual development, the complex is the girl's phallic stage; formation of a discrete sexual identity, a boy's analogous experience is the Oedipus complex. The Electra complex occurs in the third — phallic stage (ages 3–6) — of five psychosexual development stages: (i) the Oral, (ii) the Anal, (iii) the Phallic, (iv) the Latent, and (v) the Genital — in which the source libido pleasure is in a different erogenous zone of the infant’s body.
In classical psychoanalytic theory, the child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Electra complex and of the Oedipus complex; his and her key psychological experience to developing a mature sexual role and identity. Sigmund Freud instead proposed that girls and boys resolved their complexes differently — she via penis envy, he via castration anxiety; and that unsuccessful resolutions might lead to neurosis and homosexuality[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=April 2014[/tpl]. Hence, women and men who are fixated in the Electra and Oedipal stages of their psychosexual development might be considered "father-fixated" and "mother-fixated" as revealed when the mate (sexual partner) resembles the father or the mother.

[[Oedipus complex]]

CATEGORIES: Complex (psychology), Freudian psychology, Greek mythology understanding and criticism, Incest, Psychoanalytic terminology

In  the term Oedipus complex (or, less commonly, Oedipal complex) denotes the emotions and ideas that the mind keeps in the unconscious, via dynamic repression, that concentrates upon a child's desire to sexually possess the parent of the opposite sex (e.g. males attracted to their mothers, whereas females are attracted to their fathers).Charles Rycroft A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (London, 2nd Ed. 1995)Joseph Childers, Gary Hentzi eds. Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism  (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995) Sigmund Freud, who coined the term "Oedipus complex" believed that the Oedipus complex is a desire for the parent in both males and females; Freud deprecated the term "Electra complex", which was introduced by Carl Gustav Jung in regard to the Oedipus complex manifested in young girls. The Oedipus complex occurs in the third — phallic stage (ages 3–6) — of the five psychosexual development stages: (i) the oral, (ii) the anal, (iii) the phallic, (iv) the latent, and (v) the genital — in which the source of libidinal pleasure is in a different erogenous zone of the infant's body.
In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex and of the Electra complex; key psychological experiences that are necessary for the development of a mature sexual role and identity. Sigmund Freud further proposed that boys and girls experience the complexes differently: boys in a form of castration anxiety, girls in a form of penis envy; and that unsuccessful resolution of the complexes might lead to neurosis, paedophilia, and homosexuality. Men and women who are fixated in the Oedipal and Electra stages of their psychosexual development might be considered "mother-fixated" and "father-fixated". In adult life this can lead to a choice of a sexual partner who   resembles one's parent.

Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for womenSigmund Freud, New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (PFL 2) p. 158-163 — the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that women do not have a penis being castration anxiety. Freud's theories regarding psychosexual development, and in particular the phallic stage, were rejected, criticized or challenged by other psychoanalysts, such as Karen Horney, Otto Fenichel and Ernest Jones, Erik Erikson, Jean Piaget, Juliet Mitchell and philosophers or sociologists such as Clara Thompson, Betty Friedan, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Hélène Cixous.Peter Gay, Freud (1989) p. 520-2Jane Gallup, Feminism and Psychoanalysis (1982) p. 69 and p. 84R.

CATEGORIES: DOS technology, DOS memory management

In computing, the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) is a specification published in 1989 by Phar Lap Software that allows a DOS program to run in protected mode, granting access to many features of the processor not available in real mode.  It was supplanted by DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) shortly after being introduced, due in large part to VCPI's inability to work in Windows 3.0's protected mode.

William Sean Bennett (born November 9, 1975) is a former professional American and Canadian football running back. He was drafted by the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) in the fourth round of the 1999 NFL Draft. He played college football for the Evansville Purple Aces, Illinois Fighting Illini and Northwestern Wildcats.
Bennett began his collegiate career as a baseball and football player at the University of Illinois, but transferred to the University of Evansville after one year. At Evansville he was an All-American two–times but had to transfer due to the school dropping football as a sport. Bennett then attended Northwestern University where he was a fullback and was mainly a blocker but did get a few rushing attempts.
Since he was a senior after his single season at Northwestern, he elected to enter the 1999 NFL Draft and surprised many by being selected by the New York Giants in the fourth round. He played four seasons in New York but ended up injured each season and was released after 2002. He then joined the New York Jets but was released before the season began. After his failed stints in New York he played for the Canadian Football League's Ottawa Renegades and Toronto Argonauts; and the Evansville BlueCats of the Indoor Football League.

CATEGORIES: War correspondents of World War I

Military attachés and war correspondents in the First World War were historians creating first-hand accounts of a multi-national, multi-continent, multi-ocean military conflict. In this multi-year series of military engagements across a worldwide landscape of theaters of battle, the military taxonomy of war became increasingly complex.
The First World War was the first modern mediated war in the sense that warfare becomes conflicts and controversies between parties who exchange information and arguments indirectly by the mass media. The discourse in mediated conflicts is influenced by its public character. By forwarding information and arguments to the media, conflict parties attempt to gain support from their constituencies and persuade their opponents.Kepplinger, Hans Mathias et al.

[[Geotraces]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical oceanography

GEOTRACES an international research programme that aims to improve our understanding of biogeochemical cycles in the oceans.
The concept of cycle describes the pathway by which a chemical element moves through the three major compartments of Earth (such as continents, atmosphere, and ocean). Because these cycles are directly related to climate dynamics and are heavily impacted by global change, it is essential to quantify them.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/463145a[/tpl]Chemical & Engineering News Vol. 86 No. 35, 1 Sept. 2008, "Geotraces gets going", p. 57All GEOTRACES Peer-reviewed Papers are available on the GEOTRACES Database
GEOTRACES focuses on the oceanic part of the cycles, with the ambition to map the distribution of trace elements and isotopes in the ocean and to understand the processes controlling this distribution. Some of these trace elements are directly linked to climate via, for example, their role as essential nutrients for life; others allow quantification of ocean processes (origin and dynamics of matter, age of water masses, etc.); some of them are pollutants (for example, lead or mercury). Modelling based on the data collected will thus achieve substantial progress in understanding the current and past of the ocean and improve projections of the ocean’s response to global change.
GEOTRACES is organised internationally under the auspices of the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (of the International Council for Science). Its management is overseen by a Scientific Steering Committee (SSC), with representatives of 15 nations from across the globe, and the programme involves active participation of more than 30 nations. 
The GEOTRACES SSC was initially led by co-chairs, Prof. Robert F. Anderson of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (Columbia University) and Prof. Gideon M. Henderson of Oxford University. Current co-chairs are Prof. Ed Boyle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Reiner Schlitzer of the Alfred Wegener Institute.

John Rais (born c. 1973) is a designer, blacksmith and sculptor known for his architectural work, vessels, and furniture.  Rais primarily works in steel as well as titanium, bronze, copper, stainless steel, and other materials.  He is well known for his one-of-a-kind firescreens.  Rais was born and raised in  Burlington, Massachusetts, the youngest of seven children.  Rais was introduced to blacksmithing in a sculpture class at the age of 18.  He went to college at the Massachusetts College of Art, graduating in 1995, BFA Sculpture. After working at an architectural ironworks and a living history museum in Massachusetts, he decided to go to graduate school.  Rais received his masters of fine arts degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1998, after which he worked at Peters Valley Craft Center as a department head. Rais was a department head of blacksmithing at Peter's Valley from 1998 to 2001. He has run his own design and metalsmithing studio since 1998. He now lives in Shelburne, Massachusetts.
While at Cranbrook, Rais was approached by two collectors to make three fire screens for their large Arts and Crafts style home in Bloomfield, Michigan. This commission was the springboard to him opening a business.  Rais opened his studio  after graduate school in 1998. He did so with about $850.00 and a fire screen commission. In the early years of the studio, several collectors and gallery shows sustained the studio, including the designer, ceramic artist, mentor and friend, Bennett Bean. In 2001, Rais began to try doing craft shows as a way to reach a wider audience and gain the attention of galleries. His first national show was the Philadelphia Museum of Art Craft Show. He went on to repeatedly exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum Show, Smithsonian Craft Show, Washington Craft Show, and Craft Boston. 
He gained many gallery relationships through these shows. He had shown with and or represented by Thirteen Moons Gallery (now Jane Sauer), Del Mano Gallery, Gallery 500, Mobilia Gallery, and Snyderman-Works Gallery including several others. 
His commissioned architectural work has always been one of a kind. It is collected nationally and is often featured in books and magazines. In 2009 he began working on a Museum acquisition for Yale University Art Galleries. The project is a series of 90 decorative panels that span the railing of the main staircase. The project takes many design cues from the building's Gothic Revival style and is influenced in part by some of the architectural ironwork in the museum by Samuel Yellin. The work is now part of the museum's permanent collection. Rais was one of only three artists commissioned by Yale Art Galleries as part of the museum's massive renovation/expansion completed in 2012. Rais's piece is open for viewing in late 2012.

[[Satan from the 7th grade]]

CATEGORIES: 1937 books, Children's novels, Young adult novels, Polish novels

Satan from the 7th grade ([tpl]lang-pl|Szatan z siódmej klasy[/tpl]) is an 1937 children's book (or rather, a young adult book - a term which did not exist at the time of writing) by Polish writer Kornel Makuszyński. 
It is considered a classic in Poland, where it has remained in print for decades, whatever changes and upheavals the country passed through. 
It is also popular in other countries such as Israel, where two Hebrew translations were published - the translators making a considerable effort to translate the colloquial Polish of the original into up-to-date Israeli equivalents. 
Note: The "Seventh Grade" of the title is according to the Polish educational system at the time of writing, where youngsters underwent four years of Elementary education followed by eight years of Further or High School. The book's protagonist is in the 7th grade of the latter, (11th grade in North American English-language usage) and is thus about 17 years old.

Examples from elsewhere in the state include a PDA that oversees the Meydenbauer Center, a performing arts venue in Bellevue, Washington and the Hurricane Ridge Public Development Authority, created by the city of Port Angeles, Washington to develop and oversee the Hurricane Ridge Ski and Snowboard Area.
A PDA is legally separate from the city or county that establishes it. Under state and federal law, all PDA contracts must specify that liabilities incurred by the corporation must be satisfied exclusively from their own assets. According to the City of Seattle, "This allows accomplishment of public purpose activities without assuming them into the regular functions of City government." Each Seattle PDA is governed by a volunteer council that oversees PDA activities and staff.

Laurentia (North American Craton) is a large continental craton, which forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent. Many times in its past, Laurentia has been a separate continent as it is now in the form of North America, although originally it also included the cratonic areas of Greenland and also the northwestern part of Scotland, known as the Hebridean Terrane. During other times in its past, Laurentia has been part of larger continents and supercontinents and itself consists of many smaller terranes assembled on a network of Early Proterozoic orogenic belts.  Small microcontinents and oceanic islands collided with and sutured onto  the ever-growing Laurentia, and together formed the stable Precambrian craton we see today.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Dalziel |first=I.W.D. |year=1992 |title=On the organization of American Plates in the Neoproterozoic and the breakout of Laurentia |journal=GSA Today |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=237–241[/tpl]

[[Zerezindo]]
CATEGORIES: 578 deaths, Gothic people, Year of birth uncertain

Zerezindo (533/34 – 30 July 578) was a Visigothic dux (duke), probably of Baetica, where he was buried.He may have been a Byzantine doux, but probably not, according Paul Goubert, "L'Espagne byzantine. Administration de l'Espagne byzantine, II. Influences byzantines religieuses et politiques sur l'Espagne wisigothique" Revue des études byzantines 4 (1946), 72. Retrieved 16 May 2013. His funerary inscription was found in the house once belonging to Juan Álvarez de Bohorques in Villamartín in Écija. It reads:Ernst Willibald Emil Hübner (1871), Inscriptiones Hispaniae christianae edidit Aemilius Hübner: adiecta est tabula geographica (G. Reimerum), 26. 
 
 A † ω 
ZEREZINDO · DVX · FD 
VIXIT ANNOS PLVS MINVS 
XLIIII · OBIT · III · KAL · AG 
ERA · D · C · XVI

The first line of the inscription, a symbol of Jesus Christ, shows the Greek letters alpha and omega on either side of a cross. The rest of the inscription reads "Zerezindo, duke, FD, lived forty-four years and died on the 3 kalends of August of the Era 616." The interpretation of "FD" has eluded scholars. Rodrigo Caro and Fray Christoval de San Antonio read it as filius ducis, "son of the duke", implying that Zerezindo's father was also a duke. Juan Francisco Masdeu reads it as Famulus Dei, "servant of God", and cites the inscription of a certain Exuperantius from the same year near Frexenal.Juan Francisco Masdeu (1791), Historia critica de España, y de la Cultura Española (A. de Sancha), 361–2. It has also been intrepreted as an abbreviation for fidelis, "faithful one, loyal one the king". 
The most intereting fact about Zerezindo is his Germanic name and the implication of his headstone that he was a Catholic at a time when most Visigoths were Arian Christians.E. A. Thompson (1960), "The Conversion of the Visigoths to Catholicism," Nottingham Mediaeval Studies, 4, 8 n19. This is especially noteworthy considering his high rank; a Catholic Goth had managed to ascend to the uppermost military rank in an Arian noble society.E. A. Thompson (1969), The Goths in Spain (Oxford: Clarendon Press), 37n. 
Etymologically, Zerezindo's interesting name attests to his probable Gothic identity.Though it is possible he was a Hispano-Roman—they were mostly Catholics—with a Germanic name. His name has been normalised as Seresind (Seresindus).Adalbert Kuhn (1872), Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete der indogermanischen Sprachen (Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht), 435. The Germanic root of its first component may be swērs ("swear");Gerhard Köbler (1989), Gotisches Wörterbuch (BRILL), 707. or perhaps skari ("band").Moritz Goldschmidt (1887), Zur Kritik der altgermanischen Elemente im spanischen (Druck von J. L. v. d. Velde Veldmann), 60. The latter component comes from swinþs/ô ("strength").

Jaques le Vinier (fl. 1240–60)L. A.

He was a member of the Puy d'Arras and wrote a jeu parti with Andrieu Contredit. His floruit dates are reconstructed on the basis of his reference to Jehan Bretel in his chanson d'amour De loial amour. Besides chansons d'amour, Jaques also wrote chansons dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The main source preserving his work is the Vatican Chansonnier. Jaques wrote original melodies for his Marian songs, while most such works by other trouvères were contrafacta of pre-existing music. The plagal melodies, all in bar form, are simple, but include both isometric or heterometric tunes. Jaques's complete œuvre comprises:
It is doubtful whether this last one is Jaques's. Unlike his other Marian chansons, it is a contrafactum of Lo clar tems vei brunezir by Raimon Jordan.

Sunbury Lunatic Asylum first opened in October 1879. Its proclamation as an Asylum was published in the Government Gazette on 31 October 1879.
Prior to being opened as an Asylum Sunbury was controlled by the Department of Industrial and Reformatory Schools (VA 1466). When Sunbury was acquired by the Hospitals for the Insane Branch (VA 2863) patients were transferred from the Ballarat Asylum (VA 2844) and the Ballarat Asylum was handed over to the Department of Industrial and Reformatory Schools. Patients were also transferred from Yarra Bend Asylum (VA 2839).
Since its establishment the title of the institution at Sunbury has been altered several times to reflect both the community's changing attitude towards mental illness and the Victorian Government's approach to the treatment of mentally disturbed persons. Despite the changes in designation the function and structure of the agency has not altered significantly, therefore the institution has been registered as one continuous agency. From its establishment until 1905 the institution at Sunbury was known as an Asylum. This title emphasised its function as a place of detention rather than a hospital which provided treatment for mentally ill people who could be cured. The Lunacy Act 1903 (No.1873) of changed the title of all "asylums" to "hospitals for the insane". This Act came into operation in March 1905. The Mental Hygiene Act 1933 (No.4157) altered the title to "mental hospitals".
An asylum/hospital for the insane etc. was any public building proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council and published in the Government Gazette as a place for the reception of mentally ill persons. An asylum could also provide wards for the temporary reception of patients as well as long term patients. Up until the Mental Health Act 1959 became operative in 1962 these "short-term" wards were known as "receiving houses" or "receiving wards". The Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605) designated hospitals providing short-term diagnosis and accommodation as "psychiatric hospitals". However throughout its life Sunbury has been used almost exclusively for long-term patients.
Patients could not be retained in an Asylum without a warrant requesting their admission. Prior to 1867 the warrant was signed by the Governor. After this date the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) was responsible for this function. From 1934 the Director of Mental Hygiene (VA 2866) and from 1952 the Chief Medical Officer of the Mental Hygiene Branch (VA 2866) were successively responsible for admission of patients. The Lunacy Act 1914 (No.2539) made provision for the admission of patients on a voluntary basis, i.e. on a patient's own request for a specified period of time.
In 1962 under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605) Sunbury was proclaimed in the Government Gazette as a Mental Hospital and a Training Centre as it was responsible for mentally disturbed and mentally retarded patients. In 1985 responsibility for Sunbury was passed from the Mental Health Division (VA 6961) of the Department of Health II (VA 2695) to the Office of Intellectual Disability Services (VA 2909), a division of the Department of Community Services (VA 2633). It was used for a period thereafter as a training centre to accommodate intellectually handicapped persons.
Victoria University purchased the site in 1999 and operated it as a university campus for several years; it closed the campus in 2011.

The Keating Five were five United States Senators accused of corruption in 1989, igniting a major political scandal as part of the larger Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., Chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which was the target of a regulatory investigation by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). The FHLBB subsequently backed off taking action against Lincoln.
Lincoln Savings and Loan collapsed in 1989, at a cost of over $3 billion to the federal government. Some 23,000 Lincoln bondholders were defrauded and many investors lost their life savings. The substantial political contributions Keating had made to each of the senators, totaling $1.3 million, attracted considerable public and media attention. After a lengthy investigation, the Senate Ethics Committee determined in 1991 that Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle had substantially and improperly interfered with the FHLBB's investigation of Lincoln Savings, with Cranston receiving a formal reprimand. Senators Glenn and McCain were cleared of having acted improperly but were criticized for having exercised "poor judgment".
All five senators served out their terms. Only Glenn and McCain ran for re-election, and they both retained their seats. McCain would go on to run for President of the United States twice, including being the Republican Party nominee in 2008.

The type species for this section is  Schauer's Verticordia drumondii''. 
The species described as within this section usually have a single stem, but some have a lignotuber that will produce several stems after regrowth. The flowers are scented, slightly to very sweet smelling, a hypanthium with down-ward curving appendages, bracteoles which are shed, and sepals with fringed lobes. The flowers have petals with a fringed or toothed margin and a curved style that is hairy at the apex. The leaf margins are similar to the petals, and partly cylindrical or concave in profile.
George's arrangement came to include the following species:George, A.S. (1991) New taxa, combinations and typifications in Verticordia (Myrtaceae: Chamelaucieae). Nuytsia 7(3): 281

He was born in Rhode Island, the son of John Aplin, and became a lawyer like his father, setting up practice in Newport. As a loyalist, he was forced to move to New York City and went to Nova Scotia in 1783. In 1787, he went to St. John's Island (later Prince Edward Island) as solicitor general for Edmund Fanning. In 1790, he was named attorney general. Aplin was charged with wrongdoing by supporters of former governor Walter Patterson in 1791; he was exonerated and successfully sued for damages in 1793. In 1798, after becoming associated with a group advocating that the island rejoin Nova Scotia, he resigned from the island's Council and was dismissed as attorney general. After unsuccessfully attempting to clear his name in England, he returned to Annapolis Royal where he resumed his law practice. Aplin is believed to have died in Rhode Island.

Tamahara Dam (玉原ダム) is a rock-fill embankment dam on a Tone River tributary in Gunma Prefecture of Japan. It is located [tpl]Convert|14|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Numata. It creates the upper reservoir for the 1,200 MW Tamahara Pumped Storage Power Station (玉原発電所). Construction began in 1973 and the dam was complete in 1981 while the power station was commissioned in 1986. It is [tpl]Convert|116|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall and withholds a reservoir with a storage capacity of [tpl]Convert|14800000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Of that capacity, [tpl]Convert|13000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] is active (or useful) for power generation. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage power station is created by the Fujiwara Dam, located [tpl]Convert|4|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to the northwest on another Tone River tributary. Power is generated during periods of high energy demand and pumping occurs during times when energy demand is low such as at night. The power station contains four 300 MW reversible Francis turbine pump-generators which serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The upper Tamahara Reservoir is at an elevation of [tpl]Convert|1177|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and the lower Fujiwara Reservoir is at [tpl]Convert|651|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] which affords the power station an effective hydraulic head of [tpl]Convert|518|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].

An issue number is a supplementary number to the account number of certain debit cards, primarily United Kingdom ones such as Switch and Maestro. Because the bulk of the account number is determined by the bank account number, the card number cannot be changed if the card is lost or stolen (without changing the underlying bank account number), and instead the issue number is changed.

The Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis (BAH) is the physiological hypothesis that acclimating to a particular environment (usually thermal) provides an organism with advantages in that environment. First formally defined and tested by Armand Marie Leroi, Albert Bennett, and Richard Lenski in 1994, it has however been a central assumption in historical physiological work that acclimation is adaptive.  Further refined by Raymond B. Huey and David Berrigan under the strong inference approach, the hypothesis has been falsified as a general rule by a series of multiple hypotheses experiments.

Sense and Nonsense is an American game show hosted by Bob Kennedy which ran on New York City TV station WABD from 1951-1954. The show consisted of two three-child teams using their five senses to complete challenges and earn money, with the high-scoring team returning on the next show.
Sponsored by Coca-Cola (specifically "Coke in-a-bottle"), and with a somewhat-unorthodox Monday-Wednesday-Friday airing schedule, Sense has since gained something of a "cult following" among fans of early television. While only shown on WABD, it is often considered a DuMont Television Network program due to not only being on the network's flagship affiliate, but having several production "quirks" typical of many DuMont programs.

She was considered close to Morarji Desai and was on his side in the battle of succession between Desai and Indira Gandhi to replace Lal Bahadur Shastri as Prime Minister. When Desai and other elders resigned from Congress to form a splinter group, she too joined it. In the Indira wave during 1971 Lok Sabha elections, she lost from Barh as Congress(O) candidate to the Congress nominee Dharamvir Sinha, her first taste of electoral defeat. She lost the assembly election next year as well, and returned to Indira Gandhi's party. In 1977, she fought Lok Sabha election from Begusarai  as Congress candidate and lost in the Janata wave as Congress was completely routed in Bihar. After this defeat, she fought a by-election to Lok Sabha in November 1978 from Samastipur as Congress candidate but lost again.

[[Chatham Islands skink]]

CATEGORIES: Oligosoma, Reptiles of New Zealand

The Chatham Island skink, Oligosoma nigriplantare, is a species of skink in the family Scincidae.
It is the sole reptile species found on the Chatham Islands of New Zealand where it occurs on all the major islands except Chatham Island itself.  Given the geological history of the Chatham Islands, it is assumed that O. n. nigriplantare previously occurred on Chatham Island; however, there are no fossil records or historical reports of O. n. nigriplantare on Chatham Island.Hitchmough RA, Bull L, Cromarty P (2005) New Zealand Threat Classification Lists.

Indeed, O. n. nigriplantare (up to 91 mm Snout to Vent Length; SVL) has a substantially larger body size than O. n. polychroma (up to 77 mm SVL).Patterson GB, Daugherty CH (1990) Four new species and one new subspecies of skinks, genus Leiolopisma (Reptilia: Lacertilia: Scincidae) from New Zealand. Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand, 20, 65–84;Gill B, Whitaker T (2001) New Zealand Frogs and Reptiles. David Bateman, Auckland, New Zealand
Recent genetic studies indicate that O. n. nigriplantare diverged from Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma (its nearest relative) 5.86–7.29 million years ago.Liggins, Chapple, Daughertry and Ritchie - Origin and post-colonization evolution of the Chatham Islands skink (Oligosoma nigriplantare nigriplantare)" Molecular ecology 0962-1083 Liggins yr:2008 vol:17 iss:14 pg:3290 -3305" This pre-dates the emergence date for the Chatham Islands, but indicates that O. n. nigriplantare colonized the Chatham Islands via overwater dispersal on a single occasion. There is substantial morphological variability evident in O. n. nigriplantare, and a shallow level of genetic differential between islands within the Chatham Islands indicating low gene flow between islands, but not speciation between islands.  The level of genetic and morphological divergence between O. n. nigriplantare and Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma might warrant their recognition as distinct species.

The 1998–99 Liga Alef season was held between 11 September 1998 and 29 May 1999. It was the last season (until 2009–10) in which Liga Alef was the third tier of Israeli football, as the creation of the Israeli Premier League in the summer of 1999 meant that it became the fourth tier.
Due to the restructuring, two clubs were due to be promoted from each division; Hapoel Ra'anana and Hapoel Nazareth Illit from the north and Hapoel Dimona and Hapoel Ramat Gan from the south.
During the summer of 1999, Maccabi Jaffa were demoted to Liga Alef (from Liga Leumit) after their budget was not approved by the Israel Football Association, which resulted in Maccabi Sha'arayim (the third-placed club with the highest points total) being promoted alongside the top two from the South Division. In addition, Hapoel Ashdod, Hapoel Lod and SK Nes Tziona were all demoted from Liga Artzit after their budgets were not approved by the IFA. This resulted in the third- and fourth-placed clubs from the North Division (Hapoel Iksal and Hapoel Acre) and the fourth-placed club in the South Division (Shimshon Tel Aviv) also being promoted.

Baikunth Shukla (1907–1934) was an Indian nationalist and revolutionary. He was the nephew of Yogendra Shukla, one of the founders of Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).
He was hanged for murdering Phanindra Nath Ghosh who had become a government approver which led to hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. Baikunth Shukla was also initiated into the freedom struggle at a young age taking active part in the Salt Satyagraha of 1930. He was associated with revolutionary organisations like the Hindustan Seva Dal and HSRA. The execution of Indian revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev in 1931 as a result of their trial in the Lahore conspiracy case was an event that shook the entire country. 
Phanindra Nath Ghosh, hitherto a key member of the Revolutionary Party had treacherously betrayed the cause by turning an approver, giving evidence, which led to the execution. Baikunth was commissioned to plan the execution of Ghosh as an act of ideological vendetta which he carried out successfully on 9 November 1932. He was arrested and tried for the killing. Baikunth was convicted and hanged in Gaya Central Jail on May 14, 1934. He was only 28 years old.

CATEGORIES: Watermills in Leicestershire

King's Mill is the traditional crossing point of the River Trent between Castle Donington in Leicestershire and Weston-on-Trent in Derbyshire. The Mill was the farthest point that traffic from the River Humber could progress.

[[Nakheel Harbour and Tower]]
CATEGORIES: Proposed buildings and structures in Dubai, Nakheel Properties

Nakheel Harbour and Tower was a multibillion dollar real estate project planned in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It was being built by the developer Nakheel, who once declared that the finished development will be the new, unofficial capital of Dubai. When completed, the project was expected to contain the world's tallest structure, the Nakheel Tower, and the world's largest inner city marina. The site was to cover approximately 270 hectares. The development and masterplan of the project are based on Islamic principles of design. The project was cancelled due to the Late-2000s financial crisis.
Plans for the tower indicated that it would have been more than 1 kilometer high, with one report stating a height of 1,400 meters (4,593 ft). However, Nakheel never disclosed the structure's final height. According to Nakheel, it was to have more than 200 floors and about 150 elevators. In height, it would have far surpassed the Burj Khalifa.
Another 40 smaller towers were to stand in the area surrounding the main tower. The development would have also include promenades, part of the Arabian Canal, pedestrian bridges, and several forms of easily-accessible public transportation. Over 50,000 people were expected to live in the development if it were completed.
However, in January 2009, because of the Late-2000s financial crisis, the tower was put on hold, and was cancelled 18 months later.http://www.arabianbusiness.com/558194-1km-nakheel-tower-plan-further-delayed---report
A station on the Dubai Metro's Red Line is named after Nakheel Harbor and Tower.

He was the first British-born black man to serve on the Board of a major UK public company (Reuters) and is currently a Director of Thomson Reuters (where he is a member of the Audit Committee). He was also a Director (and Chair of the Remuneration Committee) of Canada's largest independent software developer, Open Text Corporation. More recently, he served as a Non Executive Director of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) from 2007. He also serves on the Board of, or is an adviser to, several privately held and innovative companies including the UK's leading corporate governance advisor, Independent Audit.
He is a Freeman of the City of London; Past Master of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists; a Director of the Thomson Reuters Foundation; Chairman of Thames Reach (a charity working to shelter and resettle the homeless in London); founding Chairman of the Powerlist Foundation; a Vice President of the British Computer Society and a past member of the Government's Women's Enterprise Taskforce. He was also a Governor of the Peabody Trust for a decade and a NED of the West Lambeth NHS Trust for three and a half years. His experience of regulation is substantial. He has been a regulatee of the FSA since 1993 and a start-up regulator twice; first as an inaugural Postal Services Commissioner from 2001 to 2004 and more recently as a Board member of IPSA, the body charged with managing MPs' expenses, pay and pensions.

The General Dynamics MIM-46 Mauler was a self-propelled anti-aircraft missile system designed to a late 1950s US Army requirement for a system to combat low-flying high-performance tactical fighters and short-range ballistic missiles. Based on the M113 chassis, Mauler carried search and attack radars, fire control computers and nine missiles in a highly mobile platform. An ambitious design for its era, the Mauler ran into intractable problems during development, and was eventually canceled in November 1965.
Mauler's cancellation left the US Army with no modern anti-aircraft weapon, and they rushed development of the much simpler MIM-72 Chaparral and M163 VADS to fill this niche. These weapons were much less capable than Mauler, and were intended solely as a stop-gap solution until more capable vehicles were developed. In spite of this, no real replacement entered service until the late 1990s. Both the US Navy and British Army were also expecting Mauler to fulfil their own short-range needs and its cancellation left them with the same problem. They used RIM-7 Sea Sparrow and Rapier missile, respectively, to fill these needs.

The Monorierdő train collision occurred on October 6, 2008, near Monorierdő, Hungary. A regular passenger train coming from Nyíregyháza collided with the Hajdú InterCity train, on its way from Debrecen to Budapest. At 10:20 am, the regular train's control car crashed into the last car of the Intercity train; its engine driver survived, because he ran back into the first car to warn the passengers when he realized the accident could not be avoided. The tragedy was caused by an error in the train control system.
Four travelers died as a result of the accident (three people on the site, and one of them in the hospital). 27 people were in need of additional hospital treatment. Pál Szabó, the traffic minister of Hungary offered his resignation shortly after the tragedy, and Miklós Kamarás, the president of MÁV (Hungarian State Railways Co.) did the same. Prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány accepted both, however, he didn't accept the resignation of István Heinczinger, CEO of MÁV.

The Pashtuns have never been subdued or conquered per se but only restrained. Baburs’ predecessors like Alexander the great, Mahmud Ghazni, Muhammad Ghori, Genghis Khan and Timur Lane all either managed to only restrain the Pashtuns for a while or did not bother them at all in order to avoid a bloody and needless confrontation. But Babur had no choice as he had to confront the people in his immediate territory.He too had to make alliances and give autonomy to the Pathans in order to maintain peace.

CATEGORIES: Telephone crimes, Teletraffic

Nuisance calls encompass any type of unwanted, unsolicited, telephone call. Common types of nuisance calls include prank calls, telemarketing calls, and silent calls. Obscene phone calls and other threatening calls are criminal acts in most jurisdictions, particularly when hate crime is involved.
Unsolicited calls may also be used to initiate telephone frauds. Fax machines may also receive junk faxes via unsolicited calls.
Caller ID provides some protection against unwanted calls, but can still be turned off by the calling party. Even where end-user Caller ID is not available, calls are still logged, both in billing records at the originating telco and via automatic number identification, so the perpetrator's phone number can still be discovered in many cases. However, these do not provide complete protection: harassers can use payphones, in some cases, caller ID (but not necessarily automatic number identification itself) can be spoofed or blocked. Mobile telephone abusers can (at some cost) use "throwaway" mobile phones or SIMs. Voice over IP users may send bogus caller ID or route calls through servers in multiple countries.
Even in these cases, with sufficient law enforcement and telco effort, persistent abusers can often be tracked down by technical means. However recently wiretapping by law enforcement in many jurisdictions; especially in the United States has helped circumvent such disguise-like methods by the harasser. 
Call screening is another countermeasure against unsolicited calls.
Most telephone companies have a department devoted to handling complaints regarding unsolicited phone calls; in criminal cases such as obscene or threatening phone calls, many police departments have dedicated resources devoted to dealing with such cases.

Interstate Highways in the U.S. state of Connecticut run a total of [tpl]convert|446.33|mi|km[/tpl]. Connecticut has three primary highways and five auxiliary highways. Most of the highways are maintained by the Connecticut Department of Transportation, with the exception of Interstate 684, which is maintained by the New York State DOT.[tpl]cite web|title=Connecticut State Numbered Routes and Roads Highway Log|url=http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/hwylog/hwylog.pdf|publisher=ConnDOT|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=31 December 2010[/tpl]
In 1957, Connecticut received approval for the routes of its three primary Interstate highways: I-84, I-91, and I-95. This plan was extended in 1959 to include I-291 and I-491. The first Interstate Highway signs were installed on a completed section of I-91 north of Hartford in 1961. The primary interstates were all completed by 1969 after the last section of I-84 opened between Farmington and Plainville. The rest of the highways were built or renumbered to their current designations by 1994 when a five mile section of I-291 opened 35 years behind schedule. Connecticut was one of the last states in the US to raise its maximum speed limit to [tpl]convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], which it did in 1998.[tpl]cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ct-chrono.html|work=Kurumi|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=17 January 2013[/tpl]

Adams[tpl]cite book |title=The People's City: The glory and grief of an Alabama town, 1850-1874 |last=Smith |first=Winston |year=2003 |publisher=Marengo County Historical Society |location=Demopolis, Alabama |isbn= |pages=22 [/tpl] and began as a log dogtrot house.  It was then expanded until it came to superficially resemble a Tidewater-type cottage.  Brought to the early Alabama frontier by settlers from the Tidewater and Piedmont regions of Virginia, this vernacular house-type is usually a story-and-a-half in height, displays strict symmetry, and is characterized by prominent end chimneys flanking a steeply pitched longitudinal gable roof that is often pierced by dormer windows.[tpl]cite book |title=Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930 |last=Gamble |first=Robert |year=1990 |publisher=The University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |isbn=0-8173-1134-3 |pages=33–35 [/tpl] 
The house was moved to Cedar Crest Farms in 1988 and restored by members of the Rankin family. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on February 19, 1988 and to the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1993 as a part of the Plantation Houses of the Alabama Canebrake and Their Associated Outbuildings Multiple Property Submission.

The Monti della Tolfa or "Tolfa Mountains" are a volcanic group in the Anti-Apennines of the northern part of the Lazio region of central Italy. They are bounded by the Tyrrhenian Sea coast to the west, by the Monti Sabatini to the east, and by the Monti Cimini and the Mignone river to the north. Tolfa and Allumiere are the principal towns.
The highest peak is the Monte della Grazie, at 616 m above sea level. The Monti della Tolfa consist mostly of trachytes formed during the Eocene and the early Pleistocene. 
The mountains are an important source of alunite, from which alum is extracted. The mineral was discovered there in 1461, and extensively mined until the mine closed in 1941, after almost 500 years; for much of this time it was the principal source of alum in Europe. 
The Tolfetano breed of horse originates in the area, and takes its name from it.

[[Trade finance]]
CATEGORIES: Business terms, International trade, International finance

Trade Finance is basically related to Domestic as well as International Trade Transaction.
The term "Trade Finance" means, finance for Trade. For a trade transaction there should be a Seller to sell the goods or services and a Buyer who will buy the goods or use the services. Various intermediaries such as (banks), (Financial Institutions) can facilitate this trade transaction by financing the trade.
While a seller (the exporter) can require the purchaser (an importer) to prepay for goods shipped, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped. Banks may assist by providing various forms of support. For example, the importer's bank may provide a letter of credit to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a bill of lading. The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.
Other forms of trade finance can include Documentary Collection, Trade Credit Insurance, Factoring or Forfaiting. Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.
Since secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer, the advent of new methodologies in the information systems world, has allowed the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into new advanced finance models. This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the Importer's Balance Sheet. As the world progresses towards more flexibility and growth in Trade Transactions, the demand for these new methodologies has increased amongst Exporters, Importers and Banks.
The following are the most famous products/services offered by various Banks and Financial Institutions in Trade Finance Segment.
1. Letter of Credit: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institute on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institute as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institute will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
2. Bank Guarantee: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary. Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.'''
3. Collection and Discounting of Bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks. The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.

The Sparta Rock House is a stone building near Sparta, Tennessee, United States, that once served as a rest stop and tollhouse.  Built in the late 1830s, the Rock House catered to traffic along an important wagon road between Knoxville and Nashville, offering badly needed lodging and supplies to travellers who had just crossed (or were about to cross, depending on their direction) the rugged Cumberland Plateau.  The Rock House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 for its architecture and  its historical role as an important rest stop.
The Rock House was probably built by either Samuel Denton or brothers Barlow and Madison Fiske, and initially operated by the latter two.  Early guests at the Rock House included presidents Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, and Governor Sam Houston.Tennessee Historical Commission, Sparta Rock House.  Retrieved: 25 March 2010.  It was home to a tollhouse and supply store until at least the 1850s, and was used as a school at various times between 1880 and 1921.  Due primarily to the efforts of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the state purchased and began restoring the Rock House in the 1940s.  The Rock House is currently operated as a state historic site.

He ran a very successful store in Selma and also maintained a home there.Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama, page 16. Clanton, Alabama: Heritage Publishing Consultants, 2000. ISBN 1-891647-58-X
When the community of Woodville, near Cedar Haven, applied for a post office, the name Woodville was already in use by another Alabama community.  Weaver suggested the name Uniontown and his suggestion remains as the name of the town until this day.  Phillip J. Weaver was killed in Selma in 1865, purportedly by a Union soldier, several months after Wilson's Raid on Selma.  The next owner of the plantation was John Davidson Alexander, born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina in 1820.  He died in 1901.  Cedar Haven was inherited by his son, Houston Alexander, following his death.
The house featured a two-story Doric tetrasyle portico.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1993 as a part of the Plantation Houses of the Alabama Canebrake and Their Associated Outbuildings Multiple Property Submission.  Although still standing in 2000, it has since been demolished.

The Kansas City Missouri Temple is the 137th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  It is the first to be built in the Greater Kansas City area.  Previous attempts at building an LDS temple in the area failed in Independence in 1833 and Far West in 1838, after LDS founder Joseph Smith had selected and dedicated locations for their construction. A temple was completed in Independence in 1994 by the Community of Christ church, which is not affiliated with the LDS Church and does not serve the same theological functions.

[[Anglo-Norman horse]]

CATEGORIES: Horse breeds, Horse breeds originating in France, Extinct horse breeds

  
The Anglo-Norman horse was a warmblood horse breed developed in Lower Normandy in northern France. A major center of horse breeding, the area had numerous regional types that were bred to one another and then crossed with Thoroughbreds to form the Anglo-Norman. Various body types developed within the Anglo-Norman breed, two of which were split off to form the Norman Cob and French Trotter. The remaining types were eventually standardized, although there remained some criticism of the "hybrid" nature of the breed's conformation. However, it was successful as an international sport horse, especially in the sport of show jumping. The Anglo-Norman  also contributed to the development of several other breeds in Europe and Asia.
The Anglo-Norman was developed in the early 19th century, and along with Thoroughbred and local Norman blood, influences were seen from other breeds, including British and Russian trotting horses. By the mid-19th century, the Anglo-Norman was a popular breed throughout France, and in 1864 a breed association was founded. While often purchased by the French army and used as cavalry and artillery horses, there was controversy over whether the Anglo-Norman was the best choice for the military. The late 19th century saw significant improvements in breeding programs, although there remained a dispute between the goals of breeders and the needs of the military. Mechanization in the early 20th century significantly reduced demand for the breed, and fighting during World War II and the German occupation of France resulted in major damage to breeding centers and the deaths of many horses. While rebuilding their herds, breeders turned away from draft and carriage horses and began breeding sport horses for equestrian competition.
A stud book was created for the Anglo-Norman in 1950, and during that decade the breed became successful in international competition. In 1958, the Anglo-Norman was combined with other French types to create the Selle Français, the national French saddle horse. Despite active government support for Selle Français breeding programs, variations remained, and Anglo-Norman bloodlines continued to be distinguishable for decades after the merge. In the 1990s and 2000s, a movement began to reopen the Anglo-Norman stud book and recreate it as a separate breed from the Selle Français. The plan, which remains open, has been presented to the French Stud Book Commission and Ministry of Agriculture, and created controversy within the French breeding community.

In mathematics, a bilateral hypergeometric series is a series Σan  summed over all integers n, and such that the ratio 
of two terms is a rational function of n. The definition of the  generalized hypergeometric series is similar, except that the terms with negative n must vanish; the bilateral series will in general have infinite numbers of non-zero terms for both positive and negative n.
The bilateral hypergeometric series fails to converge for most rational functions, though it can be analytically continued to a function defined for most rational functions. There are several summation formulas giving its values for special values where it does converge.

CATEGORIES: Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee, Historic house museums in Tennessee, Museums in Washington County, Tennessee, Tennessee State Historic Sites, State of Franklin

Tipton-Haynes State Historic Site, known also as Tipton-Haynes House, is a Tennessee state-owned historic site located at 2620 South Roan Street near Johnson City, Tennessee.  It includes a house originally built in 1784 by Colonel John Tipton (1730–1813), and 10 other buildings, including a smokehouse, pigsty, loom house, still house, springhouse, log barn and corncrib.  There is also the home of George Haynes, a Haynes family slave.
Tipton led the opposition to the State of Franklin, an unsuccessful attempt by the Tennessee Valley residents to form a state in the mid-1780s.  In late February 1788, the so-called "Battle of Franklin" took place when a militia led by John Sevier, who had been elected governor of the proposed state, surrounded the Tipton farm and demanded the return of several slaves Tipton had confiscated. When Tipton refused, gunfire was exchanged, followed by a two-day standoff.  Sevier's forces were finally scattered by the Sullivan County militia.  The Franklin movement largely collapsed following this engagement.Kevin Barksdale, The Lost State of Franklin: America's First Secession (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2009), pp. 133-136.
Following Tipton's death in 1813, the farm passed to his son, John Tipton, Jr., who in turn sold it to a local land speculator, David Haynes, in 1837.  In 1840, Haynes gave the farm to his son, Landon Carter Haynes (1816–1875), as a wedding present.  This younger Haynes enlarged the house and added weatherboarding. A Confederate senator during the Civil War, Landon Carter Haynes faced death threats from East Tennessee Unionists, and was forced to flee the region in 1865.  He sold the farm to his brother-in-law, Jonesborough publisher Lawson Gifford.  In 1945, Gifford's grandson, David Simmerly, sold the farm to the Tennessee Historical Commission, though he continued living there until his death.James Bellamy, "The Political Career of Landon Carter Haynes," East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 28 (1956), p. 105.
It is one of 17 Tennessee Historical Commission state-owned historic sites, and is operated by the Tipton-Haynes Association.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

Syreeta is the debut solo album by Motown singer Syreeta Wright, released in 1972 on Motown's MoWest subsidiary. Produced by Wright's ex-husband Stevie Wonder, it was released following the former couple's separation and subsequent divorce. The album featured compositions by both Wonder and Wright, and also featured Wright's takes on other artists' songs including a Wonder-produced funk-oriented version of his earlier recording, "I Love Every Little Thing About You", which was initially recorded by Wonder for his Music of My Mind project, released earlier that year. Wonder and Wright used the talk box prominently on Wright's cover of The Beatles' "She's Leaving Home" while Wright provided a smoother vocal take of Smokey Robinson's "What Love Has Joined Together". Wright wrote the ballad "Happiness" and she and Stevie co-wrote "Baby Don't You Let Me Lose This" and their featured duet "To Know You Is to Love You" together. The album failed to generate success though Wright would go on to a productive solo career throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Wright and Wonder would continue working together for several decades.

"On The Warpath" was the first American popular music to incorporate a repeating tom-tom effect in the score.Pisani, Imagining Native America in Music, p. 253: "Raymond A. Browne used a repeating tom-tom open-fifth trope for 'On the War-Path: A Wild-West Two-Step' (also 1904). Though the tom-tom effect had occasionally appeared in nineteenth-century balletic danses sauvages, 'On the War-Path' is the first such instance I have found in an American  popular song."

[[Commandant Royal Observer Corps]]
CATEGORIES: Royal Air Force appointments, Royal Observer Corps, People of the Royal Observer Corps

The Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps (CROC) was the Royal Air Force commander of the Royal Observer Corps.  All the holders of the post were RAF officers in the rank of Air Commodore, initially retired reserve officers then Auxiliary officers and, since the end of World War II, serving officers. The ROC was a uniformed civilian branch initially under the control of the Air Defence of Great Britain organization, then Fighter Command and latterly Strike Command.  The Royal Observer Corps existed from 1925 until it was stood down in 1995. Most of the commandants, with only three exceptions, were qualified RAF pilots, two being air navigators and the other a General Duties (Ground) Supply Branch officer. If a Royal Observer Corps officer had ever held the appointment, he would have held the rank of Observer Commodore.
The origins of the ROC go back to Metropolitan Observation Service of World War I which was founded by Air Vice Marshal Edward Ashmore.Maj Gen Ashmore However, Ashmore never held the post of ROC Commandant. The first two commandants were recently retired RAF Air Commodores, the next two were Auxiliary Air Force officers and the remainder were serving RAF officers. The last three commandants held the appointment in addition to their primary appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at Headquarters No. 11/18 Group RAF, which was colocated with HQROC at RAF Bentley Priory.
The organisation had started as the volunteer civilian Observer Corps in 1925 and became the uniformed Royal Observer Corps in 1941 as part of the RAF in recognition of their invaluable services during the Battle of Britain. Despite several attempts by the Home Office in the 1950s, 1960s and the 1980s to take over the organisation and dispense with the RAF uniform the ROC remained part of RAF Fighter Command and later RAF Strike Command until they were stood down in 1995 as a result of the Communist Bloc breaking up and the Cold War nuclear threat on the UK being removed.

[[Is Google Making Us Stupid?]]
CATEGORIES: 2008 works, The Atlantic (magazine) articles, World Wide Web, Cognition, Google, Works by Nicholas G. Carr, Books about the Internet

[tpl]Good article[/tpl]

"Is Google Making Us Stupid? What the Internet is doing to our brains" (alternatively "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?") is a magazine article by technology writer Nicholas G. Carr highly critical of the Internet's effect on cognition. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of The Atlantic magazine as a six-page cover story.[tpl]cite news |title=Pages and "pages" |author=Nicholas Carr |date=2008-06-12 |publisher=Rough Type |url=http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/06/pages_and_pages.php |accessdate=2008-11-01[/tpl] Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web. Carr expanded his argument in The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, a book published by W. W. Norton in June 2010.
The essay was extensively discussed in the media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally of a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised.[tpl]cite news |title=The internet shrinks your brain? What rubbish |author=David Aaronovitch |date=2008-08-13 |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article4517674.ece |accessdate=2008-12-01[/tpl] Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.
While long-term psychological and neurological studies have yet to yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, a few studies have provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.

[[Lattice graph]]
CATEGORIES: Planar graphs, Graph families

A lattice graph, mesh graph, or grid graph, is a graph whose drawing, embedded in some Euclidean space Rn, forms a regular tiling. This implies that the group of bijective transformations that send the graph to itself is a lattice in the group-theoretical sense.
Typically, no clear distinction is made between such a graph in the more abstract sense of graph theory, and its drawing in space (often the plane or 3D space). This type of graph may more shortly be called just a lattice, mesh, or grid. Moreover, these terms are also commonly used for a finite section of the infinite graph, as in "an 8×8 square grid".
The term lattice graph has also been given in the literature to various other kinds of graphs with some regular structure, such as the Cartesian product of a number of complete graphs.[tpl]mathworld|urlname=LatticeGraph|title=Lattice graph[/tpl]

Mephistos Höllenrufe (Summons of Mephistopheles from Hell or Cries of Mephistopheles from Hell), Op. 101, is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in 1851. It was first performed at the Vienna Volksgarten as part of a festival preceding Strauss' departure for a tour of Germany.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naxosdirect.com/title/8.550339 |title=STRAUSS II, J.: Waltzes, Polkas, Marches and Overtures|accessdate=2008-10-06|publisher=NaxosDirect[/tpl] The title of the composition is a quotation from the Bible: "And the devil Mephistopheles ... was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever" (Revelations, 20:10). A reporter for the Wiener Allgemeine Theaterzeitung commented on Strauss' waltz that  it "received such a favourable reception, on account of its effective and original melodies and brilliant instrumentation, that it had to be repeated three times".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naxosdirect.ca/STRAUSS-II-J-100-Most-Famous-Works-Vol--4/title/8554520/ |title=STRAUSS II, J.: 100 Most Famous Works, Vol. 4 CD |accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=NaxosDirect[/tpl] Especially colourful, and keeping with the work's ominous title, is the second waltz theme: its cheerful, ascending tune is suddenly interrupted, and then answered by a sinister chromatic descending passage. Some of the waltz themes of the work (specifically, the waltzes 1C, 2A, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, and 5B) are found in close proximity to one another in the earliest of Strauss' "sketchbooks", and were probably written in the first half of 1851.

[[SBUV/2]]
CATEGORIES: Earth observation satellites

The Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer, or SBUV/2, is a series of operational remote sensors on NOAA weather satellites which monitor the density and distribution of ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere from six to 30 miles. SBUV/2 looks down at the Earth’s atmosphere and the reflected sunlight at wavelengths characteristic of ozone. The SBUV/2 wavelength "channels" range from 252 nanometer (nm) to 340 nm.
Ozone is measured as a ratio of sunlight incident on the atmosphere to the amount of sunlight scattered back into space. From this information, the total ozone between the instrument and the ground can be calculated. 
The SBUV/2 measures solar irradiance and Earth radiance (backscattered solar energy) in the near ultraviolet spectrum (160 to 400 nm). The SBUV is capable of determining the global ozone concentration in the stratosphere to an absolute accuracy of 1 percent; the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone to an absolute accuracy of 5 percent; the long-term solar spectral irradiance from 160 to 400 nm Photochemical process and the influence of “trace” constituents on the ozone layer.
The Ball Aerospace-built SBUV/2 helped to discover the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1987, and continues to monitor this phenomenon. Atmospheric ozone absorbs the sun’s ultraviolet rays, which are believed to cause gene mutations, skin cancer, and cataracts in humans. Ultraviolet rays may also damage crops and aquatic ecosystems. The first SBUV/2 launch was in 1984, with the last instrument in this series being launched in 2009 aboard the NOAA-19 spacecraft.

Craignaw is a small but very rocky hill in centre of the Galloway Hills of southern Scotland. Unlike many hills in the Southern Uplands, Craignaw has a complex and rocky summit area, with a long line of crags and rough ground on the east side. The hill is largely composed of granite.Geological Map of Scotland Near the north end of the hill is an interesting area of terrain known as the "Deil's Bowlin' Green" where various rounded granite boulders are scatterd at random over an area of nearly horizontal granite slabs. These are believed to be glacial erratics or result from a similar glacier process. On the west side of the hill, near grid reference NX458831, a few hundred meters from the summit is an F-111E Aardvark crash site. The site is marked by a small memorial to the two US Airforce pilots who were killed in the accident (Captains Spaulding and Hetzner).http://www.f-111.net/t_no_E.htm|F-111 site - see USAF tail number 68-0003 Although the crash happened on December 19, 1979 there are still small amounts of aircraft debris in the area.

[[Pride & Joy (comics)]]
"Pride & Joy" is a six-issue story arc from the comic book series Runaways (vol. 1), published in issues one through six in 2003 by Marvel Comics' imprint Tsunami, which was created to attract young readers.  It was written by Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by Adrian Alphona. While it was initially intended to be a six-part miniseries, the popularity of "Pride & Joy" and new ideas from writer Vaughan allowed Runaways to grow into a regular monthly Marvel title. "Pride & Joy" has subsequently won several comics awards, including the 2006 Harvey Award for Best Continuing or Limited Series.
Although the Tsunami imprint was unsuccessful, "Pride & Joy" (and the series Runaways that continued it) was one of the very few Tsunami series to do well in sales and to continue being published.  The story arc has been critically acclaimed for its simple story set in the typically complex Marvel Universe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10262.phtml|title=Review of Runaways vol. 1: Pride & Joy|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|date=2004-04-04|publisher=RPGnet Reviews|accessdate=2009-02-25[/tpl]  Vaughan is known for avoiding the clichés of the superhero genre, locating the group in Los Angeles rather than New York City, where most Marvel Comics superhero titles are set. In order to create an everyday setting and tone, Vaughan included various references to current popular culture, including television series, films, events and celebrities.
The story arc's primary purpose was to introduce the main characters, six children who discover their parents are evil after seeing them murder a girl in a sacrificial ceremony. It centers upon the children's relationships with their parents as the children learn that they themselves have inherited their parents' powers. Once The Pride realizes their offspring have disappeared, they begin to use their considerable influence to track down their sons and daughters.[tpl]cite news | author = | title = Runaways nominated for a Peach Award! | publisher = Marvel | date = 2007-06-15 | url = http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.954 | accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=4873|title=2005 Eisner Nomination Announced|last=Weiland|first=Jonah|date=2005-04-14|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-02-28[/tpl] "Pride & Joy" sets up the main concept of the series, which involves children versus their parents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=83669|title=Joss Whedon Talks Runaways|last=Brady|first=Matt|date=2006-11-06|accessdate=2008-10-31[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

The economic principle of satiationAndersen, Esben Sloth, Satiation in an Evolutionary Model of Structural Dynamics. Journal of Evolutionary Economics, Vol. 11, No. 1, 2001 is the effect whereby the more of a good one possesses the less one is willing to give up in order to get more of it. This effect is caused by diminishing marginal utility, the effect whereby the consumer gains less utility per unit of a product the more units of a product he or she consumes.
For example if someone buys a can of cola they will enjoy it. If they then buy a second one they will enjoy it less, and so forth. It can continue to the point where drinking a can of cola becomes a negative experience, and beyond.

Xue E (薛崿) was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, briefly ruling Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, then headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) after the death of his brother Xue Song.
Nothing is known about Xue E's career under his brother or events before that.  When Xue Song died in 773, after having ruled Zhaoyi Circuit effectively independently from the imperial government as its military governor (Jiedushi),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 223. Xue Song's subordinates initially wanted to support his 11-year-old son Xue Ping to succeed him.  Xue Ping pretended to agree, but one night yielded his position to Xue E, took his family, and fled back to his home territory.This was likely referring to Jiang Prefecture (絳州, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), where Xue Song's and Xue E's grandfather Xue Rengui was from.  See Book of Tang, vol. 124.  Emperor Daizong made Xue E the acting military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224.
In 775, Tian Chengsi, who governed nearby Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) and who had long had designs on Zhaoyi, induced Xue E's subordinate Pei Zhiqing (裴志清) to rise against him.  Xue E fled from Zhaoyi's headquarters at Xiang Prefecture (相州) to Ming Prefecture (洺州, in modern Handan), whose prefect Xue Jian (薛堅) was a relative, and made a petition to Emperor Daizong to allow him to report to the capital Chang'an.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225.  Emperor Daizong agreed, and when Xue E arrived at Chang'an, he wore mourning clothes and begged punishment from Emperor Daizong.  Emperor Daizong did not punish him, however.Book of Tang, vol. 124.  There was no further historical records about Xue E's activities afterwards, and it is not known when he died.

[[Up Sunday]]
CATEGORIES: BBC television comedy, 1972 British television programme debuts, British television sketch shows, Satirical television programmes

Up Sunday was a British late night comedy satire TV show shown on BBC2 that ran for 55 editions over four series from January 1972 to December 1973, featuring many comedy stars of its era.
It was a spin-off from the arts discussion show Late Night Line-Up, and created by its Programme Editor, the late Mike Hill. Initially the show featured the "long, rambling topical reflections" of Willie Rushton and James Cameron.  These were later pruned, and the cast enlarged to feature the likes of Clive James, Kenny Everett and John Wells. All broadcast late on a Sunday night. Wells said the show was "aimed at dirty minded insomniacs". The cast enacted the roles of newscasters, celebrities, pedestrians, and innocent bystanders.
Described by the Off The Telly site as "a haphazard but worthwhile review of the week with plenty of above average material and a small but loyal audience". The show was very low-budget, and considered the very "last gasp" of the sixties satire boom, featuring many of that movement's key figures. The show later broadened its talent base to go into wider and more surrealist areas.
Guests included Peter Sellers, Eric Idle, Sir John Betjeman, Spike Milligan, Ivor Cutler, Eleanor Bron, Barry Humphries, John Fortune, Max Wall, Richard Murdoch, Roy Hudd, Vivian Stanshall, Percy Edwards, Adge Cutler and The Wurzels. The show also contained musical spots, like folk singer Jake Thackray singing Brother Gorilla and Little Black Foal.[ref]

[/ref][ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
[/ref]
Preparations for the show were very loose, often with scripts being thought up at the last minute or not at all. The show had a "laid back" running order, so items could be included or dropped. Many guest appearances were down to them being friends of the cast.  Sketches included Inspector Poirot Investigates, featuring John Fortune, Percy Edwards, John Wells as Adolf Hitler and Peter Sellers.
It also had two specials, Up The Channel and Up Christmas. During the preparation for the latter, ex-Bonzo Dog Band front man Vivian Stanshall appeared as a drunk Santa Claus, appearing out of a hamper, brandishing a Bloody Mary at the camera, before he fell over, cut his hand on the glass, and blood sprayed all over the white studio floor.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]</ref><ref name="TVCream">
</ref> According to Eric Idle, the show was made "not by the Light Entertainment Department but by Presentation, which would just make announcements and say 'Here on BBC-2 ...'"<ref name="Idle">

[/ref]
The series spawned two spin-off shows. The first, The End of the Pier Show in 1974, with John Wells, John Fortune, Carl Davis, Madeline Smith, Peter Sellers, John Laurie, Ivor Cutler and John Bird. Considered highly innovative at the time, it was the first TV programme to mix cartoons with live performance. The second spin-off was In The Looking Glass in 1978. Both were produced by Mike Hill.[ref]
</ref> The show was also influential in the creation of ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]''.<ref name="Idle" />

[[Colonia Juárez, Mexico City]]
CATEGORIES: Neighborhoods in Mexico City

Colonia Juarez is one of the better–known neighborhoods or colonias in the Cuauhtémoc borough of Mexico City. The neighborhood is shaped like a long triangle with the boundaries: Paseo de la Reforma on the north, Avenida Chapultepec on the south, and Eje 1 Poniente (Bucareli Street) on the east.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cuauhtemoc.df.gob.mx/delegacion/mapa/colonias.html |title= Colonia Juarez |language= Spanish |accessdate= 2008-10-22 [/tpl]
It is located between the historic center of Mexico City and the Chapultepec Park area,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.mexicocity.com.mx/zonarosa.html |title= Zona Rosa |publisher= mexicocity.com |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 15, 2010 [/tpl] just south of the Paseo de la Reforma, which is one of Mexico’s main commercial districts and its financial center. Since it was established in the late 19th century and early 20th as a haven for the wealthy leaving the city center, the colonia has been in near constant change. Most of the mansions built in the early part of its history have either been abandoned, converted into businesses or been taken over by squatters. However, it has had a cosmopolitan and intellectual reputation since its founding, which was reinforced with the influx of artists and intellectuals in the 1960s. The area has suffered deterioration since the 1980s, due to the 1985 Mexico City earthquake and other factors, but there have been efforts to return the area’s former prestige, including tourism promotion, historic conservation efforts and the urbanization of areas close to Paseo de la Reforma.
The best known area of the colonia is Zona Rosa (Pink Zone) which is a tourist attraction for its artistic and intellectual reputation and is home to Mexico City’s gay community. It is also home to “Little Seoul,” center of the city’s Korean immigrant population.

[[Maximum cut]]

CATEGORIES: Graph theory objects, Combinatorial optimization, NP-complete problems, Computational problems in graph theory

For a graph, a maximum cut  is a cut whose size is at least the size of any other cut. The problem of finding a maximum cut in a graph is known as the max-cut problem.
The problem can be stated simply as follows.  One wants a subset S of the vertex set such that the number of edges between S and the complementary subset is as large as possible.
There is a more advanced version of the problem called weighted max-cut.  In this version each edge has a real number, its weight, and the objective is to maximize not the number of edges but the total weight of the edges between S and its complement.  The weighted max-cut problem is often, but not always, restricted to non-negative weights, because negative weights can change the nature of the problem.

X&Y is the third studio album by British alternative rock band Coldplay, released 6 June 2005 in the United Kingdom via the record label Parlophone. The album, which features influences of electronic music, was produced by the band and British record producer Danton Supple. Development of the album was often troubled; the album's original producer, British record producer Ken Nelson, was supposed to produce much of the album, however, many songs written during their sessions were ditched due to the band's dissatisfaction. The album's cover art is a combination of colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code.
The album contains twelve tracks and an additional hidden track, "Til Kingdom Come". It is omitted from the track listing on the album sleeve, but listed as "+" on the disc label and inside the album booklet. It was originally planned for American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash to record it with lead singer, Chris Martin, but Cash died before he was able to do so.[tpl]cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/interview/25476511|title=X&Y From A To Z|last=Parker|first=Lyndsey|date=11 March 2006|publisher=Yahoo! Music|accessdate=17 September 2008[/tpl] The song "Talk" appeared on the main track listing, although it was thought to have been downgraded to a B-side for the album's subsequent single releases, after it leaked online in early 2005.
X&Y was released after a considerable amount of hype and was a significant commercial success, reaching the top spot of many charts worldwide, including the United Kingdom and United States, the latter being their first. With accumulated sales of 8.3 million units in 2005 alone, X&Y was the best-selling album released in 2005 worldwide. By 2011, the album had sold over 13 million copies worldwide.http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/237358/20111025/coldplay-mylo-xyloto.htm
Overall reaction to the album has been generally positive, though some critics cited it as being inferior to its predecessors. The album spawned the singles "Speed of Sound", "Fix You", "Talk", "The Hardest Part", "What If" and "White Shadows".

Joanna Painter (Fox) Waddill (September 24, 1838 – January 3, 1899) was a nurse assisting wounded and ill Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War. She became celebrated as the "Florence Nightingale of the Confederacy" for her humanitarianism. 
Joanna Fox was born in Bristol, Pennsylvania, to James C. Fox and his wife Catherine Bessonett. Fox was a brickmason who moved his family to the Mississippi River port city of Natchez, Mississippi, when Joanna was a baby.
Fox was only 22 years old when the Civil War erupted in early 1861. She and two other Natchez ladies traveled to the front lines to serve as volunteer nurses in such places as Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. When the Union Navy captured Natchez as they advanced toward Vicksburg, Mississippi, Waddill hid a Confederate flag under her petticoat to prevent its capture.Find A Grave Retrieved 2008-10-06.
Near the end of the war, Fox became the matron of the Confederate hospital in Meridian, Mississippi. There, she met Louisiana druggist George D. Waddill while they both tended sick and dying Confederate soldiers. The couple were married in Lauderdale, Mississippi (near Corinth) on September 26, 1864.Waddill biographical webpage. Retrieved 2008-10-06.
The couple moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where they operated a drugstore for many years. She became active in the Confederate Memorial Association and other societies.
Joanna Waddill and her husband are buried in Magnolia Cemetery at Baton Rouge. Ironically, the cemetery was in the middle of the Battle of Baton Rouge. 
The Joanna Waddill Camp #294 of the Daughters of the Confederacy is named in her honor. It is active in local Civil War memorialization.Library of Louisiana State University. Retrieved 2008-10-06.

"Ten Little Injuns" is a popular song written by Septimus Winner in 1868 for the minstrel trade. It was based on an 1850s minstrel skit about one John Brown whose Indian (referring to "Native American") boy grows from "one little Injun" into "ten little Injuns," and then back to one,—, "Reviews and Literary Notices", p. 770: "We are all familiar with that John Brown whom the minstrel has immortalized as being the possessor of a diminutive youth of the aboriginal American race, who in the course of the ditty, is multiplied from 'one little Injun' into 'ten little Injuns,' and who, in a succeeding stanza, by an ingenious amphisbænic process, is again reduced to the singular number." i.e.:Wilson, "John Brown's Ten Little Injuns"

Colonel Ilya Grigoryevich Starinov ([tpl]lang-ru|Илья Григорьевич Старинов[/tpl]) (July 20 (N.S. August 2), 1900, village of Voynovo, today's Oryol Oblast – November 18, 2000) was a Soviet military officer.
Starinov joined the Red Army in 1918 and participated in the Russian Civil War. In 1921 he attended a military college for railway troops and served with the Soviet railway troops in the 1920s. He joined the staff of the Ukrainian Military district in 1930 and took part in planning partisan warfare. In 1933 he was posted to Moscow and joined the staff of the GRU. In September 1933 he attended the Military Trasport academy where he became aquainted with Michael Svechnykov.
He served with the Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War and was one of the leaders of the Soviet partisan movement during the Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945. He is known as the "grandfather of the Russian spetsnaz".
The Russian military theorist Michael Svechnykov, executed by Stalin in 1938, had previously proposed the use of very well-trained forces in unequal combat situations. This idea was realised by Ilya Starinov. The two men thought similarly about the use of such forces.
In 1945 Starinov joined the military archive, but was moved to Lvov where he took part in the conflict with the Ukrainian nationalist insurgency. He had several staff posts after 1946, concentrating on developing insurgency tactics. Starinov retired from active service in 1956, but continued lecturing at military academies and took part in writing the official history of the partisan war.

Standing in [tpl]convert|60|acre|m2[/tpl] of grounds, the Georgian style castellated house is three storeys with a seven bay frontage, the central bay flanked by full height round towers.English Heritage; architectural description of listed building
Originally named "Willersley Hall",British History on-line it was built on the slopes of Wild Cat Tor, [tpl]convert|400|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level, for the occupation of industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright by architect William Thomas, following the purchase of the estate in 1782 from Thomas Hallet Hodges for £8,864.Heritage OpenDays siteArkwright Society News
At the time of purchase there was no large house here, just a few farms and "Derwent House", which still stands off the main drive. Arkwright planted many trees, though not before clearing away a large limestone rock, which cost £3,000.Chaddesden Historical Group newsletter
In 1791, when the building was approaching completion, a fire broke out and severe damage was caused to part of the interior of the castle.  Although the damage was repaired, Arkwright died in 1792 before the building was completed.  In 1796 his son, Richard Arkwright junior, moved into it with his family, and the Arkwright family lived there until 1922.
The estate was bought in 1927 by a group of Methodist businessmen, and in 1928 it opened as a Methodist Guild holiday centre.Willersley Castle Hotel
Between 1940 and 1946, i.e. during World War II, it served as a maternity hospital run by the Salvation Army, having moved out of East London.

Chua Beng Huat ([tpl]zh|t=蔡明發|s=蔡明发|poj=Tshuà Bîng-huat[/tpl]) is a Singaporean sociologist. He is a Provost Professor and the Head of the Department of Sociology at National University of Singapore (NUS), and concurrently the Cluster Leader of the Cultural Studies in Asia program at the Asia Research Institute (ARI).
Chua did not have an early start in social sciences or humanities. Instead, he studied Biology and Chemistry in his undergraduate years. In the 1960s where college campuses in North America were fertile ground for counterculture, his involvement with student political activities made him realize that he didn’t have the right personality for natural science.http://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/soccbh/index.htm He headed to York University, Toronto, to take up Environmental Studies in 1970. A year later, he switched to Sociology and received a M.A and a PhD.‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, International Sociological Association E-Bulletin, No. 7, July 2007, p. 39.
On whether his lack of an undergraduate degree in Sociology posed an obstacle in his graduate years, Chua remarked, “Probably it was a blessing in disguise. I think if I had done undergraduate degrees in Sociology, I would have sort of glossed over lots of important theoretical readings, feeling that I already know them. Because I didn’t, I read most of the classic texts during my first year in the M.A program. That probably was foundationally the most important thing that happened. I find that with that kind of grounding substantive fields are fairly easy to take up and put down. After twenty five years, I still think that is true.” ‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, p. 40.

[[Open Bay Islands skink]]

CATEGORIES: Oligosoma, Reptiles of New Zealand

The Open Bay Islands skink (or Open Bay Island skink), Oligosoma taumakae, is a species of skink.  It was described from the Open Bay Islands, off the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. This species is diagnosed on the basis of several morphological characteristics, and its specific status is supported by mitochondrial sequence data (ND2, ND4). The new species appears to be most closely related to Oligosoma acrinasum, Oligosoma infrapunctatum, Oligosoma otagense and Oligosoma waimatense. Predation by a flightless rail, the weka, which is native to New Zealand, but was introduced to the Open Bay Islands, is a major conservation concern.Chapple, D.G.; Patterson, G.B. 2007: A new skink species (Oligosoma taumakae sp. nov.; Reptilia: Scincidae) from the Open Bay Islands, New Zealand.

In ancient Roman religion and myth, Mars ([tpl]lang-la|Mārs, Martis[/tpl]) was the god of war and also an agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 47–48. He was second in importance only to Jupiter and Neptune and he was the most prominent of the military gods in the religion of the Roman army. Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which began and ended the season for military campaigning and farming.
Under the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with the Greek god Ares,Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215. whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name of Mars. But the character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in Greek literature.Kurt A. Raaflaub, War and Peace in the Ancient World (Blackwell, 2007), p. 15. Mars was a part of the Archaic Triad along with Jupiter and Quirinus, the latter of whom as a guardian of the Roman people had no Greek equivalent. Mars' altar in the Campus Martius, the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa, the peace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome. Although the center of Mars' worship was originally located outside the sacred boundary of Rome (pomerium), Augustus made the god a renewed focus of Roman religion by establishing the Temple of Mars Ultor in his new forum.Paul Rehak and John G. Younger, Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), pp. 11–12.
Although Ares was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force, Mars represented military power as a way to secure peace, and was a father (pater) of the Roman people.Isidore of Seville calls Mars Romanae gentis auctorem, the originator or founder of the Roman people as a gens (Etymologiae 5.33.5). In the mythic genealogy and founding myths of Rome, Mars was the father of Romulus and Remus with Rhea Silvia. His love affair with Venus symbolically reconciled the two different traditions of Rome's founding; Venus was the divine mother of the hero Aeneas, celebrated as the Trojan refugee who "founded" Rome several generations before Romulus laid out the city walls.
The importance of Mars in establishing religious and cultural identity within the Roman Empire is indicated by the vast number of inscriptions identifying him with a local deity, particularly in the Western provinces.

[[Next Generation Supersonic Transport]]
CATEGORIES: Supersonic transports

The Next Generation Supersonic Transport is a supersonic transport (SST) being developed by the Japanese Space Agency JAXA.  By comparison to the Aérospatiale-BAC SST Concorde, the new design will carry three times the passengers (300), fly at roughly the same speed (Mach 2) [tpl]convert |1522.4|mph|kph|abbrv =yes[/tpl], and have twice the range.  The goal is to achieve a ticket price comparable to that of subsonic business class.  JAXA expects to launch the plane by 2015.  An 11.5-meter prototype was tested on October 10, 2005.[tpl]cite news | title = Japanese supersonic airliner is go | work = The Register | date = October 10, 2005 | url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/10/sst_test/ | accessdate=2008-11-09[/tpl]
One of the most crucial factors in the commercial viability of a supersonic transport is the strength of the sonic boom it generates.  The boom created by Concorde was powerful  enough to prevent the aircraft from flying supersonic over land, thus eliminating many possible passenger routes (and contributing to the cancellation of Concorde's American rival, the Boeing 2707).  Since the 1960s however, a number of techniques have been developed that may reduce the effect (see the sonic boom article).  On May 9, 2008, JAXA announced it would collaborate with NASA to conduct joint research on sonic boom modeling.[tpl]Citation | publisher = JAXA | type = press release | url = http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2008/05/20080509_sonic_e.html | date = May 9, 2008 | title = Sonic E | place = JP[/tpl].
JAXA is also researching hypersonic transport (Mach 5.0+) [tpl]convert|3806|mph|kph|abbrv=yes[/tpl], though the goal is not use for commercial aircraft cost competitive with current aircraft.[tpl]Citation | title = Research | place = JP | publisher = Jaxa | contribution = STT | contribution-url = http://www.apg.jaxa.jp/eng/research/stt/stt-index.html[/tpl].

CATEGORIES: Essays by George Orwell, Works originally published in Tribune (magazine), 1940s essays

"As I Please" was a series of articles written between 1943 and 1947 for the British left-wing newspaper Tribune by author and journalist George Orwell.
On resigning from his job at the BBC in November 1943, Orwell joined Tribune as literary editor. Over the next three-and-a-half years he wrote a series of columns, under the title "As I Please", that remain some of the greatest examples of their genre in the English language.Anderson, Paul (ed). Orwell in Tribune: 'As I Please' and Other Writings. Methuen/Politico's 2006. ISBN 1-84275-155-7 The articles allowed Orwell to digress freely over whatever topics came into his mind, including reminiscences, nature observations, gleanings from books and thoughts on the political situation. Each article roamed from one theme to another without any need for formal continuity but had no title indicating the content. 
The first article appeared in December 1943 and considered prevailing attitude to American servicemen in Britain. The last, in April 1947, covered the publication of social surveys by the Mass Observation research group, venereal diseases and begins the concluding section "For the last five minutes I have been gazing out of the window into the square, keeping a sharp look-out for first signs of spring".Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Secker & Warburg 1968

Jednostka Wojskowa Formoza, (en. Military Unit Formoza)  (2007-2011 Morska Jednostka Działań Specjalnych, MJDS) (en. Naval Special Operations Unit), other old names: Sekcje Działań Specjalnych Marynarki Wojennej (Polish Navy Special Operations Sections), Grupy Specjalne Płetwonurków (Special Frogmen Groups).
JWF is now part of Wojska Specjalne (1975-2008 - part of the Polish Navy). The Formoza was founded in 1975. Its first commanding officer was (now a retired) certified commander, kmdr por. dypl. Józef Rembisz. In 1974, a research team dealing with matters related to naval frogmen was created. The team was to draw up a concept for the organisation and formation of a special division of naval frogmen.
The unit was originally intended to comprise three sections of frogmen, a technical section, section and management. But it was necessary to change this premise; a frogman could not go under the water without a safety leash. It was found possible to omit this regulation. A basic team now consists of a pair formed to safeguard each other, three pairs create a special group, five groups – a section. At the very beginning, conscripted soldiers served in the unit, nowadays the unit is entirely professional, which has increased its operating effectiveness. A three-year training system was preserved, for instance, during the first year, mainly shooting, swimming long distances, driving vehicles and foreign languages are practiced.
In September 1987, the unit changed its name to Special Operations Department and the Special Naval Frogman Groups were created in 1990. The unit has formidable striking power, two frogmen may sink or take control of an enemy’s ship, several of them may block even a large group of ships. The current official name Formoza comes from a Polish Navy seamen nickname of unit's training base "Formoza" (from relation between mainland, coast and island like PRC and ROC Taiwan - Formosa) - a former WW2 German torpedo test platform, 500 m away from coast in Gdynia Naval Harbour (Formoza means Formosa in Polish).

[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 books, Postanarchism, Books about anarchism, Philosophy books

From Bakunin to Lacan: Anti-Authoritarianism and the Dislocation of Power is a  book on political philosophy by Saul Newman, published in 2001. It investigates the essential characteristics of anarchist theory, which holds that government and hierarchy are undesirable forms of social organisation. Newman seeks to move beyond the limitations these characteristics impose on classical anarchism by using concepts from post-structuralist thought.
By applying post-structuralist theory to anarchism, Newman presents an account of post-anarchism. His post-anarchism is more substantive than that of earlier thinkers, and has influenced later approaches to the philosophy. Released in a climate of an anarchist movement hostile to postmodern philosophy, From Bakunin to Lacan was criticised for its poor understanding of and engagement with contemporary anarchism.

[[Fighting Discrimination]]

CATEGORIES: Human rights organizations

The Fighting Discrimination Program of Human Rights First focuses on the violence known as hate crimes or bias crimes. Because equality is a cornerstone of human rights protection, discrimination in all its forms is a violation of human rights. Discrimination can take the form of violence generated by prejudice and hatred founded upon a person’s race, ethnicity, religious belief, sexual orientation, gender, disability, or other such factors.right|thumb|2008 Hate Crime Survey, written by Human Rights First's Fighting Discrimination Program.     
Through the Fighting Discrimination Program, Human Rights First seeks to combat discrimination by reversing the tide of antisemitic, anti-immigrant, and anti-Muslim violence and reducing other bias crime in North America, Europe, and the Russian Federation.
In this effort, the Program looks at both the reality of violence driven by discrimination in each country and at two principal ways in which this violence can best be confronted. 
The first is through hate crimes legislation and effective and equitable enforcement of criminal law to protect often vulnerable minorities. The Program's premise is that hate crimes should be treated as the exceptional crimes that they are and prosecuted as such, including with enhanced penalties.  
Second, the fight against discrimination requires the monitoring and statistical reporting of incidents and crimes in which bias is an element – in order to provide analytical tools for policy makers and effective action to confront violence. Official anti-discrimination bodies can play a pivotal role in ensuring that monitoring occurs and effective anti-discrimination policies are then implemented.

Almost all kinds of tree found in the Celtic countries have been thought to have special powers or to serve as the abode of the fairies, especially the magical trio of oak, ash, and thorn. Next in rank are the fruit-bearing trees apple and hazel, followed by the alder, elder, holly, and willow. The esteem given different trees varies in different parts of the Celtic world; on the Isle of Man, the phrase ‘fairy tree’ denotes the tramman elder.McKillop, James (1998). ‘Fairy tree.’ A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology.

CATEGORIES: 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, 2008 in Mexico, Atlantic hurricanes in Mexico, Atlantic tropical storms

Tropical Storm Marco was the smallest tropical cyclone on record. The thirteenth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean during late September 2008. Influenced by a tropical wave on October 4, a small low-level circulation center developed over Belize. After crossing the southern end of the Yucatán Peninsula and emerging into the Bay of Campeche, the low was declared Tropical Depression Thirteen early on October 6. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Marco later that day. Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of [tpl]convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] early on October 7. Around this time, tropical storm force winds extended [tpl]convert|11.5|mi|km[/tpl] from the center of the storm, making Marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record. Around 1200 UTC, Marco made landfall near Misantla, Veracruz. The storm rapidly weakened after landfall, dissipating later that day. Due to its small size, Marco caused minimal damage; however, the storm's heavy rains led to floods up to [tpl]convert|10|ft|m|2[/tpl] deep that covered highways and damaged homes.

[[Charlotte Mary Brame]]
CATEGORIES: 1836 births, 1884 deaths, 19th-century English writers, English women novelists, 19th-century women writers, People from Hinckley

Charlotte Mary Brame (usually known as Charlotte M. Brame, last name sometimes mistakenly given as Braeme; appeared under pseudonyms in America, notably Bertha M. Clay, and was sometimes identified by the name of her most famous novel, Dora Thorne) (November 1, 1836 - November 25, 1884) was an English novelist.
She was born in Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Benjamin and Charlotte Agnes Law, devout Roman Catholics. After attending convent schools in Bristol and Preston and a finishing school in Paris, she worked as a governess before marrying Phillip Edward Brame (1839–1886), a London-based jeweler, on January 7, 1863. The couple had nine children, of which four lived to adulthood. Since Brame was a poor businessman and a drunkard, Charlotte found herself forced to support the family with her writing. Her books were very successful with the public, but her earnings were severely diminished by piracy, particularly in the United States. The family lived in London, Manchester, and Brighton before returning to Hinckley, where she died in 1884. She owed money at her death, and her children were taken into guardianship; her husband committed suicide in May 1886.
Her biographer, Gregory Drozdz, writes: Her stories appeared in popular weekly publications such as Bow Bells, the London Reader, and the Family Herald. She was incredibly prolific, writing somewhere in the region of 130 novels during her lifetime. Charlotte Brame's fiction was invariably set in English country houses... Against this milieu, she reworked the theme of love in all of its multifarious aspects—old love, young love, jealousy, suspicion, misalliance, and improvident marriage. High morals such as honour, a sense of duty, and self-sacrifice are lauded as the greatest of virtues. The books also contain strong descriptive passages, some of which are drawn from her associations with Leicestershire... Her literary endeavours, in a male-dominated field, her works of charity, and her personal stamina and resilience, in the face of family tragedy and ill health, represent a triumph in adversity.Gregory Drozdz, "Brame, Charlotte Mary (1836–1884)," Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004)

[[Bonnie Consolo]]
CATEGORIES: 1938 births, 2005 deaths, People from Menifee County, Kentucky, People from Columbus, Ohio, People without hands

Bonnie J. Consolo (October 12, 1938 - December 27, 2005), née Bonnie Jean Pflug, was a Kentucky native and motivational speaker who was born without hands or arms. Consolo was the third of five children born to Wendell & Ruby (Sorrell) Pflug, and the only one with born with a disability in the family.  
Consolo was raised on her parents' farm in rural Kentucky, and graduated from high school in Frenchburg, Kentucky. Consolo tried artificial arms; however, she found them uncomfortable and never acclimated to them. She married Frank Consolo in 1966 near Hayward, California.
Consolo's life captured the attention of the American media in the 1970s when the independent documentary film A Day in the Life of Bonnie Consolo was released in 1975.  At the time, Consolo was a housewife living in Columbus, Ohio with her husband Frank and their two young sons, Mark and Matthew.  The film received an Academy Award nomination on February 12, 1976 for Live Action Short Film.[tpl]cite web |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1225472521210 |title=48th Academy Award nominees and winners |accessdate=2008-10-31 |work= |publisher=oscars.org |date= [/tpl]
The release of the film led Mike Wallace of CBS's 60 Minutes news program to interview Consolo for the program.  During the interview Consolo was shown tending for her children and driving (her automobile was not modified for her disability) while doing errands, and shown preparing food and cooking the family meal while seated on a stool, using her feet to wash and peel vegetables. Because of ideas about what those with disabilities were thought unable to do, the scene of Consolo cooking was considered a revelation to the viewing public. When queried by Wallace about what she thought viewers would think of a woman handling food with her feet, Consolo quickly countered that she washed her feet more frequently than most people washed their own hands. The episode concluded with film of Consolo driving Wallace to Port Columbus International Airport in her Cadillac.
Following its initial airing, the segment became one of the program's most popular interviews, and went on to become one of the show's most heavily requested repeat segments.  Wallace would later say that Consolo was one of his most unforgettable people during his time on 60 Minutes.
Consolo undertook public speaking appearances talking about her experiences in life, and speaking on the rights of those with physical limitations.
Consolo later divorced her husband and returned to her native Kentucky where she completed her college education, earning a BA degree in psychology from Morehead State University. In 1986 she married Ronald M. Duncan in Montgomery County, Kentucky. In 1993 she self-published her autobiography, Bonnie, an Autobiography.
Bonnie J. Consolo died in Lexington, Kentucky on December 27, 2005. Her ashes were scattered in the Red River Gorge.

[[Suspicions about the Hidden Realities of the Air]]

CATEGORIES: Alchemical documents

Suspicions about the Hidden Realities of the Air is a book on alchemy by 17th Century philosopher Robert Boyle. It was written in 1674 concerning ideas about the agency of the air in chemical reactions. Air at this time was considered homogenous, empty and inactive.
 I have often suspected, that there may be in the Air some yet more latent Qualities or Powers differing enough from all these, and principally due to the Substantial Parts or Ingredients, whereof it consists.
 For this is not as many imagine a simple and elementary body, but a confused aggregate of 'effluviums' from such differing bodies, that, though they all agree in constituting by their minuteness and various motions one great mass of fluid matter, yet perhaps there is scarce a more heterogeneous body in the world.[ref]
J. F. Fulton. Robert Boyle and His Influence on Thought in the Seventeenth Century. Isis, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Jul., 1932), pp. 77-102. Published by: The University of Chicago Press on behalf of The History of Science Society[/ref]

Although his research and personal philosophy clearly has its roots in the alchemical tradition, Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry. It was by examining the part played by the air in processes of calcination and burning that men at last became able to give approximately complete descriptions of these processes, which led to the gradual scientific rejection of Phlogiston.[tpl]cite book |first=M.M.P. |last=Muir |year=1992 |origyear=1902 |title=Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry |publisher=Kessinger |isbn=9781564590190 |lccn=03001600 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UtU07VGNaioC&pg=PA157 |page=157[/tpl]
Among Boyle's more popular works is The Sceptical Chymist, seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry.

"One who calls himself a Gursikh of the True Guru, shall rise in the early morning hours and meditate on the Lord's Name."

A Gursikh does not cut hair or trim beard. He does not take alcohol. He never bows before anyone other than Guru Granth Sahib. A Gursikh man can be identified as a person with unshorn hair, flowing beard and turban. A Gursikh may be Amritdhari or non Amritdhari, but must keep unshorn hair. He often visits Gurdwara Sahib. He is fond of doing sewa & simran.

gurasikh meeth chalahu gur chaalee
O Sikhs of the Guru, O friends, walk on the Guru's Path.
Guru's path means the three concepts of Sikhism: 
1) Naam Japna - Meditation on the Divine Name

2) Kirat Karna - Earning an honest living

3) Vand chhakna - Sharing your earnings with the needy

Achille C. Varzi (born May 8, 1958, Galliate) is an Italian-born philosopher. He teaches at Columbia University, where he has been a member of the philosophy faculty since 1995.
Varzi has made notable contributions to the fields of philosophical logic (mainly vagueness, supervaluationism, paraconsistency, formal semantics) and metaphysics (mainly mereology and mereotopology, causation, events, and issues relating to identity and persistence through time). His first book, Holes and Other Superficialities (1994, with Roberto Casati), was an exploration of the realist ontology of common sense and naive physics. His more recent work is inspired by a nominalist-conventionalist stance.
Varzi is currently an editor of The Journal of Philosophy and an advisory editor of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Varzi is also a prolific writer for the general public and contributes regularly to several Italian newspapers.
Achille C. Varzi is a second cousin of the Italian racecar driver Achille Varzi.

[[Caenagnathoidea]]

CATEGORIES: Oviraptorosaurs

Caenagnathoidea ("recent jaw forms") is a group of advanced oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period of what are now Asia and North America. They are distinct for their characteristically short, beaked, parrot-like skulls, often with bony crests atop the head. They ranged in size from Caudipteryx, which was the size of a turkey, to the 8 meter long, 1.4 ton Gigantoraptor.Xu, X., Tan, Q., Wang, J., Zhao, X., and Tan, L. (2007). "A gigantic bird-like dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of China." Nature, 447: 844-847. The group (along with all maniraptoran dinosaurs) is close to the ancestry of birds. The most complete specimens have been found in Asia, representing members of the sub-group Oviraptorinae. Notable but fragmentary remains are also known from North America, almost all of which belong to the subgroup Elmisaurinae.Varricchio, D. J. 2001. Late Cretaceous oviraptorosaur (Theropoda) dinosaurs from Montana. pp. 42–57 in D. H. Tanke and K. Carpenter (eds.), Mesozoic Vertebrate Life. Indiana University Press, Indianapolis, Indiana.
The earliest definitive caenangnathoid is Microvenator celer, which dates to the late Aptian age of the early Cretaceous period, though the slightly earlier Caudipteryx from the lower Yixian Formation of China, may also be a member of this group.

The station is located in a currently unbuilt area of Lelystad. In 1988, this area was planned to be developed heavily for residential purposes, but demand for houses in Lelystad was not as big as previously thought and the planned neighbourhood of Warande was never built. 
However, towards the end of 2008, construction at Warande started again and it was initially hoped that the construction will be completed between 2015 and 2020. In February 2011, Nederlandse Spoorwegen said it does not expect to use the station before 2025.

The Zenú  or Sinú is an Amerindian tribe in Colombia, whose ancestral territory comprises the valleys of the Sinu and San Jorge rivers as well as the coast of the Caribbean around the Gulf of Morrosquillo. These lands lie within the departments of Córdoba and Sucre.
The Zenú culture existed from about 200 BCE to about 1600 CE, constructing major water works and producing gold ornaments. The gold that was often buried with their dead lured the Spanish conquerors, who looted much of the gold. With the arrival of the Spaniards, the tribe all but died out. The 16th-century Spanish chroniclers wrote about the Zenú who were still living there, but recorded little or nothing about the history of the Zenú. 
In 1966 the geographer James Parsons drew attention to rake-like patterns that were visible on aerial photographs of the wetlands in the lower reaches of the river San Jorge,JJ Parsons e.a.

Toxoptera citricida (syn. Toxoptera citricidus) is a species of aphid known by the common names brown citrus aphid, black citrus aphid, and oriental citrus aphid. It is a pest of citrus and vector for the pathogenic plant virus citrus tristeza virus. The aphid spread the virus through citrus groves in Brazil and Venezuela in the 1970s, leading to the near destruction of the citrus industry there.  A review of the literature on Toxoptera citricida (Kirkaldy) (Homoptera: Aphididae). Florida Entomologist 81:1 37-61. This aphid was first discovered in Florida in 1995.Center for Invasive Species Research
The adult aphid is shiny black and wingless (aptera) or winged (alate or alatoid), and the nymph is dark reddish brown. The aphid feeds on new buds and leaves. The virus is transmitted when the aphid introduces it into the phloem of the plant.Featured Creatures
In most parts of the world, there is no sexual reproductive stage in the autumn as there is in other aphid species and there are no males and no eggs. All the individuals are viviparous parthenogenetic females all year round. Populations increase very rapidly when the conditions are favourable. The nymphs mature in about a week at temperatures of 20 °C or higher.Komazaki S. 1987. Growth and reproduction in the first two and summer generations of two citrus aphids, Aphis citricola van der Goot and Toxoptera citricidus (Kirkaldy) (Homoptera: Aphididae), under different thermal conditions.

The men's 10,000 metres event was part of the track and field athletics programme at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The competition was held on Sunday, July 6, 1924.
Paavo Nurmi the greatest long-distance runner at that time did not compete in this race, as the Finnish officials asked him not to start in this event. They thought he was entered in too many competitions. Only a few weeks after the Olympics on August 31 Nurmi set a new world record with 30:06.2 in Kuopio.
As for all other races the track was 500 metres in circumference.
The exact number of starters is unknown, but photographs show around 35 competitors. At least 33 - maybe 36 - long-distance runners from 16 nations competed.

The TKS spacecraft was intended to be used as a resupply craft for Almaz space stations and saw some test flights in the Salyut space station program. The TKS spacecraft was formed by mating a FGB with a VA spacecraft, with both the VA and the FGB being capable of independent operation.
Following the development of the FGB for the TKS spacecraft, the FGB (without VA spacecraft) formed the basis for space station modules in the Soviet and Russian space program – these space station modules are to some extent called Functional Cargo Block (FGB) as well, like the Zarya FGB module.[tpl]cite web|title=TKS transport ship 11F72|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/tks.html|publisher=RussianSpaceWeb.com|accessdate=30 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=TKS|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/tks.htm|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=31 August 2012[/tpl]
The FGB provides "functional" support in the form of electrical power, propulsion, guidance and docking; The support for "cargo" operations is supplied in the form of a pressurized habitable cargo storage section (accessible by the crew) and the externally mounted fuel tanks.

[[Chiwen]]
CATEGORIES: Chinese architecture, Chinese architectural history, Chinese culture, Chinese dragons, Chinese words and phrases

Chiwen ([tpl]zh|c=螭吻|p=chīwěn|w=ch'ih-wen|l=hornless-dragon mouth[/tpl]) is a chinese dragon, and one of the 9 sons of the dragon in Chinese mythology. He is depicted in imperial roof decorations and other ornamental motifs in traditional Chinese architecture and art.
This Chinese dragon name chiwen 螭吻 compounds chi 螭 "hornless dragon; young dragon" and wen 吻 "(animal's) mouth; lips; kiss". Chishou 螭首 and Chitou 螭頭 (both literally meaning "hornless-dragon head") are related architectural ornaments or waterspouts, comparable with Western gargoyles. Chiwen and Chishou are not the character in chinese mythology.
Chiwen 螭吻 is alternatively written chiwen 鴟吻 ("owl mouth"), using the homophonous Chinese character chi 鴟 "owl; sparrowhawk; bird of prey". The chiwei 鴟尾 ("owl tail") and chimeng 鴟甍 ("owl roof-ridge") are additional birdlike roof decorations.
The chiwen is listed second or third among the Long sheng jiuzi 龍生九子 ("dragon gives birth to nine young"), Nine Dragons ([tpl]zh|c=九龙|p=jiǔlóng[/tpl]), which are tranditional mythology creatures and become traditional Chinese fengshui architectural decorations. Each one of those creatures have a protective function. The Nine dragon are also used to name lot of place, lika Kowloon (nine dragon in cantonese), in Hong Kong, but also numerous lakes, rivers or hamlets in mainland China.
According to the Ming Dynasty Wuzazu 五雜俎 (tr. Visser 1913:101), "The ch'i-wen, which like swallowing, are placed on both ends of the ridgepoles of roofs (to swallow all evil influences)."
Welch describes chiwen as "the dragon who likes 'to swallow things'".
 This is the fish-like, hornless dragon with a very truncated body and large, wide mouth usually found along roof ridges (as if swallowing the roof beams). His presence on roofs is also said to guard against fires. A paragraph in the Tang dynasty book Su Shi Yan Yi (苏氏演义) by Su E (苏鹗) says that a mythical sea creature called the chi wen [tpl]sic[/tpl] was put on the roofs of buildings during the Han dynasty to protect the structures from fire hazards. This dragon is still found on the roofs of traditional Chinese homes today, protecting the inhabitants from fires. (2008:122-3)  
In Fengshui theory, a chiwen or chiwei supposedly protects against not only fire, but also flood and typhoon.
The Japanese language borrowed these names for architectural roof decorations as Sino-Japanese vocabulary. Shibi 鴟尾 "ornamental roof-ridge tile" is more commonly used than chifun 螭吻 or shifun 鴟吻. In Japanese mythology, the Shachihoko 鯱 "a mythical fish with a carp's arched tail, tiger's head, and dragon's scales" roof decoration is believed to cause rain and protect against fire. This 鯱 is a kokuji "Chinese character invented in Japan" that can also be read shachi for "orca".

[[Province building]]
CATEGORIES: Canadian political phrases, Provincial and territorial government in Canada, Regionalism (politics), Political science terms

Province building is a term in Canadian political science which refers to the efforts of provincial governments to become prominent actors in lives of, and focus of loyalty for, people living within those provinces.  It is related both to nation-building, process of constructing or structuring a national identity using the power of the state, and state-building, enhancing the capacity of state institutions and building state-society relations.
The Canadian constitution, is federal and gives the provinces important powers.  These powers have been expanded over time by judicial rulings and successful provincial lobbying.  Surveys of public opinion in Canada show that healthcare and education rank as the "most important issues" in the minds of Canadians, and both those spheres are delegated to the provinces.
Canadian provinces are also endowed with many symbols and myths that attract loyalty in much the same way as do nation states.  Many of them had long histories as separate British colonies before joining Canada.  They have distinct flags and coats of arms, official provincial institutions such as museums, and separate media markets that cater to provincial affairs.  Furthermore, their provincial heads of government, the premiers, are often considered the provinces' representatives in national affairs, called "executive federalism".  This contrasts with other federations such as the United States and Australia where the upper house of the legislature is considered to be responsible for defending the rights of the states against the federal government.
Provincial loyalties also intersect with ethnic and linguistic ones.  This is most true of Quebec, where the provincial government views itself as the gurantor of the "national" culture of Quebec.  Quebec nationalists often view the provincial government as the basis on which to build the État québécois, the Quebec State.  Political movements in other provinces have also tried to use the provincial government as a force to build provincial autonomy and safeguard local identity.  For example in the 1930s the province of Alberta sought to print its own currency and impose regulations on the major banks, which were all based outside of the province.  From the 1940s to the 1970s the government of Saskatchewan attempted to build a social democratic society in that province, and "nationalized" or "provincialized" many industries including auto and medical insurance, electricity generation, telecommunications, and potash mining.

CATEGORIES: 1943 NCAA football season

The 1943 NCAA football season concluded with the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame crowned as the nation’s #1 team by a majority of the voters in the AP Poll, followed by the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks as the runner-up.  For the third time in the history of the AP Poll, a team that had lost a game was named mythical national champion; (Minnesota 1936 and Ohio State 1942). Notre Dame lost its final game of the season, a Chicago contest against the Great Lakes Naval Training Center.  Along the way, however, the Fighting Irish had played one of the toughest college schedules ever, beating two #2 ranked teams (Michigan and Iowa Pre-Flight) and two #3 ranked teams (Navy and Army).
In 1943, as many as 131 sportswriters participated in the AP poll, which included, for the first time, “service teams“.  Drawn from flight schools and training centers for participants in World War II, the service teams played against the colleges.  At the same time, a number of universities suspended their football programs.  Most of the members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) -- Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Mississippi State, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt -- did not field teams in 1943.  In addition, Pacific Coast Conference teams Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State, and Stanford, did not play, nor did Boston College, the Citadel, Duquesne, Fordham, Harvard, Michigan State, Syracuse, and William & Mary.

The 1978 Gator Bowl was a college football bowl game played between the Ohio State Buckeyes and Clemson Tigers on December 29, 1978.
This game proved to be coach Woody Hayes' last game at OSU as well as his last game as a college football coach. With just over two minutes left in the game, OSU trailed 17-15. Ohio State quarterback Art Schlichter threw a pass that sailed wide of an Ohio State back and was intercepted by Clemson Middle Guard Charlie Bauman. Bauman ran towards the OSU sideline avoiding tackles and was finally shoved out of bounds, but after he got up coach Hayes punched Bauman through his face mask.[tpl]cite news |author=Fineman, Alex |title=Hayes produced champions, controversy |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Hayes_Woody.html |work=ESPN Classic |accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Woody Hayes KO'd himself in 1978 Gator Bowl |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/dec/27/20041227-124047-2522r/ |work=The Washington Times |date=December 27, 2004 |accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl] The next day Ohio State fired Hayes after 28 seasons as the Buckeyes head coach.

George Edward MacKenzie Skues, usually known as G. E. M. Skues (1858 – 1949), was a British lawyer, author and fly fisherman most noted for the invention of modern-day nymph fishing and the controversy it caused with the Chalk stream dry fly doctrine developed by Frederic M. Halford. His second book, The Way of a Trout with the Fly (1921) is considered a seminal work on nymph fishing methodology. According to Dr Andrew Herd, the British fly fishing historian, Skues:
[tpl]quotation|was, without any doubt, one of the greatest trout fishermen that ever lived. His achievement was the invention of fly fishing with the nymph, a discovery that put a full stop to half a century of stagnation in wet fly fishing for trout, and formed the bedrock for modern sunk fly fishing. Skues' achievement was not without controversy, and provoked what was perhaps the most bitter dispute in fly fishing history.|Dr. Andrew HerdFly fishing history-G. E. M. Skues[/tpl]
Paul Schullery, the American fly fishing historian, characterizes Skues in Skues on Trout as:
[tpl]quotation|...Skues has been described not only as the father of nymph fishing, but as the greatest fly fisher who ever lived.  He was also a modest, humorous and warmly accessible writer whose writings never lost sympathy for this his fellow anglers.  His self-deprecating and deceptively simple-sounding writings on trout and fly fishing remain among the wisest and most revealing in the sport's enormous literature.|Paul Schullery, Skues on Trout, 2007[tpl]cite book |last=Skues |first=George Edward MacKenzie |editor=Schullery, Paul |title=Skues on Trout-Observations from and Angler Naturalist |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |year=2007 |isbn=0-8117-0358-4 |pages=x[/tpl][/tpl]
John Goddard in The Essential G. E. M. Skues wrote:
[tpl]quotation|...I still look on Skues with considerable awe as, with out doubt, the greatest thinking fly fisher ever to put pen to paper.

The movement gained momentum with the support from Arya Samaj and its founding father Swami Dayananda Saraswati. Swami Dayananda and his followers travelled across India which led to the establishment of cow protection societies in various regions of India starting at 1882.  In 1893, during the peak of this movement and immediately after an order from a British magistrate who asked Muslims who wanted to sacrifice to register, violence broke out in Mau in Azamgarh district which in the following months culminated in riots across Northern India spreading its tentacles  all the way to Bombay and Rangoon.
The movement antagonised many Muslims, who saw it as a Hindu tool of oppression.

[[Old National Pike]]
CATEGORIES: U.S. Highway System, U.S. Route 40

Old National Pike or Old National Road, and sometimes Old Cumberland Road, Old Route 40, Old U.S. 40 are terms both colloquially and officially applied to bypassed parts of the United States' first federally funded highway (1811), the National Pike
which are essentially the parts of U.S. Route 40 (1920s) west of Baltimore and east of Missouri. Terms such as the 'Old National Pike' and 'Old National Road' are similar terms frequently built into the local business structure as official addresses, in advertising and generally refer to older roadway parts (passing through congested business or residential neighborhoods) which have been replaced by newer, more convenient highways or in most cases modern multi-lane super-highways. 
As the first National Highway, with the first ever congressional funding for a U.S. road, the highway grew with the nation. When the Interstate Highway system was funded, and sometimes locally as some cities, counties or states improved their own local highway networks, stretches of road containing a lot of turns, frequent stops (traffic signals), and-or narrow hard to widen ways and roadbeds, stretches of local roads became bypassed and locally named "Old National Pike". This is a partial list of those ambiguous names about the United States:
Eight stretches of older highways, Bannered routes of U.S. Route 40, have been granted federal support to maintain and sign by-passed roads as named variant of nearby wider U.S. 40 routes; the route markers carry not only U.S. 40 designations, but auxiliary signs such as: "Alternate", "Business", "Truck", "Scenic", etc. Some of these varieties of'' 'Old National Pike' are linked below.

[[USS Rattlesnake (1813)]]

CATEGORIES: Ships built in Massachusetts, Brigs of the United States Navy, Captured ships, Privateers, 1813 ships

USS ''Rattlesnake'' was a brig built in Medford, Massachusetts as a privateer and purchased by the United States Navy in 1813. She sailed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire 10 January 1814, under the command of Master Commandant John O. Creighton, and sailed with [tpl]USS|Enterprise|1799|2[/tpl] cruising the Caribbean. The two ships took three prizes prior to their separation which was forced by a more heavily gunned British ship on 25 February. 
Rattlesnake, fleeing back to more friendly waters, put into Wilmington, North Carolina on 9 March. together, Rattlesnake and enterprise had taken five prizes:Lloyd's List,http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1814/05-31-1814.jpg.
Rattlesnake was soon back at sea under the command of Lt. James Renshaw. She apparently captured some eight merchant vessels in the eastern Atlantic, north of the equator. On 31 May she encountered a British frigate, but escaped by throwing all but two of her guns overboard. She then captured two more merchant vessels.
In June she captured and destroyed the John, Geddes, master, which had been sailing from Liverpool to Oporto.Lloyd's Listhttp://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1814/07-12-1814.jpg - accessed 24 November 2014. the Before 11 July she captured and destroyed the Crown Prince of Poole, Street, master, which had been sailing from Newfoundland to Alicante.Lloyd's List, 12 August 1814http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1814/08-12-1814.jpg - accessed 24 November 2013.
Rattlesnake[tpl]'[/tpl]s depredations ended (arguable) on 22 June when the 50-gun British frigate [tpl]HMS|Leander|1813|6[/tpl] captured her off Cape Sable, the southern point of the island of the same name which lies off Nova Scotia. Poor weather negated any slight edge in speed and gave the advantage to the heavier frigate.
The letter from Captain George Collier of Leander is dated 11 July and states that Rattlesnake was armed with 22 guns, all of which she had thrown overboard during the chase, and that she had a crew of 131 men.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=16941|startpage=1964|date=1 October 1814[/tpl]
The records of the Vice admiralty court at Halifax give the date of capture as 7 July, which is more consistent with the letter reporting the capture than is 22 June. It is also more consistent with the report in Lloyd's List that Rattlesnake went into Halifax on 13 July.Lloyd's List, 12 August 1814http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1814/08-09-1814.jpg - accessed 24 November 2013. 
In any case, the Halifax Dockyard reported on 31 July 1814 that the Royal Navy had purchased the vessel. However, no further record exists.Winfield (2008), p.323.

All City is the fourth studio album from Western Australian hip hop group, Downsyde. It was released in October 2008 through their new label, Illusive Sounds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://illusive.com.au/newsletter/03/|title=Illusive November Newsletter|publisher=Illusive Sounds|accessdate=2008-11-17[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mushroommusic.com.au/news/472/new-signing-downsyde|title=News Archive|publisher=Mushroom Music Publishing|date=2008-08-29|accessdate=2008-11-17[/tpl]
This album differs from the group's previous efforts in that it doesn't focus on Australian guest MCs, other than the appearance of Porsah Laine.
 "With this album we wanted to feature vocalists of a different sort, and we felt that with certain tracks we wanted a chorus or a hook that could mould quite easily into our vocals. We didn't want obvious choices, we wanted vocalists that engage you straight away.  We wanted things to smack the listener in the head, like being hit by a baseball bat." - Optamus[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drumperth.com.au/|title=Fortune & Fame|publisher=The Drum Media|date=2008-10-16|last=Schlechte|first=Ted|accessdate=2008-10-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019230020/http://www.drumperth.com.au/| archivedate= 19 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] 
 "I said in passing to Armee, 'Dude let's try to get him (Guru) on a track.' So I said 'Let's just get in contact with his tour manager and send him When the Dust Settles and see what he has to say.' I though that there was no harm in trying.  Sure enough, the tour manager contacted us, and Daz ran off something like 30 beats onto a CD and we express posted it over to him as soon as we could.  There was one beat on there that he was really feeling (which eventually transformed into "Watucamehere 4") and before going back to the States he had one layover day.  The heavens opened up and on that Sunday we went 'bang let's book a studio and knock it out.'  On that Sunday I was hungover, but there - we were in the studio with Mr. Guru, slash Jazzmatazz, himself." - Optamus

Convergent evolution—the evolution of similar traits in unrelated lineages (usually geographically distant)—is rife in nature, as illustrated by the examples below. The ultimate cause of convergence is usually a similar evolutionary biome, as similar environments will select for similar traits in any species occupying the same ecological niche, even if those species are only distantly related. In the case of cryptic species, it can create species which are only distinguishable by analysing their genetics.  Unrelated organisms often develop analogous structures by adapting to similar environments.

The Monnett Moni is a sport aircraft developed in the United States in the early 1980s and marketed for homebuilding. 
Designed by John Monnett, who coined the term "Air Recreation Vehicle" to describe it, it was a single-seat motorglider with a low, cantilever wing and a V-tail. Construction was of metal throughout, and it was intended to be easy and inexpensive to build and fly.  Like many sailplanes, the main undercarriage was a single monowheel, which in this case was mounted in a streamlined fairing beneath the fuselage and was not retractable, with a steerable tailwheel behind it. Builders were also given the option of constructing their example with fixed tricycle undercarriage.Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1984-85, 756 Power was provided by a small two-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air-cooled engine.
Examples of the Moni are on display at the Steven F.

USS ''Zirkel'' (ID-3407) was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
SS Zirkel was built in 1918 at Oakland, California, for the United States Shipping Board by the Moore Shipbuilding Company. The U.S. Navy acquired her on 27 September 1918 for World War I service with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, assigned her Identification Number (Id. No.) 3407, and commissioned her the same day as USS Zirkel (Id. No. 3407) at San Francisco, California, with Lieutenant Commander David R. Williams, USNRF, in command.
Zirkel got underway for the Gulf of Mexico with a cargo of nitrates. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 30 January 1919 and unloaded her cargo.
Following repairs to her turbines, Zirkel filled her holds with cotton, coffee, and steel and put to sea on 6 February 1919. After a 21-day voyage, she entered port at Liverpool, England, and began unloading her cargo.
Zirkel then took on about 800 tons of iron ore and headed back to the United States on 13 March 1919. On 29 March 1919, the freighter arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and, after unloading, began preparations for demobilization. 
On 3 May 1919, Zirkel was decommissioned and was returned to the custody of the United States Shipping Board, once again becoming SS Zirkel. The Shipping Board retained her until she was scrapped at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1929.

Ronn Dwayne Reynolds (born September 28, 1958 in Wichita, Kansas) was a Major League Baseball catcher, who played for the New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, Houston Astros and San Diego Padres.  After playing college baseball at the University of Arkansas, Reynolds was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 5th round in 1979.[tpl]cite web|title=Ronn Reynolds - The Baseball Cube|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/R/Ronn-Reynolds.shtml|accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl]  After not signing with the Athletics, he was again drafted in the 5th round in 1980, this time by the Mets.  Reynolds played 51 games for two of the Mets' class-A minor league teams, getting 29 hits in 149 at bats.[tpl]cite web|title=Ronn Reynolds Met Minor League Stats|url=http://www.ultimatemets.com/profile.php?PlayerCode=0334&tabno=1&subtab=m|accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl]
In 1981, Reynolds was promoted to the Mets' class-AA team in Jackson.  There he played 88 games, getting 272 at-bats and posting a batting average of .235, a slugging percentage of .309 and an on-base percentage of .314.  He repeated at Jackson in 1982, improving to a .255 batting average, a .360 slugging percentage and a .344 on-base percentage in 123 games and 431 at-bats.
His 1982 performance earned him a late season promotion to the Mets.  He made his major league debut for the Mets on September 29, 1982 against the Chicago Cubs.[tpl]cite web|title=Ronn Reynolds Mets Game Log|url=http://www.ultimatemets.com/profile.php?tabno=4&PlayerCode=0334|accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl]  In total, he played 2 games for the Mets in 1982, going hitless in 4 at-bats.[tpl]cite web|title=Ronn Reynolds - Baseball Reference|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/r/reynoro02.shtml|accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl]
In 1983, Reynolds split the season between the Mets and their class-AAA affiliate in Tidewater.  He played with the Mets from April 27 through June 13, playing 24 games and getting 66 at-bats.  He posted a .197 batting average, a .280 slugging percentage and a .212 on-base percentage.  As a catcher, he allowed 27 stolen bases in 38 attempts.[tpl]cite web|title=Ronn Reynolds Baseball Prospectus|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/dt/reynoro02.php|accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  The Mets television and radio announcers often commented in the unusual spelling of his first name (with two n's) when he came to bat that season.  During his time with Tidewater, he played 40 games, getting 128 at-bats, posting a .211 batting average, a .273 slugging percentage and a .246 on-base percentage.
Reynolds spent the entire 1984 season with Tidewater, posting a batting average of .261, a slugging percentage of .418 and an on-base percentage of .303 in 90 games and 280 at bats.  His 11 home runs that season were a career high as a professional.  Although he started the 1985 season at Tidewater, playing 3 games there, he was promoted to the Mets early in the season to back up Gary Carter.  He played 28 games for the Mets, with a batting average of .209, a slugging percentage of .227 and an on-base percentage of .256 in 43 at-bats.  He allowed just 10 stolen bases in 19 attempts.  In George Plimpton's 1985 April Fools Day hoax, The Curious Case of Sidd Finch, Reynolds was mentioned as the catcher who painfully caught Sidd Finch's 168 mph fastball.
After the 1985 season, Reynolds was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Jeff Bittiger in exchange for Rodger Cole and Ronnie Gideon, neither of whom ever played a major league game.  He split the 1986 season between the Phillies and their class-AAA minor league affiliate in Portland.  He played 43 games for the Phillies, with a batting average of .214 (his Major League high), a slugging percentage of .242 and an on-base percentage of .317 in 126 at-bats.  He also hit 3 of his 4 lifetime Major League home runs that season.  He allowed 46 stolen bases in 59 attempts.
After the 1986 season, he was traded again to the Houston Astros for Jeff Calhoun.  He split the 1987 season between the Astros and their class-AAA minor league affiliate in Tucson.  He played 38 games for the Astros, with a batting average of .167, a slugging percentage of .189 and an on-base percentage of .235 in 102 at-bats.  He allowed 46 stolen bases in 59 attempts.  On October 1, Reynolds was the victim of a rare triple-steal versus the Atlanta Braves.  With the bases loaded, Reynolds made a return throw to pitcher Danny Darwin and the Braves' Gerald Perry broke from third towards home plate.  Darwin threw back to Reynolds but Reynolds dropped the ball and all three runners were safe.  Not only were the Braves credited with three stolen bases but Reynolds was injured on the play and left the game.
He was released by the Astros after the 1987 season and signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers.  He never played a game for the Brewers, spending the 1988 and 1989 seasons playing for the Brewers' class AAA affiliate in Denver.  His 1989 season was shortened by a pre-season Achilles tendon rupture.  He was granted free agency after the 1989 season and signed with the San Diego Padres.  He played most of the 1990 season with the Padres class-AAA affiliate in Las Vegas.  He did play 8 games for the Padres, getting just one hit (a double) in 15 at-bats.  He played his last major league game for the Padres on July 5, 1990.
In all, Reynolds played 143 Major League games in 6 seasons, getting 356 at-bats, 4 home runs, a career batting average of .188, a career slugging percentage of .228 and a career on-base percentage of .256.  His minor league totals were 701 games, 2193 at-bats, 49 home runs, a .238 batting average, a .358 slugging percentage and a .309 on-base percentage.

A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone, and a hand phone) is a phone that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link while moving around a wide geographic area.  It does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator, allowing access to the public telephone network.  By contrast, a cordless telephone is used only within the short range of a single, private base station.
In addition to telephony, modern mobile phones also support a wide variety of other services such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming and photography. Mobile phones that offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.
The first hand-held cell phone was demonstrated by John F. MitchellJohn F.

[[Leucoagaricus leucothites]]

CATEGORIES: Agaricaceae, Fungi of Europe, Fungi described in 1835

Leucoagaricus leucothites, or white Agaricus mushroom, is a fairly uncommon parasol mushroom. It looks more like a normal but almost pure white commercial mushroom albeit more slender and with a  longer stalk. It is distinguished by a smooth, white cap with a gently yellow center, a collar-like ring, white spores, and off-white gills in maturity.  Immature specimens have pure white gills. This is a choice edible, but care must be made to distinguish this from other members of the Lepiota tribe and also the far more deadly members of the Amanita tribe. The deadly white Amanitas have a volva (a sack like appendage surrounding the base of the stem) totally lacking in this species. This is not a mushroom recommended for consumption by those without good knowledge of fungi. This species is slowly extending its range northward, possibly as a result of global warming, and is locally common in Devon especially in Torbay (due to the exceptionally mild micro-climate), and other parts of south-west England. The species was originally described as Agaricus leucothites by Carlo Vittadini in 1835.

Cotyledon tomentosa, native to Africa, has large chunky ovate fuzzy green leaves with prominent "teeth" at tips that give the impression of bear's paws. It forms large orange bell-shaped flowers in spring. In habitat in Africa, Cotyledons usually grow in rocky quartz fields where they have excellent drainage provided by very porous soil. They thrive with bright light and ample airflow. Water thoroughly when soil is dry to the touch. Water with caution in winter, as the plant can lose its roots if the soil stays cold and wet for extended periods. They are dormant in summer. Protect from frost to prevent scarring.http://www.gardenlife.com/store/Crassulaceae-Cotyledon-tomentosa.html

August Kappler (November 11, 1815 -  October 20, 1887) was a German researcher, naturalist and explorer who was a native of Mannheim. He is credited as the founder of Albina, Suriname.
From January 1836, Kappler was  stationed in Suriname as a soldier and member of the Dutch colonial service. Here he had the opportunity to explore the country, and in the process, amass a large collection of insects and plants. In 1854 he published a book involving his experiences in the Dutch colony during time spent as a member of the colonial service. 
After his military duties were finished, he spent the years 1842 to 1846 based in Paramaribo, from where he sold butterflies that were collected locally. In latter part of 1846, he had earned enough money to purchase a plot of land near the Marowijne River. Here he would spent the next 33 years of his life, working as a trader, farmer, postal official, et al. He called his homestead "Albina", after his fiancé Albina Josefine Liezenmaier. Within the decade, Albina would become a small settlement with a handful of European settlers.
In 1879 Kappler left Suriname and returned to Germany, subsequently publishing two more books on his experiences in the Dutch colony. He died in Stuttgart at the age of 71, and at his funeral, his coffin was covered with the flag of the Netherlands.

CATEGORIES: 1987 direct-to-video films, Films based on toys, 1980s toys, Direct-to-video animated films

The Wild Puffalumps was a 22-minute direct-to-video animated cartoon, based on the Puffalump toy line of the same name. It was produced by Nelvana, and released on videocassette in the United States by Family Home Entertainment in 1987 and in Canada by Cineplex Odeon and MCA.
This cartoon was intended to act as an advertisement for the “Wild Puffalumps” toy line, which consisted of vividly-colored Puffalumps wearing Aloha shirts and sunglasses whose lenses displayed the word “WILD” when seen at the proper angle. The glasses were large enough that the children who owned the toys could wear them, a fact which was pointed out in the television commercial for the toys.
In the cartoon, the characters all live on an island separate from the rest of the world, much like many other 1980s toy-based cartoon characters (Care Bears, My Little Pony, etc.). The two children who visit this place soon find themselves going on a journey, parts of which are like amusement park rides, and the word “wild” is repeatedly emphasized throughout the cartoon. All of this is intended to make the characters fit in with the current cartoon culture, as well as give the impression that the toys on which they’re based are fun and exciting.
The VHS videocassette has been currently out of print since the end of the 1980s, and the cartoon was never released on DVD, and as of April 16, 2013, Lionsgate has not announced any plans to release it on DVD. The Wild Puffalumps toys were sold in 1987 and discontinued the same year.

[[Bulk electrolysis]]
CATEGORIES: Electroanalytical methods

Bulk electrolysis is also known as potentiostatic coulometry or controlled potential coulometry.  The experiment is a form of coulometry which generally employs a three electrode system controlled by a potentiostat.  In the experiment the working electrode is held at a constant potential (volts) and current (amps) is monitored over time (seconds).  In a properly run experiment an analyte is quantitatively converted from its original oxidation state to a new oxidation state, either reduced or oxidized.  As the substrate is consumed, the current also decreases, approaching zero when the conversion nears completion.  
The results of a bulk electrolysis are visually displayed as the total coulombs passed (total electric charge) plotted against time in seconds, even through the experiment measures electric current (amps) over time.  This is done to show that the experiment is approaching an expected total number of coulombs.

CATEGORIES: Museums in Canada, Lists of museums in Canada

Provincial museums of Canada are museums maintained by the provinces of Canada to preserve their local history and culture.  They are the equivalent to national museums operated by nation-states.
In the mostly French-speaking province of Quebec, the provincial government uses the term "national" to refer to provincial museums, reflecting the strength of Quebec nationalism.
Many provinces have separate facilities for history and natural history museums, art galleries, and archives.  In the case of Newfoundland and Labrador, all these functions are housed in one complex, The Rooms, in St. John's

Sir Thomas Gawdy SL (died 5 November 1588) was an English justice and Member of Parliament. 
He was the second of three sons of Thomas Gawdy, all by different wives and all baptised Thomas[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10469/?back=,10467&_fromAuth=1|title=Oxford DNB article:Gawdy, Sir Thomas|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] The mother of this Thomas was Anne Bennett. His elder half-brother was created a Serjeant-at-law in 1552 before dying in 1556, whilst his younger brother, Francis, served as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from August 1605 until December of that year. 
A member of the Inner Temple, Thomas was called to the bar in 1550, appointed a reader of his Inn in 1560 and treasurer in 1562. He was issued a writ to be called as a Serjeant-at-law in October 1558, but it lapsed on the death of Mary I. He was excluded from the list of Elizabeth I, possibly on his own request, but was renominated in 1567. In 1574 he was made a justice of the Court of King's Bench and in 1578 he was knighted.
As a lawyer Gawdy made much of his connections in East Anglia; at a young age he had come under the patronage of the Earl of Arundel, representing him in Parliament as the member for Arundel in 1553. However, the main focus of his activities was the city of Norwich, for which he sat in Parliament, as the member for Norwich, in 1557 and served as Recorder between 1558 and 1574. 
In 1548 he married Audrey Knightley, and her dowry and property was used to expand his own land. A year after she died in 1566 he married Frances Richers, and used the money from that marriage to buy more land and property, including Gawdy Hall, the family seat, and land at Redenhall and Harleston. He died at Gawdy Hall on 5 November 1588, and was buried at Redenhall Church.

Die Spinne, translated as The Spider, is believed by some to be a secret organization established and led in part by Otto Skorzeny, Hitler's commando chief, as well as Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen[tpl]cite news | title = Otto Skorzeny, Nazi Commando, Dead | publisher = The New York Times | date = July 8, 1975[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Nazis: The Deadly Spider | publisher = Newsweek | date = July 21, 1975[/tpl] which helped as many as 600 former SS men escape from Germany to Spain, Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, Bolivia and other countries. 
Die Spinne was established by Skorzeny using the cover names of Robert Steinbacher and Otto Steinbauer, and supported by either Nazi funds or, according to some sources, Austrian Intelligence. Later, Skorzeny, Gehlen and their network of collaborators had gained significant influence in parts of Europe and Latin America. Skorzeny travelled between Francoist Spain and Argentina, where he acted as an advisor to President Juan Perón and bodyguard of Eva Perón,"Peculiar liaisons: in war, espionage, and terrorism in the twentieth century", John S.

Irwinville is an unincorporated community in Irwin County, Georgia, United States.
Irwinville was founded as Irwinsville in 1831 as seat for the newly formed Irwin County. The community was named for Georgia governor Jared Irwin. It was renamed to Irwinville (without the S) when it was incorporated as a town in 1857. In 1907, the seat of Irwin County was transferred from Irwinville to Ocilla.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=REtEXQNWq6MC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA233#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Historical Gazetteer of the United States | publisher=Routledge | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | author=Hellmann, Paul T. | pages=233[/tpl]
It is best known as the site of Jefferson Davis's capture at the end of the Civil War. On May 9, 1865, Jefferson Davis and a small group of officials camped in this pine forest, not knowing that Union cavalry soldiers were in hot pursuit. At dawn they were surrounded by two independent groups of Union cavalry who were unaware of each other’s presence. Gunfire ensued until the federal forces realized they had been shooting at one another. Two Union cavalrymen died during the skirmish. Davis was then taken prisoner. The Jefferson Davis Memorial Historic Site is a Georgia State Park operated by Irwin County.
It was also a part of the Works Progress Administration projects in the thirties. A small water park originally called Crystal Lake (later changed to Crystal Beach) operated just outside of there from the middle of the twentieth century to 1998.

[[Charles Marlow]]

CATEGORIES: Joseph Conrad characters, Author surrogates, Fictional characters introduced in 1899, Characters in British novels of the 20th century

Charles Marlow is a recurring character in the work of Polish-born English novelist Joseph Conrad.  Marlow is an alter ego of Conrad; both are sailors for the British Empire during the late-19th and early-20th century during the height of British imperialism.
Marlow narrates several of Conrad's best-known works.  The character Marlow narrates Conrad's novels Lord Jim and Chance, as well as the framed narrative in "Heart of Darkness", and his short story "Youth".  The stories are not told entirely from Marlow's perspective however.  There is also an omniscient narrator who introduces Marlow and some of the other characters.  Then, once introduced, Marlow proceeds to tell the actual tale, creating a story-within-a-story effect.
In Heart of Darkness the omniscient narrator observes that "yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut.  But Marlow was not typical ... and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze."[tpl]Harvnb|Orr|Billy|1999|p=85[/tpl]

[[Wildcat formation]]
CATEGORIES: American football formations, American football strategy, American football terminology

Wildcat formation describes a formation for the offense in gridiron football in which the ball is snapped not to the quarterback but directly to a running back.  The Wildcat features an unbalanced offensive line and looks to the defense like a sweep behind zone blocking.  A player moves across the formation prior to the snap.  However, once this player crosses the position of the running back who will receive the snap, the play develops unlike the sweep.
Defending against the Wildcat is straightforward, but the defense does not always identify that a play will use the Wildcat, and preparing to defend against it may take practice time away from other preparation.  If a defense interprets the Wildcat as a regular sweep play to one side, it may reduce its defense of the weak side and make it easier for the running back to advance the ball by running to that side.
The Wildcat is a gambit rather than an overall offensive philosophy.  It can be a part of many offenses.  For example, a spread-option offense might use the Wildcat formation to keep the defense guessing, or a West Coast offense may use the power-I formation to threaten a powerful run attack.
The Wildcat scheme was invented by Billy Ford and Ryan Wilson, and was originally called the "Dual" formation.  It has been used since the late 1990s at every level of the game, including the CFL, NFL, NCAA, NAIA, and many high schools across North America.  Specific coaching staffs have used it with various innovations and have given their versions a variety of names.

[[Vanvas]]

CATEGORIES: Sanskrit words and phrases

Vanvas ([tpl]lang-sa|वनवास[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-hns|ʋənˈʋaːs[/tpl]) is a Sanskrit term meaning residence (vās) in a forest (van). While it can be undertaken voluntarily, it usually carries a connotation of forced exile as a punishment. It commonly figures as a harsh penalty in ancient Hindu epics (such as the Ramayan and Mahabharat) set in a time, thousands of years ago, when much of the Indian subcontinent was a wilderness.Gilbert Pollet, "Indian Epic Values: Ramayana and Its Impact: Proceedings of the 8th International Ramayana Conference, Leuven, 6-8 July 1991"; Peeters Publishers, 1995, ISBN 90-6831-701-6, ISBN 978-90-6831-701-5.
When vanvas is self-imposed, it can imply seclusion from worldly affairs to focus on spiritual matters, as in the case of ashrams (hermitages) established by ancient rishis. When imposed as a punishment, it carries an implication of enforced isolation from society and exposure to life-threatening situations (the elements and wildlife).

[[Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access]]
CATEGORIES: Maritime communication

Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) is a channel access method which was designed by Håkan Lans, based on time-division multiplexing.
The term "Self-Organized" describes the manner in which time slots are assigned to users. Time division multiple access (TDMA) divides a channel into frames, which furthermore are subdivided into a vast number of time slots. Users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using his own time slot. One of the drawbacks of TDMA is that it requires a central station for slot assignment and time synchronisation. STDMA proposes a method for assigning slots without the involvement of a central station. Time synchronisation is usually taken care of using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
STDMA is in use by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), a standard marine short range coastal tracking system, and is the base of the International Civil Aviation Organization VHF Data Link Mode 4 .
While the method was patented, a US patent ex-parte reexamination certificate was issued in 2010 canceling all claims.USPTO ex-parte reexamination certificate (7428th), issued on March 30, 2010

[[Natolin faction]]
CATEGORIES: 1956 in Poland, Political history of Poland, History of Poland (1945–1989)

Natolin faction - a faction within the leadership of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (Polish: PZPR). Formed around 1956, shortly after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it was named after the place where its meetings took place, in a government villa in Natolin. The main opposition to the Natolines was the so-called Pulawian faction.
Natolinians were against the post-Stalinist liberalization programs (the "thaw") and they proclaimed simple nationalist and antisemitic slogans as part of a strategy to gain power. The most well known members included Franciszek Jóźwiak, Wiktor Kłosiewicz, Zenon Nowak, Aleksander Zawadzki, Władysław Dworakowski, Hilary Chełchowski. After the 8th Plenum of Central Committee of PZPR in October 1956 the faction suffered a major setback as the First Secretary of the Party, Wladysław Gomulka, chose to back (and in return, be supported by) the Pulawians. Both the Natoline and the Pulawian factions disappeared towards the end of the 1950's.

CATEGORIES: 1451 births, 1501 deaths, Grand Princes of Ryazan, Women of medieval Russia, 15th-century female rulers, 15th-century rulers in Europe

Grand Princess Anna Vasilievna of Ryazan ([tpl]lang-ru|Анна Васильевна[/tpl]) (1451–1501) was a Russian noblewoman, the only daughter of Grand Prince Vasily II of Moscow and the mother and grandmother of last Grand Princes of Ryazan Principality. Anna was born in Moscow to the family of Vasily II of Moscow, who was blinded five years before her birth during a time of troubles, and his wife Maria Yaroslavna of Borovsk.
Before his death in 1456 Grand Prince Ivan Fyodorovich of Ryazan entrusted his friend Vasily of Moscow with temporary governing of the principality and taking care of his children Vasily and Theodosia until their maturity. But soon after Ivan's death Vasily of Moscow moved orphans to Moscow and appointed a voevoda to Ryazan. This decision started a process of joining of Ryazan Principality to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Vasily II's heir Ivan III of Russia continued his father's policy towards Ryazan and Anna grew together with Ryazan prince Vasily.
When Anna grew up her mother has decided to marry Anna and Vasily. She asked her son Ivan III to delay annexation of Ryazan because it was not suitable to a Grand Princess to marry an ordinary nobleman even of princely descent. Ivan III agreed and allowed on Summer 1464 to return sixteen-year Prince Vasily to his family seat. But the same winter he came to Moscow to marry Anna and, after the wedding, the couple returned to Ryazan.
In 1467 Anna bore a son Ivan and until the death of her husband in 1483 did not participate in governing the principality and did not protest when her brother two times annexed Ryazan territories. In 1483 Anna became the regent of her sixteen-year son.
In her policy Anna tried to expand her domain, she visited often Moscow and due her diplomatic efforts the Pronsk principality was added to Ryazan. A major problem in Ryazan-Moscow relations was so-called ryazan ukraina, a huge steppe region in the basin of Don River. According to treaties, Ryazan was obliged not to settle in these lands, but many years Ryazan princes secretly colonized this area and during the Anna's regency this process become much more significant. Numerous immigrants received considerable privileges, being released for 3–7 years from taxes if agreed to remain in steppe for ever.
Anna's son died in 1500 and until her death in 1501 she was the regent of her grandson Ivan V of Ryazan. After the end of Anna's reign Ryazan Principality finally lost its independence. Except of Ivan, Anna had son Fyodor and daughter Anna who was married to Lithuanian Prince Feodor Ivanovich Belski.

Hjalte Rasmussen (December 18, 1940 - August 9, 2012) was Professor of European Union Law at the University of Copenhagen.  Previously he was a Professor of law at the Law Department of the Copenhagen Business School and a Visiting Professor at the College of Europe, at Bruges.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/danmark/professor-hjalte-rasmussen-er-doed |title=Professor Hjalte Rasmussen er død - Danmark |publisher=www.bt.dk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl]
For his 70th birthday a liber amicorum was published under the title "Europe. The New Legal Realism - Essays in Honour of Hjalte Rasmussen", (2010) edited by Henning Koch, Karsten Hagel-Sørensen, Ulrich Haltern and Joseph H.H. Weiler. 
His doctoral thesis "On Law and Policy in the European Court of Justice. A Comparative Study in Judicial Policymaking" 1986, Nijhoff, Dordrecht  was a ground-breaking critique of the European Court of Justice as policy-maker and was fiercely controversial.  It was the first academically respectable book to question the Court's embrace of judicial activism in seeking to further European integration. 
The eminent British scholar Professor Paul Beaumont states: "The academic community of scholars interested in European Law owes a debt to Hjalte Rasmussen for his willingness to break out of the general mould of eulogising the Court of Justice in his controversial book in 1986. Judges are not democratically accountable and therefore their actions must be held to account by the small group of people who have the time and the training to follow their work closely. Criticism of the Court should be accepted as normal, especially by members of the Court. If the Court is acting properly its judgments and its apologists will have answers for their critics. Rasmussen may have had little to do with the Court's greater self-restraint in the 1990s but it is a welcome development. He is absolutely right to insist that the future direction of the European Union should be determined by its peoples in intergovernmental conferences and in the legislative process not by judicial rewriting of the words of the EC Treaty to conform to the Court's view of the meaning of the vague and inconclusive objectives of the Union set out at the beginning of the EC Treaty."

[[MG M-type]]

CATEGORIES: MG vehicles, 1930s automobiles, 24 Hours of Le Mans race cars

The MG M-type was produced by the MG Car company from April 1929 to 1932. It was sometimes referred to as the 8/33. Launched at the 1928 London Motor Show when the sales of the larger MG saloons was faltering because of the economic climate, the small car brought MG ownership to a new sector of the market and probably saved the company. Early cars were made in the Cowley factory, but from 1930 production had transferred to Abingdon.
This 2-door sports car used an updated version of the four-cylinder bevel-gear driven overhead camshaft engine used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor giving [tpl]convert|20|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] at 4000 rpm.  Drive was to the rear wheels through a three-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was based on the one used in the 1928 Morris Minor with lowered suspension using half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and bolt on wire wheels. The car had a wheelbase of 78 inches (1980 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm).
1930 brought a series of improvements to the car. The Morris rod brake system, with the handbrake working on the transmission, was replaced a cable system with cross shaft coupled to the handbrake and the transmission brake deleted. Engine output was increased to [tpl]convert|27|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] by improving the camshaft and a four-speed gearbox was offered as an option.  The doors became front-hinged. A supercharged version could be ordered from 1932, raising the top speed to [tpl]convert|80|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
Early bodies were fabric-covered using a wood frame; this changed to all-metal in 1931. Most cars had bodies made by Carbodies of Coventry and fitted by MG in either open two-seat or closed two-door "Sportsmans" coupé versions, but some chassis were supplied to external coachbuilders such as Jarvis.  The factory even made a van version as a service vehicle. The car could reach 65 mph (105 km/h) and return 40 miles per gallon. The open version cost £175 at launch, soon rising to £185, and the coupé cost £245. The 1932 supercharged car cost £250.
The M-type had considerable sporting success, both privately and with official teams winning gold medals in the 1929 Land's End Trial and class wins in the 1930 "Double Twelve" race at Brooklands. An entry was also made in the 1930 Le Mans 24 hour, but neither of the two cars finished.

[[Col di Lana]]

The Col di Lana is a mountain of the Fanes Group in the Italian Dolomites, situated in Livinallongo del Col di Lana (German: Buchenstein), a municipality of the Province of Belluno, in the Italian region of Veneto.
During World War I the mountain, alongside the neighbouring Monte Sief, was the scene of heavy fighting between Austria and Italy.  It is now a memorial to the War in the Dolomites.
During the years of 1915/16, Italian troops from 12 infantry and 14 Alpini companies repeatedly attempted to storm the peak, defended first by the German Alpenkorps and later by Austrian regiments.  These attempts resulted in heavy losses; 278 Italians died due to avalanches alone.  On the 8th of November 1915 the Italians, under the command of  Lt. Col. Giuseppe Garibaldi II conquered the summit but then could only mount a weak defence with rag-tag units against a well orchestrated pincer manoeuvre: the top of the Col di Lana fell back to Austrian troops early the next day. A terrible winter then settle in, doing its fair share of killing. However this is not the only reason that the Italians dubbed it "Col di Sangue", "Blood Mountain".  Like all sides in the First World War, the Italian Army sought to conquer the summit with relatively large forces, paying a high price in casualties.
Lieutenant Caetani of the Italian engineers developed a plan for mining the peak, which was executed silently using hand-operating drilling machines and chisels. The Italians had used a similar method to attack Austrians holding one of Mount Tofano's summits, but while most of the Austrian garrison survived the resulting blast, many Italians were killed by falling boulders and afterdamp. At the start of 1916, the Austrians learned through an artillery observer on Pordoi Pass that the summit had been mined.  The Austrians began a counter mine, and exploded this on 5 April 1916.  The counter mine was, however, too far away from the Italian explosive tunnel.  This was laid with five tonnes of blasting gelatin.  On the night of 16/17 April 1916, the 5th Company of the 2nd Tyrolean Kaiserjäger regiment was relieved by the 6th Company, under Oberleutnant Anton von Tschurtschenthaler.  The struggle reached its zenith on the night of 17/18 April 1916, when at around 23:30 the summit was blasted.  The Austrians under Tschurtschenthaler then had to surrender the mountain; however they were able to maintain a position on Monte Sief, which is linked to Col di Lana by a ridge, which was cut in two by a following Austrian mine, thereby obstructing the Italian breakthrough in the area. 
Today a chapel stands on the summit as a memorial to the soldiers that fell in battle. The remains of a barracks and decaying gun and communications trenches have been left behind from the war. There is also a small war museum on the mountain.
The route is from Pieve di Livinallongo (1,465 m) via the Rifugio Pian della Lasta (1,835 m); there is a road as far as the hut.

Sir James Starritt KCVO (15 May 1914 – 2000), often known as Jim Starritt, was a British police officer in the London Metropolitan Police.
Starritt was born in Carrigans, a tiny village in the Laggan district of eastern County Donegal, Ireland, the son of a land auctioneer. His family - staunch Ulster Presbyterians - later moved east to the small town of Magherafelt in County Londonderry following the Partition of Ireland. He was educated at the local Rainey School.
He joined the Metropolitan Police as a Constable in 1935 and was first posted to Paddington. In the Second World War he joined the Royal Marines and was later commissioned and served in the Far East, being promoted to Temporary Lieutenant in April 1945[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=37071 |date=8 May 1945 |startpage=2421 |supp=yes[/tpl] and Acting Temporary Captain in November 1945.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=37480 |date=22 February 1946 |startpage=1089 |supp=yes[/tpl] After the war he returned to the Metropolitan Police, and was promoted Sergeant in 1947, Inspector in 1952, and Chief Inspector in 1955. He spent almost all of his career in Central London and was a particular expert on the criminal gangs of Soho.
He was Chief Superintendent commanding "C" Division at West End Central in the early 1960s and featured prominently in the 1964 public inquiry into one of his men, Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor, who continued to work despite having paranoid schizophrenia. Starritt was exonerated of all blame in the case, as Challenor had never been certified as medically unfit for duty. He was promoted Deputy Commander in 1965 and Commander in 1967, working in the force inspectorate.
In 1968, Starritt was appointed Assistant Commissioner "B" (Traffic)"Assistant police commissioner", The Times, 25 April 1968[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=44589 |date=17 May 1968 |startpage=5621 |supp=[/tpl] and later (probably in early 1970) moved to become Assistant Commissioner "A" (Operations and Administration).

In 1975, he headed the inquiry into police corruption in Soho which led to the arrests of twelve officers, including two commanders and a chief superintendent. In his autobiography, In the Office of Constable, Commissioner Sir Robert Mark wrote that Starritt deserved an "honoured place in Metropolitan Police history for putting an end to malpractice that had caused the force incalculable harm for many years".
He was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1973 New Year Honours[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=45860 |date=29 December 1972 |startpage=4 |supp=yes[/tpl] and Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 1975 Birthday Honours,[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=46593 |date=6 June 1975 |startpage=7372 |supp=yes[/tpl] shortly before his retirement.

Fuzzy locating is a rough but reliable method based on appropriate measuring technology for estimating a location of an object. The concept of precise or crisp locating is replaced with respect to the operational requirements and the economic viability. In most cases the knowledge of exact coordinates does not contribute to operations, but the spatial or planar relation between entities is relevant. Hence fuzzy locating determines the radial distances between entities involved in an operational process and reduces the required accuracy of measurement to basic qualities of close, near or far and to relations simple as in or out. However such segregation shall be achieved with high reliability and sound repetition.

Between 1995 and 2002 Plastic City was also located in London (Plastic City UK) and New York (Plastic city America) with several individual single releases and its own repertoire (tribe) of artists. In consequences of the September 11th, 2001 and the fact, that the New Yorker bureau was located in the neighbourhood of Ground Zero, label activities had been stopped. Also „Plastic City UK“ didn’t release any new albums for a short-term period. A lot of artists of this time from both sister labels are now releasing directly on the mother label in Germany.
The musical responsibility has firstly Alexander Hendorf (A&R). Afterwards appeared Babak Shayan (2001-2002). Since 2004 Joachim Keil assumes full responsibility for Plastic City, whereas since 2006 Alex Flatner is responsible for artists management. 
The most successful releases of Plastic City are Compilation series of Terry’s Café (1-12), Deep Train (1-6) as well as the albums of Terry Lee Brown Junior and The Timewriter. Since August 2008 there is a weekly radio show at the Sonica Radio station Ibiza with Gorge.

[[Transitional armour]]

CATEGORIES: Medieval armour, Western plate armour

Transitional armour describes the armour used in Europe around the 14th century, as body armour moved from simple maille hauberks to full plate. 
The couter was added to the hauberk to better protect the elbows, and splinted armour and the coat of plates provided increased protection for other areas. 
Armourers in general began experimenting with various forms of rigid defense. They worked in a variety of materials, including wrought iron, latten, leather, cloth and even bone to substitute rigid materials for maille as the knight's harness progressed. Toward the end of the century and into the following one, updates to armour took place at an accelerated rate. 
The use of multiple materials is the key stylistic element of the period. For instance, a set of transitional style arm defenses could employ steel pauldrons, leather rerebraces, steel elbow cops and leather vambraces. These items would be strapped with leather and might have brass or bronze fittings and buckles. This use of varied materials gave the armour different coloring, textures and more elegant appearance.
Swordfighting re-enactors such as the Society for Creative Anachronisms wear personalized transitional armour for safety reasons, composed of a combination of thick leather, mail and plate armour.

Hershey, PA: Information Science Publishing It emphasizes shared expertise and collaborative work for knowledge building and inquiry by setting up the context, using questions, explanations, theories, and scientific information in the cycle of deepening inquiry. It is often used with computer-supported collaborative learning. The model has evolved from the initial cognitively oriented one toward versions that highlight pragmatic and socio-cultural aspects of inquiry.
The model describes the elements of expert-like knowledge practices in a form of a cyclic inquiry process.Hakkarainen, K. (1998).

In a progressive inquiry process, the teacher creates a context for inquiry by presenting a multidisciplinary approach to a theoretical or real-life phenomenon, after which the students start defining their own questions and intuitive working theories about it. Students’ questions and explanations are shared and evaluated together, which directs the utilization of authoritative information sources and iterative elaboration of subordinate study questions and more advanced theories, explanations and writings (see the description of the phases of progressive inquiry process). The model is not meant prescriptively, as an ideal path to be followed rigidly; rather it offers conceptual tools to describe, understand and take into account the critical elements in collaborative knowledge-advancing inquiry.

[[Nysted reagent]]

CATEGORIES: Zinc compounds, Reagents for organic chemistry, Organometallic compounds

The Nysted reagent is a reagent used in organic synthesis for the methenylation of a carbonyl group.  It was discovered in 1975 by Leonard N. Nysted in Chicago, Illinois. It was prepared by reacting dibromomethane and activated zinc in THF.Nysted, L.N. US Patent, 1975, 3 865 848.  see Chem. Abstr., 1875, 83, 10406q.  The process is known as Nysted olefination. There is no confirmed mechanism but a proposed mechanism can be seen to bottom right.
A similar reagent is Tebbe's reagent."Nysted Reagent." Comprehensive Organic Name Reactions and Reagents. 2010; John Wiley and Sons, Inc.  In the Nysted olefination, the Nysted reagent reacts with TiCl4 to methylenate a carbonyl group.  The biggest problem with these reagents are that the reactivity has not been well documented.  It is believed that the TiCl4 acts as a mediator in the reaction.  Nysted reagent can methylenate different carbonyl groups in the presence of different mediators.  For example, in the presence of BF3•OEt2, the reagent will methylenate aldehydes.  On the other hand, in the presence of TiCl4, TiCl3 or TiCl2 and BF3•OEt2, the reagent can methylenate ketones.  Most commonly, it is used to methylenate ketones because of their general difficulty to methylenate due to crowding around the carbonyl group.  Nysted is able to get into the tight space and methylenate the carbonyl group easily. 

There is little research on Nysted reagent because of the hazards and high reactivity and the difficulty of keeping the reagent stable while it is in use.  More specifically, it can form explosive peroxides when exposed to air and is extremely flammable.  Also, it reacts violently with water.  These make this reagent very dangerous to work with.Nysted Reagent. MSDS No.381985; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, April 3, 2009.

[[Piscatorial Society]]

CATEGORIES: Recreational fishing

The Piscatorial Society is one of the oldest angling societies in England, if not the world. It was founded in 1836 and still flourishes today. It leases fly fishing water on a number of chalk streams in Hampshire and Wiltshire, including the Wylye, the Test, the Itchen and the Hampshire Avon. It no longer has a base in London, but maintains a Rod Room on one of its Wiltshire rivers. Although members originally fished for all sorts of fish (the society's crest still represents the head of a pike), the society now concentrates on fishing for brown trout and grayling with upstream dry fly or unweighted nymph imitations dressed lightly in the style of G.E.M. Skues.
The Society has, at its core, three key objectives. First, to maintain a fellowship of flyfishers and the tradition of flyfishing, where possible, for wild or naturalised brown trout and grayling. Secondly, to preserve what remains of the chalk stream environment; unpolluted water, healthy and appropriate weed growth and good fly hatches. Thirdly, to enhance the Society’s libraries and archives.

He is a senior research fellow within the department of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton where he specialises in the politics, philosophy and epistemology of technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/about/kieron_o_hara.php |title=ECS - Researcher Profiles - Dr Kieron O’Hara |publisher=Ecs.soton.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/kmo |title=Dr Kieron O'Hara |publisher=Ecs.soton.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] He is also a research fellow at the Web Science Trust[tpl]cite doi|10.1561/1800000001[/tpl]Kieron O'Hara Web Science Trust website[tpl]cite doi|10.1109/MIS.2004.1265889[/tpl] and  the conservative think-tank, the Centre for Policy Studies.Kieron O'Hara, Centre for Policy Studies website 
In Conservatism (2011), O’Hara developed the philosophy of ‘small-c conservatism’ that he originally outlined in After Blair (2005/7). He argued that conservatism must be a philosophy concerned with social change, and must be defensible using public reason. To that end, he defined conservatism as the knowledge principle plus the change principle. The knowledge principle, influenced by scepticism, states that:
“because society and its mediating institutions are highly complex and dynamic with natures that are constantly evolving as they are co-constituted with the individuals who are their members, both data and theories about society are highly uncertain”.Kieron O’Hara, Conservatism, pp.49-50.
The change principle adds:
“because the current state of society is typically undervalued, and because the effects of social innovations cannot be known fully in advance, then social change (a) must always risk destroying beneficial institutions and norms and (b) cannot be guaranteed to achieve the aims for which it was implemented. It therefore follows that societies should be risk-averse with respect to social change, and the burden of proof placed on the innovator, not his or her opponents. It also follows that change, when it does come, should ideally be (a) incremental, (b) reversible where possible and (c) rigorously evaluated before the next incremental step”.Conservatism, p.88.

RETORNEMOS AO PASTOR QUE APASCENTA A VIDA. http://derv.wordpress.com/page/3/
He finds on the post-modern thinking and its concepts of performativity, utility, and lucrativity, and the Bauhaus model of bricolage a new scientific paradigm. The post-modern paradigm broke with the modern paradigm of rationality.WESTPHAL, Euler R. O Oitavo Dia: Na era da seleção natural, pages 5ff.
The post-modernism look at the nature as a good thing when it is useful to the humankind, because science and human power are coincident. In the post-modern religion the eschatological and messianic hope is no more in Jesus Christ, but in the efforts to find out a possibility to immortality, good wealth and eternal life through genetical improvement. The wishes of the post-modern man are to reach the perfect human being, the great wealth, without illness and death, the brave new world.Id. Ibid, pages 20ff.
When science becomes religion and the scientists become priests the humankind starts a new age of totalitarianism of science. The reality of the Almighty God, Creator and Redeemer, is no more recognized by post-modern man, who now adopt the performativity and lucrativity as a new dogma of scientific religion. Predestination is no more a Christian dogma but a concept of biotechnology. The scientist can see, as a small-great-god, who is predestined by the genetic code to develop an illness, like a cancer. Therefore the scientist became the one who can chose life or death for a new life under formation.Id. Ibid, pages 40ff.
88
There are many risks on see the science as a religion. Or to put the science as criteria of truth, specially this kind of science that has on post-modern thinking its epistemological base. The practice of get patents of living being its one of these kinds of risks. When an economical group has the patent of a soy bean, than the farmers cannot produce soy without pay royalties to the company that has the patent rights. So poor people at south countries will have their free access to seeds for planting not allowed, in consequence they will not have food for their countries.Id. Ibid, pages 60ff.
The bioethics is multidisciplinary subject, it dialogues with different ethical issues like philosophical ethics, medical ethics, theological ethics and so one. Theology can give its contribution on situations like abort, euthanasia, research with living beings. The Christian faith can recover the respect with life and its mystery.Id. Ibid, pages 80ff.
In the Eighth Day the human being has created the brave new world. The little-man-god redesigned the life beings and the human being as image and likeness of the Market-God's utilitarists interests. We need to give the appropriate place to the creation and to the human beings as creation of the Triune God. All things are maintained by the presence of His Holy Spirit. Humility of the science will guarantee that science still be science and not became a religion that promise eternal life, immortality and salvation.Id. Ibid, pages 110ff.

David A. Hodell (born 1958) is a geologist and paleoclimatologist. He currently holds the position of Woodwardian Professor of Geology in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge, where he is also a fellow of Clare College.  Previously, he taught at the University of Florida from 1986–2008, earning the rank of full professor in geological sciences. Hodell was also the director of the Stable Isotope Laboratory from 1996–2008.Stable Isotope Laboratory at the University of Florida. Hodell earned his Ph.D. in 1986 in oceanography from the University of Rhode Island after earning his bachelor of arts in 1980 in geology from the University of Vermont. 
Research by Hodell, Brenner, Curtis and Guilderson was instrumental in rethinking the Maya Collapse.  Climate data derived from core samples retrieved from closed lake systems in the Mexico's Yucátan and Guatemala showed a period of extensive drought.  In 1995, Hodell, Curtis and Brenner published a paleoclimate record from Lake Chichancanab on the Yucatán Peninsula that showed an intense, protracted drought occurred in the 9th century AD and coincided with the Classic Maya collapse. Hodell, Curtis and Brenner returned to Lake Chichancanab in May 2000 and collected new cores while being filmed for a BBC production on drought and Maya prehistory, as part of the BBC series "Ancient Apocalypse".    These new cores showed that the devastating drought of the ninth century AD was only one in a series of drought episodes on the Yucatán Peninsula during the last 2,600 years. This research team points out that these dry events occur about every 208 years and coincide with episodes of greater solar intensity that have been shown previously to have a periodicity of 206 years.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hodell |first=David A. |authorlink= |coauthors=Curtis, Jason H.; Brenner, Mark |year=1995 |title=Possible role of climate in the collapse of Classic Maya civilization |journal=Nature |volume=375 |issue=6530 |pages=391–394 |doi=10.1038/375391a0 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl] This suggests that the roughly bicentennial droughts that occur in the Maya lowlands are controlled partly by changes in solar intensity.

CATEGORIES: United States federal environmental legislation, Forestry in the United States, Forest law

The Multiple Use - Sustained Yield Act of 1960 (or MUSYA) (Public Law 86-517) is a federal law passed by the United States Congress on June 12, 1960. This law authorizes and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and administer the renewable resources of timber, range, water, recreation and wildlife on the national forests for multiple use and sustained yield of the products and services.
This is the first law to have the five major uses of national forests contained in one law equally, with no use greater than any other.Godfrey, Anthony The Ever-Changing View-A History of the National Forests in California USDA Forest Service Publishers, 2005 p. 399
By the 1950s, the national forests no longer held enough resources to meet the  growing needs of an increasing population and expanding economy. The U.S. Forest Service had operated within broad authorities since Gifford Pinchot's time as Chief Forester. Now, for the first time the agency had a specific congressional directive which stipulated that economic return was not in all cases to be the limiting factor.Steen, Harold K. The United States Forest Service, A History University of Washington Press 1976 pp. 199-200
MUSYA defines the terms "multiple use" and "sustained yield" as follows:
In 1996, this law was amended by P.L. 104-333.

From mid-2007 Vrangsinn was joined by Harry Stapleton. And so Misantrof was born. The philosophy behind Misantrof ANTIRecords is that all their artists' music is available for free download. Fans are encouraged to share the music among their friends. In the future Misantrof will release some of these albums in vinyl format with thought being put into artwork and other nice extras in order to make the album special. The long term intent of misantrof is a place where all art forms come together, and create a massive display, each piece enhancing the other. A place where creative people are free to express themselves is any art form free from any notion of commercialisation.
Misantrof is currently run by a board consisting of musicians and music fans. Other musicians which have joined Vrangsinn on the board are Pål Robert Sæther(chairman), Øystein Ariansen(artist relations).
Misantrof is unusual in that all artists keep the rights to their music. Misantrof is intended as a way to show the music industry how a label should operate and to show that artists can receive a much fairer percentage of the profits. Misantrof releases music without any commercial consideration and in its artists looks for quality music but more importantly originality.

The Cannon Building in Troy, New York is located on Broadway between First and State streets. It is the oldest building  on Monument Square.[tpl]cite web|last=Peckham|first=Mark|title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, Central Troy Historic District (requires JavaScript)|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7683|publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|date=July 1986|accessdate=2008-10-26[/tpl].

It was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis and built in 1835. In 1970 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also a contributing property to the Central Troy Historic District, listed on the Register in 1986.
Davis, who collaborated with Ithiel Town on the building, used the then-popular Greek Revival style to produce one of the rare surviving large-scale commercial buildings in that style. After two fires in the years after the Civil War, a mansard roof, usually associated with that era's Second Empire style, was added to the top of the building to create an unusual combination. It continues to be used as a retail-office building, although a developer is redoing the upper floors as an extended-stay hotel.

The 1985 Paris–Roubaix took place on 14 April in rainy conditions.
At one point, former three times winner Francesco Moser looked the serious contender, but a crash due to a hole between cobbles and a slow repair of his equipment eliminated Moser from the final. 
About 15 kilometres from Roubaix, Marc Madiot escaped from an eight-man group with among others defending race winner Sean Kelly. Madiot held on and entered the velodrome in Roubaix on his own to win. Bruno Wojtinek, leaving the chase group some two kilometres from the line, finished second, cementing a French double. Sean Kelly and Greg Lemond were the next riders home having avoided a crash just as the chasing group was entering the velodrome in Roubaix.

When the nearby town of Sheffield was facing commercial decline, Inder was instrumental in establishing Sheffield as a town of murals with a mural fest. Other festivals he played a leading role in establishing include the Blooming Tasmania festival and the Lavender festival.

CATEGORIES: Parasitic flies, Parasites of birds, Diptera of Europe, Diptera of Asia, Hippoboscidae

Crataerina pallida, the swift lousefly, is a species of biting fly in the family of louse flies Hippoboscidae. These flies are commonly encountered in the nests of the Common Swift (Apus apus) in Europe and Asia.[tpl]cite book|author=Hutson, A.M|year=1984|title=Diptera: Keds, flat-flies & bat-flies (Hippoboscidae & Nycteribiidae)|pages=84 pp|publisher= Royal Entomological Society of London | series = Handbooks for the Identification of British Insects|issn=| volume = 10 pt 7 [/tpl] 
The lousefly spends its entire life cycle associated with swifts. The adult lousefly produce larvae in the late summer months which then pupate and lie dormant during the winter months inside the vacated swift nest. These parasites have highly aggregated population distribution and high levels of host prevalence. The adult fly then hatch out in spring when the first swift eggs are laid, by the returning adults, and feed on the blood of the nestlings and the adults, sucking about 25 mg of blood every 5 days. They can be a serious pest of adult and nestling swifts.
Crataerina pallida is vertically transmitted ectoparasite, in that it is passed from parent host on to offspring. C. pallida are relatively benign, because their own species fitness will depend on successful reproduction of swifts. Evidence suggests that C. pallida had little if any effect on nestling growth or fledging success rate.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Tompkins D. M.; Jones T.; Clayton D.

The Church of San Bernardo ([tpl]lang-es|link=no|Iglesia de San Bernardo[/tpl]) stands at the corner of Avenida 20 de Noviembre and Venustiano Carranza Street just south of the Zocalo or main plaza of Mexico City. It was part of a convent of the same name that was founded in 1636, but was closed along with all convents and monasteries during the La Reforma period in 1861. Currently, only the church remains of the convent complex. [tpl]cite book |last=Horz de Via |first=Elena |title=Guia Oficial Centro de la Ciudad de Mexico |year=1991 |publisher=INAH-SALVAT |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=968-32-0540-2 |pages=35–36 [/tpl] 
The church was part of a convent of the same name which was sponsored by Juan Marquez de Orozco, a merchant who left his fortune to the Church with the stipulation that the money be used to found a convent for the Cistercian Order.  After Orozo’s death, José Retes de Largacha, Marquis of San Jorge, became the convent’s benefactor, purchasing the land for the church and convent. . [tpl]cite book |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |coauthors= Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location= Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=206 [/tpl]  The convent was founded in 1636, by three of Orozco’s sisters and two other nuns, all from the Convent of Regina Coeli. . The church was consecrated in  1690. In the 18th century, Miguel de Berrio y Saldivar, Count of San Mateo Valparaiso, took charge of repair work, leading to the use of geometrically-cut tezontle stone. The church was rededicated in 1777 .
During the Reform period under Benito Juárez, all monasteries and convents were closed and this convent was demolished, except for the church. Its demolition paved the way of the opening of the street that would become 20 de Noviembre.
Much of the façade’s surface is covered in tezontle a reddish, porous volcanic rock. The decoration of the main façade of the church is what is called a “discreet” expression of the Baroque style, meaning not all of the surface is covered in decoration, but the sections which do have them are done in that style. The work done on this church has been compared to the filigree done by silversmiths. Where the Baroque style really stands out is the profusion of decoration surrounding the niches; one of which holds an image of Saint Bernard and the other a figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This figure used to be on the opposite side of the church/convent, but when it was dismantled, it was moved here. The main architect of the church was Juan Zepeda .
On the exterior is a bronze plaque that reads “Las Religiosas Concepcionistas del Convento del Dulcísimo Nombre de María del Glorioso San Bernardo. Fundado el 30 III 1636 in este Lugar, Celebramos 350 años de su fundación, 1986”
The Church's interior has a neo-classic altar.

[[Time-dependent gate oxide breakdown]]
CATEGORIES: Semiconductor device defects

Time-dependent gate oxide breakdown (or time-dependent dielectric breakdown, TDDB) is a failure mechanism in MOSFETs, when the gate oxide breaks down as a result of long-time application of relatively low electric field (as opposite to immediate breakdown, which is caused by strong electric field). The breakdown is caused by formation of a conducting path through the gate oxide to substrate due to electron tunneling current, when MOSFETs are operated close to or beyond their specified operating voltages.

[[Partial agreement]]
CATEGORIES: International organizations, International law, Council of Europe

Partial agreement is a term used within the Council of Europe to refer to a major activity of European cooperation that is organised by the Council of Europe but does not include all of its member states. This form of activity dates from a resolution adopted by the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers on 2 August 1951.[tpl]Fact|date=November 2008[/tpl] The resolution allowed for the adoption of agreements by a limited number of member states, without the participation of the remainder. Any expenditure would be made by the participating states alone. This form of variable geometry in intergovernmental cooperation has not been imitated by other international organisations. This form of cooperation also allows some activities to include non-European states as full-fledged participants.
In 1993 the ground-rules were revised by the Committee of Ministers to take into account new developments. Statutory Resolution (93) 28 of the Committee of Ministers replaced the 1951 resolution.[tpl]Fact|date=November 2008[/tpl] It defines three types of agreement:
- A partial agreement: some member States of the Council of Europe;
- An enlarged partial agreement: some member States with one or more non-member states;
- An enlarged agreement: all member States with one or more non-member states. 
The Council of Europe currently lists its agreements[tpl]Clarifyme|date=February 2009[/tpl] as the following:
- The Council of Europe Development Bank (1956)
- Partial Agreement in the Social and Public Health Field (1959)
- The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (1964)
- The Pompidou Group - Cooperation Group to Combat Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Drugs (1980) 
- EUR-OPA - The European and Mediterranean Major Hazards Agreement (1987)
- The North-South Centre (1989)
- Eurimages - The European Support Fund for the co-production and distribution of films (1988)
- The Venice Commission) - The European Commission for Democracy through Law (1990)
- The Youth Card (1991)
- The European Audiovisual Observatory (1992)
- The Centre for Modern Languages in Graz
- GRECO - The Group of States Against Corruption (1998)
- The Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport (2007)
Partial agreements are traditionally set up with a resolution of the Committee of Ministers. The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, which is usually listed as a Partial Agreement, falls outside of this definition, being the result of a treaty, and is thus technically a treaty body, such as the European Social Charter organs. 
There is one agreement, the European Card for Substantially Handicapped Persons, dating from 1977, which was still-born, having never attracted sufficient interest from member states and so was never implemented.
Each agreement has its own form of supervision and management. A number of the agreements are supervised by the Committee of Ministers, others have their own executive boards.
In 2007, the activities of the  public health partial agreement were transferred to the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, despite the fact that the member states were not the same.[tpl]Fact|date=November 2008[/tpl]
The latest agreement, on sport, heralds a new development, deals with an activity that had always been a mainstream intergovernmental activity but was relegated to a partial agreement to avoid it being axed altogether.[tpl]Fact|date=November 2008[/tpl]
The Venice Commission is unique as being the one agreement which began life as a partial agreement and, being of its success, had to drop the qualifier 'Partial', when the last remaining member state decided to join up.
The Council of Europe treaty office issues regularly updated information on all partial and enlarged agreements, listing all member states, observers, dates of accession and reference texts.Council of Europe treaty office web site

[[Matching theory (economics)]]
CATEGORIES: Macroeconomics, Labor economics

In economics, matching theory, also known as search and matching theory, is a mathematical framework attempting to describe the formation of mutually beneficial relationships over time.
Matching theory has been especially influential in labor economics, where it has been used to describe the formation of new jobs, as well as to describe other human relationships like marriage. Matching theory evolved from an earlier framework called 'search theory'. Where search theory studies the microeconomic decision of an individual searcher, matching theory studies the macroeconomic outcome when one or more types of searchers interact.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] It offers a way of modeling markets in which frictions prevent instantaneous adjustment of the level of economic activity. Among other applications, it has been used as a framework for studying frictional unemployment.
One of the founders of matching theory is Dale T. Mortensen of Northwestern University. A textbook treatment of the matching approach to labor markets is Christopher A. Pissarides' book Equilibrium Unemployment Theory.[tpl]cite book |last=Pissarides |first=Christopher |year=2000 |title=Equilibrium Unemployment Theory |edition=2nd |location= |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-16187-7 [/tpl] Mortensen and Pissarides, together with Peter A. Diamond, won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Economics for 'fundamental contributions to search and matching theory'.Economic Prize Committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, 'Scientific Background', page 2.

[[.32 Long Colt]]
CATEGORIES: Colt's Manufacturing Company, Pistol and rifle cartridges

The .32 Long Colt (commonly called the .32 LC or simply  .32 Colt) is an American centerfire fire revolver cartridge.
Introduced by Colt's with the New Line revolver in 1873, the .32 Colt was inspired by the .320 Revolver.Barnes, p.155, ".320 Revolver". It originally used a .313 in (7.95 mm)-diameter 90 gr (5.8 g) outside-lubricated bullet, which was later changed to inside lubrication, leading to a diameter change to .299 in (7.59 mm), a slight reduction in bullet weight, and a shortening of overall length.Barnes, p.155, ".32 Long Colt—.32 Short Colt".
With a case lengthened by .31 in (7.87 mm) over the .32 Short Colt (which means the .32 SC will chamber and fire in any weapon designed for the LC), the .32LC is in the same class in power as the .32 Smith and Wesson Long,Barnes, p.155, ".32 Long Colt;—.32 Short Colt". without comparable accuracy.
More popular in Europe than North America, Colt was the most prominent American manufacturer which chambered any weapons in .32 Long Colt, most notably the Police Positive. Others included Marlin in their model 1892, Ballard in some single shot rifles, and other smaller manufacturers.[tpl]cn|date=December 2012[/tpl] The FAMAE revolver produced in Chile is currently offered in .32 Long Colt.[tpl]cite web |title=Famae 0.38 Special revolver (Chile), Pistols |url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Infantry-Weapons/Famae-0-38-Special-revolver-Chile.html |date=Jan 21, 2009 |work=Jane's Infantry Weapons |publisher= Jane's Information Group |accessdate=2009-06-13[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last = Jones| first = Richard| title = Jane's Infantry Weapons 2009-2010 | publisher = Jane's Information Group| year = 2009| isbn =0-7106-2869-2  | page =19[/tpl]

[[File:Memorial to Caleb Wright, Chowbent Chapel.JPG|right|thumb|Memorial to

Caleb Wright (1 August 1810 – 28 April 1898) was a mill owner and Liberal politician in Lancashire, north-west England.
He was one of thirteen children of William Wright, bookmaker of Tyldesley, near Manchester.Obituary, The Times, 29 April 1898, p. 10 At the age of nine he began work as a "piecer" in a local cotton mill.Biographies of Candidates, The Times, 29 June 1892, p.4 The only education he received was by attending night schools. At the age of fifteen he became a spinner, and rose to become manager of the mill in 1830. In 1841 he became manager of Ormerod and Hardcastles Mill, Bolton.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arnw02593.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/caleb_wright.htm |title=Caleb Wright, mill owner of Tyldesley and MP, 1810–1898 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Tyldesley and District Historical Society [/tpl]
In 1845 he established his own cotton-spinning business in partnership with Henry Barton. In 1855 the partnership was dissolved, and Caleb Wright and Company, Barnfield Mills, Tyldesley, established.
Wright was a Unitarian, a member of the congregation at Chowbent Chapel where he succeeded his father as organist.Lunn (1953), p. 141. 
Wright became involved in Liberal politics, and was chairman of Tyldesley Local Board and president of the local Mechanics' Institute. In the 1885 general election Caleb Wright was invited to stand as the candidate for the newly created Leigh division by the Liberal party. His Tory opponent was Lees Knowles who polled 3,725 votes as against 4,261 for Wright.  He was elected as the first member of parliament for the new constituency of Leigh. He was re-elected at the next two general elections, before retiring from parliament in 1895.News in Brief, The Times, 11 April 1894, p. 10 Politically Wright was an advanced radical, and supported both Home Rule for Ireland and women's suffrage. He was also a member of the Liberation Society which sought the disestablishment of the Church of England.The Liberation Society, The Times, 13 November 1885, p.7
Caleb Wright died at his home, Lower Oak, in Shakerley, Tyldesley in 1898 aged 87. He was a Unitarian and is buried at Chowbent Chapel.

[[MD6]]
CATEGORIES: NIST hash function competition

The MD6 Message-Digest Algorithm is a cryptographic hash function. It uses a Merkle tree-like structure to allow for immense parallel computation of hashes for very long inputs. Authors claim a performance of 28 cycles per byte for MD6-256 on an Intel Core 2 Duo and provable resistance against differential cryptanalysis.[ref]
  

  (Microsoft PowerPoint file)
[/ref]
Speeds in excess of 1 GB/s have been reported to be possible for long messages on 16-core CPU architecture.
The design of Merkle tree is based on the claims from Intel describing the future of hardware processors with tens and thousands of cores instead of the conventional uni-core systems. With this in mind, Merkle tree hash structures exploit full potential of such hardware while being appropriate for current uni/dual core architectures.
In December 2008, Douglas Held of Fortify Software discovered a buffer overflow in the original MD6 hash algorithm's reference implementation. This error was later made public by professor Ron Rivest on 19 February 2009, with a release of a corrected reference implementation in advance of the Fortify Report.http://blog.fortify.com/repo/Fortify-SHA-3-Report.pdf
MD6 was submitted to the NIST SHA-3 competition. However, on July 1, 2009, Rivest posted a comment at NIST that MD6 is not yet ready to be a candidate for SHA-3 because of speed issues, a "gap in the proof that the submitted version of MD6 is resistant to differential attacks", and an inability to supply such a proof for a faster reduced-round version,[tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/md6/OFFICIAL_COMMENT_MD6_2009-07-01.txt|title=OFFICIAL COMMENT: MD6|last=Rivest|first=Ronald|date=July 1, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl] although Rivest also stated at the MD6 website that it is not withdrawn formally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/md6.html|title=MD6 Withdrawn from SHA-3 Competition|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|date=July 1, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2009[/tpl] MD6 did not advance to the second round of the SHA-3 competition.

[[Agricultural Academy in Dublany]]
CATEGORIES: Educational institutions established in 1852, Education in Lviv, Lviv Polytechnic

Agricultural Academy in Dublany was one of the first Polish language schools of this kind. Its history dates back to 1852, when a farm in the village of Dublany (eight kilometers from the outskirts of Lwów, currently Lviv in Ukraine) was purchased by the Galicia Agricultural Society. Four years later, a private School of Village Agriculture was opened there and in 1858, the school was turned into the Agricultural College, with Leon Sapieha being the founder. In 1901 the school gained the rights of a university and was financed by the Galician authorities. However, it never received permission to issue doctorate degree, issuing only the agronomist diplomas. 
During the Polish-Ukrainian War, the Academy’s campus was destroyed and as a result, it was moved to Lwów, where in 1919 it was merged with the Lwów Polytechnic, creating Agricultural and Forestry Department. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, the campus consisted of two buildings, the main one constructed in 1888 and the laboratory complex, opened in 1900. Before World War I, it had around 1500 students, most of them from Congress Poland. Among its professors, there were such names as Stefan Dab-Biernacki, Juliusz Au and Wladyslaw Tyniecki. Most famous graduates include Stefan Alexandrowicz, Adam Brzechwa-Ajdukiewicz and Wlodzimierz Puchalski.

[[Zombie bank]]

CATEGORIES: Banking, Financial crises

A zombie bank is a financial institution that has an economic net worth less than zero but continues to operate because its ability to repay its debts is shored up by implicit or explicit government credit support.  The term was first used by Edward Kane in 1987 to explain the dangers of tolerating a large number of insolvent savings and loan associations and applied to the emerging Japanese crisis in 1993.  A zombie can continue to operate and even to grow as long as creditors remain confident in the relevant government's ability to extract the funds needed to back up its promises from current or future taxpayers. But when this ability seems doubtful, zombie institutions face runs by uninsured depositors and margin calls from counterparties in derivatives transactions.[tpl]cite book | first = Edward J. | last = Kane | title = The S&L Insurance Mess: How Did It Happen? | publisher = Urban Institute Press | location = Washington, D.C. | year = 1989 | isbn = 978-0-87766-468-0 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | first = Edward J.

LiR is an Irish rock band. Their sound has been described as "a fusion of funky progressive rock, folky mysticism and savvy pop". The band formed in the late 1980s in Dublin, firstly under the name The Spontaneous Frogs, then Uproar. They released their first EP All Machines Hum in A, in 1992.  In 1993, they released their first LP, Magico Magico! under the label Velo Records, (Velo was an Irish Indie) in Ireland.  In 1994, they re-released Magico Magico! to the US, under the independent record label What Are Records? (W.A.R.?).  The new version of the album saw a revision to the track listing.  LiR would release their second album, Nest, exclusively with W.A.R.?, the following year, in 1995. Around this time, they were notorious for playing constant shows in whelans bar, wexford street.The Support act was regularly by another Dublin band called Dragonfly.The lead Guitarist of dragonfly later became Lir's second guitarist, after the departure of keyboardist David hopkins. The Lir song "Temple Child" appeared on the What Are Records? Ammunition compilation album, a music sampler of various independent artists.  During the mid 90s, they released several EPs and an album through Velo Records that received UK releases only.  In 1997 they appeared on the soundtrack for the movie I Went Down, with the song "There Are More Things."

The band went on hiatus from 1997 to late 2000s, reuniting to play only a few shows a year in Dublin.  In 2006, the record label behind their US presence, What Are Records? released an album of tracks from Lir's early recording days, called 06/93 Acoustic Sessions.  The acoustic album was made available in mp3 digital format, via online download only.  Their latest release Lir Live came out on October 4, 2008, under the independent record label 1969 Records.  This album would be their first LP release in 13 years, since 1995's Nest. They were also sued by their manager for breach of contract after an aborted unsuccessful tour of the U.S. Their college art teacher once gave them this advice : 'best of music in the luck business' sadly, luck never played it's part and they failed to get a record deal.

John Lowe purchased the estate in 1747 from the last descendant of the Gilbert family. In 1790 the property was bequeathed to William Drury who changed his name by Royal Sign Manual dated 10 July 1790 to William Drury-Lowe. In 1792, he employed William Emes, who was responsible for the gardens of Calke Abbey and Kedleston Hall, to landscape the park; the actual work, including the creation of the 16 acre lake, was carried out by Emes' partner, John Webb.Frank Constable (June 1997), "Locko Park Gardens", Derbyshire Life 62 6 p38 Williams's daughter and heir, Mary-Anne, married Robert Holden in 1800. Their son William also took the name Drury-Lowe in 1849.
Substantial additions were made to the house in the 19th century by architect Henry Stevens of Derby, including, the present west range, the parapet to which bears the dates 1804 and 1896, and the Italianate tower which rises above it dating from 1853. The porch to the east front is dated 1861.
The house remains in the ownership of the Drury-Lowes, and is currently the residence of Lucy Palmer, the eldest daughter of Captain Patrick Drury-Lowe, and husband of David Palmer of the Huntley and Palmer biscuit family."Mrs David Palmer" (June 1997), Derbyshire Life 62 6 p37 The house is not generally open to the public, although it is available for corporate and private functions. Several members of the Drury-Lowe family have served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire. The park used to be host to a substantial herd of fallow deer, and some can still be seen in the area.

Siderúrgica del Turbio S.A. (Sidetur) was a subsidiary of Siderúrgica de Venezuela S.A. (Sivensa), the biggest - wholly private - Venezuelan steel corporation. Their main products are rebars, bars, beams, angles and flats. Sidetur develops their exporting activity in more than 25 countries in the markets of America, Africa, Asia and Europe. Their seven operating plants are located in the states of Bolívar, Carabobo, Miranda, Lara and the Capital District. Additionally, Sidetur has 14 ferrous material collection centers located in various cities.
Founded in 1948 in Antímano, Caracas, Sidetur now has six plants, all in Venezuela.
In 1998, Sivensa suffered a strong crisis - mainly due to the Asian Crisis - which reduced the size of the company and generated a big debt. Thanks to high steel prices, the situation of the company is improving with the years. Nowadays, the company has a capacity of annual production of 835,000 tons of steelmaking, 615,000 tons of rolling and 67,000 of electric welding.
In 2010 Sidetur was expropriated by the Chavez Government. As of May 21, 2013  no compensation was paid to former owners.http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/31/venezuelan-official-says-shareholders-will-be-paid-fair-price-for-expropriated/

The sun transit time, also referred to as sun-meridian transit time, is the time at which the sun passes over the observer's meridian line. Most often this time is used as local noon time and therefore will differ from longitude to longitude. For example, on April 29 the sun transit time in Boston, Massachusetts is 12:42 p.m., whereas the sun transit time for New York City, New York is 12:53 p.m. This is due to longitudinal distance between the two cities.

True Realm is a unique event in the gaming world. Open on only two days a year (April 3–4, 2009), the event is an indoor, 40,000 sq. ft. “theme park” for gamer geeks who want to immerse themselves in a world of medieval fantasy gaming.
The main attraction area is a 12,000 sq. ft. medieval fantasy city-scape where gamers can spend the day exploring True Realm and enjoying many immerse live-action events.  They can find the entrances to two HUGE Dungeons and Dragons type events with each being a two-hour adventure inside a vast walk-through D&D dungeon. They can also find themselves joining an assault to re-take a tower that has been occupied by three challenging monsters — or they might decide to prove their worth to join the Rogues’ Guild by trying to steal a chalice from a temple.  There are even surprise events that can only be found by careful exploration.
And, of course, there is an Inn that offers food and drink (as well as a good place to pick up a tabletop game), a Tavern where more boisterous gamers can enjoy a beer or two while reliving their latest dungeon exploits, a Courtyard that features street performances, interactive experiences and several contests

[[Merkle signature scheme]]
CATEGORIES: Digital signature schemes, Hash-based cryptography

The Merkle signature scheme is a digital signature scheme based on hash trees (also called Merkle trees) and one-time signatures such as the Lamport signature scheme. It was developed by Ralph Merkle in the late 1970s and is an alternative to traditional digital signatures such as the Digital Signature Algorithm or RSA. 
The advantage of the Merkle Signature Scheme is that it is believed to be resistant against quantum computer algorithms. The traditional public key algorithms, such as RSA and ELGamal would become insecure in case an effective quantum computer can be built (Shor's algorithm). The Merkle Signature Scheme however only depends on the existence of secure hash functions. This makes the Merkle Signature Scheme very adjustable and resistant against quantum computing.

[[Tetrabromoethane]]

CATEGORIES: Organobromides

Tetrabromoethane (TBE) is a halogenated hydrocarbon, chemical formula C2H2Br4. Although three bromine atoms may bind to one of the carbon atoms creating 1,1,1,2-tetrabromoethane this is not thermodynamically favorable, so in practice tetrabromoethane is equal to 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane, where each carbon atom binds two bromine atoms.
It has an unusually high density for an organic compound, near 3 g/mL, due largely to the four bromine atoms.Organic based heavy liquids, heavyliquids.com TBE is a liquid at room temperature, and is used to separate mineral ores from its supporting rock by means of preferential flotation. Sand, limestone, dolomite, and other types of rock material will float on TBE, while minerals such as sphalerite, galena and pyrite will sink. A related compound, bromoform, is also sometimes used in these applications, however, TBE is more practical because of its wider liquid range and lower vapor pressure.  Acute TBE poisoning has been known to occur.[tpl]cite journal | title = Acute tetrabromoethane (acetylene tetrabromide) intoxication in man | author = A B van Haaften | journal = American Industrial Hygiene Association | year = 1969 | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 251–256 | url=http://www.curehunter.com/public/pubmed5793994.do | doi = 10.1080/0002889698506042[/tpl]

[[Borderline intellectual functioning]]
CATEGORIES: Disability, Psychometrics, Intellectual disability

Borderline intellectual functioning, also called borderline mental retardation, is a categorization of intelligence wherein a person has below average cognitive ability (generally an IQ of 70-85),[tpl]cite journal |pmid=20537050|title=Working memory and executive function profiles of individuals with borderline intellectual functioning|author=TP Alloway|date=May 2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2010.01281.x|volume=54|issue=5|pages=448–56[/tpl] but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability (70 or below). It is sometimes called below average IQ (BAIQ). This is technically a cognitive impairment; however, this group is not sufficiently mentally disabled to be eligible for specialized services. Additionally, the DSM-IV-TR codes borderline intellectual functioning as V62.89,[tpl]cite book |author= |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] which is generally not a billable code, unlike the codes for mental retardation.
During school years, individuals with borderline intellectual functioning are often "slow learners."The Best Test Preparation for the Advanced Placement Examination in Psychology, Research & Education Association. (2003), p. 99  Although a large percentage of this group fails to complete high school and can often achieve only a low socioeconomic status, most adults in this group blend in with the rest of the population. Persons who fall into this categorization have a relatively normal expression of affect for their age, although their ability to think abstractly is rather limited.  Reasoning displays a preference for concrete thinking. They are usually able to function day to day without assistance, including holding down a simple job and the basic responsibilities of maintaining a dwelling.

CATEGORIES: Tall ships of the United Kingdom, Tall ships of Belgium, Individual sailing vessels

The Johanna  Lucretia is a British tall ship and is an oak wooden two masted topsail schooner built at the Rhoos Shipyard, Ghent in Belgium in 1945. The Johanna Lucretia measures 96ft (28.65m) in length, her beam is 18 ft (5.50m), her draught is 8 ft (2.45m) and she has a total sail area of 380 m2.
Although originally built as a fishing vessel, the Johanna Lucretia was never used for that purpose and was converted for recreational use in 1954, by the then owner Ber van Meer. She sailed in Dutch waters until 1989 from her port in Enkhuizen in the Netherlands. In 1989 the Johanna Lucretia was sold and transferred her base to Plymouth in the United Kingdom under the ownership of Mrs. Heather Henning.
In 1991/1992 she was refitted in Gloucester at the Tommy Nielson Yard and was used for charter mainly from Gibraltar, the Caribbean and the Eastern coast of the United States until 2001 after which she was sold to Cutlass Classic Charters Ltd.
The Johanna Lucretia has starred in the film The Riddle of the Sands in 1978 when she took the part of the Medusa and more recently in the film Amazing Grace - a drama about William Wilberforce's campaign to end the slave trade. She also starred in the Irish reality TV show Cabin Fever where she replaced the original Cabin Fever ship after it ran aground off Tory Island.

Animals is the debut album by Oxford based math rock band This Town Needs Guns. It had its UK release on 13 October 2008, under BSM Records, and on 10 March 2009 in the US, via Sargent House Records. It was recorded over the periods of March through May on a four weekend basis due to financial and personal demands.

Every song on the album continues the same theme of being named after different types of animals. During the writing and recording phase, the band named each song with temporary names in order to avoid calling them formal titles, such as "New Track 1", etc. So, they settled with names of animals as a fleeting substitute for the song names, hoping to change them before release. However, the band eventually couldn't decide on official names to replace them with, so the titles remained as they were.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.audioscribbler.co.uk/features/3766 | title=Animal Naming theme | accessdate=2008-10-07  | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081022022853/http://www.audioscribbler.co.uk/features/3766| archivedate= 22 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

[[Hope Emily Allen]]

Hope Emily Allen (1883–1960),[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/allen-hope/allen-hope.html|title=Letters of Hope Emily Allen|publisher=Bodleian Library at Oxford University[/tpl] a medieval scholar, is best known for her research on the 14th-century English mystic Richard Rolle and for her discovery of the Book of Margery Kempe.
Born in Oneida, New York, Allen spent a great deal of her childhood there and later also lived in Niagara Falls, Canada. Allen completed her undergraduate studies at Bryn Mawr College in 1905 with special interests in the study of Middle English literary texts. The next year she completed graduate work, also at Bryn Mawr, in English literature and Greek, earning a master's degree. Allen had great concern for women's values and identity and continued to fight for these issues throughout her life. After Bryn Mawr, she went to Radcliffe to begin studying for her Ph.D, during which time she enrolled at Cambridge University in 1910 for a semester to study English literature. That semester was eventually elongated to a period of three years.
Allen's time in Britain in the early 1900s allowed her to make a great number of personal and academic associations, as well as experience European culture. During her time in England, she pursued her two lifelong goals: medieval scholarship and feminism. Allen described herself as an "independent scholar," and she never accepted an academic teaching appointment. This independence allowed her to research more freely, so that she could closely examine texts that had not received recognition before. Her writing falls into three overlapping groups: her early work on the Ancrene Riwle, her insight into the study of Richard Rolle, and her research on the cultural background of The Book of Margery Kempe. Themes in her work include the spirituality of women in the late Middle Ages (Ancrene Riwle) and contradictions and impossibilities in the work of Richard Rolle.
In 1934, Allen identified the one surviving manuscript of the Book of Margery Kempe. She asked Stanley Brown Meech to collaborate with her in editing it.Kathryn Maude, 'Citation and Marginalisation: The Ethics of Feminism in Medieval Studies', Journal of Gender Studies, 23 (2014), 1-15 (pp. 8-9), http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09589236.2014.909719. 'However, Meech began mistreating Allen, and attempted to take over the edition' and 'eventually, the work was issued in two volumes, as the collaborators could not agree' on account of Meech's misogynistic attitude to Allen.Kathryn Maude, 'Citation and Marginalisation: The Ethics of Feminism in Medieval Studies', Journal of Gender Studies, 23 (2014), 1-15 (p. 9), http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09589236.2014.909719.
Allen later returned to the United States, living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she continued to pursue her research and writing. She eventually returned to her hometown of Oneida, New York, and spent the last years of her life at the Mansion House in Kenwood, where she died in 1960.Hope Emily Allen Papers at Bryn Mawr College Library, used with permission of the Special Collections department.
A biography of Allen was written J. C. Hirsch.J. C. Hirsh, Hope Emily Allen: Medieval Scholarship and Feminism (Norman, OK: Pilgrim Books, 1988). A significant collection of materials relating to her life can be found at the Bryn Mawr College Library. The papers consist primarily of research notes by Allen, photostats and typescripts of manuscripts, and professional correspondence. Topics include the Book of Margery Kempe, the Ancrene Riwle, and Richard Rolle.

The Belvedere Hotel is a Beaux Arts style building in Baltimore, Maryland.  Designed by the Boston architectural firm of Thomas and Parker and built in 1903, the Belvedere is a Baltimore landmark in the city's fashionable Mount Vernon neighborhood. The eleven-story building rises [tpl]convert|118|ft|0[/tpl] from a rusticated base to an elaborately-detailed Second Empire crown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=429&COUNTY=Baltimore%20City&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Baltimore%20City|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-07|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Baltimore City|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust[/tpl]
The hotel is named for its site on the former "Belvidere" estate of John Eager Howard. The hotel was known as the premier lodging in Baltimore during the first half of the twentieth century, hosting U.S. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Woodrow Wilson, among others, along with such celebrities as Wallis Warfield Simpson (the Duchess of Windsor), Douglas MacArthur, Clark Gable, and others.[tpl]cite web|title=The Belvedere: History|year=2003|publisher=Belvedere Hotel|url=http://www.belvederebaltimore.com/history.php|accessdate=2009-06-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090527022748/http://www.belvederebaltimore.com/history.php| archivedate= 27 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The partners retained the architectural firm of Parker and Thomas of Baltimore and Boston, and the construction firm of W. W. and E. A. Wells of Chicago. Parker and Thomas had designed the Homewood campus of The Johns Hopkins University some 30 years earlier. 
When it was completed, the Belvedere, according to early accounts was considered "something of a sensation for Baltimore." Over the years, it has figured prominently in Baltimore's social, political and economic life. In 1911, Woodrow Wilson, once a professor at the Johns Hopkins University, stayed at the Belvedere while attending the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore. That convention nominated him for President. 
Sheraton Hotels purchased the hotel in 1946 and operated it until 1968 as the Sheraton-Belvedere.http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/baltimore/baltimore_life_at_the_belvedere_jf12/
The hotel was converted to condominiums in 1991, although the building's ballrooms, restaurants, and lounges remain open to the public.

[[Predoctoral fellow]]
CATEGORIES: Educational stages

In the physical sciences, a predoctoral fellow ("pre-doc") refers to a researcher who has a bachelor's degree, but not a doctorate.  As the name implies, predoctoral fellows often use their time as a fellow to develop their skills and resume before applying to graduate school.  They differ from lab managers in that they primarily pursue research, rather than maintain the day-to-day function of a lab.  Pre-docs are often able to apply for their own sources of funding.
In natural sciences a pre-doc is usually used from a student registered in a Ph.D. program who needs labs not available in his/her home university. In Mathematics typically a pre-doc is again somebody already registered in a Ph.D. program at a host university to work together with a professor in a different topic with respect to his/her topic.

The Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU) was a part of the Specialist Crime Directorate of the Metropolitan Police Service in London, dedicated to combating e-crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The unit had a national remit, and was created in April 2008http://www.met.police.uk/pceu/index.htm to centralise the efforts of all police forces in the UK (excluding Scotland) to fight all forms of E-crime.
The unit's responsibilities were quite specific and included activities once carried out by other bodies while excluding other activities, currently done by others.[tpl]Clarify me|date=March 2009[/tpl]http://www.met.police.uk/pceu/remit_and_exclusions.html
The unit's stated mission was to improve the police response to victims of e-crime by developing the capability of the police service across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, co-ordinating the law enforcement approach to all types of e-crime, and by providing a national investigative capability for the most serious e-crime incidents.
The PCeU was created on 1 October 2008 and was responsible for improving the UK national policing response to cyber crime. The unit was housed within the Specialist Crime Directorate (SCD6) part of the Metropolitan Police Service based in central London. It had jurisdiction within England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

[[Soup]]

CATEGORIES: Soups, World cuisine

Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm (but may be cool or cold), that is made by combining ingredients such as meat and vegetables with stock, juice, water, or another liquid. Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth.
Traditionally, soups are classified into two main groups: clear soups and thick soups. The established French classifications of clear soups are bouillon and consommé. Thick soups are classified depending upon the type of thickening agent used: purées are vegetable soups thickened with starch; bisques are made from puréed shellfish or vegetables thickened with cream; cream soups may be thickened with béchamel sauce; and veloutés are thickened with eggs, butter, and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include egg,Thickening Soups. Bhg.com. Retrieved on 2013-05-02. rice, lentils, flour, and grains; many popular soups also include carrots and potatoes.
Soups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, soups generally have more liquid than stews.

[[Storage ring]]
CATEGORIES: Accelerator physics, Energy storage

A storage ring is a type of circular particle accelerator wherein a continuous or pulsed particle beam may circulate for many hours. Storing a particle depends upon its mass, energy and usually charge.  Storage rings most often  store electrons, positrons, or protons. 
Storage rings' most common application is storing electrons that emit synchrotron radiation.  Over 50 facilities are based on electron storage rings, used for various chemical and biological studies. Storage rings can  produce polarized high-energy electron beams via the Sokolov-Ternov effect.  Storage rings' best-known application is in particle accelerators and in particle colliders, wherein two counter-rotating beams of stored particles collide at chosen locations, the resulting subatomic interactions studied in a surrounding particle detector. Among synchrotron facilities are LHC, LEP, PEP-II, KEKB, RHIC, Tevatron and HERA.
A storage ring is a synchrotron that stores particles at a constant energy, and with radio-frequency cavities only replace energy lost through synchrotron radiation and other processes.
Gerard K. O'Neill proposed the use of storage rings as building blocks for a collider in 1956.  A key benefit of storage rings therein is their being able to accumulate a high beam flux from an injection accelerator that achieves a much lower flux.Gerard K. O'Neill, Storage-Ring Synchrotron:  Device for High-Energy Physics Research, Physical Review, Vol. 102 (1956); pages 1418-1419.

The Tenino people included four localized subtribes — the Tygh  (Taih, Tyigh) or "Upper Deschutes" divided in Tayxɫáma (Tygh Valley), Tiɫxniɫáma (Sherar's Bridge) and Mliɫáma (present Warm Spring Reservation), the Wyam (Wayámɫáma) or "Lower Deschutes", also known as "Celilo Indians", the Dalles Tenino or "Tinainu (Tinaynuɫáma)", also known as "Tenino proper"; and the Dock-Spus (Tukspush) (Takspasɫáma) or "John Day."
Historically splitting their time between winter camps and summer camps on the Columbia River, in 1855 the Tenino people were made a party to the Treaty with the Tribes of Middle Oregon, which was negotiated by Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs Joel Palmer. The Warm Springs bands are today a part of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, which governs the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in Central Oregon.

Membership remained stable until bassist Cliff Williams replaced Mark Evans in 1977. In 1979, the band recorded their highly successful album Highway to Hell. Lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980, after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but soon ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was selected as Scott's replacement. Later that year, the band released their best-selling album, Back in Black. The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was also highly successful and was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after the departure of drummer Phil Rudd in 1983. Poor record sales continued until the release of The Razors Edge in 1990. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's new album Black Ice was announced in June 2008 and was released on October 20, 2008. The album's first single, "Rock 'N Roll Train", earned AC/DC a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Group or Duo with Vocals. Another Black Ice track, "War Machine," gained AC/DC their first Grammy Award win, for Best Hard Rock Performance.
From 1982 to 1991, AC/DC have received several nominations from awards ceremonies for their music. The American Music Awards nominated the band for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group. The group received several nominations from the Grammy Awards, including Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for "Blow Up Your Video" in 1989, and Best Hard Rock Performance for three songs in different years: "The Razors Edge" in 1991, "Moneytalks" in 1992, and "Highway To Hell" in 1994. The band also received the nomination for Best Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Video for "Thunderstruck" in 1991 from the MTV Video Music Awards.
In 2009 AC/DC received four nominations for their 2008 album Black Ice in the ARIA Music Awards which included Best Rock Album, Highest Selling Album, Best Group and Best Album. They won the awards for Best Rock Album and Highest Selling Album.

Professor Hiroshi Ishiguro (石黒浩 Ishiguro Hiroshi) is director of the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory, part of the Department of Systems Innovation in the Graduate School of Engineering Science at Osaka University, Japan. A notable development of the laboratory is the actroid, a humanoid robot with lifelike appearance and visible behaviour such as facial movements.
In robot development, Professor Ishiguro concentrates on the idea of making a robot that is as similar as possible to a live human being; at the unveiling in July 2005 of the "female" android named Repliee Q1Expo, he was quoted as saying 
"I have developed many robots before, but I soon realised the importance of its appearance. A human-like appearance gives a robot a strong feeling of presence. ... Repliee Q1Expo can interact with people. It can respond to people touching it. It's very satisfying, although we obviously have a long way to go yet."Whitehouse, David, "Japanese develop 'female' android", BBC News, 27 July 2005] In his opinion, it may be possible to build an android that is indistinguishable from a human, at least during a brief encounter.
Ishiguro has made an android that resembles him, called the Geminoid. The Geminoid was among the robots featured by James May in his 5 October 2008 BBC2 documentary on robots Man-Machine in his series Big Ideas. Ishiguro has been listed as one of the 15 Asian Scientists To Watch by Asian Scientist Magazine on 15 May 2011.[tpl]cite news|title=The Ultimate List Of 15 Asian Scientists To Watch – Hiroshi Ishiguro|url=http://www.asianscientist.com/list/hiroshi-ishiguro//|date=May 15, 2011|work=AsianScientist.com|accessdate=June 6, 2011[/tpl]

[[Nascent state]]

CATEGORIES: Personality

The nascent state (Statu Nascenti) is defined as a psychological process of destructuration-reorganization where the individual becomes capable of merging with other persons and creating a new collectivity with a very high degree of solidarity. This concept was first defined by Francesco Alberoni, a prominent Italian sociologist, journalist, and professor in Sociology, in his book Statu Nascenti. However, the concept is referred to in much of his work. In his book Falling in Love and Loving, Alberoni defends that there are similarities to be found between massive collective movements and love relationships:
 
  Up till now, sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers have displayed a sort of repugnance or embarrassment in admitting that there is something in common—or better, something identical—to be found both in great historical processes like Islam, the French Revolution, or the Russian Revolution and in such personal, banal phenomena as the experience of falling in love. ...  
 In an analogous way, the falling-in-love process is the simplest form of a collective movement. ...  
 The definition given of the falling-in-love process (i.e. the nascent state of a collective movement made up of two people) offers us a theoretical slot in which to position this mysterious phenomenon of collective movements. Not only, but the same definition provides us with an extraordinary tool for investigating the nature of all such movements.  

Therefore, falling in love is seen as the nascent state of a collective movement formed of two people only. According to Francesco Alberoni, the phenomenology of falling in love is the same for young people and adults, for men and women and for homosexuals and heterosexuals. This is because the structure of the nascent state is always the same.

The report was incorporated into the Section 3 of the Education Ordinance of 1957 and served the basis of the educational framework for independent Malaya and eventually Malaysia.
The Razak Report is a compromise between the Barnes Report (favoured by the Malays) and the Fenn-Wu Report (favoured by the Chinese and Indians). The Barnes Report was formerly passed into law as the Education Ordinance of 1952. While the Razak Report forwards the Malay language as the main medium of instruction, [tpl]Fact|date=March 2009[/tpl] it allows the retention of other language medium schools. 
The Report provides for Malay, English, Chinese and Tamil schools at the primary school level, and Malay and English schools at the secondary school level. Malay-medium schools are referred to as "national" schools while other schools are referred to as "national-type" schools. All schools are government-funded and use a common national curriculum regardless of school type.

[[Dalesbred]]

CATEGORIES: Sheep breeds originating in England

The Dalesbred is a breed of domestic sheep originating in the United Kingdom. Derived from the Swaledale and Scottish Blackface breeds, the Dalesbred is a hill breed most common in the Central Pennines in England, particularly around Upper Wharfedale and Nidderdale. Very similar in appearance to its parent breeds, it has horns in both rams and ewes and a white carpet-quality fleece. It can be best distinguished by having a white spot on each side of its black face, with the end of the muzzle becoming grey.  This breed is primarily used for meat and wool production. The legs are free of wool and are mottled black and white. Dalesbred ewes weigh [tpl]Convert|45|to|60|kg||lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and rams [tpl]Convert|55|to|75|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. 
Dalesbred are a hardy breed capable of surviving the harsh conditions of upland terrain. They are generally bred for several generations in this environment, then ewes are sold to lowland farmers for cross breeding to produce mules. Ewes are often crossed with Teeswater rams to produce the Masham which is one of the most famous of British crossbreeds.
Due to the location and small extent of its distribution, this breed was threatened by culling in a Foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001.

[[Car supermarket]]

CATEGORIES: Auto dealerships

A car supermarket, also called a multi-make car dealer,auto superstore or car hypermarket, is a large independently owned, non francised motor car retail outlet. It may sell a mixture of used and new cars from various brands, especially new-to-three year old mass-market and ex-fleet vehicles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] Most use a "no-haggle" pricing model. 
Car supermarkets typically have in excess of 350 cars in one location, and the largest ones have up to 4,000 cars. This compares to less than 100 - 200 cars in stock for an average dealer forecourt, and allows consumers to find a wider choice while reducing the need for aggressive sales techniques. The vehicles are typically priced lower than in smaller car dealerships, based on volume sales and economies of scale. Examples of car supermarkets are CarMax and AutoNation in the US, Wilsons of Epsom, Motorpoint, Cargiant, UnbeatableCar and Carcraft in the UK.
Unlike auto rows where multiple dealerships are clustered together, car supermarkets are a single company offering a spread of vehicles from most of the major manufactures, whilst some dealership groups advertise as having a large choice of vehicles in Group stock, often this translates to a small number of vehicles per location and should not be regarded as a car supermarket.

The 2009 Gatorade Duels were a pair of [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] qualifying races for the 2009 Daytona 500, and were held on February 12, 2009 at the [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|km[/tpl] Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida.
The races set the field for the 51st running of "The Great American Race", and are the only races in the NASCAR Sprint Cup that qualifies drivers and their teams for a points-paying race.  The top 35 drivers from the previous season automatically made the "The Great American Race" regardless of position. Race One sets the field for spaces on the inside of the pole sitter (in this case, Martin Truex, Jr.), which is locked in via the traditional two-lap process on February 8, while Race Two sets the field on the outside behind other front row driver. The field for Race One consisted of the cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.) and Race Two conversely saw cars that qualified in even-numbered positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, etc.). All starting positions for the 500 were determined by the duels, except for the front row which is locked in after qualifying. In the races, the top two finishers not in the Top 35 from the previous season automatically qualify. The remaining cars are locked in via qualifying speeds, point owners exemptions and (if needed) a past champion's provisional going to the most recent past champion.
For the third consecutive year, a driver each from Joe Gibbs Racing and Hendrick Motorsports won the Duels.
Both races had spectacular finishes. In the first duel, Jeff Gordon beat out Tony Stewart, Joey Logano, Jimmie Johnson, and Aric Almirola. That group was within .40 of a second within each other on the last lap. Race two had Kyle Busch holding off Mark Martin, and Brian Vickers by .26 of a second over Martin and .264 of Vickers.

Hawthorne is a rail station located in Hawthorne, New Jersey in Passaic County. Volunteer Railroaders Association (aka VRA), a non-profit railroad preservation group leases the station from the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway. The station is single floor wooden structure at grade with the local area. Formerly brown and cream colored, the station has currently been repainted blue-green and red as part of an ongoing restoration.  The station once served as the commuter ticket office until June 30, 1966 and was also used as a freight depot building.
The original station at this location was built in 1872. In 1894 a fire destroyed the station and the station was rebuilt in a larger form. Since 1872, the present station has been located on the corner of Royal Avenue and County Route 654 (Diamond Bridge Avenue).
thumb|left|110px|Hawthorne Station prior to restoration. In 2010 the VRA undertook a massive fund raising needed to move the station. The move of just 75 feet within the same plot away from the corner was to alleviate the nearly monthly truck strikes to the southeast roof corner. As a part of this move a concrete brick and poured floor foundation was constructed. The move contractor hired made the move of the station onto the new foundation on September 20, 2010. After the move the areas of deteriorated siding were replaced and adding a new coat of paint was begun. Also added was a deck with safety railing, a fence between the station & the railroad and a garden area in the location of the old station footing.
It is proposed that New Jersey Transit will build a new station for the northern terminus of the Passaic-Bergen Rail Line adjacent to the NJ Transit Main Line's Hawthorne station several blocks away from this station.http://nyswpassengerrail.blogspot.com/  The neighbourhood of the original Erie mainline station would benefit from state funding to improve signage, lighting and parking.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/105413858_HAWTHORNE_PURSUES_TRANSIT_VILLAGE_STATUS.html|title=Hawthorne aims to spruce up rail neighborhood, end parking woes with 'transit village' concept|last=Shrestha|first=Kamana|date=October 21, 2010|work=The Record|publisher=North Jersey Media Group LLC|pages=1–2|accessdate=23 October 2010|location=Bergen County, New Jersey[/tpl]

Peter Wilson Raffan (1863 – June 23, 1940) was a British Liberal politician. 
Raffan came from Newbridge, Monmouthshire, and in 1910  was chairman of the Monmouthshire County Council.Candidates and Constituencies, The Times, January 1, 1910, p.6 When a general election was called in January 1910, P W Raffan was selected as Liberal candidate for Leigh in south Lancashire. John Brunner, the sitting Liberal member of parliament, had chosen to stand in Northwich.
The constituency contained a large number of coalminers, and Raffan was opposed not only by the Conservatives, but by Thomas Greenall of the Labour Party, who was a leader of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation. Leigh was one of the few seats where Labour and Liberals ran against each other.P F Clarke, Lancashire and the New Liberalism, Cambridge, 1971 Raffan won the seat easily.

[[The Army of the Republic]]
CATEGORIES: American thriller novels

The Army of the Republic, by Stuart Archer Cohen, is a book is set in a near-future United States where economic collapse and a one-party "democracy" has spawned a violent backlash.
The book centers around Lando, a Seattle urban guerrilla devoted to violent resistance, Emily, a political organizer in Seattle, and James Sands, a billionaire and government crony. Against this backdrop of mass politics and corporate armies, though, the book can be seen as an allegorical tale about a family at war with itself, too obsessed with status or with redemption to notice the abyss they're heading for.
Cohen draws heavily on his knowledge of South American revolutionary movements such as the Montoneros and the People's Revolutionary Army groups active in the 1970s. The book explores the full spectrum of citizen power, ranging from established methods such as ballot initiatives to civil disobedience to violent rebellion, carefully tracking the results of each method, and how they interact. The book also features two major demonstrations, the first of which was based on the 1999 WTO protests that became known as The Battle of Seattle.The real battle for Seattle, 5 Dec 1999 | World news | The Observer
Critics have called the book "brilliant, terrifying... too close for comfort" and "Thomas Paine meets Rage Against the Machine"Naomi Klein, David Maine. http://stuartarchercohen.com/

The team was known as the Montreal Expos from 1969 to 2004. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100322&content_id=8868046&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Marcum tapped for Jays' Opening Day|first=Jordan|last=Bastian|work=MLB.com|date=March 22, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2010[/tpl] though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day.[tpl]cite web|first=Steve|last=Dilbeck|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-clayton-kershaw-sydney-20140224,0,2715593.story#axzz2uMohA5cD|title=Dodgers may not start Clayton Kershaw in Sydney|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014[/tpl] The Nationals have used five different Opening Day starting pitchers in their nine seasons. The five starters have a combined Opening Day record of 1 win, 6 losses and 3 no decisions. No decisions are awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game, or if the starting pitcher does not pitch at least five innings with the lead. The overall Opening Day record of the team is 4–6.
Liván Hernández and Stephen Strasburg share the team record for most Opening Day starts with three.  Hernández has a record of 0–3. He also pitched one Opening Day start for the Montreal Expos, in which he received a no-decision. Hernández is the only pitcher to make an Opening Day start for both the Expos and the Nationals.  Strasburg has a record of 1–0 with two no decisions.
As the Washington Nationals, the team played their home games at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium from 2005 to 2007; their only home opener there was a 9–2 loss in 2007 by starter John Patterson. Nationals Park is the team's current field, and it was the site of the team's 2008 season opener, with starting pitcher Odalis Pérez on the mound in a game that the Nationals won 3–2 over the visiting Atlanta Braves.Antonen, Mel.

"Whatever You Like" is a song and single by "Weird Al" Yankovic, the first song from the digital EP Internet Leaks and was later released on his thirteenth studio album "Alpocalypse".  It is a direct parody of a song of the same name by T.I.. In a manner similar to T.I.'s song, the lyrics describe a man wooing a girlfriend with gifts that she may want, though, in light of recent economic problems, these are inexpensive or economical options, such as clipping coupons or going out to dinner at Burger King or McDonald's.
"Whatever You Like" is the first (and only) Yankovic parody to have exactly the same title as the original it parodies. Yankovic commented that thanks to a rapid approval from T.I. he was able to get permission for, write, record and upload the song to iTunes within 2 weeks and while the original song was still at No. 1 (it was there for 5 weeks).

[[Indiana Klan]]
CATEGORIES: History of Indiana, Ku Klux Klan by location, Organizations based in Indiana, Crime in Indiana, Political scandals in Indiana

The Indiana Klan was a branch of the Ku Klux Klan, a secret society in the United States that organized in 1915 to affect public affairs on issues of Prohibition, education, political corruption, and morality. It was most strongly anti-Catholic, but also opposed Jews and blacks. It opposed immigration from southern and eastern Europe, which was sharply reduced by a new law in 1923. In Indiana, the Klan generally did not practice overt violence but used intimidation in certain cases. Nationally it practiced racism and terrorism against minority ethnic and religious groups.
The Indiana Klan rose to prominence beginning in the early 1920s after World War I, when ethnic Protestants felt threatened by social and political issues, including changes caused by decades of heavy immigration from southern and eastern Europe. By 1922 the state had the largest organization nationally, and its membership continued to increase dramatically under the leadership of D.C. Stephenson. It averaged 2,000 new members per week from July 1922 to July 1923, when he was appointed as the Grand Dragon of Indiana. He led the Indiana Klan and other chapters he supervised to break away from the national organization in late 1923.
Indiana's Klan organization reached its peak of power in the following years, when it had 250,000 members, an estimated 30% of native-born white men. By 1925 over half the elected members of the Indiana General Assembly, the Governor of Indiana, and many other high-ranking officials in local and state government were members of the Klan. Politicians had also learned they needed Klan endorsement to win office.
That year Stephenson was charged and convicted for the rape and murder of Madge Oberholtzer, a young schoolteacher. His vile behavior caused a sharp drop in Klan membership, which decreased further with his exposure to the press of secret deals and the Klan's bribery of public officials. Denied pardon, in 1927 Stephenson began to talk to the Indianapolis Times, giving them lists of people who had been paid by the Klan. Their press investigation exposed many Klan members, showed they were not law-abiding, and ended the power of the organization, as members dropped out by the tens of thousands. By the end of the decade, the Klan was down to about 4,000 members and finished in the state. Efforts by some to revive it in the period of the 1960s and 1970s were not successful.

CATEGORIES: Croatian pop music groups, Musical groups established in 1994

Jinx is a Croatian Pop band from Zagreb which was formed in 1993. They began their career under the name "High Jinx" coming from a concert in a Zagreb night-club saloon. The members of Jinx are guitarist Coco Mosquito, vocalist Jadranka Bastajic Yaya, drummer Berko Muratovic, keyboardist Mr. Goody, trumpet player Igor Pavlica and bassist Adam Matijasevic. Former members of the band are Goony, Kiky the Kid, bassist Samir Kadribasic, trumpet player Rudi and saxophone player Jordes.

Mud (Persian: مود, also Romanized as Mūd and Mood; also known as Mood Nahar Khan and Mūd-e Dahanāb)[tpl]GEOnet3|-3075983[/tpl] is a city in and the capital of Mud District, in Sarbisheh County, South Khorasan Province, Iran. Formerly up to the division of the Province from Khorasan it was a borough of today South Khorasan's provincial capital Birjand. At the 2006 census, its population was 2,451, in 695 families.[tpl]IranCensus2006|29[/tpl]
Archaeologists excavating in the southern historical town of Mud in South Khorasan province have unearthed ancient earthenware dating back to the Parthian dynastic era (248 BCE-224 CE).
Excavations were conducted on an ancient mound located near the city of Birjand. Numerous historical artifacts dating back from the pre-historic eras up to the Safavid dynasty were found at the site.
The last prince of Birjand was Shah Seyyed Ali Kazemi who came from Mud (where most people were related with him), a relative of the emperor Shah Reza Pahlavi and the Prime minister Asadollah Alam.
The area is known for Mud blankets and carpets that have normally a curvilinear design with a sun flower shaped picture in the center. The production of such carpets is usually high-quality. These carpets are made of wool or cotton. They attained their valuation by the decree of the Persian Safavid emperor Shah Abbas I, who not only arranged the building of the fortresses in this region, but also retained the original Persian design styles and knot techniques.

[[A Darker Domain]]

CATEGORIES: 2008 novels, Novels by Val McDermid, Detective novels, Scottish thriller novels, Fife, Novels set in Scotland, 1984 in fiction

A Darker Domain is a 2008 psychological thriller novel by Scottish crime writer Val McDermid. Reviewers often noted the fast paced style of the novel as it flashes back and forth between two plot lines, a contemporary crime in 2007 and the investigation of a cold case from 1984. The novel is set in during the UK miners strike of 1984–1985 in Fife. Her accounts of the strike are particularly pointed, exploring the effects of the strikes on the emotions of the people involved and their community. McDermid was raised in Fife, and one reviewer credits her accurate review of the strikes to her experiences earlier in her life. The reviews of the book were generally good, many of the reviewers comparing the book to her previous novels. The New York Times named the book one of the "Notable Crime Books of 2009."[tpl]cite news| title = The Notable Crime Books of 2009| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/books/review/Crime-t.html|first = Marilyn Stasio| date = 3 December 2009| newspaper = New York Times| accessdate =24 February 2011[/tpl]

[[Selby Coalfield]]
CATEGORIES: Coal mines in North Yorkshire, Selby

Selby coalfield (also known as the Selby complex, or Selby 'superpit') was a large scale deep underground mine complex based around Selby, North Yorkshire, England, with pitheads at Wistow Mine, Stillingfleet Mine, Riccall Mine, North Selby Mine, Whitemoor Mine and at Gascoigne Wood Mine; all coal was brought to the surface and treated at Gascoigne Wood, being distributed onwards by rail. The primary purpose of the pit was to supply coal for electrical power generation; much of it was used in the nearby Aire valley power stations.
Mining peaked in 1993–4 at 12 million tonnes. The mines were acquired by RJB Mining in 1997 after the privatisation of the coal industry; loss of subsidy, geological problems, and low UK coal prices made the pits unprofitable by the 21st century. Closure was announced in 2002, and mining completely ceased by 2004.

[[Organism]]
CATEGORIES: Life, Organisms

In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, insect, plant or bacterium. All known types of organism are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and self-regulation (homeostasis).
An organism may be either unicellular (a single cell) or, as in the case of humans, comprise many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. The term multicellular (many cells) describes any organism made up of more than one cell.
An organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains, the Bacteria and Archaea. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles 
(such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae, all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria).[tpl]cite pmid|3113314|noedit[/tpl] Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes.
In 2002, Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed a clade, Neomura, which groups together the Archaea and Eukarya. Neomura is thought to have evolved from Bacteria, more specifically from Actinobacteria.T. Cavalier-Smith (2002) The neomuran origin of archaebacteria, the negibacterial root of the universal tree and bacterial megaclassification.

John ("Little Caesar") Acropolis (1909 - August 26, 1952), was an American labor leader. He served as president of Local 456 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in Westchester County, NY from 1946 until his death.
Acropolis was orphaned at age three and raised in a series of charitable institutions.  He attended Colgate University where he played on the basketball team.
Acropolis became interested in union issues while working as a truck driver during summer break from college.  He joined Local 456 and was first elected as a union officer in the early 1940s.
After becoming president of Local 456, Acropolis challenged the Genovese crime family over its control of certain garbage carting contracts in the suburbs of New York City.  He expanded the size of his local to more than 2,000 members.
Acropolis was killed in 1952 by an unknown assailant who fired two bullets into his head.  The case has not been solved.
In October, 2008, the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the Yonkers, New York Police Department, demanding access to the department's file on the investigation into the death of Acropolis.  The City of Yonkers said it would fight the lawsuit, claiming that because the investigation was still technically active, the case file was not subject to Freedom of Information laws.

[[Spawn (biology)]]

CATEGORIES: Reproduction in animals, Ichthyology, Articles containing video clips

Spawn is the eggs and sperm released or deposited, usually into water, by aquatic animals. As a verb, spawn refers to the process of releasing the eggs and sperm, also called spawning. Most aquatic animals, apart from aquatic mammals, reproduce through a process of spawning.
Spawn consists of the reproductive cells (gametes) of aquatic animals, some of which will become fertilized and produce offspring. The process of spawning typically involves females releasing ova (unfertilized eggs) into the water, often in large quantities, while males simultaneously or sequentially release spermatozoa (milt) to fertilize the eggs.Spawn Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011.Spawning Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011.Gametes Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011.
Most fish reproduce by spawning, and so do most other aquatic animals, including crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps, molluscs such as oysters and squid, echinoderms such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers, amphibians such as frogs and newts, other amphibious animals such as turtles, aquatic insects such as mayflies and mosquitoes, and corals (which are small aquatic animals and not plants). Fungi, such as mushrooms, are also said to "spawn" a white fibrous matter that forms the matrix from which they grow.
There are many variations in the way spawning occurs, depending on sexual differences in anatomy, on how the sexes relate to each other, on where and how the spawn is released, and on whether or how the spawn is subsequently guarded.

This was followed by a string of attacks against Western targets. For many years he was among the most wanted international fugitives.

For his part, Ramírez Sánchez denied the 1975 killings, saying they were orchestrated by Mossad, the Israeli secret service, and condemning Israel as a terrorist nation. During his trial in France in 1997, he said, "When one wages war for 30 years, there is a lot of blood spilled—mine and others.

Newton's current interests, however, are focused on  how fatigue develops, and she proposes "postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome" as a possible cause of chronic fatigue syndrome. She has also worked to establish a link between autonomic dysfunction and muscle fatigue linking POTS with abnormal muscle PH and proton efflux.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Jones|first=D.|coauthors =Hollingsworth K., Taylor R., Blamire A., Newton J.|title=Abnormalities in pH Handling by Peripheral Muscle and Potential Regulation by the Autonomic Nervous System in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome|journal=Journal of Internal Medicine|volume=9999|issue=999A|pages=394|publisher =Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=|year=2009|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122564291/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.2009.02160.x|id=|accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl]

Pangaea ([tpl]IPAc-en|p|æ|n|ˈ|dʒ|iː|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|pan|JEE|ə[/tpl];OED) was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, forming approximately 300 million years ago. It began to break apart around 100 million years after it formed.Plate Tectonics and Crustal Evolution, Third Ed., 1989, by Kent C. Condie, Pergamon Press The single global ocean which surrounded Pangaea is accordingly named Panthalassa.
The name Pangaea is derived from Ancient Greek pan (πᾶν) meaning "entire", and Gaia (Γαῖα) meaning "Mother Earth".[tpl]cite web|title=Pangaea|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Pangaea&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary[/tpl]Pangaeus was also the ancient name for a mountain range in southern Thrace. It is used in its plural form Pangaea in Vergil, Georgics 4, 462, and Lucan, Pharsalia 1, 679 (C.T. Lewis & C. Short, A Latin Dictionary (New York, 1879), s.v. "Pangaeus"). According to the scholiast on Lucan, the name means "all land" ('Pangaea' id est totum terra) on account of its smooth terrain and unexpected fertility (H. Usener, Scholia in Lucani Bellum Civile, first part (Leipzig, 1869), p. 45). The name was coined during a 1927 symposium discussing Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift.[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl] In his book The Origin of Continents and Oceans (Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane), first published in 1915, he postulated that prior to breaking up and drifting to their present locations, all the continents had at one time formed a single supercontinent which he called the "Urkontinent". The name occurs in the 1920 and 1922 editions of Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane, but only once, when Wegener refers to the ancient supercontinent as "the Pangaea of the Carboniferous"."Schon die Pangäa der Karbonzeit hatte so einen Vorderrand..." (1920 edition, p. 120; 1922 edition, p. 130). See Wegener, A.; Krause, R.; Thiede, J. (2005).

Katie Green (born 28 August 1987) is an English model from Chichester, West Sussex. Her potential was initially recognised by a Surrey photographer who arranged a test-shoot for her at Image Park Studio in West Sussex, paving the way for her successful modelling career.
Green was originally signed to represent Wonderbra in July 2008, but Premier Model Management agency immediately pressured her to lose [tpl]convert|2|st[/tpl] and two dress sizes. She ended her contract in October 28 when she refused to lose weight. She shortly afterward signed a contract to represent Ultimo which continued until October 2009 when Ultimo released her when she was photographed topless on a beach in violation of her contract. Green is unusual among models because of her height and weight and her refusal to lose weight to conform to the norms agencies expect of models. She initiated a campaign against size zero models. Green continues to model and has appeared in numerous publications and campaigns.

He was born in McRoberts, Kentucky, grew up in Youngstown, Ohio and was listed at [tpl]convert|6|ft|1|in[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|175|lb[/tpl].
Toth was part of the "Brock for Broglio" trade on June 15, 1964: he accompanied outfielder Lou Brock and left-handed relief pitcher Jack Spring in a trade to the Cardinals, in exchange for starting pitcher Ernie Broglio, left-handed relief pitcher Bobby Shantz and outfielder Doug Clemens. Brock went on to help lead the Cardinals to three National League championships and two World Series titles — including one in 1964 — and setting a new career record for stolen bases. Toth, who was pitching at Triple-A for the Cubs at the time of the trade, remained in the minor leagues for the rest of his career.Minor league statistics from Baseball Reference

On September 1, 1962, he was traded to the Cubs for pitcher Harvey Branch, and made six more appearances for the Cubs, including four starts, before the 1962 campaign ended, with Toth winning four of five decisions and posting an earned run average of 4.62. Toth then spent the entire [tpl]by|1963[/tpl] season on the Cub roster, appearing in 27 games played, 14 as a starter, and compiling a 3.10 ERA with two shutouts. Toth was ineffective in two May 1964 startsRetrosheet and was sent to the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League after only four total games in Chicago.

[[Attachment-based therapy (children)]]

CATEGORIES: Attachment theory, Psychotherapy, Adoption, fostering, orphan care and displacement

Attachment-based therapy is a phrase intended to apply to interventions or approaches based on attachment theory, originated by John Bowlby. These range from individual therapeutic approaches to public health programs to interventions specifically designed for foster carers.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|author=Berlin L, Zeanah CH and Lieberman AF|title=Prevention and Intervention Programs for Supporting Early Attachment Security|editor=Cassidy J and Shaver PR|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|quote=Supporting early child-parent relationships is an increasingly prominent goal of mental health practitioners, community based service providers and policy makers.....  Attachment theory and research have generated important findings concerning early child development and spurred the creation of programs to support early child-parent relationships|year=2008|edition=2nd|location=New York:London|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=745–61|isbn=978-1-60623-028-2[/tpl] Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of socioemotional development with one of the broadest, deepest research lines in modern psychology, attachment theory has, until recently, been less clinically applied than theories with far less empirical support. This may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also be partly due to the mistaken association of attachment theory with the pseudo-scientific interventions misleadingly known as attachment therapy.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|author=Ziv Y| title=Attachment-Based Intervention programs: Implications for Attachment Theory and Research|encyclopedia= Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |series= Duke series in child development and public policy |editor= Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L and Greenberg MT|year=2005|publisher= Guilford Press |isbn= 1-59385-470-6|page=63[/tpl] The approaches set out below are examples of recent clinical applications of attachment theory by mainstream attachment theorists and clinicians and are aimed at infants or children who have developed or are at risk of developing less desirable, insecure attachment styles or an attachment disorder.

Gotthard Friedrich Stender ([tpl]lang-lv|Gothards Frīdrihs Stenders[/tpl]; 1714-1796) was the first Latvian grammarian and lexicographer, founder of the Latvian secular literature in the 18th century.  G.F. Stender in the spirit of the Enlightenment produced didactic tales and idyllic poems. The first Latvian popular encyclopedia of science «The Book of High Wisdom» was also written by him in 1774.
Gotthard Friedrich Stender played an outstanding role in Latvia's history of culture. He wrote secular poetry ranging from philosophical odas to the grandeur of nature to unpretencious folksy songs, which widely influenced the literary taste of the nation, and won extreme popularity. His works, although written mainly for the 18th century people, promoted the education in Latvian schools throughout the whole 19th century.
G.F.Stender updated Latvian ABC, compiled a comprehensive Latvian grammar book and a dictionary, which had been used not only by Latvians and German Balts, but also by foreign linguists from all Europe of the time period. G.F.Stender along with Johann Gottfried Herder was the first author, who analysed Latvian folksongs, riddles, proverbs and sayings.

William Henry Singleton (1843-1938) was an American slave from North Carolina who became a Union soldier during the American Civil War. As a freedman, he moved to New England, where he became a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AME Zion Church) in Portland, Maine. He wrote and published his autobiography in 1922, an account of his rise from slavery of the genre known as slave narratives.
During the American Civil War, Singleton escaped to Union forces and gained his freedom. In the summer of 1863, he recruited and helped lead the First North Carolina Colored Volunteers, which became part of the 35th United States Colored Troops. After being wounded in the Battle of Olustee, Florida in February 1864, he was assigned to garrison duty.
Following the war and his honorable discharge, in 1866 Singleton moved to Connecticut, where he worked and taught himself to read and write. He joined the AME Zion Church, and became a missionary and minister, serving in Portland, Maine. Later he lived and worked in Peekskill, New York. At the age of 95, Singleton marched in a parade of Civil War veterans in Des Moines, Iowa, shortly before his death.

USS ''Zaanland'' (Id. No. 2746) was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy in 1918.
SS Zaanland was a steel-hulled, single-screw cargo vessel completed in 1900 at Port Glasgow, Scotland, by Russell and Company. The Royal Dutch Lloyd line owned her at the outbreak of World War I. The ship sought security at Hampton Roads, Virginia, lest, at sea, she fall prey to warships of the Royal Navy
On 20 March 1918, Zaanland was seized at Newport News, Virginia, by the United States Government under the right of angary, which allowed a belligerent power to use the property of a neutral nation if necessary, subject to full indemnification. She was acquired by the United States Navy for use by the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) on 25 March 1918, the cargo ship was assigned the identification number (Id. No.) 2746 and commissioned as USS Zaanland at Hampton Roads on 29 March 1918, Lieutenant Commander Daniel Brown, USNRF, in command.
Zaanland was repaired and fitted out at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, before sailing for the Gulf of Mexico on 4 April. Arriving at New Orleans, Louisiana on 11 April, she simultaneously underwent further repairs and conversion work and loaded [tpl]convert|4946|LT|t|abbr=on[/tpl] of general cargo consigned by the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps. She departed New Orleans on 20 April and arrived back at Hampton Roads on 25 April.
Zaanland sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 30 April, in Convoy HN-67, bound for La Pallice, France. During the voyage, in a heavy mist at 20:26 on 12 May, she apparently suffered a rudder casualty and was rammed by the tanker [tpl]USS|Hisko|ID-1953[/tpl]. The collision tore a jagged, [tpl]convert|15|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl] hole in the cargo ship's starboard side, amidships between her bridge and fire room. Zaanland soon assumed a heavy list and began to sink by the bow. At 20:40, all hands were called topside as boats were launched. Within an hour, all of Zaanland[tpl]'[/tpl]s crew were safely aboard the United States Army-chartered Munson Line cargo ship SS Munalbro, which later in 1918 would be commissioned into the U.S. Navy as [tpl]USS|Munalbro|1916|6[/tpl].
Although settling deeper in the water with each passing hour, Zaanland remained afloat into the next day. At 04:00 on 13 May, Lt. Cdr. Brown reboarded Zaanland and inspected the ship. He found that there was no hope of towing the vessel to port and predicted that she probably would sink within a few hours. His observation proved to be correct, for Zaanland sank, bow first, at 07:10 on 13 May.
Munalbro — while endeavoring to overtake the convoy — soon met SS Minnesota en route, and transferred Zaanland[tpl]'[/tpl]s crew to the west-bound vessel for passage back to the United States.

Sullivan, who was the main promoter, was sentenced to two years in prison while McCleester and the others received light jail sentences or fines. McCleester had served as one of the cornermen during the bout.Downey, Fairex. Our Lusty Forefathers. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1947. (pg. 310)

After the 16th round, McCleester signaled to the referee to stop the match. Three months later, he and Dirty Face Jack assisted Rynders in instigating the Astor Place Riot in which an Irish-American mob chased British actor William Charles Macready from the Astor Opera House. 
He was among several prominent sportsmen who supported Rynders when, in the autumn of 1850, he announced his intention to become active in the Sixth Ward and run for the state assembly. McCleester was present along with Bill Ford, Tom Maguire and Hen Chenfrau when Rynders attended the primary meeting at Dooley's Long Room with "hundreds of the captain's friends". Opposition from Matthew T. Brennan, Constantine J. Donoho and other Five Points political leaders however, who considered the political club thugs and squatters, eventually defeated Rynders over control of the ward.Kernan, J. Frank.

It is also known as the Black Apple because its skin is very dark red, appearing almost black. It is a dessert apple with sweet white firm flesh. It was once used for the production of cider. This variety is notable for a cross with a McIntosh red to produce the Macoun, which was formerly thought to have produced the Honeycrisp.

[[Arthur Cecil]]
CATEGORIES: People associated with Gilbert and Sullivan, English male stage actors, English male singers, English humorists, 1843 births, 1896 deaths, People from Mayfair

Arthur Cecil Blunt, better known as Arthur Cecil (1 June 1843 – 16 April 1896) was an English actor, comedian, playwright and theatre manager.  He is probably best remembered for playing the role of Box in the long-running production of Cox and Box, by Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand, at the Royal Gallery of Illustration.
Born in London, Cecil took up amateur dramatics from an early age. In 1869, he made his professional debut in the one-act comic opera Cox and Box at the Gallery of Illustration in the role of Mr. Box, a part that became his signature role.  There Cecil started a successful association with the German Reed Entertainments, appearing in numerous comedies, farces, operettas and burlesques, such as Beggar My Neighbour: A Blind Man's Bouffe and Charity Begins at Home in 1872. He remained with the company for five years.
Cecil appeared at many London theatres during his career including the Globe, the Gaiety, and Prince of Wales's Theatre.  He appeared in such successful pieces as Peril as Sir Woodbine Grafton, Duty, The Vicarage, as Noel Haygarth and Caste by T. W. Robertson with the Bancrofts also in the cast, all in 1879, and later in other Robertson pieces.  Cecil joined a company at the Royal Court Theatre in 1881 and was a co-manager of that theatre from 1883.  There, he played in farces including The Rector, The Magistrate, The Schoolmistress and Dandy Dick, as well as the title role in The Cabinet Minister in 1890. Later productions there included The Millionaire, as Mr. Guyon, and Mamma, as Miles Henniker.

Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, [tpl]scite|552|148|2008[/tpl], was a decision by the United States Supreme Court pertaining to the scope of liability of secondary actors, such as lawyers and accountants, for securities fraud under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  In a 5-3 decision authored by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that "aiders and abettors" of fraud cannot be held secondarily liable under the private right of action authorized by §10(b) of the Exchange Act.  Such defendants can only be held liable if their own conduct satisfies each of the elements for §10(b) liability.  Therefore, the plaintiff must prove reliance, in making a decision to acquire or hold a security, upon a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant.

Newton Knight (November 1837 – February 16, 1922) was an American farmer, soldier and Southern Unionist, best known as the leader of the Knight Company, a band of Confederate Army deserters that turned against the Confederacy during the Civil War.  Local legends state that Knight and his men attempted to form the "Free State of Jones" in the area around Jones County, Mississippi, at the height of the war, though the exact nature of the Knight Company's opposition to the Confederate government is disputed.  After the war, Knight aided Mississippi's Reconstruction government.
Knight has long been a controversial figure.  Historians and descendants disagree over his motives and actions, with some arguing he was a noble and pious individual who refused to fight against a cause in which he did not believe, while others have portrayed him as a manipulative outlaw.  This controversy was fueled in part by Knight's postwar marriage to a former slave, which effectively established a small mixed-race community in southeastern Mississippi.
The 1942 James H. Street novel, Tap Roots, was inspired by Knight's actions in the Civil War.  The novel was the basis for the 1948 film of the same name, which was directed by George Marshall.

The Nutcracker has since become known as The Nutcracker in Savannah. Every year the show features a special guest. Guests such as Paula Deen, Mary and Stratton Leopold, and Bobby Deen have been in the show.
Dancers such as Caroline Bragg-Brennan, Amber Amick, Colleen McCarthy, Abigail Braddy, Maggie de la Sierra, and Megan Foster have come out of Savannah Danse Theatre.

[[Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver]]

CATEGORIES: United States Supreme Court cases, United States securities case law, 1994 in United States case law, Implied statutory cause of action case law

Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. 164 (1994), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held private plaintiffs may not maintain aiding and abetting suit under Securities Exchange Act § 10(b).
The majority opinion in the case established that liability did not extend to “aiders or abettors” that participate in misstatements or omissions in connection with the sale of securities. The Supreme Court held that "private civil liability under Rule 10b-5 does not extend to those who do not engage in a manipulative or deceptive practice but who aid and abet such a violation of 10(b)." This distinguished between the primary liability of violators of Rule 10b-5 and non-primary defendants, who had not directly deceived investors. This was a more literal reading than hitherto of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 10b-5, which prohibit fraud or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
The Supreme Court's ruling reversed a long history of court decisions and SEC enforcement actions where aiders and abettors, often banks, accountants, trustees, and attorneys, were found liable under Rule 10b-5. The case makes the distinction between primary violators, who directly misstate or omit material facts that are relied upon by investors, and aiders and abettors. According to the court:  “A plaintiff must show reliance on the defendant's misstatement or omission to recover under 10b-5. Basic Inc. v. Levinson, supra, at 243. Were we to allow the aiding and abetting action proposed in this case, the defendant could be liable without any showing that the plaintiff relied upon the aider and abettor's statement or actions. . . .".  When investors relied on such statements or actions, the court extends Rule 10b-5 liability to these secondary participants. The Court stated that "any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5. . .."

The SS ''William B. Davock'' was a lake freighter that was constructed in 1907 by Great Lakes Engineering Works, at their St. Clair, MI facility for the Vulcan Steamship Co. (R.H. Pigott, Mgr.).  She was operated by Vulcan Steamship from 1907 to 1915 in The Great Lakes coal, iron ore, grain and stone trades.  In 1915 the ship came under the management of The Interlake Steamship Co. (Pickands Mather & Co., Mgrs.).  While laid up for the winter (1922-23) in Fairport, Ohio, she was reconstructed and updated, this work lead to a tonnage change in the amount of 4220 gross - 2671 net.  The Davock resumed its traditional trade pattern of coal carried to upper lakes ports from Lake Erie and iron ore from Lake Superior ports to the steel mills of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan.  
This routine was permanently disrupted on November 11, 1940 as a ferocious storm swept the lakes late on that Monday afternoon.  Considered to be the worst storm to that point on Lake Michigan it saw 75 mph winds and rain turning to snow.  Several vessels transiting Lake Michigan were caught with little warning.  The Davock making her way down the lake with coal for Chicago was presumably overwhelmed at the height of the storm succumbing to the intense wind and waves, and slipping to her final resting place ~200 feet below the surface five miles out from Little Sable Point between Ludington, Michigan and Pentwater, Michigan.  None of the 32 (some sources cite 33) hands survived.  In total the storm took two vessels and their entire crews (Davock, and Kinsman Steamer Anna C. Minch).  Several other vessels were damaged, or ran aground trying to escape the storm's fury.  Overall estimates state 59 sailors were lost in what would be the worst maritime disaster on the Great Lakes since the Great Storm of 1913.

Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 (eIF2) is a eukaryotic initiation factor. It is required in the initiation of translation. eIF2 mediates the binding of tRNAmet to the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. eIF2 is a heterotrimer consisting of an alpha (also called subunit 1), a beta (subunit 2), and a gamma (subunit 3) subunit.
Once the initiation is completed, eIF2 is released from the ribosome bound to GDP as an inactive binary complex. To participate in another round of translation initiation, this GDP must be exchanged for GTP.

CATEGORIES: Staffordiidae

Staffordiidae is a family of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Staffordioidea (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
Staffordiidae is the only family in the superamily Staffordioidea. This family has no subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
Staffordiidae is a poorly known family, because it occurs only in the Dafla Hills area of India. The fauna and flora of that area is very insufficiently known in general.
Various sources consider the family Staffordiidae as part of DyakiidaeBarker G. M. (2001) Gastropods on Land: Phylogeny, Diversity and Adaptive Morphology. 1-146. In: Barker G. M. (ed.)

[[Behavioral communication]]
CATEGORIES: Communication

Behavioral Communication is a psychological construct that addresses people's use of day-to-day behaviors as a form of communication. Specifically, it refers to people's tendency to express feelings, needs, and thoughts by means of indirect messages and behavioral impacts.
Any behavior (or its absence when one is expected) may be judged as communicative if it has the intent to convey a message. For example, an expressive hairstyle, a show of a certain emotion, stonewalling (emotional withdrawal), or simply doing (or not doing) the dishes all can be means by which people may convey messages to each other. 
The construct of behavioral communication is conceived as a variable of Individual differences. This means that some people more than others tend to engage in behavioral communication in spite of the plausible alternatives of using verbal communication.
A measure of the construct, The Behavioral Communication Questionnaire (M. Ivanov, 2008), has been introduced at the Society for Personality Assessment conference in March, 2008.
The conceptual framework of the construct has been presented at Western Psychological Association Conferenc e in April, 2008. 
In March 2010, a manuscript detailing the construct and its measurement has been published by the journal of Personality and Individual Differences, an official scientific journal for the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences. This manuscript is authored by Michael Ivanov, Ph.D. and by Paul D. Werner, Ph.D., professor of psychology from the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University.  
The current citation of this article: Ivanov, M., & Werner, P. D. Behavioral communication: Individual differences in communication style. Personality and Individual Differences (2010), [tpl]doi|10.1016/j.paid.2010.02.033[/tpl]
A second phase of the research into behavioral communication has been completed in 2012. In this study, the role of behavioral communication was explored within the context of romantic relationships and within a larger array of personality and communication variables. The report has been published as a part of the doctoral dissertation titled Perceptual Agreement: Reality and Illusion in Romantic Relationships by Michael Ivanov, Ph.D. Researchers and other interested parties are welcome to contact the author for more information.

Mahesh Hemantha was a Sri Lankan cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman.
Hemantha made his first-class debut during the Saravanamuttu Trophy competition of 1991-92, playing for Kalutara Physical Culture Centre. Hemantha's career began unsteadily, though in the last of his six matches for the team, in their only year of first-class cricket, he hit a career-best 163, which single-handedly accounted for nearly 70 percent of the total number of runs he scored in his entire first-class career - and the best first-class score for any Kalutara player.
While Kalutara did not enter first-class cricket the following season, Hemantha switched teams to play for Antonians Sports Club. Hemantha slotted into the lower order for most of the games he played for Antonians, he played his final three innings as an opener alongside team-mate Pathmanath Perera.

Horse Heaven is a ghost town in Jefferson County in the U.S. state of Oregon.

According to a letter written in 1946 by the Horse Heaven postmaster, Frank E. Lewis, the name for the settlement stemmed from herds of horses that thrived on the local grasses and drank from unfenced springs. Mary E. Finnall, the first postmaster, received the Horse Heaven mail twice a week from Ashwood. Homesteaders settled in the general vicinity, but most had moved away by 1946, when the post office closed. Horse Heaven Mountain and Horse Heaven Creek take their name from the settlement.
After two men discovered cinnabar, an ore of mercury, in the area in 1933, mercury production began there in 1934. Two years later, Horse Heaven Mines, a subsidiary of Sun Oil Company, took over and continued mining until 1944, when fire destroyed the ore-processing furnace, power plant, and other structures. The mine closed in 1945 but re-opened in 1955 with a new furnace. Much of the mine collapsed between then and 1958, when the mine closed again.[tpl]cite web|title=Record of Decision: Recommended Remedial Action for Horse Heaven Mine, Sunoco|publisher=Oregon Department of Environmental Quality|url=http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/cu/er/HorseHeaven/RecordOfDecision.PDF|format=PDF|year=2005|accessdate=August 1, 2011[/tpl]

Chengjiang County (Chinese: officially 澂江县; often spelled 澄江县; pinyin: Chéngjiāng Xiàn; earlier Tchinkiang) is located in Yuxi, Yunnan Province, China, just north of Fuxian Lake.
Within evolutionary biology, and especially paleontology, Chengjiang County is noted for soft-tissue fossil finds, of the Maotianshan Shales, dated to between 525 and 520 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion, which "are as spectacular as the Burgess Shale fauna, and significantly older".[tpl]cite book | last = Sterelny| first = Kim| authorlink = Kim Sterelny | title= Dawkins Vs Gould: Survival of the Fittest |year=2007 | publisher=Icon Books| location = Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=1-84046-780-0 | page=116 [/tpl] Also ISBN 978-1-84046-780-2 These fossils are considered one of the most important fossil finds of the 20th Century.

The fossils were first discovered by Hou Xian-guang, who is a Professor at Yunnan University, Kunming, where he is Director of the Research Center for Chengjiang Biota. Previously he was a Professor at the Palaeontological Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing.
Chengjiang is an underdeveloped county having rich phosphate deposits that are found both above and below the formation holding the lagerstatte. They have been exploited in part through efforts that began at about the same time that Hou Xian-guang discovered the deposits that bear these exceptional fossils, with phosphate mining bringing in some 2/3 of the county's revenue in 2003. Efforts were made to close the region to mining in a bid to support the county's bid for listing as a World Heritage site, given the scientific significance of the fossils. A consequence of this was renewed mining efforts in the region, which threatened the fossil-bearing strata due to erosion, slumping of overburden, and simple destruction by the mining efforts. Chengjiang County faces the dilemma between calls for preservation of the treasure trove of early Cambrian fossils to which it is steward and the economic reliance it has on the phosphate industry, and the difficulty of finding a balance between exploitation and restoration of the land while this is still possible.

CATEGORIES: Romanian diplomats

Constantin Langa-Răşcanu was a Romanian diplomat. He was the head of the Romanian delegation at the Vienna meeting with the delegation of the Soviet Union headed by N. N. Krestinsky. 
The meeting had been convened after a preliminary discussion between Georgy Chicherin, People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs and Constantin Diamandy minister plenipotentiary of Romania. During that meeting, Georgy Chicherin had suggested that the Soviet Union recognize the unification of Bessarabia and Romania on condition that the Romanians give up the claims to the Romanian national treasure and the Romanian Crown Jewels which had been evacuated to Moscow during World War I and had not been returned.   
The Vienna meeting took place in March–April 1924. Another point of contention was the Romanian national treasure . The auspices were not favorable, as just days before the meeting, the Soviets had created the Moldavian Autonomous Oblast on March 7, 1924, apparently to reinforce their claims on Bessarabia. Constantin Langa-Răşcanu's stated that the Romanian government wanted to separate the issues of Bessarabia and of the national treasure. Langa-Răşcanu also insisted that Romania was not willing to discuss its sovereignty over Bessarabia. Krestinsky countered that the Sfatul Ţării had no right to decide the fate of the province in 1918 and he suggested that the fate of the province be decided by plebiscite. On instructions from prime-minister Ion I. C. Brătianu, Constantin Langa-Răşcanu rejected the Soviet demands and the talks collapsed.
The main assignment of Constantin Langa-Răşcanu was serving as minister plenipotentiary of Romania to Greece, where we was involved in the negotiations for the Balkan Pact. He was recalled in 1936.

Revue des Études Arméniennes (in English: "Journal of Armenian Studies") is a peer-reviewed academic journal that publishes articles relating to Classical and medieval Armenian history, art history, philology, linguistics, and literature.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Revue des Études Arméniennes. Peeters Online Journals. Accessed October 7, 2008. The Revue was established in 1920 by Frédéric Macler and Antoine Meillet.[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] Mahé, Jean-Pierre. «Ռևյու դեզ էթյուդ Արմենիեն» des Études Arméniennes. Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1983, vol. ix, p. 649. Meillet himself wrote many of the articles during the formative years of the journal (1920-1933), which typically covered Armenian history, grammar, and folk tales. The Revue was not published from 1934 to 1963.
In 1964, thanks to the efforts of the Paris-based Armenian scholar Haïg Berbérian (1887-1978), the journal was revived. Berbérian was able to secure the financial backing of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation for the journal's publication, and the first volume of the "Nouvelle série" appeared under his editorship in 1964.Kouymjian, Dickran. "Preface" in In Memoriam: Haïg Berbérian, ed. Dickran Kouymjian. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1986, pp. xi-xii. Unlike during the first series, however, the publication of articles on the modern period of Armenian history was discontinued, and the journal has since limited its scope to the Early modern period (that is, until the 18th century).Revue des Études Arméniennes. Peeters Online Journals.
Up until 1933, articles were published in French, but when publication resumed articles were also published in English and German.Manuscripts submitted in other languages, such as Spanish, are also now accepted. The journal uses the Hübschmann-Meillet-Benveniste system in the transcription of Armenian words into Latin characters. In addition to scholarly articles, it also publishes book reviews.
The journal's former editors were Jacques Benveniste (nominally, 1964-1975), Georges Dumézil (1975-1980), and Sirarpie Der-Nersessian (1981-1989).

[[Spidercam]]

CATEGORIES: Film and video technology

The Spidercam is a system which enables film and television cameras to move both vertically and horizontally over a predetermined area, typically the playing field of a sporting event such as a cricket pitch, football field or a tennis court. The name "Spidercam" is a trademark. The Spidercam is very similar to the Skycam, which preceded it, having been invented in the United States in 1984.
The Spidercam operates with four motorized winches positioned at each corner at the base of the covered area, each of which controls a Kevlar cable connected to a gyro-stabilized camera-carrier, or dolly.  By controlling the winding and unwinding of the cables, the system allows the dolly to reach any position in the three-dimensional space.  The inputs of the Spidercam "pilot" are processed by software which forwards the commands to the winches via fiber optic cables.  Two of the Kevlar cables also have fiber optic cables woven into them to carry commands to the camera and the remote head, and bring the camera's high definition signal back to the control station. The remote head, which houses the camera, provides pan and tilt movement and includes the lens remote which controls focus, zoom and irising. A gyro sensor in the dolly stabilises the horizon. A specially trained Spidercam camera operator controls the camera.

Fun Fun Fun Fest (often abbreviated as "FFF" or "F3F") is an annual music and comedy festival held in Austin, Texas. The festival is the only genre based festival in the United States, featuring stages that focus specifically on hip-hop / electronica, indie rock, punk / metal, and comedy.
Started in 2006, the festival focuses on a combination of discovering emerging talent, putting together either rarely seen or anticipated reunion performances. Being based in Austin (The Live Music Capital of the World), FFF has the unique ability to work with new musicians that have yet to experience the national stage. The festival has a history of unearthing new artists that eventually end up in the mainstream music and festival markets.
Fun Fun Fun Fest is also known for its dedication to the unique Austin culture, featuring progressive street food from some of Austin's favorite eateries, an annual API poster show featuring work from artists all over the U.S., along with pop up vintage fashion shops and record stores. The Festival has also been known to have everything from a mechanical bull to a live wrestling ring featuring Sexy Sax Man on site.
Notable acts from the past include Public Enemy, Spoon, Weird Al Yankovich, Girl Talk, The Descendents, MGMT, Bad Religion, Danzig, Mastodon, The Dead Milkmen, Slick Rick, Pharcyde, Cat Power, The National, M83, Circle Jerks, Todd Barry, Reggie Watts, Henry Rollins, Neil Hamburger, GWAR, and the return of famed Detroit punkers, Death, and many more.
In 2011, Fun Fun Fun Fest was moved to Auditorium Shores - a much larger downtown park, a change from previous years in which the event was held at Waterloo Park. In addition, 2011 saw the addition of a third full day and FFF Nites, a set of free aftershows for ticket holders in downtown Austin music venues, featuring an additional 75+ artists. Additionally, Ryan Gosling  and Rooney Mara filmed a sequence for an upcoming Terrence Malick film on November 4, 2011, at the festival.
The 2012 festival took place November 2–4 at Auditorium Shores. The event made headlines by announcing the reunion of the hip hop group, Run–D.M.C. for their first show in a decade.

Swan House was built in 1928 for Edward and Emily Inman in Atlanta, Georgia. The Inmans had accumulated wealth from cotton brokerage and investments on transportation, banking and real estate.  After their house in Ansley Park burned in 1924, the Inmans commissioned the Atlanta architectural firm of Hentz, Reid and Adler to design a new house in on [tpl]convert|28|acre|m2[/tpl] in Buckhead, a northern Atlanta community. The new mansion's design was executed by Philip Trammell Shutze, combining Renaissance revival styles with a Classical approach on the main facade.

A recurring motif are sculpted or painted swans throughout the house and grounds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/atlanta/swa.htm|date=2008-10-07|work= Atlanta: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary|title= Swan House|publisher=National Park Service[/tpl]

[[Meyer hardness test]]
CATEGORIES: Hardness tests

The Meyer hardness test is a rarely used hardness test based upon projected area of an impression. This is a more fundamental measurement of hardness than other hardness tests which are based on the surface area of an indentation. The principle behind the test is that the mean pressure required to test the material is the measurement of the hardness of the material. The mean pressure is calculated by dividing the load by the projected area of the indentation. The result is called the Meyer hardness, which has units of megapascals (MPa).[tpl]Citation | title = Hardness Testing | url = http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&site=kts&NM=140 | accessdate = 2008-10-07[/tpl].
An advantage of the Meyer test is that it is less sensitive to the applied load, especially compared to the Brinell hardness test. For cold worked materials the Meyer hardness is relatively constant and independent of load, whereas for the Brinell hardness test it decreases with higher loads. For annealed materials the Meyer hardness increases continuously with load due to strain hardening.
Based on Meyer's law hardness values from this test can be converted into Brinell hardness values, and vice-versa.Tabor, p. 10.
The Meyer hardness test was devised by Prof. Eugene Meyer of the Materials Testing Laboratory at the Imperial School of Technology, Charlottenburg, Germany, circa 1908.E. Meyer, "Untersuchungen über Härteprüfung und Härte Brinell Methoden," Z. Ver. deut. Ing., 52 (1908). V.E. Lysaght, Indentation Hardness Testing, New York: Reinhold Publishing Corp., 1949, p 39-47.

CATEGORIES: 1919 births, Living people, Australian communists, Australian Jews, People from Marrickville

Eric Aarons (born 1919) is a member of the third of four generations of the Aarons family who played leading roles in the Communist Party of Australia (CPA). Although never a mass party like those in Italy, France or Indonesia, the CPA played many important roles in Australian political life, most notably in the Labour Movement – in which it had significant influence across a wide spectrum of trade unions – and in many social movements, anti-war and peace organisations and anti-racist activities.
Aarons  played an important role in the party’s work from the mid-1940s to the winding up of the party in the early 1990s. He rose to be in charge of party education, to be a leading theorist and author, a powerful advocate for de-Stalinisation of the CPA and was one of three people who jointly replaced his older brother, Laurie Aarons, as CPA National Secretary in 1976.

[[Nude beach]]

CATEGORIES: Nude beaches

A nude beach is a beach where users are legally at liberty to be nude. Sometimes the terms clothing-optional beach or free beach are used. Nude bathing is one of the most common forms of nudity in public.  As beaches are usually on public lands, any member of the public is entitled to use the facilities without membership in any movement or subscription to any philosophy. The use of the beach facilities is normally anonymous. Unlike a naturist resort or facility, there is normally no membership or vetting requirement for the use of a nude beach. The use of nude beach facilities is usually casual, not requiring pre-booking. Nude beaches may be official (legally sanctioned), unofficial (tolerated by residents and law enforcement), or illegal. However, nude beaches are relatively few and at some distance from cities, and access is at times more difficult than at a regular beach and the facilities at these beaches tend to be very basic.
A nude beach should not be confused with a topless beach (or top-free beach), where upper body clothing is not required for women or men, although a swimming costume covering the genital area is required for both men and women.
Nude beaches first became popular in the 1950s along the French coast[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.travelchannel.com/interests/best-beach-vacations/articles/nude-beaches | title=NUDE BEACHES DON'T BE SHY: TAKE EVERYTHING OFF! | publisher=Travel Channel | accessdate=December 23, 2011 | author=Mize, Melanie[/tpl] and have since spread around the world, though they are still few and far between. Some nude beaches are part of a larger nude area, such as the Cap d'Agde area. Most beaches in Denmark[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.naturistnet.org//main.php?page_id=532 | title=Naturism and free beaches in Denmark. | publisher=Scandinavian Naturist Federations | accessdate=December 23, 2011 | quote=it is possible and allowed to be naked at any public beach in Denmark with only two major exceptions: Holmsland Klit and Hennestrand.

In Germany there are clothes optional sunbathing areas in public parks, e.g., in Munich[tpl]Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = | date = | year = | url = http://www.ganz-muenchen.de/freizeitfitness/baden/fkk.html| accessdate = 2007-11-27[/tpl] and Berlin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/2008/07/08/active-naturists-in-berlin/ |title=Berlin |publisher=active naturists |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] Beaches in some holiday destinations, such as Crete, are also clothing-optional, except some central urban beaches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/crete/ |title=Crete |publisher=active naturists |date=2009-01-24 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] There are two centrally located clothes-optional beaches in Barcelona.[tpl]cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/barcelona/ |title=Barcelona |publisher=active naturists |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl]
Nude beaches tend to be separate or isolated physically from the non-nude bathing areas. In other instances people maintain a comfortable space between beach users. Signage is often used to warn unfamiliar beach users about the specially designated areas on the beach. This accommodates people who are not comfortable with nudity (see gymnophobia). This also accommodates beach users who do not like to be watched too much, especially by clothed individuals (see voyeurism).
On an officially sanctioned nude beach, beach goers of both sexes have an option to remove their clothing without fearing legal prosecution or official harassment.
Though free beaches developed separately from national naturist bodies, these bodies are taking an interest and helping to protect them legally, and through the publication of guidelines of acceptable behaviour.[tpl]Citation  | last =Boura  | first =Malcolm    | title = Campaigning  | journal =British Naturism  | volume =BN 172  | issue =  | page = 31  | date =Summer 2007  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | issn = 0264 0406[/tpl] In North America, the Free Beach Movement was the name of a group that was opposed to the direction of the official nudist organisation, the American Association for Nude Recreation, and set up the rival body The Naturist Society. Clothes free organizations and free beach associations, such as the Naturist Action Committee, lobby for the removal of laws which prohibit nude swimming and sunbathing or the increase in the number of nude beaches and sometimes to improve the amenities at nude beaches.

Kenneth Francis Gray, MBE (24 June 1938 – 18 November 1992), was an international rugby union player from Porirua, New Zealand. He represented New Zealand in 24 international games, playing lock and later prop forward. He could play on either side of a scrum. In 1970 he refused to tour South Africa in protest at its policy of apartheid and resigned from the game.
He was elected a Hutt County Councillor in 1971 and became a Porirua City Councillor in 1973 when the riding of the County he was the member for, joined Porirua City. Later he was elected to the Hutt Valley Energy Board and to The Wellington Regional Council where he continued to serve until his unexpected death of a heart attack in 1992 (his brother Jim Gray also died of a heart attack in 1999).
In the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours, Gray was awarded an MBE, for services to local body affairs.
In 1992 Gray was selected as the Labour candidate for Western Hutt parliamentary electorate in the 1993 election, but he died before the election.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10717477|title=Ken Gray - 'Hoodeyes' put best to the test|first=David|last=Leggat|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=1 August 2011[/tpl] This seat was held by National at the time.

Station 13 of the Minneapolis Fire Department is a fire station in the Ericsson neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The station, at 4201 Cedar Ave. S., was built in 1923 during a period when the city was growing rapidly.  Between 1919 and 1922, nearly 5,000 new homes had been built in Minneapolis, and city planners of that era were concerned about fire protection for buildings located near the city limits.  That era saw other construction projects such as Roosevelt High School, built in 1922; Standish Elementary School, built in 1920; and Roosevelt Community Library, built in 1925.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/hpc/landmarks/Cedar_Ave_4201_Fire_Station_13.asp|title=Fire Station #13|publisher=Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission|date=February 2007|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl]
The city wanted the station to blend into its surrounding residential area, so the building was designed in the American Craftsman bungalow style.  It had a low, horizontal roof and a front yard, which distinguished it from other fire stations that typically had two stories and prominent entries. It served as a fire station until 1979, when the Minneapolis Fire Department initiated a remodeling and expansion program.  It later held an emergency medical technician unit before being converted to offices.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Station 28 of the Minneapolis Fire Department is a fire station at 2724 West 43rd Street in the Linden Hills neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The station was built in 1914, during a time when the population of Minneapolis was growing rapidly.  The Linden Hills neighborhood was evolving from a remote lakeside community to a neighborhood fully integrated into the city.  This period of expansion also saw the construction of Lake Harriet Public School in 1898, city sewers in 1905, and Linden Hills Community Library in 1911.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/hpc/landmarks/43rd_St_W_2724_Fire_Station_28.asp|title=Fire Station #28|publisher=Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission|date=February 2007|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl]
The station was the second-to-last station originally built by the city, and it was the first to be designed solely for motorized equipment.  The earlier horse-drawn rigs required more space and time, as well as upkeep for the horses.  Motorized fire engines were less expensive and more efficient, and they were able to cover more territory with a decreased response time.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.  The building has since been converted to office space, while Station 28 is now housed in a building at 2810 West 50th Street.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/fire/station28.asp|title=Fire Station 28|publisher=Minneapolis Fire Department|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl]

France was the first country with which India entered into an agreement on nuclear energy following the waiver given by International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group enabling India to resume full civil nuclear cooperation with the international community. There is also a growing and wide-ranging cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, culture, science & technology and education.France has consistently supported India’s permanent membership of the UNSC.
Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and President Hollande met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Los Cabos on 19 June 2012. This was his first meeting with the French President.
There has been a regular exchange of visits at the highest level - former French President Sarkozy undertook his second visit to India from 4–7 December 2010 (first visit on 25–26 January 2008) at the invitation of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister of India was the Guest of Honour at the 14 July Bastille Day Celebrations in 2009.

Lieutenant Junior Grade [tpl]nihongo|Seizō Yasunori|安則 盛三|Yasunori Seizō| ? - May 11, 1945[/tpl] was a Japanese student who joined the Imperial Japanese Navy, and on May 11, 1945 was ordered to fly a kamikaze mission during the Battle of Okinawa near the end of World War II. Kamikaze pilots were generally 18–20 years old, poorly trained, and flew poorly maintained aircraft.[tpl]r|wp[/tpl] As leader of the Navy's Kamikaze Corps 7th Showa Special Attack Squadron, he led a group of four young men to attack US Navy ships. Yasunori led a group of six planes which departed Kanoya Air Base between 0640 and 0653 on May 11, 1945. Yasunori dropped a 550-lb bomb and then crashed his A6M Zero into the aft portion of the flight deck of the [tpl]USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|6[/tpl], along with his wingman, Kiyoshi Ogawa. He and his wingman killed 393 Americans; the most devastating suicide attack directed at Americans before the September 11 attacks, and wounded an additional 264. Three-hundred fifty-two of the dead were buried at sea the next day. The bomb tore a hole in the port side of the ship and his plane crashed onto the flight deck. The ensuing explosion destroyed many of the planes on the deck. His plane dragged another plane overboard. His wingman, Kiyoshi Ogawa, crashed into the ship a few seconds later. A third plane crashed into the sea before reaching the ship. The fate of the remaining three planes is unknown.  His story is told in Danger's Hour, published by Simon & Schuster on Veteran's Day, 2008. [tpl]r|dayton[/tpl]

Arthur Davidson, Sr. (c. 1881–1950, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was one of the four original founders of Harley-Davidson.

One of Davidson's favorite pastimes was fishing in the Wisconsin wilderness, which inspired him to create a motorcycle that would, "take the hard work out of pedaling a bicycle". He was a story teller, salesman, and United States patriot. During World Wars I and II, Arthur and company diverted motorcycle production to support US troops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cannonsuperstore.com/harleywla.html|title=World War Two Harley Davidson WLA & WLC Motorcycles Available!|accessdate=6 April 2014[/tpl] This act was rewarded with returning troops ready, trained and willing to buy Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

[[Lee–Yang theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical mechanics theorems

In statistical mechanics, the Lee–Yang theorem states that if partition functions of certain  models in statistical field theory with ferromagnetic interactions are considered as functions of an external field, then all zeros 
are  purely imaginary (or on the unit circle after a change of variable). The first version was proved for the Ising model by [tpl]harvs|txt|first2=T. D.| last2=Lee|author2-link=T. D. Lee|first1=C. N. |last1=Yang|author1-link=C. N. Yang|year=1952[/tpl] [tpl]harv|Lee|Yang|1952[/tpl]. Their result was later extended to more general models by several people. 
[tpl]harvtxt|Simon|Griffiths|1973[/tpl] extended the Lee–Yang theorem to certain continuous probability distributions by approximating them by a superposition of Ising models. [tpl]harvtxt|Newman|1974[/tpl] gave a general theorem stating roughly that the Lee–Yang theorem holds for a ferromagnetic interaction provided it holds for zero interaction. [tpl]harvtxt|Lieb|Sokal|1981[/tpl] generalized Newman's result from measures on R to measures on higher-dimensional Euclidean space.
There has been some speculation about a relationship between the Lee–Yang theorem and the Riemann hypothesis about the Riemann zeta function; see [tpl]harv|Knauf|1999[/tpl].

[[Iran–Saudi Arabia relations]]

CATEGORIES: Iran–Saudi Arabia relations, Bilateral relations of Iran, Bilateral relations of Saudi Arabia, Shia–Sunni relations

Saudi–Iran Arabian relations refers to the bilateral relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia-Iran relations have been mixed throughout its history. Both Saudi Arabia and Iran have aspiration for Islamic leadership and both countries possess different vision of regional order. Iran, which after the Islamic Revolution strictly followed an anti-US policy, always deemed Saudi Arabia as an agent of the US in the Persian Gulf region that speaks for the US interests. Saudi Arabia's concerns about Iran on the other side are mainly associated to its plans of expanding influence to other parts of the Persian Gulf region, notably in post-Saddam Iraq, and the quest to build its own nuclear program.Frederic Wehrey et al, "Saudi-Iranian Relations Since the Fall of Saddam: Rivalry, Cooperation and Implication for US Policy" RAND, national Security Research Division, 2009.
The difference of political ideologies and governance also divided both countries. For Iran, it is said that there is no place for monarchical regimes in Islam as is seen in Saudi Arabia and also in some other Arab countries, which legitimizes the authority of Iranian clerical elites. Energy is a third source of  tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Whereas Saudi Arabia, in contrast to Iran with its smaller oil reserves and larger population, can afford and is in a position to take a long-term view of the global oil market and has incentive to moderate prices, on the other hand Iran is compelled to focus on high prices in the short term.

The McGill Redmen are the men's athletic teams that represent McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The women's teams are known as the McGill Martlets.
The name Redmen was first published in 1929 as "Red Men" and was used to describe the red uniforms worn by McGill sports teams. Research done by McGill historian Dr. Stanley Frost indicated that the name Redmen derived from ancient times, when Celts were known as the "Red Men" because of their red hair... "our own Red Men were no doubt Celts in honour of James McGill's Scottish descent," notes Frost.

The offensive operation was conducted by the forces of the 1st Ukrainian Front commanded by General of Army Nikolai Vatutin during World War II, from 24 December  through to 14 January 1944. 
The task was to defeat the opposing German 4th Panzer Army of Army Group South and advance to the Southern Bug river while preventing new attempts by the enemy to recapture Kiev. After an opening  attack across a 300 kilometer front, Soviet troops advanced from 80 to 200 km and nearly liberated all of the Kiev and Zhitomir regions, along with the regions of the Vinnytsa and Rivne Oblasts. The 1st Ukrainian Front gained a position north of the main German forces of Army Group South. The German forces retained the western shore of the Dnieper in the Kaniv region.
Manstein brought the 1st Panzer Army up to join the 4th Panzer Army in launching a series of counterattacks against the flanks of the extended Soviet forces. These counterattacks, conducted over the following three weeks, succeeded in creating a series of loosely-held pockets, and the Germans began to stabilize their front. The German counterattacks inflicted considerable losses in men and material upon the Red Army, and a cohesive defensive position eventually was restored. However the Soviet's held a great number of forces in reserve, and the success von Manstein achieved could not last. 
In addition to the Soviet formations and units, the 1st Czechoslovak Brigade also participated in the operation.
As a result of the Kiev Strategic Offensive operation late in 1943, troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front under Vatutin took a large bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnieper in the Kiev region that “overhung” the enemy group of the troops in the south-western Ukraine. In an attempt to reduce the bridgehead and to retake Kiev, German forces counter-attacked in the region south of Zhytomyr. The attempt to retake Kiev failed during the Kiev Strategic Defensive.

Jack Owens (born 3 August 1902, Broken Hill, New South Wales;Cornwall, Peter; Pride of the Bay: The Story of the Glenelg Football Club 1920-2003; p. 378. ISBN 097505617 died 26 September 1942, Adelaide, South Australia,“Jack Owens dead”; in The Barrier Miner, 26 September 1942) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Glenelg in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) during the 1920s and 1930s.
Originally from the West Broken Hill club, Owens was a prolific left footed full-forward who excelled despite playing much of his career in the league’s weakest team. He favored the screw punt when he lined up for goals and it was effective as he topped Glenelg’s goalkicking every year from 1924 to 1932 as well as for a tenth time in 1934. On three of those occasions he was the league's leading goal scorer, outright in 1927 and 1928 with 80 and 83 goals respectively while he tied for the mantle in 1932 with Ken Farmer on 102 goals.
Towards the end of his career Glenelg began to improve and in 1934 he captained the club to their inaugural SANFL premiership. He was also South Australian captain for interstate matches in 1933 and 1934. In all he appeared for his state team on nine occasions and kicked 26 goals. At the age of 32, however, Owens showed he was on the decline so quickly in 1935 that he announced his retirement after just three games and eight goals.
In 2002 Owens was in the first group of players inducted into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame.

[[Thioglycollate broth]]
CATEGORIES: Microbiological media, Growth media

Thioglycollate broth is a multi-purpose, enriched, differential medium used primarily to determine the oxygen requirements of microorganisms. Sodium thioglycolate in the medium consumes oxygen and permits the growth of obligate anaerobes.http://ftp.ccccd.edu/dcain/CCCCD%20Micro/thioglycollatebroth.htm This, combined with the diffusion of oxygen from the top of the broth produces a range of oxygen concentrations in the media along its depth. The oxygen concentration at a given level is indicated by a redox sensitive dye like resazurine that turns pink in the presence of oxygen.
This allows the differentiation of obligate aerobes, obligate anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, microaerophiles, and aerotolerant organisms.  For example, obligately anaerobic Clostridium species will be seen growing only in the bottom of the test tube.
Thioglycollate broth is also used to recruit macrophages to the peritoneal cavity of mice when injected intraperitoneally.[tpl]cite journal |author1=Leijh PC| author2=van Zwet TL | author3=ter Kuile MN| author4=van Furth R| title=Effect of thioglycolate on phagocytic and microbicidal activities of peritoneal macrophages |journal=Infection and Immunity |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=448–452 |date=November 1984 |pmid= 6500699|pmc=261553 |doi=[/tpl] It recruits numerous macrophages, but does not activate them.

CATEGORIES: Educational institutions established in 1990, Roman Catholic universities and colleges in France

 
The Catholic Institute of Higher Studies (Institut Catholique d'Etudes Supérieures - ICES) is a small private university located in Vendée region of western France, just 25 minutes from the Atlantic coast.
The main goal of this institute is to achieve academic excellence through an enhancement of the Christian and human dimension in seven areas of study. Founded in 1989, ICES has pioneered a new concept in higher education,invented by the first Director, Hervé GROLLIER, that of the “University School” : halfway between the French Grande École and the traditional state university.
In 1990, under the authority of l'Université Catholique d'Angers, the Catholic Institute of Higher Studies (ICES) was opened in Roche-sur-Yon. After three years of collaboration, the Superior Council of the Catholic University of the West awarded ICES its academic independence in 1993. François Garnier, Bishop of Luçon, became the institutional head of the establishment with the responsibility of maintaining its ecclesiastical membership.
In France, diplomas in broad subject areas such as Biology, Law, History, Languages, etc. are mostly proposed in state-run universities. The prestigious Grandes Ecoles in France are elite schools that have very high standards, selective recruitment, specialized fields of study as well as small groups with individual support and counselling.
ICES proposes state diplomas in broad study areas with pedagogical and educational standards that resemble those of a Grande Ecole.
The school's mission is to create a spirit of cooperation between teaching staff and students in the acquisition of knowledge and to establish a personalised partnership with each individual student in order to help realise his or her professional aim. ICES’ 900 students follow classes, conferences and symposiums given by nationally and internationally renowned professors from France and abroad.
To study abroad in France, the Academic Programs proposed at the ICES are:
Law, History, Languages, French Literature & Classics, Biology & Life Sciences, Chemistry & Physics, Applied Mathematics & Computer Science, Political Science, International Relations & International Careers.

He studied sculpture and painting at Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in 1952 and architecture at École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Belgium (1956).[tpl]cite news|title=Actress Loren among Japan art prize winners|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google News|date=14 September 2010|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jYtokv3mES2DA_84SZZPFQaJuRKg|accessdate=14 September 2010[/tpl] He is best known for his "paintings of light" that merge art, space and architecture to transcend the confines of painting.   In 1956 Castellani returned to Italy and met artists like Lucio Fontana and Piero Manzoni who were pushing Italian avant-garde art.
His original approach is considered fundamental for the art history of the 20th century, not only in Italy, but also on the international scene; In particular,
Castellani influenced Donald Judd, who saw him as the father of minimalism.
Castellani has exhibited at the most renowned institutions in the world including the MoMA and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York;
Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels and he has represented Italy at the Venice Biennale.
He has had retrospective exhibitions at Pushkin Museum, Moscow, Russia; Kettle's Yard in Cambridge; the Miuccia Prada in Milan; The Modern and Contemporary Civic Gallery in Latina in Trento; and Palazzo Fabroni in Pistoia. Castellani was the 2010 recipient of the Praemium Imperiale for Painting, the first Italian artist ever to receive this honor.

The convection–diffusion equation is a combination of the diffusion and convection (advection) equations, and describes physical phenomena where particles, energy, or other physical quantities are transferred inside a physical system due to two processes: diffusion and convection. Depending on context, the same equation can be called the advection–diffusion equation, drift–diffusion equation, Smoluchowski equation (after Marian Smoluchowski), or (generic) scalar transport equation.Computational Fluid Dynamics in Industrial Combustion by Baukal and Gershtein, p67, google books link.

[[John Wharlton Bunney]]
CATEGORIES: 19th-century English painters, Landscape artists, 1828 births, 1882 deaths

[[Image:Bunney.jpg|thumb|One of Bunney's Venetian paintings, La porta della Carta nel Palazzo Ducale, Venezia, 1879 
]]John Wharlton Bunney (20 June 1828 – 23 September 1882) was an English topographical and landscape artist of the nineteenth century.A. Wedderburn, Memoir of the Late John Wharlton Bunney, London, V. Brooks, Day, 1882.
His father was a merchant captain whom Bunney, as a boy, accompanied on several voyages around the world. Bunney demonstrated a strong talent for drawing and draftsmanship from an early age. The young Bunney became a follower of John Ruskin; he studied under Ruskin at the Working Men's College soon after its founding in 1854, and later worked as a clerk for Smith, Elder & Co., Ruskin's publisher. Bunney was able to give up his clerical job and make his living by his art and art teaching by 1859; Ruskin commissioned him to execute a series of drawings in Italy and Switzerland.Van Akin Burd, Christmas Story: John Ruskin's Venetian Letters of 1876–1877, Dover, DE, University of Delaware Press, 1990; p. 146.
Bunney married Elizabeth Fallon in 1863. The couple settled in Florence; they would have four children. Bunney worked for Ruskin's St. George's Company (later the Guild of St George) in northern Italy for the remainder of his life. In his career there, Bunney produced a noteworthy pictorial record of Italy in his era. Ruskin said that Bunney's work was "so faithful and careful as almost to enable the spectator to imagine himself on the spot." Bunney was a friend of many of the Pre-Raphaelites, especially William Holman Hunt.
From 1870 on, Bunney lived and painted in Venice. In 1876 Ruskin commissioned Bunney to paint a picture that included the entire western facade of St. Mark's Basilica; Bunney worked on this project through "six hundred early-morning sessions"John Hayman, John Ruskin in Switzerland, Waterloo, ON, Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1990;  p. 10. spaced over six years. (Ruskin was campaigning to prevent a renovation of the west front of St. Mark's, and the painting was part of this effort.) One day during this period, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, no admirer of Ruskin (Whistler had bankrupted himself in an 1878 libel suit against Ruskin), reportedly sneaked up behind Bunney as Bunney worked, to stick a note to his back. The note read, "I am totally blind." Bunney, absorbed in his work, remained oblivious to Whistler's prank.Christopher Wood, Victorian Painting, Boston, Little, Brown & Co., 1999; p. 138. The painting now hangs in the Ruskin Gallery in the Millennium Galleries in Sheffield.
After Bunney's death in 1882, Ruskin started a memorial fund to benefit his widow and children.

[[Asynchronous method invocation]]
CATEGORIES: Threads (computing), Software design patterns

In (multithreaded) object-oriented programming, asynchronous method invocation (AMI), also known as asynchronous method calls or asynchronous pattern is a design pattern for asynchronous invocation of potentially long-running methods of an object.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zeroc.com/doc/Ice-3.2.1/manual/Async.34.2.html#71139 |title=Asynchronous Method Invocation |accessdate= 22 November 2008 |work=Distributed Programming with Ice |publisher=ZeroC, Inc.[/tpl]
It is equivalent to the IOU pattern described in 1996 by Allan Vermeulen.[tpl]cite journal |last=Vermeulen |first=Allan  |date=June 1996 |title=An Asynchronous Design Pattern |journal=Dr. Dobb's Journal |url=http://www.ddj.com/184409898 |accessdate=22 November 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Nash |first=Trey |title=Accelerated C# 2008 | year=2007 |publisher=Apress |isbn=978-1-59059-873-3 |chapter=Threading in C# [/tpl]
The event-based asynchronous pattern in .NET Framework and the [tpl]Javadoc:SE|package=java.util.concurrent|java/util/concurrent|FutureTask[/tpl] class in Java use events to solve the same problem. This pattern is a variant of AMI whose implementation carries more overhead, but it is useful for objects representing software components.
In most programming languages a called method is executed synchronously, i.e. in the thread of execution from which it is invoked. If the method needs a long time to completion, e.g. because it is loading data over the internet, the calling thread is blocked until the method has finished. When this is not desired, it is possible to start a "worker thread" and invoke the method from there. In most programming environments this requires many lines of code, especially if care is taken to avoid the overhead that may be caused by creating many threads. AMI solves this problem in that it augments a potentially long-running ("synchronous") object method with an "asynchronous" variant that returns immediately, along with additional methods that make it easy to receive notification of completion, or to wait for completion at a later time.
One common use of AMI is in the active object design pattern. Alternatives are synchronous method invocation and future objects.[ref]
</ref>
An example for an application that may make use of AMI is a web browser that needs to display a web page even before all images are loaded.

Richard Nykke (Nix; c. 1447–1535) was bishop of Norwich, the last Roman Catholic to hold the post before the Henrician reform. Described as "ultra-conservative", but also "much-respected",Diarmaid MacCulloch, Thomas Cranmer (1996), p. 126. he maintained an independent line and was embroiled in conflict until blind and in his last years. He is often called the last Catholic bishop of the diocese, but that title is also claimed by John Hopton, bishop under Mary of England.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11121a.htm Norwich at this time was the second-largest conurbation in England, after London.
A hunter of heresy who came by his bishopric under Pope Alexander VI, he was a natural target for Protestant propaganda, and stories about him are sometimes poorly founded. One of the best known is that he said that potential heretics "savoured of the frying pan".

The Leonard W. Stanley House is a historic house at 23–25 Taylor Street in Waltham, Massachusetts.  The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1855-56 by Leonard Stanley, a policeman.  It is one of the oldest houses on the South Side of Waltham, which the city purchased from Newton in 1849, and is an unusual local example of transitional Federal/Italianate styling.  Its basic massing is somewhat typically Federalist, with a five bay facade and side gable roof.  However, it has deep eaves and segmented-arch attic windows, typical Italianate features.  The main block was extended with ells in the 1870s and 1880s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=WLT.650|title=NRHP nomination for Leonard W.

The valley is at risk of flooding between Cross Inn and Pontyclun and is liable to overflow its northern bank along its one and a half mile (2.5 km) length downstream from the main A4119 (Tonypandy to Cardiff Bay ([tpl]lang-cy|Bae Caerdydd[/tpl])) road at Talbot Green, ([tpl]lang-cy|Tonysguboriau[/tpl]) to Pontyclun, providing a wetland wildlife habitat.
There are many archeological sites close to the course of the river, from the Bronze Age tumuli on The Garth and an Iron Age hill fort at Rhiwsaeson, to the more recent industrial archeology of the coal mines.

CATEGORIES: The Muppets characters, Lists of Disney characters

The Muppets (a combination of marionette and puppet) are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson and now owned by The Walt Disney Company (namely at their entertainment branch called The Muppets Studio). The characters became a household name after their appearance in the children's television program Sesame Street. Henson was initially reluctant to become involved with Sesame Street because he feared being pigeon-holed as a children's performer, but agreed to work on the show to further his social goals. The first Muppet characters appeared as early as 1955, in Sam and Friends, a Washington, D.C.-based show that was on the air for six years. Kermit the Frog was one of the show's regulars, and thus was one of Henson's first Muppet creations.
By the early 1970s, Henson began to think seriously about the possibility of a network series for adults featuring the Muppets. The characters appeared on the comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live (namely The Land of Gorch segments) in 1975, and by 1976, The Muppet Show (which was produced in London) began to air in syndication. Jim Henson and his associates created additional characters for subsequent projects which included television shows, movies, commercials, and programs for the Internet.

Wilhelm Adolf Baehrens (3 September 1885 – 23 January 1929) was a German classical scholar.
The son of professor Emil Baehrens (1848–1888), Wilhelm Baehrens was born in Groningen. After visiting the local gymnasium he stepped in his early deceased father's footsteps by studying philology and papyrology at the University of Groningen. He also stayed few semesters at Halle, Göttingen and Berlin. In 1910 Baehrens received his doctor's degree at Groningen with his dissertation Panegyricorum latinorum editionis novae praefatio maior accedit Plinii panegyricus. For two years he acted as assistant schoolmaster at the Groningen gymnasium, until in 1912 he published his Beiträge zur lateinischen Syntax. In 1913 the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities entrusted him with the publication of the Latin homilies by Origen. The next three years Baehrens travelled to Italy, France and Germany collating manuscripts. The University of Groningen therefore awarded him venia legendi in 1915 and in 1916 Baehrens was appointed ordinary professor at the University of Ghent by the German occupation government in Belgium.
After the loss of Germany in World War I and the termination of the German occupation of Belgium, Baehrens was expelled from Ghent as a collaborator in 1919. Because of the Halle professor Georg Wissowa, he habilitated there in May 1919 and was appointed professor-extraordinary in 1920. In 1922 he was appointed ordinary professor at the University of Göttingen, where he worked until his death in 1929. His edition of the works of Origen was published from 1920 to 1925; another edition of Fulgentius' works was not completed.

MS Genève is the oldest paddle ship of Lake Geneva. 
Genève was built in 1896 by Sulzer for the Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman. She was launched for the Swiss national exhibition in Geneva.
Genève was the theater of the death of Elisabeth of Bavaria on 10 September 1898. The wounded Empress, who had been stabbed, boarded the ship, where her condition was seen to be life-threatening, and Genève turned around to return her to the Hôtel Beau-Rivage, where she died shortly afterwards.
On 3 May 1928, near Pully, Genève collided with the Rhône. The left anchor of Genève became entangled into the rigging of the Rhône, breaking her bowsprit and her figurehead, and snapping the top of the fore-mast. A passenger was killed by a falling piece of the fore-mast.
In 1934, Genève went under a refit, where her steam machinery was replaced with diesel engines. She was the first CGN ship to be converted to diesel.
In 1973, Genève was taken out of commission and sold for scrap. The next year, she was purchased by an "Association pour le Bateau Genève" for 75 000 CHF, and moored at Eaux-Vives dock. She is now unserviceable, but still afloat.
The name Genève was taken by a CGN swift boat on 31 October 2007.

Ozark Air Lines Flight 650 was a regularly scheduled flight from Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux Falls Regional Airport in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. While landing on runway 3 in a snow storm on December 20, 1983, it struck a snow plow on the runway. The impact ripped the right wing from the plane destroying the snow plow and killing its driver. The leaking fuel from the wing briefly created a fireball that engulfed the airplane. The plane spun through 180° before coming to rest off the runway to the left of the center line. Passenger evacuation was initiated through the front two doors. No passengers were injured in the evacuation but two flight attendants suffered minor injuries.
The resulting NTSB investigation determined that the snow removal operations were controlled from the tower. The snow plow, call sign Sweeper 7, had been routinely directed to exit the runway to accommodate arrivals and departures. When flight 650 was handed off from approach control to the tower it did not initiate contact with the tower. The tower controller eventually contacted the flight and cleared it to land. No communications had been made between the tower and Sweeper 7 after flight 650 was handed off to the tower controller. Neither the approach or tower controller had advised flight 650 that snow removal operations were in progress. The hourly ATIS broadcast advised that blowing snow conditions were present. The crew was not concerned on landing that snow was observed blowing on the runway. Shortly after touchdown when they entered the snow cloud the plane struck the snow plow. The board concluded the snow removal operations were inadequately supervised by the tower.
The aircraft involved in the accident was eventually returned to service with a replacement right wing salvaged from Air Canada Flight 797 that had been destroyed by fire after an emergency landing at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport earlier that year. The aircraft was acquired by Republic Airlines and flew with Northwest Airlines after their merger until it was retired in 2006.

Zollie Coffer Steakley, Jr. (August 29, 1908 – March 24, 1992) was Secretary of State of Texas from 1957 to 1962 and a Justice of the Texas Supreme Court from 1962 to 1981.
Steakley was born in Rotan, Texas, near Sweetwater. He graduated as valedictorian from DeLeon High School in 1926, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Simmons University (now Hardin-Simmons University) in Abilene in 1929. He excelled as a baseball player, and after college he declined a professional baseball contract to attend law school. He earned an LL.B. from The University of Texas School of Law in 1932.
After finishing law school, Steakley practiced law in Sweetwater from 1932 to 1939 and also assisted his father, Zollie Steakley, Sr., in his Chevrolet dealership. Steakley married Leonna Ruth Butler, a Sweetwater native, in 1939 and moved with his new bride to Austin where he was assistant attorney general under Gerald Mann for the next three years. He joined the U.S. Navy during World War II, serving from 1942 to 1945 in naval intelligence and earning the rank of lieutenant commander.
Following the war, Steakley returned to Austin and served as assistant attorney general under Grover Sellers from 1945 to 1946. He then went into law practice in Austin from 1946 to 1957, when Gov. Price Daniel appointed him secretary of state.
Steakley joined the Texas Supreme Court in 1961 when Gov. Daniel appointed him an associate justice to fill the vacancy created when Robert Calvert became chief justice. Steakley was subsequently elected to the position in November 1962 and reelected in 1968 and 1974. He retired from the court in January 1981. During his tenure he authored an estimated 200 major opinions and was an authority in many areas of law.
Following his retirement from the bench Steakley served as special assistant to attorney general Mark White. When White was elected governor, Steakley became a special assistant in the governor's office of general counsel. He also assisted attorneys general Jim Mattox and Dan Morales. He served on the board of trustees of Hardin-Simmons University, his alma mater, for eighteen years and taught a radio Bible class for forty-two years that reached a large audience in central and east Texas. Steakley died in Austin at the age of eighty-three.

[[Colle Caruno]]
CATEGORIES: Frazioni of the Province of Teramo, Teramo

Colle Caruno is a frazione (outlying area) of the Commune of Teramo in the Abruzzo Region of Italy. It is located about four miles from the communal capital. In times past the village has been referred to in documents as Colacaruni or  Collecaruni.   These names likely derive from a certain Cola (Niccola) Caruni, buried in a graveyard in Teramo. 
Colle Caruno falls under the bishopric of Teramo. In 1123 one large feud existed made up of Colle Caruno along with Gesso (today Villa Gesso), Castagneto, and Pozo Rotari (likely today's Poggio Rattieri). It was administered by the Totoneschi family.
Historians pint to the existence of the Chiesa di San Giacaomo (Church of Saint James) as far back as 1271. In 1804 the area in and around Colle Coruno was reported to have 19 inhabitants falling under the jurisdiction of Teramo, 26 inhabitants under the jurisdiction of Montorio al Vomano, and 27 inhabitants under the jurisdiction of Bisegno. During the Napoleonic era in the early 18900's the village was included in what was then referred to as the Circondario di Teramo (Teramo Provincial Holdings). In 1813 the area, along with Forcella and Magnanella con Gesso, was officially placed within the commune of Teramo.

[[Taurisci]]

CATEGORIES: Gauls, Celtic tribes of Illyria, Ancient history of Slovenia

The Taurisci were a federation of Gallic tribes who dwelt in today's northern Slovenia (Carniola) before the coming of the Romans (c. 200 BC)[tpl]Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Krain[/tpl]  According to Pliny the Elder, they are the same people known as the Norici.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia.[tpl]Cite book| title = Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind | author = James Cowles Prichard | page = 92 | publisher = Houlston & Stoneman | year = 1841 [/tpl] The denotation probably stems from Celtic taur meaning "mountain", as in Tauern, and therefore may also refer to highlanders in general.
Affiliated with the Celto-Ligurian Taurini, the Taurisci settled on the upper Sava river after their defeat at the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC. In the wake of the Boii they migrated to northern Italia and the Adriatic coast. The Greek chronicler Polybius (ca. 203–120 BC) mentioned Tauriscian gold mining in the area of Aquileia. With the troops of the Roman Republic they were defeated by invading Germanic Cimbri and Teutons at the Battle of Noreia in 112 BC.
The identity of Taurisci and Norici has not yet been conclusively established: According to historian Géza Alföldy, the Norici were one tribe of the larger highlandic Taurisci federation, while the Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde defines the Norici as Celts settling in the Regnum Noricum in present-day Carinthia with the Taurisci as their southeastern neighbours. Other people settling in the region were the Pannonians in the south-east of Carniola, in the south-west lived the Iapydes, an Illyrian tribe, and the Carni, a Venetic tribe.

A regional election took place on 14–15 December 2008 in Abruzzo, due to the early resignation (the last election was held in 2005) of President Ottaviano Del Turco, after his indictment for alleged corruption.http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/luglio/15/Tangenti_per_milioni_Del_Turco_co_9_080715096.shtmlhttp://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/luglio/18/Del_Turco_lascia_guardate_miei_co_9_080718101.shtml The election was to take place on 30 November–1 December but was postponed because of legal issues over the ammission of the list of For the Common Good.http://www.agi.it/ultime-notizie-page/200811251228-pol-rom1077-art.html
The candidate of The People of Freedom (PdL) was Gianni Chiodi, a former mayor of Teramo.http://www.agi.it/l-aquila/notizie/200810161229-pol-raq0029-art.html The PdL rejected any alliance with the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC) and The Right in order to strengthen its goal of becoming a majority force free from the blackmails of small "old politics" parties.http://www.agi.it/l-aquila/notizie/200810171340-pol-raq0027-art.html
On the centre-left, local and national leaders of Democratic Party (PD) tried to produce a joint candidate with Italy of Values (IdV) and UDC, but IdV said that an alliance with the PD was possible only if the PD would have supported their own candidate, Carlo Constantini. IdV was even tempted by running a solitary campaign: Abruzzo was in fact a stronghold for the party, whose leader Antonio Di Pietro comes from neighbouring Molise. However, in late October, the PD agreed to support Costantini at the head of a large centre-left coalition, comprising also the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), the Party of Italian Communists (PdCI), the Federation of the Greens and the Socialist Party (PS).http://www.asca.it/moddettnews.php?idnews=786879&canale=ORA&articolo=ABRUZZO/ELEZIONI:%20IL%20CENTROSINISTRA%20PUNTA%20TUTTO%20SU%20COSTANTINI%20(IDV)
The PD tried to woo also the UDC in the centre-left coalition, but the UDC refused any alliance with populist IdV and decided to run its own candidate, Rodolfo De Laurentiis.http://www.repubblica.it/ultimora/24ore/ABRUZZO-CESA-IDV-E-PD-OK-MA-CON-NOSTRO-CANDIDATO/news-dettaglio/3361495 Teodoro Buontempo was the candidate of The Right.http://www.iltempo.it/politica/2012/12/14/e-la-destra-candida-buontempo-1.258077

The Cizek Model Onehttp://www.classicspeakerpages.net/IP.Board/index.php?showtopic=3170 http://www.classicspeakerpages.net/IP.Board/uploads/post-8-1150017207.jpg was the first HIFI product of CIZEK Audio System, a two-way bookshelf loudspeaker system which gave a certain notoriety to Roy Cizek, founder of the company. 
This product was important because it was the first loudspeaker system which, due to its particular crossover, showed a flat impedance curve (except for the resonance peak) with a consequent easier work for the amplifier and linear frequency response.
Another peculiarity of the Cizek One was a switch that permitted selection of the Q factor of the bass frequencies; thus, the listener could choose a more or less controlled bass depending on the kind of music or ambient acoustic characteristics.http://www.classicspeakerpages.net/IP.Board/index.php?showtopic=3122 The Cizek Model One became the most successful product of the Company since 1976, first year of production.

[[Tommy Battle]]
CATEGORIES: 1955 births, Alabama city council members, Living people, Mayors of Huntsville, Alabama, Alabama Republicans

Thomas M. "Tommy" Battle, Jr. (born December 3, 1955) is the mayor of Huntsville, Alabama. His term began November 3, 2008.
Battle served one term on the Huntsville City Council from 1984-1988. He made an unsuccessful run for mayor in 1988.  Battle moved to Huntsville in 1980 to operate Britling's Buffet, which he sold in 1989. Battle owns or is managing partner in several firms in the retail and real estate sectors.  He is married to Eula Battle and has one adult son, Drew.  Battle is a graduate of the University of Alabama, from which he holds a B.S. degree in business.
Battle announced his candidacy against incumbent Mayor Loretta Spencer on March 26, 2008. In his campaign, he sharply attacked Spencer on several issues.  Among these were cost overruns and delays on a city jail constructed in Spencer's term; the city's controversial involvement in the relocation of a downtown rescue mission into a residential neighborhood; and what Battle claimed was inequitable treatment of some city neighborhoods, particularly minority areas. Prior to the first round of voting, Spencer was endorsed by The Huntsville Times. The Committee of 100, a prominent group of business leaders, issued a joint endorsement of Battle and Spencer.
In the municipal election on August 26, 2008, Spencer led Battle by 14,871 votes to 14,486.  However, two minor candidates received 673 votes, preventing Spencer from attaining a majority, forcing a runoff with Battle. During the runoff campaign, Battle sharpened his attacks on Spencer, and pointed to a "bridge to nowhere".  The bridge in question was constructed by the city, and ended at an undeveloped empty lot.  Spencer claimed the lot was expected to be developed at some point in the future. In the runoff, on October 7, 2008, Battle decisively defeated Spencer, by a vote of 21,123 votes or 56 percent for Battle, to 16,821 or 44 percent for Spencer.
In August 2012, Battle was elected to a second four-year term with 80.7% of the vote, defeating Jackie Reed (4.1%) and former mayor Loretta Spencer (15.2%).

[[Gary Crowley]]

CATEGORIES: English radio DJs, English music journalists, Living people, 1961 births

Gary Crowley (born 8 October 1961) is an English broadcaster and DJ.Burrell, Ian (2009) "Gary Crowley - How 'the youngest voice on radio' stays fresh", The Independent, 9 November 2009, retrieved 2010-11-02
When he was at school (Rutherford School, Penfold Street, Marylebone, London) in the late Seventies Crowley started a punk fanzine titled The Modern World, interviewing some of the most important bands of the day including the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Jam.
After leaving school he took up a junior position at the Decca record label. A short time later[tpl]when|date=August 2010[/tpl] he moved jobs to take over from Danny Baker as the telephone receptionist for the NME at their offices in Carnaby Street. At the time the weekly music paper was at the very centre of the punk explosion under the editorship of Neil Spencer and featured writers such as Julie Burchill, Tony Parsons and Nick Kent.
Crowley's next employment was with Clive Banks' independent plugging and publishing company and through connections there he was offered a job as a DJ on London's independent commercial station Capital Radio. At the age of 19 he became UK radio's youngest DJ.
TV presenting soon followed, with a Saturday morning children's show on ITV called Fun Factory and  as the presenter for the Runaround spin-off Poparound which ran in 1985 and 1986.
His TV career continued through the Nineties with the popular 'post-pub' music show The Beat ran on ITV from 1991–94 and in 2008 Gary Crowley presented on Rockworld TV.
Crowley's DJ broadcasting career began with his Capital Radio break and continued with an influential show called Magic Box on BBC Radio London.
In 1997 Crowley left what was then Greater London Radio to join up as the star presenter on London's first indie station XFM, the product of a team including NME journalist Steve Lamacq, programme controller Sammy Jacobs, record industry mogul Chris Parry and also featured Ricky Gervais as "head of speech".
XFM's launch date was set for  1 September 1997, with Crowley the first deejay to broadcast on the station. The day before launch, Diana, Princess of Wales died. The broadcast test tape was discontinued and XFM’s management considered delaying the launch. But a week of promotional live events meant that financially it had to go ahead as planned.
So it was that at midday 1 September 1997 Gary Crowley opened a new radio station with the words "Welcome to XFM, broadcasting on 104.9. We find ourselves starting a radio station today in circumstances we wouldn’t have wished, following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. As a mark of respect to someone we saw as someone going her own way… we wish to dedicate the activities of our launch day to her memory."
Crowley continued to present a mid-morning show until his old employers (and XFM rival) Capital Radio bought the station. He was offered an overnight "graveyard shift" show and decided to quit and return to the BBC, on what was now BBC London 94.9, where he continues to broadcast a two hour weekly show on Saturday evenings. In addition, Gary can often be found on BBC 6music filling in for other presenters.
