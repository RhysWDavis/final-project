The [[meteor]]s from this shower are slow moving, can be seen in December and usually peak around December 13–14, with the date of highest intensity being the morning of December 14. The shower is thought to be intensifying every year and recent showers have seen 120–160 meteors per hour under optimal conditions, generally around 02:00 to 03:00 local time. Geminids were first observed in 1862,<ref name="Kronk"/> much more recently than other showers such as the [[Perseids]] (36 AD) and [[Leonids]] (902 AD).

[[Meteor shower]]

CATEGORIES: Meteor showers, Astronomical events

A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's surface. Intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which may produce greater than 1,000 meteors an hour.[tpl]cite book | last = Jenniskens | first = P. | year = 2006 | title = Meteor Showers and their Parent Comets | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-85349-1 [/tpl]

[[Western text-type]]

CATEGORIES: Bible versions and translations, New Testament text-types, Biblical criticism

The Western text-type is one of several text-types used in textual criticism to describe and group the textual character of Greek New Testament manuscripts. It is the term given to the predominant form of the New Testament text witnessed in the Old Latin and Peshitta translations from the Greek; and also in quotations from certain 2nd and 3rd-century Christian writers, including Cyprian, Tertullian and Irenaeus. The Western text had a large number of characteristic features, which appeared in text of the Gospels, Book of Acts, and in Pauline epistles. The Catholic epistles and the Book of Revelation probably did not have a Western form of text. It was named "Western" by Semmler (1725–1791), having originated in early centers of Christianity in the Western Roman Empire.

[[List of towns and cities in Norway]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of cities by country, Cities and towns in Norway, Lists of cities in Scandinavia, Norway geography-related lists

This is a list of towns and cities in Norway.
The Norwegian word for town or city is by. Cities were formerly categorized as kjøpstad (market town) or ladested (small seaport),[tpl]cite paper | author=Statistics Norway | title=About the statistics: Population changes in municipalities 1951-1999 | year=2003 | url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/02/folkendrhist_en/about.html[/tpl] each with special rights. The special trading rights for cities were abolished in 1857, and the classification was entirely rescinded in 1952 and replaced by the simple classification by.
From 1 January 1965 the focus was moved from the individual cities to their corresponding municipalities. Norwegian municipalities were classified as bykommune (urban municipality) or herredskommune (rural municipality). The distinction was rescinded by The Local Government Act of 1992. The municipalities were ordered by so-called municipality numbers, four-digit codes based on ISO 3166-2:NO which in 1946 were assigned to each municipality. Urban municipalities got a municipality number in which the third digit was a zero.
Between 1960 and 1965 many Norwegian municipalities were merged. For instance when the urban municipality Brevik merged with the urban municipality Porsgrunn and the rural municipality Eidanger, the new municipality was called Porsgrunn and retained its municipality number. As a result, Brevik was no longer considered an urban municipality/town. On another note, when the urban municipality Hønefoss was merged with the rural municipalities Hole, Norderhov, Tyristrand and Ådal to form the new municipality Ringerike, Ringerike retained the old municipality number of Hønefoss.[tpl]cite paper | author=Dag Jukvam / Statistics Norway | title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen | year=1999 | url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdfl[/tpl] The same thing happened to Egersund and Florø.
Before 1996, the city status was awarded by the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development. Now the issue is decided by each municipality council and is formally accepted by the state. Since 1997 a municipality must have a minimum of 5,000 inhabitants in order to declare city status for one of its settlements. In 1999 the municipality council of Bardu declared city status for Setermoen, only to be rejected because the municipality fell short of the population limit. One exception is Honningsvåg in Nordkapp, where the municipality actually has less than 5,000 inhabitants but declared city status before the limit was implemented by law in 1997.[tpl]cite paper | author=Kommunal Rapport| title=Byer i Norge | date=23 June 2005 | url=http://www.kommunal-rapport.no/index.db2?id=3725[/tpl]
Because of the new laws, Norway witnessed a rapid rise in the number of cities after 1996. A number of relatively small settlements are now called by, such as Brekstad with 1,828 inhabitants and Kolvereid with 1,448 inhabitants.Population count applies to the tettsted (urban settlement), which is a continuous built-up area with less than 50 metres between the houses. [tpl]cite paper | author=Statistics Norway | title=Urban settlements.

On another note, the laws of 1996 allowed some settlements which lost their city status in the 1960s to regain it.
Oslo, founded in 1000[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl], is the largest city and the capital of Norway.

Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (Andreas; 2 February 1882 (N.S.) – 3 December 1944) of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was the seventh child and fourth son of King George I of Greece and Olga Constantinovna of Russia. He was a grandson of Christian IX of Denmark and father of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
He began military training at an early age, and was commissioned as an officer in the Greek army. His command positions were real appointments rather than honorary, and he saw service in the Balkan Wars. In 1913, his father was assassinated and Andrew's elder brother, Constantine, became king. Dissatisfaction with his brother's neutrality policy during World War I led to his brother's abdication and most of the royal family, including Andrew, was exiled. On their return a few years later, Andrew saw service in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), but the war went badly for Greece, and Andrew was blamed, in part, for the loss of Greek territory. He was exiled for a second time in 1922, and spent most of the rest of his life in France.
By 1930, he was estranged from his wife, Princess Alice of Battenberg. His only son, Prince Philip, served in the British navy during World War II, while all four of his daughters were married to German royals, three of whom had Nazi connections. Separated from his wife and son by the effects of the war, Andrew died in Monte Carlo in 1944. He had seen neither of them since 1939.

[[Ahnentafel]]

CATEGORIES: Genealogy

An ahnentafel (German for "ancestor table"; [tpl]IPA-de|ˈʔaːnənˌtaːfəl|lang[/tpl]) or ahnenreihe ("ancestor series"; [tpl]IPA-de|ˈʔaːnənˌʁaɪə|lang[/tpl]) is a genealogical numbering system for listing a person's direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of ascent. The subject (proband) of the ahnentafel is listed as No. 1, the subject's father as No. 2 and the mother as No. 3, the paternal grandparents as No. 4 and No. 5 and the maternal grandparents as No. 6 and No. 7, and so on, back through the generations. Apart from No. 1, who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male, and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this schema, the number of any person's father is double the person's number, and a person's mother is double the person's number plus one. Using this knowledge of numeration, one can derive some basic information about individuals who are listed without additional research.
This construct displays a person's genealogy compactly, without the need for a diagram such as a family tree. It is particularly useful in situations where one may be restricted to presenting a genealogy in plain text, for example, in e-mails or newsgroup articles. In effect, an ahnentafel is a method for storing a binary tree in an array by listing the nodes (individuals) in level-order (in generation order).
The ahnentafel system of numeration is also known as: the Eytzinger Method, for Michaël Eytzinger, the Austrian-born historian who first published the principles of the system in 1590;Eytzinger, Michael, Thesaurus principum hac aetate in Europa viventium, quo progenitores eorum... simul ac fratres et sonores inde ab origine reconduntur... usque ad annum..., Cologne: G. Kempensem, 1590 (1591). Note: In commentaries, his surname may appear in variant forms, including: Aitsingeri, Aitsingero, Aitsingerum, Eyzingern. the Sosa Method, named for Jerónimo (Jerome) de Sosa, the Spanish genealogist who popularized the numbering system in his work Noticia de la gran casa de los marqueses de Villafranca in 1676;Jouniaux, Léo, Généalogie : pratique, méthode, recherche, Quercy: Seuil, 2006, pp. 44–45. and the Sosa–Stradonitz Method, for Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz, the genealogist and son of Friedrich August Kekulé, who published his interpretation of Sosa's method in his Ahnentafel-atlas in 1898.Kekulé von Stradonitz, Stephan, Ahnentafel-atlas. Ahnentafeln zu 32 Ahnen der Regenten Europas und ihrer Gemahlinnen, Berlin: J. A. Stargardt, 1898–1904. This volume contains 79 charts of the sovereigns of Europe and their wives.
"Ahnentafel" is a loan word from the German language, and its German equivalents are Ahnenreihe and Ahnenliste.  An ahnentafel list is sometimes called a "Kekulé" after Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz.

[[Water table]]
CATEGORIES: Aquifers, Geotechnical engineering, Hydrology, Hydrogeology, Irrigation, Water supply, Water and the environment

The water table is the surface where the water pressure head is equal to the atmospheric pressure (where gauge pressure = 0).  It may be conveniently visualized as the "surface" of the subsurface materials that are saturated with groundwater in a given vicinity. However, saturated conditions may extend above the water table as surface tension holds water in some pores below atmospheric pressure.[tpl]cite book |last1=Freeze |first1=R. Allan |first2=John A. |last2=Cherry |year=1979 |title=Groundwater |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice-Hall |oclc=252025686[/tpl][tpl]pn|date=February 2012[/tpl] Individual points on the water table are typically measured as the elevation that the water rises to in a well screened in the shallow groundwater. 
The groundwater may be from infiltrating precipitation or from groundwater flowing into the aquifer. In areas with sufficient precipitation, water infiltrates through pore spaces in the soil, passing through the unsaturated zone. At increasing depths water fills in more of the pore spaces in the soils, until the zone of saturation is reached. In permeable or porous materials, such as sands and well fractured bedrock, the water table forms a relatively horizontal plane. Below the water table, in the phreatic zone, permeable units that yield groundwater are called aquifers. The ability of the aquifer to store groundwater is dependent on the primary and secondary porosity and permeability of the rock or soil. In less permeable soils, such as tight bedrock formations and historic lakebed deposits, the water table may be more difficult to define.
The water table should not be confused with the water level in a deeper well. If a deeper aquifer has a lower permeable unit that confines the upward flow, then the water level in a well screened in this aquifer may rise to a level that is greater or less than the elevation of the actual water table. The elevation of the water in this deeper well is dependent upon the pressure in the deeper aquifer and is referred to as the potentiometric surface, not the water table.

[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]

Romance of the Three Kingdoms, attributed to Luo Guanzhong, is a historical novel set amidst the turbulent years near the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280 AD.
The story (part historical, part legend, and part myth) romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han Dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han Dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and army battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years. 
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.Roberts 1991, pg. 940 The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|title=(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations|author=Kim, Hyung-eun|publisher=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=2008-07-11|archiveurl=http://liveweb.archive.org/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|archivedate=2011-12-25|quote=The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is comparable to the Bible in East Asia.

Within a few years after Armstrong's death in 1986, the succeeding church administration modified the denomination's doctrines and teachings to be compatible with mainstream evangelical Christianity, while many members and ministers left and formed other churches that conformed to many, but not all, of Armstrong's teachings.

Ron Stander (born October 17, 1944 in Columbia, South Carolina) is a boxing referee and former professional boxer from Council Bluffs, Iowa, who was once a challenger for the heavyweight championship of the world.
Stander built up a 23-1-1 record, including a knockout win over future world title challenger, the hard-punching Earnie Shavers, and decisions over fringe contenders Jack O'Halloran, Manuel Ramos, and Thad Spencer. Stander was ranked in the top 15 among the world's Heavyweights when he was given a shot at world champion Joe Frazier, prompting his wife Darlene to say the now famous words, "You don't take a Volkswagen into the Indianapolis 500 unless you know a short-cut." 
The fight took place at the Civic Auditorium in Omaha, Nebraska on 25 May 1972. Stander was not knocked out by Frazier, but he lost by a technical knockout after the fourth round, due to heavy cuts, requiring 32 stitches after the fight. This was Frazier's last successful title defense; he would lose to George Foreman in his next bout.
Stander continued boxing until 1982; among his most notable opponents were future world title holders Ken Norton and Gerrie Coetzee, losing to both by TKO. He retired with a record of 37 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws, 28 of those wins coming by knockout.
Stander's success earned him a unique title: The Council Bluffs Butcher.
In 2004, an award-winning documentary entitled "The Bluffs Butcher" and produced by journalism student Andrew Batt, was released. The documentary told the story of Iowa's arguably best shot at a World Heavyweight Boxing Title and chronicled Stander's journey from virtual unknown to boxing's largest stage.

He is the Archbishop emeritus of Boston, a member of the Roman Curia, former archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and titular Cardinal Priest of Santa Susanna, the American Catholic church in Rome.
Law was influential in the first English translation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church in the 1980's. In addition, he is also known for issuing reports maintaining that Freemasonry is incompatible with Roman Catholicism. Law later resigned as Archbishop of Boston on December 13, 2002, allegedly in response to the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal after church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by some Catholic priests within his archdiocese.
Pope John Paul II appointed Law as Archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome in 2004; he resigned from this position upon reaching the age of 80 in November 2011, but continues to live in an apartment within the basilica.

Chester Trent Lott, Sr. (born October 9, 1941) is a former United States Senator from Mississippi, who served in numerous leadership positions in both the United States House of Representatives and the Senate. He entered Congress as one of the first of a wave of Republicans winning seats in Southern states that had been solidly Democratic. He became Senate Majority Leader, then fell from power after praising Strom Thurmond's 1948 segregationist Dixiecrat presidential bid.
Lott entered Congress in 1968 as an administrative assistant to Representative William M. Colmer of Mississippi, who was also the chairman of the House Rules Committee. Upon Colmer's retirement, Lott won Colmer's former seat in the House of Representatives. In 1988, Lott ran successfully for the U.S. Senate to replace another retiree, John Stennis. After Republicans took the majority in the Senate, Lott became Senate Majority Whip in 1995 and then Senate Majority Leader in 1996, upon the resignation of presidential nominee Bob Dole of Kansas.
On December 20, 2002, after significant controversy following comments regarding Strom Thurmond's presidential candidacy, Lott resigned as Senate Minority Leader. He resigned from the Senate in 2007 and Republican Roger Wicker won the 2008 special election to replace him.

Calcium (Ca) deficiency is a plant disorder that can be caused by insufficient calcium in the growing medium, but is more frequently a product of low transpiration of the whole plant or more commonly the affected tissue.  Plants are susceptible to such localized calcium deficiencies in low or nontranspiring tissues because calcium is not transported in the phloem.[tpl]cite web|title= Plant Physiology Online: 5.1 Symptoms of Deficiency In Essential Minerals|url=http://4e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=t&id=289[/tpl] This may be due to water shortages, which slow the transportation of calcium to the plant, poor uptake of calcium through the stem, or can be caused by excessive usage of potassium or nitrogen fertilizers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]

It can be confused with manganese deficiency. A deficiency in the soil is rare but iron can be unavailable for absorption if soil pH is not between about 5 and 6.5.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/focus/chlorosis.html|title=Focus on Plant Problems - Chlorosis|last=Schuster|first=James|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=2008-12-22[/tpl] A common problem is when the soil is too alkaline (the pH is above 6.5). Also, iron deficiency can develop if the soil is too waterlogged or has been overfertilised. Elements like calcium, zinc, manganese, phosphorus, or copper can tie up iron if they are present in high amounts.
Iron is needed to produce chlorophyll, hence its deficiency causes chlorosis. For example, iron is used in the active site of glutamyl-tRNA reductase, an enzyme needed for the formation of 5-Aminolevulinic acid which is a precursor of heme and chlorophyll.A.

Retrieved 29 October 2013 with white separatist aims and is accused of planning to overthrow the ruling African National Congress government and to reinstate a new Boer administered republic reminiscent of the era when Boers administered independent republics during the 19th century following the Great Trek.
South African law enforcement officials charge the Boeremag for being responsible for the 2002 Soweto bombings and arrested twenty-six men, alleged to be members of the Boeremag in November and December 2002, and reportedly seized over 1,000 kilograms of explosives in the process. Further arrests followed in March 2003.
It has since been alleged that the Boeremag case was orchestrated by the Crime Intelligence Department of the South African ANC government as exposed by ex-crime intelligence captain Deon Loots in his affidavit to the High Court which was published in various media articles.
It has also been revealed that the South African government provides an annual slush fund of R600.000.000,00 for its crime intelligence department to source any anti-government movement, which does not require accounting for. slush fund
The first trial of Boeremag suspects began under tight security in Pretoria during May 2003. Twenty-two men were charged with forty-two counts of treason, murder, and illegal weapons possession. Six pleaded not guilty, two have not entered pleas, one refuses to plead, and thirteen are challenging the court's jurisdiction, alleging that the post-apartheid constitution and government of South Africa are illegitimate.
During the trial plans to blow up South African actor Casper de Vries together with eight other individuals was revealed. The group is quoted for saying that the reason for this plan was because De Vries "was not on the right path".[ref]News24: Boeremag planned 'new nation'

Twenty other members of Boeremag were also sentenced to prison terms of between five and 35 years.

The Counties of Sweden ([tpl]lang-sv|Sveriges län[/tpl]) are the first level administrative and political subdivisions of Sweden. Sweden is divided into 21 counties. The counties were established in 1634 on Count Axel Oxenstierna's initiative, superseding the historical provinces of Sweden ([tpl]lang-sv|landskap[/tpl]) to introduce a modern administration. At that time, they were what the translation of län into English literally means; fiefdoms. The county borders often trail the provincial borders, but the Crown often chose to make slight relocations to suit their purposes. There are controversial proposals to divide Sweden into larger regions, replacing the current counties.

[[Magnesium deficiency (plants)]]

CATEGORIES: Physiology, Plant physiology, Magnesium, Biology and pharmacology of chemical elements, Physiological plant disorders

Magnesium (Mg) deficiency is a detrimental plant disorder that occurs most often in strongly acidic, light, sandy soils, where magnesium can be easily leached away. Magnesium is an essential macronutrient found from 0.2-0.4% dry matter and is necessary for normal plant growth.[tpl]cite book|author1=Norman P.A. Huner|author2=William Hopkins|title=Introduction to Plant Physiology 4th Edition|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-24766-2|chapter= 3 & 4[/tpl] thumb|A plant with Magnesium deficiencyExcess potassium, generally due to fertilizers, further aggravates the stress from the magnesium deficiency.[tpl]cite news|author1=Ding Y.|author2=Chang C.|author3=Luo W.|title=High Potassium Aggravates the Oxidative Stress Induced by Magnesium Deficiency in Rice Leaves|journal=Pedosphere|volume=18|issue=3|pages=316–327[/tpl]
Magnesium has an important role in photosynthesis because it forms the central atom of chlorophyll. Therefore, without sufficient amounts of magnesium, plants begin to degrade the chlorophyll in the old leaves. This causes the main symptom of magnesium deficiency, chlorosis, or yellowing between leaf veins, which stay green, giving the leaves a marbled appearance. Due to magnesium’s mobile nature, the plant will first break down chlorophyll in older leaves and transport the Mg to younger leaves which have greater photosynthetic needs.  Therefore, the first sign of magnesium deficiency is the chlorosis of old leaves which progresses to the young leaves as the deficiency continues.[tpl]cite news|author1=Hermans C.|author2=Vuylsteke F.|author3=Coppens F.|title=Systems Analysis of the responses to long-term magnesium deficiency and restoration in Arabidopsis thaliana|journal=New Phytologist|volume=187|pages=132–144[/tpl] Magnesium also is a necessary activator for many critical enzymes, including ribulosbiphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), both essential enzymes in carbon fixation. Thus low amounts of Mg lead to a decrease in photosynthetic and enzymatic activity within the plants. Magnesium is also crucial in stabilizing ribosome structures, hence, a lack of magnesium causes depolymerization of ribosomes leading to pre-mature aging of the plant. After prolonged magnesium deficiency, necrosis and dropping of older leaves occurs. Plants deficient in magnesium also produce smaller, woodier fruits.
Magnesium deficiency may be confused with zinc or chlorine deficiencies, viruses, or natural aging since all have similar symptoms. Adding Epsom salts (diluted to 8.5 oz. per 2.2 gal. of water) or crushed dolomitic limestone to the soil can rectify magnesium deficiencies. For a more organic solution, applying home-made compost mulch can prevent leaching during excessive rainfall and provide plants with sufficient amounts of nutrients, including magnesium.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/problem-solving/magnesium-deficiency/|title= Problem Solving: Magnesium Deficiency[/tpl]

[[Manganese deficiency (plant)]]

CATEGORIES: Physiological plant disorders

Manganese (Mn) deficiency is a plant disorder that is often confused with, and occurs with, iron deficiency. Most common in poorly drained soils, also where organic matter levels are high. Manganese may be unavailable to plants where pH is high.
Affected plants include onion, apple, peas, French beans, cherry and raspberry, and symptoms include yellowing of leaves with smallest leaf veins remaining green to produce a ‘chequered’ effect. The plant may seem to grow away from the problem so that younger
leaves may appear to be unaffected. Brown spots may appear on leaf surfaces, and severely affected leaves turn brown and wither.
Prevention can be achieved by improving soil structure. Do not over-lime.

[[Nitrogen deficiency]]
CATEGORIES: Physiological plant disorders, Nitrogen metabolism

All plants require sufficient supplies of macronutrients for healthy growth, and nitrogen (N) is a nutrient that is commonly in limited supply. Nitrogen deficiency in plants can occur when organic matter with high carbon content, such as sawdust, is added to soil.http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/compost/fundamentals/needs_carbon_nitrogen.htm Soil organisms use any nitrogen to break down carbon sources, making N unavailable to plants. This is known as "robbing" the soil of nitrogen. All vegetables apart from nitrogen fixing legumes are prone to this disorder.
Nitrogen deficiency can be prevented in the short term by using grass mowings as a mulch, or foliar feeding with manure, and in the longer term by building up levels of organic matter in the soil. Sowing green manure crops such as grazing rye to cover soil over the winter will help to prevent nitrogen leaching, while leguminous green manures such as winter tares will fix additional nitrogen from the atmosphere.

[[Gratuity]]

CATEGORIES: Hospitality industry, Service industries, Socioeconomics, Income

A gratuity (also called a tip) is a sum of money customarily tendered, in addition to the basic price, to certain service sector workers for a service performed or anticipated. Tips and their amount are a matter of social custom, and the custom varies between countries and settings. In some locations tipping is discouraged and considered insulting; while in some other locations tipping is expected from customers. The customary amount of a tip can be one of a specific range of monetary amounts or a certain percentage of the bill. In some circumstances, such as with U.S. government workers, receiving of tips is illegal."http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/janqtr/5cfr2635.204.htm". Retrieved 2009-05-28. A service charge is sometimes added to bills in restaurants and similar establishments.
Tipping may not be expected when a fee is explicitly charged for the service.Bly, Laura. "The tipping point: Will service charges replace voluntary gratuities?", USA Today. 2005-08-25.

Robert Guiscard ([tpl]circa|1015[/tpl] – 17 July 1085) was a Norman adventurer conspicuous in the conquest of southern Italy and Sicily. Robert was born into the Hauteville family in Normandy, went on to become Count of Apulia and Calabria (1057–1059), and then Duke of Apulia, Calabria and Sicily (1059–1085).
His sobriquet, in contemporary Latin Viscardus and Old French Viscart, is often rendered "the Resourceful", "the Cunning", "the Wily", "the Fox", or "the Weasel". In Italian sources he is often Roberto il Guiscardo or Roberto d'Altavilla (from Robert de Hauteville).

[[Tancred, King of Sicily]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic monarchs, 1194 deaths, Kings of Sicily, Counts of Lecce, Italo-Normans, Christians of the Third Crusade, House of Hauteville, Year of birth unknown

Tancred (died 20 February 1194) was King of Sicily from 1189 to 1194. He was born in Lecce an illegitimate son of Roger III, Duke of Apulia (the eldest son of King Roger II) by his mistress Emma, a daughter of Achard II, Count of Lecce. He inherited the title "Count of Lecce" from his grandfather and is consequently often referred to as Tancred of Lecce.
Although a member of the Hauteville family, due to his illegitimate status he was known by the surname, Fitz Roger, meaning "son of Roger".
On 9 March 1161, Tancred joined his uncle Simon, Prince of Taranto, in invading the palace, detained the king and queen, William I and Margaret, and their two sons, and incited a massacre of Muslims. Originally, the older of these two sons, Roger IV, Duke of Apulia, was destined to be crowned in place of William, but soon the populace supported the accession of Simon himself. Before Simon could put himself forward as a candidate, however, the rebellion had broken down and the people were restless. The insurrectionists were forced to free the king and retreat to their castles. Pardon was given them on condition of exile and many, including Tancred, took the offer.
In 1174 Tancred led a large fleet to Egypt on behalf of William II. The Sicilians landed near Alexandria but when they realised that their expected allies would not be coming (due to King Amalric I of Jerusalem's death) and with Saladin's army approaching they returned to their ships and sailed home.Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades, vol. II: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East 1100-1187, Penguin Books, 1990, p. 403.
As soon as William II died, in 1189, Tancred rebelled and seized control of the island, and he was crowned King Tancred I of Sicily early in 1190. His coup was backed by the chancellor Matthew d'Ajello and the official class, while the rival claims of Roger II's daughter Constance and her husband, Henry VI, King of the Romans, were supported by most of the nobles.
Tancred was a good soldier, though his tiny stature earned him the nickname "Tancredulus" from the poet chronicler Peter of Eboli. Despite a measure of popular support, his rule faced daunting challenges right from the start. In 1190 Richard I of England arrived in Sicily at the head of a large crusading army on its way to the Holy Land. Richard immediately demanded the release of his sister, William II's Queen Joan, imprisoned by Tancred in 1189, along with every penny of her dowry and inheritance. He also insisted that Tancred fulfil the financial commitments made by William II to the crusade. When Tancred balked at these demands, Richard seized a monastery and the castle of La Bagnara.
Richard was joined in Sicily by the French crusading army, led by King Philip II. The presence of two foreign armies soon caused unrest among the locals. In October the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave the island. Richard responded by attacking Messina, which he captured on 4 October 1190. After the city had been looted and burned, Richard established his base there and decided to stay the winter.
He remained at Messina until March 1191, when Tancred finally agreed to a treaty. According to the treaty's main terms:
After signing the treaty Richard and Philip finally left Sicily for the Holy Land. It is rumoured that before he left, Richard gave Tancred a sword he claimed was Excalibur in order to secure their friendship.M. I. Finley, Denis Mack Smith and Christopher Duggan, A History of Sicily (New York: Viking, 1987), p. 65.
Having at last rid himself of the crusaders, Tancred next confronted the threat from the north. In April 1191 in Rome, Henry and Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress by Pope Celestine III, and now the pair turned south to claim the Kingdom of Sicily in the name of Constance, who was the posthumous daughter of Roger II of Sicily by his third wife Beatrix of Rethel and therefore the legitimate heiress to the throne.
Constance accompanied her husband at the head of a substantial imperial army that descended into the Regno. The northern towns of the kingdom opened their gates to Henry, including the earliest Norman strongholds Capua and Aversa.  Salerno, once Roger II's mainland capital, sent word ahead that Henry was welcome and invited Constance to stay in her father's old palace to escape the summer heat. Naples offered the first resistance of the whole campaign, withstanding a siege with the help of Margaritus of Brindisi's fleet, until much of the army had succumbed to malaria and disease. Eventually the imperial army was forced to withdraw from the kingdom altogether. Constance remained in Salerno with a small garrison, as a sign that Henry would soon return.
Once Henry had withdrawn with the bulk of the imperial army, the towns that had supposedly fallen to the empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. The populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred and delivered Constance to him in Messina, an important prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. However, Tancred was willing to give up his negotiation advantage, that is, the empress, in exchange for Pope Celestine III legitimising him as King of Sicily. In turn, the Pope was hoping that by securing Constance's safe passage back to Rome, Henry would be better disposed towards the papacy, and he was still hoping to keep the empire and the kingdom from uniting. However, imperial soldiers were able to intervene before Constance made it to Rome, and they returned her safely across the Alps.
Henry had left garrisons along the frontiers of the Regno. Tancred now sought to win over the towns by extensive grants of privileges. At Gravina (June 1192) he reinforced his papal support by surrendering the royal legateship over Sicily. In 1192 and 1193 he personally led successful campaigns against the Apulian barons. But his death, at Palermo (20 February 1194), a few days after that of his young son and co-king, Roger III, opened the way for Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily.
His wife Sibylla of Acerra did establish a regency for her second son William III, but Henry VI returned to Italy later that year, his army financed by the lucrative ransom of Richard I. Naples surrendered in May, almost without a blow, and the rest of the Regno followed. Sybilla and the loyal Margaritus prepared to defend Palermo, but the citizens admitted the emperor on 20 November 1194. Tancred's family fell into Henry's hands, and William III, rumoured castrated and blinded, seems to have died in Germany in 1198.

The Battle of Turnhout, 1597 occurred during the Eighty Years' War where Turnhout was in the border area between the Northern and Southern Netherlands. Though the town had not been walled, Turnhout was an important strategic town. On 24 January 1597 on the Tielenheide (this battle is also called 'The battle on Tielenheide') in a neighbouring village (Tielen), Dutch cavalry under command of Prince Maurice met and defeated a Spanish cavalry detachment under Varax. The Spanish cavalry was driven off, after which the Dutch troops burnt parts of the local castle. The ever prudent Maurice failed to follow up and turn the tactical victory into a strategic one.

[[Repentance]]

CATEGORIES: Christian ethics, Christian soteriology, Christian terms, Religious behaviour and experience

Repentance is the activity of reviewing one's actions and feeling contrition or regret for past wrongs.OED: To repent, v "To review one's actions and feel contrition or regret for something one has done or omitted to do; (esp. in religious contexts) to acknowledge the sinfulness of one's past action or conduct by showing sincere remorse and undertaking to reform in the future." It generally involves a commitment to personal change and resolving to live a more responsible and humane life.  The practice of repentance plays an important role in the soteriological doctrines of the world's major religions where it is considered necessary for the attainment of salvation. In religious contexts it often involves an act of confession to a spiritual elder (such as a monk or priest). This typically includes an admission of guilt, a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong where possible. Within a secular context repentance may form part of the process of psychological healing that takes place during a course of psychotherapy.

William II (1155 – 11 November 1189), called the Good, was king of Sicily from 1166 to 1189. William's character is very indistinct. Lacking in military enterprise, secluded and pleasure-loving, he seldom emerged from his palace life at Palermo. Yet his reign is marked by an ambitious foreign policy and a vigorous diplomacy. Champion of the papacy and in secret league with the Lombard cities he was able to defy the common enemy, Frederick I Barbarossa. In the Divine Comedy, Dante places William II in Paradise. He is also referred to in Boccaccio's Decameron (tale V.7).

Tancred or Tankred is a masculine given name of Germanic origin. Tankrad comes from thank- (thought) and -rad (counsel), meaning "well-thought advice". It was used in the High Middle Ages mainly by the Normans (see French Tancrède) and especially associated with the Hauteville family in Italy. It is rare today as a first name, but still common as a Norman surname: Tanqueray. Its Italian form is Tancredi and in Latin it is Tancredus. Its Italian patronymic is also Tancredi.

Ralph d'Escures (died 20 October 1122) was a medieval Abbot of Séez, Bishop of Rochester and then Archbishop of Canterbury. He studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec. In 1079 he entered the abbey of St Martin at Séez, and became abbot there in 1091. He was a friend of both Anselm of Canterbury and Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, whose see, or bishopric, he took over on Gundulf's death.
Ralph was not chosen archbishop of Canterbury by the chapter of Canterbury alone. His election involved an assembly of the lords and bishops meeting with King Henry I of England. Ralph then received his pallium from Pope Paschal II, rather than travelling to Rome to retrieve it. As archbishop, Ralph was very assertive of the rights of the see of Canterbury and of the liberties of the English church. He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland. Ralph also quarrelled for a time with Pope Paschal II.
Ralph suffered a stroke on 11 July 1119 and was left partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly from that time until his death on 20 October 1122. A surviving English translation of a sermon delivered by Ralph is preserved in a manuscript in the British Library. The sermon survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts.

Richard (died 1184) was a medieval Benedictine monk and Archbishop of Canterbury. Employed by Thomas Becket immediately before Becket's death, Richard arranged for Becket to be buried in Canterbury Cathedral and eventually succeeded Becket at Canterbury in a contentious election. Much of Richard's time as archbishop was spent in a dispute with Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York over the primacy of England, and with St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury over the archbishop's jurisdiction over the abbey. Richard enjoyed better relations with King Henry II of England than Becket had, and was employed by the king on diplomatic affairs. Richard also enjoyed the trust of the papacy, and served as a judge for the papacy. Several of his questions to Pope Alexander III were collected into the Decretals, a collection of ecclesiastical laws, and his patronage of canon lawyers did much to advance the study of canon law in England.

Thomas Langton, D.Th., D.Cn.L. (died 27 January 1501) was chaplain to King Edward IV, before becoming successively Bishop of St David's, Bishop of Salisbury, Bishop of Winchester, and Archbishop-elect of Canterbury.
He was born in Appleby-in-Westmorland, and educated by the Carmelite friars there. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, but soon removed to Cambridge, probably to Clare Hall, on account of the plague. In 1461 he was elected fellow of Pembroke Hall, serving as proctor in 1462. While at Cambridge he took both degrees in canon law, and was afterwards incorporated in them at Oxford. In 1464 he left the university, and some time before 1476 was made chaplain to King Edward IV. Langton was in high favour with the king, who trusted him much, and sent him on various important embassies. In 1467 he went as ambassador to France, and as king's chaplain was sent to treat with Ferdinand II, king of Aragon, on 24 November 1476. He visited France again on diplomatic business on 30 November 1477, and on 11 August 1478, to conclude the espousals of Edward's daughter Elizabeth and Charles, son of the French king. Two years later he was sent to demand the fulfilment of this marriage treaty, but the prince, now Charles VIII, king of France, refused to carry it out, and the match was broken off.[tpl]DNB|inline=1|wstitle=Langton, Thomas[/tpl]

Finally, a proof of his ever-increasing popularity, Langton was elected Archbishop of Canterbury on 22 January 1501,[tpl]Harvnb|Fryde|Greenway|Porter|Roy|1986[/tpl], Handbook of British Chronology, p. 234.[tpl]Cite book |last1=Jones |first1=B. |year=1962 |chapterurl=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=32708 |chapter=Archbishops of Canterbury |title=Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1300–1541: Volume 4: Monastic Cathedrals (Southern Province) |publisher=British History Online |pages=3–5[/tpl] but died of the plague on the 27th, before the confirmation of the deed. He was buried in a marble tomb within 'a very fair chapel' which he had built south of the lady-chapel in Winchester Cathedral.
Before his death he had given 10 shillings towards the erection of Great St. Mary's Church, Cambridge, and in 1497 a drinking-cup, weighing 67 ounces, called the 'Anathema Cup,' to Pembroke Hall. This is the oldest extant hanap or covered cup that is hall-marked. By his will, dated 16 January 1501, Langton left large sums of money to the priests of Clare Hall, Cambridge, money and vestments to the fellows and priests of Queen's College, Oxford, besides legacies to the friars at both universities, and to the Carmelites at Appleby-in-Westmorland. To his sister and her husband, Rowland Machel, lands (probably the family estates) in Westmorland and two hundred marks were bequeathed. An annual pension of eight marks was set aside to maintain a chapel at Appleby-in-Westmorland for a hundred years to pray for the souls of Langton, his parents, and all the faithful deceased at Appleby-in-Westmorland.

Oda (or Odo; died 958), called the Good or the Severe, was a 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury in England. The son of a Danish invader, Oda became Bishop of Ramsbury before 928. A number of stories were told about his actions both prior to becoming and while a bishop, but few of these incidents are recorded in contemporary accounts. After being named to Canterbury in 941, Oda was instrumental in crafting royal legislation as well as involved in providing rules for his clergy. Oda was also involved in the efforts to reform religious life in England. He died in 958 and legendary tales afterwards were ascribed to him.

[[Frequency analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptographic attacks, Quantitative linguistics

In cryptanalysis, frequency analysis is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext. The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers.
Frequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies. Moreover, there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language. For instance, given a section of English language, E, T, A and O are the most common, while Z, Q and X are rare.

[[Plaintext]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography

In cryptography, plaintext  is information a sender wishes to transmit to a receiver. Cleartext is often used as a synonym.
Plaintext has reference to the operation of cryptographic algorithms, usually encryption algorithms, and is the input upon which they operate. Cleartext, by contrast, refers to data that is transmitted or stored unencrypted (that is, 'in the clear').
Before the computer era, plaintext most commonly meant message text in the language of the communicating parties.
Since computers became commonly available, the definition has expanded to include:
Much of this data is not directly meaningful to humans, being already transformed into computer manipulable forms.
While the original definition implied that the message could be read by a human being, the modern definition emphasizes that a person using a computer could easily interpret the data.
Any information which the communicating parties wish to conceal from others can now be treated, and referred to, as plaintext. Thus, in a significant sense, plaintext is the 'normal' representation of data before any action has been taken to conceal, compress, or 'digest' it. It need not represent text, and even if it does, the text may not be "plain".
Plaintext is used as input to an encryption algorithm; the output is usually termed ciphertext particularly when the algorithm is a cipher. Codetext is less often used, and almost always only when the algorithm involved is actually a code. In some systems, however, multiple layers of encryption are used, in which case the output of one encryption algorithm becomes plaintext input for the next.

Robert Florey (14 September 1900, Paris - 16 May 1979, Santa Monica, California) was a French-American director, screenwriter, film journalist and occasional actor.
Born in Paris, and at first a film journalist, Florey moved to the United States in September 1921.  As a director Florey's most productive decades were the 1930s and 1940s, working on relatively low-budget programmers for Paramount and Warner Brothers.  His reputation is balanced between his avant-garde expressionist style, most evident in his early career, and his work as a fast, reliable studio-system director called on to finished troubled projects, such as 1939's Hotel Imperial.
He directed more than 50 movies.  His most popular film is likely the first Marx Brothers feature The Cocoanuts of 1929, and his 1932 foray into Universal-style horror, Murders in the Rue Morgue is regarded by horror fans as highly reflective of German expressionism.  In 2006, as his 1937 film Daughter of Shanghai was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, Florey was called "widely acclaimed as the best director working in major studio B-films".Librarian of Congress Adds Home Movie, Silent Films and Hollywood Classics to Film Preservation List

The 33 Variations on a waltz by Anton Diabelli, Op. 120, commonly known as the Diabelli Variations, is a set of variations for the piano written between 1819 and 1823 by Ludwig van Beethoven on a waltz composed by Anton Diabelli. It is often considered to be one of the greatest sets of variations for keyboard along with J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations.
The music writer Donald Tovey called it "the greatest set of variations ever written".[tpl]Harvnb|Tovey|1944|p=124[/tpl] The pianist Alfred Brendel has described it as "the greatest of all piano works".Kinderman, William, Beethoven, Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 211. It also comprises, in the words of Hans von Bülow, "a microcosm of Beethoven's art".[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] In Beethoven: The Last Decade 1817–1827, Martin Cooper writes, "The variety of treatment is almost without parallel, so that the work represents a book of advanced studies in Beethoven's manner of expression and his use of the keyboard, as well as a monumental work in its own right".Cooper, Martin, Beethoven: The Last Decade 1817–1827, Oxford University Press, 1985. In his Structural Functions of Harmony, Arnold Schoenberg writes that the Diabelli Variations "in respect of its harmony, deserves to be called the most adventurous work by Beethoven".Schoenberg, Arnold, Structural Functions of Harmony, W. W. Norton & Company, ISBN 0-393-00478-3, ISBN 978-0-393-00478-6, 1969, p. 91.
Beethoven's approach to the theme is to take some of its smallest elements – the opening turn, the descending fourth and fifth, the repeated notes – and build upon them pieces of great imagination, power and subtlety. Alfred Brendel wrote, "The theme has ceased to reign over its unruly offspring. Rather, the variations decide what the theme may have to offer them. Instead of being confirmed, adorned and glorified, it is improved, parodied, ridiculed, disclaimed, transfigured, mourned, stamped out and finally uplifted".Brendel, Alfred, "Beethoven's Diabelli Variations", in Alfred Brendel On Music, a capella, Chicago, 2001, p. 114.
Beethoven does not seek variety by using key-changes, staying with Diabelli's C-major for most of the set: among the first twenty-eight variations, he uses the tonic minor only once. Then, nearing the conclusion, Beethoven uses the tonic minor for Variations 29–31 and for Variation 32, a triple fugue, he switches to E-flat major. Coming at this late point, after such a long period in C-major, the key-change has an increased dramatic effect. At the end of the fugue, a culminating flourish consisting of a diminished seventh arpeggio is followed by a series of quiet chords punctuated by silences. These chords lead back to Diabelli's C-major for Variation 33, a closing minuet.

[[Genetic fallacy]]

The genetic fallacy, also known as fallacy of origins, fallacy of virtue,[tpl]cite web|title=A List Of Fallacious Arguments|url=http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#genetic|accessdate=6 October 2012[/tpl] is a fallacy of irrelevance where a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's origin rather than its current meaning or context.  This overlooks any difference to be found in the present situation, typically transferring the positive or negative esteem from the earlier context.
The fallacy therefore fails to assess the claim on its merit.  The first criterion of a good argument is that the premises must have bearing on the truth or falsity of the claim in question.Attacking Faulty Reasoning: A Practical Guide to Fallacy-Free Arguments (Third Edition) by T. Edward Damer, chapter II, subsection "The Relevance Criterion" (pg. 12)  Genetic accounts of an issue may be true, and they may help illuminate the reasons why the issue has assumed its present form, but they are irrelevant to its merits.With Good Reason: An Introduction to Informal Fallacies (Fifth Edition) by S.

The Winter of Discontent refers to the winter of 1978–79 in the United Kingdom, during which there were widespread strikes by public sector trade unions demanding larger pay rises, following the ongoing pay caps of the Labour Party government led by James Callaghan against Trades Union Congress opposition to control inflation, during the coldest winter for 16 years.
The strikes were a result of the Labour government's attempt to control inflation by a forced departure from their social contract with the unions by imposing rules on the public sector that pay rises be kept below 5%, to control inflation in itself and as an example to the private sector. However, some employees' unions conducted their negotiations within mutually agreed limits above this limit with employers.On This Day: 1979: Early election as Callaghan defeated, BBC. Retrieved 17 December 2007 While the strikes were largely over by February 1979, the government's inability to contain the strikes earlier helped lead to Margaret Thatcher's Conservative victory in the 1979 general election and legislation to restrict unions. Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by gravediggers working in Liverpool and Tameside, and strikes by refuse collectors. Additionally, NHS ancillary workers formed picket lines to blockade hospital entrances with the result that many hospitals were reduced to taking emergency patients only.
The phrase "Winter of Discontent" is from the opening line of William Shakespeare's Richard III: "Now is the Winter of our Discontent / Made glorious summer by this son of York…", and was first applied to the events of the winter by Robin Chater, a writer at Incomes Data Report. It was subsequently used in a speech by James Callaghan and translated to define a crisis by tabloids – including The Sun.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zypBsOadOx8C&pg=PA480&dq=phrase+%22winter+of+discontent%22+Larry+Lamb&hl=en&ei=A8P3TJ7UM9GahQeH0LHGDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&sqi=2&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=phrase%20%22winter%20of%20discontent%22%20Larry%20Lamb&f=false |title=Unreliable sources: how the 20th… |publisher= Google Books |accessdate=2 December 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2fb76vADw4QC&pg=PA84&dq=phrase+%22winter+of+discontent%22+Larry+Lamb&hl=en&ei=A8P3TJ7UM9GahQeH0LHGDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&sqi=2&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Popular newspapers, the Labour Party… | publisher = Google Books |accessdate=2 December 2010 [/tpl]

Though not a prayer, this dry legal formula and its ceremonial accompaniment have been charged with emotional undertones since the medieval period, creating a dramatic introduction to Yom Kippur on what is often dubbed "Kol Nidrei night"."Kol Nidre". The New Encyclopedia of Judaism (1st ed. 2002). It is written in Aramaic, not Hebrew. Its name is taken from the opening words, meaning all vows.
Kol Nidrei has had an eventful history, both in itself and in its influence on the legal status of the Jews. Introduced into the liturgy despite the opposition of some rabbinic authorities, it was attacked in the course of time by some rabbis and in the 19th century expunged from the prayer book by many communities of western Europe.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/1392-jews-frankfort.html |title=Jewish History Sourcebook: An Oath Taken by Jews Frankfort on the Main, about 1392 CE[/tpl]

The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, also known as the Battle of Quebec, (Bataille des Plaines d'Abraham or Première bataille de Québec in French) was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought between the British Army and Navy, and the French Army, on a plateau just outside the walls of Quebec City, on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle.  The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops between both sides, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-of-quebec.htm |title=Battle of Quebec |year=2007 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ctwr45mb |archivedate=8 December 2008 [/tpl]
The culmination of a three-month siege by the British, the battle lasted about 15 minutes. British troops commanded by General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadien militia under General Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm, using new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle; Wolfe received three gunshot wounds that would end his life within minutes of the beginning of the engagement and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a musket ball wound just below his ribs. In the wake of the battle, the French evacuated the city; their remaining military force in Canada and the rest of North America came under increasing pressure from British forces.
While the French forces continued to fight and prevailed in several battles after Quebec was captured, the British did not relinquish their hold on the virtually impregnable Citadelle. That tenacity carried over to other areas in North America; within four years, with the Treaty of Paris, most of France's possessions in eastern North America would be ceded to Great Britain.

Data General was one of the first minicomputer firms from the late 1960s. Three of the four founders were former employees of Digital Equipment Corporation. Their first product, the Data General Nova, was a 16-bit minicomputer. This used their own operating system, RDOS, and in conjunction with programming languages like "Data General Business Basic" they provided a multi-user operating system with record locking and inbuilt data bases far ahead of many contemporary systems. The Nova was followed by the Supernova and Eclipse product lines, all of which were used in many applications for the next two decades. The company employed an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) sales strategy to sell to third parties who incorporated Data General computers into the OEM's specific product lines. A series of missteps in the 1980s, including missing the advance of microcomputers despite the launch of the microNOVA in 1977, and the Data General-One portable computer in 1984, led to a decline in the company's market share. The company did continue into the 1990s, however, and was eventually acquired by EMC Corporation in 1999.

West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States holding that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protected students from being forced to salute the American flag and say the Pledge of Allegiance in school. The Court's 6-3 opinion, delivered by Justice Robert H. Jackson, is remembered for its forceful defense of free speech and constitutional rights generally as being placed "beyond the reach of majorities and officials."
It was a significant court victory won by Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religion forbade them from saluting or pledging to symbols, including symbols of political institutions. However, the Court did not address the effect the compelled salutation and recital ruling had upon their particular religious beliefs, but instead ruled that the state did not have the power to compel speech in that manner for anyone.
Barnette overruled a 1940 decision on the same issue, Minersville School District v. Gobitis (also involving the children of Jehovah's Witnesses), in which the Court stated that the proper recourse for dissent was to try to change the school policy democratically.
However, in overruling Gobitis the Court primarily relied on the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment rather than the Free Exercise Clause."The Flag Salute Cases", Historic U.S. Court Cases by John W. Johnson, ©2001, Routledge, page 953, "Though the Flag Salute Cases are generally seen as involving freedom of religion, that issue is virtually absent from Jackson's majority opinion. He accepted, without question, that the Jehovah's iWitnesses sincerely held beliefs which made it impossible for them to conscientiously salute the flag. But Jackson did not offer any analysis of the importance of that belief or even of the role of religious freedom in striking down the mandatory flag salute. Rather than grounding his opinion in terms of freedom of religion, Jackson analyzed the case as one of freedom of speech and expression." Online

Thurstan is its anglicised version.[/tpl] or Turstin of Bayeux (c. 1070 – 6 February 1140) was a medieval Archbishop of York, the son of a priest. He served kings William II and Henry I of England before his election to the see of York in 1114. Once elected, his consecration was delayed for five years while he fought attempts by the Archbishop of Canterbury to assert primacy over York. Eventually, he was consecrated by the pope instead and allowed to return to England. While archbishop, he secured two new suffragan bishops for his province. When Henry I died, Thurstan supported Henry's nephew Stephen of Blois as king. Thurstan also defended the northern part of England from invasion by the Scots, taking a leading part in organising the English forces at the Battle of the Standard (1138). Shortly before his death, Thurstan resigned from his see and took the habit of a Cluniac monk.

The Gladden Fields (Sindarin Loeg Ningloron) is a location in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. In his works, the Gladden Fields are located where the Gladden river joins the Anduin.
In the year [tpl]ME-date|TA|2[/tpl], at the Gladden Fields, Isildur and his three eldest sons (Ciryon, Aratan and Elendur) were ambushed by Orcs. Isildur attempted to escape by jumping into the Anduin, using the power of invisibility of the One Ring, but the Ring slipped from Isildur's finger and sank to the bottom of the river.

Ranulf Flambard (sometimes Ralph Flambard, Ranulph Flambard, or Ranulf Passiflamme;Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England p. 147 c. 1060 – 5 September 1128) was a medieval Norman Bishop of Durham and an influential government minister of King William Rufus of England. Ranulf was the son of a priest of Bayeux, Normandy, and his nickname Flambard means incendiary or torch-bearer, and may have referred to his personality. He started his career under King William I of England, probably in the compilation of the Domesday Book, as well as being the keeper of the king's seal. On the death of William I, Ranulf chose to serve the new king of England, William Rufus.
Under Rufus, he continued to hold the king's seal, and also became involved in the financial administration of the kingdom, where he quickly made a name for himself by his novel methods of raising revenue. He was given custody of a number of vacant ecclesiastical offices, administering at one point sixteen vacant bishoprics or abbeys. His many duties have led to him being considered the first Chief Justiciar of England. During Rufus' reign, Ranulf supervised the construction of the first stone bridge in London and oversaw the construction of the king's hall at Westminster. In 1099 he was rewarded with the bishopric of Durham.
On the death of Rufus in 1100, Ranulf was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Rufus' successor Henry I of England. Ranulf was a convenient scapegoat for the financial extortions of Rufus' reign. He became the first prisoner to escape from the Tower and went into exile in Normandy with Rufus' and Henry's older brother Robert Curthose, the Duke of Normandy. Ranulf became a leading advisor to Robert, and assisted in his unsuccessful invasion of England, an attempt to oust Henry from the throne. The brothers reconciled, but although Ranulf was restored to office he spent the next few years in Normandy, returning only after Henry had defeated Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray. Ranulf subsequently retired from political life, with only occasional appearances in public. He remained active in ecclesiastical affairs, attending councils and working to defend the rights of his see.

William de St-Calais (also Calais or Carileph or Carilef; died 1096) was a medieval Norman monk, abbot of the abbey of Saint-Vincent in Le Mans in Maine, who was nominated by King William I of England as Bishop of Durham in 1080. During his term as bishop, St-Calais replaced the canons of his cathedral chapter with monks, and began the construction of Durham Cathedral. In addition to his ecclesiastical duties, he served as a commissioner for the Domesday Book. He was also a councilor and advisor to both King William I and his son, King William II, known as William Rufus. Following William Rufus' accession to the throne in 1087, St-Calais is considered by scholars to have been the new king's chief advisor.
However, when the king's uncle, Odo of Bayeux, raised a rebellion against the king in 1088, St-Calais was implicated in the revolt. William Rufus laid siege to St-Calais in the bishop's stronghold of Durham, and later put him on trial for treason. A contemporary record of this trial, the De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi, is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial. Imprisoned briefly, St-Calais was allowed to go into exile after his castle at Durham was surrendered to the king. He went to Normandy, where he became a leading advisor to Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, the elder brother of William Rufus. By 1091, St-Calais had returned to England and regained royal favour.
In England, St-Calais once more became a leading advisor to the king. In 1093 he negotiated with Anselm, Abbot of Bec, concerning Anselm's becoming Archbishop of Canterbury; in 1095 it was St-Calais who prosecuted the royal case against Anselm after he had become archbishop. During his bishopric, St-Calais stocked the cathedral library with books, especially canon law texts. He was also active in defending the north of England against Scots raids. Before his death, he had made his peace with Anselm, who blessed and consoled St-Calais on his deathbed.

[[Symeon of Durham]]

CATEGORIES: English chroniclers, 12th-century historians, 12th-century English people, English Christian monks, 1129 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Symeon (or Simeon) of Durham (died after 1129) was an English chronicler and a monk of Durham Priory.  When William of Saint-Calais returned from his Norman exile in 1091, Symeon was probably in his company.  Symeon eventually became precentor of the priory, and examples of his handwriting appear to survive in several Durham books, including the Liber Vitae, the so-called Cantor's Book (whose text he would have had to keep up to date as part of his duties as precentor), and in copies of his own historical works.Rollason, Introduction to Libellus de Exordio, pp. xliv-l.
Symeon was author of two historical works which are particularly valuable for northern affairs, the Libellus de Exordio atque Procursu istius, hoc est Dunelmensis, Ecclesie (The Little Book on the Origins and Progress of this Church, that is of Durham) and a historical compilation Historia regum Anglorum et Dacorum.  The Libellus de Exordio, a history of the community of Durham (originally settled at Lindisfarne) from its inception to the year 1096, is by far his most important work.  Composed between 1104 and 1107, Symeon's task (imposed on him by his monastic superiors) was to demonstrate the continuity of Durham's history despite the notable disruptions the community weathered during the Viking invasions and even more recently in the Norman Conquest.  Symeon sought furthermore to justify William of Saint-Calais's expulsion of Durham's clerical community in 1083, in order to replace it with a group of Benedictine monks drawn from Wearmouth and Jarrow.  Like earlier Durham writers, Symeon finds historical continuity between the major phases of the community's development in the constant presence of their patron, Saint Cuthbert.  The miracles worked in Cuthbert's name during the late Anglo-Saxon period were particularly flamboyant, and the Libellus contains engaging accounts of some of these, including the miracle of the three waves (when Cuthbert turned a portion of the Irish Sea into blood in order to prevent his followers from taking his relics out of England, see Libellus ii.11), the foundation of Durham (when Cuthbert's body, being moved across England on a cart, refused to be moved, signaling his desire to remain at Durham, see Libellus iii.1), and several picturesque deaths visited upon the enemies of Cuthbert's devotees.
Several versions of the Libellus survive from the Middle Ages.  Symeon's own revised copy can be found in Durham, University Library, Cosin V.II.6.  It is this text which has been most often published.  The Durham manuscript also contains two anonymous continuations of Symeon's work. The first carries the history from 1096 to the death of Ranulf Flambard (1129); the second extends from 1133 to 1144. A Cambridge manuscript (Cambridge, University Library, Ff. i.27) contains a third continuation covering the years 1145-1154. Another manuscript (London, British Library, Cotton Faustina A.V) seems to represent the text of the Libellus before the revisions found in the Durham manuscript.Rollason, Introduction to Libellus de Exordio, lxiii-lxv.  A full list of manuscripts can be found on the Libellus de Exordio page.
About 1129 Symeon undertook to write a Historia regum Anglorum et Dacorum. This begins at the point where the Ecclesiastical History of Bede ends. Up to 957 Simeon merely copies some old Durham annals, not otherwise preserved, which are of value for northern history; from that point to 1119 he copies John of Worcester with certain interpolations. The section dealing with the years 1119-1129 is, however, an independent and practically contemporaneous narrative. Symeon writes, for his time, with ease and perspicuity; but his chief merit is that of a diligent collector and copyist.
Symeon also wrote brief biographies of the archbishops of York and a letter on the errors of Origen.  Other writings have been attributed to his pen, but on no good authority. They are printed in the Scriptores decem of Roger Twysden (1652). The most complete modern edition is that of Thomas Arnold (Rolls series, 2 vols., 1882–1885).  For the Libellus, now see Rollason's 2000 edition.
The value of the "Northumbrian Annals," which Symeon used for the Historia regum, has been discussed by John Hodgson-Hinde in the preface to his Symeonis Dunelmensis opera, vol. i. pp. xiv. ff. (1868); by R. Pauli in Forschungen zur deutschen Geschichte, xii. pp. 137 sqq. (Göttingen, 1872).

[[Genetic recombination]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular processes, Molecular genetics

Genetic recombination is the process by which two DNA molecules exchange genetic information, resulting in the production of a new combination of alleles.  In eukaryotes, genetic recombination during meiosis can lead to a novel set of genetic information that can be passed on to progeny. Most recombination is naturally occurring. During meiosis in eukaryotes, genetic recombination involves the pairing of homologous chromosomes. This may be followed by information exchange between the chromosomes.  The information exchange may occur without physical exchange (a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another, without the donating chromosome being changed)(see SDSA pathway in Figure); or by the breaking and rejoining of DNA strands, which forms new molecules of DNA (see DHJ pathway in Figure). Recombination may also occur during mitosis in eukaryotes where it ordinarily involves the two sister chromosomes formed after chromosomal replication. In this case, new combinations of alleles are not produced since the sister chromosomes are usually identical.  In meiosis and mitosis, recombination occurs between similar molecules (homologs) of DNA. In meiosis, non-sister homologous chromosomes pair with each other so that recombination characteristically occurs between non-sister homologues. In both meiotic and mitotic cells, recombination between homologous chromosomes is a common mechanism used in DNA repair.
Genetic recombination and recombinational DNA repair also occurs in  bacteria and archaea. 
Recombination can be artificially induced in laboratory (in vitro) settings, producing recombinant DNA for purposes including vaccine development.
V(D)J recombination in organisms with an adaptive immune system is a type of site-specific genetic recombination that helps immune cells rapidly diversify to recognize and adapt to new pathogens.

The States' Rights Democratic Party (usually called the Dixiecrats) was a short-lived segregationist political party in the United States in 1948. It originated as a breakaway faction of the Democratic Party in 1948, determined to protect what they portrayed as the southern way of life beset by an oppressive federal government,Lemmon, Sarah McCulloh. "Ideology of the 'Dixiecrat Movement," Social Forces Vol. 30, No. 2 (Dec., 1951),  pp. 162-171 in JSTOR and supporters assumed control of the state Democratic parties in part or in full in several Southern states. The States' Rights Democratic Party opposed racial integration and wanted to retain Jim Crow laws and white supremacy in the face of possible federal intervention. Members were called Dixiecrats. (The term Dixiecrat is a portmanteau of Dixie, referring to the Southern United States, and Democrat.) 
The party did not run local or state candidates, and after the 1948 election its leaders generally returned to the Democratic Party.John F. Bibby and Louis Sandy Maisel, Two parties--or more?: the American party system (1998) p 35  The Dixiecrats had little short-run impact on politics. However, they did have a long-term impact. The Dixiecrats began the weakening of the "Solid South" (the Democratic Party's total control of presidential elections in the South).Kari Frederickson, The Dixiecrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932-1968 (2001) p. 238.
The term "Dixiecrat" is sometimes used by Northern Democrats to refer to conservative Southern Democrats from the 1940s to the 1990s, regardless of where they stood in 1948.see Harry Kreisler, "Institutional Change in the U.S. Congress: Conversation with Nelson W. Polsby...2002"

[[Lipid bilayer]]

CATEGORIES: Biological matter, Membrane biology

The lipid bilayer is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around cells. The cell membrane of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, even though they are only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by pumping ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.
Natural bilayers are usually composed of phospholipids, which have a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails each. When phospholipids are exposed to water, they arrange themselves into a two-layered sheet (a bilayer) with all of their tails pointing toward the center of the sheet. The center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water but not in oil. This assembly process is similar to the coalescing of oil droplets in water and is driven by the same force, called the hydrophobic effect. Because lipid bilayers are quite fragile and are so thin that they are invisible in a traditional microscope, bilayers are very challenging to study. Experiments on bilayers often require advanced techniques like electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.
Phospholipids with certain head groups can alter the surface chemistry of a bilayer and can, for example, mark a cell for destruction by the immune system. Lipid tails can also affect membrane properties, for instance by determining the phase of the bilayer. The bilayer can adopt a solid gel phase state at lower temperatures but undergo phase transition to a fluid state at higher temperatures. The packing of lipids within the bilayer also affects its mechanical properties, including its resistance to stretching and bending. Many of these properties have been studied with the use of artificial "model" bilayers produced in a lab. Vesicles made by model bilayers have also been used clinically to deliver drugs.
Biological membranes typically include several types of lipids other than phospholipids. A particularly important example in animal cells is cholesterol, which helps strengthen the bilayer and decrease its permeability. Cholesterol also helps regulate the activity of certain integral membrane proteins. Integral membrane proteins function when incorporated into a lipid bilayer. Because bilayers define the boundaries of the cell and its compartments, these membrane proteins are involved in many intra- and inter-cellular signaling processes. Certain kinds of membrane proteins are involved in the process of fusing two bilayers together. This fusion allows the joining of two distinct structures as in the fertilization of an egg by sperm or the entry of a virus into a cell.

[[Letter of credence]]

CATEGORIES: Diplomacy, Letters (message)

A letter of credence is a formal letter, usually sent by one head of state to another, that formally grants diplomatic accreditation to a named individual to be the sending country's ambassador in the receiving country.  A letter of recall is the opposite, recalling an ambassador, either as a means of diplomatic protest (see letter of protest) or because the diplomat is being replaced by another envoy. Diplomatic letters are generally written in French (the lingua franca of diplomacy), unless the countries share the same official language.
Letters of credence are presented personally to the receiving head of state by ambassador-designates in a formal ceremony.  Letters of credence are also referred to as "credentials," and the ambassador is said to be "presenting his credentials."  Until his credentials are accepted, an ambassador-designate does not formally assume diplomatic status, including the possession of diplomatic immunity.  In practice, however, they are almost invariably accepted, as both states will have informally discussed the issue in advance and sorted out any problems.
In parliamentary democracies, heads of state or their representatives accept or reject diplomatic credentials on the basis of advice (binding instructions to the head of state) from the government.  Often, a minister in the government or in cabinet will attend (be present with) the head of state at the actual ceremony, to symbolize the fact that the acceptance of the credentials is on the basis of government advice.  
When two countries maintain relations at the chargé level, the letter of credence will be written by the foreign minister of the sending state, and addressed to the foreign minister of the receiving state.  The chargé will also formally present his credentials to the foreign minister.  [tpl]cite book|title=Instructions to the Diplomatic Officers of the United States|date=1897|location=Washington, DC|pages=1-5|author=U.S. Department of State[/tpl]  The head of state is neither addressed nor presented with the credentials, symbolizing the lower level of diplomatic relations between the countries.

CATEGORIES: Barnacles, Parasitic crustaceans, Diseases and parasites of crustaceans

Sacculina is a genus of barnacles that is a parasitic castrator of crabs. The adults bear no resemblance to the barnacles that cover ships and piers; they are recognised as barnacles because their larval forms are like other members of the barnacle class Cirripedia. Depending on the location, the prevalence of this unusual crustacean parasite in its crab host can be as high as 50%.Ross Piper (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press.

[[Sanctacaris]]

CATEGORIES: Prehistoric chelicerates, Burgess Shale fossils

Sanctacaris is a Middle Cambrian arthropod from the Burgess Shale of British Columbia. It was most famously regarded as a primitive chelicerate, a group which includes spiders and scorpions, although subsequent phylogenetic studies have not always supported this conclusion; it is best accommodated in the arachnate clade (i.e. as a stem-group chelicerate).
Sanctacaris specimens range from 46 to 93 mm in length.[tpl]cite journal |author=Briggs, Derek E. G. |author2=Collins, Desmond |year=1988 |title=A Middle Cambrian chelicerate from Mount Stephen, British Columbia |journal=Palaeontology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=779–798 |url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2031/Pages%20779-798.pdf |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |format=PDF [/tpl] The head bears five pairs of grasping appendages and a sixth pair of large separate appendages. The grasping appendages each bear a short antenna-like second appendage. There are 11 body segments, each with a pair of walking legs and gills. There is a broad, flat paddle-like telson.
Originally Sanctacaris was called informally 'Santa Claws'. Its Latin name translates as "saintly crab".[tpl]fotbs[/tpl] Unlike most other Burgess forms, Sanctacaris is not present in Charles Walcott's 1909 quarry and was discovered at a different level by Desmond Collins in 1980–1981.[tpl]fotbs[/tpl]

The First Dáil ([tpl]lang-ga|An Chéad Dáil[/tpl]) was Dáil Éireann as it convened from 1919–1921. It was the first meeting of the unicameral parliament of the revolutionary Irish Republic. In 1919 candidates who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead established an independent legislature in Dublin called "Dáil Éireann" (English: Assembly of Ireland). The establishment of the First Dáil occurred on the same day as the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence. After elections in 1921 the First Dáil was succeeded by the Second Dáil of 1921–1922.

[[River Derwent, North East England]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of County Durham, Rivers of Northumberland

The River Derwent is a river on the border between County Durham and Northumberland in the north east of England. It broadens into the Derwent Reservoir, west of Consett.  The Derwent is a tributary of the River Tyne, which it joins near the MetroCentre. The river flows for 35 miles from its origin, where two streams meet approximately a mile west of Blanchland, to Derwenthaugh where it flows into the River Tyne. On its journey, the river flows through places such as Allensford, Shotley Bridge, Blackhall Mill and Rowlands Gill. The river is known locally as "The Divvy"[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] . Derwent Walk Country Park named after it is at Rowlands Gill. Fishing permits on the river are usually priced at £3.00 on each stretch.
The name Derwent comes from the Brythonic/Early Welsh word for oak derw, harking back to the time when the Derwent Valley was inhabited by a British-speaking population.

[[River Derwent, Cumbria]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Cumbria

 
The Derwent is a river in the Lake District of the county of Cumbria in the north of England. The name Derwent is derived from a Celtic word for "oak trees".
The river rises at Styhead Tarn underneath Scafell Pike and flows in a northerly direction through the valley of Borrowdale, before continuing through Derwentwater, giving the lake its name.
The Derwent then continues into Bassenthwaite Lake, picking up the waters of the River Greta just outside Keswick.
Beyond Bassenthwaite Lake the river flows westwards through the Isel Valley, before leaving the Lake District National Park just before reaching Cockermouth.
Another tributary is the River Cocker, which joins the Derwent at Cockermouth, through which the Derwent flows after exiting the Lake District on its now westerly course. After leaving Cockermouth, the river flows by Papcastle where a Roman fort bears the name of the river.
The river flows into the Irish Sea at Workington.

[[Derwentwater]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Cumbria, Cumberland

Derwentwater (or Derwent Water) is one of the principal bodies of water in the Lake District National Park in north west England.  It lies wholly within the Borough of Allerdale, in the county of Cumbria.
The lake occupies part of Borrowdale and lies immediately south of the town of Keswick. It is both fed and drained by the River Derwent. It measures approximately [tpl]convert|3|mi|km[/tpl] long by [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] wide and is some [tpl]convert|72|ft|m[/tpl] deep. There are several islands within the lake, one of which is inhabited. Derwent Island House, an 18th-century residence, is a tenanted National Trust property open to the public on five days each year. 
Derwentwater is a place of considerable scenic value. It is surrounded by hills (known locally as fells), and many of the slopes facing Derwentwater are extensively wooded. A regular passenger launch operates on the lake, taking passengers between various landing stages. There are seven lakeside marinas, the most popular stops being: Keswick, Portinscale and the Lodore Falls, from which boats may be hired. Recreational walking is a major tourist activity in the area and an extensive network of footpaths exists within the hills and woods surrounding the lake.
The Keswick—Borrowdale road runs along the eastern shore of the lake and carries a regular bus service. There is a lesser, or unclassified, road along the western shore connecting the villages of Grange and Portinscale.
Derwentwater gave its name to the Earldom of Derwentwater.
The lake is believed to be the last remaining native habitat of the vendace (Coregonus vandesius) fish from the 4 originally known sites: Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwent Water in the Lake District and the Castle Loch & Mill Loch in Lochmaben.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/7266730.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ice Age fish thrives in new home | date=2008-02-27 | accessdate=2010-05-01[/tpl]

The Derwent is a river in Yorkshire in the north of England. It is used for water abstraction, leisure and sporting activities and effluent disposal as well as being of significant importance as the site of several nature reserves. It is the subject of conflicting interests as well as having an interesting ice age past and a long recorded history.
It rises on Fylingdales Moor in the North York Moors National Park, flows southwards as far as its confluence with the River Hertford then westwards through the Vale of Pickering, south through Kirkham Gorge and the Vale of York and joins the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh. The confluence is unusual in that the Derwent converges on the Ouse at a shallow angle in an upstream direction.
The River Derwent catchment area includes the Upper Derwent, River Rye, River Hertford, Bielby Beck and Pocklington canal and their tributaries. It covers an area of 2,057 square kilometres and includes the towns of Stamford Bridge, Malton, Pickering, Helmsley, Filey and Scarborough. The area is bounded by the Cleveland Hills, North York Moors and Hambleton Hills to the north, the Yorkshire Wolds and the coast to the east, the Vale of York to the west and the River Ouse and Humber Estuary to the south. The area around the river is primarily rural in nature with grazing moorland in the upland areas and a variety of agricultural uses at lower levels. There are large areas of designated conservation sites throughout the area.
Water abstracted from the Derwent supplies towns and cities such as Hull, Leeds, York and Scarborough. The river is of generally good quality with BOD levels remaining below 2 mg/l all year round.  It is typical of Northerly British rivers in that it exhibits acid flushes at peak times of rainfall, namely during the winter months.
There are also several effluent sites scattered along this river at Malton, Stamford Bridge, Elvington, Wheldrake and Bubwith.

[[Víctor Galíndez]]
CATEGORIES: 1948 births, 1980 deaths, People from Buenos Aires Province, Argentine boxers, Road accident deaths in Argentina, World light-heavyweight boxing champions, World Boxing Association champions, International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees

Víctor Emilio Galíndez (November 2, 1948 in Vedia – October 25, 1980 in Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires) was an Argentine boxer who was the third Latin American to win the world Light Heavyweight championship, after Puerto Rico's José Torres and Venezuela's Vicente Rondon. 
Galíndez was born in Vedia in the Leandro N. Alem Partido of the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. He aspired to become both a boxer and a stock car pilot since an early age, but he was more interested in boxing. As an amateur, he compiled a winning record and participated in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, where he lost in a preliminary round bout. A year earlier he claimed the silver medal at the 1967 Pan American Games.
Galíndez then turned professional, and on May 10 of 1969, he debuted as a paid fighter with a win over Ramon Ruiz by a knockout in four at Buenos Aires. After one more win, he faced Adolfo Cejas in Azul, Argentina, in a fight which resulted in a ten round draw. 
In 1970, Galíndez had 10 fights, a span during which he went 5-3-1, with one no contest. He suffered his first loss, at the hands of Juan Aguilar, by a decision in ten, and had a second and third fight with Aguilar, of which the second ended in a first round no contest, and the second in another Aguilar decision win. He began his five fight rivalry with Jorge Ahumada knocking Ahumada out in five rounds, and lost the Argentine Light Heavyweight title with a twelve round decision defeat against Avenamar Peralta.
He and Peralta had an immediate, non-title rematch in 1971, and Galíndez won by a ten round decision. 1971 was a year of rematches for Galíndez, the only new boxer he met that year being Pedro Rimovsky, and he too, had a rematch with Galíndez before that year was over. He lost to Ahumada in the second of the five fights between them, by a decision in Mendoza, Argentina, then beat him in fight three by a knockout in nine, and in fight four by a knockout in six, both the third and fourth fight being held in Buenos Aires. He and Rimovsky had a first round no contest in their first bout, and drew over the ten round distance in the rematch, and then Galíndez had two more fights with Peralta, losing by a knockout in nine and a decision in 10.
In 1973, Galíndez had eight fights, winning seven and drawing one. He was finally able to obtain Argentina's Light Heavyweight title, by beating Aguilar by a decision in twelve. He beat Aguilar once again, by a knockout in six, and he also beat Eddie Owens, Eddie Duncan and Raul Loyola, the latter being beaten twice, one time defending his Argentine title.
He began 1974 with a step up in class, meeting former world title challenger Ray Anderson, beating him by a knockout in two. After six more consecutive wins, he was given his first shot at a world title, facing Len Hutchins for the WBA's vacant world Light Heavyweight championship. Galíndez then joined Torres and Rondon as the only Hispanic Light Heavyweight world champions in history, and Carlos Monzón as the only Argentine world champions of that era, with a TKO of Hutchins in the thirteenth round to become the WBA's world Light Heavyweight champion. 
Ironically, Galíndez, who never fought outside Argentina before becoming a world champion, became a traveling fighter after that. After he beat Johnny Griffin in Buenos Aires by knockout in six in a non title bout, it was off to South Africa, for his first international fight, which was, at the same time, his first world title defense. He beat Pierre Fourie there by a decision. Next was Las Vegas, for his first fight in the United States, another non title affair. He knocked out Ray Elson in eight there. Next stop was the Madison Square Garden in New York, where he and arch-rival Ahumada met for a fifth time, this time with the world title on the line. After beating Ahumada by a decision in 15, Galíndez returned to South Africa, where he once again beat Fourie by decision in 15. 
1976 saw a trip to Norway, where he beat Harald Skog by a knockout in three to retain the title, and to Denmark, where he beat Jesse Burnett by a decision in ten in a non tite affair. Then came a third trip to South Africa, where he knocked out challenger Richie Kates in the 15th and last round, and, after a fight with Billy Douglas in Buenos Aires, (a win by decision in ten) he found himself in South Africa once again, where he beat Kosie Smith by a decision in fifteen to once again, retain the title.
After beginning 1977 by beating Guillermo Aquirrezabala by a knockout in four in Mendoza, he and Kates had a rematch in Rome, Italy, where Galíndez once again beat Kates by decision over 15. Next, the Argentine champion and challenger Álvaro Yaqui López faced Galíndez in a 15 round title bout, once again in Italy, and Galíndez retained the title by a decision in Rome. Galíndez' last fight of '77 took him to Italy for a third time, and he beat future world champion Eddie Mustafa Muhammad (then Eddie Gregory) by a decision in fifteen.
In 1978, Galíndez went to Italy again, retaining the title with a fifteen round decision in a rematch with Lopez, and then he made a series of non title bouts in Argentina before he went on the road again, this time losing his title to Mike Rossman by a knockout in 13, in the same undercard where Muhammad Ali recovered the world Heavyweight title for the third time by beating Leon Spinks at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. 
After his first fight in 1979, beating Roberto Aguilar by a knockout in six back home, he and Rossman were supposed to have a rematch in February of that year, but Galíndez refused to fight, arguing that the judges selected for the rematch would probably favor Rossman. However, the rematch did come off later that year, and Galíndez recovered the world championship, once again in New Orleans, knocking Rossman out in 10 rounds. This time, however, he wouldn't last long as king of the Light Heavyweights, and he lost the title in his first defense, by a knockout in 11 to Marvin Johnson, a boxer who would later join Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson and Carlos De León among others as one of the few boxers to be world champions three times in the same category. The fight with Johnson also took place in New Orleans. 
After losing a rematch with Burnett in 1980 by a decision in twelve in Anaheim, California, Galíndez was forced to retire because of two operations to repair his detached retinas, and then he tried to pursue his other dream of becoming a stock-car race pilot. On October 25 of that year, he participated in what would be his first and last Turismo Carretera race. After going to the pit for repairs, Galíndez was struck by a car that lost control and killed instantly while in the waiting area.
He had a boxing record of 52 wins, 9 losses and 4 draws with 2 no contests, and 34 wins by knockout.
In 2002, Galíndez was inducted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame.

The island came to prominence in the late 18th century after a visit by Sir Joseph Banks. He and his fellow-travellers extolled the natural beauty of the basalt columns in general and of the island's main sea cavern, which Banks renamed 'Fingal's Cave'. Their visit was followed by those of many other prominent personalities throughout the next two centuries, including Queen Victoria and Felix Mendelssohn. The latter's Hebrides Overture brought further fame to the island, which was by then uninhabited. It is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland.

Wrawby Postmill is a windmill in the unitary authority of North Lincolnshire, England,  at Wrawby near Brigg. It was built between 1760 and 1790 to serve the Elsham Hall estate.  The mill originally had four common sails, but through most of its working life had the popular combination of power with flexibility from two common and two spring sails.   It was working until the 1940s finishing with four spring sails, before becoming derelict.  After threats of demolition, it was acquired and restored in 1965 by Wrawby Windmill Preservation Society.  Recent maintenance saw a return to the mixed sail types in 2008, with funding support from the SPAB Mill Repairs Fund and donations from local residents.
It is the last post mill in the north of England, and is open to the public on Bank Holiday Mondays from Easter to August, and the last Sundays in June and July.  Milling is for demonstration only, there is a small museum of milling tools and souvenirs and refreshments are usually for sale.  Group visits are welcome at other times.

"Howl" is a poem written by Allen Ginsberg in 1955, published as part of his 1956 collection of poetry titled Howl and Other Poems. 
Ginsberg began work on "Howl" as early as 1954. In the Paul Blackburn Tape Archive at the University of California, San Diego, Ginsberg can be heard reading early drafts of his poem to his fellow writing associates. "Howl" is considered to be one of the great works of American literature.Bill Savage (2008). Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" and the Paperback Revolution. Poets.org, Academy of American Poets. Jonah Raski (2006). American Scream: Allen Ginsberg's Howl and the Making of the Beat Generation. University of California Press. 223. It came to be associated with the group of writers known as the Beat Generation, which included Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs.
There is no foundation to the myth that "Howl" was written as a performance piece and later published by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Books. This myth was perpetuated by Ferlinghetti as part of the defense's case during the poem's obscenity trial, as detailed below. Upon the poem's release, Ferlinghetti and the bookstore's manager, Shigeyoshi Murao, were charged with disseminating obscene literature, and both were arrested. On October 3, 1957, Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that the poem was not obscene.Morgan, Bill and Joyce Peters. Howl on Trial.(2006) p. xiii.

Aguirre, the Wrath of God ([tpl]lang-de|Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes[/tpl]), known in the UK as Aguirre, Wrath of God, is a 1972 West German New Wave adventure art film written and directed by Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski stars in the title role. The soundtrack was composed and performed by German progressive/Krautrock band Popol Vuh. The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Orinoco and Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. Using a minimalist story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although based loosely on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, the film's story line is, as Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release, a work of imagination.  Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by Gaspar de Carvajal's account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film. Other accounts state that the expedition went into the jungles but never returned to civilization.
Aguirre was the first of five collaborations between Herzog and the volatile Kinski. The director and the actor had differing views as to how the role should be played, and they clashed throughout the film's production, while Kinski's tantrums terrorized both the crew and the local natives who assisted the production.  The production was shot entirely on location, and was fraught with difficulties.  Filming took place in the Peruvian rainforest on the Amazon River during an arduous five-week period, shooting on tributaries of the Ucayali region.  The cast and crew climbed mountains, cut through heavy vines to open routes to the various jungle locations, and rode treacherous river rapids on rafts built by natives.
Aguirre opened to widespread critical acclaim, and quickly developed a large international cult film following. It was given an extensive arthouse theatrical release in the United States in 1977, and remains one of the director's best known films. Several critics have declared the film a masterpiece, and it has appeared on Time magazine's list of "All Time 100 Best Films".  Aguirre’s visual style and narrative elements  had a strong influence on Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now.

[[Nyquist plot]]
CATEGORIES: Plots (graphics), Signal processing, Classical control

A Nyquist plot is a parametric plot of a frequency response used in automatic control and signal processing.  The most common use of Nyquist plots is for assessing the stability of a system with feedback.  In Cartesian coordinates, the real part of the transfer function is plotted on the X axis. The imaginary part is plotted on the Y axis. The frequency is swept as a parameter, resulting in a plot per frequency.  Alternatively, in polar coordinates, the gain of the transfer function is plotted as the radial coordinate, while the phase of the transfer function is plotted as the angular coordinate.  The Nyquist plot is named after Harry Nyquist, a former engineer at Bell Laboratories.

Firefly is an American space western drama television series created by writer and director Joss Whedon, under his Mutant Enemy Productions label. Whedon served as an executive producer, along with Tim Minear.  The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system, and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a "Firefly-class" spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity. Whedon pitched the show as "nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things".[tpl]cite web |url= http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/F/Firefly/2002/07/22/734323.html |title=Firefly series ready for liftoff |last=Brioux |first=Bill |publisher=jam.canoe.ca |accessdate=December 10, 2006[/tpl]
The show explores the lives of a group of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war and others who now make a living on the outskirts of society, as part of the pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system. In this future, the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures. According to Whedon's vision, "nothing will change in the future: technology will advance, but we will still have the same political, moral, and ethical problems as today".Whedon, Serenity: Relighting the Firefly, DVD extra

[[Johann Evangelist Haydn]]
CATEGORIES: 1743 births, 1805 deaths, Austrian tenors, Joseph Haydn

Johann Evangelist Haydn (December 23, 1743 – May 10, 1805) was a tenor singer of the classical era; the younger brother of the composers Joseph Haydn and Michael Haydn.  He was often called "Hansl", a diminutive form of "Johann".
Johann was the eleventh child of Mathias Haydn and Anna Maria Koller Haydn (Joseph was second, and Michael sixth).  His career training may have been mixed.  According to Albert Christoph Dies, an early biographer of Joseph Haydn, Johann followed his older brothers in serving as a choirboy in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.Dies 1810, 86  However, Rosemary Hughes indicatesHughes 1970, 37-38 that Johann was also trained in the profession of his father Mathias, namely that of wheelwright.
Hughes describes Johann as "delicate and quite incapable of carrying on his father's business."  In 1763, Johann's father died, leaving a will that specified an early financial distribution to Johann, prior to the formal division of the estate; as Jones suggests, this indicates that he was not yet able to support himself.Jones 2009 In 1765, after his stepmother had remarried, Johann left home and joined his brother Joseph, who by this time was employed in Eisenstadt as Kapellmeister to the Esterházy family.  Joseph took his younger brother into his home and found him a position as a tenor in the Esterházys' church choir.  Johann worked without pay, supported by his brother, for six years, after which he drew a small salary, which Joseph supplemented.Hughes 1970, 38
Johann was apparently not a very accomplished singer.  The composer Antonio Salieri once remarked of a pupil that she "sang through the nose like Hansl Haydn".Hughes 1970, 38 Perhaps as a result, his services to the Esterházy family were limited to church music; he was not recruited to perform in any of the many operas directed by Joseph starting in the 1770s.  Johann did some teaching and may have been pressed into service from time to time as an emergency music copyist.Jones 2009
It is possible that Johann was paid as a singer as a favor to Joseph; that Haydn's employer at the time (Prince Nikolaus Esterházy) esteemed Haydn's services enough to make such arrangements is suggested by a similar act later on, in which he kept on the payroll another mediocre singer, Haydn's mistress Luigia Polzelli.
Johann briefly lost his job in 1775 when some "minor infraction" (Robbins Landon) brought upon him the wrath of Prince Nikolaus's estates director, the short-tempered Peter Ludwig von Rahier. The position was restored at Joseph Haydn's intervention.Robbins Landon (2009, 322)  Johann was again unemployed from 1790 (when Prince Anton Esterházy succeeded Nikolaus and abolished most of the family's musical establishment) until 1795 (when Anton's successor Nikolaus II revived it).  Nothing is known about what Johann did during this time.  Following his reinstatement, he continued in the service of the Esterházy family for the remainder of his life, dying in Eisenstadt at the age of 63.

Shirley Hardie Jackson (December 14, 1916 – August 8, 1965) was an American author. She was a popular writer in her time, and her work has received increasing attention from literary critics in recent years. She has influenced such writers as Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Nigel Kneale, and Richard Matheson.[tpl]cite web|last=Murphy |first=Bernice | date=2004-08-31 |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=2326 |title= Shirley Jackson (1916-1965) |work=The Literary Encyclopedia |accessdate=2006-05-09 [/tpl]
She is best known for the short story The Lottery (1948), which suggests a secret, sinister underside to bucolic small-town America. In her critical biography of Jackson, Lenemaja Friedman notes that when The Lottery was published in the June 26, 1948, issue of The New Yorker, it received a response that "no New Yorker story had ever received". Hundreds of letters poured in that were characterized by, as Jackson put it, "bewilderment, speculation, and old-fashioned abuse".Friedman, Lenemaja. "Social Evil: The Lottery," Shirley Jackson. Twayne Publishers, 1975.[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]
In the July 22, 1948, issue of the San Francisco Chronicle, Jackson offered the following in response to persistent queries from her readers about her intentions:
 
 Explaining just what I had hoped the story to say is very difficult. I suppose, I hoped, by setting a particularly brutal ancient rite in the present and in my own village to shock the story's readers with a graphic dramatization of the pointless violence and general inhumanity in their own lives.

Jackson's husband, the literary critic Stanley Edgar Hyman, wrote in his preface to a posthumous anthology of her work that "she consistently refused to be interviewed, to explain or promote her work in any fashion, or to take public stands and be the pundit of the Sunday supplements. She believed that her books would speak for her clearly enough over the years." Hyman insisted the darker aspects of Jackson's works were not, as some critics claimed, the product of "personal, even neurotic, fantasies", but that Jackson intended, as "a sensitive and faithful anatomy of our times, fitting symbols for our distressing world of the concentration camp and the Bomb", to mirror humanity's Cold War-era fears. Jackson may even have taken pleasure in the subversive impact of her work, as evidenced by Hyman's statement that she "was always proud that the Union of South Africa banned The Lottery, and she felt that they at least understood the story".[tpl]cite book |last=Hyman | first=Stanley Edgar |editor-first=Stanley Edgar, ed| editor-last=Hyman |title=The Magic of Shirley Jackson |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |year=1966 |chapter=Preface[/tpl]

[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]

CATEGORIES: United States equal protection case law, 1964 in United States case law, United States Supreme Court cases, United States electoral redistricting case law

Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964) was a U.S. Supreme Court case involving  U.S. Congressional districts in the state of Georgia. The Court issued its ruling on February 17, 1964. This decision requires each state to draw its U.S. Congressional districts so that they are approximately equal in population.
Nationally, this decision effectively reduced the representation of rural districts in the U.S. Congress. Particularly, the Court held that the population differences among Georgia's congressional districts were so great as to violate the Constitution.
In reaching this landmark decision, the Supreme Court asserted that Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution requires that representatives shall be chosen "by the People of the several States" and shall be "apportioned among the several States...according to their respective Numbers...." These words, the Court held, mean that "as nearly as practicable one man's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another's."
Wesberry and the Court's later "one person, one vote" decisions had an extraordinary impact on the makeup of the House, on the content of public policy, and on electoral politics in general. However, these "one person, one vote" rules do not prevent and have not prevented gerrymandering.
A related case, Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), held that seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must also, to satisfy the Equal Protection Clause, represent districts as equal in population as practicably possible. The federal Senate was unaffected since the Constitution explicitly grants each state two senators.

The script was initially named after the publication, but later came to be known as hangul. It was created so that the common people illiterate in hanja could accurately and easily read and write the Korean language. It was announced in Volume 102 of the Annals of King Sejong, and its formal supposed publication date, October 9, 1446, is now Hangul Day in South Korea.

Knoppix, or KNOPPIX ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|n|ɒ|p|ɪ|k|s[/tpl] [tpl]respell|KNOP|iks[/tpl]),Two Weughty Questions on Debian newsgroup post is an operating system based on Debian designed to be run directly from a CD / DVD (Live CD) or a USB flash drive (Live USB), one of the first of its kind for any operating system. Knoppix was developed by Linux consultant Klaus Knopper. When starting a program, it is loaded from the removable medium and decompressed into a RAM drive. The decompression is transparent and on-the-fly.

[[Dawn Summers]]

CATEGORIES: Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters, Child characters in television, Fictional vampire hunters, Fictional characters introduced in 2000

Dawn Summers is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and introduced by Marti Noxon and David Fury on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, portrayed by Michelle Trachtenberg. She made her debut in the premiere episode of the show's fifth season, and subsequently appeared in every episode of its remaining three seasons. Within the series, Dawn is the little sister of main character Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a girl chosen by fate to be a vampire Slayer. Whedon introduced Dawn to the series because he wanted to introduce a character with whom Buffy could have an intensely emotional non-romantic relationship.
After years of foreshadowing, Dawn was introduced at the start of the fifth season as part of a large in-story retcon: characters accepted Dawn's presence as if she had always been there, and as if Buffy always had a sister, with only the audience aware that this was not the case. As the series went on, the significance of Dawn's arrival is revealed to the series' other characters and they come to understand that she has not always been Buffy's sister, or indeed a sentient being; Dawn had originally been the mystical 'key' to unlocking dimensions, and was made into Buffy's sister so the Slayer would protect her. Dawn is, however, a real girl, Buffy's biological sister, and has real memories of her fictional childhood. She struggles in a very human way when she discovers the truth about her origins, and later endures problems with self-harm and kleptomania. The show's sixth and seventh seasons, as well as its canonical comic book continuation, follow Dawn's journey towards adulthood.
Dawn was included in TV Guide[tpl]'s[/tpl] list of The Most Loathed TV Characters.[tpl]cite web|title=The Most Loathed TV Characters Pictures, Dawn Photos|url=http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Loathed-TV-Characters-1049721/1051122|work=TV Guide|accessdate=September 13, 2012[/tpl] Similarly, Entertainment Weekly named her one of the "21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever".[tpl]cite web|title=21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20586339,00.html#21144623|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=April 12, 2013|date=April 1, 2013[/tpl]

Eta Canis Majoris (η CMa, η Canis Majoris) is a star in the constellation Canis Major.  It has the traditional name Aludra. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
The name Aludra originates from the Arabic: عذرا al-‘aðrā "the virgin".  This star, along with ε CMa (Adhara), δ CMa (Wezen) and ο2 CMa (Thanih al Adzari), were Al ʽAdhārā (ألعذاري), the Virgins.

The Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army.Knight (1992, 2002), p. 8. Frere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British governmentSpiers, p. 41Ian Knight, Zulu War, Osprey, 2004, p. 9, "By late 1878 Frere had manipulated a diplomatic crisis with the Zulus..." and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an ultimatum on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king Cetshwayo with which the Zulu king could not comply.Colenso, pp. 261–262. Also: Ian Knight, Zulu War, Osprey, 2004, p. 11, "... an ultimatum with which, Frere knew, they could not possibly comply." Cetshwayo did not comply and Bartle Frere sent Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand.Morris, pp. 291–292 The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including a stunning opening victory by the Zulu at Isandlwana, as well as for being a landmark in the timeline of imperialism in the region. The war eventually resulted in a British victory and the end of the Zulu nation's independence.

[[Manglish]]
CATEGORIES: English-based pidgins and creoles, Manglish, Languages of Malaysia

Manglish (or sometimes Malglish or Mangled English) is an English-based creole spoken in Malaysia. It is also the English spoken by Malayalees of Kerala state in India who have not had good English education.Urban DictionaryJust Jo
The vocabulary of Manglish consists of words originating from English, Malay, Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tamil, and to a lesser extent various other European languages, while Manglish syntax resembles southern varieties of Chinese. Also, elements of American and Australian slang have come through from imported television series.Lingua et Linguistica 1.1
The Malaysian Manglish is sometimes known as Rojak or Bahasa Rojak, but it differs from the Rojak language by the usage of English as the base language. The East Coast versions (Kelantan and Terengganu) of Manglish may differ greatly, as their accent of Malay and the jargon are particularly alien to regular Malaysian (West Coast) speakers. Such is shown evidently in the film 'Baik Punya Cilok' where a character spoke in an authentic Terengganu Manglish.
Manglish in the West coast of West Malaysia is very similar (and often identical) to Singlish.

[[Intensive pig farming]]

CATEGORIES: Pig farming, Industrial agriculture, Animal rights, Meat industry

Intensive pig farming is a subset of pig farming and of Industrial animal agriculture, all of which are types of animal husbandry, in which domestic pigs are raised up to slaughter weight.  These operations are known as AFO or CAFO in the U.S.  In this system of pig production, grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds, whilst pregnant sows are housed in sow stalls (gestation crates) or pens and give birth in farrowing crates.
The use of sow stalls for pregnant sows has resulted in lower birth production costs; however, this practice has led to more significant animal welfare concerns.  Many of the world’s largest producers of pigs (US, Canada, Denmark, Mexico) use sow stalls, but some nations (e.g., the UK) and some US states (e.g., Florida, Arizona, and California) have banned their use.

[[British and Malaysian English differences]]
CATEGORIES: English dialects, Language comparison

This article outlines the differences between Malaysian English, Malaysian Colloquial English (Manglish) Lingua et Linguistica 1.1  and British English, which for the purposes of this article is assumed to be the form of English spoken in south east England, used by the British Government, the BBC and widely understood in other parts of the United Kingdom.
Malaysian English (MyE), formally known as Malaysian Standard English (MySE), is a form of English used and spoken in Malaysia as a second language. Malaysian English should not be confused with Malaysian Colloquial English, which is famously known as Manglish, a portmanteau of the word Malay and English, or Street English.
Manglish can be likened to an English-based pidgin language or a Patois and it is usually barely understandable to most speakers of English outside of Malaysia except in the case of Singapore where a similar colloquial form of English is spoken known as Singlish. Though very similar, Manglish today receives more Malay influences while Singlish more Chinese.

Condoleezza Rice ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|n|d|ə|ˈ|l|iː|z|ə[/tpl]; born November 14, 1954) is an American political scientist and diplomat. She served as the 66th  United States Secretary of State, and was the second person to hold that office in the administration of President George W. Bush. Rice was the first female African-American secretary of state, as well as the second African American secretary of state (after Colin Powell), and the second female secretary of state (after Madeleine Albright). Rice was President Bush's National Security Advisor during his first term, making her the first woman to serve in that position. Before joining the Bush administration, she was a professor of political science at Stanford University where she served as Provost from 1993 to 1999. Rice also served on the National Security Council as the Soviet and Eastern Europe Affairs Advisor to President George H.W. Bush during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German reunification.
Following her confirmation as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered the policy of Transformational Diplomacy directed toward expanding the number of responsible democratic governments in the world and especially in the Greater Middle East. That policy faced challenges as Hamas captured a popular majority in Palestinian elections, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained authoritarian systems with U.S. support. She has logged more miles traveling than any other Secretary of State. While in the position, she chaired the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board of directors.
In March 2009, Rice returned to Stanford University as a political science professor and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/condoleezzarice/ |title=Condi Rice website at Stanford University |publisher=Fsi.stanford.edu |accessdate=May 27, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Condoleezza Rice |url=http://www.hoover.org/bios/rice.html |title=Condi Rice website at the Hoover Institution |publisher=Hoover.org |accessdate=May 27, 2009[/tpl] In September 2010, Rice became a faculty member of the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a director of its Global Center for Business and the Economy.[tpl]cite web|last=Gloeckler|first=Geoff|title= Getting In Condoleezza Rice To Join Stanford B-School Faculty In September|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/blogs/mba_admissions/archives/2010/08/condoleezza_rice_to_join_stanford_gsb_faculty_in_september.html|work=Business Week|publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=September 15, 2010[/tpl]

[[Strategy of Technology]]
CATEGORIES: Cold War, Space weapons

The Strategy of Technology doctrine involves a country using its advantage in technology to create and deploy weapons of sufficient power and numbers so as to overawe or beggar its opponents, forcing them to spend their limited resources on developing hi-tech countermeasures and straining their economy.
In 1983, The US Defense Intelligence Agency established a classified program, Project Socrates, to develop a national technology strategy policy. This program was designed to maintain the US military strength relative to the Soviet Union, while also maintaining the economic and military strength required to keep the US as a superpower.
The Strategy of Technology is described in the eponymous book written by Stefan T. Possony, Jerry Pournelle and Francis X. Kane (Col., USAF, and ret.) in 1970.http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/124799?page=frame&url=http%3A%2F%2Fuwashington.worldcat.org%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dno%253A124799%26checksum%3D0ef8be86995c0afb890e2ce788f77daf&title=University+of+Washington+Libraries&linktype=opac&detail=WAU%3AUniversity+of+Washington+Libraries%3AAcademic  This was required reading in the U.S. service academies, the Air War College, and the National War College during the latter half of the Cold War."The First Essential of Airpower: The Case for Air Force Laboratories," Air & Space Power Journal, Maj Daniel E.

James Emory "Jimmie" Foxx (October 22, 1907 – July 21, 1967), nicknamed "Double X" and "The Beast", was an American baseball first baseman who played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball for four different teams. His most productive years were with the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox, where he was a formidable power hitter, hitting 30 or more home runs in 12 consecutive seasons and driving in more than 100 runs in 13 consecutive years.
Foxx became the second player in Major League Baseball history to hit 500 career home runs, after Babe Ruth. Attaining that plateau at age 32 years 336 days, he held the record for youngest to reach 500 for sixty-eight years, until superseded by Alex Rodriguez in 2007. His three career Most Valuable Player awards are tied for second all-time. Foxx was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951.[tpl]cite web|url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/foxx-jimmie|title=Jimmie Foxx|publisher=Baseball Hall of Fame|accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl]

Donburi meals are served in oversized rice bowls also called donburi. Donburi are sometimes called sweetened or savory stews on rice.
The simmering sauce varies according to season, ingredients, region, and taste. A typical sauce might consist of dashi flavored with soy sauce and mirin. Proportions vary, but there is normally three to four times as much dashi as soy sauce and mirin. For oyakodon, Tsuji (1980) recommends dashi flavored with light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and sugar. For gyūdon, Tsuji recommends water flavored with dark soy sauce and mirin.

However, it was often used by the news media and Allied soldiers as a name for all German units in North Africa. The reputation of the Afrika Korps is tied with that of its first commander, Erwin Rommel.

Reactionaries are considered to be one end of a political spectrum whose opposite pole is radicalism, though reactionary ideologies may be themselves radical.

[[Dual (grammatical number)]]

CATEGORIES: Grammatical number

Dual (abbreviated [tpl]sc|du[/tpl]) is a grammatical number that some languages use in addition to singular and plural. When a noun or pronoun appears in dual form, it is interpreted as referring to precisely two of the entities (objects or persons) identified by the noun or pronoun. Verbs can also have dual agreement forms in these languages.
The dual number existed in Proto-Indo-European, persisted in many of the now extinct ancient Indo-European languages that descended from it— Ancient Greek and Gothic for example—and can still be found in a few modern Indo-European languages such as Scottish Gaelic, Slovenian, and Sorbian of which only Slovenian is an official language and spoken in majority of the country. Among ancient languages, Sanskrit, while not many people speak it as their primary tongue, is among the official languages of India and uses dual forms across the board: for nouns, verbs, adjectives. Many more modern Indo-European languages show residual traces of the dual, as in the English distinctions both vs. all, either vs. any, neither vs. none, and so on.
Many Semitic languages also have dual number. For instance, in Arabic all nouns can have singular, plural, or dual forms; for non-broken plurals,  masculine plural nouns end with [tpl]lang|ar|ون[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|-ūn[/tpl] and feminine plural nouns end with [tpl]lang|ar|ات[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|-āt[/tpl], whilst [tpl]lang|ar|ان[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|-ān[/tpl], is added to the end of a noun to indicate that it is dual (even among nouns that have broken plurals).

Anthan states, "My credentials for covering agriculture were established in my first several weeks working for the Des Moines Register when I was assigned to cover the Iowa State Fair.  And immediately--which is a treasured assignment, since the book “State Fair” was written by a Des Moines Register reporter--and I immediately identified in the caption some purebred swine as Herefords.  It was the only time in my 40-some-year career at the Des Moines Register that I heard the words, “Stop the presses”."

[[Appendectomy]]

CATEGORIES: Surgical removal procedures, General surgery, Digestive system surgery

An appendectomy (sometimes called appendisectomy or appendicectomy) (British English) is the surgical removal of the vermiform appendix. This procedure is normally performed as an emergency procedure, when the patient is suffering from acute appendicitis. In the absence of surgical facilities, intravenous antibiotics are used to delay or prevent the onset of sepsis; it is now recognized that many cases will resolve when treated perioperatively. In some cases the appendicitis resolves completely; more often, an inflammatory mass forms around the appendix, causing transruptural flotation. This is a relative contraindication to surgery.
Appendectomy may be performed laparoscopically (this is called minimally invasive surgery) or as an open operation. Laparoscopy is often used if the diagnosis is in doubt, or if it is desirable to hide the scars in the umbilicus or in the pubic hair line. Recovery may be a little quicker with laparoscopic surgery; the procedure is more expensive and resource-intensive than open surgery and generally takes a little longer, with the (low in most patients) additional risks associated with pneumoperitoneum (inflating the abdomen with gas). Advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires a lower midline laparotomy.

CATEGORIES: Maneuver tactics, Military strategy

The pincer movement, or double envelopment, is a military maneuver in which forces simultaneously attack both flanks (sides) of an enemy formation. The name comes from visualizing the action as the split attacking forces "pinching" the enemy.
The pincer movement typically occurs when opposing forces advance towards the center of an army that responds by moving its outside forces to the enemy's flanks to surround it. At the same time, a second layer of pincers may attack on the more distant flanks to keep reinforcements from the target units.

The Committee of Public Safety ([tpl]lang-fr|Comité de salut public[/tpl]), created in March 1793 by the National Convention and then restructured in July 1793, formed the de facto executive government in France during the Reign of Terror (1793–1794), a stage of the French Revolution. The Committee of Public Safety succeeded the previous Committee of General Defence (established in January 1793) and assumed its role of protecting the newly established republic against foreign attacks and internal rebellion. As a wartime measure, the Committee—composed at first of nine, and later of twelve members—was given broad supervisory powers over military, judicial, and legislative efforts. It was formed as an administrative body to supervise and expedite the work of the executive bodies of the Convention and of the government ministers appointed by the Convention. As the Committee tried to meet the dangers of a coalition of European nations and counter-revolutionary forces within the country, it became more and more powerful.
In July 1793, following the defeat at the Convention of the moderate Republicans (or "Girondists"), the prominent leaders of the radical Jacobins—Maximilien Robespierre, Saint-Just, and Georges Couthon—were added to the Committee. The power of the Committee peaked between August 1793 and July 1794, under the leadership of Robespierre. In December 1793, the Convention formally conferred executive power upon the Committee, and Robespierre established a virtual dictatorship.
The execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety and the excesses of the Reign of Terror. This is known as the Thermidorian Reaction, as Robespierre's fall from power occurred during the Revolutionary month of Thermidor. The Committee's influence diminished, and it was disestablished in 1795.

A principal figure in Polish Romanticism, he is counted  one of Poland's "Three Bards" ("Trzej Wieszcze") and is widely regarded as Poland's greatest poet. He is also considered one of the greatest Slavic and European poets and has been dubbed a "Slavic bard". A leading Romantic dramatist, he has been compared in Poland and Europe to Byron and Goethe.
He is known chiefly for the poetic drama Dziady (Forefathers' Eve) and the national epic poem Pan Tadeusz. His other influential works include Konrad Wallenrod and Grażyna. All these served as inspiration for uprisings against the three imperial powers that had partitioned the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of existence.
Mickiewicz was born in the Russian-partitioned territories of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which had been part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was active in the struggle to win independence for his home region.  After, as a consequence, spending five years exiled to central Russia, in 1829 he succeeded in leaving the Russian Empire and, like many of his compatriots, lived out the rest of his life abroad.  He settled first in Rome, then in Paris, where for a little over three years he lectured on Slavic literature at the Collège de France.  He died, probably of cholera, at Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire, where he had gone to help organize Polish and Jewish forces to fight Russia in the Crimean War.
In 1890 his remains were repatriated from Montmorency, Val-d'Oise, in France, to Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, Poland.

Known to us mainly from the 28th and 29th Discourses of Dio Chrysostom,Melankomas is also mentioned in Themistius, Orationes 10 (=165 Dinsdorf) and alluded to by Eustathius. Michael B. Poliakoff, "Melankomas, ἐκ κλίμακο, and Greek Boxing", The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 108, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 511. in which that writer uses his life as a canvas for a discussion of the ideal athlete and the ideal man, Dio praises his athleticism, good looks, and brave heart. With regard to his boxing, claims for him a unique style: he would totally avoid the punches of the other boxer without throwing any himself. Dio says he never lost a match nor was struck by an opponent. Themistius reports that the emperor Titus was his lover ([tpl]lang|el|erastes[/tpl]).
Some scholars believe Melankomas to have been a real person, others that he was an invention of Dio's; there is nothing allowing a firm conclusion either way.
Melankomas was mentioned in a second-season episode of Sports Night as a contender for "Athlete of the Millennium."

Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery favoured a single thrust north over the branches of the Lower Rhine river, allowing the British 2nd Army to bypass the German Siegfried Line and attack the Ruhr. To this end, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden on 17 September. Paratroopers were dropped in the Netherlands to secure key bridges and towns along the Allied axis of advance. Farthest north, the British 1st Airborne Division, supported by men of the Glider Pilot Regiment and the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn. Initially expecting a walkover, British XXX Corps planned to reach the British airborne forces within two to three days.
The British forces landed some distance from their objectives and were quickly hampered by unexpected resistance – especially from elements of the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions. Only a small force was able to reach the Arnhem road bridge while the main body of the division was halted on the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, XXX Corps was unable to advance north as quickly as anticipated and failed to relieve the airborne troops according to schedule. After four days, the small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed and the rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket north of the river – where they could not be sufficiently reinforced by the Poles or XXX Corps when they arrived on the southern bank, nor by the RAF's resupply flights. After nine days of fighting, the shattered remains of the airborne forces were withdrawn in Operation Berlin.
With no secure bridges over the Nederrijn, the Allies were unable to advance further and the front line stabilised south of Arnhem. The 1st Airborne Division had lost nearly three-quarters of its strength and did not see combat again.

[[Bank holiday]]

CATEGORIES: Public holidays in the United Kingdom, British culture, Irish culture, Holidays

A bank holiday is a public holiday in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth countries, other European countries such as Switzerland, and a colloquialism for a public holiday in Ireland. There is no automatic right to time off on these days, although banks close and the majority of the working population is granted time off work or extra pay for working on these days, depending on their contract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741 |title=Bank holidays and British Summer Time : Directgov - Government, citizens and rights |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110515020958/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741| archivedate= 15 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The first official bank holidays were the four days named in the Bank Holidays Act 1871, but today the term is colloquially (albeit incorrectly) used for public holidays which are not officially bank holidays, for example Good Friday and Christmas Day.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays |title=UK bank holidays - GOV.UK |publisher=gov.uk |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=9 April 2014[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1853 births, 1914 deaths, People from Loiret, French dramatists and playwrights, French monarchists, Members of the Académie française, French literary critics, University of Grenoble faculty

François Élie Jules Lemaître (27 April 1853 – 4 August 1914) was a French critic and dramatist.
Lemaître was born in Vennecy, Loiret.  He became a professor at the University of Grenoble in 1883, but was already well known for his literary criticism, and in 1884 he resigned his position to devote his time to literature. He succeeded Jean-Jacques Weiss as drama critic of the Journal des Débats, and subsequently filled the same office on the Revue des Deux Mondes. His literary studies were collected under the title of Les Contemporains (7 series, 1886-1899), and his dramatic feuilletons as impressions de théàtre (10 series, 1888-1898).
His sketches of modern authors show great insight and unexpected judgment as well as gaiety and originality of expression. He published two volumes of poetry: Les Médaillons (1880) and Petites orientales (1883); also some volumes of contes, among them En marge des vieux livres (1905). His plays are:
He was admitted to the French Academy on 16 January 1896. His political views were defined in La Campagne nationaliste (1902), lectures delivered in the provinces by him and by Godefroy Cavaignac. He conducted a nationalist campaign in the Écho de Paris, and was for some time president of the Ligue de la Patrie Française, but resigned in 1904, and dedicated the rest of his life to writing.  He died in Tavers, aged 61.

[[List of political parties in the Netherlands]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of political parties by country, Political parties in the Netherlands, Netherlands politics-related lists, Lists of organisations based in the Netherlands

This article lists political parties in the Netherlands.  The Netherlands has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which any one party has little chance of gaining power alone, and parties often work with each other to form coalition governments.
The lower house of the legislature, the House of Representatives, is elected by a national party-list system of proportional representation.  There is no threshold for getting a seat, making it possible for a party to get a seat with only two-thirds percent of the vote—roughly one seat for every 60,000 votes.  Since this system was implemented in 1918, no party has even approached the seats needed for an outright majority.  However, there is a broad consensus on the basic principles of the political system, and all parties must adjust their goals to some extent in order to have a realistic chance at being part of the government.

[[Domain name registry]]
CATEGORIES: Domain name system, Internet governance, Public records, Internet databases

A domain name registry is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that allow third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS.
A registry operator, sometimes called a network information center (NIC) maintains all administrative data of the domain and generates a zone file which contains the addresses of the nameservers for each domain. Each registrar is an organization that manages the registration of domain names within the domains  for which it is responsible,  controls the policies of domain name allocation, and technically operates its domain.  It may also fulfill the function of a domain name registrar, or may delegate that function to other entities.[tpl]cite web | title = ICann.org Glossary | url = http://www.icann.org/en/general/glossary.htm | accessdate = 2009-04-21[/tpl]
Domain names are managed under a hierarchy headed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which manages the top of the DNS tree by administrating the data in the root nameservers.
IANA also operates the int registry for intergovernmental organizations, the arpa zone for protocol administration purposes, and other critical zones such as root-servers.net.
IANA delegates all other domain name authority to other domain name registries.
Country code top-level domains (ccTLD) are delegated by IANA to national registries such as DENIC in Germany and Nominet in the United Kingdom.

Sid Vicious, born John Simon Ritchie, later named John Beverley (10 May 1957 – 2 February 1979), was an English bass guitarist and vocalist most famous as a member of the influential punk group the Sex Pistols.
Vicious joined the Sex Pistols in early 1977 to replace Glen Matlock, who had fallen out of favour with the rest of the group. Due to intravenous drug use, Vicious was hospitalized with hepatitis during the recording of the Sex Pistols' debut album Never Mind the Bollocks. Accordingly, Vicious' bass is only partially featured on one song from the album. Vicious would later appear as a lead vocalist, performing three cover songs, on the soundtrack to The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, a largely fictionalized documentary about the Sex Pistols produced by the group's former manager Malcolm McLaren and director Julien Temple.
During the brief and chaotic ascendancy of the Sex Pistols, Vicious met eventual girlfriend and manager Nancy Spungen. Spungen and Vicious entered a destructive codependent relationship based on drug use. This culminated in Spungen's death from an apparent stab wound while staying in the Hotel Chelsea, Manhattan, with Vicious. Under suspicion of having committed Spungen's murder, Vicious was released on bail; he was later arrested again for assaulting Todd Smith, brother of Patti Smith, at a night club and underwent drug rehabilitation on Rikers Island. In celebration of Vicious' release from prison, his mother hosted at his girlfriend's Greenwich Village residence a party for him which was attended notably by the Misfits bassist Jerry Only.
Vicious' mother had been supplying Vicious with drugs and paraphernalia since he was young and assisted him in procuring heroin late that night. Vicious died in his sleep, having overdosed on the heroin his mother had procured.
After Vicious' death, the soundtrack album of The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle was released on the 26th of February 1979, a near 4 weeks after his death. Later that year on the 15th of December 1979, a compilation of live material recorded during his brief solo career was packaged and released as Sid Sings.

[[Himnusz]]

CATEGORIES: Hungarian culture, National anthems, National symbols of Hungary, Hungarian patriotic songs, 1823 compositions, 1823 songs

"Himnusz" (in English: Anthem, the word having the same origin as the English hymn from the Latin hymnus) is a musical poetic prayer beginning with the words Isten, áldd meg a magyart [tpl]audio|Hu-Isten áldd meg a magyart.ogg|listen[/tpl] (God, bless the Hungarians) that serves as the official national anthem of Hungary. It was adopted in 1844 and the first stanza is sung at official ceremonies. The words were written by Ferenc Kölcsey, a nationally renowned poet in 1823, and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel, although other less-known musical versions exist. The poem bore the subtitle "A magyar nép zivataros századaiból" ("From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian people"); it is often argued that this subtitle – by emphasizing past rather than contemporary national troubles – was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship. The full meaning of the poem's text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history.
The poem and song titled "Szózat" (in English Charge), which starts with the words Hazádnak rendületlenül légy híve, óh magyar (To your homeland be faithful steadfastly, O Hungarian) enjoys a social status nearly equal to that of "Himnusz", even though only "Himnusz" is mentioned in the Constitution of Hungary.  Traditionally, Himnusz is sung at the beginning of ceremonies, and Szózat at the end (although the Himnusz, resembling a Protestant Chorale, is substantially easier to sing than the difficult rhythm of the Szózat, which is often only played from recording).
Recognition is also given to the Rákóczi March, a short wordless piece (composer unknown, but sometimes attributed to János Bihari) which is often used on state military occasions; and the poem Nemzeti dal written by Sándor Petőfi.
The public radio station Kossuth Rádió plays Himnusz at ten minutes past midnight each day at the close of transmissions in the AM band, as do the state TV channels at the end of the day's broadcasts. Himnusz is also traditionally played on Hungarian television at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. Even in private homes, people will stand and sing along at that time.
Another popular song is the Székely Himnusz (Szekler Anthem), an unofficial national anthem of the Hungarian-speaking Szeklers living in Eastern Transylvania (now part of Romania) and in the rest of the world.
The words of the Hungarian anthem are unusual in expressing a direct plea to God rather than proclaiming national pride, the norm for the genre. This reference to God meant that during the period of strongest communist rule in Hungary (1949–1956), the anthem was played but the words were never sung. Party Secretary Mátyás Rákosi even asked poet Gyula Illyés and composer Zoltán Kodály, two of the nation's most acclaimed artists at the time, to write a new, communist-themed national anthem. Both, however, refused. Following the collapse of the attempted Revolution of 1956, the new communist leader János Kádár tried unsuccessfully to replace Himnusz with Szózat as the national anthem[tpl]cn|date=November 2012[/tpl].

The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), often referred to simply as the Missouri Synod, is a traditional, confessional Lutheran denomination in the United States. With 2.2 million members, it is both the eighth largest Protestant denomination and the second-largest Lutheran body in the U.S., the largest being Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The LCMS was organized in 1847 at a meeting in Chicago, Illinois as the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States, a name which reflected the geographic locations of the founding congregations. The LCMS is headquartered in Kirkwood, Missouri.
Approximately half of the LCMS members are located in the Upper Midwest, although it is represented in all 50 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.

[[Falisci]]

CATEGORIES: Falisci, Ancient Italic peoples

Falisci ([tpl]lang-grc|Φαλίσκοι[/tpl]) is the ancient Roman exonym for an Italic people who lived in what was then Etruria, on the Etruscan side of the Tiber River. The region is now entirely Lazio. They spoke an Italic language, Faliscan, closely akin to Latin. Originally a sovereign state, politically and socially they supported the Etruscans, joining the Etruscan League. This conviction and affiliation led to their ultimate near destruction and total subjugation by Rome.
Only one instance of their own endonym has been found to date: an inscription from Falerii Novi from the late 2nd century AD refers to the falesce quei in Sardinia sunt, "the Faliscans who are in Sardinia," where falesce is the nominative plural case. An Etruscan inscription calls them the feluskeś. The Latin cannot be far different from the original name. The -sc- suffix is "distinctive of the Italic ethnonyms."[tpl]harvnb|Bakkum|2009|pp=25–26[/tpl].

The municipality comprises the city of Aarschot proper and the towns of Gelrode, Langdorp and Rillaar. On January 1, 2006 Aarschot had a total population of 27,864. The total area is 62.52 km² which gives a population density of 446 inhabitants per km².
It is located in the part of Flemish Brabant called Hageland, located to the east of Leuven. Aarschot is a very typical town with a long history, dating back to the era of the Roman emperors, according to myths.  The church, which dominates the look of the city, is built with the typical brown stone harvested from the hills in the neighborhood.  The same hills that, in the Middle Ages, were home to some of the most well-regarded vineyards of Europe. Today the chain hills, which originate in Bolderberg, Heusden-Zolder, and continue as far as Calais in France, are mainly covered with woods and fruit yards.
While the Church of Our Lady (Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk) definitely leaves its mark on the appearance of the city, nothing defines Aarschot better than the river that passes through it: the Demer. Aarschot is situated in the valley of this brown-colored river.

[tpl]nihongo|Mewtwo|ミュウツー|Myūtsū|[/tpl] is a fictional creature from Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon media franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, it first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and their sequels, and later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles, as well as animation adaptations of the franchise. Masachika Ichimura voiced Mewtwo in Japanese, and the creature's younger self is voiced by Fujiko Takimoto in the Sound Picture Box: Mewtwo's Origin CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo in the anime adaptation. In English, Phillip Bartlett voices Mewtwo in Mewtwo Strikes Back, with Dan Green providing the voice in Mewtwo Returns.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.absoluteanime.com/pokemon/mewtwo.htm |title=Mewtwo Voice Actors |publisher=Absolute Anime |accessdate=2008-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Rauzi, Robin |date=2000-04-06 |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/cl-movie000406-143,0,6593417.story |title=Pokemon: The First Movie |work=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=2008-10-21[/tpl] Actress Reiko Takashima voices a separate Mewtwo character in the prequel special Mewtwo: Prologue to Awakening and the film ExtremeSpeed Genesect: Mewtwo Awakens.
In the video games, the player can fight and capture Mewtwo to pit it against other Pokémon. The player first learns of Mewtwo late in Pokémon Red and Blue by reading research documents left in a ruined laboratory on Cinnabar Island. The documents reveal that a solitary scientist spent years genetically engineering a descendant of the Pokémon Mew. Mewtwo eventually escaped after proving too strong to contain.
Regarded as one of the series' strongest Pokémon, it changed the way players approached the games by forcing them to find ways to counteract those using Mewtwo. Studies found the character popular with older male children, which contrasted with its counterpart Mew. Reactions to the character's anime portrayal have been divided, as reviewers such as Daily Record cited him as a cliché villain, while others such as Animerica and Sight & Sound praised the character's depth.

Tolkien's  Middle-earth writings. It became the heavily fortified capital of Gondor in the second half of the Third Age. It was originally built to guard the former capital, Osgiliath, from attack from the west, but became the capital when Osgiliath fell into ruin following the Kin-strife and the Great Plague. It is often referred to as the White City (though that name is not in the book) and the City of the Kings. The Rohirrim sometimes translated this into their own language as "the Mundburg". In the climax of The Lord of the Rings the city comes under a very large and determined attack by the allied forces of Mordor.

The Hernici were an Italic tribe of ancient Italy, whose territory was in Latium between the Lago di Fucino and the Sacco River (Trerus), bounded by the Volsci on the south, and by the Aequi and the Marsi on the north.
In 495 BC Livy records that they entered into a treaty with the Volsci against ancient Rome. Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.22
They long maintained their independence, and in 486 BC were still strong enough to conclude an equal treaty with the Latins.Dionysius of Halicarnassus viii. 64 and 68 They broke away from Rome in 362Livy vii. 6 if. and in 306,Livy ix. 42 when their chief town Anagnia was taken and reduced to a praefectura, but Ferentinum, Aletrium and Verulae were rewarded for their fidelity by being allowed to remain free municipia, a position which at that date they preferred to the civitas.
The name of the Hernici, like that of the Volsci, is missing from the list of Italian peoples whom Polybiusii. 24 describes as able to furnish troops in 225 BC; by that date, therefore, their territory cannot have been distinguished from Latium generally, and it seems probable that they had then received the full Roman citizenship. The oldest Latin inscriptions of the district (from FerentinumC.I.L. x. 5837-5840) are earlier than the Social War, and present no local characteristic.

[[Aequi]]

The Aequi ([tpl]lang-grc|Αἴκουοι and Αἴκοι[/tpl]) were an Italic tribe of northeast Latium and the central Apennines of Italy who appear in the early history of ancient Rome. After a long struggle for independence from Rome they were defeated and substantial Roman colonies were placed on their soil. Only two inscriptions believed to be in the Aequian language remain. No more can be deduced than that the language was Italic. Otherwise the inscriptions from the region are those of the Latin-speaking colonists in Latin. The colonial exonym documented in these inscriptions is Aequi and also Aequicoli ("colonists of Aequium"). The manuscript variants of the classical authors present Equic-, Aequic-, Aequac-.[tpl]cite book |first=Robert Seymour |last=Conway |title=The Italic Dialects | year=1897 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=301–305[/tpl] If the form without the -coli is taken as an original, it may well also be the endonym, but to date further evidence is lacking.

Iannis Xenakis (Greek: Γιάννης (Ιάννης) Ξενάκης [tpl]IPA-el|ˈʝanis kseˈnakis|[/tpl]; 29 May 1922 – 4 February 2001) was a Greek-French composer, music theorist, and architect-engineer. After 1947, he fled Greece, becoming a naturalized citizen of France. He is commonly recognized as one of the most important post-war avant-garde composers.Hoffmann, Grove: "Xenakis belongs to the pioneering generation of composers who revolutionized 20th-century music after World War II."MSN Encarta encyclopedia, "Iannis Xenakis (Ιάννης Ξενάκης) (May 29, 1922[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]February 4, 2001) was a Greek composer and one of the most important modernist composers of the 20th century" http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567526/yannis_xenakis.html. Archived 31 October 2009. Xenakis pioneered the use of mathematical models in music such as applications of set theory, stochastic processes and game theory and was also an important influence on the development of electronic and computer music. He integrated music with architecture, designing music for pre-existing spaces, and designing spaces to be integrated with specific music compositions and performances.
Among his most important works are Metastaseis (1953–54) for orchestra, which introduced independent parts for every musician of the orchestra; percussion works such as Psappha (1975) and Pléïades (1979); compositions that introduced spatialization by dispersing musicians among the audience, such as Terretektorh (1966); electronic works created using Xenakis's UPIC system; and the massive multimedia performances Xenakis called polytopes. Among the numerous theoretical writings he authored, the book Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition (French edition 1963, English translation 1971) is regarded as one of his most important. As an architect, Xenakis is primarily known for his early work under Le Corbusier: the Sainte Marie de La Tourette, on which the two architects collaborated, and the Philips Pavilion at Expo 58, which Xenakis designed by himself.

Throughout its history, Kings Island has appeared in popular sitcoms and has been highly publicized for its record-breaking attractions and events. One of the park's most well-known attractions, The Racer, is often credited with reviving worldwide interest in the roller coaster industry during the 1970s. Other attractions such as The Beast and Banshee set new world records including some that are still held. The park has also suffered through times of negative publicity particularly regarding the early demise of roller coasters The Bat and Son of Beast.
Kings Island is divided into several themed sections. The seasonal amusement park is open from April through Labor Day and reopens for a short time on weekends beginning in September for Halloween-themed events. As of 2012, Kings Island is the second-most visited seasonal amusement park in the United States behind Cedar Point with an estimated 3.21 million visitors.

Genetic manipulators who traffic in biological products such as artificial eyes, gholas, and "twisted" Mentats, the Tleilaxu are a major power in the Imperium. The race is ruled by a small council of Tleilaxu Masters, whose genetically-engineered Face Dancer servants have the ability to mimic any human. The Masters themselves possess a bland and diminutive appearance intended to compel other races to underestimate them. In Heretics of Dune (1984) it is revealed that they are a secret totalitarian theocracy ultimately seeking domination of the known universe. Despite their influence, the Bene Tleilax are universally distrusted and inspire disgust because their products, though desirable, push the limits of the moral proscriptions established by the ancient Butlerian Jihad.

Shaddam Corrino IV is a fictional character in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. He is Padishah Emperor of the known universe in Herbert's 1965 novel Dune. Shaddam's accession to the throne is chronicled in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999-2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.
Born in year 10,134 A.G.

His reign is noted chiefly for the Arrakis Revolt, blamed by many historians on Shaddam IV's dalliance with Court functions and the pomp of office. The ranks of Bursegs were doubled in the first sixteen years of his reign. Appropriations for Sardaukar training went down steadily in the final thirty years before the Arrakis Revolt. He had five daughters (Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia, Josifa, and Rugi) and no legal sons. Four of the daughters accompanied him into retirement.

Shaddam is described as "red-haired" by his daughter Irulan via epigraph in Dune, and noted to be 72 years old yet looking no older than 35. He is portrayed by José Ferrer in the 1984 David Lynch film adaptation Dune, and by Giancarlo Giannini in the 2000 Dune miniseries.

[[Young British Artists]]

CATEGORIES: British artist groups and collectives, British contemporary artists, Young British Artists

The Young British Artists, or YBAsSometimes with lower case, as "young British artist(s)" or "yBa". — also referred to as Brit artists and Britart — is the name given to a loose group of visual artists who first began to exhibit together in London, in 1988. Many of the artists graduated from the BA Fine Art course at Goldsmiths, in the late 1980s.
The scene began around a series of artist-led exhibitions held in warehouses and factories, beginning in 1988 with the Damien Hirst-led Freeze and, in 1990, East Country Yard Show and Modern Medicine.
They are noted for "shock tactics", use of throwaway materials, wild-living, and an attitude "both oppositional and entrepreneurial."Bush, Kate. "Young British art: the YBA sensation", Artforum, June 2004, p. 91. Retrieved from findarticles.com, 14 March 2010. They achieved considerable media coverage and dominated British art during the 1990s—international survey shows in the mid-1990s included Brilliant! and Sensation.
Many of the artists were initially supported and collected by Charles Saatchi. Leading artists of the group include Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. Key works include Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, a shark preserved in formaldehyde in a vitrine, and Emin's My Bed, a dishevelled double bed surrounded by detritus.
The first use of the term "young British artists" was by Michael Corris in ArtForum, May 1992.Corris, Michael. "British? Young? Invisible? w/Attitude?.", "ArtForum", May 1992, p. 109. Retrieved from http://www.blumandpoe.com/sites/default/files/press/GallaccioArtforum0592.pdf, 20 April 2011. The acronym term "YBA" (or "yBa") was not coined until 1996 (in Art Monthly magazine). It has become a historic term, as most of the YBAs were born in the mid-1960s.

Maurus Servius Honoratus was a late fourth-century and early fifth-century grammarian, with the contemporary reputation of being the most learned man of his generation in Italy; he was the author of a set of commentaries on the works of Virgil.  These works, In tria Virgilii Opera Expositio, constituted the first incunable to be printed at Florence, by Bernardo Cennini, 1471.
In the Saturnalia of Macrobius, Servius appears as one of the interlocutors; allusions in that work and a letter from Symmachus to Servius indicate that he was not a convert to Christianity.

Sepsis is usually treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. If fluid replacement is not sufficient to maintain blood pressure, vasopressors can be used. Mechanical ventilation and dialysis may be needed to support the function of the lungs and kidneys, respectively. To guide therapy, a central venous catheter and an arterial catheter may be placed; measurement of other hemodynamic variables (such as cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation or stroke volume variation) may also be used. Sepsis patients require preventive measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers and pressure ulcers, unless other conditions prevent this.

Iron deficiency (sideropenia or hypoferremia) is one of the most common of the nutritional deficiencies.[ref]
 electronic-book ISBN 978-94-007-5561-1 [tpl]issn|1559-0836[/tpl] electronic-[tpl]issn|1868-0402[/tpl][/ref]   Iron is present in all cells in the human body, and has several vital functions. Examples include as a carrier of oxygen to the tissues from the lungs in the form of hemoglobin, as a transport medium for electrons within the cells in the form of cytochromes, and as an integral part of enzyme reactions in various tissues. Too little iron can interfere with these vital functions and lead to morbidity and death.
The eventual consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia where the body's stores of iron have been depleted and the body is unable to maintain levels of haemoglobin in the blood. Children and pre-menopausal women are the groups most prone to the disease.
Total body iron averages approximately 3.8 g in men and 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron is carried tightly bound to the protein transferrin. There are several mechanisms that control human iron metabolism and safeguard against iron deficiency. The main regulatory mechanism is situated in the gastrointestinal tract. When loss of iron is not sufficiently compensated by adequate intake of iron from the diet, a state of iron deficiency develops over time. When this state is uncorrected, it leads to iron deficiency anemia.

Oleg of Novgorod (Slavic: Олег, Old Norse: Helgi) was a Varangian prince (or konung) who ruled all or part of the Rus' people during the early 10th century.
He is credited with moving the capital of Rus' from Novgorod the Great to Kiev and, in doing so, he laid the foundation of the powerful state of Kievan Rus'. He also launched at least one attack on Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. According to East Slavic chronicles, Oleg was supreme ruler of the Rus' from 882 to 912. 
This traditional dating has been challenged by some historians, who point out that it is inconsistent with such other sources as the Schechter Letter, which mentions the activities of certain khagan HLGW of Rus' as late the 940s, during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Romanus I. The nature of Oleg's relationship with the Rurikid ruling family of the Rus', and specifically with his successor Igor of Kiev, is a matter of much controversy among historians.

[[Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart]]
CATEGORIES: Camper Van Beethoven albums, 1988 albums, Virgin Records albums, Albums produced by Dennis Herring

Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart is a 1988 album by Camper Van Beethoven, released on Virgin Records.  It was the band's first major-label album, and was produced by Dennis Herring, the first time the band had used an outside producer. 
The lineup on the album included David Lowery on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Jonathan Segel on violin, mandolin, keyboards, guitar and backing vocals, Victor Krummenacher on bass and backing vocals, Greg Lisher on lead guitar, and Chris Pedersen on drums.  It was the first Camper Van Beethoven album not to feature founding guitarist/drummer/multi-instrumentalist Chris Molla. 
The album featured the band's trademark eclectic mix of musics, including folk, ska, Eastern European music, Americana, psychedelic rock, and Middle-Eastern music.  Despite this, it has a considerably smoother and more mainstream sound than the band's previous, more garage-rock oriented albums, largely due to Herring's production. The reunited Camper Van Beethoven features a number of tracks from the album in its setlists, including most of the first side, as well as Waka, Tania, and Life is Grand from the second side.

Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay, PC (25 October 1800 – 28 December 1859) was a British historian and Whig politician. He wrote extensively as an essayist and reviewer; his books on British history were hailed as literary masterpieces.John MacKenzie, "A family empire," BBC History Magazine (Jan 2013)
Macaulay held political office as the Secretary at War between 1839 and 1841 and the Paymaster-General between 1846 and 1848. He played a major role in introducing English and western concepts to education in India. He supported the replacement of Persian by English as the official language, the use of English as the medium of instruction in all schools, and the training of English-speaking Indians as teachers.John MacKenzie, "A family empire," BBC History Magazine (Jan 2013)
In his view, Macaulay divided the world into civilised nations and barbarism, with Britain representing the high point of civilisation. In his Minute on Indian Education of February 1835, he observes, "It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgement used at preparatory schools in England".He was wedded to the Idea of Progress, especially in terms of the liberal freedoms.  He opposed radicalism while idealising historic British culture and traditions.John MacKenzie, "A family empire," BBC History Magazine (Jan 2013)

EUREKA aims to coordinate efforts of governments, research institutes and commercial companies concerning innovation. It does not partake in military research and follows a "bottom-up" approach to R&D funding, industry itself deciding which projects should be developed.
As of July 2013, EUREKA has 41 full members, including the European Union (represented by the European Commission). All 28 EU Member States are also members of EUREKA.
EUREKA is not an EU research program, but rather an intergovernmental organization, of which the EU is a member. Cooperation and synergy are sought between EUREKA and the research activities of the EU proper, notably with European Union's Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development and the European Research Area.

The Bromley Contingent is a label invented by journalist Caroline CoonMark Paytress, the biography of Siouxsie, sanctuary publishing, 2003 about a group of followers and fans of the Sex Pistols. They owed their name to Bromley, an area of south-east London, where some of them lived. They helped popularise the fashion of the early UK punk movement. Most of them were fans of David Bowie. 
The group included Siouxsie Sioux, Jordan, Soo Catwoman,Picture of the Bromley contingent with catwoman posing photograph : Ray Stevenson.

Retrieved 30 November 2011 and Sharon Hayman. 
The Bromley Contingent attained a degree of notoriety in December 1976 when Siouxsie, Severin, Thomas and Barker appeared on ITV with the Sex Pistols on Thames Television's early evening television programme Today."Never mind four-letter words... here's the Sex Pistols: when television met punk rock". The Independent. Retrieved 15 June 2012 Interviewed by television journalist Bill Grundy, Sex Pistols singer Johnny Rotten used the word "shit". Siouxsie then teased the presenter by telling him "I've always wanted to meet you", to which he replied; "Did you really? We'll meet afterwards, shall we?". This comment provoked guitarist Steve Jones to call Grundy a "dirty sod", a "dirty old man", a "dirty bastard", a "dirty fucker" and a "fucking rotter"."Today show" ITV. December 1976Sex Pistols on Bill Grundy's 'Today' show most requested clip. NME. Retrieved 15 June 2012 That was the first time in the history of UK television that viewers had heard swearing at this hour of the day. Although the programme was only seen in the Thames Television region, the ensuing furore occupied the tabloid newspapers for days and shortly after the Sex Pistols were dropped by their record label, EMI. This episode changed the face of music in Britain. Up until December 1976, punk rock was a relative low-key fashion, apart from appearing from time to time in small parts in music papers. 
In the following week, Siouxsie appeared on the front page of the Daily Mirror with the legend "Siouxsie's a punk shocker".Daily Mirror front cover December 1976 In February 1977, she stopped attending Pistols concerts and started to tour with her friend Severin under the name of Siouxsie and the Banshees.
The notoriety of the Bromley Contingent in the press continued in June 1977, when Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren rented a boat for the band and fans to sail down the River Thames during Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee anniversary celebration. When the police forced the boat to dock, several Pistols fans were arrested and injured in the melee. Bromley Contingent members Debbie Juvenile and Tracie O'Keefe (both employees of McLaren in his Kings Road clothing boutique Seditionaries) were charged with obstruction and assaulting a police officer.Punk 77: Tracie O'Keefe While Juvenile was acquitted of the charges, O'Keefe was sentenced to one month's imprisonment, although later acquitted on appeal. O'Keefe died unexpectedly in early 1978 of bone marrow cancer at the age of 18.  
Many of the Bromley Contingent went on to form bands themselves including The Banshees and Generation X. Arguably they had greater influence than Malcolm McLaren's shops and Vivienne Westwood's designs in shaping the development and look of the early UK punk movement. The fashion statements made by Siouxsie, in particular, incorporating fetish and bondage clothing, and her innovative style of makeup, continue to live on.
Simon Barker became a photographer, using the nickname 'Six'.3:AM Magazine, August 2002 Bertie 'Berlin' Marshall became a writer, publishing a novel, Psychoboys in 1999 and a memoir Berlin Bromley in 2001 which received favourable reviews from The GuardianSAF Publishing and Time Out London magazine.Time Out London Philip Salon became a fixture of the British New Romantic club scene in the early 1980s alongside the likes of Steve Strange and Boy George.The Blitz Kids 
Sid Vicious, the bassist who replaced Glen Matlock in the Sex Pistols, claimed he despised the Bromley Contingent, despite having played drums for the Banshees' debut live appearance at the 100 Club Punk Festival in 1976. In a 1977 interview for BBC Wales, Vicious claimed to have invented the Pogo as a means to knock them over at the 100 Club.

Godspeed You! Black Emperor (formerly punctuated Godspeed You Black Emperor! and commonly referred to as just "Godspeed", or abbreviated to GYBE or GY!BE) is a Canadian post-rock band which originated in Montreal, Quebec in 1994. They release their recordings through Constellation, an independent record label also located in Montreal.
After the release of their debut album in 1997, the group toured regularly from 1998 to 2002. In 2003, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in order for band members to pursue other musical interests. In the intervening period, the group was occasionally rumored to have broken up,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/godspeed-you-black-emperor/34219|title=Godspeed You!

[[Pedestrian crossing]]
CATEGORIES: Pedestrian crossings, Pedestrian infrastructure, Road infrastructure, Road safety, Traffic law, Walking

A pedestrian crossing or crosswalk is a designated point on a road at which some means are employed to assist pedestrians wishing to cross. They are designed to keep pedestrians together where they can be seen by motorists, and where they can cross most safely across the flow of vehicular traffic.
Marked pedestrian crossings are often found at intersections, but may also be at other points on busy roads that would otherwise be too unsafe to cross without assistance due to vehicle numbers, speed or road widths. They are also commonly installed where large numbers of pedestrians are attempting to cross (such as in shopping areas) or where vulnerable road users (such as school children) regularly cross. Rules govern usage of the pedestrian crossings to ensure safety; for example, in some areas, the pedestrian must be more than halfway across the crosswalk before the driver proceeds.
Signalised pedestrian crossings clearly separate when each type of traffic (pedestrians or road vehicles) can use the crossing. Unsignalized crossings generally assist pedestrians, and usually prioritise pedestrians, depending on the locality. What appear to be just pedestrian crossings can also be created largely as a traffic calming technique, especially when combined with other features like pedestrian priority, refuge islands, or raised surfaces.

[[Reverse discrimination]]

CATEGORIES: Definition of racism controversy, Discrimination, Affirmative action

Reverse discrimination is discrimination against members of a dominant or majority group or in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Groups may be defined in terms of race, gender, ethnicity, or other factors. This discrimination may seek to redress social inequalities where minority groups have been denied access to the same privileges of the majority group. In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face. The label reverse discrimination may also be used to highlight the discrimination inherent in affirmative action programs. Reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies, as in college admissions or employment, intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities.http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1696883576127835788&q=Abigail+Fisher&hl=en&as_sdt=2,7[tpl]cite web|title=Reverse Discrimination|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reverse+discrimination[/tpl] Conceptualizing efforts as reverse discrimination began to become popular in the early-mid-1970s, the time period that focused on underrepresentation and affirmative action intended to remedy the effects of past discrimination.
The concept of reverse discrimination has two different views: a broad sense and a narrow sense. In a broad sense, it refers to discrimination against Whites or males in employment, education, and any other areas of life. In a narrow sense, reverse discrimination refers to the negative impact Whites or males may experience because of affirmative action policies. The two views are often conflated, which leads to confusion and misinformation.[tpl]cite book|last=Pincus|first=F|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|location=Thousands Oaks, CA|isbn=9781412963879|pages=1160–1162|editor=R. Schaefer|title=Encyclopedia of race, ethnicity, and society[/tpl]
The law in some countries, such as the UK, draws a distinction between “equality of provision” and “equality of outcome”, based on the idea that identical treatment may sometimes act to preserve inequality rather than eliminate it. Opponents of this distinction may label it as an example of reverse discrimination.

Route 64 is a [tpl]convert|0.32|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a state-maintained bridge over Amtrak and New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor line in West Windsor. Route 64 begins at an intersection with County Route 526 and County Route 571 in West Windsor. It heads along the bridge to an intersection with County Route 615, where Route 64 ends. County routes 526 and 571, which are unofficially concurrent with Route 64, continues to Hightstown.
Route 64 was designated originally as an alignment of Route 31A, a spur off of State Highway Route 31 (currently U.S. Route 206) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route 33. The state planned on turning the alignment into a full-fledged expressway for several decades, including constructing the alignment that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route 31A to Route 64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed to become part of the Princeton–Hightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route 92), but completion never occurred. Currently, the route remains the bridge over the Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route 64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route 1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571.

It is a place where "hens lay soft boiled eggs" and there are "cigarette trees."  McClintock claimed to have written the song in 1895, based on tales from his youth hoboing through the United States, but some believe that at least aspects of the song have existed for far longer.

Born Hyder Naik, he distinguished himself militarily, eventually drawing the attention of Mysore's rulers. Rising to the post of Dalavayi (commander-in-chief) to Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, he came to dominate the titular monarch and the Mysore government. He became the de facto ruler of Mysore as Sarvadhikari (Chief Minister) by 1761.KHUDADAD The Family of Tipu Sultan GENEALOGY He offered strong anti-colonial resistance against the military advances of the British East India Company during the First and Second Anglo–Mysore Wars, and he was the innovator of military use of the iron-cased Mysorean rockets.
Though illiterate, Hyder Ali earned an important place in the history of southern India for his administrative acumen and military skills. He concluded an alliance with the French against the British, and used the services of French workmen in raising his artillery and arsenal. His rule of Mysore was characterised by frequent warfare with his neighbours and rebellion within his territories. This was not unusual for the time, as much of the Indian subcontinent was then in turmoil. He spoke Kannada, Telugu, Hindustani, Persian, Marathi and Tamil fluently.

During this period, the major and minor nobility left their country residences and lived in Georgian mansions in places like Rutland Square (now Parnell Square), Mountjoy Square, Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin. Those with less financial means lived in (or in some cases rented) smaller properties in streets nearby.
The focal point of the Social Season was the move of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (the King's representative) from his 'out of season' residence, the Viceregal Lodge (now Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence of the President of Ireland) to live in state in the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle, where he and his wife hosted a series of levées, drawing rooms, banquets and balls in the Castle. 
The period of the social season also coincided with the parliamentary sessions of the Irish House of Lords, which many of the peers in Dublin would be attending. However the Irish Parliament was abolished with the Act of Union which merged the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. 
With the abolition of the lord lieutenancy in 1922, the emergence of a new nationalist state (the Irish Free State) the same year, and the economic and social downturn that resulted from World War I, the Social Season dwindled and then died. Most of the aristrocratic homes in Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square were sold and are now used as corporate offices. 
Among the Irish peers who would reside in Dublin during the 'Social Season' were

Cepheid variables are divided into several subclasses which exhibit markedly different masses, ages, and evolutionary histories: Classical Cepheids, Type II Cepheids, Anomalous Cepheids, and Dwarf Cepheids.  
The term cepheid originates from Delta Cephei in the constellation Cepheus, the first star of this type identified, by John Goodricke in 1784.  Delta Cephei is also of particular importance as a calibrator of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation since its distance is among the most precisely established for a Cepheid, thanks in part to its membership in a star clustername=dezeeuw1999>de Zeeuw, P.

[[Book of the Dead]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Egyptian funerary texts, Egyptian mythology, Ancient Egyptian texts, Book of the Dead, 2nd millennium BCE in religion, Archaeological corpora documents, Works of unknown authorship

The Book of the Dead is an ancient Egyptian funerary text, used from the beginning of the New Kingdom (around 1550 BCE) to around 50 BCE.Taylor 2010, p.54 The original Egyptian name for the text, transliterated rw nw prt m hrwAllen, 2000. p.316 is translated as "Book of Coming Forth by Day".Taylor 2010, p.55; or perhaps "Utterances of Going Forth by Day" - D'Auria 1988, p.187 Another translation would be "Book of emerging forth into the Light". The text consists of a number of magic spells intended to assist a dead person's journey through the Duat, or underworld, and into the afterlife. 
The Book of the Dead was part of a tradition of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, which were painted onto objects, not papyrus. Some of the spells included were drawn from these older works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other spells were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the spells which made up the Book continued to be inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, as had always been the spells from which they originated. The Book of the Dead was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased.
There was no single or  canonical Book of the Dead. The surviving papyri contain a varying selection of religious and magical texts and vary considerably in their illustration. Some people seem to have commissioned their own copies of the Book of the Dead, perhaps choosing the spells they thought most vital in their own progression to the afterlife. The Book of the Dead was most commonly written in hieroglyphic or hieratic script on a papyrus scroll, and often illustrated with vignettes depicting the deceased and their journey into the afterlife.

The Amduat[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] (literally "That Which Is In the Afterworld", also translated as "Text of the Hidden Chamber Which is in the Underworld" and "Book of What is in the Underworld")Forman and Quirke (1996), p. 117. is an important Ancient Egyptian funerary text of the New Kingdom. Like many funerary texts, it was found written on the inside of the pharaoh's tomb for reference. Unlike other funerary texts, however, it was reserved only for pharaohs (until the 21st Dynasty almost exclusively) or very favored nobility.Hornung (1999), p.27
It tells the story of Ra, the Egyptian sun god who travels through the underworld, from the time when the sun sets in the west and rises again in the east. It is said that the dead Pharaoh is taking this same journey, ultimately to become one with Ra and live forever.
The underworld is divided into twelve hours of the night, each representing different allies and enemies for the Pharaoh/sun god to encounter. The Amduat names all of these gods and monsters. The main purpose of the Amduat is to give the names of these gods and monsters to the spirit of the dead Pharaoh, so he can call upon them for help or use their name to defeat them.
As well as enumerating and naming the inhabitants of the Duat (or Dwat) both good and bad, the illustrations of the 'book' show clearly the topography of the underworld. The earliest complete version of the Amduat is found in KV34, the tomb of Thutmose III in the Valley of the Kings.

The Fremen [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɛ|m|ən[/tpl] are a group of people in the fictional Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. First appearing in the 1965 novel Dune, the Fremen inhabit the desert planet Arrakis (also known as Dune), which is the sole known source of the all-important spice melange in the universe. Long overlooked by the rest of the Imperium and considered backward savages, in reality they are an extremely hardy people and exist in large numbers. The Fremen had come to the planet thousands of years before the events of the novel as the Zensunni Wanderers, a religious sect in retreat. As humans in extremis, over time they adapt their culture and way of life to survive and thrive in the incredibly harsh conditions of Arrakis. The Fremen are distinguished by their fierce fighting abilities and adeptness at survival in these conditions. With water such a rare commodity on the planet, their culture revolves around its preservation and conservation.[tpl]cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Herbert |title=Dune |url= |year=1965 |publisher= |isbn= |pages=[/tpl] Herbert based their culture, in part, on the desert-dwelling Bedouin and Kalahari Bushmen.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sinanvural.com/seksek/inien/tvd/tvd2.htm |title=Interview with Frank Herbert and Beverly Herbert| last=McNelly |first=Willis E.|authorlink=Willis E.

[[Cyclic nucleotide]]
CATEGORIES: Nucleotides

A cyclic nucleotide (cNMP) is a single phosphateor nucleotide with a cyclic bond arrangement between the sugar and phosphate groups.  Like other nucleotides, cyclic nucleotides are composed of three functional groups: a sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a single phosphate group.  As can be seen in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) images, the 'cyclic' portion consists of two bonds between the phosphate group and the 3' and 5' hydroxyl groups of the sugar, very often a ribose.
Their biological significance includes a broad range of protein-ligand interactions.  They have been identified as secondary messengers in both hormone and ion-channel signalling in eukaryotic cells, as well as allosteric effector compounds of DNA binding proteins in prokaryotic cells.  cAMP and cGMP are currently the most well documented cyclic nucleotides, however there is evidence that cCMP (cytosine) is also involved in eukaryotic cellular messaging.  The role of cyclic uridine monophosphate (cUMP) is even less well known.
Discovery of cyclic nucleotides has contributed greatly to the understanding of kinase and phosphatase mechanisms, as well as protein regulation in general.  Although more than 50 years have passed since their initial discovery, interest in cyclic nucleotides and their biochemical and physiological significance continues.

Media of the United States consist of several different types of communications media: television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, and Internet-based Web sites. The U.S. also has a strong music industry.
Many of the media are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenue from advertising, subscriptions, and sale of copyrighted material.
American media conglomerates tend to be leading global players, generating large revenues as well as large opposition in many parts of the world. With the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, further deregulation and convergence are under way, leading to mega-mergers, further concentration of media ownership, and the emergence of multinational media conglomerates. These mergers enable tighter control of information.Zinn, Howard. A People's History of the United States.

The duo was motivated to murder Franks by their desire to commit a perfect crime.
Once apprehended, Leopold and Loeb retained Clarence Darrow as counsel for the defense. Darrow’s summation in their trial is noted for its influential criticism of capital punishment as retributive, rather than a rehabilitative penal system. Leopold and Loeb were sentenced to life imprisonment. Loeb was killed by a fellow prisoner in 1936; Leopold was released on parole in 1958.
Leopold and Loeb have been the inspiration for several works in film, theatre, and fiction, such as the 1929 play Rope by Patrick Hamilton, and Alfred Hitchcock's take on the play in the 1948 film of the same name. Later movies such as Compulsion and Swoon were more accurate portrayals of the Leopold and Loeb case.

CATEGORIES: Communities, Rural geography, Types of communities

Sociologists[tpl]who|date=April 2013[/tpl] have identified a number of different types of rural communities, which have arisen as a result of changing economic trends within rural regions of industrial nations.
The basic trend seems to be one in which communities are required to become entrepreneurial. Those that lack the sort of characteristics mentioned below, are forced to either seek out their niche or accept eventual economic defeat. These towns focus on marketing and public relations whilst bidding for business and government operations, such as factories or off-site data processing.
For instance, International Falls, Minnesota markets itself as a site for sub-zero temperature experiments, Ottawa, Illinois has attracted three Japanese firms, Freeport, Maine has become a center for mail-order companies such as L. L. Bean, and Mobile, Arizona has become the home of a number of solid-waste landfills.

Drying is a method of food preservation that works by removing water from the food, which inhibits the growth of bacteria and has been practiced worldwide since ancient times to preserve food. Where or when dehydration as a food preservation technique was invented has been lost to time, however the earliest known practice of food drying is 12,000 B.C. by inhabitants of the modern Middle East and Asia regions. "Historical Origins of Food Preservation". Accessed June 2011. A solar or electric food dehydrator can greatly speed the drying process and ensure more consistent results. Water is usually removed by evaporation (air drying, sun drying, smoking or wind drying) but, in the case of freeze-drying, food is first frozen and pressure is reduce to a level that sublimation will take place then the water is removed. Bacteria, yeasts and molds need the water in the food to grow, and drying effectively prevents them from surviving in the food.

The anime has been given mostly positive reviews by critics in North America, which compliment its writing, characters, and amount of action.

Shrove Tuesday, a moveable feast, is determined by Easter.

The Jesus Seminar was a group of about 150 critical scholars and laymen founded in 1985 by Robert Funk under the auspices of the Westar Institute.Westar Institute accessed November 6, 2006Making Sense of the New Testament by Craig Blomberg (Mar 1, 2004) ISBN 0801027470 page 19 The seminar was active in the 1980s and 1990s. It preceded the short-lived Jesus Project, which was active 2008 to 2009. 
In March 2006, the Jesus Seminar began work on a new description of the emergence of the Jesus traditions through the first two centuries of the common era C.E.. In this new phase, the Jesus Seminar on Christian Origins, fellows employ the methods and techniques pioneered by the original Jesus Seminar.[tpl]cite web|title=Seminars|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/Seminars/seminars.html|publisher=Westar Institute|accessdate=17 January 2013[/tpl]   
The seminar uses votes with colored beads to decide their collective view of the historicity of the deeds and sayings of Jesus of Nazareth.The Jesus Seminar: Select Your Own Jesus http://biblequery.org/OtherBeliefs/LiberalChurches/JesusSeminar.htm;21st Century Alchemy?, by Dr. Paige Patterson http://www.beliefnet.com/story/29/story_2942_1.html They produced new translations of the New Testament and apocrypha to use as textual sources. They published their results in three reports: The Five Gospels (1993),The Five Gospels: The Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus (1993) Polebridge Press (Macmillan), ISBN 0-02-541949-8 The Acts of Jesus (1998),The Acts of Jesus: The Search for the Authentic Deeds of Jesus (1998), Harper SanFrancisco, ISBN 0-06-062979-7 and The Gospel of Jesus (1999).The Gospel of Jesus: According to the Jesus Seminar (1999), Polebridge Press (Macmillan), ISBN 0-944344-74-7 They also run a series of lectures and workshops in various U.S. cities.
The seminar's reconstruction of the historical Jesus portrayed him as an itinerant Hellenistic Jewish sage and faith healer who preached a gospel of liberation from injustice in startling parables and aphorisms. An iconoclast, Jesus broke with established Jewish theological dogmas and social conventions both in his teachings and behaviors, often by turning common-sense ideas upside down, confounding the expectations of his audience: He preached of "Heaven's imperial rule" (traditionally translated as "Kingdom of God") as being already present but unseen; he depicts God as a loving father; he fraternizes with outsiders and criticizes insiders. According to the seminar, Jesus was a mortal man born of two human parents, who did not perform nature miracles nor die as a substitute for sinners nor rise bodily from the dead. Sightings of a risen Jesus were nothing more than the visionary experiences of some of his disciples rather than physical encounters.
The seminar treats the canonical gospels as historical sources that represent Jesus' actual words and deeds as well as elaborations of the early Christian community and of the gospel authors. The fellows placed the burden of proof on those who advocate any passage's historicity. Unconcerned with canonical boundaries, they asserted that the Gospel of Thomas may have more authentic material than the Gospel of John.N.T. Wright, Five Gospels but no Gospel, 1999, p.5 PDF
The seminar holds a number of premises or "scholarly wisdom" about Jesus when critically approaching the gospels. They act on the premise that Jesus did not hold an apocalyptic worldview, an opinion that is controversial in mainstream scholarly studies of Jesus.http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/jesus/epsanders.html Rather than revealing an apocalyptic eschatology, which instructs his disciples to prepare for the end of the world, the fellows argue that the authentic words of Jesus indicate that he preached a sapiential eschatology, which encourages all of God's children to repair the world.[tpl]cite book| author = Crossan, John Dominic| title = The Essential Jesus: Original Sayings and Earliest Images, p. 8| publisher = Book Sales| year = 1998| isbn = 0-7858-0901-5[/tpl]Fredriksen, Paula. Excerpt from "From Jesus to Christ". In particular, note the second footnote for a brief overview of scholars supporting an apocalyptic view, including Bart D. Ehrman and John P. Meier.
The method and conclusions of the Jesus Seminar have come under harsh criticism by biblical scholars, historians and clergy for a variety of reasons.  It is the assertion of such critics that the Fellows of the seminar are not all trained scholars, that their voting technique doesn't allow for nuance, that they are preoccupied with Q and the Gospel of Thomas but omit material in other sources such as the Gospel of the Hebrews, and that they rely excessively on the criterion of embarrassment.Catherine M.

[[Usability engineering]]

CATEGORIES: Usability

Usability engineering is a field that is concerned generally with human-computer interaction and specifically with making human-computer interfaces that have high usability or user friendliness. In effect, a user-friendly interface is one that allows users to effectively and efficiently accomplish the tasks for which it was designed and one that users rate positively on opinion or emotional scales. Assessing the usability of an interface and recommending ways to improve it is the purview of the Usability Engineer. The largest subsets of Usability Engineers work to improve usability of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), web-based user interfaces, and voice user interfaces (VUIs).
Several broad disciplines including Psychology, Human Factors and Cognitive Science subsume usability engineering, but the theoretical foundations of the field come from more specific domains: human perception and action; human cognition; behavioral research methodologies; and, to a lesser extent, quantitative and statistical analysis techniques.
When usability engineering began to emerge as a distinct area of professional practice in the mid- to late 1980s, many usability engineers had a background in Computer Science or in a sub-field of Psychology such as Perception, Cognition or Human Factors. Today, these academic areas still serve as springboards for the professional practitioner of usability engineering, but Cognitive Science departments and academic programs in Human-Computer Interaction now also produce their share of practitioners in the field.
The term usability engineering (in contrast to interaction design and user experience design) implies more of a focus on assessing and making recommendations to improve usability than it does on design, though Usability Engineers may still engage in design to some extent, particularly design of wire-frames or other prototypes.

André Masséna (born Andrea Massena) 1st Duc de Rivoli, 1st Prince d'Essling (May 6, 1758 – April 4, 1817) was a French military commander during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.Donald D. Horward, ed., trans, annotated, The French Campaign in Portugal, An Account by Jean Jacques Pelet, 1810-1811 (Minneapolis, MN, 1973), 501.
Masséna was one of the original eighteen Marshals of the Empire created by Napoleon. His nickname was l'Enfant chéri de la Victoire ("the Dear Child of Victory").General Michel Franceschi (Ret.), Austerlitz (Montreal: International Napoleonic Society, 2005), 20.
Many of Napoleon's generals were trained at the finest French and European military academies, but Masséna was among those who achieved greatness without benefit of formal education. This, however, does not imply that he was poorly educated in the art of war or lacked administrative abilities. While those of noble rank acquired their education and promotions as a matter of privilege, Masséna rose from humble origins to such prominence that Napoleon referred to him as "the greatest name of my military Empire." Yet, Masséna's military career was equaled by few commanders in European history. In addition to his remarkable battlefield successes, he touched the careers of many who served under his command. Indeed, at one time or another, a majority of French marshals served under his command and saw "the great Masséna at work."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/ins/scholarship97/c_massena.html |title=INS Scholarship 1997: André Masséna, Prince D'Essling, in the Age of Revolution |publisher=Napoleon-series.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-16[/tpl]

[[Ideological assumption]]
CATEGORIES: Belief

Ideological assumptions are beliefs that often serve as the basis for particular disciplines which go unquestioned within that discipline or as justifications for the actions of a particular society. These assumptions have historically existed in the sciences, including the social sciences, and many argue that they are an implicit part of any society's belief system and continue to exist today. A lack of adherence to a society's or field's ideological assumptions is often grounds for the dismissal of a theory outright before it has been fully considered. Somewhat ironically the term itself is often used to dismiss a particular statement before it has been considered, as in, "there you go again with your ideological assumptions!"
Social scientists especially have been criticized by feminists, queer theorists, and race theorists for maintaining unspoken racist, sexist, imperialistic, homophobic, or otherwise unjustifiably normalizing axioms inherited from previous centuries. Specifically, psychology has frequently been censured for what have proven to be incorrect, and unquestioned, assumptions about the human mind, especially after the fairly recent phenomenon of recovered memories involving Satanic ritual abuse.
The uncovering of ideological assumptions in the field of history tends to raise questions about whether or not a certain level of subjectivity is necessarily a part of historical inquiry.
Some common ideological assumptions, both historical and modern, include:

By 1915, the company was making one carriage every ten minutes.Placard at Western Development Museum.
Under the guidance of "Colonel" Sam McLaughlin as President in 1907, the company began the manufacture of automobiles, eventually forming an alliance for 15 years with the Exchange of $500,000.00 of Buick stock for $500.000.00 of McLaughlin Stock with William C. Durant. Durant had acquired the Buick Motor Company that later would become General Motors Company, a holding company.
During their first few years of operation, the automobiles were known as "McLaughlins". The name was changed to "McLaughlin-Buick" when sales dropped, and returned to "McLaughlin" until 1915 when Chevrolet Motor Company of Canada Limited, owned by McLaughlin, merged both his companies to become General Motors of Canada Limited and allied in 1919 with the Corporation obtaining $10,000,000.00 to build Walkerville plant an establish Canadian Products.. The "McLaughlin" name was eventually dropped altogether, leaving the "Buick" marque still in use today. Until 1914, the cars were finished with the same paints and varnishes used on carriages. This meant each vehicle required up to fifteen coats of paint. McLauglin revolutionized the industry[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] with their painting process.
In 1918, Sam was Director and Vice-President of General Motors Corporation.  The same year he merged the McLaughlin Car Company of Canada and the Chevrolet Car Company of Canada to call it General Motors Car Company of Canada Limited,  Sam McLaughlin would go on to be General Motors Vice President in 1918 when Chevrolet owned 54.6% of General Motors stock of $90,000,000.00 Chevrolet was incorporated in the USA and General Motors of Canada was incorporated when McLaughlin as a large shareholder of General Motors stock allowed it to happen as he had no sons.General Motors Corporation Gave the McLaughlins GM Stocks to become Proprietors of the Canadian Plant as an article in the Financial Post September 23,1933 page 9 states.

Leung Sheung (Chinese: 梁相; 1918 - 1978) was a Chinese martial artist who studied Wing Chun Kung Fu who is known as the senior-most student of Yip Man (葉問) in Hong Kong. Leung Sheung was widely acknowledged for his superior skill and practical application. 
Although being credited with being a premier student of Yip Man, Leung Sheung was an extremely humble man. He spoke about his Wing Chun abilities in overly modest terms, preferring to instead elevate Yip Man's martial prowess. However, being one of the few close-door students of Yip Man while living and studying under him for many years, as well as being Yip Man's first student in Hong Kong, Leung presented Yip Man with obvious reason to train him well. It was Leung Sheung's undeniable abilities that played a significant role in promoting and building Yip Man's Wing Chun in Hong Kong. Leung Sheung, along with Lok Yiu and Chu Shong Tin are considered to be the three closed-door students of Yip Man.

[[Belisha beacon]]

CATEGORIES: Pedestrian crossing components, 1934 introductions, Walking in the United Kingdom, Orange symbols

A Belisha beacon [tpl]IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|l|iː|ʃ|ə[/tpl] is an amber-coloured globe lamp atop a tall black and white pole, marking pedestrian crossings of roads in the United Kingdom, Ireland and in other countries (e.g., Hong Kong, Malta) historically influenced by Britain. It was named after Leslie Hore-Belisha (1893–1957), the Minister of Transport who in 1934 added beacons to pedestrian crossings, marked by large metal studs in the road surface.  These crossings were later painted in black and white stripes, thus are known as zebra crossings.  Legally pedestrians have priority (over wheeled traffic) on such crossings.
Belisha beacons provide additional visibility to zebra crossings for motorists, primarily at night. The flash commonly lasts one second in both on and off states. Some crossings are set so that each beacon flashes alternately to the other side, but they often fall out of synchronisation over time. Beacons with an outer ring of flashing amber LED lights, preferred for their brightness and low electricity consumption, are replacing traditional incandescent bulbs in many areas.
To be legally compliant, every zebra crossing must be equipped with two Belisha beacons.In the UK, in cases where there is a traffic island or central reservation in the road, the traffic authority can opt whether to place one or more beacons centrally.
In recent years[tpl]When|date=February 2011[/tpl] the number of zebra crossings and Belisha beacons has fallen in the northern counties of England, being replaced by pelican crossings or puffin crossings, with pedestrian-controlled traffic signals; a waiting pedestrian can stop vehicular traffic by pressing a button and waiting for the pedestrian signal of a red and green man to change to green. The green man can be accompanied by a green bicycle to indicate that the crossing is designated for pedestrians and cyclists, continuing the bird-name theme, this type of crossing is called a Toucan crossing, as in, 'two can' cross. Another variation is the pegasus crossing where the pedestrian is accompanied by a green horse to indicate that the crossing is designated for pedestrians and horses, for example, at Hyde Park Corner, London.
The first Belisha Beacon was erected in Wigan on the corner of Mesnes Street, and became operational on 4 July 1935.

The Radical Faieries are a loosely-affiliated worldwide network and counter-cultural movement seeking to redefine queer consciousness through spirituality.
Rejecting hetero-imitation, the Radical Faerie movement began during the 1970s sexual revolution among gay men in the United States.[tpl]citation |title=Remembering Harry |first=Mark |last= Thompson |accessdate=2008-10-17 |date=21 January 2003 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SWUEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA24&dq=%22Remembering%20Harry%22%20advocate&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q | periodical=The Advocate |publisher=Here Publishing[/tpl] The movement has expanded in tandem with the larger gay rights movement, challenging commercialization and patriarchal aspects of modern LGBT life while celebrating pagan constructs and rituals. Faeries tend to be fiercely independent, anti-establishment, and community-focused. Faerie culture is undefinable as a group; however, it has similar characteristics to "Marxism, feminism, paganism, Native American and New Age spirituality, anarchism, the mythopoetic men's movement, radical individualism, the therapeutic culture of self-fulfillment and self-actualization, earth-based movements in support of sustainable communities, spiritual solemnity coupled with a camp sensibility, gay liberation and drag."

CATEGORIES: Drum machines, Roland synthesizers, Grooveboxes, 1980 introductions, Roland drum machines

The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer (a.k.a. the "808") was one of the first programmable drum machines ("TR" serving as an initialism for Transistor Rhythm). Introduced by the Roland Corporation in early 1980, it was originally manufactured for use as a tool for studio musicians to create demos. Like earlier Roland drum machines, it does not sound very much like a real drum kit. Indeed, because the TR-808 was released a few months after the Linn LM-1 (the first drum machine to use digital samples), professionals generally considered its sound inferior to sampling drum machines; a 1982 Keyboard Magazine review of the LinnDrum indirectly referred to the TR-808 as sounding like marching anteaters. However, the TR-808 cost US$1,195 upon its release, which was considerably more affordable than the US$5,000 LM-1.

[[Oil spill]]

CATEGORIES: Oil spills, Hazards, Bird mortality, Ocean pollution, Product safety scandals, Road hazards

An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially marine areas, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution.  The term is usually applied to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land.  Oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs and wells, as well as spills of refined petroleum products (such as gasoline, diesel) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as bunker fuel, or the spill of any oily refuse or waste oil.
Spilt oil penetrates into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0322-04.htm |title=Lingering Lessons of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2004-03-22 |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl] Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.[tpl]cite web |url= http://vimeo.com/10216588 |title=Hindsight and Foresight, 20 Years After the Exxon Valdez Spill| accessdate=2010-04-30  |first=NOAA Ocean Media Center| date=2010-03-16 |publisher=NOAA [/tpl]

Kazumi Watanabe (渡辺香津美) is a jazz and jazz fusion  guitarist, from Tokyo, Japan. He was born on October 14, 1953 渡辺 香津美Kazumi Watanabe Biography - ARTISTdirect Music
Kazumi learned to play guitar from Sadanori Nakamure, one of Japan's grandmaster guitarists. Kazumi released his first recording in 1971, and quickly became a promising guitarist in his own right. In 1979, he formed an all-star band with some of Japan's leading studio musicians, and recorded the album Kylyn, which is considered a masterpiece in fusion music.コロムビア LPファクトリー／渡辺香津美／KYLYN
During the eighties Watanabe released a considerable number of jazz-rock albums. To Chi Ka (1980), with its funk influences and bright sound, is probably the most famous early title. Some latter albums, such as Mobo Club (1983) and Mobo Splash (1985) display more experimental tendencies. But the most famous of all is Spice of Life (1987) which is written in a strongly melodic style. A DVD has been issued from the tour in which the music was played with drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Jeff Berlin (who also play on the studio record). In the 1990s Kazumi assembled an all-Japanese line-up called Resonance Vox (Vagabonde Suzuki on bass, Rikiya Higashihara on drums, Tomohiro Yahiro on percussion). This band has released several adventurous fusion albums.
Watanabe has worked with numerous musicians such as Steve Gadd, Tony Levin, Jeff Berlin, Bill Bruford, Sly and Robbie, Wayne Shorter, Patrick Moraz, Marcus Miller, Richard Bona, and Peter Erskine. Since 1996, he has been a visiting professor of music at Senzoku Gakuen College. He endorses Steinberger and Paul Reed Smith guitars, and has been chosen Best Jazzman 24 years in a row by Swing Journal magazine's annual poll. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1929 novels, Novels by Anthony Berkeley, Novels set in London, William Collins, Sons books

The Poisoned Chocolates Case (1929) is a detective novel by Anthony Berkeley set in 1920s London in which a group of armchair detectives, who have founded the "Crimes Circle", formulate theories on a recent murder case Scotland Yard has been unable to solve. Each of the six members, including their president, Berkeley's amateur sleuth Roger Sheringham, arrives at an altogether different solution as to the motive and the identity of the perpetrator, and also applies different methods of detection (basically deductive or inductive or a combination of both). Completely devoid of brutality but containing a lot of subtle, tongue-in-cheek humour instead, The Poisoned Chocolates Case is one of the classic whodunnits of the so-called Golden Age of detective fiction. As at least six plausible explanations of what really happened are put forward one after the other, the reader—just like the members of the Crimes Circle themselves—is kept guessing right up to the final pages of the book.

[[Radiator]]

CATEGORIES: Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning, Plumbing, Residential heating appliances, Russian inventions, Vehicle parts

Radiators are heat exchangers used to transfer thermal energy from one medium to another for the purpose of cooling and heating. The majority of radiators are constructed to function in automobiles, buildings, and electronics. The radiator is always a source of heat to its environment, although this may be for either the purpose of heating this environment, or for cooling the fluid or coolant supplied to it, as for engine cooling. Despite the name, radiators generally transfer the bulk of their heat via convection, not by thermal radiation, though the term "convector" is used more narrowly; see radiation and convection, below.
The Roman hypocaust, a type of radiator for building space heating, was described in 15 AD. The heating radiator was invented by Franz San Galli, a Polish-born Russian businessman living in St. Petersburg, between 1855 and 1857.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gruner-fam.de/SanGalli-E.html |title=Family Sangalli / San Galli |publisher=Gruner-fam.de |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20[/tpl]The hot boxes of San Galli [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]

[[Ekpyrotic universe]]

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics, Physical cosmology

The ekpyrotic universe, or ekpyrotic scenario, is a cosmological model of the origin and shape of the universe. The name comes from a Stoic term ekpyrosis (Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἐκπύρωσις[/tpl] ekpurōsis) meaning conflagration or in Stoic usage "conversion into fire".'the dissolution of the universe into fire'. In Stoic philosophy, ekpyrosis, all-engulfing cosmic fire, represents the contractive phase of eternally-recurring destruction and re-creation. On "ekpyrosis" see generally Michael Lapidge, 'Stoic Cosmology,' in John M. Rist, The Stoics, Cambridge University Press, 1978 pp.161-186, pp.180-184 The ekpyrotic model of the universe is an alternative to the standard cosmic inflation model for the very early universe; both models accommodate the standard Big Bang Lambda-CDM model of our universe.Jean-Luc Lehners (2010) "Ekpyrotic Nongaussianity: A Review" Advances in Astronomy 2010:903907, 19 pp.[ref]Justin Khoury and Paul J. Steinhardt (2010) "Adiabatic Ekpyrosis: Scale-Invariant Curvature Perturbations from a Single Scalar Field in a Contracting Universe" Phys. Rev. Lett. 104(9):91301, 4 pp. (preprint)
[/ref] The ekpyrotic model is a precursor to, and part of, some cyclic models.
The ekpyrotic model came out of work by Neil Turok and Paul Steinhardt and maintains that the universe did not start in a singularity, but came about from the collision of two branes. This collision avoids the primordial singularity and superluminal expansion of spacetime while preserving nearly scale-free density fluctuations and other features of the observed universe. The ekpyrotic model is cyclic, though collisions between branes are rare on the time scale of the expansion of the universe to a nearly featureless flat expanse. Observations that may distinguish between the ekpyrotic and inflationary models include polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation and frequency distribution of the gravitational wave spectrum.

[[Exhaust gas recirculation]]
CATEGORIES: Engine technology, Chemical process engineering, Air pollution control systems, NOx control

In internal combustion engines, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reduction technique used in petrol/gasoline and diesel engines.  EGR works by recirculating a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders.  In a gasoline engine, this inert exhaust displaces the amount of combustible matter in the cylinder. In a diesel engine, the exhaust gas replaces some of the excess oxygen in the pre-combustion mixture.Exhaust Emissions and Driveability — Chrysler Corporation, 1973 Because NOx forms primarily when a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is subjected to high temperature, the lower combustion chamber temperatures caused by EGR reduces the amount of NOx the combustion generates (though at some loss of engine efficiency).[tpl]cite web |url=http://autos.yahoo.com/maintain/repairqa/engine/ques080_1.html |title=What is the EGR valve and what does it do? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= Yahoo! Autos|accessdate=22 March 2011[/tpl] Gasses re-introduced from EGR systems will also contain near equilibrium concentrations of NOx and CO; the small fraction initially within the combustion chamber inhibits the total net production of these and other pollutants when sampled on a time average. Most modern engines now require exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards.

[[Power-to-weight ratio]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanics, Power (physics), Engineering ratios

Power-to-weight ratio (or specific power or power-to-mass ratio) is a calculation commonly applied to engines and mobile power sources to enable the comparison of one unit or design to another. Power-to-weight ratio is a measurement of actual performance of any engine or power source. It is also used as a measurement of performance of a vehicle as a whole, with the engine's power output being divided by the weight (or mass) of the vehicle, to give a metric that is independent of the vehicle's size. Power-to-weight is often quoted by manufacturers at the peak value, but the actual value may vary in use and variations will affect performance.
The inverse of power-to-weight, weight-to-power ratio (power loading) is a calculation commonly applied to aircraft, cars, and vehicles in general, to enable the comparison of one vehicle's performance to another. Power-to-weight ratio is equal to thrust per unit mass multiplied by the velocity of any vehicle.

The West Lothian question refers to the debate in the United Kingdom over whether members of parliament from outside England – from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales – can vote on matters that affect only England.
The name "West Lothian question" was coined after Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for the Scottish constituency of West Lothian, raised the matter in 1977 during a British House of Commons debate over Scottish and Welsh devolution.[tpl]cite news|title=West Lothian commission: Sir Emyr Jones Parry joins body|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-16594376|accessdate=25 March 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=17 January 2012[/tpl] Since the beginning of Devolution and especially the establishment in the 1990s of the new Welsh and Northern Irish Assemblies and Scottish Parliament, this question has taken on a new urgency. In September 2011, it was announced that the UK government was to set up a commission to examine the West Lothian question.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14831619|title=Answer sought to the West Lothian question|date=8 September 2011|publisher=BBC News Scotland|accessdate=8 September 2011[/tpl] 
The Commission on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons was chaired by Sir William McKay, former Clerk of the House of Commons.  Its report was published in March 2013.  It proposed various procedural changes, including the recommendation that legislation that affects only England should normally require the support of a majority of MPs who represent English constituencies.[tpl]cite report| url=http://tmc.independent.gov.uk/report-of-the-commission-on-the-consequences-of-devolution-for-the-house-of-commons | title=Report of McKay Commission | date= 25 March 2013[/tpl]BBC News, England-only laws 'need majority from English MPs' , 25 March 2013.

[[Stratified charge engine]]
CATEGORIES: Internal combustion piston engines

In a stratified charge engine, the fuel is injected into the cylinder just before ignition. This allows for higher compression ratios without "knock," and leaner air/fuel mixtures than in conventional internal combustion engines.
Conventionally, a four-stroke (petrol or gasoline) Otto cycle engine is fuelled by drawing a mixture of air and fuel into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke. This produces a homogeneous charge: a homogeneous mixture of air and fuel, which is ignited by a spark plug at a predetermined moment near the top of the compression stroke.
In a homogeneous charge system, the air/fuel ratio is kept very close to stoichiometric. A stoichiometric mixture contains the exact amount of air necessary for a complete combustion of the fuel. This gives stable combustion, but places an upper limit on the engine's efficiency: any attempt to improve fuel economy by running a lean mixture with a homogeneous charge results in unstable combustion; this impacts on power and emissions, notably of nitrogen oxides or NOx.
If the Otto cycle is abandoned, however, and fuel is injected directly into the combustion-chamber during the compression stroke, the petrol engine is liberated from a number of its limitations.
First, a higher mechanical compression ratio (or, with supercharged engines, maximum combustion pressure) may be used for better thermodynamic efficiency. Since fuel is not present in the combustion chamber until virtually the point at which combustion is required to begin, there is no risk of pre-ignition or engine knock.
The engine may also run on a much leaner overall air/fuel ratio, using stratified charge.
Combustion can be problematic if a lean mixture is present at the spark-plug. However, fueling a petrol engine directly allows more fuel to be directed towards the spark-plug than elsewhere in the combustion-chamber. This results in a stratified charge: one in which the air/fuel ratio is not homogeneous throughout the combustion-chamber, but varies in a controlled (and potentially quite complex) way across the volume of the cylinder.
A relatively rich air/fuel mixture is directed to the spark-plug using multi-hole injectors. This mixture is sparked, giving a strong, even and predictable flame-front. This in turn results in a high-quality combustion of the much weaker mixture elsewhere in the cylinder.
Direct fuelling of petrol engines is rapidly becoming the norm, as it offers considerable advantages over port-fuelling (in which the fuel injectors are placed in the intake ports, giving homogeneous charge), with the only drawbacks being increase injector cost and complexity, higher fuel pressure requirements, carbon build up on the back of the intake valve[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] due to the lack of gasoline passing by the intake valve to act as a cleaning agent for the valve on traditional multiport injection designs. Powerful electronic management systems mean that there is no significant cost penalty.
With the further impetus of tightening emissions legislation, the motor industry in Europe and North America has now switched completely to direct fuelling for the new petrol engines it is introducing.
It is worth comparing contemporary directly-fuelled petrol engines with direct-injection diesels. Petrol can burn faster than diesel fuel, allowing higher maximum engine speeds and thus greater maximum power for sporting engines. Diesel fuel, on the other hand, has a higher energy density, and in combination with higher combustion pressures can deliver very strong torque and high thermodynamic efficiency for more 'normal' road vehicles.

UQAM was founded on April 9, 1969 by the government of Quebec, through the merger of the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal, a fine arts school; the Collège Sainte-Marie, a classical college; and a number of smaller schools. Although part of the UQ network, UQAM possesses a relative independence which allows it to print its own diplomas and choose its rector.
In 2011, UQAM had a student population of 41,325 in six faculties (Arts, Education, Communication, Political Science and Law, Science and Social science) and one school (Management). It offers Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral degrees. It is one of Montreal's two francophone universities, along with the Université de Montréal, and only 1% of its student population is of anglophone origin.

A toucan crossing is a type of pedestrian crossing found in the United Kingdom that also allows bicycles to be ridden across.The Highway Code, Rule 80  Since two-can, both pedestrians and cyclists, cross together, the name toucan was chosen.
In the UK, toucan crossings are normally 4 metres (13 feet) wide, instead of the 2.8-metre (9 feet) width of a pelican crossing or puffin crossing. 
There are two types of Toucan crossing: on more recent ones a "green bicycle" is displayed next to the "green man" when cyclists and pedestrians are permitted to cross and a red bicycle and man are show at other times; older ones do not have a red bicycle – bicycles are permitted to cross at any time (if it is safe to do so).Cyclecraft, p199.
Unlike the pelican crossing, before the lights for vehicles go back to green, a steady red and amber are displayed instead of a flashing amber.
The pedestrian/cyclist signal lights may be on the near side of the crossing (like a puffin crossing), or on the opposite side of the road (like a pelican crossing).
A related crossing type pegasus crossing for horse riders.

Hanja is the Korean name for Chinese characters (hanzi).[tpl]cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The writing systems of the world|year=1991|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-18028-9|page=116|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VOywmavmZ3UC[/tpl]  More specifically, it refers to those Chinese characters borrowed from Chinese and incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. Hanja-mal or hanja-eo refers to words which can be written with hanja, and hanmun ([tpl]lang|ko|한문[/tpl], [tpl]lang|ko|漢文[/tpl]) refers to Classical Chinese writing, although "hanja" is sometimes used loosely to encompass these other concepts. Because hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to traditional Chinese and kyūjitai characters. Only a small number of hanja characters are modified or unique to Korean. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japan (kanji) and Mainland China have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding hanja characters.
Although a phonetic Korean alphabet, now known as hangul, had been created by a team of scholars commissioned in the 1440s by King Sejong the Great, it did not come into widespread use until the late 19th and early 20th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Fischer|first=Stephen Roger|title=A History of Writing|publisher=Reaktion Books|series=Globalities|pages=189–194|isbn=1-86189-101-6|location=London|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ywo0M9OpbXoC&pg=PA189|accessdate=2009-04-03|date=2004-04-04[/tpl]  Thus, until that time it was necessary to be fluent in reading and writing hanja in order to be literate in Korean, as the vast majority of Korean literature and most other Korean documents were written in hanja. Today, a good working knowledge of Chinese characters is still important for anyone who wishes to study older texts (up to about the 1990s), or anyone who wishes to read scholarly texts in the humanities. Learning a certain number of hanja is very helpful to understanding the etymology of Sinokorean words, and to enlarging one's Korean vocabulary.  Hanja are not used to write native Korean words, which are always rendered in hangul, and even words of Chinese origin — hanja-eo (한자어, 漢字語) — are written with the hangul alphabet most of the time.[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl]

[[Q-switching]]

CATEGORIES: Laser science

Q-switching, sometimes known as giant pulse formation, is a technique by which a laser can be made to produce a pulsed output beam. The technique allows the production of light pulses with extremely high (gigawatt) peak power, much higher than would be produced by the same laser if it were operating in a continuous wave (constant output) mode. Compared to modelocking, another technique for pulse generation with lasers, Q-switching leads to much lower pulse repetition rates, much higher pulse energies, and much longer pulse durations. The two techniques are sometimes applied together.
Q-switching was first proposed in 1958 by Gordon Gould,[tpl]cite book |last=Taylor |first=Nick |title=LASER: The inventor, the Nobel laureate, and the thirty-year patent war |year=2000 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-684-83515-0 [/tpl] p. 93. and independently discovered and demonstrated in 1961 or 1962 by R.W.

[[Helmand River]]

CATEGORIES: Helmand River, Rivers of Afghanistan, Helmand River drainage basin, Rivers of Iran, International rivers of Asia

The Helmand River (also spelled Helmend, Helmund, Hirmand; Pashto/Persian:  [tpl]lang|fa|هیرمند, هلمند[/tpl] [tpl]lang|fa-Latn|Hīrmand, Helmand[/tpl], Greek: [tpl]lang|la|Ἐτύμανδρος[/tpl] (Etýmandros), Latin: [tpl]lang|la|Erymandrus[/tpl]) is the longest river in Afghanistan and the primary watershed for the endorheic Sistan Basin. 
The name comes from Avestan Haētumant, literally "dammed, having a dam", cognate with Sanskrit Setumanta "having a dam", which referred to the Helmand River and the irrigated areas around it.Jack Finegan. Myth & Mystery: An Introduction to the Pagan Religions of the Biblical World. Baker Books, 1997. ISBN 0-8010-2160-X, 9780801021602 The name was borrowed into Greek and Latin as a compound with Eastern Iranian *raha (cf. Scythian Rha "Volga"), "river". Helmand Province is named after the river. 
The Helmand River stretches for [tpl]convert|1,150|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. It rises in the Hindu Kush mountains, about [tpl]convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] west of Kabul ([tpl]coord|34|34|N|68|33|E[/tpl]), passing north of the Unai Pass,in the eastern proximities of Hazarajat, in Behsud, flows west to Daykundi and Uruzgan. It crosses south-west through the desert of Dashti Margo, to the Seistan marshes and the Hamun-i-Helmand lake region around Zabol at the Afghan-Iranian border ([tpl]coord|31|9|N|61|33|E[/tpl]).
The river remains relatively salt-free for much of its length, unlike most rivers with no outlet to the sea[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]. This river, managed by the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority is used extensively for irrigation, although a buildup of mineral salts has decreased its usefulness in watering crops. Its waters are essential for farmers in Afghanistan, but it feeds into Lake Hamun and is also important to farmers in Iran's southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province.
A number of hydroelectric dams have created artificial reservoirs on some of the Afghanistan's rivers including the Kajakai on the Helmand River. The chief tributary of the Helmand river is the Arghandab River (confluence at [tpl]coord|31|27|N|64|23|E|[/tpl]) which also has a major dam north of Kandahar.
The boundaries of the province of Helmand were once known as kingdom of Sakastan.

[[Ain't Misbehavin' (musical)]]

CATEGORIES: 1978 musicals, Broadway musicals, All-Black cast Broadway shows, Drama Desk Award winning musicals, The Muppets songs, Jukebox musicals, Tony Award for Best Musical

Ain't Misbehavin' is a musical revue with a book by Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby, Jr., and music by various composers and lyricists.  It is named after the song by Fats Waller (with Harry Brooks and Andy Razaf), "Ain't Misbehavin'".
The musical is a tribute to the black musicians of the 1920s and '30s who were part of the Harlem Renaissance, an era of growing creativity, cultural awareness, and ethnic pride, and takes its title from the 1929 Waller song "Ain't Misbehavin'". It was a time when Manhattan nightclubs like the Cotton Club and the Savoy Ballroom were the playgrounds of high society and Lenox Avenue dives were filled with piano players banging out the new beat known as swing. Five performers present an evening of rowdy, raunchy, and humorous songs that encapsulate the various moods of the era and reflect Waller's view of life as a journey meant for pleasure and play.

The Napier Sabre was a British H-24-cylinder, liquid cooled, sleeve valve, piston aero engine, designed by Major Frank Halford and built by Napier & Son during World War II. The engine evolved to become one of the most powerful inline piston aircraft engines in the world developing from 2,200 horsepower (1,640 kW) in its earlier versions to [tpl]convert|3500|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] in late-model prototypes.[tpl]cite web|last=Wintjens|first=Piet|title=Napier Sabre|url=http://www.hawkertempest.se/NapierSabre1.htm|work=The Hawker Tempest Page|accessdate=17 June 2012[/tpl]
The first operational aircraft to be powered by the Sabre were the Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tempest;
however, the first aircraft powered by the Sabre was the Napier-Heston Racer, which was designed to capture the world speed record[tpl]#tag:ref|The Napier-Heston Racer used the first production Sabre engine.

Other aircraft using the Sabre were early prototype and production variants of the Blackburn Firebrand, the Martin-Baker MB 3 prototype and one of the Hawker Fury prototypes. The rapid conversion to jet engines after the war led to the quick demise of the Sabre, because Napier also turned to developing jet engines.

[[Spatha]]

CATEGORIES: Roman swords, Ancient Roman legionary equipment, Cavalry

The spatha was a type of straight and long sword, measuring between [tpl]convert|0.75|and|1|m|in|abbr=on[/tpl], in use throughout first millennium AD Europe, and in the territory of the Roman Empire until about 600 AD. Later swords from 600 AD to 1000 AD, like the viking swords, are recognizable derivatives, though they are not truly spathae.
The spatha was used in war and in gladiatorial fights. The spatha of literature appears in the Roman Empire in the first century AD as a weapon used by presumably Germanic auxiliaries and gradually became a standard heavy infantry weapon, relegating the gladius to use as a light infantry weapon. The spatha apparently replaced the gladius in the front ranks, giving the infantry more reach when thrusting. While the infantry version had a long point, versions carried by the cavalry had a rounded tip that prevented accidental stabbing of the cavalryman's foot.
Archaeologically many instances of the spatha have been found in Britain and Germany. It was used extensively by Germanic warriors. It is unclear whether it came from the Pompeii gladius or the longer Celtic swords, or whether it served as a model for the various broadswords and Viking swords of Europe. The spatha remained popular throughout the Migration Period. It may have evolved into the knightly sword of the High Middle Ages from about 1100 AD, but the large number of sword types that appeared during the period make it difficult to establish links. The details of their manufacture remain mostly unknown.

Randolph Scott (January 23, 1898 – March 2, 1987) was an American film actor whose career spanned from 1928 to 1962. As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, comedies, musicals (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, war films, and even a few horror and fantasy films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle Western hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances more than 60 were in Westerns; thus, "of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it."Boscombe, Edward (ed). The BFI Companion to the Western. New York: DiCapo Press, 1988.
Scott's more than 30 years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working with many acclaimed screen directors, including Henry King, Rouben Mamoulian, Michael Curtiz, John Cromwell, King Vidor, Allan Dwan, Fritz Lang, and Sam Peckinpah. He also worked on multiple occasions with prominent directors: Henry Hathaway (eight times), Ray Enright (seven), Edwin R. Marin (seven), André de Toth (six), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with Budd Boetticher. Scott also worked with a diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from Shirley Temple and Irene Dunne to Mae West and Marlene Dietrich.
Tall (6 ft 2.5 in; 189 cm), lanky, and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or "lumbering".Mueller 1985, p. 65. As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal "strong, silent" type of stoic hero. The BFI Companion to the Western noted: In his earlier Westerns ... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude. 
During the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual Motion Picture Herald Top Ten Polls, he ranked 10th in 1950, eighth in 1951, and again 10th in 1952.Nott 2004, p. 4. Scott also appeared in the Quigley's Top Ten Money Makers Poll from 1950 to 1953."Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years." quigleypublishing.com. Retrieved June 9, 2012.

Even Stevens is an American comedy television series that aired on Disney Channel with a total of three seasons and 65 episodes from June 17, 2000, to June 13, 2003. It follows the life of the Stevenses, a Jewish family living in suburban Sacramento, California, mainly focusing on the clashing personalities of its two younger siblings, Ren and Louis.
The series was produced by Brookwell McNamara Entertainment and Fireworks Entertainment. It is often cited as launching Shia LaBeouf's breakout career as an actor. The show features a fast motion photography, which features in every episode.
The feature-length Disney Channel Original Movie based on the series, The Even Stevens Movie, premiered on June 13, 2003, and serves as the series finale.
As of January 15, 2010, in America, Even Stevens has been removed from television syndication altogether, though The Even Stevens Movie continues to air on Disney Channel and Teen Nick, and on Family Channel occasionally. However, in the UK, Even Stevens continues to air on CITV and now Pop Girl. From its launch on June 1, 2011 to late 2012, the series were shown as re-runs on Disney XD in Canada & US.

[[Transect]]
CATEGORIES: Scientific observation, Ecological techniques, Environmental statistics

A transect is a path along which one counts and records occurrences of the phenomena of study (e.g. plants).
It requires an observer to move along a fixed path and to count occurrences along the path and, at the same time (in some procedures), obtain the distance of the object from the path.  This results in an estimate of the area covered and an estimate of the way in which detectability increases from probability 0 (far from the path) towards 1 (near the path).  Using the raw count and this probability function, one can arrive at an estimate of the actual density of objects.
The estimation of the abundance of populations (such as terrestrial mammal species) can be achieved using a number of different types of transect methods, such as strip transects, line transects, belt transects, point transectsBuckland, S.T., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P and Laake, J.L. 1993.

Mauna Loa is the largest subaerial volcano in both mass and volume, and has historically been considered the largest volcano on Earth. It is an active shield volcano, with a volume estimated at approximately [tpl]convert|18000|mi3|km3[/tpl],[tpl]cite conference|last=Kaye|first=G.D.|title=Using GIS to estimate the total volume of Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002CD/finalprogram/abstract_34712.htm|booktitle=98th Annual Meeting|conference=Geological Society of America|year=2002[/tpl] although its peak is about [tpl]convert|120|ft|m|0[/tpl] lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea.

Mauna Loa has probably been erupting for at least 700,000 years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000 years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000 years.[tpl]cite web | url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/maunaloa/ | title = Mauna Loa: Earth's Largest Volcano | date = February 2, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-28| publisher = United States Geological Survey [/tpl] The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which has been responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years. The slow drift of the Pacific Plate will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the hotspot within 500,000 to one million years from now, at which point it will become extinct.
Mauna Loa's most recent eruption occurred from March 24 to April 15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century. Based on the hazards it poses to population centers, Mauna Loa is part of the Decade Volcanoes program, which encourages studies of the world's most dangerous volcanoes. Mauna Loa has been monitored intensively by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory since 1912. Observations of the atmosphere are undertaken at the Mauna Loa Observatory, and of the Sun at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, both located near the mountain's summit. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park covers the summit and the southeastern flank of the volcano, and also incorporates Kīlauea, a separate volcano.

[[Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses]]
CATEGORIES: Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses, Criticism of religion

Jehovah's Witnesses have attracted criticism from mainstream Christianity, some members of the medical community, some former members and some commentators over their beliefs and practices. The religion has been accused of doctrinal inconsistency and reversals, failed predictions, mistranslation of the Bible, harsh treatment of former members and autocratic and coercive leadership. Criticism has also focused on their rejection of blood transfusions, particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and claims that they have failed to report cases of sexual abuse to the authorities. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.

[[Dir (command)]]
CATEGORIES: Internal DOS commands, Windows administration, Microcomputer software

In computing, dir (directory) is a command used for file and directory listing, specifically in the command line interface (CLI) of these operating systems: RT-11, CP/M, VMS, DOS, OS/2, Singularity, and Microsoft Windows. It is analogous to the Unix ls command.
Because it is the primary means of displaying the files and directories on disk or other storage medium within a command window, the dir command is one of the most basic commands employed by users of the command line interface to MS-DOS and subsequent versions of Microsoft Windows.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tnd.com/camosun/elex130/dostutor1.html |title=Learning MS-DOS Basics - A Tutorial |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last=Baril |first=Suzanne |date=2000-01-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070709072247/http://tnd.com/camosun/elex130/dostutor1.html  |archivedate = 2007-07-09[/tpl]
The dir command has existed as a DOS command since the initial release of MS-DOS. It is built into the DOS command shell, and is not provided as a separate standalone program.
In DOS and Microsoft Windows, dir checks for switches in the %dircmd% environment variable.
In Windows PowerShell, dir is a predefined command alias for the Get-ChildItem Cmdlet which basically serves the same purpose.

Dora Webber and Cora Webber (born 1958) are twin sisters who participate in women's boxing.[tpl]cite book|title=The boxer's heart: how I fell in love with the ring|year=2000|publisher=Villard|isbn=978-0-375-50395-5|pages=15, 129|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e6G1AAAAIAAJ&q=Dora+and+Cora+Webber&dq=Dora+and+Cora+Webber|author=Kate Sekules|accessdate=12 January 2011[/tpl] They are from the U.S. state of California. It is believed that at one time, they were the only set of twins to actively participate on boxing's women's leg.
Cora Webber was a participant in the sport of karate before she discovered boxing in 1979, and she allegedly left karate because she kept on being disqualified on her karate fights. Her sister Dora followed her footsteps five years later.
The Webbers were among the most popular female boxers of the 1980s and kept on facing top opposition well into the 1990s.
Cora's first fight was against a woman named Toni Lear. Cora won the fight by a decision, earning 100 dollars for her efforts. She put a string of wins together, and was able to win the California State women's title. After that, she had a chance to spar with men's Welterweight world champion Carlos Palomino in Los Angeles.
In 1984, Dora followed suit and began a professional boxing career of her own. Her first opponent happened to be none other than her sister's former rival Lear, who, upon meeting Dora, thought that she was fighting Cora and that Cora was just trying to pull some kind of scam. After she was presented with proof that she wasn't fighting Cora but her twin sister Dora, Dora proceeded to beat her by a knockout.
Cora has fought, among others, Lady Tiger Trimiar, who was beaten twice by Cora, Belinda Laracuente, who also lost to her, and Bonnie Canino, who defeated her by decision.  She was the IWBF world Lightweight champion, but lost that honor when she fought a unification bout to the IFBA world champion Zulfia Koutdoussova on January 10, 1998 by a decision in Atlantic City.
Dora, meanwhile, who has fought Lucia Rijker, was a world champion on the Jr. Middleweight division until she lost the IFBA belt a month after her sister's defeat at the hands of Koutdoussova, by a ten round decision to Gina Guidi.

Oedipus at Colonus (also Oedipus Coloneus, [tpl]lang-grc|Οἰδίπους ἐπὶ Κολωνῷ[/tpl], Oidipous epi Kolōnō) is one of the three Theban plays of the Athenian tragedian Sophocles.  It was written shortly before Sophocles' death in 406 BC and produced by his grandson (also called Sophocles) at the Festival of Dionysus in 401 BC.
In the timeline of the plays, the events of Oedipus at Colonus occur after Oedipus the King and before Antigone; however, it was the last of Sophocles' three Theban plays to be written. The play describes the end of Oedipus' tragic life. Legends differ as to the site of Oedipus' death; Sophocles set the place at Colonus, a village near Athens and also Sophocles' own birthplace, where the blinded Oedipus has come with his daughters Antigone and Ismene as suppliants of the Erinyes and of Theseus, the king of Athens.

Carlin and his "Seven dirty words" comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5–4 decision by the justices affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material on the public airwaves.

The first of his 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of American culture. In 2004, Carlin was placed second on the Comedy Central list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians, ahead of Lenny Bruce and behind Richard Pryor.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm|title=Stand Up Comedy & Comedians|accessdate=August 10, 2006|publisher=Comedy Zone[/tpl] He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live.

[[Writ of prohibition]]
CATEGORIES: Prerogative writs

A writ of prohibition is a writ directing a subordinate to stop doing something the law prohibits.  In practice, the Court directs the Clerk to issue the Writ, and directs the Sheriff to serve it on the subordinate, and the Clerk prepares the Writ and gives it to the Sheriff, who serves it.
This writ is normally issued by a superior court to the lower court asking it not to proceed with a case which does not fall under its jurisdiction.
These Writs are issued as "alternative" or "peremptory".  An alternative Writ directs the recipient to immediately act, or desist, and "Show Cause" why the directive should not be made permanent.  A peremptory Writ directs the recipient to immediately act, or desist, and "return" the Writ, with certification of its compliance, within a certain time.
When an agency of an official body is the target of the Writ of Prohibition, the Writ is directed to the official body over which the court has direct jurisdiction, ordering the official body to cause the agency to desist.
Although the rest of this article speaks to judicial processes, a writ of prohibition may be directed by any court of record (i.e., higher than a misdemeanor court) toward any official body, whether a court or a county, city or town government, that is within the court's jurisdiction.

[[Procedendo]]

CATEGORIES: Prerogative writs

In common-law jurisprudence, procedendo is one of the prerogative writs. It is a writ that sends a case from an appellate court to a lower court with an order to proceed to judgment. 
"The writ of procedendo is merely an order from a court of superior jurisdiction to one of inferior jurisdiction to proceed to judgment. It does not in any case attempt to control the inferior court as to what that judgment should be."State ex rel. Davey v. Owen, 133 Ohio St. 96, 106 (Ohio 1937).
The writ of procedendo ad judicium was the earliest remedy for the refusal or neglect of justice on the part of the courts. It was an original writ, issuing out of chancery to the judges of any subordinate court, commanding them in the king's name to proceed to judgment, but without specifying any particular judgment. In case of disobedience or of neglect on the part of the judges to whom it was addressed, or refusal by them to act, they were liable to punishment for contempt.
Inherently, the most important limitation on this jurisdiction is that the writ of mandamus is not a proper remedy to control or direct the decisions of inferior courts in matters wherein they have judicial cognizance and discretion. In other words, so far as the writ affects the action of inferior courts, its use is not to be extended to compel the rendition of a particular judgment, in accordance with the views of a higher court.In re Press Printers & Publishers, Inc., 12 F.2d 660, 664 (3d Cir. 1926)
It corresponds to certiorari, except that certiorari is a higher court's order to a lower court to send the record of a case to it for appellate review.

[[Arsenopyrite]]
CATEGORIES: Iron minerals, Sulfide minerals, Arsenic minerals, Monoclinic minerals

Arsenopyrite is an iron arsenic sulfide (FeAsS). It is a hard (Mohs 5.5-6) metallic, opaque, steel grey to silver white mineral with a relatively high specific gravity of 6.1.  When dissolved in nitric acid, it releases elemental sulfur.  When arsenopyrite is heated, it becomes magnetic and gives off toxic fumes.  With 46% arsenic content, arsenopyrite, along with orpiment, is a principal ore of arsenic.  When deposits of arsenopyrite become exposed to the atmosphere, usually due to mining, the mineral will slowly oxidize, converting the arsenic into oxides that are more soluble in water, leading to acid mine drainage.
The crystal habit, hardness, density, and garlic odor when struck are diagnostic. Arsenopyrite in older literature may be referred to as mispickel, a name of German origin.Mindat Mispickel
Arsenopyrite also can be associated with significant amounts of gold. Consequently it serves as an indicator of gold bearing reefs. Many arsenopyrite gold ores are refractory, i.e. the gold is not easily liberated from the mineral matrix.
Arsenopyrite is found in high temperature hydrothermal veins, in pegmatites, and in areas of contact metamorphism or metasomatism.

Chalcopyrite ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|l|k|ɵ|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|aɪ|t[/tpl] [tpl]respell|KAL|ko|PY|ryt[/tpl]) is a copper iron sulfide mineral that crystallizes in the tetragonal system. It has the chemical composition CuFeS2. It has a brassy to golden yellow color and a hardness of 3.5 to 4 on the Mohs scale. Its streak is diagnostic as green tinged black.
On exposure to air, chalcopyrite oxidises to a variety of oxides, hydroxides and sulfates. Associated copper minerals include the sulfides bornite (Cu5FeS4), chalcocite (Cu2S), covellite (CuS), digenite (Cu9S5); carbonates such as malachite and azurite, and rarely oxides such as cuprite (Cu2O). Chalcopyrite is rarely found in association with native copper.

An English authority states about the maxims of equity: "The Maxims do not cover the whole ground, and moreover they overlap, one maxim contains by implication what belongs to another. Indeed it would not be difficult to reduce all under two: 'Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy' and 'Equity acts on the person'".

A cover-up is an attempt, whether successful or not, to conceal evidence of wrongdoing, error, incompetence or other embarrassing information. In a passive cover-up, information is simply not provided; in an active cover-up, deception is used.
The expression is usually applied to people in positions of authority who abuse their power to avoid or silence criticism or to deflect guilt of wrongdoing. Those who initiate a cover-up (or their allies) may be responsible for a misdeed, a breach of trust or duty or a crime.
While the terms are often used interchangeably, cover-up involves withholding incriminatory evidence, while whitewash involves releasing misleading evidence.

The Teapot Dome scandal was a bribery incident that took place in the United States from 1920 to 1923, during the administration of President Warren G. Harding. Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall leased Navy petroleum reserves at Teapot Dome in Wyoming and two other locations in California to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding. In 1922 and 1923, the leases became the subject of a sensational investigation by Senator Thomas J. Walsh. Fall was later convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies.
Before the Watergate scandal, Teapot Dome was regarded as the "greatest and most sensational scandal in the history of American politics".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php |title= Graft and Oil: How Teapot Dome Became the Greatest Political Scandal of its Time |last=Cherny |first=Robert W |work=History Now |publisher=Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History | accessdate =May 27, 2010[/tpl]  The scandal damaged the public reputation of the Harding administration, which was already severely diminished by its poor handling of the Great Railroad Strike of 1922 and the President's veto of the Bonus Bill in 1922.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant-Eisenhower/Warren-G-Harding-Domestic-and-foreign-affairs.html | title = Grant-Eisenhower | contribution = Warren G Harding: Domestic & foreign affairs | publisher = President profiles[/tpl].

CiteSeer was a public search engine and digital library for scientific and academic papers, primarily in the fields of computer and information science that has been replaced by CiteSeer''X''. Many consider it to be the first academic paper search engine. It became public in 1998 and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time. These included:
It is often considered to be the first automated citation indexing system and was considered a predecessor of academic search tools such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] CiteSeer-like engines and archives usually only harvest documents from publicly available websites and do not crawl publisher websites. As such authors whose documents are freely available are more likely to be represented in the index.
CiteSeer's goal is to improve the dissemination and access of academic and scientific literature. As a non-profit service that can be freely used by anyone, it has been considered as part of the open access movement that is attempting to change academic and scientific publishing to allow greater access to scientific literature. CiteSeer freely provided Open Archives Initiative metadata of all indexed documents and links indexed documents when possible to other sources of metadata such as DBLP and the ACM Portal. To promote open data, CiteSeer''X'' shares its data with other researchers under a Creative Commons license.
The name can be construed to have at least two explanations. As a pun, a 'sightseer' is a tourist who looks at the sights, so a 'cite seer' would be a researcher who looks at cited papers. Another is a 'seer' is a prophet and a 'cite seer' is a prophet of citations. CiteSeer changed its name to ResearchIndex at one point and then changed it back.

New Urbanism is an urban design movement which promotes walkable neighborhoods containing a range of housing and job types. It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually informed many aspects of real estate development, urban planning, and municipal land-use strategies.
New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design standards that were prominent until the rise of the automobile in the mid-20th century; it encompasses principles such as traditional neighborhood design (TND) and transit-oriented development (TOD).Kelbaugh, Douglas S. 2002. Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited. Seattle: University of Washington Press. 161. It is also closely related to regionalism, environmentalism and the broader concept of smart growth. The movement also includes a more pedestrian-oriented variant known as New Pedestrianism, which has its origins in a 1929 planned community in Radburn, New Jersey.Arth, Michael E. (2010). Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests Golden Apples Media, ISBN 978-0-912467-12-2. pp. 120-139, 363-386
The organizing body for New Urbanism is the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the Charter of the New Urbanism, which says:
New Urbanists support regional planning for open space, context-appropriate architecture and planning, and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion, increase the supply of affordable housing, and rein in suburban sprawl. The Charter of the New Urbanism also covers issues such as historic preservation, safe streets, green building, and the re-development of brownfield land. The ten Principles of Intelligent Urbanism also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches.
Architecturally, new urbanist developments are often accompanied by New Classical, postmodern or vernacular styles, while that is not always the case.

[[Federal grants in the United States]]
CATEGORIES: Public finance, Federal assistance in the United States, Grants

In the United States, federal grants are economic aid issued by the United States government out of the general federal revenue.  A federal grant is an award of financial assistance from a federal agency to a recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States.
Grants are federal assistance or loans to individuals, benefits or entitlements. A grant is  not used to acquire property or services for the federal government's direct benefit.
Grants may also be issued by private non-profit organizations such as foundations, not-for-profit corporations or charitable trusts  which are all collectively referred to as charities.
Outside the United States grants, subventions or subsidies are used to in similar fashion by government or private charities to subsidize programs and projects that fit within the funding criteria of the grant-giving entity or donor.  Grants can be unrestricted, to be used by the recipient in any fashion within the perimeter of the recipient organization's activities or they may be restricted to a specific purpose by the benefactor.
Federal grants are defined and governed by the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, as incorporated in Title 31 Section 6304 of the U.S. Code.  A Federal grant is a:
 
 "...legal instrument reflecting the relationship between the United States Government and a State, a local government, or other entity when 1) the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value to the State or local government or other recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States instead of acquiring (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government; and 2) substantial involvement is not expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement."

When an awarding agency expects to be substantially involved in a project (beyond routine monitoring and technical assistance), the law requires use of a cooperative agreement instead.  When the government is procuring goods or services for its own direct benefit, and not for a broader public purpose, the law requires use of a federal contract.http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode31/usc_sec_31_00006305----000-.html

One of the earliest peoples to reside in Southeast Asia, the Mon were responsible for the spread of Theravada Buddhism in Burma and what is now Thailand. The Mon culture is credited as a major source of influence on the dominant Burmese culture.
As the eastern Mon were absorbed into the Thai society long ago, the western Mon of Burma have largely assimilated into Burmese society. In Burma, the Mon are fighting to preserve the Mon language and culture, and regain a greater degree of political autonomy. The Mon of Burma are divided into three sub-groups based on their ancestral region in Lower Burma: the Man Nya ([tpl]my|မန်ည[/tpl]) from Pathein (the Irrawaddy delta) in the west, the Man Duin ([tpl]my|မန်ဒိုၚ်[/tpl]): Bago in the central region, and the Man Da ([tpl]my|မန်ဒ[/tpl]): Mottama in the southeast.[tpl]sfn|Stewart|1937[/tpl] Once the predominant ethno-linguistic group in Lower Burma, speakers of the Mon language number fewer than one million today,[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] and those of Mon descent number anywhere between two million and eight million.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] The majority of Mon are monolingual in the Burmese language, and are counted as members of the majority Bamar (Burmans).

A stockbroker is a regulated professional individual, usually associated with a brokerage firm or broker-dealer, who buys and sells stocks and other securities for both retail and institutional clients, through a stock exchange or over the counter, in return for a fee or commission. Stockbrokers are known by numerous professional designations, depending on the license they hold, the type of securities they sell, or the services they provide. In the United States, a stockbroker must pass both the Series 7 and Series 63 and or Series 66 exams in order to be licensed. In most English speaking venues, the two word term stock broker, like stock brokerage, normally applies to the brokerage firm, rather than to the individual.

The film is about two e-mailing lovers who are completely unaware that their sweetheart is, in fact, a person with whom they share a  degree of animosity.

Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly — a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film.

[[Culture of Australia]]

CATEGORIES: Australian culture

The culture of Australia is essentially a Western culture influenced by the unique geography of the Australian continent, the diverse input of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the British colonisation of Australia that began in 1788, and the various waves of multi-ethnic migration that followed.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl][/ref] The predominance of the English language, the existence of a democratic system of government drawing upon the British traditions of Westminster Government, Parliamentarianism and constitutional monarchy, American constitutionalist and federalist traditions, Christianity as the dominant religion, and the popularity of sports such as cricket and rugby are all evidence of a significant Anglo-Celtic heritage.  Australian culture has diverged significantly since British settlement in 1788.
Aboriginal people are believed to have arrived as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of Aboriginal art in Australia dates back at least 30,000 years. Several states and territories had their origins as penal colonies, with the first British convicts arriving at Sydney Cove in 1788. Stories of outlaws like the bushranger Ned Kelly have endured in Australian music, cinema and literature. The Australian gold rushes from the 1850s brought wealth as well as new social tensions to Australia, including the miners' Eureka Stockade rebellion. The colonies established elected parliaments and rights for workers and women before most other Western nations.Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books; 2004; ISBN 978-0-14-300559-9 Federation in 1901 evidenced a growing sense of national identity that had developed over the latter half of the 19th century, as seen in the works of the Heidelberg School painters and writers like Banjo Paterson, Henry Lawson and Dorothea Mackellar. The World Wars profoundly altered Australia's sense of identity, with World War I introducing the ANZAC legend, and World War II seeing a reorientation from Britain to the United States as the nation's foremost major ally.  After the second war, 6.5 million migrants from 200 nations brought immense new diversity, and Australians grew increasingly aware of their proximity to Asia. Over time, the diverse food, lifestyle and cultural practices of immigrants have been absorbed into mainstream Australian culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country |title=About Australia: Our Country |publisher= australia.gov.au |accessdate=2013-10-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/people_culture.html |title=About Australia: People, culture and lifestyle |publisher=Dfat.gov.au |accessdate=2013-10-25[/tpl]
Egalitarianism, informality and an irreverent sense of humour have been common themes of cultural commentary, exemplified by the works of C. J. Dennis, Barry Humphries and Paul Hogan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/people_culture.html |title=About Australia: People, culture and lifestyle |publisher=Dfat.gov.au |accessdate=2011-01-29[/tpl] Fascination with the outback has persisted in the arts in Australia and agriculture has been an important economic sector, despite the nation becoming increasingly urbanised during the 20th century. Two-thirds of the population reside in the state capital cities along the coast.
The major cities host such internationally renowned cultural institutions as the Sydney Opera House and National Gallery of Victoria, and Australia has contributed many artists to music and film internationally, from hard rock's AC/DC to opera's Joan Sutherland, to Hollywood actors Geoffrey Rush and Nicole Kidman. Australians also participate in a wide variety of sports, including Australian rules football and a vibrant surf culture.

Stanley Augustus Holloway, OBE (1 October 1890 – 30 January 1982) was an English stage and film actor, comedian, singer, poet and monologist. He was famous for his comic and character roles on stage and screen, especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady. He was also renowned for his comic monologues and songs which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.
Born in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in Kissing Time when the musical transferred to the West End from Broadway.  In 1921, he joined a concert party, The Co-Optimists, and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised.  Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by Marriott Edgar, were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in variety, pantomime and musical comedy, including several revues.
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the British Film Institute and Pathé News and took character parts in a series of war films including Major Barbara, The Way Ahead, This Happy Breed and The Way to the Stars. After the war, he appeared in the film Brief Encounter and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including Passport to Pimlico, The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt.
In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady, a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the film version in 1964. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor Julian Holloway.

The Kansas River (also known as the Kaw) (Lenape: Kansiai Sipu ) is a river in northeastern Kansas in the United States. It is the southwestern-most part of the Missouri River drainage, which is in turn the northwestern-most portion of the extensive Mississippi River drainage. Its name (and nickname) come from the Kanza (Kaw) people who once inhabited the area. The state of Kansas in turn drew its name from the river.[tpl]cite web |title = Kansas history page |url =http://www.netstate.com/states/intro/ks_intro.htm |accessdate = 2006-11-28[/tpl]The Encyclopedia of Kansas (1994) ISBN 403-09921-8
The river valley averages [tpl]convert|2.6|mi[/tpl] in width, with the widest points being between Wamego and Rossville, where it is up to [tpl]convert|4|mi[/tpl] wide, then narrowing to [tpl]convert|1|mi[/tpl] or less in places below Eudora. Much of the river's watershed is dammed for flood control, but the Kansas River is generally free-flowing and has only minor obstructions, including diversion weirs and one low impact hydroelectric dam.

CATEGORIES: Czech musical instruments, Early musical instruments, French musical instruments, Galician musical instruments, Hungarian musical instruments, Hurdy-gurdies, Hurdy-gurdy players, Portuguese musical instruments, Swiss musical instruments, Ukrainian musical instruments

The hurdy gurdy or hurdy-gurdy is a stringed instrument that produces sound by a crank-turned, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. The wheel functions much like a violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to those of a violin. Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangents — small wedges, typically made of wood — against one or more of the strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a sound board to make the vibration of the strings audible.
Most hurdy gurdies have multiple drone strings, which give a constant pitch accompaniment to the melody, resulting in a sound similar to that of bagpipes. For this reason, the hurdy gurdy is often used interchangeably or along with bagpipes, particularly in French and contemporary Hungarian and Galician folk music.
Many folk music festivals in Europe feature music groups with hurdy gurdy players. The most famous annual festival has been held since 1976 at Saint-Chartier in the Indre département in Central France. In 2009, it re-located nearby to the Château d'Ars at La Châtre, where it continues to take place during the week nearest July 14 (Bastille Day).

Hattie Jacques ([tpl]IPAc-en|dʒ|eɪ|k|s[/tpl]; born Josephine Edwina Jaques; 7 February 1922 – 6 October 1980) was an English comedy actress of stage, radio and screen. She is best known as a regular of the Carry On films, where she typically played strict, no-nonsense characters, but was also a prolific television and radio performer.
Jacques started her career in 1944 with an appearance at the Players' Theatre in London, but came to national prominence through her appearances on three highly popular radio series on the BBC: with Tommy Handley on It's That Man Again; with ventriloquist Peter Brough on Educating Archie; and then with Tony Hancock on Hancock's Half Hour. After the Second World War Jacques made her cinematic debut in Green for Danger, in which she had a brief, uncredited role. From 1958 to 1974 she appeared in 14 Carry On films, playing various roles including the formidable hospital matron. On television she had a long professional partnership with Eric Sykes, with whom she co-starred in his long-running series Sykes and Sykes and a....  The role endeared her to the public and the two became staples of British television.
In private, Jacques led a turbulent life. She was married to the actor John Le Mesurier from 1949 until their divorce in 1965,Complete A-Z of Dad's Army (Webber, Ed)London, Orion 2000 ISBN 0-7528-1838-4 a separation caused by her five-year affair with another man. Jacques, who had been overweight since her teenage years, suffered ill-health soon after the separation from Le Mesurier and her weight rose to nearly 20 stone (130 kg). She died of a heart attack on 6 October 1980, at the age of 58. Her biographer, Francis Gray, considers Jacques had a "talent for larger-than-life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity", while she could also display "a broader comic mode" as a result of her "extraordinary versatility".[tpl]sfn|Gray|2004[/tpl]

[[The Patterns of Chaos]]

CATEGORIES: 1972 novels, 1970s science fiction novels, British science fiction novels, Space opera novels, Works originally published in If (magazine), Novels first published in serial form

The Patterns of Chaos is a 1972 science fiction novel by Colin Kapp. It originally appeared in If magazine, serialized in three parts.
It combines grand space operatic themes of battle between space empires and intergalactic alien invasion with philosophical themes of predestination and destiny, and detailed character development of a tight set of central characters.
Earth's Stellar Commando has placed their secret agent Commander Bron on a planet where they hope he will be able to find out the coordinates of a rival space empire, the Destroyers.
Bron is there to impersonate a famous scientist of interest to the Destroyers, and has been given implants through which a monitoring team can see what he sees, hear what he hears and talk to him, even when separated by interstellar distances.  The plot hinges on a fictional science, the study of the entropic patterns of Chaos, which allows predictions of events with an accuracy that was not before possible. Both Earth and the Destroyers—and specifically Bron himself—are discovered to be the target of an extraterrestrial interstellar murder campaign that was hatched 700 million years ago. He succeeds in joining together the Earth and Destroyer fleets and confronts the aliens, to discover that his destiny is inextricably entangled with theirs.

[[Cover version]]
CATEGORIES: Album types, Arrangement, Music industry, Popular music, Song forms

In popular music, a cover version or cover song, or simply cover, is a new performance or recording of a previously recorded, commercially released (or unreleased) song,  by someone other than the original artist or composer.
Originally, Billboard and other magazines that track the popularity of musical artists and hit tunes measured the sales success of the published tune, not just recordings of it. Later, they tracked the airplay that songs achieved, some cover versions being more successful recording(s) than the original song(s).http://museum.woolworths.co.uk/1950s-embassyrecords.htm [tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] Cover versions of well-known, well-liked tunes are often recorded by new artists to achieve initial success when their unfamiliar original material would be less likely to be successful. Before the onset of Rock 'n' Roll in the 1950s, songs were published and several records of a song might be brought out by singers of the day, each giving it their individual treatment.
On occasion a cover becomes more popular and well known than the original, such as Santana's version in 1970 of Peter Green's and Fleetwood Mac's 1968 song "Black Magic Woman" or Jimi Hendrix's version of Bob Dylan's "All Along the Watchtower."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/song/t1991287 | title = All Along the Watchtower | accessdate = 2011-01-14 | last = Bush | first = John | publisher = AllMusic[/tpl] The Hendrix version, released six months after Dylan's original, became a Top 10 single in the UK in 1968 (#20 US) and was ranked 48th in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Labradorite ((Ca, Na)(Al, Si)4O8), a feldspar mineral, is an intermediate to calcic member of the plagioclase series. It is usually defined as having "%An" (anorthite) between 50 and 70.  The specific gravity ranges from 2.68 to 2.72. The streak is white, like most silicates. The refractive index ranges from 1.559 to 1.573. Twinning is common. As with all plagioclase members the crystal system is triclinic and three directions of cleavage are present two of which form nearly right angle prisms. It occurs as clear, white to gray, blocky to lath shaped grains in common mafic igneous rocks such as basalt and gabbro, as well as in anorthosites.

</ref>
Initially, Wahhabism was a revivalist movement instigated by an eighteenth century theologian, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703–1792) from Najd, Saudi Arabia.[ref]
</ref> He eventually convinced the local [[Amir]], Uthman ibn Mu'ammar, to help him in his struggle.<ref>

[/ref] The movement gained unchallenged precedence in most of the Arabian Peninsula through an alliance between Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and the House of Muhammad ibn Saud, which provided political and financial power for the religious revival represented by Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. The alliance created the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where Mohammed bin Abd Al-Wahhab's teachings are state-sponsored and the dominant form of Islam.[ref]
</ref>
The movement claims to adhere to the correct understanding of the general Islamic doctrine of Tawhid, on the "uniqueness" and "unity" of God, shared by the majority of Islamic sects, but with an emphasis on advocating following of the Athari school of thought only.[tpl]harvnb|Esposito|2003|p=333[/tpl][tpl]failed verification|date=April 2014[/tpl] Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab was influenced by the writings of Ibn Taymiyya and questioned the prevalent philosophical interpretations of Islam being the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools, claiming to rely on the Qur'an and the Hadith without speculative philosophy so as to not transgress beyond the limits of the early Muslims known as the Salaf.[tpl]failed verification|date=April 2014[/tpl] He attacked a "perceived moral decline and political weakness" in the Arabian Peninsula and condemned what he perceived as idolatry, the popular cult of saints, and shrine and tomb visitation, advocating a purging of the widespread practices by Muslims that he considered impurities and innovations in Islam.
The terms Wahhabi and Salafi and ahl al-hadith (people of hadith) are often used interchangeably,[tpl]cite web|title=Wahabi & Salafi|url=http://www.alahazrat.net/islam/wahabi-salafi.php|publisher=alahazrat.net|accessdate=2014-03-22|quote=Throughout history there have been different names for this Sect, but in the eighth century, one of their leaders use to call himself Salafi.

[[Geothermal desalination]]
CATEGORIES: Geothermal energy, Water desalination

Geothermal desalination is a process under development for the production of fresh water using heat energy.  Claimed benefits of this method of desalination are that it requires less maintenance than reverse osmosis membranes and that the primary energy input is from geothermal heat, which is a low-environmental-impact source of energy. 
Around 1995, entrepreneur Douglas Firestone from Nevada came up with an idea to use geothermal water directly as a source for desalination. In 1998, several individuals began working with evaporation/condensation air loop water desalination. The experiment was successful and a proof of concept, proving that geothermal waters could be used as process water to produce potable water in 2001. 
In 2005 to 2009 some testing was done in a sixth prototype of a device referred to as a delta t device, a closed air loop, atmospheric pressure, evaporation condensation loop geothermally powered desalination device. The device used filtered sea water from Scripps Institute of Oceanography and reduced the salt concentration from 35,000 ppm to 51 ppm. 
A total of six prototypes and six modifications demonstrated that, with process water approaching [tpl]convert|100|°C[/tpl] and a chill source about [tpl]convert|2|°C[/tpl], a full-size device would produce about 600 m³ of water per day. Salt concentration in the wastewater would only be about 10% above the level of the original water, thus, from, say, 35,000 to about 38,000 parts per million, well within the ability of osmoregulators to adjust.

[[Crumhorn]]

CATEGORIES: Early musical instruments, Woodwind instruments

The  crumhorn is a musical instrument of the woodwind family, most commonly used during the Renaissance period.  In modern times, there has been a revival of interest in Early Music, and crumhorns are being played again.
The name derives from the German Krumhorn (or Krummhorn or Krumporn) meaning bent horn. This relates to the old English crump meaning curve, surviving in modern English in 'crumpled' and 'crumpet' (a curved cake).  The similar sounding French term cromorne when used correctly refers to a woodwind instrument of different design, though the term cromorne is often used in error synonymously with that of crumhorn.
The crumhorn is a capped reed instrument. Its construction is similar to that of the chanter of a bagpipe. A double reed is mounted inside a long windcap. Blowing through a slot in the windcap produces a musical note. The pitch of the note can be varied by opening or closing finger holes along the length of the pipe. One unusual feature of the crumhorn is its shape; the end is bent upwards in a curve resembling the letter 'J'. Some people think[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=January 2013[/tpl] this is so that the sound produced from the crumhorn is directed toward the player to improve the intonation in consort playing.
Crumhorns make a strong buzzing sound, but quieter than their conical-bore relatives the rauschpfeife and shawm.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] They have a limited range, usually a ninth. While it is theoretically possible to get the reed to overblow a twelfth above the fundamental note, this is extremely difficult because the reed is not held in the mouth (and even if done would result in a gap of two notes in the scale on historical instruments), and in practice all playing is confined to the fundamental series. Some larger instruments have their range extended downwards by means of additional holes, keys and sliders, and the pitch of the instrument can be lowered a perfect fifth by dropping the breath pressure (called "underblowing"). Some modern instruments have their range extended upwards to an eleventh by two keys. Crumhorns can be chromatically played by using cross-fingerings, except for the minor second above the lowest note.
Because of the limited range, music for crumhorns is usually played by a group of instruments of different sizes and hence at different pitches.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] Such a group is known as a consort of crumhorns. Crumhorns are built in imitation of the vocal quartet with soprano, alto, tenor and bass as a family, as was true of most instruments of the Renaissance. There are examples of higher and lower sounding instruments, of which the great bass is the only commonly used one. Modern instruments are pitched in C and F (Renaissance altos were usually pitched in g, continuing the distance of a fifth between sizes):
There are some pieces specifying crumhorns in two manuscript sets of partbooks prepared for the Prussian court band, including an anonymous setting of "D’Andernach auff dem Reine". Johann Hermann Schein included a Padouana für 4 Krummhörner for crumhorns in his collection Banchetto Musicale (1617), and Thomas Stoltzer wrote in a letter that he had composed his setting of Psalm 37, '"Erzürne dich nicht" (1526), such that the lower six of the seven parts could be played on crumhorns.Boydell 2001. Michael Praetorius suggested the use of crumhorns in some of his sacred vocal works as a possible alternative to trombones, dulcians and other instruments.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
In Ursula Dubosarsky's novel Bruno and the Crumhorn, two children, Bruno and Sybil, find themselves learning to play the crumhorn almost by accident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.recorderhomepage.net/crumhorn.html |title=Crumhorn Home Page |publisher=Recorderhomepage.net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03[/tpl]

A mechanical or physical shock is a sudden acceleration or deceleration caused, for example, by impact, drop, kick, earthquake, or explosion.  Shock is a transient physical excitation.
Shock is term for extreme forces subject to matter, often quantified by acceleration per unit time. needed. A shock interaction can be characterised by the peak acceleration, the duration, and the shape of the shock pulse (half sine, triangular, trapezoidal, etc.).  The Shock response spectrum is a method for further evaluating a mechanical shock.  It is sometimes used as a defense standard for military equipment.
Shock is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction.

The Ford Taurus is an automobile manufactured by the Ford Motor Company in the United States. Originally introduced in the 1986 model year, it has remained in near-continuous production for more than two decades, making it the fourth-oldest nameplate that is currently sold in the North American Ford lineup.The only vehicles in Ford's current North American product line that have been in production longer than the Taurus are the Ford Ranger, Ford Mustang, and Ford F-150. It has had a more-upscale Mercury-branded version entitled the Sable (1986–2005; 2008–2009), as well as a performance variant, the Ford Taurus SHO (1989–1999 and 2010–); in addition, it served as the basis for the first-ever front-wheel drive Lincoln Continental (1988–1994). It was a front-wheel drive mid-size car until 2007, and has been a full-size car since 2008, and available in front- or all-wheel drive since 2008. It has been built on the D3 platform since 2008.
The original Taurus was a milestone design for Ford and the entire American automotive industry, as well as a very influential vehicle that brought many new features and innovations to the marketplace. Since its launch in 1986, Ford had built 7,519,919 Tauruses through the 2007 model year,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/Specs/Production.php |title=Production Figures |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |accessdate=2009-09-25[/tpl] making it the fifth-best-selling North American nameplate in Ford's history; only the F-150,[tpl]cite web | last = O'Neil | first = Mike| date = | url = http://www.ford-trucks.com/news/idx/12/247/2005/article/01122005 "Ford's F-Series sets industry truck sales records | title = Ford's F-series sets industry sales truck records| publisher = Ford Trucks.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] Escort,[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | date = 2000-07-21 | url = http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5429 | title = Farewell, Ford Escort | publisher = Media.Ford.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] Model T,[tpl]cite web | last = O'Neill | first = Mike | date = 2004-05-05 | url = http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=17697 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015154444/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=17697 | archivedate = 2007-10-15 | title = Ford Nameplates join Five Million Club | publisher = Media.Ford.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] and Mustang have sold more units.

[[II & III]]

CATEGORIES: Camper Van Beethoven albums, Pitch-A-Tent albums, 1986 albums

II & III is a 1986 album by musical group Camper Van Beethoven, released on Pitch-a-Tent and Rough Trade.  It was the band's second album.
After releasing their debut album, original drummer Anthony Guess left the band, and guitarist Greg Lisher joined.  With the band temporarily lacking a drummer, guitarist Chris Molla played many of the drum parts on 'II & III', with singer/rhythm guitarist David Lowery playing some of the drum parts as well.  As the album was being finished, they finally found a permanent replacement for Guess with Chris Pedersen, who ended up playing on only one song, "We're a Bad Trip."
The album also found violinist/multi-instrumentalist Jonathan Segel singing lead vocals for the first time, on the tracks "Chain of Circumstance" and "We're a Bad Trip," the latter which featured him and Lowery trading verses.
II & III found the band already moving past the mixture of faux ethnic instrumentals and absurdist folk-pop-punk tunes of their debut album, for an even more eclectic sound, including elements of Americana, psychedelia, and Middle-Eastern music.  Molla played steel guitar on some songs, and Segel played mandolin, adding to the country influences.  There are relatively fewer instrumentals, with the vocal songs taking on many of the ethnic elements that were contained on the debut album's instrumental numbers.
It contains several notable songs, especially "Sad Lover's Waltz," a slow alt-country number that did much to dispel the band's then-image as a novelty band.  Another Americana-style song was a bluegrass-influenced cover of "I Love Her All the Time" by Sonic Youth, which continued the band's traditions of doing countrified versions of punk and alternative songs.

[[Shrewsbury, Louisiana]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana

Shrewsbury was an unincorporated town in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, along the Mississippi River and Shrewsbury Road about 1 mile upriver from the border of the city of New Orleans.  The name came into use in the mid-19th century, and became less commonly used towards the end of the 20th century, when surrounding communities of unincorporated Jefferson grew together as a suburb of New Orleans.  The area is now generally known as Old Jefferson and is part of the Greater New Orleans Metropolitan area.
During the early 20th century, Shrewsbury Road was an official link in the Jefferson Highway (State Route 1, and later U.S. Route 61) and provided the main automobile route into New Orleans via Metairie Road.  It faded in importance as new and more direct routes into the city were constructed, namely the extensions of Jefferson Highway (1928) and Airline Highway (1940) into South Claiborne Avenue and Tulane Avenue, respectively.  The final blow came in June 1957 when the railroad crossing on Shrewsbury Road was closed following completion of the nearby Causeway Boulevard overpass, leaving the once prominent road discontinuous.
In 1915, Shrewsbury was connected to New Orleans by two streetcar lines.  The first was the Orleans-Kenner interurban line (popularly known as the O-K Line), which provided service between Kenner and downtown New Orleans along the Jefferson Highway/Claiborne Avenue corridor.  The second was an extension of the Napoleon Avenue streetcar line completed in 1915 with service along Metairie Road to Shrewsbury Road.  The O-K Line was discontinued in 1930, and the Napoleon Avenue streetcar was cut back in 1934 replaced by the Metairie bus line.
In 1917, the Jefferson Park Race Track was opened near the intersection of Jefferson Highway and Shrewsbury Road and was a favorite horse racing venue for many years.  The site was converted into the Jefferson Park residential subdivision in 1948.
The area is also home to the Camp Parapet Powder Magazine, one of the last remnants of the American Civil War in the New Orleans area.
Shrewsbury, Louisiana is referred to in the Rhythm & Blues song Shrewsbury Blues, written by Dave Bartholomew and recorded by Tommy Ridgeley, a native of the area.

[[Camper Van Beethoven (album)]]
CATEGORIES: Camper Van Beethoven albums, Pitch-A-Tent albums, 1986 albums

Camper Van Beethoven is a 1986 (see 1986 in music) album by musical group Camper Van Beethoven, released on Pitch-A-Tent. With the six then CVB members joined in the studio by acid-folk eccentric Eugene Chadbourne, the album is arguably the zenith of the band's musical experimentation, with surreal lyrics, backwards, speeded-up and slowed down parts, and a great number of ethnic instruments used.  In addition to the usual violin parts played by member Jonathan Segel, the album also features pedal steel, banjo, tablas and sitar.
While the album features the band's trademark absurdist lyrics by leader David Lowery and Segel, with CVB staples like affectionate parodies of counterculture and references to drugs and alien abduction, it also features some satirical political lyrics and social commentary on tracks like "Good Guys and Bad Guys", "Joe Stalin's Cadillac" and "We Love You"'.
The songs cover a bewildering range of musical styles: garage punk on "Shut Us Down"', acid-rock jamming on the Pink Floyd cover "Interstellar Overdrive", bluegrass jamming on "Hoe Yourself Down", folk-ska on "Good Guys and Bad Guys", gentle tabla beats on "Une Fois" and "Folly", psychedelic pop on "We Saw Jerry's Daughter", ominous desert-rock spoken word on "Peace and Love" and grinding raga-rock on "Stairway to Heavan" (sic). While earlier CVB albums had featured influences of Eastern European and Mexican musical styles, this album has more noticeable elements of Indian and Arabic musics, done in the usual irreverent Camper style.  These combine with the elements of psychedelic music that dominate the album.  There are also more elements of Americana than on their previous albums. The American Southwest looms large in the music and lyrics as well, especially on songs like "The History of Utah" and "Peace and Love".
There are a number of classic rock references too:  "We Saw Jerry's Daughter" is a parody of Deadheads; "Stairway to Heavan" (sic), "Five Sticks" and "Joe Stalin's Cadillac" all contain song titles or lyrics modified from Led Zeppelin; and the cover of "Interstellar Overdrive" and several of the album's songs are reminiscent of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. "We Love You" also contains a parody of the Charlie Daniels Band song "The Devil Went Down to Georgia". In the original "The Devil Went Down to Georgia", the Devil was portrayed as a negative being who is defeated in a fiddle-playing contest by the song's protagonist, but in "We Love You", the devil, presumably Jonathan Segel, so impresses the band with his violin playing that they allow him to become a band member. The classic-rock influences are a contrast from their first two albums, which contained covers of other contemporary underground bands like Sonic Youth and Black Flag.
A number of the album's tracks remain staples of the reunited Camper Van Beethoven's live sets, including "Good Guys and Bad Guys", "The History of Utah", "Interstellar Overdrive" and "Shut Us Down".
In an Oct. 4, 2010, entry on Lowery's "300 Songs" blog, devoted to explaining the genesis and meaning behind the songs he has written throughout his career, the band's leader claimed that this album had a hidden title, concealed in the liner notes and etched onto initial vinyl pressings: "Soviet Spies Swim Upstream Disguised as Trout." Lowery wrote that this title was inspired by "an obsessive fan that would write us nearly everyday."Lowery, David. "#59 Stairway to Heavan (sic)- In Praise of Half Baked Ideas and Unfinished things. The importance of not being earnest.". 300songs.com, Retrieved on October 5, 2010.
The Ziggens' song "I Got Me a Girlfriend" is partially a cover of "Joe Stalin's Cadillac."

Nuclear terrorism denotes the detonation of a yield-producing nuclear bomb containing fissile material by terrorists.[tpl]cite web|title=Nuclear Security Dossier: Nuclear Terrorism Fact Sheet|url=http://www.nuclearsummit.org/nuclear_terrorism_101.html|work=Harvard Kennedy School, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs|accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl]  Some definitions of nuclear terrorism include the sabotage of a nuclear facility and/or the detonation of a radiological device, colloquially termed a dirty bomb, but consensus is lacking. In legal terms, nuclear terrorism is an offense committed if a person unlawfully and intentionally “uses in any way radioactive material … with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or with the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the environment; or with the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an international organization or a State to do or refrain from doing an act”, according to the 2005 United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-15.pdf|title=International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism - Article 1|year=2005|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=13 April 2012[/tpl]
The possibility of terrorist organizations using nuclear weapons (especially very small ones, such as suitcase nukes) has been a threat in American rhetoric and culture. It is considered plausible that terrorists could acquire a nuclear weapon.  In 2011, the British news agency, the Telegraph, received leaked documents regarding the Guantanamo Bay interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The documents cited Khalid saying that, if Osama bin Laden is captured or killed by the Coalition of the Willing, an al-Qaeda sleeper cell will detonate a "weapon of mass destruction" in a "secret location" in Europe, and promised it would be "a nuclear hellstorm".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8471907/WikiLeaks-Guantanamo-Bay-terrorist-secrets-revealed.html | title=WikiLeaks: Guantanamo Bay terrorist secrets revealed | publisher=Telegraph.co.uk | accessdate=April 27, 2011 | author=Hope, Christopher | location=London | date=April 25, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/WikiLeaks-GuantanamoBay-al-Qaida-terrorist/2011/04/25/id/393982 | title=WikiLeaks: Al-Qaida Already Has Nuclear Capacity | publisher=NewsMax | accessdate=April 27, 2011 | author=Gould, Martin[/tpl]

The Stamp Act 1765 (short title Duties in American Colonies Act 1765; 5 George III, c. 12) imposed a direct tax by the British Parliament specifically on the colonies of British America, and it required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp.Morgan and Morgan pg. 96–97"The Stamp Act of 1765 – A Serendipitous Find" by Hermann Ivester in The Revenue Journal, The Revenue Society, Vol.XX, No.3, December 2009, pp.87–89. These printed materials were legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies.  Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money.Wood, S,G. "The American Revolution: A History." Modern Library. 2002, page 24. The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years' War. The Americans said there was no military need for the soldiers because there were no foreign enemies and the Americans had always protected themselves against Native Americans, and suggested it was rather a matter of British patronage to surplus British officers and career soldiers who should be paid by London.
The Stamp Act was very unpopular among colonists. Many colonists considered it a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent—consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant. Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests.  The Stamp Act Congress held in New York City, reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure, also petitioned Parliament and the King. Local protest groups, led by colonial merchants and landowners, established connections through correspondence that created a loose coalition that extended from New England to Maryland.  Protests and demonstrations initiated by the Sons of Liberty often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved.  Very soon all stamp tax distributors were intimidated into resigning their commissions, and the tax was never effectively collected.Draper pg. 216–223. Nash pg. 44–56. Maier pg. 76–106
Opposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies. British merchants and manufacturers, whose exports to the colonies were threatened by colonial economic problems exacerbated by the tax, also pressured Parliament.  The Act was repealed on March 18, 1766 as a matter of expedience, but Parliament affirmed its power to legislate for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever” by also passing the Declaratory Act. There followed a series of new taxes and regulations, likewise opposed by the colonists.
The episode played a major role in defining the grievances and enabling the organized colonial resistance that led to the American Revolution in 1775.Middlekauff pg. 111–120.  Miller pg. 149–153[tpl]cite web | author = Daniella Garran | title =Steps to the American Revolution | publisher = Lesson Planet | date = 2010-07-19 | url = http://www.lessonplanet.com/article/history/steps-to-the-american-revolution | accessdate = 2010-07-21 [/tpl]

[[Tusk (album)]]
CATEGORIES: Fleetwood Mac albums, 1979 albums, Albums produced by Richard Dashut, Albums produced by Ken Caillat, Warner Bros. Records albums, Rhino Records albums

Tusk is the 12th album by the British/American rock band Fleetwood Mac. Released in 1979, it is considered experimental, primarily due to Lindsey Buckingham's sparser songwriting arrangements and the influence of punk rock and New Wave on his production techniques. Bassist John McVie has commented that the album sounds like "the work of three solo artists" (Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie), whilst Mick Fleetwood later proclaimed that it is his favourite and the best Fleetwood Mac studio album created by the group. Costing over one million dollars to record (a fact widely noted in the 1979 press), it was the most expensive rock album made up to that point.
Tusk peaked at #4 in the US, spent over five months within the top 40, and was certified double platinum for shipping two million copies.[tpl]Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|title=Tusk |artist=Fleetwood Mac|type=album[/tpl] It peaked at #1 in the UK and achieved a Platinum award for shipments in excess of 300,000 copies[tpl]Certification Cite Ref|region=United Kingdom|title=Tusk |artist=Fleetwood Mac|type=album[/tpl]. The album gave the group two US top-ten hit singles, with the Buckingham-penned title track (US #8/UK #6), and the Stevie Nicks composition "Sara" (US #7/UK #37). Further releases from the album, "Not That Funny" (UK only single release), "Think About Me" and "Sisters of the Moon" were less successful; however, the latter two appear in their 'single versions' on the 2002 compilation The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. "Sara" was cut to 4½ minutes for both the single and the first CD release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the 1988 Greatest Hits compilation and the 2004 reissue of Tusk as well as Fleetwood Mac's 2002 release of The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions for Tusk, but his playing on the Christine McVie track "Brown Eyes" is not credited on the album.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.org/peter-green.php|title=Fleetwood Mac/Peter Green|publisher=Fleetwood Mac|accessdate=Sep 9, 2011[/tpl] However, on the alternate version (which is about 30 seconds longer) that was released on 25 Years – The Chain, Green's distinctive guitar playing can be recognized, especially at the very end of the song.
Though the album sold four million copies worldwide, in comparison to the huge sales of Rumours and the unprecedented recording expense, the band's record label deemed the project a failure, laying the blame squarely with Buckingham himself.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] Fleetwood, however, blames the album's relative failure on the RKO radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home taping.[tpl]cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac|last=Fleetwood|first=Mick|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=219[/tpl] In addition, Tusk was a double album, with a high list price of $15.98 (49.43 in 2011 dollars).
The band embarked on a huge 18-month tour to promote Tusk. They travelled extensively across the world, including the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany they shared the bill with reggae superstar Bob Marley. It was on this world tour that the band recorded music for the Fleetwood Mac Live album, which was released at the end of 1980.

Tourism forms an important part of Austria's economy, accounting for almost 9% of the Austrian gross domestic product.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/tourismus_in_oesterreich_2007_bmwa_wko_stat_031155.pdf |title=TOURISMUS IN ÖSTERREICH 2007|accessdate=2008-11-18 |language= German|date= May 2008|format=PDF|publisher= BMWA, WKO, Statistik Austria[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
As of 2007, the total number of tourist overnight stays is roughly the same for summer and winter season, with peaks in February and July/August.
In 2007, Austria ranked 9th worldwide in international tourism receipts, with 18.9 billion US$. In international tourist arrivals, Austria ranked 12th with 20.8 million tourists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tourismroi.com/Content_Attachments/27670/File_633513750035785076.pdf |title=UNTWO World Tourism Barometer, Vol.6 No.2 |accessdate=2008-11-18 |publisher=UNTWO |date=June 2008 |format=PDF [/tpl]
Vienna attracts a major part of tourists, both in summer and winter. Salzburg receives about a fifth of tourist overnight stays compared to Vienna, which ranks it 2nd in the summer season. In the winter season, a number of winter sport resorts in western Austria overtake Salzburg in the number of tourist overnight stays: Sölden, Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Ischgl, Sankt Anton am Arlberg, and Obertauern.
Visits to Austria mostly include trips to Vienna with its Cathedral, its "Heurigen" (wine pubs) and romantic Waltz music events. Worth a visit are Salzburg, birthplace of Mozart, Innsbruck, capital of Tyrol surrounded by the Alps, and the Danube valley with its vineyards, for example the Wachau or Dunkelsteinerwald, which are between Melk and Krems. In the western part of the country the province Vorarlberg reaches the Lake Constance, in the eastern part Neusiedler See. The three most visited landmarks in Austria are Schönbrunn Palace (2,590,000 visitors per year), Tiergarten Schönbrunn (2,453,987 visitors) and Mariazell Basilica (1,500,000 visitors).Die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten in Österreich 
Of great touristic importance are the Austrian skiing, hiking and mountaineering resorts in the Alps as well as family-friendly recreation areas (e.g. the Witches's Water in Tyrol). The same applies to the numerous Austrian lakes (e.g. Wolfgangsee and other lakes in the Salzkammergut east of Salzburg or Wörthersee in Carinthia).
For visitors interested in Media Art, there is the Ars Electronica Center in Linz. Since 1979 this center has organized the Ars Electronica Festival and presented the Prix Ars Electronica, the worldwide highest-ranked prize for media art.

When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative path (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from a root directory), the reference is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the process.  So for example a process with working directory /rabbit-hats that asks to create the file foo.txt will end up creating the file /rabbit-hats/foo.txt.

Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. is the first official release by American metal band Slipknot. Released originally on October 31, 1996, it was limited to production of 1,000 copies. The band originally self-distributed some of these copies, but went on to release the remaining units through -ismist Recordings in 1997. Due to its limited release, the album has become much sought by fans since Slipknot's rise in fame.
Despite considering it their first album upon release, the band now considers Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. to be a demo and have evolved and released the majority of the songs on future releases, albeit usually in radically altered forms. It was recorded in Des Moines, Iowa, over a period of four months. The music of the album contains many influences including funk, jazz, and disco which weren't as apparent in later material. Many of the lyrics and the album's title are derived from the role playing game Werewolf: The Apocalypse. The songs contain an "emphasis on non-traditional songwriting" and melodic themes more than subsequent releases.[tpl]cite web |url= http://allmusic.com/album/mate-feed-kill-repeat-r524656|title= Mate.

Iowa is the second album by American metal band Slipknot. Released by Roadrunner Records on August 28, 2001, it was produced by Ross Robinson and Slipknot. The title derives from the band's home state, Iowa, which members have stated is one of their biggest sources of inspiration. With much anticipation for the band's second album following on the success of their 1999 self-titled debut, pressures on the band were high. Their relationships with each other suffered and was later described as the darkest time of their career.[tpl]cite news |title = Slipknot 10 years after... |work=Rocksound |pages=60–65 |date = May 2009[/tpl] It was also the first time that guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved in a Slipknot album due to his joining very late in recording of their debut album, as Root was only featured on two songs from that release. Despite troubles within the band and with Iowa's development, Slipknot promoted it for almost a year.
Iowa was a major success, premiering in the top ten album sales charts in nine countries. Generally positively received, it includes some of their notable songs, such as "Disasterpiece", "The Heretic Anthem", "People = Shit" and the two Grammy-nominated songs "Left Behind" and the remix of "My Plague". Critic John Mulvey proclaimed the album as the "absolute triumph of nu metal".[tpl]cite web| last = Mulvey| first = John| title = Slipknot – Iowa | publisher=Yahoo Music| date = August 23, 2001| url = http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/l_reviews_a/21574.html| accessdate = March 21, 2008[/tpl] While more technical than their debut album, Iowa is considered to be the band's heaviest and darkest. It has been certified platinum in the United States and Canada. A special edition of Iowa was reissued on November 1, 2011 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the record. It was accompanied by a full live audio of the hit DVD Disasterpieces and a film entitled Goat directed by Shawn Crahan with the four music videos, never-seen-before interviews and footage from the Iowa period.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Slipknots-Iowa-To-Be-Reissued-November-1-23470.aspx?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=FB%2B(Slipknot%2BReissue)&utm_campaign=FB%2B(Slipknot%2BReissue)|title = Slipknot's Iowa To Be Reissued November 1|publisher=Roadrunner|date = September 28, 2011|accessdate = September 28, 2011[/tpl]

Slipknot is the debut studio album by American metal band Slipknot. It was released on 29 June 1999 through Roadrunner Records, following a demo containing a few of the songs which had been released in 1998, and was reissued in December 1999 with a slightly altered track listing and mastering as the result of a lawsuit. It was the first release by the band to be produced by Ross Robinson, who sought to refine Slipknot's sound rather than alter the group's musical direction.
The album spans several genres, but is generally noted for its extensive percussion and overall heavy sound. It was well received by fans and critics alike and was responsible for bringing Slipknot a large increase in popularity. The album peaked at number 51 on the Billboard 200, and has gone on to become certified double platinum in the United States, making it the band's best selling album. It was voted the best debut album of the last 25 years by readers of Metal Hammer magazine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Slipknot-Voted-Best-Debut-Album-Of-The-Last-25-Years-23605.aspx |title=Slipknot Voted Best Debut Album of the Last 25 Years!

BledaPriscus: Βλήδας; Procopius: Βλέδας or Buda (c. 390 – 445) was a Hunnic ruler, the brother of Attila the Hun.
As nephews to Rugila, Attila and his elder brother Bleda succeeded him to the throne. Bleda's reign lasted for eleven years until his death. While it has been speculated[tpl]By whom|date=January 2010[/tpl] throughout history that Attila murdered him on a hunting trip, it is unknown exactly how he died. However there is an alternative theory that Bleda attempted to kill Attila on a hunting trip, but Attila being a skilled warrior defeated Bleda. One of the few things known about Bleda is that, after the great Hun campaign of 441, he acquired a Moorish dwarf named Zerco.  Bleda was highly amused by Zerco and went so far as to make a suit of armor for the dwarf so that Zerco could accompany him on campaign.

Edgar Cayce ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|iː[/tpl]; March 18, 1877 – January 3, 1945) was an American psychic who allegedly possessed the ability to answer questions on subjects as varied as healing, reincarnation, wars, Atlantis and future events while in a trance. These answers came to be known as "life readings of the entity" and were usually delivered to individuals while Cayce was hypnotized. This ability gave him the nickname "The Sleeping Prophet".

He is credited as being the father of holistic medicine and the most documented psychic of the 20th century. Hundreds of books have been written about him and his life readings for individuals. Though Cayce himself was a member of the Disciples of Christ and lived before the emergence of the New Age Movement, some consider him the true founder and a principal source of its most characteristic beliefs.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Emerging Network: A Sociology of the New Age and Neo-Pagan Movements |first=Michael |last=York |year=1995 |page=60 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=0-8476-8001-0[/tpl]

The Munich Agreement was a settlement permitting Nazi Germany's annexation of portions of Czechoslovakia along the country's borders mainly inhabited by German speakers, for which a new territorial designation "Sudetenland" was coined. The agreement was negotiated at a conference held in Munich, Germany, among the major powers of Europe, without the presence of Czechoslovakia. Today, it is widely regarded as a failed act of appeasement toward Germany. The agreement was signed in the early hours of 30 September 1938 (but dated 29 September). The purpose of the conference was to discuss the future of the Sudetenland in the face of ethnic demands made by Adolf Hitler. The agreement was signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Sudetenland was of immense strategic importance to Czechoslovakia, as most of its border defenses were situated there, and many of its banks and heavy industries were located there as well.
Because the state of Czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference, it considered itself to have been betrayed by the United Kingdom and France, so Czechs and Slovaks call the Munich Agreement the Munich Dictat ([tpl]lang-cs|Mnichovský diktát[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-sk|Mníchovský diktát[/tpl]). The phrase "Munich Betrayal" ([tpl]lang-cs|Mnichovská zrada[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-sk|Mníchovská zrada[/tpl]) is also used because the military alliance Czechoslovakia had with France and Britain proved useless. Today the document is typically referred to simply as the Munich Pact (Mnichovská dohoda).

Sejong the Great  (May 15, 1397 – April 8, 1450, r. 1418–1450) was the fourth king of  Joseon. Born with family name Yi ([tpl]lang|ko|이[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|李[/tpl]), given name Do ([tpl]lang|ko|도[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|祹[/tpl]), family origin Jeonju ([tpl]lang|ko|전주[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|全州[/tpl]), sobriquet Wonjung ([tpl]lang|ko|원정[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|元正[/tpl]). Posthumous name is Sejong ([tpl]lang|ko|세종[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|世宗[/tpl]). Posthumous title, abbreviated, is JangHun Great King ([tpl]lang|ko|장헌대왕[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|莊憲大王[/tpl]),transliteration or King ... the Great and official title is Sejong Jangheon Yeongmun Yemu Inseong Myeonghyo Daewang ([tpl]lang|ko|세종 장헌 영문 예무 인성 명효 대왕[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|世宗 莊憲 英文 睿武 仁聖 明孝 大王[/tpl]).ibid He was the third son between King Taejong and Queen-Consort Min. He was designated as heir-apparent, Grand Prince, after his older brother Jae was stripped of his title. He ascended to the throne in 1418. During the first four years of his reign, Taejong governed as regent, and this was when his father-in-law, Shim Ohn, and his close associates were executed.
Sejong reinforced Confucian policies and executed major legal amendments ([tpl]lang|ko|공법[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|貢法[/tpl]). He also oversaw the creation of Hangul, encouraged advancements of scientific technology, and instituted many other efforts to stabilize and improve prosperity. He dispatched military campaigns to the north and installed Samin Policy ([tpl]lang|ko|사민정책[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|ko|徙民政策[/tpl]) to attract new settlers to the region. To the south, he subjugated Japanese raiders and captured Tsushima Island.
During his reign from 1418 to 1450, he governed from 1418 to 1442 and governed as regent with his son Grand Prince MoonJong until his death in either 1442 or 1450.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

Conduct disorder (CD) is a psychological disorder diagnosed in childhood or adolescence that presents itself through a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate norms are violated.  These behaviors are often referred to as "antisocial behaviors."Hinshaw, S. P., & Lee, S. S. (2003).  Conduct and oppositional defiant disorders. In E. J. Mash  &  R. A. Barkley (Eds.), Child psychopathology (pp. 144-198).  New York: Guilford Press. Indeed, the disorder is often seen as the precursor to antisocial personality disorder, which is not diagnosed until the individual is 18 years old.

[[Analytic philosophy]]
CATEGORIES: Analytic philosophy, Philosophical movements, Philosophical traditions, Contemporary philosophy, 20th-century philosophy

Analytic philosophy (sometimes analytical philosophy) is a style of philosophy that came to dominate English-speaking countries in the 20th century. In the United Kingdom, United States,  Canada, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand, the vast majority of university philosophy departments identify themselves as "analytic" departments.[ref]
"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy."
John Searle (2003) Contemporary Philosophy in the United States in N. Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy, 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.[/ref]
The term "analytic philosophy" can refer to:
Quote on the definition: "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities."[/ref][tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1467-9973.2004.00329.x[/tpl]Colin McGinn, The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey through Twentieth-Century Philosophy (HarperCollins, 2002), p. xi.: "analytical philosophy is too narrow a label, since it is not generally a matter of taking a word or concept and analyzing it (whatever exactly that might be).  ...  This tradition emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory, truth. It is not a tradition that aims primarily for inspiration or consolation or ideology. Nor is it particularly concerned with 'philosophy of life,' though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science than religion, more like mathematics than poetry – though it is neither science nor mathematics."
In this latter, narrower sense, analytic philosophy is identified with specific philosophical commitments (many of which are rejected by contemporary analytic philosophers), such as:
According to a characteristic paragraph by Bertrand Russell:
 
 "Modern analytical empiricism ... differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite answers, which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy. It has the advantage, in comparison with the philosophies of the system-builders, of being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to invent at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, resemble those of science. I have no doubt that, in so far as philosophical knowledge is possible, it is by such methods that it must be sought; I have also no doubt that, by these methods, many ancient problems are completely soluble."A History of Western Philosophy (Simon & Schuster, 1945), p. 834.

Analytic philosophy is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably continental philosophy, and also Indian philosophy, Thomism, and Marxism.A.C. Grayling (ed.), Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 2: "Analytic philosophy is mainly associated with the contemporary English-speaking world, but it is by no means the only important philosophical tradition.  In this volume two other immensely rich and important such traditions are introduced: Indian philosophy, and philosophical thought in Europe from the time of Hegel."  L.J. Cohen, The Dialogue of Reason: An Analysis of Analytical Philosophy (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 5: "So, despite a few overlaps, analytical philosophy is not difficult to distinguish broadly ... from other modern movements, like phenomenology, say, or existentialism, or from the large amount of philosophizing that has also gone on in the present century within frameworks deriving from other influential thinkers like Aquinas, Hegel, or Marx."  H.-J. Glock, What Is Analytic Philosophy? (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 86: "Most non-analytic philosophers of the twentieth century do not belong to continental philosophy."

Bethnal Green tube station is a station on the Central Line of the London Underground in Bethnal Green, East London. It lies between Liverpool Street and Mile End stations, and in Travelcard Zone 2. The station was opened as part of the long planned Central Line eastern extension on 4 December 1946; before that it was used as an air-raid shelter. On 3 March 1943, 173 people were killed in a crush while attempting to enter the shelter.
The station is an example of the "New Works Programme 1935 - 1940" style adopted by London Transport for its new tube stations. Extensive use is made of pale yellow tiling, originally manufactured by Poole Pottery. This has been replicated during the 2007 modernisation although several panels of original tiling were retained on the platforms. The finishes include relief tiles, showing symbols of London and the area served by the London Passenger Transport Board, designed by Harold Stabler. The station entrances, all in the form of subway access staircases to the subterranean ticket hall, all show the design influences of Charles Holden, the consulting architect for London Transport at this time.

[[Broadband open access]]

CATEGORIES: Broadband

Broadband open access is an issue of policy debate in telecommunications, regarding whether or not companies which own broadband telecommunication infrastructure (such as cable operators) should be required to provide access to their facilities for competing businesses which do not own physical infrastructure. The issue came to the fore in the U.S. in 1998, when AT&T Corporation announced its plan to acquire TCI, then the nation's largest cable operator. It involved municipal and local governments, the courts, Federal Communications Commission (the FCC), Congress, businesses, industry associations, consumer advocacy groups, and many others. Similar issues arose in other countries such as the Netherlands, Hungary, and Canada.
In the United States, cable operators were not required to provide access to their facilities to other competing businesses. However, local telephone providers with physical infrastructure, or incumbent local exchange carriers, had such an obligation. This asymmetrical scheme of regulation became a problem when the two industries' businesses came to overlap and the boundary between them eroded. This transformation of industrial landscape, often called convergence, happened in the broadband Internet service provider market. To make matters worse,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] the cable operators were the leading camp although local telephone carriers were burdened by the open-access obligation.
Broadband high-speed internet has become a worldwide breakthrough for telecommunication services.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] The service has become crucial for businesses to be able to communicate with customers and is on the verge of being a standard public utility verses a luxury for residents.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] Although other services are still offered, like dial-up Internet access or satellite internet access, broadband internet is the most convenient and fastest mode of telecommunications.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] With broadband open access, the popularity of this service is in great demand. The debate of making incumbent cable operators obligated to allow competitors to wire into their infrastructure is comparable[tpl]Says who|date=June 2011[/tpl] to the Bell Operating Company (BOC) issue that split into the Regional Bell Operating Companies. Leading cable operators can easily avoid competition due to reasons such as lack of funding for those competitors to build their own backbone network, or even the lack of space available.
For the past couple of years now,[tpl]When|date=June 2011[/tpl] President Barack Obama has set out to try to resolve these issues. On February 10, 2011, he announced plans to expand wireless Internet access.http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/10/president-obama-details-plan-win-future-through-expanded-wireless-access President Obama Details Plan to Win the Future through Expanded Wireless Access This plan intends to provide high-speed wireless services to 98 percent of Americans or more. The idea behind this is to increase education among Americans, build businesses and profit, and support state-of-the-art technology for state officials. In terms of broadband open access, the plan will be deployed by leading carriers of high-speed Internet. However, the debate may still remain of how this helps the incoming service provider or smaller companies that already exist. Will small companies earn profit if the country is provided Internet through the leading companies?
Broadband open access has also brought on many questions of how services to competition is offered, such as unbundled access services sold to the new company. This includes services that can be hard to duplicate. The concept is like what service providers offer their own customers and having television, voice, and Internet service bundled into one package. Any competitor may rent office space in an incumbent's central office, place equipment to interconnect with their network, or purchase other related services.[tpl]cite book |title=Digital Crossroads |last=Nuechterlein |first=Jonathan |authorlink= |author2=Weiser, Philip J. |year=2005 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= |page= |pages=79 |url= |accessdate=[/tpl] The company can offer the same deal to a competing company requesting use of their network and facilities. The new entrant has a right to purchase access to the incumbent on an unbundled basis.[tpl]cite book |title=Digital Crossroads |last=Nuechterlein |first=Jonathan |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= |page= |pages=81 |url= |accessdate=[/tpl] Getting unbundled services means the new entrant has the opportunity to invest in its own network and therefore spend less on buying everything wholesale. They are able to make a profit using their own equipment and do not have to spend it all on the incumbent hardware and software provided.

[[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]
CATEGORIES: Fermi–Dirac statistics, Concepts in physics, Quantum field theory, Statistical mechanics

In quantum statistics, a branch of physics, Fermi–Dirac statistics describes a distribution of particles in certain systems comprising many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. It is named after Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac, who each discovered it independently, although Enrico Fermi defined the statistics earlier than Paul Dirac.
Fermi–Dirac (F–D) statistics applies to identical particles with half-integer spin in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Additionally, the particles in this system are assumed to have negligible mutual interaction. This allows the many-particle system to be described in terms of single-particle energy states. The result is the F–D distribution of particles over these states and includes the condition that no two particles can occupy the same state, which has a considerable effect on the properties of the system. Since F–D statistics applies to particles with half-integer spin, these particles have come to be called fermions. It is most commonly applied to electrons, which are fermions with spin 1/2. Fermi–Dirac statistics is a part of the more general field of statistical mechanics and uses the principles of quantum mechanics.

[[Distance-vector routing protocol]]
CATEGORIES: Routing protocols, Routing algorithms

In computer communication theory relating to packet-switched networks, a distance-vector routing protocol is one of the two major classes of routing protocols, the other major class being the link-state protocol. Distance-vector routing protocols use the Bellman–Ford algorithm, Ford–Fulkerson algorithm, or DUAL FSM (in the case of Cisco Systems's protocols) to calculate paths.
A distance-vector routing protocol requires that a router informs its neighbors of topology changes periodically. Compared to link-state protocols, which require a router to inform all the nodes in a network of topology changes, distance-vector routing protocols have less computational complexity and message overhead.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
The term distance vector refers to the fact that the protocol manipulates vectors (arrays) of distances to other nodes in the network.  The vector distance algorithm was the original ARPANET routing algorithm and was also used in the internet under the name of RIP(routing internet protocol). 
Examples of distance-vector routing protocols include RIPv1 and RIPv2 and IGRP.

The Jesus movement was a movement in Christianity beginning on the West Coast of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s and spreading primarily through North America and Europe, before dying out by the early 1980s. It was the major Christian element within the hippie counterculture, or, conversely, the major hippie element within some strands of Protestantism. Members of the movement were called Jesus people, or Jesus freaks.
The Jesus movement left a legacy of various denominations and other Christian organizations, and had an impact on both the development of the contemporary Christian right and the Christian left. Jesus music, which grew out of the movement, greatly influenced contemporary Christian music, helping to create various musical subgenres such as Christian rock and Christian metal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]

In the New Testament, it refers to the covenant love of God for humans, as well as the human reciprocal love for God; the term necessarily extends to the love of one’s fellow man.[ref]"agape." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 17 Sep. 2011.
[/ref] Although the word does not have specific religious connotation, the word has been used by a variety of contemporary and ancient sources, including biblical authors and Christian authors. Greek philosophers at the time of Plato and other ancient authors have used forms of the word to denote love of a spouse or family, or affection for a particular activity, in contrast to philia (an affection that could denote friendship, brotherhood or generally non-sexual affection) and eros, an affection of a sexual nature. Thomas Jay Oord has defined agape as "an intentional response to promote well-being when responding to that which has generated ill-being."[ref]“ The love racket: Defining love and agape for the love-and-science research program,” Zygon, vol. 40, no. 4 (December 2005), pp. 919-938 Defining Love (PDF)

(1846), Geography and sacred history of Syria, pp. 33–34
Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it has been inhabited since perhaps as early as the 6th millennium BC.Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition (2010) Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied since at least the latter part of the 3rd millennium BC;The Oxford encyclopedia of archaeology in the Near East (1997) and this is also when Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, in which it is noted for its commercial and military proficiency.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia (2010) Such a long history is probably due to its being a strategic trading point midway between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia (i.e. modern Iraq).
The city's significance in history has been its location at the end of the Silk Road, which passed through central Asia and Mesopotamia. When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline. At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo ceded its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important railway connecting it to Mosul. Then in the 1940s it lost its main access to the sea, Antioch and Alexandretta, also to Turkey. Finally, the isolation of Syria in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation, although perhaps it is this very decline that has helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. Until recently, Aleppo had been experiencing a noticeable revival and was slowly returning to the spotlight.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] It recently won the title of the "Islamic Capital of Culture 2006", and has also witnessed a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

[[Snail mail]]

CATEGORIES: Internet terminology, Dysphemisms, Postal system

Snail mail or smail (from snail + mail)—named after the snail with its slow speed—refers to letters and missives carried by conventional postal delivery services. Also named after the "snail-trail" used to glue the envelope. The phrase refers to the lag-time between dispatch of a letter and its receipt, versus the virtually instantaneous dispatch and delivery of its electronic equivalent, e-mail.
It is also known, more neutrally, as paper mail, postal mail,  land mail, or simply mail and post. An earlier term of the same type is surface mail, coined retrospectively after the development of airmail. This happened between the 1970s to 1990s.Cognitive English grammar, by Günter Radden, René Dirven, p. 4
Snail mail is also a term used in reference to penpalling. Snail mail penpals are those penpals that communicate with one another through the postal system, rather than on the internet which has become the more common  medium.
Some online groups also use paper mail through regular gift or craft hot topics. In some countries, services are available to print and deliver emails to those unable to receive email, like people with no computers or internet access.
Similar terminology was used in the 1840s to contrast the already-operating postal mail with the new telegraph. The Philadelphia North American stated: "The markets will no longer be dependent upon snail paced mails".Howe, Daniel Walker, "What Hath God Wrought:  The Transformation of America, 1815–1848", Oxford University Press, 2007.

[[Gene expression]]
CATEGORIES: Molecular biology, Gene expression

Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product. These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) or small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, the product is a functional RNA. The process of gene expression is used by all known life - eukaryotes (including multicellular organisms), prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), and utilized by viruses - to generate the macromolecular machinery for life.
Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism.
In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype. The genetic code stored in DNA is "interpreted" by gene expression, and the properties of the expression give rise to the organism's phenotype. Such phenotypes are often expressed by the synthesis of proteins that control the organism's shape, or that act as enzymes catalysing specific metabolic pathways characterising the organism.

Operation Urgent Fury was a 1983 United States-led invasion of Grenada, a Caribbean island nation with a population of about 91,000  located [tpl]convert|100|mi[/tpl] north of Venezuela, that resulted in a U.S. victory within a matter of weeks. Triggered by a bloody military coup which had ousted a four-year revolutionary government, the invasion resulted in a restoration of constitutional government.  Media outside the U.S. covered the invasion in a negative outlook despite the OAS request for intervention [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] (on the request of the U.S. government), Soviet and Cuban presence on the island and the presence of American medical students at the True Blue Medical Facility.
Grenada gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The leftist New Jewel Movement seized power in a coup in 1979, suspending the constitution. After a 1983 internal power struggle ended with the deposition and murder of revolutionary Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, the invasion began early on 25 October 1983, just two days and several hours after the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut (early 23 October Beirut time).
The U.S. Army's Rapid Deployment Force (1st, 2nd Ranger Battalions and 82nd Airborne Division Paratroopers), U.S. Marines, U.S. Army Delta Force and U.S. Navy SEALs and other combined forces comprised the 7,600 troops from the United States, Jamaica, and members of the Regional Security System (RSS)Country-data.com – Caribbean Islands: A Regional Security System defeated Grenadian resistance after a low-altitude airborne assault by the 75th Rangers on Point Salines Airport on the southern end of the island while a Marine helicopter and amphibious landing occurred on the northern end at Pearl's Airfield shortly afterward. The military government of Hudson Austin was deposed and replaced by a government appointed by Governor-General Paul Scoon until elections were held in 1984.

The date of the invasion is now a national holiday in Grenada, called Thanksgiving Day, and the Point Salines International Airport was renamed in honor of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.
The invasion highlighted issues with communication and coordination between the branches of the United States military, contributing to investigations and sweeping changes, in the form of the Goldwater–Nichols Act and other reorganizations.

[tpl]pp-semi-indef[/tpl][tpl]pp-move-indef[/tpl]
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830 – May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life.  After she studied at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she spent a short time at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence.
While Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly eighteen hundred poems were published during her lifetime.Sources differ as to the number of poems that were published, but most put it between seven and ten. The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation.McNeil (1986), 2. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.
Although most of her acquaintances were probably aware of Dickinson's writing, it was not until after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems—that the breadth of Dickinson's work became apparent. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, both of whom heavily edited the content. A complete and mostly unaltered collection of her poetry became available for the first time in 1955 when The Poems of Emily Dickinson was published by scholar Thomas H. Johnson. Despite some unfavorable reviews and some skepticism during the late 19th and early 20th century as to Dickinson's literary prowess, she is now almost universally considered to be one of the most important American poets.Bloom (1999), 9; Ford (1966), 122.

[[Change ringing]]

CATEGORIES: Bell ringing, Permutations, English culture, Christian music genres, English music

Change ringing is the art of ringing a set of tuned bells in a series of mathematical patterns called "changes".
Change ringing differs from many other forms of campanology (such as carillon ringing) in that no attempt is made to produce a conventional melody.
Today, change ringing can be found all over the world, performed in a variety of media, but it remains most popular in English churches, where it was developed in the 17th century. A church's bell tower typically contains a set of few large church bells rigged to swing freely and known as a ring of bells.
The considerable inertias involved mean that each bell usually requires its own ringer. Thus, contrasted with a carillon, in which a large number of bells are struck by hammers, all tied into a central framework so that one carillonneur can control them all, a set of such bells is comparatively unwieldy—hence the emergence of permutations rather than melody as an organizing principle.

After  the conquest of Eastern Germany by the Soviet Army and the partition in 1945 the eastern part of Lusatia along the  Lusatian Neisse river was handed over to Poland (see Oder-Neisse Line). In the Polish part is spoken Polish, and in the German part German, Upper- and Lower Sorbian. The biggest Lusatian town is Cottbus/Chóśebuz.

A prize in honour of Abel was first proposed by Sophus Lie (1842–1899). Lie's death marked an interruption in the establishment of the award, and King Oscar II's attempt to establish the award in 1902 was unsuccessful, complicated by the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway three years later.

[tpl]About|the chemical compound||KCL (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]KCL[/tpl]

The chemical compound potassium chloride (KCl) is a metal halide salt composed of potassium and chlorine. In its pure state, it is odorless and has a white or colorless vitreous crystal appearance, with a crystal structure that cleaves easily in three directions. Potassium chloride crystals are face-centered cubic. Potassium chloride was historically known as "muriate of potash". This name is occasionally still encountered in association with its use as a fertilizer. Potash varies in color from pink or red to white depending on the mining and recovery process used. White potash, sometimes referred to as soluble potash, is usually higher in analysis and is used primarily for making liquid starter fertilizers. KCl is used in medicine, scientific applications, and food processing. It occurs naturally as the mineral sylvite and in combination with sodium chloride as sylvinite.

[[Ultralight aviation]]

CATEGORIES: Ultralight aircraft, Air sports

Ultralight aviation (called microlight aviation in some countries) is the flying of lightweight, 1 or 2 seat fixed-wing aircraft. Some countries differentiate between weight shift and 3-axis aircraft, calling the former "microlight" and the latter "ultralight".
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, mostly stimulated by the hang gliding movement, many people sought affordable powered flight. As a result, many aviation authorities set up definitions of lightweight, slow-flying aeroplanes that could be subject to minimum regulations. The resulting aeroplanes are commonly called "ultralight aircraft" or "microlights", although the weight and speed limits differ from country to country. In Europe the sporting (FAI) definition limits the maximum take-off weight to [tpl]convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] ([tpl]convert|472.5|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] if a ballistic parachute is installed) and a maximum stalling speed of [tpl]convert|65|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The definition means that the aircraft has a slow landing speed and short landing roll in the event of an engine failure.Boric, Marino, Spoilt For Choice, Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al (editors): World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 10. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X
In most affluent countries, microlights or ultralight aircraft now account for a significant percentage of the global civilian-owned aircraft. For instance in Canada in October 2010, the ultralight aircraft fleet made up to 19% of the total civilian aircraft registered. In other countries that do not register ultralight aircraft, like the United States, it is unknown what proportion of the total fleet they make up.[tpl]cite web|url = http://wwwapps2.tc.gc.ca/Saf-Sec-Sur/2/ccarcs/aspscripts/en/monthsumairbycat.asp|title = Summary of the Canadian Civil Aircraft Register - Number of Aircraft by Category of Aircraft - October 2010 |accessdate =12 November 2010|last = Transport Canada|authorlink = |date=October 2010[/tpl] In countries where there is no specific extra regulation, ultralights are considered regular aircraft and subject to certification requirements for both aircraft and pilot.

The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released in March 1982. It saw the debut of vocalist Bruce Dickinson, and the final appearance of drummer Clive Burr.
The Number of the Beast met with considerable critical and commercial success and was a landmark release for the band, becoming their first album to reach No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, and be certified platinum in the US. The album also produced the singles "Run to the Hills" and "The Number of the Beast", the former of which was the band's first top-ten UK single. The album was also controversial – particularly in the US – due to the religious nature of its lyrics and its artwork.
Since the release of The Number of the Beast and its subsequent tour, The Beast on the Road, "The Beast" has become an alternate name for Iron Maiden, and was later used in the titles of some of their compilations and live releases, including Best of the Beast and Visions of the Beast.

[[Ariane 3]]
CATEGORIES: Ariane (rocket family), European Space Agency

Ariane 3 was a European expendable carrier rocket, which was used for eleven launches between 1984 and 1989. It was a member of the Ariane family of rockets, derived from the Ariane 2, although it flew before this. It was designed by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, and produced by Aérospatiale in France.
The Ariane 3 followed the same basic design as the earlier Ariane 1, but incorporated modifications made for the Ariane 2.  Unlike the Ariane 2, two solid-fuelled PAP strap-on booster rockets were used to augment the first stage at liftoff.
The core of the Ariane 3 was essentially an Ariane 2. The first stage was powered by four Viking 2B bipropellant engines, burning Nitrogen tetroxide in an UH 25 oxidiser, which was a mixture of three parts UDMH and one part Hydrazine. The second stage was powered by a Viking 4B, which used the same fuel-oxidiser combination. The third stage used a cryogenically fuelled HR7-B engine, burning liquid hydrogen in liquid oxygen. On some flights, a Mage 2 kick motor was flown as a fourth stage.

CATEGORIES: Ariane (rocket family), European Space Agency

Ariane 2 was a European expendable carrier rocket, which was used for six launches between 1986 and 1989. It was a member of the Ariane family of rockets, and was produced by Aérospatiale in France.
The Ariane 2 was derived from the earlier Ariane 1, with stretched first and third stages. Its payload capacity was increased to [tpl]convert|2175|kg[/tpl] to a geosynchronous transfer orbit. It first flew on 31 May 1986 carrying the Intelsat-5A F-14 satellite. The third stage failed to ignite, and the rocket was destroyed by range safety. Following this, five more launches were conducted, all of which were successful. The last Ariane 2 launch occurred on 2 April 1989, successfully placing Tele-X into orbit.

The Proms, more formally known as The BBC Proms, or The Henry Wood Promenade Concerts presented by the BBC, is an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music concerts and other events held annually, predominantly in the Royal Albert Hall in London. Founded in 1895, each season currently consists of more than 70 concerts in the Albert Hall, a series of chamber concerts at Cadogan Hall, additional Proms in the Park events across the United Kingdom on the last night, and associated educational and children's events. In 2009 the total number of concerts reached 100 for the first time. In the context of classical music festivals, Jiří Bělohlávek has described the Proms as "the world's largest and most democratic musical festival".Jiří Bělohlávek, Speech from The Last Night of the Proms 2007, 8 September 2007.
Prom is short for promenade concert, a term which originally referred to outdoor concerts in London's pleasure gardens, where the audience was free to stroll around while the orchestra was playing. In fact this tradition has been revived in parks and stately homes around the UK at promenade concerts such as the Battle Proms. In the context of the BBC Proms Promming now refers to the use of the standing areas inside the hall (the arena and gallery) for which ticket prices are much lower than for the reserved seating. Single-concert standing Promming tickets for either the Arena or Gallery can be bought only on the day of the concert, which can give rise to long queues for well-known artists or works. Proms concert-goers, particularly those who stand, are sometimes described as "Promenaders", but are most commonly referred to as "Prommers". Prommers can buy full-season tickets instead for guaranteed entry to every concert in the season (until 20 minutes before the concert is due to start), although not the assurance of a particular standing position. A number of Prommers are particularly keen in their attendance. In 1997, one programme in the BBC documentary series Modern Times covered this dedicated following of enthusiasts.

The Battle of Kosovo, also known as the Battle of Kosovo Field or the Battle of Blackbird's Field ([tpl]lang-sr|Косовска битка, Бој на Косову; Kosovska bitka; Boj na Kosovu[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-tr|Kosova Meydan Savaşı[/tpl]), took place on St. Vitus' Day, June 15,[tpl]Cref2|A|2[/tpl] 1389, between the army led by Serbian Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, and the invading army of the Ottoman Empire under the leadership of Sultan Murad I. The army under Prince Lazar consisted of his own troops, a contingent led by Serbian nobleman Vuk Branković, and a contingent sent from Bosnia by King Tvrtko I, commanded by Vlatko Vuković.Fine (1994), pp. 409–11Emmert (1991) Prince Lazar was the ruler of Moravian Serbia, and the most powerful among the Serbian regional lords of the time, while Vuk Branković ruled a part of Kosovo and other areas, recognizing Lazar as his overlord. The Battle of Kosovo took place in the Kosovo Polje, about 5 kilometers northwest of modern-day Pristina.
Reliable historical accounts of the battle are scarce; however, a critical comparison with historically contemporaneous battles (such as Angora or Nikopolis) enables reliable reconstruction. The bulk of both armies was wiped out in the battle; both Lazar and Murad lost their lives in it. Although Ottomans managed to annihilate the Serbian army, they also suffered high casualties which delayed their progress. Serbs were left with too few men to effectively defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Consequently, one after the other, the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals became so in the following years.
The Battle of Kosovo is particularly important to Serbian history, tradition, and national identity.Duijzings, G., Religion and the Politics of Identity in Kosovo (London: Hurst, 2000)

Aphrodisias ([tpl]IPAc-en|æ|f|r|ɵ|ˈ|d|ɪ|s|i|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Ἀφροδισιάς|Aphrodisiás[/tpl]) was a small ancient Greek city in Caria. Its site is located near the modern village of Geyre, Turkey, about [tpl]convert|230|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south-east of İzmir and about [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] inland from the coast.
Aphrodisias was named after Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, who had here her unique cult image, the Aphrodite of Aphrodisias. According to the Byzantine encyclopedic compilation called the Suda, before being known as Aphrodisias, the city had held three previous names: Lelégōn Pólis (Λελέγων πόλις, "City of the Leleges"),For Greeks, "Leleges" denoted an ancient pre-Greek people. Megálē Pólis (Μεγάλη Πόλις, "Great City"), and Ninóē (Νινόη).See Suda Online s.v. Ninoe, http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?searchstr=nu+416 (accessed 25-12-2006); the elite of Aphrodisias linked their founding to the Assyrian ruler called in Greek Ninus, the eponymous founder also of Nineveh.
Sometime before 640, in the Late Antique period, the city was renamed Stauroúpolis (Σταυρούπολις, "City of the Cross").Siméon Vailhé, "Stauropolis" The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1912 full text, citing Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiæ episcopatuum, 534. The name Tauropolis, said to have been borne by the town prior to that of Stauropolis, is an error of several scholars, e.g. Revue des études grecques 19:228-30; the error 'Tauropolis' derives from inscription IAph 42: see discussion by Roueché at ALA VI.48

Philistus ([tpl]lang-grc|Φίλιστος[/tpl]; c. 432 – 356 BC), son of Archomenidas, was Greek historian of Sicily.  Philistus was born at Syracuse about the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. He was a faithful supporter of the elder Dionysius, and commander of the citadel. Cicero who had a high opinion of his work, calls him the miniature Thucydides (pusillus Thucydides).Eric William Marsden: Greek and Roman Artillery: Historical Development, The Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969, ISBN 978-0-19-814268-3, p.48f. He was admitted by the Alexandrian critics into the canon of historiographers, and his work was highly valued by Alexander the Great.
Philistus was quite wealthy.  Before his rise to power, Dionysius criticized the generals of Syracuse in their poor performance against the Carthagenians.  When the assembly fined Dionysius for his seditious language, Philistus stepped in to pay Dionysius' fines, with the promise to continue paying for them so long as the council saw fit to issue them.  It was through Philistus' support that Dionysius was able to rise to power and control Syracuse.
In 386, Philistus married the daughter of Leptines I, who was Dionysius' niece.  Because Dionysius had not been consulted, he feared an alliance between his brother and Philistus against him, Dionysius exiled both from Syracuse.
He settled at Thurii, but afterwards removed to Adria, where he remained until the death of Dionysius (366 BC).  During his stay at Adria, Philistus occupied himself with the composition of his history of Sicily in eleven books. The first part (bks. i—vii) comprised the history of the island from the earliest times to the capture of Agrigentum by the Carthaginians (406 BC); the second, the history of the elder and the younger Dionysius (down to 363 BC). From this point the work was carried on by Philistus's fellow countryman, Athanas.
Philistus was then recalled by the younger Dionysius, whom he persuaded to dismiss Plato and Dion.Plutarch: Life of Dion, ch. 11-16.[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2011[/tpl] When Dion set sail from Zacynthus with the object of liberating Syracuse in (356), Philistus was entrusted by Dionysius II with the command of the fleet.  After a lengthy sea battle, his ship was surrounded.  Philistus took his own life to avoid retribution from his countrymen.

Corfe Castle is a village and civil parish  in the English county of Dorset.  It is the site of a ruined castle of the same name. The village and castle stand over a gap in the Purbeck Hills on the route between Wareham and Swanage. The village lies in the gap below the castle, and is some eight kilometres (five miles) south-east of Wareham, and the same distance west of Swanage.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus ([tpl]lang-grc|Διονύσιος Ἀλεξάνδρου Ἁλικαρνᾱσσεύς[/tpl], Dionysios son of Aléxandros, of Halikarnassós, c. 60 BCE – after 7 BCE) was a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, who flourished during the reign of Caesar Augustus. His literary style was Atticistic — imitating Classical Attic Greek in its prime.

Hegesias of MagnesiaMagnesia ad Sipylum, on the plains of Lydia. ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἡγησίας ὁ Μάγνης[/tpl]) (in Lydia), Greek rhetorician, and historian, flourished about 300 BC. Strabo (xiv. 648), speaks of him as the founder of the florid Asiatic style of composition.
Agatharchides, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (De compositione verborum 18) and Cicero all speak of him in disparaging terms, although Varro seems to have approved of his work. He professed to imitate the simplest style of Lysias, avoiding long periods, and expressing himself in short, jerky sentences, without modulation or finish. His vulgar affectation and bombast made his writings a mere caricature of the old Attic. Dionysius describes his composition as tinselled, ignoble and effeminate. According to Gualtiero Calboli, Hegesias and his fellow Asiatics rejected Attic examples (and in particular the example of Thucydides) in favor of a return to "the models of Ionic and sophistic prose."Roberto Nicolai, "Ktêma es aei: Aspects of the Reception of Thucydides in the Ancient World," in Jeffrey Rusten (ed.) Thucydides: Oxford Readings in Classical Studies, p. 386
It is generally supposed, from the fragment quoted as a specimen by Dionysius (and cf. Plutarch, Life of Alexander 3), that Hegesias is to be classed among the writers of lives of Alexander the Great. This fragment describes the treatment of Gaza and its inhabitants by Alexander after its conquest, but it is possible that it is only part of an epideictic or show-speech, not of an historical work. This view is supported by a remark of Agatharchides in Photius (cod. 250) that the only aim of Hegesias was to exhibit his skill in describing sensational events.

[[Unschooling]]
CATEGORIES: Homeschooling, Pedagogy, Philosophy of education, Alternative education, Deschooling and criticism of the school system

Unschooling is an educational method and philosophy that rejects compulsory school as a primary means for learning. Unschoolers learn through their natural life experiences including play, household responsibilities, personal interests and curiosity, internships and work experience, travel, books, elective classes, family, mentors, and social interaction. Unschooling encourages exploration of activities initiated by the children themselves, believing that the more personal learning is, the more meaningful, well-understood and therefore useful it is to the child. While courses may occasionally be taken, unschooling questions the usefulness of standard curricula, conventional grading methods, and other features of traditional schooling in maximizing the education of each unique child.
The term "unschooling" was coined in the 1970s and used by educator John Holt, widely regarded as the "father" of unschooling.[tpl]cite web|title=Unschooling or homeschooling?|accessdate=2008-09-04|url=http://www.unschooling.org/fun12_unschooling.htm|author=Billy Greer[/tpl]
While often considered a subset of homeschooling, unschoolers may be as philosophically separate from other homeschoolers as they are from advocates of conventional schooling.  While homeschooling has been subject to widespread public debate, little media attention has been given to unschooling in particular. Popular critics of unschooling tend to view it as an extreme educational philosophy, with concerns that unschooled children lack the social skills, structure, and motivation of their peers, especially in the job market, while proponents of unschooling say exactly the opposite is true: self-directed education in a natural environment better equips a child to handle the "real world."[tpl]cite web|title=Readers share heated opinions on "unschooling"|date=2006-10-31|accessdate=2008-09-04|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15148804/[/tpl]

[[Greenbelt festival]]

Greenbelt Festival is a festival of arts, faith and justice held annually in England since 1974. Greenbelt has grown from a Christian music festival with an audience of 1,500 young Christians to its current more inclusive festival attended by around 20,000 - Christians and non-Christians. 
The festival regularly attracts the biggest names of Christian music and many mainstream musicians. Those that have played the festival in the past include both new and established musicians, mostly playing rock, folk and pop music. This list encompasses U2, Moby, Cliff Richard, Bruce Cockburn, Martyn Joseph, Steve Taylor, Daniel Amos, Phatfish, Servant, Midnight Oil, Michael Franti and Spearhead, Over the Rhine, Iona, Amy Grant, Miles Cain, Lamb, Kevin Max, Lambchop, Goldie, Jamelia, After the Fire, Larry Norman, Randy Stonehill, Asian Dub Foundation, The Polyphonic Spree, Aqualung, Dum Dums, The Proclaimers, Daniel Bedingfield, Eden Burning, Duke Special, Why?, Athlete, Sixpence None the Richer and Delirious?.
Greenbelt is also a venue for teaching and discussion around (but not exclusively within) the Christian faith, and has attracted a large number of famous Christian speakers, including Rowan Williams (the former Archbishop of Canterbury) who is currently the festival's patron. However, the festival also welcomes anyone who the organisers believe 'speaks for justice', and has recently had Anita Roddick, Peter Tatchell, Bill Drummond and Billy Bragg sharing their thoughts. Greenbelt sees itself as having never been shy of tackling controversial issues and providing a 'safe space for honest debate'.
More recently with its links to the NGO Christian Aid, Greenbelt has become heavily involved in campaigns for trade justice. The festival was one of the main catalysts for the huge Jubilee 2000 movement. Greenbelt is also a Christian showcase for performing arts, visual arts and alternative worship.

[[Urination]]

CATEGORIES: Articles containing video clips, Excretion, Human positions, Medical signs, Urine, Urology

Urination is the release of urine from the urinary bladder through the urethra to the urinary meatus outside of the body. It is also known medically as micturition, voiding, uresis, or, rarely, emiction, and known colloquially by various names including tinkling, peeing, weeing, and pissing. In healthy humans (and many other animals) the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury, urination may occur as an involuntary reflex. In some animals, in addition to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. Physiologically, urination involves coordination between the central, autonomic, and somatic nervous systems. Brain centers that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] In male placental mammals, urine is ejected through the penis.[tpl]cite book|author=Marvalee H.

Arab Americans ([tpl]lang-ar|عرب أميركا[/tpl] `Arab Amrīkā) are Americans of Arab ethnic, cultural and linguistic heritage or identity, who identify themselves as Arab. Arab Americans trace ancestry to any of the various waves of immigrants of the countries comprising the Arab World. Americans descended from immigrants of the Arab world via other countries are also included.
According to the Arab American Institute (AAI), countries of origin for Arab Americans include Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.[tpl]cite web|title=Arab American Institute - Texas|url=http://www.aaiusa.org/page/file/b44c4328067fdc4dce_fybmvypay.pdf/TXdemographics.pdf|publisher=Arab American Institute|accessdate=26 November 2012[/tpl]
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there are 1,697,570 Arab Americans in the United States.http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&prodType=table 290,893 persons defined themselves as simply Arab, and a further 224,241 as Other Arab. Other groups on the 2010 Census are listed by nation of origin, and some may or may not be Arabs, or regard themselves as Arabs. The largest subgroup is by far the Lebanese Americans, with 501,907, followed by; Egyptian American with 190,078, Syrian American with 148,214, Iraqi American with 105,981, Palestinian American with 93,438, Moroccan American with 82,073 and Jordanian American with 61,664. Over 1/4 of all Arab Americans claimed two ancestries,  Arab Americans, and Arabs in general, comprise a highly diverse amalgam of groups with differing ancestral origins, religious backgrounds and historic identities. Instead, the ties that bind are a shared heritage by virtue of common linguistic, cultural, and political traditions.
A number of peoples from predominantly Arab countries resident in the United States are not classified as Arabs, including; Assyrians (aka Chaldo-Assyrians) Berbers, Jews, Kurds, Turkmen, Azeris , Mandeans,  Circassians, Shabaki, Armenians, Turks, Mhallami, Georgians, Yazidis, Greeks, Iranians and Kawliya/Roma.

The standard definition of the Arab world comprises the 22 countries and territories of the Arab League stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. It has a combined population of around 422 million people, with over half under 25 years of age.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/events/prizes-and-celebrations/celebrations/international-days/world-arabic-language-day/ |title= World Arabic Language Day |work= UNESCO |date= 18 December 2012 |accessdate= 12 February 2014[/tpl]
The sentiment of Arab nationalism arose in the second half of the 19th century along with other nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire. The Arab League was formed in 1945 to represent the interests of the Arabs, and especially to pursue the political unification of the Arab countries, a project known as Pan-Arabism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-113946363.html |title=Arab League Sends Delegation to Iraq |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=8 October 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-113950671.html |title=Arab League Warns of Civil War in Iraq |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=8 October 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2011[/tpl]
The term "Arab world" is usually rejected by those living in the region, who do not consider themselves Arabs, like Berbers and Kurds, as it implies the entire region is Arab in its identity, population, and origin, whereas the original homeland of the Arabs is the Arabian Peninsula. The term is also rejected by some indigenous Semitic minorities such as the Jews, Assyrians, etc. and many of Maronites and Copts, as they pre-date Arabs in North Africa, Mesopotamia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

Mordred or Modred ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|d|r|ɛ|d[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-cy|Medraut[/tpl], Medrod, etc.) is a character in the Arthurian legend, known as a notorious traitor who fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camlann, where he was killed and Arthur fatally wounded. Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin Moderātus.Cane, Meredith.

Drusilla, or Dru, is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt for the American television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. The character is portrayed by American actress Juliet Landau. Drusilla is introduced alongside her lover Spike (James Marsters) in the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to serve as new antagonists to the series' heroine, vampire Slayer Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar). In contrast to the series' previous central villain, the ancient and ceremonious Master (Mark Metcalf), Spike and Dru were introduced as a more unconventional but equally dangerous pair of vampires.
Though Spike and Dru had not been conceived as necessarily having to be either British or American, Landau chose to portray Drusilla with a Cockney accent in keeping with the characters' "Sid and Nancy analogy". Drusilla's physical appearance also drew from additional sources, such as supermodel Kate Moss and the mid-1990s heroin chic aesthetic. The character's backstory gives her ties to Buffy's boyfriend Angel (David Boreanaz), and it is gradually established over the course of Buffy and Angel. A young psychic in Victorian London with a potential for sainthood, Drusilla was driven insane by Angel before he eventually turned her into a vampire. In Angel, the character recurs both in the present-day narrative and in flashbacks which depict the title character's adventures across Europe and Asia with Angel and Spike. After Angel ended in 2005, the character continued to appear in Expanded Universe materials in other media. Landau went on to co-write a two-issue Drusilla story arc for IDW Publishing's Angel comic book series in 2009, continuing her character's storyline.

The Nebraska Cornhuskers (often abbreviated to Huskers) is the name given to several sports teams of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. The university is a member of the Big Ten Conference. The Cornhuskers compete in NCAA Division I, fielding 22 varsity teams in 15 sports.
Early nicknames for the university's athletic teams included the "Hawkeyes" (which is now associated with the University of Iowa), the "Antelopes" (which the University of Nebraska at Kearney later adopted), the "Old Gold Knights", the "'Bugeaters'" and the "Mankilling Mastodons".  The name Cornhuskers first appeared in the school newspaper as "We Have Met The Cornhuskers And They Are Ours" referring to a 20–18 upset victory over Iowa in 1893.  The name would be used again, this time to refer to Nebraska by Charles "Cy" Sherman in The Nebraska State Journal during the 1899 season and would replace all other names by 1900.http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=2802http://www.huskernews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/1999/01/01/380d0d7a3
The Cornhuskers have two official mascots, Herbie Husker and Lil' Red.
The Cornhuskers participate in 21 sports sponsored by the Big Ten Conference. In addition the Huskers field varsity teams in two sports not sponsored by the Big Ten, namely rifle and bowling. The rifle team is a member of the single-sport Great America Rifle Conference, while the bowling team competes as an independent.
For over 100 years, the Cornhuskers participated in what is now known as the Big 12 Conference, having been a member since the conference's earliest predecessor, the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, later the Big Eight Conference, was founded.

[[Flight number]]

CATEGORIES: Civil aviation

A flight number, when combined with the name of the airline and the date, identifies a particular flight. This callsign should not be confused with the tail number of the aircraft, although both can be used as a call-sign as used in general aviation. A particular aircraft may fly several different flights in one day, and different aircraft may be used for the same flight number on successive days.
A number of conventions have been developed for defining flight numbers, although these vary widely from airline to airline.  Eastbound and northbound flights are traditionally assigned even numbers, while westbound and southbound flights have odd numbers. Other airlines will use an odd number for an outbound flight and use the next even number for the reverse inbound flight.  For destinations served by multiple flights per day, numbers tend to increase during the day.  Hence, a flight from point A to point B might be flight 101 and the return flight from B to A would be 102, while the next pair of flights on the same route would usually be assigned codes 103 and 104.
Flight numbers of less than three digits are often assigned to long-haul or otherwise premium flights. Flight number 1 is often used for an airline's "flagship" service. For example, British Airways flight 1 was the early morning supersonic Concorde service from London to New York City; Air New Zealand flight 1 is the daily service from London to Auckland via Los Angeles; American Airlines Flight 1 is the daily flight from New York to Los Angeles; and El Al flight 1 is the daily overnight service from Tel Aviv to New York City.  Four-digit numbers in the range 1000 to 4999 typically represent regional affiliate flights, while numbers larger than 5000 are generally codeshare numbers for flights operated by different airlines or even railways.
Likewise, flight numbers larger than 9000 are usually referred to as ferry flights, that carry no passengers and are only to move an aircraft from point A to point B, where it is supposed to start a new commercial flight. Flight numbers starting with 8 are often used for charter flights, but it always depends on the commercial carrier's choice.
Flight numbers are often taken out of use after a crash or a serious incident. For example, following the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, the airline changed the flight number for subsequent flights following the same route to 229. Also, American Airlines Flight 77, which regularly flew from Dulles International Airport in Washington, DC, to Los Angeles International Airport, was changed to Flight 149 after the September 11, 2001 attacks. On the other hand, other considerations may lead an airline not to change a flight number; for instance, the aforementioned "flagship" American Airlines Flight 1 retains its designation despite a major accident in 1962. The most recent flight number change was from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 to Malaysia Airlines Flight 318, as well as flight 371 to 319. 
Note that, although 'flight number' is the term used colloquially, the official term as defined in the Standard Schedules Information Manual (SSIM) published annually by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Schedules Information Standards Committee (SISC), is flight code. Officially the term 'flight number' refers to the numeric part (up to four digits) of a flight code. For example, in the flight codes BA2490 and BA2491A, "2490" and "2491" are flight numbers. Even within the airline and airport industry it is common to use the colloquial term rather than the official term.
Flight numbers are also sometimes used for spacecraft, though a flight number for an expendable rocket (say, Ariane 5 Flight 501) might more reasonably be called the serial number of the vehicle used, since an expendable rocket can only be launched once.  Space Shuttle missions used numbers with the STS prefix, for example, STS-93.

[[Mind Bomb]]

CATEGORIES: The The albums, 1989 albums, Albums produced by Roli Mosimann, Epic Records albums

Mind Bomb is the third studio album by The The, released by Some Bizzare/Epic on July 11, 1989 and recorded between October 1988 and May 1989.
For this album, instead of recording with numerous session musicians as he did previously, Matt Johnson assembled a genuine band behind him to play the bulk of the instrumentation (additional flourishes were nevertheless provided by sessioneers, most notably keyboard player Wix). Instead of the darkly polished dance-pop styling of earlier albums Soul Mining and Infected, Mind Bomb opens up the music to reveal a slow, winding textured world of sound, thanks in no small means to ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. Lyrical subjects include politics, religion, and romance. The band would also play a world tour and record a follow-up, Dusk. After that, Johnson dissolved it and went about his business alone again. In 2002 the album saw a "RE-MASTERED/RE-ISSUE" on CD.

[[Flight]]

CATEGORIES: Aerodynamics, Flight

Flight is the process by which an object moves, through an atmosphere (especially the air) or beyond it (as in the case of spaceflight), by generating aerodynamic lift, propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement, without direct support from any surface.
Many things fly, from natural aviators such as birds, bats and insects to human inventions such as missiles, aircraft such as airplanes, helicopters and balloons, to rockets such as spacecraft.
The engineering aspects of flight are studied in aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the air, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and in ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles.

Everclear is an American alternative rock band formed in Portland, Oregon in 1991. The band was formed by Art Alexakis, the band's lead songwriter, (vocalist and guitarist, and for most of the band's height of popularity, consisted of Craig Montoya on bass guitar  and Greg Eklund on drums. The band found success with their albums first three albums on Capitol Records, Sparkle and Fade, So Much for the Afterglow, and Songs from an American Movie Vol. One: Learning How to Smile, which all were certified platinum in sales. However, sales suffered with Songs from an American Movie Vol. Two: Good Time for a Bad Attitude and Slow Motion Daydream, leading Montoya and Eklund to leave the band in late 2003.
After a brief stint of solo performances, Alexakis decided to push forward with the Everclear name, finding new musicians to perform with and releasing two more albums, Welcome to the Drama Club and Invisible Stars. Starting in 2012, Alexakis has also started up a 1990s nostalgia tour, called the Summerland Tour, that occurs every summer with Everclear and other 1990s alternative rock bands.

Since 1984, singer and guitarist Buzz Osborne (also known as King Buzzo) and drummer Dale Crover have been the band's ongoing members. The band was named after a supervisor at a Thriftway in Montesano, Washington, where Osborne also worked as a clerk. "Melvin" was despised by other employees, and the band's members felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name.
Melvins' music is influenced by Black Flag's mix of punk and metal on their album My War, and other slow punk acts like Swans, Flipper and Wipers, but also by some hard rock and metal bands such as Kiss and Alice Cooper; however, their idiosyncratic approach, bizarre sense of humor, and experimentation make neat categorization difficult. Buzzo has also stated that his guitar playing is more influenced by Black Flag than Black Sabbath, with whom they are often compared.
They often favor very slow tempos, and their sludgy sound was a strong influence on grunge music, especially Nirvana, Soundgarden, Green River, and many other bands from Seattle. These bands, however, tended to use more conventional musical structures with this sound.

The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list. This sorting algorithm is only marginally more difficult to implement than a bubble sort, and solves the problem of turtles in bubble sorts. It provides only marginal performance improvements, and does not improve asymptotic performance; like the bubble sort, it is not of practical interest (insertion sort is preferred for simple sorts), though it finds some use in education.

[[Needle lace]]

CATEGORIES: Lace

Needle lace (also known as needlelace or needle-made lace or point lace) is a type of lace created using a needle and thread to stitch up hundreds of small stitches to form the lace itself.
In its purest form the only equipment and materials used are a needle, thread and scissors. This form of lace making originated in Armenia where there is evidence of an Armenian needle lace making tradition dating back to the pre-Christian era. Turkish needle lace is also very popular around the world. This form however arose separately from what is usually termed needle lace and is generally referred to as knotted lace.  Such lace is very durable and will not unravel if one or more loops are broken.  
Beginning in the 17th century in Italy, a variety of styles developed where the work is started by securing heavier guiding threads onto a stiff background (such as thick paper) with stitches that can later be removed.
The work is then built up using a variety of stitches - the most basic being a variety of buttonhole or blanket stitch. When the entire area is covered with the stitching, the stay-stitches are released and the lace comes away from the paper. See reticella.
Needle lace is also used to create the fillings or insertions in cutwork.

[[Crocheted lace]]

CATEGORIES: Lace, Crochet

Crochet lace is an application of the art of crochet. Generally it uses finer threads and more decorative styles of stitching - often with flowing lines or scalloped edges to give interest. Variation of the size of the holes also gives a piece a "lacy' look.
Originally crocheted lace was not regarded as true lace. Crocheting was considered easy and less time consuming, but otherwise clearly inferior surrogate for "true" lace such as bobbin lace, needle lace or  netting. The first examples of crocheted lace try to reproduce the products of other lacemaking techniques as faithfully as possible. Later, the many possibilities and inherent beauty of crocheted lace were appreciated more.
Main styles of crocheted lace include filet crochet, Irish crochet and its modern derivatives, pineapple crochet. Freeform crocheted lace also exists, examples of which are pieces striving to imitate reticella lace.

In political science, an initiative (also known as a popular or citizens' initiative) is a means by which a petition signed by a certain minimum number of registered voters can force a public vote (plebiscite).
The initiative may take the form of a direct initiative or an indirect initiative. In a direct initiative, a measure is put directly to a vote after being submitted by a petition. In an indirect initiative, a measure is first referred to the legislature, and then put to a popular vote only if not enacted by the legislature.
The vote may be on a proposed statute, constitutional amendment, charter amendment or local ordinance, or to simply oblige the executive or legislature to consider the subject by submitting it to the order of the day. It is a form of direct democracy.

Alpha–beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.). It stops completely evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.

[[Additive color]]

CATEGORIES: Color space, Color

Additive color is color created by mixing light of two or more different colors. Red, green, and blue are the additive primary colors normally used in additive color system. Additive color is in contrast to subtractive color, in which colors are created by subtracting (absorbing) parts of the spectrum of light present in ordinary white light, by means of colored pigments or dyes, such as those in paints, inks, and the three dye layers in typical color photographs on film.
The combination of two of the standard three additive primary colors in equal proportions produces an additive secondary color—cyan, magenta or yellow—which, in the form of dyes or pigments, are the standard primary colors in subtractive color systems. The subtractive system using primaries that are the secondaries of the additive system can be viewed as an alternative approach to reproducing a wide range of colors by controlling the relative amounts of red, green, and blue light that reach the eye.
Computer monitors and televisions are the most common examples of additive color. Examination with a sufficiently powerful magnifying lens will reveal that each pixel in CRT, LCD and most other types of color video displays is composed of red, green and blue sub-pixels, the light from which combines in various proportions to produce all the other colors as well as white and shades of gray. The colored sub-pixels do not overlap on the screen, but when viewed from a normal distance they overlap and blend on the eye's retina, producing the same result as external superimposition.
Another example of additive color can be found in the overlapping projected colored lights often used in theatrical lighting for plays, concerts, circus shows and night clubs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/044.php|title=The Dimensions of Color|author=David Briggs|year=2007|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]
The full gamut of color available in any additive color system is defined by all the possible combinations of all the possible luminosities of each primary color in that system.  In chromaticity space, the gamut is a plane convex polygon with corners at the primaries. For three primaries, it is a triangle.
Results obtained when mixing additive colors are often counterintuitive for people accustomed to the subtractive color system of pigments, dyes, inks and other substances that present color to the eye by reflection rather than emission. For example, in subtractive color systems, green is a combination of yellow and cyan; in additive color, red plus green makes yellow. Additive color is a result of the way the eye detects color, and is not a property of light. There is a vast difference between a pure spectral yellow light, with a wavelength of approximately 580 nm, and a mixture of red and green light. However, both stimulate our eyes in a similar manner, so we do not detect that difference, and both are yellow light to the human eye. (see eye (cytology), color vision.)

A barnacle is a type of arthropod belonging to infraclass Cirripedia in the subphylum Crustacea, and is hence related to crabs and lobsters. Barnacles are exclusively marine, and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters, typically in erosive settings. They are sessile (non-motile) suspension feeders, and have two nektonic (active swimming) larval stages. Around 1,220 barnacle species are currently known.[tpl]cite book |author=Martin Walters & Jinny Johnson |title=The World of Animals |publisher=Bath, Somerset: Parragon |year=2007 |isbn=1-4054-9926-5[/tpl] The name "Cirripedia" is Latin, meaning "curl-footed".

An evaluation function, also known as a heuristic evaluation function or static evaluation function, is a function used by game-playing programs to estimate the value or goodness of a position in the minimax and related algorithms. The evaluation function is typically designed to prioritize speed over accuracy; the function looks only at the current position and does not explore possible moves (therefore static).

[[Tertium quid]]

CATEGORIES: Latin legal terms, Ancient Christian controversies

Tertium quid refers to an unidentified third element that is in combination with two known ones."Tertium quid", Online Etymological Dictionary The phrase is associated with alchemy. It is Latin for "third thing", a translation of the Greek tríton ti (τρίτον τι). The Greek phrase was used by Plato (360 BC),Grote, George, Plato, and the other companions of Sokrates, Volume 2, p. 418. From the dialogue Sophist: "Existence or reality must therefore be a tertium quid, apart from motion and rest, not the sum total of those two items." and by Irenæus (c. AD 196).[ref]Irenæus, Against Heresies 2.1.3. The surviving text is Latin, but the original would have been in Greek. "But if they
say this, there will be a 'tertium quid,' with this immense separation between the Pleroma and what is outside it, and this 'tertium quid' will limit and contain the other two, and will be greater than both the Pleroma and what is outside it, since it contains both in its bosom." (Grant, Robert McQueen, Irenaeus of Lyons, p. 108.)[/ref] The earliest Latin example is by Tertullian (c. 220), who used the phrase to describe a mixed substance with composite properties such as electrum, a somewhat different sense than the modern meaning.Tertullian, Adv. Praxean 27. "If, however, it was only a tertium quid, some composite essence formed out of the two substances, like the electrum (which we have mentioned), there would be no distinct proofs apparent of either nature." (That is, of the divine and human natures of Christ.)

[[Council–manager government]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of government, Local government in the United States, Local government in the Republic of Ireland

The  council–manager government form is one of two predominant forms of local government in the United States; the other common form of local government is the mayor–council government form, which characteristically occurs in large cities.Svara, James H. (2008). Strengthening Local Government Leadership and Performance: Reexamining and Updating the Winter Commission Goals. Public Administration Review, December 2008, Special Issue, vol 68, pp S37–S49. Council–manager government form also is used in county governments in the United States and the governing body in a county may be called a council, a commission, freeholders, aldermen, and such. The council–manager form also is used for municipal government in Canada and in Ireland, among many other countries, both for city councils and county councils.
Under the council–manager form of government for municipalities, the elected governing body (commonly called a city council, city commission, board of aldermen or board of selectmen) is responsible for the legislative function of the municipality such as establishing policy, passing local ordinances, voting appropriations, and developing an overall vision.ICMA information brochure County and other types of local government follow the same pattern, with a different title for the governing body members that matches the title of the body.
The legislative body, which is voted into office by public elections, appoints a professional manager to oversee the administrative operations, implement its policies, and advise it. The position of "mayor" present in this type of legislative body is a largely ceremonial title, and may be selected by the council from among its members or elected as an at-large council member with no executive functions.ICMA forms of government
The city manager position in this form of municipal government is similar to that of corporate chief executive officer (CEO),  providing professional management to the board of directors. Council–manager government is much like a publicly traded corporation.Local Government Management, ICMA In a corporation, the board of directors appoints a CEO, makes major decisions and wields representative power on behalf of shareholders. In council–manager government, the elected council appoints a city manager, makes major decisions, and wields representative power on behalf of the citizens.  The city manager is, in turn, responsible for hiring a city staff to carry out implementation of city ordinances.  
This system of government is used in 40.1% of American cities with populations of 2,500 or more, according to the 2011 Municipal Yearbook published by the International City/County Management Association (ICMA),2011 Municipal Yearbook a professional organization for city managers and other top appointed local government administrators/CAOs.

A city manager is an official appointed as the administrative manager of a city, in a council-manager form of city government. Local officials serving in this position are sometimes referred to as the chief executive officer (CEO) or chief administrative officer (CAO) in some municipalities.City of Naperville However, in a technical sense, the term "city manager," as opposed to CAO, implies more discretion and independent authority that is set forth in a charter or some other body of codified law, as opposed to duties being assigned on a varying basis by a single superior such as a mayor.Svara, James H. and Kimberly L.

In Abrahamic religions, Gabriel ([tpl]Hebrew Name|גַּבְרִיאֵל|Gavri'el|Gaḇrîʼēl, God is my strength[/tpl]; Arabic: جبريل, Jibrīl or جبرائيل Jibrāʾīl) is an angel who typically serves as a messenger sent from God to certain people.
In the Bible, Gabriel is mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments. In the Old Testament, he appeared to the prophet Daniel, delivering explanations of Daniel's visions (Daniel 8:15–26, 9:21–27). In the Gospel of Luke, Gabriel appeared to Zecharias, and to the virgin Mary foretelling the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively (Luke 1:11–38). In the Book of Daniel, he is referred to as "the man Gabriel", while in the Gospel of Luke, Gabriel is referred to as "an angel of the Lord" (Luke 1:11). Gabriel is not called an archangel in the Bible, but is so called in Intertestamental period sources like the Book of Enoch. In the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches, the archangels Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel are also referred to as saints.[tpl]cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Julie|title=Friar Jack's Catechism Quiz: Test Your Knowledge on Angels|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/e-News/FriarJack/fj082102.asp |publisher=AmericanCatholic.org |accessdate=16 February 2012[/tpl]

[[Ayah]]

CATEGORIES: Ayat, Arrangement of the Quran

Ayah (or Aayah; [tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]large|آية[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|āyah[/tpl], plural: ayat (ayaat) [tpl]lang|ar|[tpl]large|آيات[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|āyāt[/tpl]) means "evidence" or "sign". In the context of Islam's principal scripture, the Qur'an, ayah is used to mean "verse", i.e. each statement or paragraph marked by a number.
Although meaning "verse" when using the Qur'an, it is doubtful whether "ayah" means anything other than "sign" or "remarkable event" in the Qur'an's text. The "signs" refer to various phenomena, ranging from the universe, its creation, the alternation between day and night, rainfall, the life and growth plants, etc. Other references are to miracles or to the rewards of belief and the fate of unbelievers.[tpl]cite book |last=Campo |first=Juan E. |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |year=2009 |publisher=Facts On File |location=New York |isbn=9780816054541 |pages=77[/tpl] For example:
Chapters in the Quran consist of several verses, varying in number from 3 to 286. Within a long chapter, the verses may be further grouped into thematic sequences or passages.
For the purpose of interpretation, the verses are separated into two groups: those that are clear and unambiguous (muhkam) and those that are allegorical (mutashabeh).The Ayahs of the Quran: The Muhkam and the Mutashabih (Association of Islamic Charitable Projects). This distinction is based on the Quran itself: "It is God Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are 'clear', they are the foundation of the Book. Others are 'allegorical' but those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except God. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: We believe in the Book, the whole of it is from our Lord. And none will grasp the Message except men of understanding.""Ali-Imran 3:7 from the Yusuf Ali translation of the Quran online at the Quranic Arabic Corpus.
The word ayah is also used to refer to the verses of the Bible by Arab Christians and Christians in countries where Arabic words are used for religious terms.For example, [tpl]cite web |title='Yesus' Siapakah Dia? |url=http://www.kabarindonesia.com/berita.php?pil=19&dn=20070103185551 |work=KabarIndonesia |accessdate=21 July 2011 |language=Indonesian |quote=...Kejadian 1:26.

A common myth persists that the number of verses in the Quran is 6,666.[tpl]cite book |last=Hixon |first=Lex |title=The heart of the Qurʼan : an introduction to Islamic spirituality |year=2003 |publisher=Quest |isbn=9780835608220 |edition=2. ed.[/tpl] In fact, the total number of verses in all chapters is 6,236, although this varies depending on how (or if) the Basmala appearing at the start of each chapter are counted.

Luke Rhinehart (born George Cockcroft November 15, 1932) is an American writer, most notable as the author of The Dice Man, a 1971 novel about a psychotherapist who casts dice in place of making decisions.
Much of Rhinehart's writing follows the style of The Dice Man. His unreliable narrator switches rapidly between first- and third-person perspectives, interrupting narrative flow with epistolary items from fictional sources. He gives the impression of a larger story, of which just a glimpse is seen.http://hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/luke-rhinehart/
The genre of a Rhinehart novel is also unreliable, often varying between chapters. A single book might contain sections of thriller, erotica, comedy, romance, philosophy, and detective.http://www.amazon.com/The-Dice-Man-Luke-Rhinehart/dp/0879518642

[[Off-budget enterprise]]
CATEGORIES: Government budgets, Types of business entity, Government bodies

Off-budget enterprises (OBEs,  or special districts) are a type of government in the United States, the UK and the EU. OBEs use public funds to further public (as in education) or private (as in economic revitalization) interests. Regulated by various state and federal laws, they operate outside the regulations for general-purpose government and public scrutiny, although many states have created oversight authorities of one form or another. They achieve self-funding by usually having taxation authority or fund themselves through fees for services rendered. Some have the ability to raise revenue bonds. The fastest-growing OBE is the industrial development agency which issues tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds to finance private business ventures mainly to revitalize economically depressed areas. Many are formed to deal with special local situations. The most common OBE is the School district.
In 1962 there were 18,323 OBEs and in 1998 there were nearly 30,000. Some OBEs receive funding from the federal government in the form of block grants.

George Iain Duncan Smith (born 9 April 1954), often referred to by his initials IDS, is a British Conservative Party politician who is the current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. He was previously the Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003. He was first elected to Parliament in 1992 as the MP for Chingford, and he has represented its successor constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green since 1997.
Duncan Smith was born in Edinburgh and served in the Scots Guards from 1975 to 1981, seeing tours in Northern Ireland and Rhodesia. He joined the Conservative Party in 1981, and was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1992. Duncan Smith succeeded William Hague as Conservative Leader in 2001, winning the leadership election partly on the support of Margaret Thatcher for his Eurosceptic ideology. Duncan Smith was the first Roman Catholic to serve as a Conservative Leader, and the first to be born in Scotland since Arthur Balfour. In 2010, "The Tablet" named him one of Britain’s most influential Roman Catholics.[tpl]cite web|title=The Tablet's Top 100|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/pdf/4283/[/tpl]
His time as Conservative Leader saw his party fall in opinion polls, and many Conservative MPs came to consider him incapable of winning an election. In 2003 his MPs passed a vote of no confidence in his leadership; he immediately resigned, and was succeeded by Michael Howard. As a backbencher, he founded the centre-right Centre for Social Justice, a think tank independent of the Conservative Party, and became a published novelist, though his novel The Devil's Tune received heavily critical reviews. On 12 May 2010, Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Duncan Smith to serve in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.

Sex change is a process by which a person or animal changes sex – that is, by which female sexual characteristics are substituted for male ones, or vice versa. Sex change may occur naturally, as in the case of the sequential hermaphroditism observed in some species. Most commonly, however, the term is used for sex reassignment therapy, including sex reassignment surgery, carried out on humans. It is also sometimes used for the medical procedures applied to intersexual people. The term may also be applied to the broader process of changing gender role ("living as a woman" instead of living as a man, or vice versa), including but not necessarily limited to medical procedures.

It is worth noting that UNWTO measures tourism income differently and in its Tourism Highlights report, 2010 edition, places Spain ($53 billion) second only to US ($93.9 billion) in 2009 for "International Tourism Receipts". The UNWTO's own methodological notes explain the meaning of International Tourism Receipts and may help to explain the differences in the two organizations figures.

CATEGORIES: Puzzles

A brain teaser is a form of puzzle that requires thought to solve. It often requires thinking in unconventional ways with given constraints in mind; sometimes it also involves lateral thinking. Logic puzzles and riddles are specific types of brain teasers.
One of the earliest known brain teaser enthusiasts was the Greek mathematician Archimedes.[tpl]cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Editors of Time-Life books, Inc. |title=The Puzzle Master |year=1989 |publisher=Time-Life Books |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |isbn=0-8097-0928-7 |pages=18[/tpl] He devised mathematical problems for his contemporaries to solve.

[[Dagor Dagorath]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth battles, Eschatology, Middle-earth theology

The Dagor Dagorath (Sindarin for Battle of Battles) is a fictional battle described in the legendarium of J. R. R. Tolkien. As Tolkien's works were conceived as a fictional "forgotten history" of the world, the Dagor Dagorath represents the coming End of the World, and is often referred to as simply "The End". As Tolkien originally wrote it, The Silmarillion ends with a prophecy by Mandos about the end of the world. The published Silmarillion ends instead with the last paragraph of Valaquenta. This was due to the fact that Tolkien had abandoned the idea of the "second prophecy of Mandos", and the Valaquenta text, much later, contradicted it openly. However, references to the final battle remain in the published Silmarillion, such as a statement at the end of the Akallabêth that Ar-Pharazôn and his mortal warriors who had set foot on Aman were buried by falling hills, imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten until the "Last Battle and Day of Doom". Christopher TolkienJ.R.R. Tolkien, The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún, Commentary on the lay of the Völsungs p 185 sees the account as similar to the Nordic legend of Ragnarök and J. R. R. Tolkien also made this connection in some of his letters.

In mathematics, a diffeology on a set  declares what the smooth parametrizations in the set are. In some sense a diffeology generalizes the concept of smooth charts in a differentiable manifold. 
The concept was first introduced by Jean-Marie Souriau in the 1980s and developed first by his students Paul Donato (homogeneous spaces and coverings) and Patrick Iglesias (diffeological fiber bundles, higher homotopy etc.), later by other people. A related idea was introduced by Kuo-Tsaï Chen (陳國才, Chen Guocai) in the 1970s, using convex sets instead of open sets for the domains of the plots.

As Europe's oldest kingdom and the home of Hans Christian Andersen, Denmark is often marketed as a "fairytale country".

[[Link-state routing protocol]]

CATEGORIES: Routing protocols, Routing algorithms

A link-state routing protocol is one of the two main classes of routing protocols used in packet switching networks for computer communications (the other is the distance-vector routing protocol). Examples of link-state routing protocols include open shortest path first (OSPF) and intermediate system to intermediate system (IS-IS).
The link-state protocol is performed by every switching node in the network (i.e., nodes that are prepared to forward packets; in the Internet, these are called routers). The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs a map of the connectivity to the network, in the form of a graph, showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes. Each node then independently calculates the next best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network. The collection of best paths will then form the node's routing table.
This contrasts with distance-vector routing protocols, which work by having each node share its routing table with its neighbours. In a link-state protocol the only information passed between nodes is connectivity related.
Link-state algorithms are sometimes characterized informally as each router 'telling the world about its neighbours'.

The city has a complex recorded history, partially due to the combined regional importance of the Port of Klaipėda, a usually ice-free port on the Baltic Sea, and the Akmena – Danė River. It has been controlled by the Teutonic Knights, the Duchy of Prussia, the Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire, the Entente States immediately after World War I, Lithuania as a result of the 1923 Klaipėda Revolt, and the Third Reich following the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania. The city was incorporated into Lithuania during its tenure as a Soviet Socialist Republic and has remained within Lithuania following its re-establishment as an independent state.
The population shrank from 207,100 in 1992 to 157,350 in 2014. Popular seaside resorts found close to Klaipėda are Nida to the south on the Curonian Spit, and Palanga to the north.

INS was established on June 10, 1933, by a[tpl]clarify|date=October 2012[/tpl] merger to administer matters related to established immigration and naturalization policy.  After 1890, the Federal government, rather than the individual states, regulated immigration into the United States,Ellis Island, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior and the Immigration Act of 1891 established a Commissioner of Immigration in the Treasury Department.  Over the years, these matters were later transferred to the purview of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor after 1903, the Department of Labor after 1913, and the Department of Justice after 1940.
In 2003 the administration of immigration services, including permanent residence, naturalization, asylum, and other functions became the responsibility of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), which existed only for a short time before changing to its current name, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The investigative and enforcement functions (including investigations, deportation, and intelligence) were combined with INS and U.S. Customs investigators, the Federal Protective Service, and the Federal Air Marshal Service, to create U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The border functions of the INS, which included the Border Patrol along with INS Inspectors, were combined with U.S. Customs Inspectors into the newly created U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

[[Western astrology]]

CATEGORIES: Western astrology, Astrology by tradition, History of astrology

Western astrology is the system of astrology most popular in Western countries. Western astrology is historically based on  Ptolemy's  Tetrabiblos (2nd century AD), which in turn was a continuation of  Hellenistic and ultimately Babylonian traditions.
Western astrology is largely horoscopic, that is, it is a form of divination based on the construction of a horoscope for an exact moment, such as a person's birth, in which various cosmic bodies are said to have an influence.
Astrology in western popular culture is often reduced to sun sign astrology, which considers only the individual's date of birth (i.e. the "position of the Sun" at that date).

Slash's Snakepit was an American rock supergroup from Los Angeles, California, formed by then-Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash in 1993. Though often described as a solo or side project, Slash stated that Snakepit was a band, with equal contributions by all members. The first lineup of the band consisted of Slash, two of his Guns N' Roses band mates—drummer Matt Sorum and guitarist Gilby Clarke—as well as Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez  and former Jellyfish live guitarist Eric Dover on lead vocals.
Their debut album, It's Five O'Clock Somewhere, was released in 1995. For the supporting tour, Slash enlisted James LoMenzo and Brian Tichy, of Pride and Glory, in place of Inez and Sorum who had other commitments. They played shows in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia before Geffen Records pulled their financial support for the tour, with Slash returning to Guns N' Roses and Slash's Snakepit disbanding.
Following his departure from Guns N' Roses in 1996, Slash formed the cover band Slash's Blues Ball. After a tour in 1997, Slash approached Blues Ball bassist Johnny Griparic about forming a new lineup of Slash's Snakepit. The new lineup consisted of Slash, Griparic, singer Rod Jackson, guitarist Ryan Roxie and drummer Matt Laug (Roxie and Laug were both former members of Alice Cooper's solo band). They recorded and released their second album entitled Ain't Life Grand in 2000, which was preceded by a tour supporting AC/DC and followed by their own headlining tour. For the tour, Keri Kelli joined the group in place of Ryan Roxie, who departed following the completion of the album. However, after the final show, Slash disbanded Slash's Snakepit due to a lack of commitment from his band members.

The war was the contention over the territorial inheritances {–}the division of the unified lands of Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire between his grandsons, the three surviving sons of Louis the Pious. Despite provisions by Louis the Pious, war broke out between his sons and nephews. It was a defeat for the allied forces of Lothair I of Italy and Pepin II of Aquitaine and a victory for Charles the Bald and Louis the German. While hostilities continued until another two years into 843, the Treaty of Verdun ending the war shaped and influences history in Europe even to this late modern date.

Lothair I or Lothar I (German: Lothar, French: Lothaire, Italian: Lotario, Dutch: Lotharius) (795 – 29 September 855) was the Emperor of the Romans (817–855), co-ruling with his father until 840, and the King of Bavaria (815–817), Italy (818–855) and Middle Francia (840–855). The territory of Lorraine (Lothringen in German) is named after him.
Lothair was the eldest son of the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious and his wife Ermengarde of Hesbaye,[tpl]EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Lothair I.[/tpl] daughter of Ingerman the duke of Hesbaye. On several occasions, Lothair led his full-brothers Pippin I of Aquitaine and Louis the German in revolt against their father to protest against attempts to make their half-brother Charles the Bald a co-heir to the Frankish domains. Upon the father's death, Charles and Louis joined forces against Lothair in a three-year civil war (840–843). The struggles between the brothers led directly to the breakup of the Frankish Empire assembled by their grandfather Charlemagne, and laid the foundation for the development of modern France and Germany.

[[Polynomial-time reduction]]
CATEGORIES: Computational complexity theory

In computational complexity theory, a polynomial-time reduction is a method of solving one problem by means of a hypothetical subroutine for solving a different problem (that is, a reduction), that uses polynomial time excluding the time within the subroutine. There are several different types of polynomial-time reduction, depending on the details of how the subroutine is used. Intuitively, a polynomial-time reduction proves that the first problem is no more difficult than the second one, because whenever an efficient algorithm exists for the second problem, one exists for the first problem as well. Polynomial-time reductions are frequently used in complexity theory for defining both complexity classes and complete problems for those classes.

CATEGORIES: Breads, Twice-baked goods

Melba toast is a dry, crisp and thinly sliced toast, often served with soup and salad or topped with either melted cheese or pâté. It is named after Dame Nellie Melba, the stage name of Australian opera singer Helen Porter Mitchell. Its name is thought to date from 1897, when the singer was very ill and it became a staple of her diet.History of Melba Toast The toast was created for her by chef and fan Auguste Escoffier, who also created the Peach Melba dessert for her. The hotel proprietor César Ritz supposedly named it in a conversation with Escoffier.[ref]
</ref>
Melba toast is made by lightly toasting slices of bread under a grill, on both sides. The resulting toast is then sliced laterally. The thin slices are then returned to the grill with the untoasted sides towards the heat source, resulting in toast half the normal thickness.Great British Cookbook – Melba Toast Thus, it can be described as a twice-baked food (see under rusk).
Melba toast is also available commercially, and was at one time given to infants who were teething as a hard food substance on which to chew.
In 1925, the Mayo Brothers prescribed the "Eighteen Day Reducing Diet" to Ethel Barrymore. It included Melba toast, which made the toast very popular at the time. Melba toast can also be used to make stuffing or dressing.

Mathematical practice is used to distinguish the working practices of professional mathematicians (e.g. selecting theorems to prove, using informal notations to persuade themselves and others that various steps in the final proof can be formalised, and seeking peer review and publication) from the end result of proven and published theorems.

Vuk Branković ([tpl]lang-sr-cyr|Вук Бранковић[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sh|ʋûːk brǎːnkoʋit͡ɕ|pron[/tpl]) (born 1345 - died October 6, 1397) was a Serbian medieval nobleman who during the Fall of the Serbian Empire inherited a province in present day south and southwestern Serbia, the northern part of present day Macedonia and northern Montenegro. His fief (and later state) was known as Oblast Brankovića (District of Branković) or simply as Vukova zemlja (Vuk's land) which he held with the title of gospodin (lord, sir), under Prince Lazar of Serbia. After the Battle of Kosovo Vuk was briefly de facto most powerful Serbian lord.

[[Quasi-empirical method]]

CATEGORIES: Scientific method, Philosophy of science, Philosophy of mathematics, Thought experiments

Quasi-empirical methods are applied in science and in mathematics.  The term "empirical methods" refers to experiment, disclosure of apparatus for reproduction of experiments, and other ways in which science is validated by scientists.  Empirical methods are studied extensively in the philosophy of science but cannot be used directly in fields whose hypotheses are not invalidated by real experiment (mathematics, theology, ideology).  In these fields, the prefix 'quasi' came to denote methods that are "almost" or "socially approximate" an ideal of truly empirical methods.
It is unnecessary to find all counterexamples to a theory; all that is required to disprove a theory logically is one counterexample. The converse does not prove a theory; Bayesian inference simply makes a theory more likely, by weight of evidence.
One can argue that no science is capable of finding all counter-examples to a theory, therefore, no science is strictly empirical, it's all quasi-empirical. But usually, the term "quasi-empirical" refers to the means of choosing problems to focus on (or ignore), selecting prior work on which to build an argument or proof, notations for informal claims, peer review and acceptance, and incentives to discover, ignore, or correct errors.  These are common to both science and mathematics, and do not include experimental method.
Albert Einstein's discovery of the general relativity theory relied upon thought experiments and mathematics. Empirical methods only became relevant when confirmation was sought. Furthermore, some empirical confirmation was found only some time after the general acceptance of the theory.
Thought experiments are almost standard procedure in philosophy, where a conjecture is tested out in the imagination for possible effects on experience; when these are thought to be implausible,  unlikely to occur, or not actually occurring, then the conjecture may be either rejected or amended.  Logical positivism was a perhaps extreme version of this practice, though this claim is open to debate.
Post-20th-century philosophy of mathematics is mostly concerned with quasi-empirical methods especially as reflected in actual mathematical practice of working mathematicians.

[[Miloš Obilić]]

Miloš Obilić ([tpl]lang-sr-cyr|Милош Обилић[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sh|mîloʃ ôbilit͡ɕ|pron[/tpl]; died 1389) was a medieval Serbian knight in the service of Prince Lazar, during the invasion of the Ottoman Empire. He is not mentioned in contemporary sources, but he features prominently in later accounts of the Serbian defeat at the Battle of Kosovo as the legendary assassin of the Ottoman sultan Murad I. Although he remains anonymous in the extant sources until the 18th century, the dissemination of the story of Murad's assassination in Florentine, Serbian, Ottoman and Greek sources suggests that versions of it circulated widely across the Balkans within half a century after the event.
It is not certain whether Obilić actually existed, but Lazar's family - strengthening their political control - "gave birth to the myth of Kosovo", including the story of Obilić.[tpl]cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7|page=32[/tpl] He became a major figure in Serbian epic poetry, in which he is elevated to the level of the most noble national hero of medieval Serbian folklore. Along with the martyrdom of Prince Lazar and the alleged treachery of Vuk Branković, Miloš's deed became an integral part of Serbian traditions surrounding the Battle of Kosovo. In the 19th century, Miloš also came to be venerated as a Saint in the Serbian Church.

[[Muscular system]]
CATEGORIES: Muscular system

The muscular system is an organ system consisting of skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles. It permits movement of the body, maintains posture, and circulates blood throughout the body. The muscular system in vertebrates is controlled through the nervous system, although some muscles (such as the cardiac muscle) can be completely autonomous. Together with the skeletal system it forms the musculoskeletal system, which is responsible for movement of the human body. [tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

[[Benign fasciculation syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Neurological disorders, Ailments of unknown etiology

Benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) is a neurological disorder characterized by fasciculation (twitching) of various voluntary muscles in the body.  The twitching can occur in any voluntary muscle group but is most common in the eyelids, arms, legs, and feet.  Even the tongue may be affected. The twitching may be occasional or may go on nearly continuously. Usually intentional movement of the involved muscle causes the fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again.

[[Jacobus van Meteren]]
CATEGORIES: 1519 births, Year of death missing, Dutch publishers (people), People from Breda

Sir Jacobus van Meteren (born 1519) was the financier and printer of early English versions of the Bible. He was involved in the printing of an edition of Tyndale's New Testament in 1535 (Herbert #15). The Coverdale Bible of 1535 (Herbert #18) may also have been his work. He may also have printed the Matthew Bible of 1537 (Herbert #34), the combined work of William Tyndale, Myles Coverdale and John Rogers. It is unknown if he was the only financier, printer or publisher of these works, or one of several.
He was born at Breda, but there has been some debate over the details of his life, which the following quote from the entry "Bible, English" in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica illustrates:
Since the discovery of Guido Latré in 1997, it is believed that Emanuel van Meteren's affidavit of 1609 refers to the printing of the Coverdale Bible in 1535, when his father employed Myles Coverdale as translator.Guido Latre, The 1535 Coverdale Bible an its Antwerp Origins,, in The Bible as Book: The Reformation, ed. by O'Sullivan, Orlaith (The British Library & Oak Knoll Press in association with The Scriptorium: Center for Christian Antiquities London & New Castle, Delaware 2000), pp. 89-102.ISBN 9781584560258, ISBN 1-58456-025-8 It could also refer to the Matthew Bible of 1537. The names of Grafton and Whitchurch are associated with the Matthew Bible, not the Coverdale Bible.
Rogers married J. van Meteren's niece, Adriana de Weyden, the same year that the Matthew Bible was published. If J. van Meteren was the printer of the Coverdale Bible, he would readily have been able to provide Rogers with Coverdale's prior work covering those books of the Old Testament which Tyndale had not had time to translate.

[[Core ontology]]

CATEGORIES: Ontology, Lexicography

In philosophy, a core ontology is a basic and minimal ontology consisting only of the minimal concepts required to understand the other concepts. It must be based on a core glossary in some human language so humans can comprehend the concepts and distinctions made.  Each natural language tends to rely on its own conceptual metaphor structure, and so tends to have its own core ontology (according to W. V. Quine).  It could be said also to represent the moral core of a human linguistic culture, and to self-correct so as to better represent core cultural ideas.
Such a core ontology is a key pre-requisite to a more complete foundation ontology, or a more general philosophical sense of ontology.  Most applicable to teaching, e.g. the Longmans defining dictionary of the simplest meanings of 2,000 English words is used to define the 4,000 most basic English idioms -- this is a core glossary of the English language, which permits access to the core ontology (the idioms).
Core ontologies is a concept that is used in information science as well. For example CIDOC-CRM and CORA are considered as core ontologies.

CATEGORIES: True seals, Fauna of Siberia, Lake Baikal, Endemic fauna of Russia

The Baikal seal, Lake Baikal seal, or nerpa (Pusa sibirica, syn. Phoca sibirica), is a species of earless seal endemic to Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia. Like the Caspian seal, it is related to the Arctic ringed seal. The Baikal seal is one of the smallest true seals and the only exclusively freshwater pinniped species.Randall R. Reeves, Brent S. Stewart, Phillip J. clapham, James A. Powell, "National Audubon Society Guide to the Marine Mammals of the World", Alfred A. Knopf publishing, New York, 2002 A subpopulation of inland harbour seals living in the Hudson Bay region of Quebec, Canada (lac de loups marins harbour seals), the Saimaa ringed seal (a ringed seal subspecies) and the Ladoga seal (a ringed seal subspecies) are found in freshwater, but these are part of species that also have marine populations.
It remains a scientific mystery how the seals originally came to Lake Baikal, hundreds of kilometers from any ocean. Some scientists speculate the seals arrived at Lake Baikal when a sea-passage linked the lake with the Arctic Ocean (see also West Siberian Glacial Lake and West Siberian Plain).
The most recent population estimates are at 80,000-100,000 animals, roughly equalling the expected carrying capacity of the lake. At present the species is not considered threatened, despite hunting (both legal and illegal) and heavy pollution of the lake. The most serious future threat may be global warming, which has the potential to seriously affect a closed cold-water ecosystem such as Lake Baikal.

[[Yawl]]

CATEGORIES: Yawls, Ship types, Fishing vessels, Sailing rigs and rigging, Traditional boats

A yawl (from Dutch jol) is a two-masted sailing craft similar to a sloop or cutter but with an additional mast (mizzenmast or mizzen mast) located well aft of the main mast, often right on the transom, or aft of the rudder post if the vessel has an inboard hung rudder. (A vessel with a larger mizzen located in a more forward position is called a ketch; see below: Yawl versus ketch.) The mizzen sail (smaller than the mainsail) is hoisted on the mizzen mast.
The yawl was originally developed as a rig for commercial fishing boats, one good example of this being the Salcombe Yawl (a small traditional fishing boat built in Devon). In its heyday, the rig was particularly popular with single-handed sailors, such as circumnavigators Harry Pidgeon and Francis Chichester. This was due to the ability of a yawl to be trimmed to sail without rudder input. Modern self-steering and navigation aids have made this less important, and the yawl has generally fallen out of favor.
In the 1950s and 60s, yawls were developed for ocean racing, to take advantage of the handicapping rule that did not penalize them for flying a mizzen staysail, which on long ocean races, often downwind, were a great advantage. A good example of this was Olin Stephens' Finisterre.

[[Emanuel van Meteren]]

Emanuel van Meteren or Meteeren (6 September 1535 – 11 April 1612) was a Flemish historian and Consul for "the Traders of the Low Countries" in London.  He was born  in Antwerp, the son of Sir Jacobus van Meteren, Dutch financier and publisher of early English versions of the Bible, and Orrilia Ortellius, of the famous Ortellius family of mapmakers, and nephew of the cartographer Abraham Ortelius.
As a historian Van Meteren was special in that he was not merely a chronicler of the events of his time, but also a powerful and wealthy man who influenced those events:[tpl]sfn|Harkness|2007[/tpl]
 The van Meteren family...had fled the Netherlands for religious reasons. Van Meteren’s father, Jacob, played a key role in the publication of the first English Bible in the 1530s, and the family established itself as a pillar of the Protestant refugee community in London. As an adult, Emmanuel lived on Lime Street, became the consul for the Dutch merchants in London, and occupied the all-important office of postmaster. Reliable mail service was an essential component of any natural history network, since specimens ranging from tulip bulbs to rhinoceros horns needed to circulate between interested naturalists. Accompanying these specimens, of course, were the letters on which the European natural history community in particular, and the Republic of Letters more generally, depended in order to thrive...Van Meteren’s skillful management of the post...made him indispensable.  When the artist Marcus Gheeraerts wanted to send smoked herring to Antwerp, or Ortelius wanted gifts to arrive at his sister’s house in London, they inevitably went through Emmanuel van Meteren and his formidable network of middlemen, merchants, sailors, and travelers to ensure that precious messages and gifts reached their destination. 
In 1581 he was the Consul representing Dutch merchants in London. In that year he harbored Christiaen, the fourth secretary of William the Silent, Prince of Orange, while he was being pursued by enraged Spaniards.  He related the surrounding events in his work Album.
To help thwart the plots of the Spanish Ambassador at the Court of Queen Elizabeth, William the Silent enlisted one Willem Janszoon van Hoorn, the captain of the Sea Beggar, to pretend to accept a bribe from the Spanish Ambassador and enter into a conspiracy to surprise the English garrison at Flushing. To avoid trickery Don Bernardino de Mendoza had insisted on having the captain's small son as a hostage. Since trickery was indeed intended, the captain was desperate as to what might befall his son. The Prince of Orange promised him on his word of honour that he would have the boy kidnapped from the Spanish Embassy in London and safely conveyed home. Christiaen (later called "The Elder") was commissioned to redeem at all costs the Stadtholder's given pledge. Van Meteren made some arrangements with the Secretary of State, Sir Francis Walsingham, who was in charge of security for the embassy. Nevertheless Christiaen and the boy narrowly escaped the pursuit of the enraged Spaniards who scoured the banks of the Thames for him and the boy. Van Meteren was successful in concealing them and effecting their escape.
In 1599 van Meteren wrote a book titled Belgische ofte Nederlandsche Historie van onzen Tijden, detailing the events of the first part of the Eighty Years' War between the Netherlands and Spain. Some of the accounts detail events that van Meteren actually witnessed. For instance he was with the Prince of Orange during the siege of Zaltbommel by the Spaniards.
After Henry Hudson returned from his second voyage he related to van Meteren that there had been a mutiny in 1609, originating in quarrels between Dutch and English sailors.  Van Meteren had access to Hudson's journals, charts and logbooks, and recorded these events in Historie der Nederlanden.
He also chronicled the adventures and demise of the French merchant François Le Fort.
Van Meteren is also the author of Historia Belgica.

CATEGORIES: Submarine classes, Upholder/Victoria-class submarines

The ''Upholder/Victoria''-class submarines, also known as the Type 2400 (due to their displacement of 2,400 tonnes), are diesel-electric Fleet submarines designed in the UK in the late 1970s to supplement the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine force.
They were decommissioned with the end of the Cold War after a short length of service in the Royal Navy. In 1998, Canada purchased the submarines and a suite of trainers from the Royal Navy to replace the decommissioned Oberon class of submarines.

[[Party discipline]]
CATEGORIES: Political terminology, Political concepts

Party discipline is the ability of a parliamentary group of a political party to get its members to support the policies of their party leadership. In liberal democracies, it usually refers to the control that party leaders have over their caucus members in the legislature. Party discipline is important for all systems of government that allow parties to hold political power because it determines the degree to which the governmental infrastructure will be affected by legitimate political processes.  
The term has a somewhat different meaning in Marxist-Leninist political systems such as the People's Republic of China.  In this case it refers to administrative sanctions such as fines or expulsion that the Communist Party can impose on its members for actions such as corruption or disagreeing with the party.
Breaking party discipline in parliamentary votes can result in a number of penalties for the member who dissents, These penalties include not being promoted to a cabinet position, and losing other perks of elected office like travel. Their disagreement with their party caucus may be so strong that they leave the party to join another parliamentary caucus or become an independent. This is known as crossing the floor.

New France ([tpl]lang-fr|Nouvelle-France[/tpl]) was the area colonized by France in North America during a period beginning with the exploration of the Saint Lawrence River by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Spain and Great Britain in 1763. At its peak in 1712 (before the Treaty of Utrecht), the territory of New France, also sometimes known as the French North American Empire or Royal New France, extended from Newfoundland to the Rocky Mountains and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico.Control and Order in French Colonial Louisbourg, 1713–1758, Andrew John Bayly Johnston, 2001, MSU Press pp. 8–9 http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_France&action=edit
The territory was then divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: Canada, Acadia, Hudson Bay, Newfoundland (Plaisance),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/french.html |title=The French Settlement of Placentia: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage |publisher=Heritage Canada |accessdate=2010-06-30[/tpl] and Louisiana. The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) as the successor to Acadia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fortressoflouisbourg.ca/ArchaeologyE/SiteInformation.html#HistoryFortress |title=Archaeology Program 2010 |publisher=Fortressoflouisbourg.ca |accessdate=2010-06-30[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
France ceded the rest of New France, except the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, to Great Britain and Spain at the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Seven Years' War (the French and Indian War). Britain received the lands east of the Mississippi River that lay between the Thirteen Colonies and Louisiana, which included Canada, Acadia, and parts of Louisiana, while Spain received the territory to the west – the larger portion of Louisiana. Spain returned its portion of Louisiana to France in 1800 under the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso, but French leader Napoleon Bonaparte sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, permanently ending French colonial efforts on the North American mainland.

[[Fusional language]]
CATEGORIES: Fusional languages, Synthetic languages

A fusional language (also called inflecting language) is a type of synthetic language, distinguished from agglutinative languages by its tendency to overlay many morphemes to denote grammatical, syntactic or semantic change.
Examples of fusional Indo-European languages are: Sanskrit (and the modern Indo-Aryan languages), Greek (classical and modern), Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, German, Icelandic, Polish, Croatian,  Serbian, Slovak, Ukrainian, and Czech. Another notable group of fusional languages is the Semitic languages group. A high degree of fusion is also found in many Sami languages, such as Skolt Sami.
An illustration of fusionality is the Latin word [tpl]lang|la|bonus[/tpl] ("good"). The ending [tpl]lang|la|-us[/tpl] denotes masculine gender, nominative case, and singular number. Changing any one of these features requires replacing the suffix [tpl]lang|la|-us[/tpl] with a different one. In the form [tpl]lang|la|bonum[/tpl], the ending [tpl]lang|la|-um[/tpl] denotes either masculine accusative singular, neuter accusative singular, or neuter nominative singular.

[[Chinese Indonesians]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups in Indonesia, Chinese diaspora by country, Indonesian people of Chinese descent, Ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, Chinese Indonesian culture

Chinese Indonesians or Tionghoa, previously known as the Indonesian Chinese, are Indonesians descended from various Chinese ethnic groups, particularly Han. This migration was done both directly and through Maritime Southeast Asia. Their population grew rapidly during the colonial period when workers were contracted from their home provinces in southern China. Indonesia's 2010 census reported more than 2.8 million self-identified ethnic Chinese: 1.20 percent of the country's population.
Under the Dutch ethnic classification policy, Chinese Indonesians were considered "foreign orientals"; as such, they struggled to enter the colonial and national sociopolitical scene, despite successes in their economic endeavors. Evidence of discrimination against Chinese Indonesians can be found throughout the history of Indonesia, although government policies implemented since 1998 have attempted to redress this. Resentment of ethnic Chinese economic aptitude grew in the 1950s as native Indonesian merchants felt they could not remain competitive. In some cases, government action only propagated the stereotype that ethnic Chinese-owned conglomerates were corrupt. Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis severely disrupted their business activities, reform of government policy and legislation removed a number of political and social restrictions on Chinese Indonesians.
The development of local Chinese society and culture is based upon three pillars: clan associations, ethnic media, and Chinese language schools.[tpl]sfn|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=74[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Hoon|2006|p=96[/tpl] These flourished during the period of Chinese nationalism in the final years of China's Qing Dynasty and through the Second Sino-Japanese War; however, differences in the object of nationalist sentiments brought about a split in the population. One group supported political reforms in mainland China, while others worked towards improved status in local politics. The New Order  government (1967–1998) dismantled the pillars of ethnic Chinese identity in favor of assimilation policies as a solution to the "Chinese Problem". Patterns of assimilation and ethnic interaction can be found in Indonesia's literature, architecture, and cuisine.
The Chinese Indonesian population of Java accounts for nearly half of the group's national population. Although they are generally more urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population,[tpl]sfn|Heidhues|2001|pp=164–165[/tpl] significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the population pyramid as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations in the second half of the 20th century. Some participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.[tpl]sfn|Cunningham|2008|p=104[/tpl]

The 228 Massacre, 2/28 Massacre, also called 228 Incident by Kuomintang (KMT), or 2/28 for short, was an anti-government uprising in Taiwan that began on February 27, 1947 which was violently suppressed by the KMT-led Republic of China government and which resulted in the massacre of numerous civilians, beginning on February 28, or 2/28. Estimates of the number of deaths vary from 10,000 to 30,000 or more.[tpl]cite web | title=傷亡人數與人才斷層 | url=http://www.taiwanus.net/back_tw_vote/228/book/ch5.htm | work=TaiwanUS.net |accessdate=2008-09-24[/tpl] [tpl]zh icon[/tpl][tpl]cite web |year=1947| title=Formosa killings are put at 10,000| work=New York Times, March 29, 1947 | url=http://www.taiwandc.org/hst-1947.htm | accessdate=2006-04-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060424070637/http://www.taiwandc.org/hst-1947.htm| archivedate= 24 April 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The incident marked the beginning of the Kuomintang's White Terror period in Taiwan, in which thousands more inhabitants vanished, died, or were imprisoned. This incident is one of the most important events in Taiwan's modern history, and is a critical impetus for the Taiwan independence movement.
In 1945, 50 years of Japanese rule of Taiwan ended due to Japan's loss in World War II, and in October the United States on behalf of the Allied Forces handed temporary administrative control of Taiwan to the Kuomintang-administered Republic of China (ROC) under General Order No. 1 to handle the surrender of Japanese troops and ruling administration.  Local inhabitants became resentful of what they perceived as high handed and frequently corrupt KMT authorities inclined to the arbitrary seizure of private property and economic mismanagement.  The flashpoint in tensions came on February 27 in Taipei, when a dispute between a cigarette vendor and an officer of the Office of Monopoly triggered civil disorder and an open rebellion that lasted for days.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] The uprising was violently put down by the military of the Republic of China and the island was placed under martial law.
The subject was officially taboo for decades. On the anniversary of the event in 1995, President Lee Teng-hui addressed the subject publicly, a first for a Taiwanese head of state. The event is now openly discussed and February 28 is commemorated as Peace Memorial Day ([tpl]zh|t=和平紀念日|s=和平纪念日|p=hépíng jìniànrì[/tpl] ), and details of the event have become the subject of government and historian investigation. Every February 28, the president of the ROC gathers with other officials to ring a commemorative bell in memory of the victims. The president bows to family members of 2/28 victims and gives each one a certificate officially exonerating the victim  of any crime, who were previously blacklisted as enemies of the state. Monuments and memorial parks to the victims of 2/28 have been erected in a number of Taiwanese cities, including Kaohsiung and Taipei.二二八紀念碑新新聞521期:比較全台灣各地二二八紀念碑的碑文與形式  Taipei's former "Taipei New Park" was rededicated as 228 Peace Memorial Park and houses the National 228 Memorial Museum to commemorate the tragic incident, which opened on February 28, 2011.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

[[Janus]]

CATEGORIES: Dii Familiaris, Roman gods, Time and fate gods, Tutelary deities, Liminal deities

In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus ([tpl]lang-la|Ianus[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-la|ˈiaː.nus|pron[/tpl]) is the god of beginnings and transitions,Varro apud Augustine De Civitate Dei VII 9 and 3; Servius Aen. I 449; Paulus ex Festus s. v. Chaos p. 45 L thence also of gates, doors, passages, endings and time. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past. The Romans named the month of January (Ianuarius) in his honor.
Janus presided over the beginning and ending of conflict, and hence war and peace. The doors of his temple were open in time of war, and closed to mark the peace. As a god of transitions, he had functions pertaining to birth and to journeys and exchange, and in his association with Portunus, a similar harbor and gateway god, he was concerned with travelling, trading and shipping.
Janus had no flamen or specialized priest (sacerdos) assigned to him, but the King of the Sacred Rites (rex sacrorum) himself carried out his ceremonies. Janus had a ubiquitous presence in religious ceremonies throughout the year, and was ritually invoked at the beginning of each one, regardless of the main deity honored on any particular occasion.
The ancient Greeks had no equivalent to Janus, whom the Romans claimed as distinctively their own. Modern scholars, however, have identified analogous figures in the pantheons of the Near East. His name in Greek is 'Ιανός (Ianós).

Adhocracy is a flexible, adaptable and informal form of organization that is defined by a lack of formal structure. It operates in an opposite fashion to a bureaucracy. The term was first popularized in 1970 by Alvin Toffler,[tpl]cite book|last=Travica|first=Bob|title=New organizational designs: information aspects|year=1999|publisher=Ablex Pub.

The concept has been further developed by academics such as Henry Mintzberg.
Adhocracy is characterized by an adaptive, creative and flexible integrative behavior based on non-permanence and spontaneity. It is believed that these characteristics allow adhocracy to respond faster than traditional bureaucratic organizations while being more open to new ideas.http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/adhocracy.html.

This is possible because of venous communication (via the ophthalmic veins) between the facial vein and the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus lies within the cranial cavity, between layers of the meninges and is a major conduit of venous drainage from the brain.[tpl]cite journal | title=Craniofacial Venous Plexuses: Angiographic Study | author=Osborn AG | journal=AJR |date=Jan 1981  | volume=136 | pages=139–143[/tpl]
It is a common misconception that the veins of the head do not contain one-way valves like other veins of the circulatory system. In fact, it is not the absence of venous valves but the existence of communications between the facial vein and cavernous sinus and the direction of blood flow that is important in the spread of infection from the face.

The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on 18 April 1942, was  an air raid by the United States on the Japanese capital Tokyo and other places on Honshu island during World War II, the first air raid to strike the Japanese Home Islands. It demonstrated that Japan itself was vulnerable to American air attack, was retaliation for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, provided an important boost to U.S. morale, and damaged Japanese morale. The raid was planned and led by Lieutenant Colonel James "Jimmy" Doolittle, U.S. Army Air Forces.
Sixteen U.S. Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers were launched without fighter escort from the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier [tpl]USS|Hornet|CV-8|6[/tpl] deep in the Western Pacific Ocean, each with a crew of five men. The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan, and to continue westward to land in China—landing a medium bomber on Hornet was impossible. Fifteen of the aircraft reached China, and the other one landed in the Soviet Union. All but three of the crew survived, but all the aircraft were lost. Eight crewmen were captured by the Japanese Army in China; three of these were executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union at Vladivostok was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year. Fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned either to the United States or to American forces.Glines 1998, pp. 166–168. 
After the raid, the Japanese Imperial Army conducted a massive sweep through the eastern coastal provinces of China, in an operation now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, searching for the surviving American airmen and applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them, in an effort to prevent this part of China from being used again for an attack on Japan. An estimated 250,000 Chinese civilians were killed by the Japanese during this operation."The Perilous Fight." PBS. Retrieved: 22 November 2011.Nelson 2002, pp. 226–228.
The raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, only hitting non-military targets or missing completely but it succeeded in its goal of raising American morale and casting doubt in Japan on the ability of its military leaders to defend their home islands. It also caused Japan to withdraw its powerful aircraft carrier force from the Indian Ocean to defend their Home Islands, and the raid contributed to Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's decision to attack Midway Island in the Central Pacific—an attack that turned into a decisive strategic defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the Battle of Midway. Doolittle, who initially believed that loss of all his aircraft would lead to his being court-martialled, received the Medal of Honor and was promoted two steps to Brigadier general.

Jacques Herbrand (12 February 1908 – 27 July 1931) was a French mathematician. Although he died at only 23 years of age, he was already considered one of "the greatest mathematicians of the younger generation" by his professors Helmut Hasse, and Richard Courant.[tpl]Cite book |last=Chevalley |first=Claude |last2=Lautman |first2=Albert |title=Logical Writings |chapter=Biographical Note on Jacques Herbrand |editor-last=Goldfarb |editor-first=Warren D. |editor2-last=Van Heijenoort |editor2-first=Jean |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |year=1971 |pages=21–23 |isbn=90-277-0176-8 [/tpl]
He worked in mathematical logic and class field theory. He introduced recursive functions. Herbrand's theorem refers to either of two completely different theorems. One is a result from his doctoral thesis in proof theory, and the other one half of the Herbrand–Ribet theorem. The Herbrand quotient is a type of Euler characteristic, used in homological algebra. He contributed to Hilbert's program in the foundations of mathematics by providing a constructive consistency proof for a weak system of arithmetic. The proof uses the above mentioned, proof-theoretic Herbrand's Theorem.

Mascots are also used as fictional, representative spokespeople for consumer products, such as the rabbit used in advertising and marketing for the General Mills brand of breakfast cereal, Trix.
In the world of sports, mascots are also used for merchandising. Team mascots are often confused with team nicknames.Marc's Collection of Mascots: Introduction While the two can be interchangeable, they are not always the same. For example, the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed the Crimson Tide, while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al. Team mascots may take the form of a logo, person, live animal, inanimate object, or a costumed character, and often appear at team matches and other related events, sports mascots are often used as marketing tools for their teams to children. Since the mid-20th century, costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot, as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies' mascot, the Phillie Phanatic.
Costumed mascots are commonplace, and are regularly used as goodwill ambassadors in the community for their team, company, or organization such as the U.S. Forest Service's Smokey Bear.

In Star Wars: Episode II, Obi-Wan Kenobi was directed here to follow a lead on the whereabouts of Senator Amidala's would-be assassin through a single poison dart. During Obi-Wan's stay on Kamino at Tipoca City, he discovered the source of the Clone Army's genetic code, one Jango Fett and his "son" Boba Fett.
Once he was discovered, Jango narrowly escaped the planet with Boba, with Obi-Wan close behind.  Yoda later returned and brought a contingent of these clone warriors to assist in the rescue of Obi-Wan, Anakin, Padmé and the Jedi Knights at the end of Attack of the Clones to begin the fabled Clone Wars. When the Separatists discovered the source of the clones, they launched an attack on Kamino, but the Battle of Kamino was won by the Republic. The name "Kamino" is a play on amino or amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins; hence the cloning industry.

[[Christian music industry]]
CATEGORIES: Christian music, Music industry

The Christian music industry is a small part of the larger music industry, that focuses on traditional Gospel music, Southern Gospel music, Contemporary Christian music, and alternative Christian music. It is sometimes called the gospel music industry, although this designation is not a limitation on the musical styles represented. The industry has roots in Jesus Music, although in order to commercialize and gain a wide appeal, the music had to largely move away from the form of that movement.
Christian artists generally use secular styles, pairing them with lyrics that display faith and spirituality to varying degrees. Generally speaking, the industry is influenced by mainstream culture. Musical trends, for instance, follow those of the secular scene, though usually a few years behind.[tpl]Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="dc Talk" p. 239.[/tpl] Quote: "Of course the Christian market was a few years behind the rest of the world... it always is." emphasis[tpl]cite journal |last=Urbanski |first=David |date=July 1997 |title=One Crazy Summer |journal=CCM Magazine |id=[tpl]ISSN|1524-7848[/tpl] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=24–32 |ref=harv[/tpl] The Christian music industry carries the distinction of being the only music subculture whose content is labeled by its lyrical dimension rather than its music.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Still, music within the industry is sold by its musical style rather than lyrical content.
Christian music's critics point to the divergent interests of commercialization and ministry, which have, according to some, polar opposite goals. Aspects of Christian music have long struggled to gain general acceptance, even within the Christian community. What some see as secularization and a lacking of direct theology, others see as artistic ministry. This opens up questions of the definition of "Christian music" that have lingered over the industry since its inception.
The Christian music industry experienced explosive growth in the 1990s. Christian music sales grew to exceed those for classical, jazz, and new age music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cmta.com/GMA_Industry_Overview_2008.pdf |title=GMA Industry Overview 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=Christian Music Trade Association[/tpl] Even so, the Christian music industry has experienced the same issues as the general market in recent years.

Tolstoy clashed with editor Mikhail Katkov over political issues that arose in the final installment (Tolstoy's unpopular views of volunteers going to Serbia); therefore, the novel's first complete appearance was in book form in 1878.
Widely regarded as a pinnacle in realist fiction, Tolstoy considered Anna Karenina his first true novel, when he came to consider War and Peace to be more than a novel.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky declared it to be "flawless as a work of art". His opinion was shared by Vladimir Nabokov, who especially admired "the flawless magic of Tolstoy's style", and by William Faulkner, who described the novel as "the best ever written".Tolstoy, Leo. Anna Karenina. Penguin Publishing. ISBN 978-0-14-044917-4. Faulkner's opinion is used as an advert on the inside cover. The novel is currently enjoying popularity, as demonstrated by a recent poll of 125 contemporary authors by J. Peder Zane, published in 2007 in "The Top Ten" in Time, which declared that Anna Karenina is the "greatest novel ever written".Grossman, Lev (January 15, 2007). "The 10 Greatest Books of All Time".

[[Western Approaches]]
CATEGORIES: Atlantic Ocean

The Western Approaches is a rectangular area of the Atlantic ocean lying on the western coast of British Isles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] The rectangle area is higher than it is wide, with the north and south boundaries defined by the north and south ends of the British Isles, the eastern boundary lying on the western coast, and the western boundary in the Atlantic roughly at Iceland. The area is particularly important to the United Kingdom, because many of its larger shipping ports lie in this area.
The term is most commonly used when discussing naval warfare, notably during the First World War and Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War in which the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) attempted to blockade the United Kingdom using submarines (U-boats) operating in this area. Since almost all shipping to and from the United Kingdom passed through this area, it was an excellent hunting ground and had to be heavily defended.

One of eight civil parishes with city status in England, Lichfield is situated roughly [tpl]convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Birmingham. At the time of the 2011 Census the population was estimated at 32,219 and the wider Lichfield District at 100,700.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/interactive/vp2-2011-census-comparator/index.html|title = Office for National Statistics - Census 2011|date = 20 July 2012[/tpl]
Notable for its three-spired medieval cathedral, Lichfield was the birthplace of Samuel Johnson, the writer of the first authoritative Dictionary of the English Language. The city's recorded history began when Chad of Mercia arrived to establish his Bishopric in 669 CE and the settlement grew as the ecclesiastical centre of Mercia. In 2009, the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork, was found [tpl]convert|5.9|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Lichfield.
The development of the city was consolidated in the 12th century under Roger de Clinton who fortified the Cathedral Close and also laid out the town with the ladder-shaped street pattern that survives to this day. Lichfield's heyday was in the 18th century when it developed into a thriving coaching city. This was a period of great intellectual activity, the city being the home of many famous people including Samuel Johnson, David Garrick, Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward, and prompted Johnson's remark that Lichfield was "a city of philosophers".
Today, the city still retains its old importance as an ecclesiastical centre, and its industrial and commercial development has been limited. The centre of the city retains an unspoilt charm with over 230 listed buildings in its historic streets, fine Georgian architecture and old cultural traditions. People from Lichfield are known as Lichfeldians.

[[Goodhart's law]]

CATEGORIES: Economics of regulation, Econometrics, Adages, Economics laws

Goodhart's law is named after the banker who originated it, Charles Goodhart. Its most popular formulation is:  "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
The original formulation by Goodhart, a former advisor to the Bank of England and Emeritus Professor at the London School of Economics, is this: "As soon as the government attempts to regulate any particular set of financial assets, these become unreliable as indicators of economic trends." This is because investors try to anticipate what the effect of the regulation will be, and invest so as to benefit from it. Goodhart first used it in a 1975 paper, and it later became used popularly to criticize the United Kingdom government of Margaret Thatcher for trying to conduct monetary policy on the basis of targets for broad and narrow money. However, the concept is considerably older, and closely related ideas are known under different names, e.g. Campbell's Law (1976), and the Lucas critique (1976). The law is implicit in the economic idea of rational expectations.  While it originated in the context of market responses, the law has profound implications for the selection of high-level targets in organisations.[ref]

RAF Coastal Command was a formation within the Royal Air Force (RAF). Founded in 1936, it was the RAF's premier maritime arm, after the Royal Navy's secondment of the Fleet Air Arm in 1937. Naval aviation was neglected in the inter-war period, 1919–1939, and as a consequence the service did not receive the resources it needed to develop properly or efficiently. This continued until the outbreak of the Second World War, during which it came to prominence. But owing to the Air Ministry's concentration on RAF Fighter Command and RAF Bomber Command, Coastal Command was often referred to as the "Cinderella Service", a phrase first used by the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time A V Alexander.Hendrie 2006, p. 60.
Its primary task was to protect convoys from the German Kriegsmarine's U-Boat force, known as the "wolfpacks". It also protected Allied shipping from the aerial threat posed by the Luftwaffe. The main operations of Coastal Command were defensive, defending supply lines in the various theatres of war, most notably the Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres and the battle of the Atlantic. It also served in an offensive capacity. In the Mediterranean theatre and the Baltic sea it carried out attacks on German shipping moving war materials from Italy to North Africa and from Scandinavia to Germany. By 1943 Coastal Command finally received the recognition it needed and its operations proved decisive in the victory over the U-Boats.
The service saw action from the first day of hostilities until the last day of the Second World War. It flew over one million flying hours,Bowyer 1979, p.43. 240,000 operations and destroyed 212 U-boats.Hendrie 2006, p. 179. Coastal Command's casualties amounted to 2,060 aircraft to all causes and some 5,866 personnel killed in action. From 1940 to 1945 Coastal Command sank 366 German transport vessels and damaged 134. The total tonnage sunk was 512,330 tonsGoulter 1995, p. 353. and another 513,454 tons damaged.Hendrie 2006, p. 179. A total of 10,663 persons were rescued by the Command, including 5,721 Allied crews, 277 enemy personnel, and 4,665 non-aircrews.Ashworth 1992, p. 179.
After the war, the Command continued Anti-Submarine Warfare duties during the Cold War, to combat the threat posed by the Soviet Navy and those fleets of the Warsaw Pact.

Marvin, the Paranoid Android, is a fictional character in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams. Marvin is the ship's robot aboard the starship Heart of Gold. Originally built as a failed prototype of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation's GPP (Genuine People Personalities) technology, Marvin is afflicted with severe depression and boredom, in part because he has a "brain the size of a planet"On Wikiquote which he is seldom, if ever, given the chance to use. Indeed, the true horror of Marvin's existence is that no task he could be given would occupy even the tiniest fraction of his vast intellect. Marvin claims he is 50,000 times more intelligent than a human,[tpl]cite book |title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |page=92[/tpl] (or 30 billion times more intelligent than a live mattress) though this is, if anything, a vast underestimation. When kidnapped by the bellicose Krikkit robots and tied to the interfaces of their intelligent war computer, Marvin simultaneously manages to plan the entire planet's military strategy, solve "all of the major mathematical, physical, chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three times over," and compose a number of lullabies.
Marvin's voice was performed by Stephen Moore on the radio and television series, while Alan Rickman voiced this role in the film. David Learner operated his body on television, having previously played and voiced the part for the stage version, and Warwick Davis wore the Marvin costume for the feature film. A recreation of the costume from the 1981 television series makes an appearance in the film, as one of the robots standing in a queue on Vogsphere, where the main characters are trying to release Tricia.

[[Lagrange multiplier]]

CATEGORIES: Multivariable calculus, Mathematical optimization, Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics)

In mathematical optimization, the method of Lagrange multipliers (named after Joseph Louis Lagrange) is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.
For instance (see Figure 1), consider the optimization problem
We need both [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|g[/tpl] to have continuous first partial derivatives.  We introduce a new variable ([tpl]mvar|λ[/tpl]) called a Lagrange multiplier and study the Lagrange function (or Lagrangian) defined by
where the [tpl]mvar|λ[/tpl] term may be either added or subtracted. If [tpl]math|f(x0, y0)[/tpl] is a maximum of [tpl]math|f(x, y)[/tpl] for the original constrained problem, then there exists [tpl]math|λ0[/tpl] such that [tpl]math|(x0, y0, λ0)[/tpl] is a stationary point for the Lagrange function (stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of [tpl]mvar|Λ[/tpl] are zero, i.e., [tpl]math|∇Λ [tpl]=[/tpl] 0[/tpl]). However, not all stationary points yield a solution of the original problem.

[[Expectations from the Muslim Woman]]

CATEGORIES: Works by Ali Shariati, Islam and women

Expectations from the Muslim Woman, also called Our Expectations of the Muslim Woman, is regarded as one of Ali Shariati's most important lectures referring to women's rights in Islam. 
The point of his lecture is not to show that women's rights do not exist in Islam, but to show that what Shariati saw as anti-Islamic traditions have had tragic results for Muslim women. He uses Fatima Zahra, the daughter of Muhammad, as an example of a woman who played a significant role in political life.
He begins his lecture by stating that:
 Most often, we are satisfied by pointing out that Islam gives great value to science or establishes progressive rights for women. Unfortunately we never actually use or benefit from this value or these rights. 
He continues by stating that:
 From the 18th through to the 20th century (particularly after World War 2) any attempt to address the special problem of the social rights of women and their specific characteristics has been seen as a mere by-product of a spiritual or psychic shock or the result of a revolutionary crisis in centers of learning or as a response to political currents and international movements. Thus, traditional societies, historical societies, religious societies, either in the East or in the West (be they tribal, Bedouin, civilized Muslim or non-Muslim societies, in whatever social or cultural stage of civilization they may be) have all been directly or indirectly influenced by these thoughts, intellectual currents and even new social realities. 
He argues that the liberation of women has begun in the West, and many fear it occurring in the Muslim world, in part because they are misinformed, and have not looked at Islam through an historical perspective, and are relying on their own misinterpretation of Islam:
 In such societies the newly-educated class, the pseudo-intellectuals, who are in the majority, strongly and vigorously welcome this crisis. They themselves even act as one of the forces that strengthen this corrupting and destructive transformation. 
Shariati believed that women in Iran under the Shah were only sexually liberated and did not have any social freedom. He attributed this in part to the "rather bourgeois cognition," and in part to the Freudian ideal of sexual liberation. To Shariati, Freud was one of the agents of the bourgeois:
 Up to the appearance of Freud (who was one of the agents of the bourgeoisie), it was through the liberal bourgeois spirit that scientific sexualism was manifested. It must be taken into consideration that the bourgeoisie is always an inferior class. 
He concludes that a scholar or scientist who lives, thinks, and studies during the bourgeois age, measures collective, cultural, and spiritual values based on the economy, production and consumption.

Muslims believe that the prophet Abraham became the leader of the righteous in his time and it was through him that the people of both Arabia and Israel came. Abraham, in the belief of Islam, was instrumental in cleansing the world of idolatry at the time. Paganism was cleared out by Abraham in both Arabia and Canaan. He spiritually purified both places as well as physically sanctifying the houses of worship. Abraham and Ismail (Ishmael) further established the rites of pilgrimage,[tpl]Cite quran|2|128|s=ns[/tpl] or Hajj, which are still followed by Muslims today.

Richard Barnfield (born 1574) was an English poet.
His obscure though close relationship with William Shakespeare has long made him interesting to scholars.  It has been suggested that he was the "rival poet" mentioned in Shakespeare's sonnets.William Shakespeare, Richard Barnfield, and the sixth Earl of Derby.(Brief article)(Book review)." Reference & Research Book News. Book News Inc. 2010. Accessed via HighBeam Research. 16 Dec. 2013  (subscription required).
Barnfield was born at Norbury, Staffordshire, and brought up in Newport, Shropshire. He was baptized on 13 June 1574, the son of Richard Barnfield, gentleman.
In November 1589 Barnfield matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, and took his degree in February 1592. He performed the exercise for his masters gown, but seems to have left the university abruptly, without proceeding to the M.A.
It is conjectured that he came up to London in 1593, and became acquainted with Watson, Drayton, and perhaps with Edmund Spenser. The death of Sir Philip Sidney had occurred while Barnfield was still a school-boy, but it seems to have strongly affected his imagination and to have inspired some of his earliest verses.

Mutt and Jeff were two Norwegian spies who worked for the United Kingdom and MI5 and were members of the Double Cross System.
In April 1941 two Norwegians, John "Helge" Moe (Mutt) and Tor Glad (Jeff) fetched up on a remote Aberdeenshire beach, having travelled by seaplane and rubber dinghy. They immediately turned themselves in to the local police as German spies. MI5 soon 'turned' them, assigning them their codenames, which were the names of a pair of cartoon strip characters (see Mutt and Jeff).  'Mutt and Jeff' is also rhyming slang for 'deaf'.[tpl]cite web |url= https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/25-november-2002-releases-double-cross-agents.html |title=MI5 | Double Cross Agents |work=mi5.gov.uk |year=2011  |accessdate=14 July 2012[/tpl]
Mutt and Jeff's mission was supposed to be one of sabotage, as well as having a secondary intelligence role, reporting (via wireless) military locations, deployments and civilian morale. MI5 used Mutt and Jeff's radio sets to relay false information, leading the Germans to believe that the United Kingdom intended to invade Norway (this activity was a component of Operation Fortitude). To ensure the German handlers did not suspect Mutt and Jeff of having sold out, MI5 arranged for fake sabotage operations - supposedly the work of the pair - to take place, in one case going so far as to set off a controlled explosion at a power plant which was widely reported in the local media as a genuine attack.
Doubts about Glad's reliability led MI5 to eventually intern him in 1943[tpl]fact|date=May 2014[/tpl], and his radio transmissions were carried on by Moe until February 1944. By then MI5 believed that the Germans may have learned of Glad's detention, and so the operation was brought to a close.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1333056/John-Moe.html |title=Obituary : John Moe |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 July 2001 |publisher=TMG |location=London |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=14 July 2012[/tpl]

The Legion of Super-Heroes is a fictional superhero team in the 30th and 31st centuries of the [tpl]DC Universe[/tpl]. The team first appears in Adventure Comics #247 (April 1958), and was created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino.
Initially, the team was closely associated with the original Superboy (Superman when he was a teenager), and was first portrayed as a group of time travelers who frequently visited him. In later years, the Legion's origin and back story were fleshed out, and the group was given prominence on par with Superboy's in a monthly comic. Eventually, Superboy was removed altogether, except as an occasional guest star.
The team has undergone two major reboots during its publication. The original version was replaced with a new rebooted version following the events of "Zero Hour" in 1994 and another rebooted team was introduced in 2004. A fourth version of the team, nearly identical to the original version, was introduced in 2007.

They were first introduced in the 1991 episode "Ensign Ro" of Star Trek: The Next Generation and subsequently were a pivotal element of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and also appeared in Star Trek: Voyager. The shows' writers initially depicted the Bajorans as an oppressed people who were often forced to live as refugees, whom they likened to a variety of ethnic groups. Rick Berman, who helped to originally conceive them, compared them to "the Palestinians, the Jews in the 1940s, the boat people from Haiti — unfortunately, the homeless and terrorism are problems every age."Nemecek, Larry (1995).

Moore similarly commented, "depending on the episode, you could also call Bajor Israel, or Iran, or even America and the Cardassians could be Germans, or Russians or several other examples… but we don't really try to make Bajor a direct analogy to any specific contemporary country or people."Moore, Ronald D. AOL chats. http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Memory_Alpha:AOL_chats/Ronald_D._Moore/ron012.txt Various Bajoran characters were included in several of the Star Trek series, including Ro Laren (played by Michelle Forbes) in The Next Generation as well as a number of others in Deep Space Nine, which was set on a space station near to Bajor, and which featured Bajoran characters such as Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) and Winn Adami (Louise Fletcher).

[[Class M planet]]

CATEGORIES: Star Trek terminology

[tpl]Redirect|Class Y|for other meanings|Y class (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Y class[/tpl]
Class M is a fictional classification for planets and planetoids in the Star Trek science fiction media franchise. The term is explained in-universe as deriving from the Vulcan term "Minshara."Star Trek: Enterprise: Strange New World
Their atmospheres are composed of nitrogen and oxygen and have an abundance of liquid water necessary for carbon-based life to exist. Extensive plant and animal life often flourishes; often, a sentient race is also present. Earth is a textbook example of a Class M world; other Class M planets that appear throughout the franchise include Vulcan, Cardassia Prime, Bajor, Betazed, Romulus, Ferenginar, Qo'noS, and Nibiru.[tpl]cite book|last=Erdmann|first=Terry J.|coauthors=Paula M. Block|year=2008|title =Star Trek 101|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-7434-9723-6|pages=21|quote=What is Class M? It is a designation used to describe a planet capable of supporting life “as we know it”. With a breathable oxygen–nitrogen atmosphere and a temperature range that won’t boil the crew’s blood. Most of the planets the Enterprise stops at fit the classification and are very Earth-like. Which is very convenient for filming on location.[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Star Trek Star Charts: The Complete Atlas of Star Trek |first=Geoffrey|last=Mandel|year=2002|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-7434-3770-5[/tpl][tpl]rp|27[/tpl]
In fiction, Class M planets are similar to those suggested to be found in the real-world astronomical theory of life supporting planets found within the habitable zone (HZ), sometimes also referred to as the 'Goldilocks' zone. The Earth Similarity Index, a scale used in planetary science, includes within its classification of habitable planets (hClass) a "Class M", where the "M" stands for mesoplanet (not to be confused with Asimov's mesoplanet proposal), i. e., a planet with moderate (as necessary for liquid water) temperatures, more technically speaking: the thermal surface requirements necessary to support complex (multicellular) Earth-like life.

Zorro ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɔː|ɹ|oʊ[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-es|ˈθoro|lang[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-es|ˈsoro|am[/tpl]) is a character created in 1919 by New York–based pulp writer Johnston McCulley. The character has been featured in numerous books, films, television series, and other media. Zorro (Spanish for "fox") is the secret identity of Don Diego de la Vega, a Californio nobleman and master living in Los Angeles during the era of Spanish rule.
The character has undergone changes through the years, but the typical image of him is a dashing black-clad masked outlaw who defends the people of the land against tyrannical officials and other villains. Not only is he too cunning and foxlike for the bumbling authorities to catch, but also delights in publicly humiliating them.

[[Clitoral hood piercing]]

CATEGORIES: Female genital piercings, Clitoris

A clitoral hood piercing is a female genital piercing through the clitoral hood surrounding the clitoris.  There are two main types of hood piercing, the vertical clitoral hood piercing and the horizontal clitoral hood piercing. As the name indicates, the difference is in the direction the piercing is oriented in the skin above the clitoris.  Neither of these piercings penetrates the clitoris itself.
Like most genital piercings, these piercings have relatively short healing times, due to the amount of blood flow to the area.  During the healing period however, the piercing is a wound and can increase the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.

[[Day of Reconciliation]]

CATEGORIES: December observances, Secular holidays, South African society, History of KwaZulu-Natal, History of South Africa

The Day of Reconciliation is a public holiday in South Africa held annually on 16 December. The date was chosen because it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures.  The holiday came into effect in 1994 after the end of apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity.  The day is also the de facto start of the South African summer holiday period being the first of four public holidays to fall in a sixteen-day period at the height of summer. (The other days are Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day).
For Afrikaners, 16 December was commemorated as the Day of the Vow, also known as Day of the Covenant or Dingaan's Day. The Day of the Vow was a religious holiday commemorating the Voortrekker victory over the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River in 1838, and is still celebrated by some Boers. On the other side of the political spectrum, 16 December is also the anniversary of the 1961 founding of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the armed wing of the African National Congress.
