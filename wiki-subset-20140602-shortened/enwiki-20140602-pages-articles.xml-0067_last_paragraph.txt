Jughead Jones is a fictional character in Archie Comics who first appeared in the comic in December 1941. He is the son of Forsythe II; in one of the early Archie newspaper comic strips, he himself is identified as Forsythe Pendleton Jones III (and in one strip, likely due to continuity error, as Forsythe Van Jones). He has a white sheepdog named Hot Dog and  a younger sister, Forsythia "Jellybean" Jones.
Jughead (sometimes shortened to Jug or Juggie) is the best friend of Archie Andrews. He is  seen as lazy, obsessed with food, and generally uninterested in girls. He stands at 6 ft (1.8 m) and 140 lbs (64 kg) and can be identified by his long nose, half-closed eyes, "S" sweatshirt, and crown-like button beanie hat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://learning2share.blogspot.com/2009/04/search-term-jugheads-hat.html |title=I'm Learning To Share!: Search term: "Jughead's hat" |publisher=Learning2share.blogspot.com |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2010-10-04[/tpl]

Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon (0.1 to 0.25%)
content in contrast to cast iron (2.1% to 4%), and has fibrous inclusions, known as slag up to 2% by weight. It is a semi-fused mass of iron with slag inclusions which gives it a "grain" resembling wood, that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure. Wrought iron is tough, malleable, ductile and easily welded. Historically, it was known as commercially pure iron;[tpl]Citation | last = Imhoff | first = Wallace G. | title = Puddle Cinder as a Blast Furnace Iron Ore | journal = Journal of the Cleveland Engineering Society | volume = 9 | issue = 621.76 | pages = 332 | year = 1917 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=OA_OAAAAMAAJ[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | last = Scoffern | first = John | title = The useful metals and their alloys | page = 6 | publisher = Houlston & Wright | year = 1869 | edition = 5th | url = http://books.google.com/?id=4Ik1AAAAMAAJ[/tpl]. however, it no longer qualifies because current standards for commercially pure iron require a carbon content of less than 0.008 wt%.[tpl]Citation | last = McArthur | first = Hugh | last2 = Spalding | first2 = Duncan | title = Engineering materials science: properties, uses, degradation and remediation | page = 338 | publisher = Horwood Publishing | year = 2004 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=7dwAaOqp69wC | isbn = 978-1-898563-11-2[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | last = Campbell | first = Flake C. | title = Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys | publisher = ASM International | page= 154 | year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C | isbn = 978-0-87170-867-0[/tpl].
Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel, wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron. A modest amount of wrought iron was used as a raw material for refining into steel, which was used mainly to produce swords, cutlery, chisels, axes and other edged tools as well as springs and files. The demand for wrought iron reached its peak in the 1860s with the adaptation of ironclad warships and railways, but then declined as mild steel quality problems such as brittleness were solved and it became inexpensive and widely available.
Many items, before they came to be made of mild steel, were produced from wrought iron, including rivets, nails, wire, chains, rails,  railway couplings, water and steam pipes, nuts, bolts, horseshoes, handrails, straps for timber roof trusses, and ornamental ironwork.
Wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale. Many products described as wrought iron, such as guard rails, garden furniture[tpl]cite news |title=Wrought Iron: A Patio Furniture dream |work=cnet reviews |url=http://www.patioset.com/Wrought_Iron_Patio_Sets/ |accessdate=2009-09-29[/tpl] and gates, are made of mild steel. They retain that description because in the past they were wrought (worked) by hand.Daniel, Todd (May 3, 1997), Clearing the Confusion Over Wrought Iron, http://www.artmetal.com/project/NOMMA/WROUGHT.HTM, retrieved 2008-01-05

CATEGORIES: Digestive system

The jejunum ([tpl]IPAc-en|dʒ|ɨ|ˈ|dʒ|uː|n|əm[/tpl]OED 2nd edition, 1989.Entry "jejunum" in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary.) is the middle section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms middle intestine or mid-gut may be used instead of jejunum.
The jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum. The change from the duodenum to the jejunum is usually defined as the Duodenojejunal flexure and is attached, and thus "hung up", to the ventricle (see stomach) by the ligament of Treitz.[tpl]cite journal |author=van Gijn J |title=Treitz and his ligament. |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. |volume=155 |issue=8 |year=2011 |pmid=21557825 |author-separator=, |author2=Gijselhart JP |display-authors=2[/tpl]
In adult humans, the small intestine is usually between 5.5 and 6m long, 2.5mThe Gale Group, Inc. (2008). Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine of which is the jejunum.
The pH in the jejunum is usually between 7 and 9 (neutral or slightly alkaline).
If the jejunum is impacted by blunt force the emesis reflex (vomiting) will be initiated.
The jejunum and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which gives the bowel great mobility within the abdomen. It also contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle which helps to move food along by a process known as peristalsis.

[[Small intestine]]
CATEGORIES: Abdomen, Digestive system, Organs

The small intestine (or small bowel) is the part of the gastrointestinal tract following the stomach and followed by the large intestine, and is where much of the digestion and absorption of food takes place. The small intestine is composed of a duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. It receives bile juice and pancreatic juice through the hepatopancreatic duct, controlled by the sphincter of Oddi. In invertebrates such as worms, the terms "gastrointestinal tract" and "large intestine" are often used to describe the entire intestine. This article is primarily about the human gut, though the information about its processes is directly applicable to most placental mammals. The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals found in food.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275485/human-body (A major exception to this is cows; for information about digestion in cows and other similar mammals, see ruminants and platypus.)

The appendix (or vermiform appendix; also cecal caecal appendix; also vermix) is a blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops embryologically. The cecum is a pouchlike structure of the colon. The appendix is located near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine.
The term "vermiform" comes from Latin and means "worm-shaped".

Frederick II ([tpl]lang-de|links=no|Friedrich II.[/tpl]; 24 January 1712[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]17 August 1786) was King in Prussia (1740–1786) of the Hohenzollern dynasty.Frederick was the third and last "King in Prussia"; beginning in 1772 he used the title "King of Prussia". He is best known for his military victories, his reorganization of Prussian armies, his innovative drills and tactics, and his final success against great odds in the Seven Years' War.  He became known as Frederick the Great (Friedrich der Große) and was nicknamed Der Alte Fritz ("Old Fritz").
In his youth, Frederick was more interested in music and philosophy than the art of war. He defied his authoritarian father, Frederick William I, and sought to run away with his close friend Hans Hermann von Katte. They were caught and the king nearly executed his son for "desertion"; he did force Frederick to watch the execution of Hans. Upon ascending to the Prussian throne, he attacked Austria and claimed Silesia during the Silesian Wars, winning military acclaim for himself and Prussia. Near the end of his life, Frederick physically connected most of his realm by conquering Polish territories in the First Partition of Poland. He was an influential military theorist whose analysis emerged from his extensive personal battlefield experience and covered issues of strategy, tactics, mobility and logistics.
Frederick was a proponent of enlightened absolutism. He modernized the Prussian bureaucracy and civil service and pursued religious policies throughout his realm that ranged from tolerance to oppression.Stanislaw Salmonowicz, "Was Frederick the Great an Enlightened Absolute Ruler?"  Polish Western Affairs (1981) 22#1 pp 56-69 He reformed the judicial system and made it possible for men not of noble stock to become judges and senior bureaucrats. Some critics however point out his oppressive measures against conquered Polish subjects.Conquest: How Societies Overwhelm Others by David Day Oxford University Press,page 212, 2008 He limited freedom of citizens of his country[tpl]elucidate|date=February 2014[/tpl] and introduced harsh compulsory military service.
Frederick supported arts and philosophers he favored, but at the same enacted several laws censoring the press. Frederick is buried at his favorite residence, Sanssouci in Potsdam. Because he died childless, Frederick was succeeded by his nephew, Frederick William II of Prussia, son of his brother, Prince Augustus William of Prussia.
Nearly all 19th century German historians made Frederick into a romantic model of a glorified warrior, praising his leadership, administrative efficiency, devotion to duty and success in building up Prussia to a leading role in Europe.  Historian Leopold von Ranke was unstinting in his praise of Frederick's "Heroic life, inspired by great ideas, filled with feats of arms...immortalized by the raising of the Prussian state to the rank of a power." Johann Gustav Droysen was even more extolling.G. P. Gooch, Frederick the Great: The Ruler, the Writer, the Man (1947) p 343-76; quote p 346  He remained an admired historical figure through the German Empire's crushing defeat in First World War, and the Nazis glorified him as great German leader pre-figuring Hitler, but his reputation became far less favorable after the fall of the Nazi regime in 1945 in both East and West Germany.Jürgen Angelow, "Kontexte ungleicher Deutung," Zeitschrift fuer Religions und Geistesgeschichte (2004) 56#2 pp 136-151.

[[Mother-in-law joke]]

CATEGORIES: Joke cycles, Family, Stereotypes

Humour and jokes about one's mother-in-law (the mother of one's spouse) are a mainstay of comedy. The humour is based on the premise that the average mother-in-law often considers her son-in-law to be unsuitable for her daughter (or daughter-in-law unsuitable for her son), and usually includes the stereotype that mothers-in-law are generally overbearing, obnoxious, or unattractive. This has commonly been referred to as the "battle."
British comedians such as Les Dawson and Jim Davidson have often used them, and many television sitcoms have featured stereotypical mothers-in-law. 
There is evidence that this joke dates back to Roman times: Satire VI by Juvenal says that one cannot be happy while one's mother-in-law is still alive. Most of the mother-in-law jokes are easily translatable to other languages and are easily understandable in most European cultures.
In a book on cartooning written by Dave Breger, the author lists a series of "tired gags," and gives a suggestion on how to exploit them. In his illustration, Breger and his wife go to a museum and see a Tyrannosaurus skeleton. Mrs. Breger says, "And no funny remarks, please, about that Mother called or something..."
A study of mothers-in-law by Dr. Pamela Cotterill found that "they tended not to be upset by jokes because they seemed so far fetched they couldn't apply to them, but they didn't find them funny". Cotterill also found that daughters-in-law didn't find them funny either, largely because they saw that one day they could be applied to them.Luisa Dillner: Mothers-in-law are lovely, in their place. Their own place, that is - Commentators - Voices - The IndependentMothers and Daughters-in-Law: A Study of Intergenerational Relationships Between Family Women. Staffordshire Polytechnic, 1989
The jokes are considered offensive by some. A widely reported case is the that of the London borough where a workshop leaflet called "Cultural Awareness: General Problems" advised against using them. The leaflet states that "mother-in-law jokes, as well as offensively sexist in their own right, can also be seen as offensive on the grounds that they disrespect elders or parents."

Mannheim ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈmanhaɪm[/tpl] [tpl]Audio|Mannheim.ogg|listen[/tpl], Alemannic: Manne) is a city in the southwestern part of Germany, the third-largest in the German state of Baden-Württemberg after Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. Mannheim is among the twenty largest cities in Germany with a 2012 population of approximately 295,000 inhabitants. The city is at the centre of the larger densely populated Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region which has a population of 2,400,000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.m-r-n.com/start/investieren-und-wirtschaften/rhein-neckar-in-zahlen.html|title=Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar|publisher=M-r-n.com|accessdate=2014-02-13[/tpl] and is Germany's eighth-largest metropolitan region.
Mannheim is located at the confluence of the Rhine and the Neckar in the northwestern corner of Baden-Württemberg. The Rhine separates Mannheim from the city of Ludwigshafen, just to the west of it in Rhineland-Palatinate, and the border of Baden-Württemberg with Hesse is just to the north. Mannheim is downstream along the Neckar from the city of Heidelberg.
Mannheim is unusual among German cities in that its streets and avenues are laid out in a grid pattern, leading to its nickname "die Quadratestadt" ("city of the squares"). The eighteenth century Mannheim Palace, former home of the Prince-elector of the Palatinate, now houses the University of Mannheim.
The city is home to Daimler, John Deere, Caterpillar, ABB, IBM, Roche, Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever, Phoenix Group, Siemens, and several other well-known companies. In addition, Mannheim's SAP Arena is not only the home of the German ice hockey record champions the Adler Mannheim, but also the well-known handball team, the Rhein-Neckar Löwen. According to the Forbes magazine, Mannheim is known for its exceptional inventive power and was ranked 11th among the Top 15 of the most inventive cities worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2013/07/09/worlds-15-most-inventive-cities|title=World's 15 Most Inventive Cities|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=2014-02-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theneweconomy.com/technology/the-manhattan-of-germany-the-innovative-mannheim-city|title=The Manhattan of Germany: the innovative Mannheim city|publisher=The New Economy|accessdate=2014-03-23[/tpl] The New Economy Magazine elected Mannheim under the 20 cities that best represent the world of tomorrow emphasizing Mannheim's positive economic and innovative environment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theneweconomy.com/technology/the-rise-of-the-smart-city|title=The rise of the smart city|publisher=The New Economy|accessdate=2014-03-23[/tpl]
The city's tourism slogan is "Leben. Im Quadrat." (Live. In the Square.). The civic symbol of Mannheim is der Wasserturm, a Romanesque water tower completed in 1886 that rises to 60 metres above the highest point of the are nouveau area Friedrichsplatz.

Christoph Willibald Ritter von Gluck ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈkʁɪstɔf ˈvɪlɪbalt ˈɡlʊk[/tpl]; 2 July 1714 – 15 November 1787) was an opera composer of the early classical period. After many years at the Habsburg court at Vienna, Gluck brought about the practical reform of opera's dramaturgical practices that many intellectuals had been campaigning for over the years. With a series of radical new works in the 1760s, among them Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste, he broke the stranglehold that Metastasian opera seria had enjoyed for much of the century.
The strong influence of French opera in these works encouraged Gluck to move to Paris, which he did in November 1773. Fusing the traditions of Italian opera and the French national genre into a new synthesis, Gluck wrote eight operas for the Parisian stages. One of the last of these, Iphigénie en Tauride, was a great success and is generally acknowledged to be his finest work. Though he was extremely popular and widely credited with bringing about a revolution in French opera, Gluck's mastery of the Parisian operatic scene was never absolute, and after the poor reception of his Echo et Narcisse he left Paris in disgust and returned to Vienna to live out the remainder of his life.

Postcodes have been adopted for a wide range of purposes in addition to aiding the automated sorting of the mail: for calculating insurance premiums, designating destinations in route planning software, and as the lowest level of aggregation in census enumeration. Postcode data is stored, maintained and periodically updated in the Postcode Address File database, with the full address data for around 29 million delivery points.
An earlier system of postal districts was implemented in London and other large cities from 1857. In London this system was refined in 1917 to include numbered subdivisions, extending to the other cities in 1934. These earlier districts were later incorporated into the national postcode system.

[[Creative destruction]]

Creative destruction (German: schöpferische Zerstörung) , sometimes known as Schumpeter's gale, is a term in economics which has since the 1950s become most readily identified with the Austrian American economist Joseph Schumpeter's theory of economic innovation and business cycle. 
Creative destruction describes the "process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one."
The German Marxist sociologist Werner Sombart has been credited[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/j0g1348m35327v04/ | first1 = Hugo | last1 = Reinert | first2 = Erik S. | last2 = Reinert | title = Creative Destruction in Economics: Nietzsche, Sombart, Schumpeter | year = 2006 | postscript =, Word document[/tpl] with the first use of these terms in his work Krieg und Kapitalismus ("War and Capitalism", 1913).[ref] describes the way in which the destruction of forests in Europe laid the foundations for nineteenth-century capitalism, Sombart writes: "Wiederum aber steigt aus der Zerstörung neuer schöpferischer Geist empor" ("Again, however, from destruction a new spirit of creation arises"). 
[/ref] In the earlier work of Marx, however, the idea of creative destruction or annihilation (German: Vernichtung) implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders, but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth (whether through war, dereliction, or regular and periodic economic crises) in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth.
In Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942), Joseph Schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of Marx’s thought (to which the whole of Part I of the book is devoted), arguing (in Part II) that the creative-destructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system (see below). Despite this, the term subsequently gained popularity within free-market economics as a description of processes such as downsizing in order to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company. The Marxian usage has, however, been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as David Harvey, Marshall Berman, and Manuel Castells.

Cratippus ([tpl]lang-grc|Κράτιππος[/tpl]; fl. c. 375 BC), was a Greek historian. There are only three or four references to him in ancient literature, and his importance derives from his being identified by several scholars (e.g. Blass) with the author of the historical fragment discovered by Grenfell and Hunt. The fragment itself was published in Oxyrhynchus Papyri, vol. v, and is known as the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia. It may be regarded as a fairly certain inference from a passage in Plutarch ([tpl]lang|la|De Gloria Atheniensium[/tpl], p. 345 E, ed. Bernardakis, ii. p. 455) that he was an Athenian writer, intermediate in date between  Thucydides and Xenophon, and that his work continued the narrative of Thucydides, from the point at which the latter historian stopped (410 BC) down to the Battle of Cnidus.

Friedrich Blass (22 January 1843, Osnabrück – 5 March 1907, Halle) was a German classical scholar.
After studying at Göttingen and Bonn from 1860 to 1863, he lectured at several gymnasia and at the University of Königsberg. In 1876 he was appointed extraordinary professor of classical philology at Kiel, and ordinary professor in 1881. In 1892 he accepted a professorship at Halle, where he later died.
He frequently visited England, and was intimately acquainted with leading British scholars. He received an honorary degree from Dublin University in 1892, and his readiness to place the results of his labours at the disposal of others, together with the courtesy and kindliness of his disposition, won the respect of all who knew him.
Blass is chiefly known for his works in connection with the study of Greek oratory: Die griechische Beredsamkeit von Alexander bis auf Augustus (1865); Die attische Beredsamkeit (1868–1880; 2nd ed., 1887–1898), his greatest work; editions for the Teubner series of Andocides (1880), Antiphon (1881), Hypereides (1881, 1894), Demosthenes (Dindorf's ed., 1885), Isocrates (1886), Dinarchus (1888), Demosthenes (Rehdantz ed., 1893), Aeschines (1896), Lycurgus, Leocrates (1902); Die Rhythmen der attischen Kunstprosa (1901); Die Rhythmen der asianischen und römischen Kunstprosa (1905).  He published an enlarged edition of Kuhner's Greek Grammar (1890–1904).   
Among his other works are editions of Eudoxus of Cnidus (1887), the Ἀθηναίων πολιτεία (4th ed., 1903), a work of great importance, and Bacchylides (3rd. ed., 1904); Grammatik des neutestamentlichen Griechisch (1902; Eng. trans. by H St John Thackeray, 1905); Hermeneuisik und Kritik and Paläographie, Buchwesen, und Handschriftenkunde (vol. i. of Müller's Handbuch der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, 1891); Über die Aussprache des Griechischen (1888; Eng. trans. by W. J. Purton, 1890); Die Interpolationen in der Odyssee (1904); contributions to Collitz's Sammlung der griechischen Dialektinschriften; editions of the texts of certain portions of the New Testament (Gospels and Acts).

It is the largest town of Babergh district council, the local government district, and is represented in the UK Parliament as part of the South Suffolk constituency.
Evidence of Sudbury as a settlement originates from the end of the 8th century during the Anglo-Saxon era, and its market was established in the early 11th century. Its textile industries prospered during the Late Middle Ages; the wealth of which funded many of its buildings and churches. The town became notable for its art in the 18th century, being the birthplace of Thomas Gainsborough, whose landscapes offered inspiration to John Constable, another Suffolk painter of the surrounding Stour Valley area. The 19th century saw the arrival of the railway with the opening of a station on the historic Stour Valley Railway, and Sudbury railway station forms the current terminus of the Gainsborough Line. During World War II, US Army Airforce bombers operated from RAF Sudbury.
Today, Sudbury retains its status as a market town with a twice-weekly market in the town centre in front of the redundant St Peter's Church, which is now a local community point for events such as concerts and exhibitions. In sport, the town has a semi-professional football club, A.F.C. Sudbury, which competes at the eighth level of the football pyramid.

It is governed as the Walloon Region, which makes up 55% of the territory of Belgium but with only a third of its population. Contrary to the situation in Flanders, the Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium, a political level responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education. The small German-speaking minority in the east forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues. The demonym for Wallonia is Walloon.
During the industrial revolution, Wallonia was second only to the United Kingdom in industrialization, capitalizing on its extensive deposits of coal and iron. This brought the region wealth, and, from the beginning of the 19th to the middle of the 20th centuries, Wallonia was the more prosperous half of Belgium. Since World War II the importance of heavy industry has greatly declined, and the Flemish Region surpassed Wallonia in wealth as Wallonia economically declined. Wallonia now suffers from high unemployment and has a significantly lower GDP per capita than Flanders. The economic inequalities and linguistic divide between the two are major sources of political conflict in Belgium.
The capital of Wallonia is Namur, and its largest metropolitan area is Liège, while its most populous municipality proper is Charleroi. Most of Wallonia's major cities and two-thirds of its population lie along the Sambre and Meuse valley, the former industrial backbone of Belgium. To the north lies the Central Belgian Plateau, which, like Flanders, is relatively flat and agriculturally fertile. In the southeast lie the Ardennes; the area is sparsely populated and mountainous. Wallonia borders Flanders and the Netherlands in the north, France to the south and west, and Germany and Luxembourg to the east.

Ranworth Broad is an expanse of water lying in the valley of the River Bure in Norfolk, England. Like other broads, it is believed to have been formed by the flooding of mediaeval peat workings. Joined to neighbouring Malthouse Broad by a narrow channel,Page, Mike: A Broads-Eye View, Halsgrove 2005 p21, p84 it is one of the nature reserves in the care of the Norfolk Wildlife Trust.[ref]

The reserve consists of three hectares of open water, wet grassland, alder carr (wet woodland) and scrub; it has a floating visitor centre, a boardwalk and a bird observation hide. The broad is a short distance from the village of Ranworth and is overlooked by the tower of the parish church of St. Helen. A traditional reed lighter (a vessel used to transport reeds, harvested for use as thatch) called the 'Helen' now ferries visitors between Ranworth Broad and Malthouse Broad.
The poet and critic Edward Thomas spent a holiday on a houseboat on Ranworth Broad with his son and a group of friends in the summer of 1913 at the invitation of the poet and writer Eleanor Farjeon, while Thomas's wife Helen was in Switzerland.Hollis, Matthew: Now All Roads Lead to France - The Last Years of Edward Thomas, Faber & Faber 2011

It is a National Nature Reserve established by English Nature and in the care of the Norfolk Wildlife Trust, who run boat trips around the reserve for visitors. It is also part of the Upper Thurne Broads and Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest. In the 1990s, over £650,000 was spent on restoring the reserve, and invasive plants are kept under control by grazing hardy breeds of cattle, sheep and ponies from Eastern Europe. Water levels are managed, and the reed and sedge beds are regularly mown to encourage wildlife.Norfolk Wildlife Trust, Hickling Broad NNR, accessed 2010-03-13 
It is the broad with the largest surface area, and the water is slightly brackish, due to its proximity to the sea. The navigation channel is only 1.5 m deep, with much of the broad being shallower; it is 1.4 km², making it one of the largest expanses of open water in East Anglia.
It has the largest reed-bed in England and supports rare waterweeds such as the holly-leaved naiad and three rare species of stonewort. Amongst the rare insects is the Swallowtail Butterfly which feeds on milk-parsley, the Norfolk hawker Aeshna isosceles and emperor dragonfly. Birds that visit the reserve during the winter include cranes, goldeneyes, shovelers and teals, while bitterns, marsh harriers, pochards, water rails and Cetti’s warblers stay for most of the year. There is a waymarked walk around the broad.
Pioneering photographer Emma Turner, lived at Hickling and photographed birds there in the early 20th century.

[[Norbert Zongo]]

Norbert Zongo (July 1949 – December 13, 1998) was the publisher and editor of the Burkina Faso newspaper l'Indépendant. He was assassinated after his newspaper began investigating the murder of a driver who had worked for the brother of President Blaise Compaoré.
On December 13, 1998, Zongo's burnt body was found along with bodies of his brother Ernest Zongo, chauffeur Ablasse Nikiema, and Blaise Ilboudo, in a vehicle near Sapouy, some 100 kilometers south of the capital city of Ouagadougou. An Independent Commission of Inquiry later concluded that Norbert Zongo was killed for purely political reasons because of his investigative work into the death of President Blaise Compaoré's brother Francois's driver, David Ouedraogo.
In January 1999, Francois Compaoré, President Blaise Compaoré's brother, was charged with murder and harbouring the body of the victim in connection with the death of David Ouedraogo, his chauffeur, who had died as a result of torture in January 1998. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after Francois Compaoré appealed against them.
In August 2000, five members of the presidential security were charged for the murder of Ouedraogo. Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama and Ousseini Yaro, who are also suspects in the Norbert Zongo case, were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Edmond Koama died on January 4, 2001.
The singer Alpha Blondy wrote a song, "Journalistes en danger", about the assassination of Norbert Zongo.
On July 19, 2006, charges were dropped against the only person charged in the Zongo case, Marcel Kafando. This judgment has been called "scandalous" by Reporters Without Borders.
Zongo is the author of a novel that has been translated into English and is entitled The Parachute Drop, published by Africa World Press in 2004. Samples of his journalism have been translated into English and may be found assembled in an articled entitled "The Mobutuization of Burkina Faso," in The Desert Shore: Literatures of the Sahel, edited by Christopher Wise (Boulder, Colorado: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2001).
In 2012, a memorial has been erected at the Highway N6 (Ouagadougou - Léo) near Sapouy, exactly at the place, where Zongo has been murdered.

[[Maruts]]

CATEGORIES: Rigvedic deities, Hindu gods, Sky and weather gods

In Hinduism the Marutas ([tpl]Lang-sa|मरुत[/tpl]), also known as the Marutagana and sometimes identified with Rudras, are  storm deities and sons of Rudra and Prisni and attendants of Indra, an ancient Vedic deity who later came to be identified with Shiva.  The number of Marutas varies from 27 to sixty (three times sixty in RV 8.96.8).  They are very violent and aggressive,  described as armed with golden weapons i.e. lightning and thunderbolts, as having iron teeth and roaring like lions, as residing in the north, as riding in golden chariots drawn by ruddy horses.
Hymn 66 of Mandala VI of the Rig Veda is an eloquent account of how a natural phenomenon of a rain-storm metamorphose into storm deities.http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/the-birth-of-the-maruts/
In the Vedic mythology, the Marutas, a troop of young warriors, are Indra's companions. According to French comparative mythologist Georges Dumézil, they are cognate to the Einherjar and the Wild hunt.
According to the Rig Veda, the ancient collection of sacred hymns, they wore golden helmets and breastplates, and used their axes to split the clouds so that rain could fall.  They were widely regarded as clouds, capable to shaking mountains and destroying forests.  
According to later tradition, the Marutas were born from the broken womb of the goddess Diti, after Indra hurled a thunderbolt at her to prevent her from giving birth to too powerful a son.  The goddess had intended to remain pregnant for a century before giving birth to a son who would threaten Indra.

The Hindu god Shiva shares several features with the Rudra: the theonym Shiva originated as an epithet of Rudra, the adjective shiva ("kind") being used euphemistically of Rudra, who also carries the epithet ghora ("extremly terrifying"). Usage of the epithet came to exceed the original theonym by the post-Vedic period (in the Sanskrit Epics), and the name Rudra has been taken as a synonym for the god Shiva and the two names are used interchangeably.

[[Diti]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu goddesses, Earth goddesses

In Hinduism, Diti ([tpl]lang-sa|दिति[/tpl]) is an earth goddess and mother of the Maruts with Rudra. She is also the mother of the Daityas with the sage Kashyapa. She wanted to have a son who would be more powerful than Indra (who had killed her previous children) and so she practiced magic and kept herself pregnant for one year.Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 6 Chapter 18 Verse 45  Indra used a thunderbolt to splinter the fetus into many pieces, the Maruts. She is also Aditi's sister. Diti is the daughter of Daksha-Prajapati one of the grandfather's of creation, a son of Brahma, the god of ritual skill and a king. Her mother was Veerni. She is one of the sixty daughters of Daksha. She is one of the thirteen wives of Kashyapa, another prajapati and a great sage. She has many demon sons and daughters. Her two most famous sons were the rebirths of Vishnu's gatekeepers Jaya and Vijaya who failed to keep their dharma. They were Hiranyaksha who was slain by Vishnu's varaha avatara and Hiranyakashipu who was slain by Vishnu's man-lion, narasimha avatara. She also had a daughter named Holika who was killed by her own powers. Diti is usually mean and cruel to Kashyapa and Aditi. She is always obsessed with trying to raise the power of demons to its peak. She also hates Aditi's sons who are the gods.

CATEGORIES: Non-human races in Hindu mythology, Muses, Apsara

An Apsara (also spelled as Apsarasa) is a female spirit of the clouds and waters in Hindu and Buddhist mythology.
An Apsara (Sanskrit: अप्सराः [tpl]IAST|apsarāḥ[/tpl], plural अप्सरसः [tpl]IAST|apsarasaḥ[/tpl], stem apsaras-, a feminine consonant stem, អប្សរា), is also known as Vidhya Dhari or Tep Apsar (ទេពអប្សរ) in Khmer, Accharā (Pāli) or A Bố Sa La Tư (Vietnamese), Bidadari (Indonesian & Malay), Biraddali  (Tausug), Hapsari or Widodari (Javanese) and Apson ([tpl]lang-th|อัปสร[/tpl]). English translations of the word "Apsara" include "nymph," "celestial nymph," and "celestial maiden."
Apsaras are beautiful, supernatural female beings. They are youthful and elegant, and superb in the art of dancing. They are often the wives of the Gandharvas, the court musicians of Indra. They dance to the music made by the Gandharvas, usually in the palaces of the gods, entertain and sometimes seduce gods and men. As ethereal beings who inhabit the skies, and are often depicted taking flight, or at service of a god, they may be compared to angels.
Apsaras are said to be able to change their shape at will, and rule over the fortunes of gaming and gambling. Urvasi, Menaka, Rambha and Tilottama are the most famous among them. Apsaras are sometimes compared to the muses of ancient Greece, with each of the 26 Apsaras at Indra's court representing a distinct aspect of the performing arts. They are associated with fertility rites. 
There are two types of Apsaras; Laukika (worldly), of whom thirty-four are specified, and Daivika (divine), of which there are ten.
The Bhagavata Purana also states that the Apsaras were born from Kashyap and Muni.

Surveyor 6 was the sixth lunar lander of the American unmanned Surveyor program that reached the surface of the Moon. Surveyor 6 landed on the Sinus Medii. A total of 30,027 images were transmitted to Earth.
This spacecraft was the fourth of the Surveyor series to successfully achieve a soft landing on the moon, obtain post landing television pictures, determine the abundance of the chemical elements in the lunar soil, obtain touchdown dynamics data, obtain thermal and radar reflectivity data, and conduct a Vernier engine erosion experiment. Virtually identical to Surveyor 5, this spacecraft carried a television camera, a small bar magnet attached to one footpad, and an alpha-scattering instrument as well as the necessary engineering equipment. It landed on November 10, 1967, in Sinus Medii, 0.49 deg in latitude and 1.40 deg w longitude (selenographic coordinates) - the center of the moon's visible hemisphere. The spacecraft accomplished all planned objectives. The successful completion of this mission satisfied the Surveyor program's obligation to the Apollo project. On November 24, 1967, the spacecraft was shut down for the two-week lunar night. Contact was made on December 14, 1967, but no useful data was obtained.
Lunar soil surveys were completed using photographic and alpha particle backscattering methods. A similar instrument, the APXS, was used onboard several Mars missions. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In a further test of space technology, Surveyor 6's engines were restarted and burned for 2.5 seconds in the first Lunar liftoff on November 17 at 10:32 UTC. This created 150 lbf (700 N) of thrust and lifted the vehicle 12 feet (4 m) from the lunar surface. After moving west 8 feet, (2.5 m) the spacecraft once again successfully soft landed and continued functioning as designed.

Canticle of the Plains is a musical written by songwriters Rich Mullins, Mitch McVicker, and Beaker which is based on the life of St. Francis of Assisi.
The story centers on a character named Frank, a nineteenth-century cowboy, and his travels through the Midwest after returning home from fighting in the Civil War. Frank then meets Buzz, a former slave, in a burned out church in Lawrence, Kansas and Ivory, in a saloon. Frank also runs into a childhood friend in the saloon, named Clare. Frank, Buzz and Ivory set out in search of the imaginary land of Dineh Bekeya.
In 1996, a soundtrack album was recorded, featuring Mitch McVicker as Frank, Leigh Bingham Nash from Sixpence None the Richer as Clare, Kevin Max as Ivory and Michael Tait as Buzz.
By 1997, the musical had been performed in its draft form at a variety of locations including The Cornerstone Festival.
At the time of his death, Mullins was in production for the official world première.  He had asked Kevin Brocksieck http://www.AlmightyFear.com and Nicole Capri (of Tapestry Performing Arts) to rewrite the script and produce the show, set to première October 11 with McVicker in the leading role of Frank.  After his death, Mullins' board and family asked that the première go on as planned with Brocksieck moving into the leading role (due to McVicker's extensive injuries from the September 19 crash).  The première was directed by Nicole Capri with musical direction by Kevin Brocksieck.

[[Rishi]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu sages, Titles and occupations in Hinduism

The term Rishi ([tpl]lang-sa|ṛṣi[/tpl], Devanagari: ऋषि) originates from the Vedic period.  Rishis were the scribes of the large body of nature hymns and spiritual science known as the Vedas.
A Rishi (or rishika, when referring to female rishis) is a sage of insight, one who practices self-cultivation as a Yogini or Yogi and attains nirvikalpa Samadhi. Through Yogic concentration a person first attains savikalpa samadhi (realisation of the independence of soul and body, Atma and Prakriti), and with continued effort attains nirvikalpa samadhi (realisation of oneness with all). The Rishi's soul is considered to imbibe wisdom directly from the universal source.  Vedic hymns are sermons conceived as delivered by divine inspiration by the rishis.
In popular tradition, it is said that a Rishi never contradicts another Rishi because their knowledge is directly revealed by God.

In chemistry, the sulfonamide functional group (also spelt sulphonamide) is -S(=O)2-NH2, a sulfonyl group connected to an amine group.
A sulfonamide (compound) is a compound that contains this group. The general formula is RSO2NH2, where R is some organic group. For example, "methanesulfonamide" is CH3SO2NH2. Any sulfonamide can be considered as derived from a sulfonic acid by replacing a hydroxyl group with an amine group.
In medicine, the term "sulfonamide" is sometimes used as a synonym for sulfa drug, a derivative or variation of sulfanilamide.

[[Blueprint]]
CATEGORIES: 1840 introductions, Non-impact printing, Infographics, Publications by format

A blueprint is a reproduction of a technical drawing, documenting an architecture or an engineering design, using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets. Introduced in the 19th century, the process allowed rapid and accurate reproduction of documents used in construction and industry. The blue-print process was characterized by light colored lines on a blue background, a negative of the original. The process was unable to reproduce color or shades of grey. 
Various base materials have been used for blueprints.  Paper was a common choice; for more durable prints linen was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly.  To combat this problem, printing on imitation vellum and, later, polyester film (Mylar) was implemented.
The process has been largely displaced by the diazo whiteprint process and by large-format xerographic photocopiers, so reproduced drawings are usually called "prints" or just "drawings".
The term blueprint is also used less formally to refer to any plan.[tpl]ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary[/tpl]

Coyote and The Road Runner

Wile E. Coyote (also known simply as "The Coyote") and The Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from a series of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. The characters (a coyote and Greater Roadrunner) were created by animation director Chuck Jones in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-television cartoons.
In each episode, instead of animal senses and cunning, Wile E. Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) and elaborate plans to pursue his quarry. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons like Tom and Jerry, but became popular in its own right.
The Coyote appears separately as an occasional antagonist of Bugs Bunny in five shorts from 1952 to 1963: Operation: Rabbit, To Hare Is Human, Rabbit's Feat, Compressed Hare, and Hare-Breadth Hurry. While he is generally silent in the Coyote-Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined accent in these solo outings (except for Hare-Breadth Hurry), introducing himself as "Wile E. Coyote — super genius", voiced with an upper-class accent by Mel Blanc.[tpl]cite news |first=Peter |last=Flint |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mel Blanc, Who Provided Voices For 3,000 Cartoons, Is Dead at 81  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D7143EF932A25754C0A96F948260 |work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=July 11, 1989 |accessdate= December 1, 2007 [/tpl] The Road Runner vocalizes only with a signature sound, "Meep, Meep", recorded by Paul Julian, and an occasional "popping-cork" tongue noise.The interviews included in the DVD commentary were recorded by animation historian Michael Barrier for his book Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age.

[[Quarter days]]

CATEGORIES: British culture, Calendars, Holidays in Scotland, Public holidays in the United Kingdom, Quarter days

In British and Irish tradition, the quarter days were the four dates in each year on which servants were hired, and rents were due. They fell on four religious festivals roughly three months apart and close to the two solstices and two equinoxes.
The significance of quarter days is now limited, although leasehold payments and rents for land and premises in England are often still due on the old English quarter days.
The quarter days have been observed at least since the Middle Ages, and they ensured that debts and unresolved lawsuits were not allowed to linger on. Accounts had to be settled, a reckoning had to be made and publicly recorded on the quarter days.Clines, David J. A. (1998).

In the western liturgical year, Lady Day is the traditional name of the Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin (25 March) in some English-speaking countries. It is the first of the four traditional English quarter days. The "Lady" is the Virgin Mary. The term derives from Middle English, when some nouns lost their genitive inflections. "Lady" would later gain an -s genitive ending, and therefore the name means "Lady's day".

A few species are used as medicinal plants, known as sources for quinine and other compounds.
The name of the genus is due to Carolus "Carl" Linnaeus, who named the tree in 1742 after the Second Countess of Chinchón, the wife of a viceroy of Peru, who, in 1638 (according to accounts at the time, now disparaged) was introduced by native Quechua healers to the medicinal properties of cinchona bark.

Michaelmas, the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel (also the Feast of Saints Michael, Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael, the Feast of the Archangels, or the Feast of Saint Michael and All Angels) is a day in the Western Christian calendar that occurs on 29 September. Because it falls near the equinox, it is associated in the northern hemisphere with the beginning of autumn and the shortening of days. In medieval England, Michaelmas marked the ending and beginning of the husbandman's year, George C. Homans observes: "at that time harvest was over, and the bailiff or reeve of the manor would be making out the accounts for the year."George C. Homans, English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century, 2nd ed. 1991:354.

Michaelmas has also delineated time and seasons for secular purposes as well, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland as one of the quarter days.
The Eastern Orthodox Churches do not observe Michaelmas. The Greek Orthodox honor the archangels on 8 November instead.

Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is the name used in the UK for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the seventh Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2). In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, the beginning of the summer half-year, in Europe.[tpl]cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Prudence|last2=Pennick|first2=Nigel|title=A history of pagan Europe|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vYtrv5qD9isC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+history+of+pagan+europe&cd=1#v=onepage&q=whitsun&f=false|accessdate=25 May 2010|date=20 February 1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-15804-4|page=124[/tpl] Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein;The others being Yuletide, the week following Christmas, and Easter Week, the week following Easter that ended at Hocktide (Homans 1991). on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year.George C.

Talbot was also a noted photographer who made major contributions to the development of photography as an artistic medium. His work in the 1840s on photo-mechanical reproduction led to the creation of the photoglyphic engraving process, the precursor to photogravure. Talbot is also remembered as the holder of a patent which, some say, affected the early development of commercial photography in Britain.

Dexter's Laboratory (commonly abbreviated as Dexter's Lab) is an American comic science fiction animated children's television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network. The series follows Dexter, a boy-genius with a secret laboratory filled with his inventions. He constantly battles his sister Dee Dee, who always gains access despite his best efforts to keep her out, as well as his arch-rival and neighbor, Mandark. The series' first two seasons contain additional segments: Dial M for Monkey, which focuses on Dexter's pet lab-monkey-turned-superhero, and The Justice Friends, about a trio of superheroes who share an apartment.
Tartakovsky first pitched the series to Hanna-Barbera's animated shorts showcase World Premiere Toons, basing it on student films he produced while attending the California Institute of the Arts. A pilot aired on Cartoon Network in February 1995, and in August viewer approval ratings convinced the network to order a half-hour series, which premiered on April 27, 1996. By 1999, 52 episodes and a television movie had been produced, and Tartakovsky then left the series to begin work on his other projects, Samurai Jack and Star Wars: Clone Wars. In 2001, the network revived the series under a different production team at Cartoon Network Studios, and after 26 more episodes, the series ended on November 20, 2003.
Dexter's Laboratory received high ratings and became one of Cartoon Network's most popular and successful original series.

It was the family home of Christopher Boardman  who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics, winning gold in sailing. As gold medallist he was presented with an oak sapling which he planted at How Hill.BBC news report- 1936 Olympics oak tree His younger brother, Humphrey, rowed in the double sculls at the 1928 Olympic games and won double gold at the 1930 British Empire Games. Their father, Edward Thomas Boardman, was a Norwich architect, and their mother, Florence, was a daughter of J J Colman of the Colman's Mustard family.
The large Edwardian building houses the Norfolk Broads Study Centre, an independent charitable organisation which runs residential environmental courses for groups of schoolchildren. The How Hill Nature Reserve is administered by the Broads Authority. The "Electric Eel" is an electric passenger boat on which visitors can take a trip through the maze of reed-fringed dykes, normally not accessible to the public.

Route 23 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States. The route runs [tpl]convert|52.63|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from County Route 506 (Bloomfield Avenue) and County Route 577 (Prospect Avenue) in Verona, Essex County northwest to the border with New York at Montague Township in Sussex County, where the road continues to Port Jervis, New York as Orange County Route 15. Route 23 heads through Essex and Passaic Counties as a suburban arterial varying from two to four lanes and becomes a six-lane freeway north of a complex interchange with U.S. Route 46 and Interstate 80 in Wayne. The freeway carries Route 23 north to a concurrency with U.S. Route 202. Past the freeway portion, the route heads northwest along the border of Morris and Passaic Counties as a four- to six-lane divided highway with a wide median at places, winding through mountainous areas and crossing Interstate 287 in Riverdale. The route continues northwest through Sussex County as a mostly two-lane, undivided road that passes through farmland and woodland as well as the communities of Franklin, Hamburg, and Sussex before reaching the New York border just south of an interchange with Interstate 84 near High Point State Park.
Route 23 was established in 1927 to run from Verona to the New York border near Port Jervis, replacing pre-1927 Route 8 between Verona and Sussex. The route followed two turnpikes that were created in the early 19th century: the Newark-Pompton Turnpike and the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike. In the mid-1950s, there were plans to build an Interstate Highway along Route 23 between Interstate 80 and Interstate 287, but it was never built. In the 1960s, the route was planned to be upgraded to a freeway all the way up to Port Jervis and south to Piscataway, Middlesex County; however, both freeway proposals were cancelled in the early 1970s. In the mid-1980s, the portion of Route 23 from north of U.S. Route 46 in Wayne to Interstate 287 in Riverdale was improved, with the road upgraded to a six-lane freeway south of the Alps Road intersection and to a six-lane surface road north of Alps Road.

Route 24 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States, that extends [tpl]convert|10.42|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from a junction with Interstate 287 in Hanover Township in Morris County, passing southeast through Essex County, and ends at a junction with Interstate 78 in Springfield Township in Union County. The route is a four- to six-lane freeway its entire length.
The route was created in 1927 to run from Phillipsburg to Newark, replacing pre-1927 Route 12 from Phillipsburg to Penwell and Pre-1927 Route 5 from Morristown to Newark. The route was extended west to the new Easton–Phillipsburg Toll Bridge in 1938 but was cut back to U.S. Route 22 in the eastern part of Phillipsburg in 1953. The western terminus was cut back further around 1970 to Hackettstown with the route west of there becoming part of Route 57. The freeway alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and Interstate 78 was completed in 1972.
With the completion of this freeway, Route 24 east of the John F. Kennedy Parkway became Route 124. The freeway was completed between the abandoned Tri-Borough Road interchange and the JFK Parkway in the 1970s but was not opened until 1992, when the rest of the freeway to Interstate 287 was completed after years of legal, environmental and budgetary problems. At this time, the alignment of Route 24 between U.S. Route 202 in Morristown and the JFK Parkway became a western extension of Route 124 while the route was officially eliminated between Hackettstown and Morristown as it followed county-maintained routes. The former route between Hackettstown and Morristown is still referred to as Route 24 by many and is still signed as such due to local outcry.

[[New Jersey Route 29]]
CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Transportation in Mercer County, New Jersey, Trenton, New Jersey, Limited-access roads in New Jersey, National Scenic Byways

Route 29 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs [tpl]convert|34.76|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from an intersection with Interstate 295 in Hamilton Township in Mercer County, where it continues as Interstate 195, to Route 12 (Bridge Street / Race Street) in Frenchtown, Hunterdon County. Between the southern terminus and Interstate 95, the route is a mix of freeway and four-lane divided highway that runs along the Delaware River through Trenton.  This section includes a truck-restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and Riverview Cemetery. North of Interstate 95, Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two-lane highway. North of the South Trenton Tunnel, it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway, that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and Hunterdon County. The obsolete Delaware & Raritan Canal usually stands between the river and the highway. Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely shaded due to the tree canopy. Route 29 also has a spur, Route 129, which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 in Trenton.
Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown Trenton to Newark, following present-day Route 179 and U.S. Route 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and U.S. Route 22 between Somerville and Newark. The route between Lambertville and Frenchtown was originally Route 29A. In 1953, Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route 29A to avoid the concurrencies with the U.S. Routes. Route 29 between South Warren Street in Trenton and Interstate 95 in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four-lane highway, with a portion of freeway, in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1995, the southern freeway part of Route 29 between Interstate 195/Interstate 295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed. This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002.  A realignment of Route 29 in Lambertville by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of [tpl]convert|0.26|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] long Route 165.

Prior to the 1953 renumbering, the route continued southwest along US 1 to Trenton. Livingston Avenue inside New Brunswick, southwest of Suydam Street, is the [tpl]convert|1.08|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] County Route 691 (CR 691). The [tpl]convert|0.39|mi|km[/tpl] from Suydam Street to its end at George Street is part of State Route 171, also maintained by Middlesex County.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000171__-.pdf|title=Route 171 straight line diagram|format=PDF|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|accessdate=November 20, 2009|pages=1–2[/tpl]
Route 26 originates as the alignment of the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, chartered in 1803 from Warren and Green Streets in Trenton to New Brunswick. The turnpike lasted for 99 years, fighting with railroads, canals and stagecoaches to stay in business. The road was designated State Highway Route 26 in the 1927 state highway renumbering, running from the state line in Trenton to State Highway Route S-28 in New Brunswick along the turnpike and Livingston Avenue. The route remained intact, becoming part of an engineering feat meant for the safety of drivers. In 1952, the route became part of the Trenton Freeway until the Route 26 designation was truncated back to North Brunswick Township in the 1953 state highway renumbering. The route was further truncated back from Route 18 in the 1970s in New Brunswick to its current northern terminus at Nassau Street.

[[Counting sort]]

CATEGORIES: Sorting algorithms, Stable sorts

In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently.[ref]
. See also the historical notes on page 181.</ref><ref name="edmonds">[tpl]citation|first=Jeff|last=Edmonds|contribution=5.2 Counting Sort (a Stable Sort)|pages=72–75|title=How to Think about Algorithms|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-84931-9[/tpl].</ref><ref name="sedgewick">[tpl]citation|first=Robert|last=Sedgewick|authorlink=Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|contribution=6.10 Key-Indexed Counting|title=Algorithms in Java, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, and Searching|edition=3rd|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2003|pages=312–314[/tpl].</ref>
Because counting sort uses key values as indexes into an array, it is not a comparison sort, and the Ω(n log n) lower bound for comparison sorting does not apply to it. Bucket sort may be used for many of the same tasks as counting sort, with a similar time analysis; however, compared to counting sort, bucket sort requires linked lists, dynamic arrays or a large amount of preallocated memory to hold the sets of items within each bucket, whereas counting sort instead stores a single number (the count of items) per bucket.

Lunenburg is a Canadian port town in Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia. Situated on the province's South Shore, Lunenburg is located at the western side of Mahone Bay.  The town is approximately 90 kilometres southwest of the county boundary with the Halifax Regional Municipality.
The town was established during Father Le Loutre's War, four years after Halifax. The town was one of the first British attempts to settle Protestants in Nova Scotia and, as a result, the (Catholic) Wabanaki Confederacy raided the community nine times in the early years of the settlement.
The historic town was designated a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site in 1995. This designation ensures protection for much of Lunenburg's unique architecture and civic design, being the best example of planned British colonial settlement in Canada.

The broad has an area of 34.4 hectares and a mean depth of 1.3 metres. It lies to the west of the Bure, with two navigable openings between river and broad. The village and broad lie in an area of fairly intensive agriculture, with areas of wet woodland adjoining the broad and river.http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/ecnsites.asp?site=L03 [tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]

There is a locomotive at the Bure Valley Railway in Norfolk which is named after Wroxham Broad.
Between 2000 and 2005 the island between the two channels linking Wroxham Broad to the Bure underwent restoration to stop erosion and improve the island's ecology, which had become degraded. The project was a joint initiative involving the Broads Authority, Norfolk Broads Yacht Club and the local landowner, Trafford Estates. Scrub was cleared and a stretch of piling installed, allowing sedge, reed and rush to grow back. By 2005 it was reported that more birds, including kingfishers, were nesting on the island and the rare Cetti's warbler was often spotted. Greater numbers of ducks, including pochard and tufted ducks, now wintered nearby and there was a greater profusion of wild flowers and marsh flora including orchids. During the course of the work, in 2004, volunteers came across an unexploded Second World War hand grenade in the dredgings, which had to be exploded by an army bomb disposal team.Wroxham Broad island restored in innovative partnership project - Broads Authority

The Broads Authority is the agency which has statutory responsibility for the Broads in England. Originally, the Nature Conservancy Council (now Natural England), pressed for a special authority to manage the Broads which had been neglected for a long time. In 1978, the forerunner to the present-day Broads Authority was established by the Countryside Commission (now also Natural England). Ten years later, it had become clear that a statutory body was needed, and a special Act of Parliament, The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 (referred to as the Broads Act) made the Broads Authority into a Special Statutory Authority which gave it parity with national park authorities.

[[Generating set of a group]]
CATEGORIES: Group theory

In abstract algebra, a generating set of a group is a subset such that every element of the group can be expressed as the combination (under the group operation) of finitely many elements of the subset and their inverses.
In other words, if S is a subset of a group G, then , the subgroup generated by ''S, is the smallest subgroup of G containing every element of S, meaning the intersection over all subgroups containing the elements of S''; equivalently, <S> is the subgroup of all elements of G that can be expressed as the finite product of elements in S and their inverses.
If G = <S>, then we say S generates G; and the elements in S are called generators or group generators. If S is the empty set, then  is the trivial group {e}, since we consider the empty product to be the identity.
When there is only a single element x in S,  is usually written as . In this case,  is the cyclic subgroup of the powers of x, a cyclic group, and we say this group is generated by x. Equivalent to saying an element x generates a group is saying that  equals the entire group G. For finite groups, it is also equivalent to saying that
x has order |G|.

Historically, canoes were dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame,[tpl]cite web|title=Dugout Canoe|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/dugout-canoe|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=30 January 2013[/tpl] but construction materials evolved to canvas on a wood frame, then to aluminum. Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as Fiberglass. Until the mid-1800s the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade, but then transitioned to recreational or sporting use. Canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936.  In countries where the canoe played a key role in history, such as Canada and New Zealand, the canoe remains an important theme in popular culture.
Canoes can be adapted to many purposes, for example with the addition of sails, outboard motors, and outriggers.

Ernie Kovacs (January 23, 1919 – January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer.
Kovacs' uninhibited, often ad-libbed, and visually experimental comedic style came to influence numerous television comedy programs for years after his death in an automobile accident. Many iconic and diverse shows have been influenced by Kovacs, such as Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, The Uncle Floyd Show, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street,  The Electric Company, and TV hosts such as David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, and Craig Ferguson.[tpl]Cite news|author=O'Connor, John J.|title=TV View: Ernie Kovacs: A comic to the medium born|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DA173CF93BA35750C0A961948260|work=The New York Times|date=March 8, 1987|accessdate=January 7, 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGMOTqwJ|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|author=O'Connor, John J.|title=TV: Why Ernie Kovacs's humor grows with time|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2D91539F934A25752C1A964948260|work=The New York Times|date=November 17, 1982|accessdate=January 7, 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGMYfZr8|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Ernie Kovacs Phile |last=Walley |first=David G. |year=1987 |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc. |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-918282-06-4 |page=202[/tpl]Chevy Chase, "The Unique Comedy of Ernie Kovacs," TV Guide, April 9, 1977, pp. 39–40.[tpl]cite web|author=Visconage, Matt|title=Conan O'Brien and the Legacy of Ernie Kovacs|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/conan-obrien-and-the-legacy-of-ernie-kovacs/ |work=Splitsider |date=January 23, 2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Willmore, Alison |title=Take a Look at the Unappreciated Genius of TV Pioneer Ernie Kovacs |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/ernie-kovacs |work=Indiewire |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2013[/tpl] Chevy Chase acknowledged Kovacs' influence and thanked him during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live.Hofer, Stephen F.(2006).

The modern International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF), located in Canastota, New York, United States, honors boxers, trainers and other contributors to the sport worldwide. The International Boxing Hall of Fame is one of two recognized international boxing halls of fame, with the other being the World Boxing Hall of Fame.
The first Boxing Hall of Fame was sponsored by Ring magazine and located for decades at the offices of the Madison Square Garden in New York City. However, in 1990, as a consequence of an initiative by Ed Brophy to honor Canastota's world boxing champions, Carmen Basilio and Basilio's nephew, Billy Backus, the village of Canastota inaugurated the new museum, which showcases boxing's rich history. 1 Multi-award winning artist Richard T. Slone was named their official artist of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1997 and remains so to this day.
There are ceremonies conducted every year to honor the inductees and the ceremonies are attended by many former world boxing champions, boxing celebrities and Hollywood celebrities each year. Professional boxers have to wait five years after retirement to be eligible for election into the Hall of Fame. Inductions are handled by members of the Boxing Writers Association of America and an international panel of boxing historians. Each year inductees are selected in five different categories:

Herringfleet is a small village on the River Waveney, between Somerleyton and St. Olaves in Suffolk, England within The Broads National Park.
Herringfleet was occupied by the Roman Empire, and archaeologists have made a number of finds, including a Roman bronze 'patera', a 'soup ladle' vessel with the maker's name 'Quattenus' on the handle, and a Roman nether mill-stone of trachyte, originally imported from Saxony or Koblenz on the Rhine.
In the Middle Ages, Herringfleet was governed by the St Olaves Priory. Herringfleet is known for its Norman church, built in several parts over the past millennia. Its round tower is indicative of many East Anglian churches dating from the period. The church includes a nave and chancel. The whole edifice is of  Norman architecture, though considerable alterations have been made. The tower retains most of its original features, and has in the upper story wide windows of two lights, which are triangular-headed.[tpl]cite book|author=England|title=The ecclesiastical and architectural topography of England.

Breydon Water is a large stretch of sheltered estuary at Great Yarmouth in the English county of Norfolk. It is at the gateway to the The Broads river system on the eastern edge of Halvergate Marshes. It is the UK's largest protected wetland. It is 5 km long and more than 1.5 km wide in places. 
Breydon Water is overlooked at the southern end by the remains of the Roman fort at Burgh Castle. Centuries ago, Breydon Water would have been one large estuary facing the sea. At the western end the water may be considered to start at the confluence of the River Yare and River Waveney; smaller sources including The Fleet flow in from the surrounding marshland. Safe passage for boats is indicated by red and green marker posts. Unlike most of the navigable waterways in the Norfolk Broads, Breydon Water is not subject to a speed limit.
At the east end of Breydon Water the river returns to a narrow channel, passing under Breydon Bridge after which it is joined by the River Bure then under Haven Bridge from where it is 4.4 km through the harbour into the North Sea.

The name "Otago" is an old southern Maori word whose North Island dialect equivalent is "Otakou", introduced to the south by Europeans in the 1840s.Peter Entwisle, Behold the Moon: The European Occupation of the Dunedin District 1770-1848, Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 1998 (ISBN 0-473-05591-0), appendix 1 pp.136-139. The exact meaning of the term is disputed, with common translations being "isolated village" and "place of red earth", the latter referring to the reddish-ochre clay which is common in the area around Dunedin. "Otago" is also the old name of the European settlement on the Otago Harbour, established by the Weller Brothers in 1831. The place later became the focus of the Otago Association, an offshoot of the Free Church of Scotland, notable for its high-minded adoption of the principle that ordinary people, not the landowner, should choose the ministers.
Major centres include Dunedin (the principal city), Oamaru (made famous by Janet Frame), Balclutha, Alexandra, and the major tourist centres Queenstown and Wanaka. Kaitangata in South Otago is a prominent source of coal. The Waitaki and Clutha rivers provide much of the country's hydroelectric power. Some parts of the area originally covered by Otago Province are now administered as part of Southland Region.
New Zealand's first university, the University of Otago, was founded in 1869 as the provincial university in Dunedin.

[[Military engineering]]
CATEGORIES: Engineering occupations, Combat support occupations, Land warfare, Military engineering

Military engineering is loosely defined as the art and practice of designing and building military works and maintaining lines of military transport and communications. This discipline of engineering is regarded as the oldest form of engineering and is also the precursor of the civil engineering discipline. The term civil engineering derived from the need of a separation between military and non-military engineering fields. While both of these disciplines of engineering are responsible for building the same types of projects, their environments differ. Civil engineers are responsible for the construction and maintenance of civil works projects that serve the domestic public while military engineers construct and maintain similar facilities that serve military servicemen on war-fronts. Military engineers are also responsible for logistics behind military tactics. Modern military engineering requires more than civil engineering techniques. In the 21st Century, military engineering also includes other engineering disciplines such as mechanical and electrical engineering techniques.[tpl]cite web|title=military engineering|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/382334/military-engineering|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc|accessdate=13 February 2013|year=2013[/tpl]
According to NATO, "Military Engineering is that engineer activity undertaken, regardless of component or service, to shape the physical operating environment.' Military Engineering incorporates support to manoeuvre and to the force as a whole, including military engineering functions such as engineer support to Force Protection, Counter - Improvised Explosive Devices, Environmental Protection, Engineer Intelligence and Military Search. Military Engineering does not encompass the activities undertaken by those 'engineers' who maintain, repair and operate vehicles, vessels, aircraft, weapon systems and equipment." [tpl]Cite book|title=MC 0560 "MILITARY COMMITTEE POLICY FOR MILITARY ENGINEERING"|author=NATO publication|date=1 April 2008|publisher=NATO[/tpl]
Military engineering is an important academic subject taught in military academies or schools of military engineering. The construction and demolition tasks related to military engineering are usually performed by military engineers including soldiers trained as sappers or pioneers.[tpl]Cite book|title=From Crossbow to H-bomb|author=Bernard Brodie, Fawn McKay Brodie|year=1973 |publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-20161-6[/tpl] In modern armies, soldiers trained to perform such tasks while well forward in battle and under fire are often called combat engineers.
In some countries, military engineers may also perform non-military construction tasks in peacetime such as flood control and river navigation works, but such activities do not fall within the scope of military engineering.

The Richmond Football Club, nicknamed The Tigers, is an Australian rules football club which competes in the Australian Football League (AFL).
Since joining the competition in 1908, Richmond has won ten premierships, the most recent victory being in 1980. This currently sees the club ranked sixth in terms of premierships won.
In recent times, unstable administration on and off the field has troubled Richmond, none more so than in 1990, when a large debt almost forced the club to fold. Richmond has since regained a strong financial position, but with the exception of finals appearances in 1995, 2001 and 2013, the club has underachieved on the field.
Since the club's inception in 1885, it has been based at the Punt Road Oval, formerly known as the Richmond Cricket Ground, just a few hundred metres to the east of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The Tigers have played their home games at the MCG since 1965. The club's training and administration headquarters are at the Punt Road Oval and from 2011 are called the ME Bank Centre.ME Bank buys naming rights to Tigerland | Herald Sun 23 December 2010. Retrieved 30 April 2013
Based in a traditionally working-class area, Richmond has long-standing rivalries with cross town Melbourne based clubs, Collingwood, Carlton and Essendon.
Over the years, many great players have represented Richmond. Some of these players have been recognised as being among Australian rules football's greatest players. Such players include Jack Dyer, Kevin Bartlett, Royce Hart, Francis Bourke, Ian Stewart, Matthew Richardson and Jack Titus.

Sargon II (Akkadian Šarru-ukin "he the god made firm the king", Arabic: [tpl]lang|arc|سرجون[/tpl]' reigned 722 – 705 BC) was an Assyrian king. Sargon II became the ruler of the Assyrian Empire in 722 BC after the death of Shalmaneser V. It is not clear whether he was the son of Tiglath-Pileser III or a usurper unrelated to the royal family. In his inscriptions, he styles himself as a new man, rarely referring to his predecessors; however he took the name Sharru-kinu ("true king"), after Sargon of Akkad — who had founded the first Semitic Empire in the region some 16 centuries earlier.Another "Sargon", a predecessor of Shamshi-Adad of the 18th century BC.

Wario was first designed by Hiroji Kiyotake, and is voiced by Charles Martinet, who also voices many other characters in the series.
Since his debut, Wario has become the protagonist and antihero of the Wario Land and WarioWare series, spanning handheld and console markets. In addition to appearances in spin-offs in the Mario series, he appears in cameos for Densetsu no Stafy 3 and Pilotwings 64. He has also been featured in other media such as the Super Mario Adventures graphic novel.

As one of the earlier three-dimensional (3D) platform games, Super Mario 64 is based on open world playability, degrees of freedom through all three axes in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of true 3D polygons as opposed to only two-dimensional (2D) sprites.  The game established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for 2D sidescrolling platformers. In the evolution from two dimensions to three, Super Mario 64 places an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, in addition to the occasional linear obstacle courses as in traditional platform games. While doing so, it still preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier Mario games.
The game has left a lasting impression on 3D game design, particularly notable for its use of a dynamic camera system and the implementation of its 360-degree analog control.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3135350 |title = The Essential 50 Part 36: Super Mario 64 | publisher=1UP.com| accessdate=October 21, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermario64/review.html?|archiveurl= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090307030507/http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermario64/review.html?|archivedate= 2009-03-07 |title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time | publisher=GameSpot| accessdate=July 3, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/091/091398p1.html | title=N64 Reader Tributes: Super Mario 64 | publisher=IGN| accessdate=October 21, 2006[/tpl] The title is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest and most revolutionary video games of all time.[tpl]cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2003/1-10.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqeaoEzJ| archivedate=2010-01-17| title=IGN's Top 100 Games| publisher=IGN| year=2003| accessdate=February 2, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqeao0AV| archivedate=2010-01-17| title=IGN's Top 100 Games| publisher=IGN| year=2005| accessdate=February 11, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65aWDgKEP| archivedate=2012-02-20| title=IGN's Top 100 Games of All Time| publisher=IGN| year=2007| accessdate=February 2, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| date= August 2001| title= Top 100 Games of All Time| journal= Game Informer| page= 36[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/specials/100games/1.html| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/65aWJH4fd| archivedate = 2012-02-20| title = The 100 Greatest Computer Games of All Time| publisher = Yahoo!

CATEGORIES: Gossip columnists, Journalism occupations, Tabloid journalism

[tpl]Wikinews|An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism[/tpl]A gossip columnist is someone who writes a gossip column in a newspaper or magazine, especially a gossip magazine. Gossip columns are material written in a light, informal style, which relates the gossip columnist's opinions about the personal lives or conduct of  celebrities from show business (motion picture movie stars, theater, and television actors), politicians, professional sports stars, and other wealthy people or public figures. Some gossip columnists broadcast segments on radio and television.
The columns mix factual material on arrests, divorces, marriages and pregnancies, obtained from official records, with more speculative gossip stories, rumors, and innuendo about romantic relationships, affairs, and purported personal problems.
Gossip columnists have a reciprocal relationship with the celebrities whose private lives are splashed about in the gossip column's pages. Of course, some gossip columnists can engage in borderline defamatory conduct, spreading innuendo about alleged immoral or illegal conduct that can injure celebrities' reputations. Yet at the same time, gossip columnists are also an important part of the "Star System" publicity machine that turns movie actors and musicians into celebrities and superstars that are the objects of the public's obsessive attention and interest. The publicity agents of celebrities often provide or "leak" information or rumors to gossip columnists to publicize the celebrity or their projects, or to counteract "bad press" that has recently surfaced about their conduct.

Philip V (Greek: Φίλιππος Ε΄) (238–179 BC) was King of Macedon from 221 to 179 BC. Philip's reign was principally marked by an unsuccessful struggle with the emerging power of Rome. Philip was attractive and charismatic as a young man. A dashing and courageous warrior, he was inevitably compared to Alexander the Great and was nicknamed the darling of all Greece (Greek: ἐρώμενος ἐγένετο τῶν Ἑλλήνων).Polybius, 7.12, on PerseusPolybius, 7.11.8 (Greek text)), on PerseusShipley, p. 56.

[[Jackson ratio]]

CATEGORIES: Tortoises, Turtle terms

Researched and devised by Dr. Oliphant Jackson, the Jackson ratio is a method of determining whether a member of the tortoise species Testudo graeca or Testudo hermanni is  maintaining its optimum bodyweight, which is necessary for a successful hibernation. The Jackson Ratio is calculated by taking the weight of the tortoise in grams and dividing it by the cube of the length of the tortoise's carapace in centimeters. This is essentially a value of the density of the tortoise in g/cm^3. The optimal value for this ratio is 0.21 with a range of 0.18 - 0.22 being acceptable for hibernation. Values significantly less than this indicate an underweight tortoise and larger values are indicative of overweight tortoises. The Jackson Ratio is expressed as a graph of minimum and optimum weights for a given carapace length. This exhibits the same principle without the maths.

One of the driving forces behind the creation of the Bulletin was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy at the dawn of the atomic age.

[[Oval window]]

CATEGORIES: Auditory system, Ear

The oval window (or vestibular window) is a membrane-covered opening which leads from the middle ear to the vestibule of the inner ear.
Vibrations that come into contact with the tympanic membrane travel through the three ossicles and into the inner ear. The oval window is the intersection of the middle ear with the inner ear, and is directly contacted by the stapes; by the time vibrations reach the oval window, they have been amplified over twenty times from what they were when they contacted the tympanic membrane, a testament to the amplifying power of the middle ear.
It is a reniform (kidney-shaped) opening leading from the tympanic cavity into the vestibule of the internal ear; its long diameter is horizontal, and its convex border is upward. In the recent state it is occupied by the base of the stapes, the circumference of which is fixed by the annular ligament to the margin of the foramen.

[[Edwardian era]]

The Edwardian era or Edwardian period in the United Kingdom is the period covering the reign of King Edward VII, 1901 to 1910, and is sometimes extended beyond Edward's death to include years leading up to World War I.
The death of Queen Victoria in January 1901 and the succession of her son Edward marked the end of the Victorian era. While Victoria had shunned society, Edward was the leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of Continental Europe—perhaps because of the King's fondness for travel. The era was marked by significant shifts in politics as sections of society that had been largely excluded from wielding power in the past, such as common labourers and women, became increasingly politicised.Hattersley, Roy (2004). The Edwardians. London: Little, Brown. ISBN 0-316-72537-4.
The Edwardian period is frequently extended beyond Edward's death in 1910 to include the years up to the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, the start of World War I in 1914, the end of hostilities with Germany in 1918, or the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.

Damon Albarn ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|m|ən|_|ˈ|æ|l|b|ɑr|n[/tpl]; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. He is best known for being the frontman of the Britpop/alternative rock band Blur as well as vocalist and principal songwriter of virtual band Gorillaz.
Raised in Leytonstone, East London and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended Stanway Comprehensive School, where he met Graham Coxon and eventually formed Blur whose debut album, Leisure, was released in 1991 to mixed reviews. After spending long periods of time touring the United States, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result of these influences came in the form of Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three albums received widespread critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a rivalry shared with Oasis. Subsequent albums contained influences from lo-fi, electronic and hip hop music.
In 1998, Albarn along with Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, formed the "virtual band" Gorillaz. Drawing influences from hip hop, electronica, dub and alternative rock, the band released their self-titled debut album in 2001 which was hugely successful worldwide. Although Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, the albums feature many collaborations from a wide range of artists. Gorillaz are cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the "Most Successful Virtual Band".
Other projects include working with African musicians in aid of the charity Oxfam, writing and performing lead vocals on The Good, the Bad & the Queen as part of an unnamed supergroup featuring Tony Allen, Paul Simonon and Simon Tong and composing film soundtracks. He has also ventured into the world of opera with Dr Dee and Monkey: Journey to the West. He is also a well-known Chelsea F.C. fan and frequently attends games involving the Blues at Stamford Bridge.
Albarn's debut solo album Everyday Robots was released in his native United Kingdom on 28 April 2014, co-produced by XL Recordings CEO Richard Russell and featured collaborations with Brian Eno and Natasha Khan.
Albarn was voted the fourth-greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 UK Poll for Q Music magazine.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7519708/Liam-Gallagher-crowned-best-frontman.html |title=Liam Gallagher crowned best frontman |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-03-26 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]

[[Signalling System No. 7]]

CATEGORIES: ITU-T recommendations, Signaling System 7, Telephony

Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) is a set of telephony signaling protocols which are being used to set up most of the world's public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone calls. The main purpose is to set up and tear down telephone calls.  Other uses include number translation, local number portability, prepaid billing mechanisms, short message service (SMS), and a variety of other mass market services.
It is usually referenced as Signalling System No. 7 or Signalling System #7, or simply abbreviated to SS7. In North America it is often referred to as CCSS7, an abbreviation for Common Channel Signalling System 7. In some European countries, specifically the United Kingdom, it is sometimes called C7 (CCITT number 7) and is also known as number 7 and CCIS7 (Common Channel Interoffice Signaling 7). In Germany it is often called N7 (Signalisierungssystem Nummer 7).
There is only one international SS7 protocol defined by ITU-T in its Q.700-series recommendations.ITU-T Recommendation Q.700  There are however, many national variants of the SS7 protocols.  Most national variants are based on two widely deployed national variants as standardized by ANSI and ETSI, which are in turn based on the international protocol defined by ITU-T.  Each national variant has its own unique characteristics.  Some national variants with rather striking characteristics are the Chinese and Japanese (TTC) national variants.
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has also defined level 2, 3, and 4 protocols that are compatible with SS7:
but use a Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) transport mechanism. This suite of protocols is called SIGTRAN.

Matsya ([tpl]lang-sa|मत्स्य[/tpl], literally "Fish") is the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu in the form of a fish, preceding Kurma. Often listed as the first avatar in the lists of the ten primary avatars of Vishnu, Matsya is described to have rescued the first man, Manu, from a great deluge. Matsya may be depicted as a giant fish, or anthropomorphically with a human torso connected to the rear half of a fish.
The earliest accounts of the legend associate Matsya with the creator god Prajapati (identified with Brahma). However, Puranic scriptures incorporate Matsya as an avatar of Vishnu. Matsya forewarns Manu about an impending catastrophic flood and orders him to collect all the grains of the world in a boat; in some forms of the story, all living creatures are also to be preserved in the boat. When the flood destroys the world, Manu - in some versions accompanied by the seven great sages - survives by boarding the ark, which Matsya pulls to safety. In later versions of this story, the sacred texts Vedas are hidden by a demon, whom Matsya slays: Manu is rescued and the scriptures are recovered. The tale is in the tradition of the family of flood myths, common across cultures.

He studied under the famed drummer, Louis Cottrell, Sr.
Paul Barbarin's year of birth is often given as 1901, but his brother Louis Barbarin (born 1902) said he was quite sure that Paul was several years older than he was, and Paul Barbarin simply refused to answer the year of his birth in an interview at Tulane's Jazz Archives.
From the late 1910s on, Barbarin divided his time between Chicago, New York City and New Orleans, and touring with such bands as those of Joe "King" Oliver, Luis Russell, Louis Armstrong, and Henry Red Allen.  From the 1950s on he usually led his own band. He, along with Louis Cottrell, Jr. founded and led the second incarnation of the Onward Brass Band from 1960 to 1969.
Barbarin was an accomplished and knowledgeable musician, a member of ASCAP, and the composer of a number of pop tunes and Dixieland standards, including "Come Back Sweet Papa", "Don't Forget to Mess Around (When You're Doing the Charleston)", "Bourbon Street Parade", and "(Paul Barbarin's) Second Line".

[[Varaha]]

Varaha ([tpl]lang-sa|वराह[/tpl], "boar") is the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu in the form of a boar, succeeding Kurma and preceding Narasimha. Varaha is listed as third in the Dashavatara, the ten principal avatars of Vishnu.  When the demon Hiranyaksha stole the earth (personified as the goddess Bhudevi) and hid her in the primordial waters, Vishnu appeared as Varaha to rescue her. Varaha slew the demon and retrieved the Earth from the ocean, lifting it on his tusks, and restored Bhudevi to her place in the universe.
Varaha may be depicted completely as a boar or in an anthropomorphic form, with a boar's head and human body. His consort, Bhudevi, the earth, is often depicted as a young woman, lifted by Varaha. The earth may be depicted as a mass of land too.

[[Hiranyaksha]]

CATEGORIES: Asura, Rakshasa

In Hinduism, Hiranyaksha ([tpl]lang-sa|हिरण्‍याक्ष[/tpl]) golden-eyed was an Asura of pre-ancient India and the son of Diti and Kashyap. 
He was slain by the god Vishnu after he (Hiranyaksha) took the Earth to the bottom of what has been described as the "Cosmic ocean".  
Vishnu assumed the Avatar of a boar - Varaha and dove into the ocean to lift the Earth, in the process slaying Hiranyaksha who was obstructing Him. The battle lasted one thousand years.  
He had an elder brother named Hiranyakashipu, who after having undertaken penances which made him  incredibly powerful and invincible unless several conditions were met, was later slain by Narasimha, another avatar of Vishnu.
Kashyapa (Sanskrit कश्यप kaśyapa) was an ancient sage (rishis), who is one of the Saptarshis in the present Manvantara; with others being Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadwaja 1
He was the father of the Devas, Asuras, Nagas and all of humanity. He married Aditi, with whom he fathered Agni, the Aditya.2 With his second wife, Diti, he begot the Daityas. Diti and Aditi were daughters of King Daksha Prajapati and sisters to Sati, Shiva's consort. 
Diti conceived a child in the evening time, whom she carried for a hundred years in the womb. She thus gave birth to Hiranyaksha.

Florence Nightingale, OM, RRC ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|f|l|ɒr|ə|n|s|_|ˈ|n|aɪ|t|ɨ|ŋ|ɡ|eɪ|l[/tpl]; 12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910) was a celebrated English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing. She came to prominence while serving as a nurse during the Crimean War, where she tended to wounded soldiers. She was known as "The Lady with the Lamp" after her habit of making rounds at night.
Early 21st century commentators have asserted Nightingale's achievements in the Crimean War had been exaggerated by the media at the time, to satisfy the public's need for a hero, but her later achievements remain widely accepted. In 1860, Nightingale laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital in London. It was the first secular nursing school in the world, now part of King's College London. The Nightingale Pledge taken by new nurses was named in her honour, and the annual International Nurses Day is celebrated around the world on her birthday. Her social reforms include improving healthcare for all sections of British society, improving healthcare and advocating for better hunger relief in India, helping to abolish laws regulating prostitution that were overly harsh to women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the workforce.
Nightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime much of her published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her tracts were written in simple English so they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills. She also helped popularise the graphical presentation of statistical data. Much of her writing, including her extensive work on religion and mysticism, has only been published posthumously.

Hiranyakashipu (or Hiranyakasipu) ([tpl]lang-sa|हिरण्‍यकशिपु[/tpl]) in gold"; the name is said to depict one who is very much fond of wealth and sex life; (hiranya=gold, kashipu=soft cushion) is an Asura from the Puranic scriptures of Hinduism. His younger brother, Hiranyaksha was slain by Varaha, one of the Avatars of Vishnu. Angered by this, Hiranyakashipu decided to gain magical powers by performing a penance for Lord Brahma. He was subsequently killed by the Narasimha Avatara of Lord Vishnu. His tale depicts the futility of desiring power over others and the strength of God's protection over his fully surrendered devotees (in the case of his son Prahlada). 
The story of Hiranyakashipu happens in three parts. The first has to do with the curse of the Four Kumaras on the gatekeepers of Vaikuntha, Jaya and Vijaya, which causes them to be born as the asuras Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu. The second part deals with Hiranyakashipu's penance to propitiate Brahma and gain a boon from him. The final part deals with his efforts to kill his son Prahlada (a devotee of Vishnu) and his subsequent death at the hands of Narasimha.

Out of the Unknown is a British television science fiction anthology drama series, produced by the BBC and broadcast on BBC2 in four series between 1965 and 1971. Each episode was a dramatisation of a science fiction short story. Some were written directly for the series, but most were adaptations of already published stories.
The first three years were exclusively science fiction, but that genre was abandoned in the final year in favour of horror/fantasy stories. A number of episodes were wiped during the early 1970s, as was standard procedure at the time. A large number of episodes are still missing but some do turn up from time to time; for instance, Level Seven from series two, originally broadcast on 27 October 1966 was returned to the BBC from the archives of a European broadcaster in January 2006.

[[Klismaphilia]]

CATEGORIES: Anal eroticism, Paraphilias, Sexual acts

Klismaphilia (sometimes spelled Klysmaphilia) is receiving sexual arousal from introducing liquids into the rectum and colon via the anus. It is a paraphilia that often involves the use of enemas.Paraphilias from Psychology Today[tpl]cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1973|title=Klismaphilia: enema as a sexual preference. Report of two cases.|journal=Am J Psychother.|volume=27|pages=232–50 | issue=2|pmid=4704017[/tpl] The term klismaphilia was coined in 1973 by Dr. Joanne Denko, an early investigator in this field, to describe the activities of some of her patients.[tpl]cite journal|last=Agnew|first=J.|date=October 1982|title=Klismaphilia--a physiological perspective.|journal=American journal of psychotherapy|publisher=Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy|location=United States|volume=36|pages=554–66|issn=0002-9564|pmid=7158678|issue=4[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1976|title=Amplification of the erotic enema deviance.|journal=Am J Psychother.|volume=30|pages=236–55 | issue=2|pmid=937588[/tpl]
Klismaphiliacs can gain satisfaction through enema fantasies, by actually receiving one, or through the process of eliminating steps to receiving one. Klismaphilia is practiced by men and women, although, as with most paraphilias, men are more likely to be klismaphiliacs. They may also gain pleasure from a large, water distended belly or the feeling of internal pressure. Often, klismaphiliacs report discovering these desires after a chance administration of an enema sometime in their childhood, but some do report discovering these feelings later on. Klismaphilia is practiced both heterosexually and homosexually. The paraphilia may be used as a substitute or as an auxiliary by its practitioners for genital sexual activity. Usually, klismaphiliacs carry out normal lives and successfully engage in this behavior secretly. Klismaphiliacs may also try to get others to administer enemas under the pretense of being constipated. If this is the case they will probably try to conceal the pleasure they receive from these administrations.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) classifies klismaphilia under the diagnosis of "Paraphilias, Not Otherwise Specified." The diagnostic code is 302.9.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000. There is usually no question of treating klismaphilics since there is almost never any desire to be "cured". Health treatment for klismaphilia thus is typically only focused on ensuring the techniques employed and chemicals used are not harmful to the practitioner. Caution should always be maintained on the part of the practitioners experimenting with new techniques and concoctions; in certain cases cramps produced by the chemicals used have led to hospitalizations, in other circumstances the effects can even be life-threatening.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y441825m5135088x/fulltext.pdf |title=Rectal Impaction With Epoxy Resin: A Case Report |publisher=Springerlink.com |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl]

[[Secret service]]
CATEGORIES: National security, Types of government agencies

A secret service describes a government agency, intelligence agency, or the activities of a government agency, concerned with the gathering of intelligence data. The tasks and powers of a secret service can vary greatly from one country to another. For instance, a country may establish a secret service which has some policing powers (such as surveillance) but not others. The powers and duties of a government organization may be partly secret and partly not. The organization may be said to operate openly at home and secretly abroad, or vice versa. Secret police and intelligence agencies can usually be considered secret services.
The French police officer Joseph Fouché is sometimes regarded as the primary pioneer within secret intelligence. Among other things, he is alleged to have prevented several murder attempts on Napoleon during his time as First Consul Bonaparte (1799-1804) through a large and tight net of various informers.

Ravi Shankar,  ([tpl]IPA-bn|ˈrɔbi ˈʃɔŋkɔr|IPA[/tpl]; 7 April 1920[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]11 December 2012), his name often preceded by the title Pandit, was an Indian musician who was one of the best-known exponents of the sitar in the second half of the 20th century as well as a composer of Hindustani classical music. 
Shankar was born in Varanasi and spent his youth touring Europe and India with the dance group of his brother Uday Shankar. He gave up dancing in 1938 to study sitar playing under court musician Allauddin Khan. After finishing his studies in 1944, Shankar worked as a composer, creating the music for the Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray, and was music director of All India Radio, New Delhi, from 1949 to 1956.
In 1956, he began to tour Europe and the Americas playing Indian classical music and increased its popularity there in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Beatles guitarist George Harrison. Shankar engaged Western music by writing concerti for sitar and orchestra, and toured the world in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992 he served as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Parliament of India. In 1999, Shankar was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna. He continued to perform up until the end of his life.

Jamadagni (or Jamdagni, [tpl]lang-sa|जमदग्नि[/tpl]) is one of the Saptarishis (Seven Great Sages Rishi) in the seventh, current Manvantara, and father of Parashurama, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu.Avalon, Arthur (Sir John Woodroffe) (1913, reprint 1972) (tr.) Tantra of the Great Liberation (Mahāanirvāna Tantra), New York: Dover Publications, ISBN 0-486-20150-3, p. xli:  The Rishi are seers who know, and by their knowledge are the makers of shastra and "see" all mantras. The word comes from the root rish Rishati-prāpnoti sarvvang mantrang jnānena pashyati sangsārapārangvā, etc. The seven great Rishi or saptarshi of the first manvantara are Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya, and Vashishtha. In other manvantara there are other sapta-rshi. In the present manvantara the seven are Kashyapa, Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamdagnini, Bharadvaja. To the Rishi the Vedas were revealed. Vyasa taught the Rigveda so revealed to Paila, the Yajurveda to Vaishampayana, the Samaveda to Jaimini, Atharvaveda to Samantu, and Itihasa and Purana to Suta. The three chief classes of Rishi are the Brahmarshi, born of the mind of Brahma, the Devarshi of lower rank, and Rajarshi or Kings who became Rishis through their knowledge and austerities, such as Janaka, Ritaparna, etc. Thc Shrutarshi are makers of Shastras, as Sushruta. The Kandarshi are of the Karmakanda, such as Jaimini. He was a descendant of the sage Bhrigu, one of the Prajapatis created by Brahma, the God of Creation.

[[Kartavirya Arjuna]]

CATEGORIES: People in Hindu mythology

Kartavirya Arjuna ([tpl]lang-sa|कार्तवीर्य अर्जुन[/tpl], [tpl]IAST|Kārtavīrya Arjuna[/tpl]), was a legendary king of an ancient Haihayas kingdom  with capital at Mahishamati which is on the banks of Narmada River in the current state of Madhya Pradesh. Kartavirya was son of Kritavirya, king of the Haihayas. This is his patronymic, by which he is best known; his real name was Kartaviryarjuna. He is described as having a thousand hands and a great devotee of god Dattatreya. 
Vayu Purana extolls his virtues  Having worshipped a portion of the divine being called Dattatreya, sprung from the race of Atri, he sought and obtained these boons: a thousand arms and a golden chariot that went wheresoever he willed it to go; the power of restraining wrong by justice; the conquest of the earth and the disposition to rule it righteously; invincibility by enemies, and death at the hands of a man who was more powerful than himself. By him this earth was perfectly governed," and of him it is said:-"No other king shall ever equal Kartavirya in regard to sacrifices, liberality, austerities, courtesy, and self-restraint." "Thus he ruled for 85,000 years with unbroken health, prosperity, strength, and valour. 
The Mahabharata mentions him as one of the best warriors and introduces his divine origin, attributing it to the Padmini Ekadasi :
 The king (Kartavirya Arjuna's father) was very happy to hear this. Naturally he asked for the son he had desired for so long: 'O master of the universe, O killer of the Madhu demon, kindly grant me a son who will never be conquered by demigods, human beings, snakes, demons, or hobgoblins, but whom only You can defeat.' The Supreme Lord immediately replied, 'So be it!' and disappeared.
 The king became very pleased with his wife and returned to his palace in her company. Padmini soon became pregnant, and the many armed Kartaviryarjuna appeared as her son. He was the mightiest person in all the three worlds, and thus even tenheaded Ravana could not defeat him in battle. Except for Lord Narayana, who holds a club, a disc, and other symbols in his hands, no one could overcome him. By the merit that resulted from his mother's strict and faithful observance of Padmini Ekadasi, he could defeat even the dreaded Ravana. This is not at all surprising, O Naradaji, for Kartaviryarjuna was the fulfillment of the benediction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." With these words, Pulastya Muni departed.
The Supreme Lord, Sri Krisna, concluded, 'O sinless Yudhisthira, as you have inquired from me, I have explained to you the power of this special Ekadasi. O best of kings, whoever observes this fast will surely attain to My personal abode. And similarly, if you want all your desires fulfilled, you should do likewise.
The prayer for return of lost or misplaced things is addressed to Karthviryarjuna.{reference needed}

Bobby Darin (born Walden Robert Cassotto; May 14, 1936 – December 20, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, and actor of film and television.  He performed in a range of music genres, including pop, rock'n'roll, jazz, folk, and country.
He started as a songwriter for Connie Francis, and recorded his own first million-seller "Splish Splash" in 1958. This was followed by "Dream Lover", "Mack the Knife", and "Beyond the Sea", which brought him world fame. In 1962, he won a Golden Globe for his first film Come September, co-starring his first wife, Sandra Dee.
Throughout the 1960s, he became more politically active and worked on Robert Kennedy's Democratic presidential campaign. He was present on the night of June 4/5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the time of Kennedy's assassination. The same year, he discovered that he had been brought up by his grandparents, not his parents, and that the girl he thought was his sister was actually his mother. These events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion.
Although he made a successful television comeback, his health was beginning to fail, as he had always expected, following bouts of rheumatic fever in childhood.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114698,00.html|date=March 18, 1991|accessdate=16 August 2012|volume=35|number=10|first=Sandra |last=Dee|title=Learning to Live Again: A Former Teen Queen Shakes Free of Her Humiliating Past to End Years of Self-Hate and Loneliness|journal=People Magazine[/tpl] This knowledge of his vulnerability had always spurred him on to exploit his musical talent while still young.

She is also regarded as the daughter of King Himavan. Parvati, when depicted alongside Shiva, generally appears with two arms, but when alone, she is depicted having four, eight or ten arms, and is astride on a tiger or lion. Generally considered a benevolent Goddess, Parvati also has wrathful incarnations, such as Durga, Kali, Tara, Chandi, and the Dasha Mahavidyas (ten great wisdoms) Kali, Tara, Tripur Sundari (Shodashi), Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagla Mukhi, Matangi and Kamala, as well as benevolent forms like Katyayani, Maha Gauri, Kamalatmika, Bhuvaneshwari and Lalita.

[[Environmentally Sensitive Area]]

CATEGORIES: Protected areas of the United Kingdom, United Kingdom-related lists

An Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) is a type of designation for an agricultural area which needs special protection because of its landscape, wildlife or historical value. The scheme was introduced in 1987.  Originally it was administered by Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, then the Rural Development Service for the United Kingdom Governments Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and currently Natural England following successive re-organisation of the departments. In 2005 the scheme was superseded by Environmental Stewardship and closed to new entrants. Existing agreements remain active until they expire, meaning the designation will remain active until 2014. 
Farmers entered into a 10-year contract with the government and received an annual payment for the area that is part of the scheme. Farmers were expected to adopt environmentally friendly agricultural practices.

Medieval armies and weapons in western Europe: an illustrated history. McFarland & Company, Inc., 2005. Pp. 193.
The military decoration called the Iron Cross which existed in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire and Third Reich, was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia and first awarded on the  10th of March in 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars. The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War, World War I, and World War II. The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who were awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class and 2nd Class respectively for their actions as pilots during World War II.
The Iron Cross was used as the symbol of the German Army from 1871 to March/April 1918, when it was replaced by the bar cross. The Iron Cross was reintroduced as an award in the German Army in 1939 with a Swastika added in the center during the Third Reich in World War II. In 1956, the Iron Cross resumed its German military usage, as it became the symbol of the Bundeswehr, the modern German armed forces. The traditional design is black and this design is used on armored vehicles and aircraft. A newer design in blue and silver is used as the emblem in other contexts.

[[Gauri (raga)]]
CATEGORIES: Sikh kirtan, Hindustani ragas

Gauri is an India musical raga that appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Sikh holy scripture called Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS.) Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used; which notes can be used; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune. 
In the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy Granth (book) there are a total of 31 raga compositions and this raga is the third raga to appear in the series. The composition in this raga appear on a total of 196 pages from page numbers 151 to 347.
Gauri is one of several ragas that appears in the Ragmala as a ragini (subset) of Sri Raga. This is an evening raga assigned to autumn and its mood is contemplative.  The composition in Gauri is very voluminous. Gauri was used by Guru Nanak, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur.  Several forms of Gauri Raga exist historically and this probably accounts for the large number of variants: Gauri Cheti, Gauri Bairagan, Gauri Dipaki, Gauri Purbi-Dipaki, Gauri Guareri, Gauri-Majh, Gauri Malava, Gauri Mala, Gauri Sorath, Gauri Dakhani.
Occasionally Re is performed with a vibrate as in Siri Raga which has the same vadis.  Ni is given prominence through either stopping or lingering on this note.

She is Adi- Parashakti herself. The Devi Gita also known as Parvati Gita declares her to be the greatest Goddess. Thus, She is considered the supreme Goddess and primary deity in Shaktism, occupying a place similar to Lord Krishna in Vaishnavism. According to Skanda Purana, Goddess Parvati accounted the name 'Durga' after she killed the demon Durgamaasura. Goddess Parvati is considered to be the complete incarnation of Adi Parashakti or Goddess Durga, with all other Goddesses being her incarnations or manifestations. Whatever deity one is worshiping, ultimately, they are worshiping her. Adi Parashakti or Mahadevi, the Supreme power, is called Durga Shakti as per Devi-Mahatmya. Adi parashakti or Devi Durga is a Hindu concept of the Ultimate Shakti or Mahashakti, the ultimate power inherent in all Creation. According to Markandeya Purana, Durga, Parvati or Chandika, the original form of Adi Parashakti is Goddess Lakshmi and Goddess Saraswati in her mild form; Goddess Kali and Goddess Chandi in her wrathful form. Adi parashakti or Devi Durga is a Hindu concept of the Ultimate Shakti or Mahashakti, the ultimate power inherent in all Creation. This is especially prevalent in the Shakta denomination within Hinduism, which worships the Goddess Devi in all Her manifestations.

[[Subtropical cyclone]]
CATEGORIES: Tropical cyclone meteorology, Midlatitude weather, Subtropical cyclones, Types of cyclone

A subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical and an extratropical cyclone.  As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical or extratropical cyclones.  They were officially recognized by the National Hurricane Center in 1972.  Subtropical cyclones began to receive names from the official tropical cyclone lists in the North Atlantic hurricane basin and the southwest Indian ocean.
There are two definitions currently used for subtropical cyclones.  Across the north Atlantic and southwest Indian ocean, they require central convection fairly near the center and a warming core in the mid-levels of the troposphere.  Across the eastern half of the northern Pacific, they require a mid-tropospheric cyclone to cut off from the main belt of the westerlies and only a weak surface circulation.  Subtropical cyclones have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and have no weather fronts linked into their center.
Since they form from initially extratropical cyclones which have colder temperatures aloft than normally found in the tropics, the sea surface temperatures required for their formation are lower than the tropical cyclone threshold by 3°C (5°F), lying around 23 °C (73 °F).  This also means that subtropical cyclones are more likely to form outside the traditional bounds of the hurricane season.

The French Quarter, also known as the Vieux Carré, is the oldest neighborhood in the city of New Orleans. After New Orleans (La Nouvelle-Orléans in French) was founded in 1718 by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, the city developed around the Vieux Carré ("Old Square" in English), a central square. The district is more commonly called the French Quarter today, or simply "The Quarter," related to changes in the city with American immigration after the Louisiana Purchase.New Orleans French Quarter History, Architecture and Pictures Most of the present-day historic buildings were constructed during the late 18th century, during the city's period of Spanish rule, and reflect Spanish colonial architecture.
The district as a whole has been designated as a National Historic Landmark, with numerous contributing buildings that are separately deemed significant. It is a prime tourist destination in the city, as well as attracting loyal residents. Because of its distance from areas where the levee was breached during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, it suffered relatively light damage as compared to other areas of the city and the greater region.

[[Savitr]]

Savitr (Sanskrit:  stem [tpl]IAST|savitr-[/tpl],  nominative singular [tpl]IAST|savitā[/tpl]) is a solar deity in the Rigveda, and one of the Adityas i.e. off-spring of Vedic deity Aditi. 
His name in Vedic Sanskrit connotes "impeller, rouser, vivifier". 
He is sometimes identified with—and at other times distinguished from--Surya, "the Sun". When considered distinct from the Sun proper, he is conceived of as the divine influence or vivifying power of the Sun. The Sun before sunrise is called Savitr, and after sunrise until sunset it is called Surya.Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary (1899).
Savitr is celebrated in eleven whole hymns of the Rig Veda and in parts of many others, his name being mentioned about 170 times in aggregate.
Savitr disappeared as an independent deity from the Hindu pantheon after the end of the Vedic period, but in modern Hinduism, his name occurs in the well-known Gayatri mantra (taken from book three of the Rigveda), which is also known as Savitri because of this.

[[Bhaga]]

Sanskrit [tpl]IAST|bhaga[/tpl] is a term for "lord, patron", but also for "wealth, prosperity". The cognate term in Avestan and Old Persian is [tpl]lang|peo-Latn|baga[/tpl], of uncertain meaning but used in a sense in which "lord, patron" might also apply. A Slavic cognate is [tpl]lang|sla-Latn|bog[/tpl] "god". While the word "bog" denoted nearly all Slavic gods, the word Deva in its cognate Div was used only for the creator god - Rod, the Slavic equivalent of Brahma.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] The semantics is similar to English lord (from hlaford "bread warden"), the idea being that it is part of the function of a chieftain or leader to distribute riches or spoils among his followers. The name Baghdad shares its origins with the Middle Persian baga (baga-data: "god given", modern Persian: "Baghdad")
Personified, [tpl]IAST|Bhaga[/tpl] is  one of the Adityas, a god of wealth and marriage in Hinduism. Virabhadra, a great powerful hero created by Shiva, once blinded him. In the Rigveda Bhaga is the god who supervises the distribution of goods and destiny to each man corresponding to his merits. The word apparently, is cognative to "Bhagavan" and "Bhagya", terms used in several Indian languages to refer to God & destiny respectively.
In some references Bhag, Bhaga or Bhagya is miss-termed as Lord Sun. In fact Bhagya is the son of Lord Sun. Father Sun awarded him with the powers to give away or take away anything from the human race. He is the real and practical benefactor among all the 33 Crore deities.

Along with him was created, his consort or wife Bhadrakali, from the wrath of Devi.the Horse-sacrifice of the Prajapati Daksha The Mahabharata translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli (1883–1896), Book 12: Santi Parva: Mokshadharma Parva: Section CCLXXXIV. p. 315 Mahadeva created from his mouth a terrible Being whose very sight could make one's hair stand on its end. The blazing flames that emanated from his body rendered him exceedingly awful to behold. His arms were many in number and in each was a weapon that struck the beholder with fear. p. 317. “I am known by the name of Virabhadra’’ and I have sprung from the wrath of Rudra. This lady (who is my companion), and who is called Bhadrakali, hath sprung from the wrath of the goddess.”Vishnu Purana SACRIFICE OF DAKSHA (From the Vayu Purana.) The Vishnu Purana, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, 1840. p. 62, "In former times, Daksha commenced a holy sacrifice on the side of Himaván, at the sacred spot Gangadwara, frequented by the Rishis. The gods, desirous of assisting at this solemn rite, came, with Indra at their head, to Mahadeva, and intimated their purpose; and having received his permission, departed in their splendid chariots to Gangadwára, as tradition reports.” 62:2 The Linga Purana is more precise, calling it Kanakhala, which is the village still called Kankhal, near Haridwar.p. 66 Rudrakali. p. 68 Vírabhadra said, 'I am not a god, nor an Aditya; nor am I come hither for enjoyment, nor curious to behold the chiefs of the divinities: know that I am come to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha, and that I am called Vírabhadra, the issue of the wrath of Rudra. Bhadrakali also, who has sprung from the anger of Devi, is sent here by the god of gods to destroy this rite. Take refuge, king of kings, with him who is the lord of Uma; for better is the anger of Rudra than the blessings of other gods.'
Vīrabhadra is described as a warrior who eventually blinded Bhaga and broke, among many other countless gods, Pushan's teeth. Other gods fled the battlefield unable to sustain his power. A temple dedicated to him, is situated in the town of Veerbhadra, near Rishikesh in Uttarakhand and in Pasumbalur, near Perambalur district, Tamil Nadu He belongs to Rajaka caste.

In the Tibetan language, "svaha" is translated as "so be it" and is often pronounced and orthographically represented as "soha". Whenever fire sacrifices are made, svāhā is chanted.

[[Devaki]]
CATEGORIES: People related to Krishna

In Hinduism, Devaki (देवकी) is the wife of Vasudeva and biological mother of Krishna.Devaki  
She was the daughter of Devaka, the younger brother of King Ugrasena of Mathura. She was a partial incarnation of Aditi, the mother of the Devas.
The birth of Krishna is in itself a transcendental phenomenon that generates awe among the Hindus and overwhelms one and all with its supra mundane happenings.
Mother Earth, unable to bear the burden of sins committed by evil kings and rulers, appealed to Brahma, the Creator for help. Brahma prayed to the Supreme Lord Vishnu, who assured him that he would soon be born on earth to annihilate tyrannical forces.
One such evil force was Kansa, the ruler of Mathura (in northern India) and his people were utterly terrified of him. On the day Kansa's sister Devaki was married off to Vasudeva, an akashvani or voice from the sky was heard prophesying that Devaki's 8th son would be the destroyer of Kansa.The frightened Kansa immediately unsheathed his sword to kill his sister but Vasudeva intervened and implored Kamsa to spare his bride, and promised to hand over every new born child to him. Kamsa relented but imprisoned both Devaki and her husband Vasudeva.
When Devaki gave birth to her first child, Kamsa came to the prison cell and slaughtered the newborn. In this way, he killed the first six sons of Devaki. Even before her 8th child was born, Devaki and Vasudeva started lamenting its fate and theirs. Then suddenly Lord Vishnu appeared before them and said he himself was coming to rescue them and the people of Mathura. He asked Vasudeva to carry him to the house of his friend, the cowherd chief Nanda in Gokula right after his birth, where Nanda's wife Yashoda had given birth to a daughter.
He was to exchange his boy and bring Yashoda's baby daughter back to the prison. Vishnu assured them that "nothing shall bar your path".
At midnight on ashtami, the divine baby was born in Kamsa's prison. Remembering the divine instructions, Vasudeva clasped the child to his bosom and started for Gokula, but found that his legs were in chains. He jerked his legs and was unfettered! The massive iron-barred doors unlocked and opened up.
While crossing river Yamuna, Vasudeva held his baby high over his head. The rain fell in torrents and the river was in spate. But the water made way for Vasudeva and miraculously a five-mouthed snake followed him from behind and provided shelter over the baby.
When Vasudeva reached Gokula, he found the door of Nanda's house open. He exchanged the babies and hurried back to the prison of Kamsa with the baby girl. Early in the morning, all the people at Gokula rejoiced the birth of Nanda's beautiful male child. Vasudeva came back to Mathura and as he entered, the doors of the prison closed themselves.
When Kansa came to know about the birth, he rushed inside the prison and tried to kill the baby. But this time it skipped from his hand and reaching the sky. She was transformed into the goddess Yogamaya, who told Kansa: "O foolish! What will you get by killing me? Your nemesis is already born somewhere else."
In his youth Krishna killed Kansa along with all his cruel associates, liberated his parents from prison, and reinstated Ugrasen as the King of Mathura.

[[Vasudeva]]

CATEGORIES: People related to Krishna, Characters in the Mahabharata

In Hindu itihasa or more commonly known as Hindu history, Vasudeva (Devanagari [tpl]lang|sa|वसुदेव[/tpl], IAST [tpl]IAST|Vasudeva[/tpl]) is the father of Krishna, the son of Shoorsen, of the Yadu and Vrishni dynasties. His sister Kunti was married to Pandu. Kunti plays a big role later in the war Mahabharata. 
Vasudeva was a partial incarnation of Rishi Kashyap. 
The patronymic [tpl]IAST|Vāsudeva[/tpl] (with long ā) is a popular name of Krishna. According to the Harivansa Purana, Vasudeva and Nanda were brothers.Lok Nath Soni, The cattle and the stick: an ethnographic profile of the Raut of Chhattisgarh. Anthropological Survey of India, Govt. of India, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Dept. of Culture (2000).
Related to this name is an early religion, sometimes called Bhagavatism that was largely formed by the 4th century BC where Vāsudeva (Krishna, the son of Vasudeva) was worshiped as the supreme Deity in a strongly monotheistic format, where the Supreme Being was perfect, eternal and full of grace.[tpl]Harvnb|Hastings|2003|pp=540–42[/tpl]
The name forms part of a famous mantra also known as a "twelve syllable mantra", which believed to be the earliest mantra from pre-reformation times, pre-dating sectarian divisions in Vaishnavism- (IAST [tpl]IAST|oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya[/tpl]), it is translated as "Om, reverence to the Lord Vāsudeva (Krishna)".[tpl]Harvnb|Hastings|2003|p=547[/tpl]
Vasudeva married Devaki, the sister of Kansa, and he was also the father of Krishna's sister Subhadra. From his first wife, Rohini, who bore his eldest son, Balarama. 
Vasudeva and Devaki spent most of their early adult life behind bars in the deepest pits of darkness as ordered by Kansa. Vasudeva was known for his consistent approach to life and his virtue of being a truthful person, never uttering a lie during his lifetime. After Kansa was killed by Krishna, Vasudeva was installed as the Crown-Prince of Mathura under the reign of Devaki's uncle, King Ugrasena.
The name is from vásu "good" and deva "deity". The Vasus are a group of eight Vedic deities.

Radha (Devanagari: राधा, IAST: Rādhā), also called Radhika, Radharani and Radhikarani, is almost always depicted alongside Krishna and features prominently within the theology of today's Vallabha and  Gaudiya Vaishnava sects, which regards Radha as the original Goddess or Shakti. Radha is also the principal god of worship in the Nimbarka Sampradaya, as Nimbarka, the founder of the tradition, declared that Radha and Krishna together constitute the absolute truth.H.Wilson, 'English Translation', Motilal Banarsidas Publishers, 1990 reprint. Radha's relationship with Krishna is given in further detail within texts such as the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Garga Samhita and Brihad Gautamiya Tantra. 
Radha is the most important gopi in Raas (Special kind of dance) with Lord Krishna.
Radha is often referred to as Rādhārānī or "Radhika" in speech, prefixed with the respectful term 'Srimati' by devout followers. Radha is regarded as an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi.

In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a 'nationally important' archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. The various pieces of legislation used for legally protecting heritage assets from damage and destruction are grouped under the term ‘designation’. The protection given to scheduled monuments is given under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/46  |title=Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 |accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl] which is a different law from that used for listed buildings (which fall within the town and country planning system). A heritage asset is a part of the historic environment that is valued because of its historic, archaeological, architectural or artistic interest.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/historic_environment/6258.aspx  |title=Protecting the Historic Environment |publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport |accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl] Only some of these are judged to be important enough to have extra legal protection through designation.
There are about 20,000 scheduled monuments in England representing about 37,000 heritage assets.[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/ScheduledMonuments.pdf |title= Scheduled Monuments |publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport |date=March 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl] Of the tens of thousands of scheduled monuments in the UK, most are inconspicuous archaeological sites, but some are large ruins. According to the 1979 Act, a monument cannot be a structure which is occupied as a dwelling, used as a place of worship or protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. As a rule of thumb, a protected historic asset that is occupied would be designated as a listed building.

[[Kalki]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu gods, Forms of Vishnu, Hindu eschatology, Hindu philosophical concepts, Messianism

In Hinduism, Kalki (Devanagari: [tpl]lang|dvg|कल्कि[/tpl]; meaning 'Eternity,' 'White Horse,' or 'Destroyer of Filth') is the final incarnation of Vishnu in the current Mahayuga, foretold to appear at the end of Kali Yuga, the current epoch. Religious texts called the Puranas foretell that Kalki will be atop a white horse with a drawn blazing sword. He is the harbinger of the end time in Hindu eschatology, after which he will usher in Satya Yuga.
The name Kalki is a metaphor for eternity or time. Its origins may lie in the Sanskrit word kalka which means foulness or filth. Hence, the name translates to the 'destroyer of foulness,' 'destroyer of darkness," or 'destroyer of ignorance.'[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ismaili.net/Source/nikakalki.html |title=The Kalki Purana |publisher=Ismaili.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20[/tpl] Another etymology from Sanskrit is 'white horse.'[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yoga-philosophy.com/eng/kalki/kalki.htm |title=Appearance of Kalki Avatar |accessdate=2008-06-15 |year=2003 |work=yoga-philosophy.com[/tpl]

Paul Samuel Whiteman (March 28, 1890 – December 29, 1967) was an American bandleader, composer, orchestral director and violinist
Leader of one of the most popular dance bands in the United States during the 1920s, Whiteman produced recordings that were immensely successful, and press notices often referred to him as the "King of Jazz". Using a large ensemble and exploring many styles of music, Whiteman is perhaps best known for his blending of symphonic music and jazz, as typified by his 1924 commissioning and debut of George Gershwin's jazz-influenced "Rhapsody In Blue". Later, Whiteman's work on Symphonic Jazz influenced many jazz musicians either way - directly or indirectly - as diverse as Miles Davis, Gil Evans, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Wynton Marsalis and other modern artists.http://www.redhotjazz.com/whiteman.html Whiteman recorded many jazz and pop standards during his career, including "Wang Wang Blues", "Mississippi Mud", "Rhapsody in Blue", "Wonderful One", "Hot Lips (He's Got Hot Lips When He Plays Jazz)", "Mississippi Suite", and "Grand Canyon Suite". His popularity faded in the swing music era of the 1930s, and by the 1940s Whiteman was semi-retired from music. 
Whiteman's place in the history of early jazz is somewhat controversial. Detractors suggest that Whiteman's ornately-orchestrated music was jazz in name only (lacking the genre's improvisational and emotional depth), and co-opted the innovations of black musicians. Defenders note that Whiteman's fondness for jazz was genuine (he worked with black musicians as much as was feasible during an era of racial segregation), that his bands included many of the era's most esteemed white jazz musicians, and argue that Whiteman's groups handled jazz admirably as part of a larger repertoire.Critic Scott Yannow declares that Whiteman's orchestra "did play very good jazz; ... His superior dance band used some of the most technically skilled musicians of the era in a versatile show that included everything from pop tunes and waltzes to semi-classical works and jazz. ... Many of his recordings (particularly those with Beiderbecke) have been reissued numerous times and are more rewarding than his detractors would lead one to believe."

[[Krewe]]

CATEGORIES: Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Louisiana, Carnivals

A krewe (pronounced in the same way as "crew") is an organization that puts on a parade and/or a ball for the Carnival season. The term is best known for its association with New Orleans Mardi Gras, but is also used in other Carnival celebrations around the Gulf of Mexico, such as the Gasparilla Pirate Festival in Tampa, Florida, and Springtime Tallahassee as well as in La Crosse, Wisconsin"What is La Crosse Mardi Gras?" and at the Saint Paul Winter Carnival.
The word is thought to have been coined in the early 19th century by an organization calling themselves Ye Mistick Krewe of Comus,[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/323477/krewe|title= Krewe|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl] as an archaic affectation; with time it became the most common term for a New Orleans Carnival organization. The Mistick Krewe of Comus itself was inspired by a Mobile mystic society, with annual parades in Mobile, Alabama, called the Cowbellion de Rakin Society that dated from 1830."Carnival/Mobile Mardi Gras Timeline" (list of events),The Museum of Mobile, 2002, webpage:MoM-timeline.
Krewe members are assessed fees in order to pay for the parade and/or ball. Fees can range from thousands of dollars a year per person for the most elaborate parades to as little as $20 a year for smaller marching clubs. Criteria for krewe membership varies similarly, ranging from exclusive organizations largely limited to relatives of previous members to other organizations open to anyone able to pay the membership fee. Krewes with low membership fees may also require members to work to help build and decorate the parade floats and make their own costumes; higher priced krewes hire professionals to do this work. Parading krewe members are usually responsible for buying their own throws, the trinkets thrown to parade spectators according to Mobile and New Orleans tradition.
Some krewes also have other events like private dances or parties for members throughout the year. Some also make a point of supporting charities and good causes.
Each year krewes are responsible for electing Rex, the king of the carnival.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.answers.com/topic/krewe|title= Krewe|publisher=American Heritage Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl] The Rex Organization was formed to create a daytime parade for the residents of the city.

A lightsaber is an energy weapon featured in the Star Wars universe. It consists of a polished metal hilt which projects a brightly lit energy blade generally about 4 feet (1.22 meters) long, though some lightsabers are of a different length. The lightsaber is the signature weapon of the Jedi order and their Sith counterparts, both of whom can use them for close combat, or to deflect blaster bolts. Its distinct appearance was created using rotoscoping for the original films, and digitally for the prequel trilogy. The lightsaber first appeared in the original Star Wars film (1977) and every Star Wars movie has featured at least one lightsaber duel. In 2008, a survey of approximately 2,000 film fans found it to be the most popular weapon in film history.[tpl]Cite news| author = Sophie Borland | title = Lightsabre wins the battle of movie weapons | publisher = Daily Telegraph | date = 2008-01-21 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1576154/Lightsabre-wins-the-battle-of-movie-weapons.html | accessdate=2008-01-26[/tpl]
The lightsaber's energy blade cuts or burns/melts through most substances without resistance. It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another lightsaber's blade, or by energy shields. Some exotic saber-proof materials have been introduced in the Expanded Universe. An active lightsaber gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the blade into contact with another lightsaber's blade produces a loud crackle.

Dou Xian ([tpl]zh|c=窦宪[/tpl]; Wade-Giles:Tou Hsien, d. AD 92) was a prominent Chinese general and statesman of the Eastern Han Dynasty. A native of modern-day Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, he was part of the powerful Dou clan which dominated court politics during his tenure. However, his father Dou Xun fell into disgrace and died in 70, leaving Dou Xian an orphan. His fortunes were greatly enhanced, though, when his two sisters entered the imperial harem in 77. In the following year, the older of these two sisters became Empress Zhangde, the wife of Emperor Zhang of Han, and lasted briefly as empress dowager and regent during the early reign of Emperor He of Han.Crespigny, 170.

It consisted of 16 battleships divided into two squadrons, along with various escorts. Roosevelt sought to demonstrate growing American military power and blue-water navy capability. Hoping to enforce treaties and protect overseas holdings, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to build American sea power. Beginning with just 90 small ships, over one-third of them wooden, the navy quickly grew to include new modern steel fighting vessels. The hulls of these ships were painted a stark white, giving the armada the nickname "Great White Fleet".John Mack Faragher al. Out of Many: a history of the American People.

[tpl]About|a concept in Hinduism||RTA (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]RTA[/tpl]
In the Vedic religion, Ṛta (Sanskrit [tpl]lang|sa|ऋतं[/tpl] [tpl]IAST|ṛtaṃ[/tpl] "that which is properly joined; order, rule; truth") is the principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.Holdrege (2004:215). Panikkar (2001:350–351) remarks: "Ṛta is the ultimate foundation of everything; it is "the supreme", although this is not to be understood in a static sense. … It is the expression of the primordial dynamism that is inherent in everything …" In the hymns of the Vedas, Ṛta is described as that which is ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the natural, moral and sacrificial orders. Conceptually, it is closely allied to the injunctions and ordinances thought to uphold it, collectively referred to as Dharma, and the action of the individual in relation to those ordinances, referred to as Karma – two terms which eventually eclipsed Ṛta in importance as signifying natural, religious and moral order in later Hinduism.Holdrege (2004:215–216); Mahony (1998:3). Sanskrit scholar Maurice Bloomfield referred to Ṛta as "one of the most important religious conceptions of the Rig Veda", going on to note that, "from the point of view of the history of religious ideas we may, in fact we must, begin the history of Hindu religion at least with the history of this conception".Bloomfield (1908:12–13).

Abarimon is the name of a legendary race of people native to a country of the same name.  The people of Abarimon had backwards feet, but in spite of this handicap were able to run at great speed. They lived side by side with wild animals and attempts to capture them failed because they were so savage.
They lived in a great valley of Mount Imaus (now called the Himalayan Mountains). There was a special quality of air which meant if it was breathed for a long period of time it would be impossible to breathe any other type of air and the inhabitants could never leave the valley alive.
The Abarimon people were first described by Pliny the Elder in his book, Natural History (VII 11).  A similar tale is recounted by Aulus Gellius in Attic Nights.

[[Ahalya]]
CATEGORIES: Hindu sages, Sages in the Ramayana

In Hindu mythology, Ahalya ([tpl]lang-sa|अहल्या[/tpl], IAST Ahalyā), also known as  Ahilya, is the wife of the sage Gautama Maharishi. Many Hindu scriptures say that she was seduced by Indra (the king of the gods), cursed by her husband for infidelity, and liberated from the curse by Rama (an avatar of the god Vishnu).
Created by the god Brahma as the most beautiful woman, Ahalya was married to the much older Gautama. In the earliest full narrative, when Indra comes disguised as her husband, Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances. Later sources often absolve her of all guilt, describing how she falls prey to Indra's trickery, or is raped. In all narratives, Ahalya and her lover (or rapist) Indra are cursed by Gautama. The curse varies from text to text, but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation and redemption. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible to the world and how she is purified by offering Rama hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama's foot.
Ahalya's seduction by Indra and its repercussions form the central narrative of her story in all scriptural sources for her life.[tpl]sfn|Söhnen-Thieme|1996|pp=40–1[/tpl] Although the Brahmanas (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures to hint at her relationship with Indra, the 5th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic Ramayana – whose hero is Rama – is the first to explicitly mention her extra-marital affair in detail. Medieval story-tellers often focus on Ahalya's deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of the saving grace of God. Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern-age poetry and short stories, as well as in dance and drama. While ancient narratives are Rama-centric, contemporary ones focus on Ahalya, telling the story from her perspective. Other traditions deal with her children.
In traditional Hinduism, Ahalya is extolled as the first of the panchakanya ("five virgins"), archetypes of female chastity whose names are believed to dispel sin when recited. While some praise her loyalty to her husband and her undaunted acceptance of the curse and gender norms, others condemn her adultery.

Kubera ([tpl]lang-sa|कुबेर[/tpl], Pali/later Sanskrit: Kuvera) also spelt Kuber, is the Lord of Wealth and the god-king of the semi-divine Yakshas in Hindu mythology. He is regarded as the regent of the North (Dik-pala), and a protector of the world (Lokapala).  His many epithets extol him as the overlord of numerous semi-divine species and the owner of the treasures of the world. Kubera is often depicted as a fat man, adorned with jewels and carrying a money-pot or money-bag, and a club.
Originally described as the chief of evil spirits in Vedic-era texts, Kubera acquired the status of a Deva (god) only in the Puranas and the Hindu epics.  The scriptures describe that Kubera once ruled Lanka, but was overthrown by his demon stepbrother Ravana, later settling in the city of Alaka in the Himalayas. Descriptions of the "glory" and "splendours" of Kubera's city are found in many scriptures.
Kubera has also been assimilated into the Buddhist and Jain pantheons. In Buddhism, he is known as Vaisravana, the patronymic used of the Hindu Kubera and is also equated with Pañcika, while in Jainism, he is known as Sarvanubhuti.

Along with her sisters Amba and Ambalika, she was taken by force by Bhishma from their Swayamvara. Bhishma challenged the assembled Kings and Princes and defeated them.  He presented them to Satyavati for marriage to Vichitravirya. Vichitravirya married only Ambika and Ambalika, and rejected Amba since she had already given her heart to another.
After Vichitravirya's death his mother Satyavati sent for her first born, Rishi Veda Vyasa.  According to his mother's wishes, he visited both the wives of Vichitravirya to grant them each a son under the Niyoga system.  When Vyasa visited Ambika, she saw his dreadful, forbidding appearance and burning eyes.  In her frightened state, she closed her eyes and dared not open them.  Hence her son, Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas, was born blind.
After Dhritarashtra's birth, when Satyavati requested Vyasa to visit Ambika for the second time, she dared not go and sent her maid instead.  The maid also bore a son, Vidura, who was raised as a brother of Dhritarashtra and Pandu. Much later, Ambika accompanied Satyavati and Ambalika to the forest and ended her life in austerities.

[[Millipede]]

CATEGORIES: Millipedes, Detritivores

Millipedes (class Diplopoda) are myriapodous arthropods that have two pairs of legs on most body segments. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together as one (the name "Diplopoda" comes from the Greek words διπλοῦς (diplous), "double" and ποδός (podos), "foot"). Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a ball, like a pillbug.
The name "millipede" is a compound word formed from the Latin roots [tpl]lang|la|mille[/tpl] ("thousand") and [tpl]lang|la|pes[/tpl] ("foot"). Despite their name, no known millipede has 1,000 legs, although the rare species Illacme plenipes has up to 750.[tpl]cite news |author= |title=Most leggy millipede rediscovered |date=June 8, 2006 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5052966.stm |quote=Illacme plenipes has up to 750 legs...[/tpl] Common species have between 36 and 400 legs.

Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating decaying leaves and other dead plant matter. However, they can also be minor garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings.
Millipedes can be easily distinguished from the somewhat similar and related centipedes (Class Chilopoda) which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have a single pair of legs for each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.

[[Legendre polynomials]]
CATEGORIES: Special hypergeometric functions, Orthogonal polynomials, Polynomials

In mathematics, Legendre  functions are solutions to Legendre's differential equation:
They are named after Adrien-Marie Legendre. This ordinary differential equation is frequently encountered in physics and other technical fields. In particular, it occurs when solving Laplace's equation (and related partial differential equations) in spherical coordinates.
The Legendre differential equation may be solved using the standard power series method. The equation has regular singular points at x = ±1 so, in general, a series solution about the origin will only converge for |x| < 1. When n is an integer, the solution Pn(x) that is regular at x = 1 is also regular at x = −1, and the series for this solution terminates (i.e. it is a polynomial).
These solutions for n = 0, 1, 2, ... (with the normalization Pn(1) = 1) form a polynomial sequence of orthogonal polynomials called the Legendre polynomials. Each Legendre polynomial Pn(x) is an nth-degree polynomial. It may be expressed using Rodrigues' formula:
That these polynomials satisfy the Legendre differential equation ([tpl]EquationNote|1[/tpl]) follows by differentiating (n+1) times both sides of the identity
and employing the general Leibniz rule for repeated differentiation.[tpl]harvnb|Courant|Hilbert|1953|loc=II, §8[/tpl]  The Pn can also be defined as the coefficients in a Taylor series expansion:[tpl]Citation |author=George B. Arfken, Hans J. Weber |title=Mathematical Methods for Physicists |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |year=2005 |page=743 |isbn=0-12-059876-0[/tpl]
In physics, this ordinary generating function is the basis for multipole expansions.

[[The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle]]

CATEGORIES: Bruce Springsteen albums, 1973 albums, Albums produced by Mike Appel, Columbia Records albums, English-language albums

The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle is the second album by Bruce Springsteen and the as-yet-unnamed E Street Band, and is described by Allmusic as "one of the greatest albums in the history of rock & roll." It was released in 1973. The album includes the song "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", the band's most-used set-closing song for the first 10 years of its career.
As with Springsteen's first album, it was well-received critically but had little commercial success at the time. However, once Springsteen achieved popularity with Born to Run, several selections from this album became popular FM radio airplay and concert favorites.
In 2003, the album was ranked number 132 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[tpl]cite book |chapter=132 | The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle - Bruce Springsteen |chapterurl=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/the-wild-the-innocent-and-the-e-street-shuffle-bruce-springsteen-19691231 |accessdate=[tpl]date|2006-04-14[/tpl] |last=Levy |first=Joe |coauthors=Steven Van Zandt |title=Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |origyear=2005 |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Turnaround |location=London |isbn=1-932958-61-4 |oclc=70672814 |ref=RS500[/tpl]  On November 7, 2009, Springsteen and the E Street Band played the album in its entirety for the first time ever in a concert at Madison Square Garden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2009/11/bruce_springsteen_to_perform_e.html|publisher=nj.com|title=Bruce Springsteen to perform entire albums at Madison Square Garden shows|accessdate=11 April 2012|date=3 November 2009[/tpl]

[[Angiras (sage)]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu sages, Prajapatis, Brahmin gotras

Angiras (अंगिरस्, pronounced [tpl]IPA-hns|əŋɡirəs|[/tpl]; nominative singular Angirā, अंगिरा [tpl]IPA|əŋɡirɑː[/tpl]) is a rishi (or sage) who, along with sage Atharvan, is credited to have formulated ("heard") most of the fourth Veda called Atharvaveda. He is also mentioned in the other three Vedas. Sometimes he is reckoned as one of the Seven Great Sages, or saptarishis of the first Manvantara, with others being, Marichi, Atri, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya, and Vashishtha Inhabitants of the Worlds Mahanirvana Tantra, translated by Arthur Avalon, (Sir John Woodroffe), 1913, Introduction and Preface. The Rishi are seers who know, and by their knowledge are the makers of shastra and "see" all mantras. The word comes from the root rish Rishati-prapnoti sarvvang mantrang jnanena pashyati sangsaraparangva, etc. The seven great Rishi or saptarshi of the first manvantara are Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya, and Vashishtha. In other manvantara there are other sapta-rshi. In the present manvantara the seven are Kashyapa, Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja. To the Rishi the Vedas were revealed. Vyasa taught the Rigveda so revealed to Paila, the Yajurveda to Vaishampayana, the Samaveda to Jaimini, Atharvaveda to Samantu, and Itihasa and Purana to Suta. The three chief classes of Rishi are the Brah-marshi, born of the mind of Brahma, the Devarshi of lower rank, and Rajarshi or Kings who became Rishis through their knowledge and austerities, such as Janaka, Ritaparna, etc. Thc Shrutarshi are makers of Shastras, as Sushruta. The Kandarshi are of the Karmakanda, such as Jaimini. Bharadwaja maharshis was his descendant.
His wife is Surūpa and his sons are Utathya, Samvartana and Brihaspati. He is one of the ten Manasaputras (wish-born-son) of Lord Brahma. Other accounts say that he married Smriti (memory), the daughter of Daksha.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
The name Angirasas is applied generically to several Puranic individuals and things; a class of Pitris, the ancestors of man according to Hindu Vedic writings, and probably descended from the sage Angiras. In the Rigveda, Agni is sometimes referred to as Angiras or as a descendant of Angiras (RV 1.1). Agneya (Daughter of agni) & Agnayi is considered the mother of Angiras. In the Rigveda, Indra drives out cows from where they had been imprisoned by either a demon (Vala) or multiple demons (the Panis) and gifts them to the Angirasas (RV 3.31, 10.108 and a reference in 8.14). Mandala 6 of the Rigveda is attributed to a family of Angirasas.

[[Annapurna]]
CATEGORIES: Mountains of Nepal, Eight-thousanders, Mountain ranges of Nepal

Annapurna (Sanskrit, Nepali, Nepal Bhasa: अन्नपुर्ण) is a section of the Himalayas in north-central Nepal that includes 8,091 m (26,545 ft) Annapurna I, thirteen additional peaks over 7,000 m (22,970 ft) and 16 more over 6,000 m (19,690 ft).[ref]
</ref>
This section is a 55 km-long (34 mi-long) massif bounded by the Kali Gandaki Gorge on the west, the Marshyangdi River on the north and east, and Pokhara Valley on the south.  Annapurna I is tenth among Earth's fourteen eight-thousanders.  8167 metre Dhaulagiri I rises 34 km to the west across the Kali Gandaki Gorge, considered Earth's deepest canyon.
Annapurna is a Sanskrit name which literally means "full of food" (feminine form), but is normally translated as Goddess of the Harvests. In Hinduism, Annapurna is "... the universal and timeless kitchen-goddess ... the mother who feeds. Without her there is starvation, a universal fear: This makes Annapurna a universal goddess ... Her most popular shrine is located in Kashi, on the banks of the river Ganga." Her association with the giving of food (wealth) led her in time to be transformed into Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth.Pattanaik (2009), pp. 25, 27.
The entire massif and surrounding area are protected within the 7,629 km2 Annapurna Conservation Area, the first and largest conservation area in Nepal. The Annapurna Conservation Area is home to several world-class treks, including the Annapurna Circuit.
The Annapurna peaks are among the world's most dangerous mountains to climb, although in more recent history, using figures from only 1990 and after, Kangchenjunga has a higher fatality rate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.8000ers.com/cms/download.html?func=startdown&id=184 |title=Complete ascent — fatalities statistics of all 14 main 8000ers |publisher=8000ers.com |date=June 19, 2008 |accessdate=2013-05-30[/tpl]  As of the end of 2009, there had been 157 summit ascents of Annapurna I, and 60 climbing fatalities on the mountain.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.8000ers.com/cms/annapurna-i-general-info-186.html|title=Annapurna I |publisher= 8000ers.com |accessdate=2011-06-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110707065943/http://www.8000ers.com/cms/annapurna-i-general-info-186.html| archivedate= 7 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This fatality-to-summit ratio (38%) is the highest of any of the eight-thousanders.

[[Balance sheet]]
CATEGORIES: Financial statements, Accounting terminology

In financial accounting, a balance sheet or statement of financial position is a summary of the financial balances of a sole proprietorship, a business partnership, a corporation or other business organization, such as an LLC or an LLP. Assets, liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date, such as the end of its financial year. A balance sheet is often described as a "snapshot of a company's financial condition".[tpl]cite book |last=Williams |first=Jan R. |coauthors= Susan F. Haka, Mark S. Bettner, Joseph V. Carcello |title=Financial & Managerial Accounting |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin |year=2008 |page=40 |isbn=978-0-07-299650-0[/tpl]  Of the three basic financial statements, the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business' calendar year.
A standard company balance sheet has three parts: assets, liabilities and ownership equity.  The main categories of assets are usually listed first, and typically in order of liquidity.[tpl]cite book | last = Daniels | first = Mortimer | title = Corporation Financial Statements | publisher = New York : Arno Press | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-405-13514-9 | pages = 13–14[/tpl] Assets are followed by the liabilities. The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation, net worth must equal assets minus liabilities.Williams, p.50
Another way to look at the balance sheet equation is that total assets equals liabilities plus owner's equity. Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner's money (owner's or shareholders' equity). Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections "balancing".
A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand.  However, many businesses are not paid immediately; they build up inventories of goods and they acquire buildings and equipment.  In other words: businesses have assets and so they cannot, even if they want to, immediately turn these into cash at the end of each period.  Often, these businesses owe money to suppliers and to tax authorities, and the proprietors do not withdraw all their original capital and profits at the end of each period.  In other words businesses also have liabilities.

[[Apam Napat]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu gods, Rigvedic deities, Sea and river gods

Apam Napat  is an eminent figure of the Indo-Iranian pantheon. In the Rig Veda, Apām Napāt is the supreme god of creation. He created all existential beings (Rig Veda 2.35.2)2 . In Zoroastrianism, Apąm Napāt is a divinity of water, see also Burz.
Apām Napāt in Sanskrit and Apąm Napāt in Avestan mean "son of waters" (see Ap (water)).
Sanskrit and Avestan napāt ("grandson") are cognate to Latin nepōs and English nephew, but the name Apām Napāt has also been compared to Etruscan Nethuns and Celtic Nechtan and Roman Neptune.
In Yasht 19 of the Avesta Apąm Napāt appears as the Creator of mankind. Here, there is an evident link between the glory of sovereignty (Khvarenah) and Apąm Napāt who protects Khvarenah as the royal glory of Iranian kings. Apām Napāt is sometimes, for example in Rigveda book 2 hymn 35 verse 3, described as a creator deity who originates in the cosmic waters (see: Agni). He is ascribed a golden splendour that can be associated with fire. The reference to fire may have originally referred to flames from natural gas or oil seepages surfacing through water, as in a fire temple at Surakhany near Baku in Azerbaijan (Jivanji Jamshedji Modi 1926).[tpl]Dubious|date=January 2009[/tpl] There is a conjecture that the word "naphtha" came (via Greek, where it meant any sort of petroleum) from the name "Apam Napat".Studies in ancient technology by R.

Born in Hong Kong in 1955, Lam initially went to an acting school. After finding he preferred making films to acting, he went to Canada to study film. In 1983, he returned and began filming comedy films. After the commercial success of his film Aces Go Places IV, he was allowed to develop his own film. Lam directed City on Fire in 1987 which led him to winning his first Hong Kong Film Award.
Lam followed up City on Fire with other similar films that shared a dark view of Hong Kong society. Many of these films starred Chow Yun Fat. In 1996, Lam made his first American film, Maximum Risk starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Lam would continue working on film productions in both Hong Kong and two more American productions with Jean Claude Van Damme until 2003. Lam's final directorial effort was directing one third of the portmanteau film Triangle along with Tsui Hark and Johnnie To. In 2014, it was announced that Lam was working on a new feature film.

[[Aranyani]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu goddesses, Nature goddesses, Animal goddesses

In Hinduism, Aranyani is a goddess of the forests and the animals that dwell within them.
Aranyani has the distinction of having one of the most descriptive hymns in the Rigveda dedicated to her, in which she is described as being elusive, fond of quiet glades in the jungle, and fearless of remote places. In the hymn, the supplicant entreats her to explain how she wanders so far from the fringe of civilisation without becoming afraid or lonely. She wears anklets with bells, and though seldom seen, she can be heard by the tinkling of her anklets.The Hymns of the Rigveda, Ralph T.H. Griffith, 1973. Hymn CXLVI, Page 640 She is also described as a dancer. Her ability to feed both man and animals though she 'tills no lands' is what the supplicant finds most marvellous. The hymn is repeated in Taittiriya Brahmana and interpreted by the commentator of that work.[tpl]cite book|last=Muir|first=John|title=Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India|year=1870|publisher=Trubner and Co|location=London|pages=422|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ymLZAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl]  
Aranyani bears resemblance to later day forest deities like Bonobibi in Bengal and Vana Durga. Her worship has declined in modern day Hinduism, and it is rare to find a temple dedicated to Aranyani.

Sammo Hung (born January 7, 1952), also known as Hung Kam-bo (洪金寶), is a Hong Kong actor, martial artist, film producer and director, known for his work in many martial arts films and Hong Kong action cinema. He has been a fight choreographer for, amongst others, Jackie Chan, King Hu, and John Woo.
Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and started the vampire-like jiangshi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew.
In East Asia, it is common for people to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect.

The airport name derives from the adjacent district of Barajas, which has its own metro station on the same rail line serving the airport.
The Madrid–Barcelona air shuttle service, known as the "Puente Aéreo" (in Spanish), literally called "Air Bridge", is the second busiest air route in Europe after İstanbul Atatürk and İzmir,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/press-releases/west-east-traffic-shift-continues-summer-2012 |title=10 busiest airport pairs per number of daily flights |publisher=Eurocontrol|date=[/tpl] with the highest number of flight operations (55 daily) in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oag.com/oag/website/com/OAG+Data/News/Press+Room/Press+Releases+2007/OAG+reveals+latest+industry+intelligence+on+the+busiest+routes+2109072 |title=OAG reveals latest industry intelligence on the busiest routes |publisher=Oag.com |date=[/tpl] The schedule has been reduced since February 2008, when the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line was opened, covering the distance in 2½ hours, and quickly became popular. Barajas serves as the gateway to the Iberian peninsula from the rest of Europe and the world, and is a particularly key link between Europe and Latin America. The airport is the primary hub and maintenance base for Iberia. Consequently, Iberia is responsible for more than 60 percent of Barajas' traffic.

This renaming seeks recognition for Suárez's role as the first Prime Minister of Spain after the restoration of democracy and his key participation in the Spanish Transition to Democracy after Franco's Dictatorship. Further details on the renaming process are still unknown.

Opus Dei, formally known as The Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei ([tpl]lang-la|Praelatura Sanctae Crucis et Operis Dei[/tpl]), is an institution of the Roman Catholic Church that teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20021007_opus-dei_en.html | title=Address of John Paul II in Praise of St. Josemaría, Founder of Opus Dei | accessdate=2007-06-08[/tpl] The majority of its membership are lay people, with secular priests under the governance of a prelate (bishop) elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope.Upon whom does the prelate of Opus Dei depend?

Founded in Spain in 1928 by the Catholic priest Josemaría Escrivá, Opus Dei was given final Catholic Church approval in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. In 1982, by decision of Pope John Paul II, the Catholic Church made it into a personal prelature—that is, the jurisdiction of its own bishop covers the persons in Opus Dei wherever they are, rather than geographical dioceses.
As of 2012, members of the Prelature numbered 91,960. Lay persons, men and women, numbered 89,909, while there were 2,051 priests. These figures do not include the diocesan priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005. Members are in more than 90 countries. About 70 per cent of Opus Dei members live in their private homes, leading traditional Catholic family lives with secular careers,[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/opusdei.shtml | work=BBC Religion and Ethics|title=Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/mar/24/terry-mattingly-da-vinci-code-mania-opened-opus-de/ | work=Alburquerque Tribune|title='Da Vinci Code' mania opened up Opus Dei|author=Terry Mattingly | accessdate=2007-04-02[/tpl] while the other 30 per cent are celibate, of whom the majority live in Opus Dei centres.

Criticism of Opus Dei has centered on allegations of secretiveness, controversial recruiting methods, strict rules governing members, elitism and misogyny, and support of or participation in authoritarian or right-wing governments, especially the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978. The mortification of the flesh practiced by some of its members is also criticized.

[[Mortification of the flesh]]

CATEGORIES: Asceticism, Catholic penitential practices, Religious behaviour and experience, Christian terms

Mortification of the flesh is the institutional expiatory self-flagellation of a person or group's penance for atonement of sins and path to sanctity. The term is primarily used in religious and spiritual contexts. The practice is found in many cultures, most notably the Roman Catholic Church and their penitential saints. The more common forms of mortification today include fasting, walking barefoot, motion by pious kneeling or laying face down on the floor. Also common amongst religious orders in the past were the wearing of sack garments, and flagellation in imitation of Jesus Christ's suffering and death by crucifixion. Some forms unique to some Asian cultures are carrying heavy loads and immersion in water.

[[Protected area]]

CATEGORIES: Protected areas, Land use

Protected areas or natural parks are locations which receive protection because of their recognised natural, ecological and/or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term "protected area" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010)Protected Planet with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area.Soutullo, A. 2010.

Protected areas are essential for biodiversity conservation. They are the cornerstones of virtually all national and international conservation strategies. They are areas set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems, to act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act as benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural world. Today they are often the only hope we have of stopping many threatened or endangered species from becoming extinct.Dudley, N. (ed.)

[[Protected areas of the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Protected areas of the United Kingdom, United Kingdom-related lists

Protected areas of the United Kingdom are areas in the United Kingdom which need and /or receive protection because of their environmental, historical or cultural value to the nation. Methods and aims of protection vary depending on the nature and importance of the resource. Protection operates at local, regional, national and international levels, and may be backed by legislation and international treaty, or less formally by planning policy. 
Within the United Kingdom, different approaches are taken to some forms of protection within the constituent countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, while other forms of protection are more consistent across the UK. Protected areas can be divided according to the type of resource which each seeks to protect. Primarily, these are: scenic or landscape value; biodiversity value (species and habitats); geodiversity value (relating to geology and geomorphology); and cultural or historic value. Several types of protected areas are focused on more than one of these areas. 
Besides protected areas, a number of individual features are protected through other designations, such as tree preservation orders, listed buildings, and protected shipwrecks.

[[Lynching]]

CATEGORIES: Lynchings

Lynching is murder by mob, often by hanging, but also by burning at the stake or shooting, in order to punish an alleged transgressor, or to intimidate, control, or otherwise manipulate a specific sector of a population. It is related to other means of social control such as charivari, Skimmington, riding the rail, and tarring and feathering, but with a drift toward the public spectacle.[tpl]cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701719807 | title=Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947 | publisher=North Carolina University Press | author=Wood, Amy Louise | year=2009 | isbn=9780807878118[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://dennisrhidalgo.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/lynching-and-the-susquehannocks/ | title=Lynching and the Susquehannocks | publisher=Wordpress | work=Blog | date=November 27, 2013 | accessdate=28 November 2013 | author=Hidalgo, Dennis Ricardo[/tpl] Lynchings have been more frequent in times of social and economic tension, and have often been a means for a dominant group to suppress challengers. However, it has also resulted from long-held prejudices and practices of discrimination that have conditioned societies to accept this type of violence as normal practices of popular justice. Though racial oppression and the frontier mentality in the United States have given lynching its current familiar face, execution by mob justice is not exclusive to North America, but it is also found around the world as vigilantes act to punish people behaving outside of commonly acceptable boundaries. Indeed, instances of it can be found in societies long antedating European settlement of North America.Berg, Manfred and Simon Wendt. 2011.

The legal and cultural antecedents of American lynching were carried across the Atlantic by migrants from the British Isles to colonial North America. Collective violence was a familiar aspect of the early modern Anglo-American legal landscape. Group violence in the British Atlantic was usually nonlethal in intention and consequence but it occasionally shaded, particularly in the seventeenth century in the context of political turmoil in England and unsettled social and political conditions in the American colonies, into rebellions and riots that took multiple lives.[tpl]cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724308353 | title=The roots of rough justice : origins of American lynching | publisher=University of Illinois Press | author=Pfeifer, Michael J. | year=2011 | location=Urbana, Illinois | isbn=9780252093098[/tpl] During the Antebellum, assertive free-Blacks, Latinos in the South West and runaways were the object of racial lynching.[tpl]cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/815043342 | title=Forgotten dead : mob violence against Mexicans in the United States, 1848-1928 | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Carrigan, William D.; Clive Webb | year=2013 | location=Oxford | isbn=9780195320350[/tpl] But lynching attacks on  U.S. blacks, especially in the South, increased dramatically in the aftermath of the Civil War, after slavery had been abolished and recently freed black men gained the right to vote. Violence rose even more at the end of the 19th century, after southern white Democrats regained their political power in the South in the 1870s. States passed new constitutions or legislation which effectively disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites, established segregation of public facilities by race, and separated blacks from common public life and facilities. Nearly 3,500 African Americans and 1,300 whites were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968, mostly from 1882 to 1920.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882-1968 |author= |pages= |accessdate=July 26, 2010 |quote=Statistics provided  by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute. |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law [/tpl]
Lynching during the 19th century in the British Empire coincided with a period of violence which denied people participation in white-dominated society on the basis of race after the Emancipation Act of 1833.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Thomas E.|last=Smith|title=The Discourse of Violence: Transatlantic Narratives of Lynching during High Imperialism|work=Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History|volume=8|issue=2|date=Fall 2007|doi=10.1353/cch.2007.0040|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press[/tpl]
Although some white Southerners attempted to justify lynching by referring to rape, less than a quarter of lynchings resulted from accusations that a black man had raped a white woman; in fact, most black men were lynched for allegedly having assaulted or murdered white men.http://books.google.com/books?id=mq06NDClzZUC&pg=PA175&dq=accusations+lynching+rape&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JQClUp35Eq7LsAS_g4D4AQ&ved=0CEkQ6wEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=accusations%20lynching%20rape&f=false
Today lynching is a felony in all states of the United States, defined by some codes of law as "any act of violence inflicted by a mob upon the body of another person which results in the death of the person", with a "mob" being defined as "the assemblage of two or more persons, without color or authority of law, for the premeditated purpose and with the premeditated intent of committing an act of violence upon the person of another". Lynching in the second degree is defined as "any act of violence inflicted by a mob upon the body of another person and from which death does not result".S.C. Code of Laws Title 16 Chapter 3 Offenses Against the Person To sustain a conviction for lynching, at least some evidence of premeditation must be produced, but "the common intent to do violence" may be formed before or during the assemblage.State v.

CATEGORIES: Espionage scandals and incidents, Political sex scandals in the United Kingdom, History of the Conservative Party (UK), Soviet Union–United Kingdom relations, 1963 in the United Kingdom, 1963 in international relations, 1963 in politics

The Profumo affair was a British political scandal that originated with a brief sexual liaison in 1961 between John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War in Harold Macmillan's government, and Christine Keeler, a 19-year-old would-be model. In March 1963 Profumo denied any impropriety in a personal statement[tpl]#tag:ref|In the UK parliament, the "personal statement" is a device whereby a member can make a point of a personal nature, to correct an earlier mistake, to confirm or deny a rumour, or to apologise for giving offence. According to the political journalist Wayland Young, because members are by tradition never questioned on such statements, they are "occasions for a special degree of truthfulness".Young, p. 17|group= n[/tpl] to the House of Commons, but was forced to admit the truth a few weeks later. He resigned from the government and from Parliament. The repercussions of the affair severely damaged Macmillan's self-confidence, and he resigned as prime minister on health grounds in October 1963. His Conservative party was marked by the scandal, which may have contributed to its defeat by Labour in the 1964 general election.
When the Profumo–Keeler affair was first revealed, public interest was heightened by reports that Keeler may have been simultaneously involved  with Captain Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet naval attaché, thereby creating a possible security risk. Keeler knew both Profumo and Ivanov through her friendship with Stephen Ward, an osteopath and socialite who had taken her under his wing.  The exposure of the affair generated rumours of other scandals, and drew official attention to the activities of Ward, who was charged with a series of immorality offences.  Perceiving himself as a scapegoat for the misdeeds of others, Ward took a fatal overdose during the final stages of his trial, which found him guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies.
An inquiry into the affair by a senior judge, Lord Denning, indicated that there had been no breaches of security arising from the Ivanov connection. Profumo subsequently sought private atonement as a volunteer worker at Toynbee Hall, an East London charitable trust. By 1975 he had been officially rehabilitated, although he did not return to public life. He died, honoured and respected, in 2006.  Keeler found it difficult to escape the negative image attached to her by press, law and parliament throughout the Profumo affair. In various, sometimes contradictory accounts, she has challenged Denning's conclusions relating to security issues. Ward's conviction has been described by analysts as an act of Establishment revenge, rather than serving justice. In January 2014 his case was under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, with the possibility of a later reference to the Court of Appeal. Dramatisations of the Profumo affair have been shown on stage and screen.

Early European accounts used the word for a different location, describing a medium-sized island (Isle de Bifeche) in the delta of the Senegal River in West Africa,  some two miles upstream from the island of N'Dar on which Saint-Louis was founded. The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge described the island in 1843 as being "entirely covered with wood, and in the wet season a great portion of them is laid under water." http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&vid=0djgIW4z6KSBHnBRiUG&id=FtYtp9FJcuYC&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=Bifeche&vq=Bifeche&prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3DBifeche

In the 17th century a chief known as the Petit Brak or Little King ruled over a region known variously as Biffeche or Gangueul with capital at Maka.  The Grand Brak or Big King ruled the kingdom of Waalo, whose capital was originally at Diourbel. The area was nearly depopulated by repeated slaving raids by Moors from the north.  At times, the Petit Brak was tributary to Waalo, at other times allied with Bethio. In the 1720s, the Brak of Waalo was Erim M'Bagnick and Béquio Malicouri, king of the Royaume d'Oral (Bethio), was his vassal.

[[Bethio]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Senegal, History of Senegal, Kingdoms of Senegal, French West Africa

The Principality of Bethio (also spelled Bequio, Bekio, Bitio, Bétio or Beetyo) was a small monarchy located for centuries along the lower Senegal River valley, on the border between modern Mauritania and Senegal, in the northeast of Biffeche.  In the 18th century it was also called the "Royaume d'Oral".  Its capital was at Poum, then moved to N'Dombo, and finally moved to Ross, Senegal in the 19th century (called Ross-Bethio since then).  The original, fertile farmlands of Bethio are in a region just east of the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary.
In the 1720s, the Brak (king) of Oualo (Waalo) was Erim M'Bagnick (Yérim Mbañik) and Béquio Malicouri king of the Royaume d'Oral was his vassal.  The latter appears to have been succeeded by Fara Coro.
In the 18th century the most famous "Prince Bethio" was Maalixuri (Malichouri) (Malikhuri Diop ) who was legendary for his cleverness, changes of strategy, and defiance in disputes with the Kingdom of Waalo and with the French at Saint-Louis, Senegal.
Today, Abdoulaye Diop, the current Prince Bethio, lives at Ross-Bethio where he is a  Senegalese political leader.

Su Zhu (16 February 1921 – 20 August 2008), better known by the nom de guerre Hua Guofeng, was Mao Zedong's designated successor as the paramount leader of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Communist Party of China.
A regional official in Hunan between 1949 and 1971, he became the head of the party leadership in the province during the latter stages of the Cultural Revolution. Hua was elevated to the national stage in early 1976, and was known for his loyalty to Mao. Upon Zhou Enlai's death in January 1976, Hua succeeded Zhou as Premier of the People's Republic of China. After Mao's death, Hua took on the titles of Chairman of the Communist Party of China and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, to the surprise and dismay of Jiang Qing and the rest of the Gang of Four. Hua is the only leader to have simultaneously held the three highest offices of the PRC – leading the Communist Party, State Council and the Central Military Commission.
On 6 October 1976, Hua brought the Cultural Revolution to an end and ousted the Gang of Four from political power by arranging for their arrests in Beijing. He attempted moderate reforms and reversing some of the excesses of Cultural Revolution-era policies. However, because of his insistence on continuing the Maoist line, he was himself outmaneuvered in December 1978 by Deng Xiaoping, a pragmatic reformer, who forced Hua into early retirement. As Hua faded into political obscurity, he continued to insist on the correctness of Maoist principles. He is remembered as a largely benign transitional figure in modern Chinese political history.

Though there is no certain agreement as to their purpose, it is thought that they may have bell towers, places of refuge, or both.
Generally found in the vicinity of a church or monastery, the door of the tower faces the west doorway of the church.  In this way it has been possible to determine without excavation the approximate site of lost churches, where the tower still exists.

The Anarchy was a war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1154, characterised by a breakdown in law and order. The conflict originated with a succession crisis towards the end of the reign of Henry I, when the king's only legitimate son, William Adelin, died aboard the White Ship in 1120. Henry's attempts to install his daughter, the Empress Matilda, as his successor were unsuccessful and on Henry's death in 1135, his nephew Stephen of Blois took power with the help of his brother, Henry of Winchester. Stephen's early reign was marked by fierce fighting with English barons, rebellious Welsh leaders and Scottish invaders. Following a major rebellion in the south-west of England, Matilda invaded in 1139 with the help of her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester.
Neither side was able to achieve a decisive advantage during the first years of the war; the Empress came to control the south-west of England and much of the Thames Valley, while Stephen remained in control of the south-east. The castles of the period were easily defensible, and much of the fighting was attritional in character, comprising sieges, raiding and skirmishing between armies of knights and footsoldiers, many of them mercenaries. In 1141 Stephen was captured following the battle of Lincoln, causing a collapse in his authority over most of the country. The Empress Matilda was forced to retreat from London by hostile crowds before she could be crowned queen; shortly afterwards, Robert was captured at the rout of Winchester and the two sides agreed to swap their respective captives. Stephen almost seized Matilda in 1142 during the siege of Oxford, but the Empress escaped from Oxford Castle across the frozen River Thames to safety.
The war dragged on for many more years. Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, successfully conquered Normandy, but in England neither side could achieve victory. Rebel barons began to acquire ever greater power in northern England and in East Anglia, with widespread devastation in the regions of major fighting. In 1148 the Empress returned to Normandy, leaving the campaigning in England to her young son, Henry Fitzempress. Stephen unsuccessfully attempted to have his own son, Eustace, recognised by the Church as the next king of England. By the early 1150s the barons and the Church mostly wanted a long-term peace.
When Henry re-invaded England in 1153, neither faction's forces were keen to fight. After limited campaigning and the siege of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry agreed a negotiated peace, the Treaty of Winchester, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir. Stephen died the next year and Henry II began the long period of reconstruction in England. Chroniclers described the period as one in which "Christ and his saints were asleep" and Victorian historians called the conflict "the Anarchy" because of the chaos, although modern historians have questioned the accuracy of the term and some contemporary accounts.Bradbury, p.215.

Sheringham Park is a landscape park and gardens near the town of Sheringham, Norfolk, England.Ordnance Survey (2002). OS Explorer Map 252 - Norfolk Coast East. ISBN 0-319-21888-0. The park surrounds Sheringham Hall and has a grid reference of [tpl]gbmappingsmall|TG133416[/tpl]. The Hall is privately occupied, but Sheringham Park is in the care of the National Trust and open to visitors.
The park was designed by Humphry ReptonLandscapes of Taste: The Art of Humphry Repton's Red Books (Classical Tradition in Architecture) (Hardcover) ISBN 0-415-41503-9 who presented his proposals in July 1812 in the form of one of his Red Books.

There are fine mature woodlands and a large variety of rhododendrons and azaleas. In the early 20th century Henry Morris Upcher obtained rhododendron seeds of various types from plantsman Ernest "Chinese" Wilson. Plants from this source which can found at the garden include Rhododendron ambiguum, calophytum and decorum, among others.Zealand. K. National Trust–Sheringham Park guide (1998) Retrieved 25 November 2008 Many other species of tree and shrub are represented in the garden,including fifteen kinds of magnolia, large specimen pieris. Among the other trees are maples, acers, styrax, eucryphia, Pocket Handkerchief Tree davidia involucrata and a fine example of the Snowdrop Tree Halesia. Several overlook towers provide good views over the gardens, and of the nearby coast and surrounding countryside. A garden temple was constructed in the Park in 1975.

The Kingdom of Cayor (1549-1879) was the largest and most powerful kingdom that split off from the Empire of Jolof (Diolof), in what is now Senegal.  Cayor was located in north and central Senegal, southeast of Waalo, west of the kingdom of Jolof and north of Baol and the Kingdom of Sine.
In 1549, the king, or "Damel", Detie Fu Ndiogu, became independent from Jolof (Djolof).  The capital was at Mboul.  After the French conquered Waalo, governor Louis Faidherbe annexed Cayor in 1868, but Cayor got its independence restored in 1871.  It was defeated and annexed again in 1879 and ceased to be a sovereign state.  The kingdom was extinguished in its entirety October 6, 1886.
In addition to Cayor, the Damels also ruled over the Lebou area at Cap-Vert (where modern Dakar is), and they became the "Teignes" (rulers) of the neighboring kingdom of Baol.
Traditionally the Damel himself was not purely hereditary, but was designated by a 4-member council consisting of:
A great hero in Senegal history, for his defiance and battles against the French, was Lat Dyor Diop (Lat Dior)  He was defeated at the battle of Dekheule, and was deposed twice, in 1869 and 1879.  He converted to Islam  around 1861.
The 30th and last Damel of Cayor was Samba Laobe Fall (1858-1886), killed at Tivaouane, Senegal.

It consists of bird lagoons and bird observation hides, including a rotary hide. The Snettisham coast around the reserve is often said to be "where Norfolk stares at Lincolnshire". This is because, unlike much of Norfolk's coast where the sea stretches to the horizon, Snettisham looks across the square-mouthed estuary of The Wash at the county of Lincolnshire, only [tpl]convert|15|mi[/tpl] away. The River Ingol runs to the south of the village upon which stands the now unused Snettisham watermill. This is now in the process of being renovated (October 2011).

The Snettisham Hoard is a series of discoveries of Iron Age precious metal, including nearly 180 gold torques, 75 complete and the rest fragmentary, found in the area between 1948 to 1973. In 1985 there was also a find of Romano-British jewellery and raw materials buried in a clay pot in AD 155, the Snettisham Jeweller's Hoard.

Edvard Alexander Westermarck (20 November 1862 – 3 September 1939) was a Finnish philosopher and sociologist. Among other subjects, he studied exogamy and the incest taboo.
The phenomenon of reverse sexual imprinting (when two people live in close domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one, both are desensitized to later close sexual attraction), now known as the Westermarck effect, was first formally described by him in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891). 
He has been described as "first Darwinian sociologist" or "the first sociobiologist".Sanderson, SK. "REFORMING THEORETICAL WORK IN SOCIOLOGY: A DETAILED REPLY TO MY CRITICS" 
He helped found academic sociology in the United Kingdom, becoming the first professor of sociology (with Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse) in 1907 in the University of London.
In the UK, his name is often spelled Edward. His sister, Helena Westermarck, was a writer and artist.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl]

Iodothyronine deiodinases ([tpl]EC number|1.97.1.10[/tpl] and [tpl]EC number|1.97.1.11[/tpl]) are a subfamily of deiodinase enzymes important in the activation and deactivation of thyroid hormones. thyroxine (T4), the precursor of 3,5,3’-triiodothyronine (T3) is transformed into T3 by deiodinase activity.  T3, through binding a nuclear thyroid hormone receptor, influences the expression of genes in practically every vertebrate cell.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bianco AC, Kim BW | title = Deiodinases: implications of the local control of thyroid hormone action | journal = J.

These enzymes are not to be confused with the iodotyrosine deiodinases that are also deiodinases, but not members of the iodothyronine family. The iodotyrosine deiodinases (unlike the iodothyronine deiodinases) do not use selenocysteine or selenium. The iodotryrosine enzymes work on iodinated single tyrosine residue molecules to scavenge iodine, and do not use as substrates the double-tyrosine residue molecules of the various iodothyronines.

[[Filter (Unix)]]

CATEGORIES: Unix

In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, a filter is a program that gets most of its data from its standard input (the main input stream) and writes its main results to its standard output (the main output stream). Unix filters are often used as elements of pipelines. The pipe operator ("|") on a command line signifies that the main output of the command to the left is passed as main input to the command on the right.
The classic filter would be grep, which at it simplest prints to its output any lines containing a character string. The following is an example:
This finds all registered users that have "foo" as part of their username by using the cut command to take the first field (username) of each line of the Unix system password file and passing them all as input to grep, which searches its input for lines containing the character string "foo" and prints them on its output.
Common Unix filter programs are: cat, cut, grep, head, sort, uniq, and tail. Programs like awk and sed can be used to build quite complex filters because they are fully programmable. Unix filters can be also used by Data Scientists to get a quick overview about a file based dataset.Data Analysis with the Unix Shell - Bernd Zuther, comSysto GmbH, 2013

The word Dymaxion is a term that Buckminster Fuller used for several of his inventions.  It is a portmanteau of the words dynamic, maximum, and tension.
A brand name was needed for the display of Fuller's first architectural model, later to be known as the Dymaxion house, at the Marshall Field's department store in Chicago.
In order to invent a word, a wordsmith hired by Marshall Field's spent two days listening to Fuller and trying to get a feel for the type of language he used.  He then played with syllables from typical Fuller words, until he and Fuller agreed on the word "Dymaxion".
Fuller was excited about the word and used it for many of his inventions during the decades to follow, including the Dymaxion house, the Dymaxion car, and the Dymaxion World Map. Dymaxion also came to describe a polyphasic sleep schedule he followed, consisting of four 30 minute naps throughout the day. He also renamed his elaborate journal, in which he sought to document his life as an experiment with the greatest possible detail, as the Dymaxion Chronofile.

Max Weinberg (born April 13, 1951) is an American drummer and television personality, most widely known as the longtime drummer for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and as the bandleader for Conan O'Brien on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.
Weinberg grew up in suburban New Jersey and began drumming at an early age. He attended college planning to be a lawyer but got his big break in music in 1974 when he won an audition to become the drummer for Springsteen. His powerful but controlled playing on albums such as Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A. stabilized the E Street Band sound and Weinberg became a mainstay of Springsteen's long concert performances.  Springsteen dissolved the band in 1989 and Weinberg spent several years considering a law career and trying the business end of the music industry before deciding he wanted to continue with drumming.
In 1993, Weinberg was given the role as bandleader of The Max Weinberg 7 for Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Weinberg's drums-driven jump blues sound and his role as a comic foil prospered along with the show, giving him a second career. In 1999, Springsteen reformed the E Street Band for a series of tours and albums; Weinberg worked out an arrangement that allowed him to play with both O'Brien and Springsteen. In 2009, Weinberg moved to the short-lived Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien as leader of Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. After that ended, he formed and toured with a new ensemble, the Max Weinberg Big Band, and in 2010 chose not to follow O'Brien to the new Conan show.
In 2014, Weinberg was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band.

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics, Physical cosmology, General relativity

In relativistic cosmology, Weyl's postulate stipulates that in a fluid cosmological model, the world lines of the fluid particles, which act as the source of the gravitational field and which are often taken to model galaxies, should be hypersurface orthogonal.  That is, the world lines should be everywhere orthogonal to a family of spatial hyperslices.
Sometimes, the additional hypothesis is added that the world lines form timelike geodesics.

The Dymaxion House was developed by inventor and architect Buckminster Fuller to address several perceived shortcomings with existing homebuilding techniques. Fuller designed several versions of the house at different times — all of them factory manufactured kits, assembled on site, intended to be suitable for any site or environment and to use resources efficiently. A key design consideration of the design was ease of shipment and assembly.
Fuller created the term Dymaxion, a portmanteau of the words dynamic, maximum, and tension, to describe many of his inventions.

Ardhanarishvara ([tpl]lang-sa|अर्धनारीश्वर[/tpl], [tpl]IAST|Ardhanārīśvara[/tpl]), is a composite androgynous form of the Hindu god Shiva and his consort Parvati (also known as Devi, Shakti and Uma in this icon). Ardhanarishvara is depicted as half male and half female, split down the middle. The right half is usually the male Shiva, illustrating his traditional attributes.
The earliest Ardhanarishvara images are dated to the Kushan period, starting from the first century CE. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era. The Puranas and various iconographic treatises write about the mythology and iconography of Ardhanarishvara. While Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, very few temples are dedicated to this deity.
Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara is a symbol of Shiva's all-pervasive nature.

[[Guardians of the directions]]
CATEGORIES: Guardians of the directions, Buddhist cosmology, Hindu gods, Lokapalas

The Guardians of the Directions (Sanskrit: दिक्पाल, Dikpāla) are the deities who rule the specific directions of space according to Hinduism and [tpl]IAST|Vajrayāna[/tpl] Buddhism—especially [tpl]IAST|Kālacakra[/tpl]. As a group of eight deities, they are called [tpl]IAST|Aṣṭa-Dikpāla[/tpl] (अष्ट-दिक्पाल), literally meaning guardians of eight directions. They are often augmented with two extra deities for the ten directions (the two extra directions being zenith and nadir), when they are known as the [tpl]IAST|Daśa-dikpāla[/tpl]. In Hinduism it is traditional to represent their images on the walls and ceilings of Hindu temples. Ancient Java and Bali Hinduism recognize [tpl]IAST|Nava-Dikpāla[/tpl], literally meaning guardians of nine directions, that consist of eight directions with one addition in the center. The nine guardian gods of directions is called Dewata Nawa Sanga (Nine guardian devata), the diagram of these guardian gods of directions is featured in Surya Majapahit, the emblem of Majapahit empire.
There are strong similarities between the concept of the guardians of the directions and the lore surrounding the Chinese four symbols, four ancestral spirits who are responsible for four of the cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West).

[[Nirṛti]]
CATEGORIES: Hindu goddesses, Death goddesses, Guardians of the directions

In Hinduism, [tpl]IAST|Nirṛti[/tpl] निरृति is the goddess of death and corruption, one of the dikpāla (Guardians of the directions), representing the southwest (or—according Monier-Williams’s Sanskrit-English Dictionary—the south). The name [tpl]IAST|nir−ṛt-[/tpl] has the meaning of "absence of ṛta, lawless". The masculine form of the name, [tpl]IAST|Nirṛta[/tpl], is a name of Rudra.
Nirṛti is mentioned in a few hymns of the Rigveda, mostly to seek protection from her or imploring for her departure. In one hymn (X.59), she is mentioned several times. This hymn, after summing up her nature, also asks for her departure from the sacrificial site. In the Atharva Veda (V.7.9), she is described as having golden locks. In the Taittiriya Brahmana (I.6.1.4), Nirṛti is described as dark, dressed in dark clothes and her sacrificial shares are dark husks. In the Shatapatha Brahmana (X.1.2.9), she is associated with pain and as the southwest quarter is her region, pain is associated with the southwest. But elsewhere in the same text (V.2.3.3.) she is mentioned as living in the south, the direction of the kingdom of the dead.Kinsley, David (1987, reprint 2005).

Albert Baldwin Wood (December 1, 1879 – May 10, 1956) was an inventor and engineer from New Orleans, Louisiana. He graduated from Tulane University with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 1899.
Wood was hired by the Sewerage & Water Board of New Orleans in 1899 to try to improve the flood-prone city's drainage, Wood invented "flapgates" and other hydraulic devices, most notably efficient low maintenance high volume pumps, including the Wood Screw Pump (1913) and the Wood Trash Pump (1915). Wood spearheaded the reclamation from swamp and the efforts to develop much of the land now occupied by the city of New Orleans. 
While he spent most of his career in New Orleans, Wood also consulted and designed the drainage, pumping, and sewage systems for other locations including Chicago, Milwaukee, Baltimore, San Francisco, as well as projects in Canada, Egypt, China, and India. His work was especially helpful in the Zuiderzee Works, which reclaimed large areas of land from the Zuider Zee in the Netherlands.
Some of Wood's pumps have been in almost continuous use in New Orleans for over 80 years without need of repairs, and new ones continue to be built from his designs.
When Wood died, he left a bequest to Tulane University on the condition that it preserve and display his sailing boat, the Nydia, for 99 years. Until 2003, the boat was housed in a specially constructed glass-fronted display area located between the University Center and Fogelman Arena. It was moved to make room for the renovation and expansion of the University Center. Because Tulane did not fully adhere to the terms of the will, Wood's heirs have recovered possession of the boat through legal means. The Nydia is on display at the Biloxi Maritime and Seafood Industry Museum in Biloxi, MS, not far from where the boat was originally constructed at the Johnson Shipyard.BALDWIN WOOD’S NYDIA – New Orleans Magazine

He is also said to have first instituted the fire-sacrifice or yagna. Sometimes he is also reckoned among the seven seers or Saptarishi. His clan is known as the Atharvanas. Atharvan married Chitti, daughter of Kardama rishi, and had a great sage Dadhichi as a son.
He was referred to as a member of the Bhrigu clan.
According to mundaka upnisad and other texts, he was eldest son & (Manas putra) born from mind  of the brahma.
Vedic atharvan is cognate with Avestan āθrauuan / aθaurun, "priest", but the etymology of the term is not yet conclusively established. "Attempts have been made to connect the term with Avestan atar- "fire" (not attested in Vedic); but these have been prompted by what is probably a mistaken assumption of the importance of fire in the ancient Indo-Iranian religion."

By the 20th century, there has been an increase in the number of worshipers of Ayyappan from many different groups, spurred by vast improvements in transport and communication in southern India.Local Deities India
Ayyappan's annual festival is a time of pilgrimage for ever-growing numbers of men from throughout South India.

The Constitution of RomaniaAt article 12, clause 1 provides that “The flag of Romania is tricolour; the colors are arranged vertically in the following order from the flagpole: blue, yellow, red”. The proportions, shades of color as well as the flag protocol were established by law in 1994Law no. 75 of 16 July 1994, published in Monitorul Oficial no. 237 of 26 August 1994. and extended in 2001.Governmental Decision no. 1157/2001, published in Monitorul Oficial no. 776 of 5 December 2001.
The flag is coincidentally very similar to the civil flag of Andorra and the state flag of Chad. The similarity with Chad’s flag, which differs only in having a darker shade of blue (indigo rather than cobalt), has caused international discussion. In 2004, Chad asked the United Nations to examine the issue, but then-president of Romania Ion Iliescu announced no change would occur to the flag."'Identical flag' causes flap in Romania" The flag of Moldova is related to the Romanian tricolour, except it has a 1:2 ratio, a lighter shade of blue, a slightly different tint of yellow, and the Moldavian coat of arms in the middle.

First sprung forth in the post-Puranic age, around 6th century C.E., it was a new theistic movement in which the supreme being was envisioned as female. A fact epitomized by texts like Devi-Bhagavata Purana, especially its last nine chapters (31-40) of the seventh skandha, which are known as the Devi Gita, and soon became central texts of Shaktism.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OxayHczql9EC|title=The Devī Gītā: The Song of the Goddess|last=Brown|first=Charles Mackenzie|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791439401|page=23[/tpl]

Noted for its performance and accuracy, it enjoys widespread use. However, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance,
although other work has found A* to be superior to other approaches.
Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) first described the algorithm in 1968. It is an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's 1959 algorithm. A* achieves better time performance by using heuristics.

[[Dhumavati]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu goddesses, Forms of Parvati, Mahavidyas, Widowhood in India

Dhumavati ([tpl]lang-sa|धूमावती[/tpl], [tpl]IAST|Dhūmāvatī[/tpl], literally "the smoky one") is one of the Mahavidyas, a group of ten Tantric goddesses. Dhumavati represents the fearsome aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is often portrayed as an old, ugly widow, and is associated with things considered inauspicious and unattractive in Hinduism, such as the crow and the Chaturmas period. The goddess is often depicted on a horseless chariot or riding a crow, usually in a cremation ground.
Dhumavati is said to manifest herself at the time of cosmic dissolution (pralaya) and is "the Void" that exists before creation and after dissolution. While Dhumavati is generally associated with only inauspicious qualities, her thousand-name hymn relates her positive aspects as well as her negative ones. She is often called tender-hearted and a bestower of boons. Dhumavati is described as a great teacher, one who reveals ultimate knowledge of the universe, which is beyond the illusory divisions, like auspicious and inauspicious. Her ugly form teaches the devotee to look beyond the superficial, to look inwards and seek the inner truths of life.
Dhumavati is described as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles, and a granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Her worship is also prescribed for those who wish to defeat their foes. Dhumavati's worship is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as Tantrikas. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires the status of a local protective deity. There, even married couples worship her. Although she has very few dedicated temples, her worship by Tantric ritual continues in private in secluded places like cremation grounds and forests.

[[System on a chip]]
CATEGORIES: Electronic design, Microtechnology, System on a chip

A system on a chip or system on chip (SoC or SOC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that integrates all components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip. It may contain digital, analog, mixed-signal, and often radio-frequency functions—all on a single chip substrate. A typical application is in the area of embedded systems.
The contrast with a microcontroller is one of degree. Microcontrollers typically have under 100 kB of RAM (often just a few kilobytes) and often really are single-chip-systems, whereas the term SoC is typically used for more powerful processors, capable of running software such as the desktop versions of Windows and Linux, which need external memory chips (flash, RAM) to be useful, and which are used with various external peripherals. In short, for larger systems, the term system on a chip is a hyperbole, indicating technical direction more than reality: increasing chip integration to reduce manufacturing costs and to enable smaller systems. Many interesting systems are too complex to fit on just one chip built with a process optimized for just one of the system's tasks.
When it is not feasible to construct a SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a system in package (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single package. In large volumes, SoC is believed to be more cost-effective than SiP since it increases the yield of the fabrication and because its packaging is simpler.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4052047/The-Great-Debate-SOC-vs-SIP |title=The Great Debate: SOC vs. SIP |publisher=EE Times |date= |accessdate=2009-08-12[/tpl]
Another option, as seen for example in higher end cell phones and on the BeagleBoard, is package on package stacking during board assembly. The SoC chip includes processors and numerous digital peripherals, and comes in a ball grid package with lower and upper connections. The lower balls connect to the board and various peripherals, with the upper balls in a ring holding the memory buses used to access NAND flash and DDR2 RAM. Memory packages could come from multiple vendors.

[[Buddhi]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu theology

Buddhi is a feminine Sanskrit noun derived from the same root as the more familiar masculine form Buddha (In Samkhya and yogic philosophy both the mind and the ego are forms in the realm of nature (prakriti) that have emerged into materiality as a function of the three gunas through a misapprehension of purusha (the consciousness-essence of the jivatman). Discriminative in nature (बुद्धि निश्चयात्मिका चित्त-वृत्ति), buddhi is that which is able to discern truth (satya) from falsehood and thereby to make wisdom possible. It corresponds to the Platonic conception of nous. Just as nous plays a critical role in salvation in orthodox Christianity,See the writings of the Philokalia so too does buddhi play an important role in liberation (i.e., enlightenment) within Hinduism, Buddhism and Yoga. 
Buddhi makes its first scriptural appearance in the Katha Upanishad (I,3), where it is compared in a famous simile to the driver of a horse and carriage. The reins held by the driver represent the lower mind (manas), the horses represent the five senses (indriya), and the carriage represents the body. Ontologically buddhi is equivalent to hiranyagarbha: it is to individual living souls (jivas) what hiranyagarbha is to the insentient phenomena of the universe. Buddhi is that dimension (or pole) of the heart/mind (chitta) that is attracted to Brahman. The other pole of chitta, manas, is characterised by ego-construction (or ahamkara) and by an attraction to form. Through identification with matter and desire for sensual pleasures (kama), manas causes the incarnation of Brahman into material existence as an individual soul. Through wisdom (prajña) and discernment (vitarka), buddhi leads the incarnate soul in the opposite direction, dissolving its identification with material phenomena, causing the cessation of corresponding worldly desires (vairagya), and eventually enabling it to attain liberation (moksha).

The San Remo conference was an international meeting of the post-World War I Allied Supreme Council, held at Villa Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, from 19 to 26 April 1920. It was attended by the four Principal Allied Powers of World War I who were represented by the prime ministers of Britain (David Lloyd George), France (Alexandre Millerand) and Italy (Francesco Nitti) and by Japan's Ambassador K. Matsui.[tpl]Citation needed| date=June 2013[/tpl]
Resolutions passed at this conference determined the allocation of Class "A" League of Nations mandates for administration of the former Ottoman-ruled lands of the Middle East.
The precise boundaries of all territories were left unspecified, to "be determined by the Principal Allied Powers," and were not finalized until four years later. The conference decisions were embodied in the Treaty of Sèvres (Section VII, Art 94-97). As Turkey rejected this treaty, the conference's decisions with regard to the Palestine mandate were finally confirmed by the Council of the League of Nations on 24 July 1922.

A parallel port is a type of interface found on computers (personal and otherwise) for connecting peripherals. In computing, a parallel port is a parallel communication physical interface. It is also known as a printer port or Centronics port. It was an industry de facto standard for many years, and was finally standardized as IEEE 1284 in the late 1990s, which defined a bi-directional version of the port. Today, the parallel port interface is seeing decreasing use because of the rise of Universal Serial Bus (USB) and FireWire (IEEE 1394) devices, along with network printing using Ethernet.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
The parallel port interface was originally known as the 
Parallel Printer Adapter on IBM PC-compatible computers. It was primarily designed to operate a line printer that used IBM's 8-bit extended ASCII character set to print text, but could also be used to adapt other peripherals. Graphical printers, along with a host of other devices, have been designed to communicate with the system.

Emo [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|m|oʊ[/tpl] is a style of rock music characterized by melodic musicianship and expressive, often confessional lyrics. It originated in the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as "emotional hardcore" or "emocore" and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.
As the style was echoed by contemporary American punk rock bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with pop punk and indie rock and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate. By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts emerged from the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style.
Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and the emergence of the subgenre "screamo". In recent years the term "emo" has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multiplatinum acts and groups with disparate styles and sounds.
In addition to music, "emo" is often used more generally to signify a particular relationship between fans and artists, and to describe related aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior.

Controllability is an important property of a control system, and the controllability property plays a crucial role in many control problems, such as stabilization of unstable systems by feedback, or optimal control.
Controllability and observability are dual aspects of the same problem.
Roughly, the concept of controllability denotes the ability to move a system around in its entire configuration space using only certain admissible manipulations. The exact definition varies slightly within the framework or the type of models applied.
The following are examples of variations of controllability notions which have been introduced in the systems and control literature:

The Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg (Heidelberg University, Ruperto Carola) is a public research university located in Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386, it is the oldest university in Germany and was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire. Heidelberg has been a coeducational institution since 1899. Today the university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.The university does not include departments of business, visual arts, and engineering, except for computer engineering.

The Kingdom of Baol or Bawol in central Senegal was one of the kingdoms that arose from the split-up of the Empire of Jolof (Diolof) in 1555.  The ruler (Teigne or Teen) reigned from a capital in Diourbel.
The Kingdom encompassed a strip of land extending east from the ocean to the capital city and included the cities of Touba and MBacke.  It was directly south of the Kingdom of Cayor and north of the Kingdom of Sine. The first King of Baol is Ji the Great.
Baol was famous for its horses. It has special breeds, which were faster and stronger than most of the horses on the plain. Baol citizens are good riders.
Baol was ethnically a Wolof kingdom, but it included communities of Serer-Safen and other Serer groups.  The social and political systems were basically the same as those of Cayor.  In fact, the kingdoms merged from time to time for mutual defense.
The French conquest of Baol began in 1859.  Most of Baol was conquered by the French in 1874, however complete control of the former kingdom was not gained by France until 1895.  It was one of many campaigns of Governor Louis Faidherbe who oversaw the conquest of Cayor in 1886.

CATEGORIES: United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies established in 1868, Parliamentary constituencies in Norfolk, North Norfolk

North Norfolk is a parliamentary constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.
Formerly a safe seat for the Conservatives, it has been represented by the Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb since 2001.  This marked the first time that a Liberal aligned candidate had won a seat in Norfolk since 1929.  This was to be followed by the election of Simon Wright in Norwich South in 2010.
At the May 2005 general election the seat was one of the Conservatives' top targets as Lamb was defending a majority of just 483 against a relatively high-profile Tory, Iain Dale. However, Lamb instead increased his majority to 10,606. Although the seat had been Labour for 25 years since World War II, Labour have slumped to a distant third in recent years.
The seat often has the highest turnout of any constituency across the eastern counties in general elections at well over 70%.
North Norfolk was described by the Earl of Leicester as "the one constituency  in England where, in 1964, it was so feudal that it had to be explained to the electors that the ballot was secret."Obituary of Bert Hazell in The Independent by Tam Dalyell; 22 January 2009[tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]

The Kingdom of Waalo or Walo (formerly [tpl]lang-fr|Oualo[/tpl]) was a kingdom on the lower Senegal River in West Africa, in what are now Senegal and Mauritania. It included parts of the valley proper and areas north and south, extending to the Atlantic Ocean. To the north were Moorish emirates; to the south was the kingdom of Cayor; to the east was Jolof.
Waalo had a complicated political and social system, which has a continuing influence on Wolof culture in Senegal today, especially its highly formalized and rigid caste system. The kingdom was indirectly hereditary, ruled by three matrilinial families: the Logar, the Tedyek and the Joos, all from different ethnic backgrounds. The Joos were of Serer origin. This Serer matriclan was established in Waalo by Lingeer Ndoye Demba of Sine. Her grandmother Lingeer Fatim Beye is the matriarch and early ancestor of this dynasty. These matrilinial families engaged in constant dynastic struggles to become "Brak" or king of Waalo, as well as warring with Waalo's neighbors. The royal title "Lingeer" means queen or royal princess, used by the Serer and Wolof.
Waalo was founded in 1287. The semi-legendary figure NDiadiane Ndiaye, was from this kingdom. The mysterious figure went on to rule the kingdom of Jolof. Under NDdiadian, Jolof made Waalo a vassal.
The royal capital of Waalo was first Ndiourbel (Guribel) on the north bank of the Senegal River (in modern Mauritania), then Ndiangué on the south bank of the river, then the capital was moved to Nder on the west shore of the Lac de Guiers. Waalo was subject to constant raids for slaves not only from the Moors but also in the internecine wars.
The Brak ruled with a kind of legislature, the Seb Ak Baor, over a complicated hierarchy of officials and dignitaries. Women had high positions and figure promininently in the political and military history.
Waalo had lucrative treaties with the French, who had established their base at the island of Saint-Louis (now Saint-Louis, Senegal) near the mouth of the river. Waalo was paid fees for every boatload of gum arabic or slaves that was shipped on the river, in return for its "protection" of the trade.
Eventually this protection became ineffective. Vassals of Waalo, like Beetyo (Bethio) split off. Waalo was conquered in 1855 by the French, in a campaign of Governor Louis Faidherbe. This was the first major inland conquest by the French, by which they eventually obtained all of Mauritania, Senegal and French Sudan (now Mali). In all, Waalo had 52 kings since its founding.
Waalo had its own traditional African religion. The ruling class was slow to accept Islam, which had spread in the valley; the Brak converted only in the 19th century. Waalo fell to France in 1855.

Marcus Claudius Marcellus (ca. 268–208 BC), five times elected as consul of the Roman Republic, was an important Roman military leader during the Gallic War of 225 BC and the Second Punic War. Marcellus gained the most prestigious award a Roman general could earn, the spolia opima, for killing the Gallic military leader and king Viridomarus in hand-to-hand combat in 222 BC at the battle of Clastidium. Furthermore, he is noted for having conquered the fortified city of Syracuse in a protracted siege during which Archimedes, the famous inventor, was killed. Marcus Claudius Marcellus died in battle in 208 BC, leaving behind a legacy of military conquests and a reinvigorated Roman legend of the spolia opima.

[[Layene]]
CATEGORIES: Lebou people, Religion in Senegal, French West Africa, Sufi orders, Sufism in Africa

The Layene Brotherhood is a religious sect of Sufi Islam based in Senegal and founded by Seydina Limamou Laye. It is notable for its unorthodox Muslim eschatology and belief in prophetic reincarnation, and for combining elements of Christianity and Islam.
The Layene are a missionary sect open to all members, but consisting mostly of the Lebou ethnicity who live in fishing communities on the Cap-Vert or Cape Verde peninsula north of Dakar, Senegal.  The Layene brotherhood is the fourth largest of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal. Their spiritual leader is known as the Khalif, who also has broad authority over temporal matters in the Layene quarter of the town of Yoff, Senegal. Yoff is home to the Khalif, an elaborate mosque, the mausoleum of its founder, and several of his descendents. There is also a notable Layene mosque in Cambérèrene, Senegal.
Despite its name of "brotherhood confrérie," the Layene Brotherhood includes women. Top leadership is restricted to the male descendents of the founder, Seydina Limamou Laye.
The Layene Brotherhood was founded in 1884 by an uneducated Lebou fisherman who adopted the name Seydina Limamou Laye. He claimed to be the Mahdi, an Islamic messianic figure, and also the reincarnation of the prophet Muhammad. He claimed his son, Seydina Issa Rouhou Laye, was the second coming of Jesus.Sylla, Assane. Not dated 1987. Les Prophetes: Seydina Limamou le Mahdi et Seydina Issa Rouhou Lahi.

2. Seydina Mangione Laye, 1949-1971
3. Seydina Issa Laye II, 1971-1987
4. Mame Alassane Laye, 1987-2001
5. Cherif Abdoulaye Thiaw, 2001–present
Layene beliefs and practices include the normal five pillars of Islam, with some additional obligations imposed by Seydina Limamou Laye. For instance, prior to each of the five daily prayers, they wash not only their hands, but their forearms as well. In celebration of Jesus as one of their founding figures, they use the cross as one of their symbols, celebrate Christmas on December 25, and read from the Bible as well as the Quran. They hold a weekly ceremony called the chants religieuse that begins shortly before midnight on Saturday and continues until the dawn prayer on Sunday. The chants religieuse consist of energetic sermons, singing, and an Africanized version of the collective dancing that is a recurring feature of Sufism.
Most Layenes live in the Cap-Vert area around Dakar, but there is a Layene presence in most other areas of Senegal, and a few live in Italy, France, and the United States. In 1812 the political independence of the Lebou from the Kingdom of Cayor was recognized.  Today the Layene are granted special autonomy in the constitution, laws and practices of Senegal. The present Khalif of the Layene (in 2002) is Cherif Abdoulaye Thiaw, the grandson of Seydina Limamou Laye.

[[New Jersey Route 31]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Transportation in Mercer County, New Jersey, Transportation in Warren County, New Jersey

Route 31 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs [tpl]convert|48.93|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Bus.)/US 206 in Trenton, Mercer County north to an intersection with US 46 in Buttzville in White Township, Warren County. Along the way, Route 31 heads through the communities of Flemington, Clinton and Washington. Most of the highway is state-maintained; however, the section within the city limits of Trenton is maintained by the city. Much of Route 31 is a two-lane highway that passes through farmland, woodland, and mountainous areas. Two portions of the route—from Trenton to Pennington and from Ringoes to Clinton—consist of more development.
The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. Route 31 has carried two different numbers in the past. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with US 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69. There were plans made in the late 1960s and early 1970s to build a freeway in the Route 31 corridor that would begin in the Trenton area and extend as far north as Interstate 84 (I-84) in Port Jervis, New York; however, it was canceled in the mid-1970s due to opposition from area residents and environmental and financial constraints. In recent years, the portion of Route 31 between Flemington and Clinton has been widened to four lanes. In addition, there was a failed project to build a bypass of Flemington that would have also eliminated the Flemington Circle.

A chocolate bar is a confection in bar form comprising some or all of the following components: cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar, and milk. The relative presence or absence of these components form the subclasses of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate. In addition to these main ingredients, it may contain emulsifiers such as soy lecithin and flavors such as vanilla.
In most of the English-speaking world, chocolate bar also refers to what is typically called a candy bar in American English. This is a form of confectionery usually packaged in a bar or log form, often coated with chocolate and sized as a snack for one person. But within that term, a wide variety of products exist, ranging from solid chocolate bars to multiple layerings or mixtures of ingredients such as nuts, fruit, caramel, or fondant containing no chocolate.
Certain brands of chocolate bars and candy bars are sold as being for nutritional supplementation purposes. These bars contain protein and various vitamins while still retaining a sweet taste.

The banns of marriage, commonly known simply as the "banns" or "bans" (from a Middle English word meaning "proclamation," rooted in Frankish and from there to Old FrenchAMHER, banns, also bans: (Middle English banes, pl. of ban, proclamation, from Old French ban (of Germanic origin).), are the public announcement in a Christian parish church of an impending marriage between two specified persons.  It is commonly associated with the Church of England and with other denominations whose traditions are similar; the Roman Catholic Church abolished the requirement in 1983.
The purpose of banns is to enable anyone to raise any canonical or civil legal impediment to the marriage, so as to prevent marriages that are invalid. Impediments vary between legal jurisdictions, but would normally include a pre-existing marriage that has been neither dissolved nor annulled, a vow of celibacy, lack of consent, or the couple's being related within the prohibited degrees of kinship.

The route is signed east–west between Eatontown and Long Branch and north–south between Long Branch and Keyport.
Route 36 was created in 1927 to run from Keyport to Highlands along a winding route that went through the downtowns of Keyport, Keansburg, and Atlantic Highlands. In 1929, the route was modified to bypass the downtown areas. Route 36 was extended to Eatontown in 1940 with only the portion within Eatontown and West Long Branch built. The remainder of the route was created with the takeover of Joline Avenue in Long Branch and Ocean Avenue in Monmouth Beach and Sea Bright from Monmouth County on October 17, 1972 and the completion of Ocean Boulevard in Long Branch in late 1983.

Mathis and J. Stanley Tunney Bridges.  The route through Toms River Township is lined with many businesses and named Little League World Champions Boulevard in honor of Toms River East Little League's victory in the 1998 Little League World Series. Route 37 intersects many major roads in the Toms River area, including County Route 527, the Garden State Parkway/U.S. Route 9, Route 166, County Route 549, and County Route 571. The route experiences congestion from both development in the area and from traffic bound for the barrier islands in the summer. 
Route 37 was first legislated in 1927 in two sections: one running from Trenton to White Horse along the current U.S. Route 206 alignment that replaced part of Pre-1927 Route 2 and the other running from Lakehurst to Point Pleasant that replaced part of Pre-1927 Route 18 between Lakehurst and Toms River. In 1953, Route 37 was legislated along its current alignment, with the designation dropped on the Trenton–White Horse segment to avoid the concurrency with U.S. Route 206 and the Seaside Heights–Point Pleasant section becoming a realignment of Route 35.  Route 37 was then proposed in the 1960s as a freeway running from White Horse to Seaside Heights. This freeway proposal was eventually altered to create Interstate 195, running from Trenton to Wall Township.

Similarly, Quebec City is common (e.g., per the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (ISBN 0-19-541816-6, p. 1265)), and is used particularly to distinguish the city from the province.

The narrowing of the Saint Lawrence River proximate to the city's promontory, Cap-Diamant (Cape Diamond), and Lévis, on the opposite bank, provided the name given to the city, Kébec, an Algonquin word meaning "where the river narrows". Founded in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain, Quebec City is one of the oldest cities in North America.

A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. Winnipeg is the seventh-largest municipality in Canada, and is the primary municipality of the Winnipeg Capital Region.
The economy of Winnipeg is primarily based on the finance, manufacturing, food and beverage production, culture, retail and tourism sectors. Winnipeg is a transportation hub, served by Richardson International Airport.  The city has railway connections to the United States and Eastern and Western Canada. Winnipeg's professional sports teams are the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (football), the Winnipeg Jets (hockey), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball). Its post-secondary institutions are Red River College, the University of Manitoba, the University of Winnipeg, Canadian Mennonite University, Booth University College,  and University of St. Boniface (formerly known as St. Boniface College). Some of the city's popular festivals include the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Winnipeg Jazz Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama.

[[Kahone]]
CATEGORIES: Populated places in Senegal, Kaolack Region

 
Kahone is a town and commune near Kaolack, Senegal.  It is primarily agricultural, but it is participating in industrial development plans.  Also, the town is pursuing increased tourism based on its ancient Serer culture.
Kahone is the royal seat of the Serer Kingdom of Saloum which has ruled there since the 15th century after the Battle of Turubang (1335) and centuries previous to that. Kahone was originally a far more important town than Kaolack, but the roles have been reversed in recent years, and Kahone has been reduced to a sub-prefecture of Kaolack.  An annual royal festival is celebrated in which the OMaad (Serer king), Djaraaf (Serer prime minister) and other dignitaries meet to decide kingdom issues and hold pageants celebrating the history of Saloum and the Serer people.
There is a mosque thanks to the Wolof and Fula Muslim settlers and a Catholic mission in Kahone.  There are numerous ancient tombs, stone circles and megaliths in the vicinity as well as large burial mounds implanted with baobab trees.
Kahone is routinely involved in many administrative territorial disputes with neighboring communes, always emphasizing its earlier importance.

Guaraní are a group of culturally related indigenous peoples of South America. They are distinguished from the related Tupi by their use of the Guaraní language. The traditional range of the Guaraní people is in what is now Paraguay between the Uruguay River and lower Paraguay River, the Misiones Province of Argentina, southern Brazil, and parts of Uruguay and Bolivia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7843|title=Society-GUARANI[/tpl]  Although their demographic dominance of the region has been reduced by European colonisation and the commensurate rise of mestizos, there are contemporary Guaraní populations in these areas. Most notably, the Guarani language, still widely spoken across traditional Guaraní homelands, is one of the two official languages in Paraguay, the other one being Spanish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.embaparusa.gov.py/paraguay.html |title=Paraguay |publisher=Embassy of Paraguay in the United States of America[/tpl] The language was once looked down upon by the upper and middle classes, but it is now often regarded with pride and serves as a symbol of national distinctiveness.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] The Paraguayan population learns Guaraní both informally from social interaction and formally in public schools. In modern Spanish Guaraní is also applied to refer to any Paraguayan national in the same way that the French are sometimes called Gauls.

[[Plonk (Usenet)]]
CATEGORIES: Internet slang, Usenet

Plonk is a Usenet jargon term for adding a particular poster to one's kill file such that the poster's future postings are completely ignored. It was first used in 1989, and by 1994http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/P/plonk.html was a commonly used term on Usenet regarding kill file additions.
The word is an example of onomatopoeia, intended to humorously represent the supposed sound[tpl]cite web | title=The first *plonk*| url=http://rs79.vrx.net/works/usenet/terms/plonk/ | publisher=Richard Sexton, VRx | date=25 February 2008 | accessdate=2008-02-25[/tpl] of the user hitting the bottom of the kill file (imagining perhaps the kill file as a bucket). It is also sometimes given as an acronym standing for Please Log Off, Net Kook, though this is likely a backronym. Other used expressions are "put lamer on killfile"http://groups.google.com/groups?q=put+lamer+on+killfile  and Please Leave Our Newsgroup: Killfile!
It is also used as a verb: "I plonked that idiot".  As a public repudiation of the plonked poster, it is appended to the end of one's reply (or may constitute the entire reply).  A user might also simply reply to the impugned post with the word "Plonk".
The term's usage later expanded to include the use of e-mail filters that delete incoming messages that meet certain filter criteria set by the receiving user, so block messages from annoying senders. It has also often been figuratively used on BBSes, webboards, blogs, IRC, and wikis (which usually do not actually have filters), and is occasionally used in reference to blocking a user on an IM protocol.

Jethro Tull (1674 – 21 February 1741) was an English agricultural pioneer from Berkshire who helped bring about the British Agricultural Revolution. He perfected a horse-drawn seed drill in 1701 that economically sowed the seeds in neat rows, and later a horse-drawn hoe. Tull's methods were adopted by many large landowners, and they helped form the basis of modern agriculture. 
The progressive rock band Jethro Tull was named after him.[tpl]cite web|title=FAQ on official Jethro Tull web site|url=http://jethrotull.com/press/|accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl]

The event grew from gay rights marches held annually since 1978, when numerous participants had been contentiously arrested by New South Wales State Police.

Reflecting changes since the first Sydney Mardi Gras, participants in the Mardi Gras Parade now include groups of uniformed Australian Defence Force personnel, Police officers from New South Wales State Police, as well as interstate/federal police officers, firefighters and other emergency services personnel from the Australian LGBTI community.

They are the languages spoken by the Serer people who do not speak the Serer language (Serer-Sine).

However, they are not closely related; Serer is closer to Fulani than it is to Cangin.

[[Shorthand]]

CATEGORIES: Shorthand systems, Stenographers, Transcription (linguistics)

Shorthand is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases speed and brevity of writing as compared to a normal method of writing a language. The process of writing in shorthand is called stenography, from the Greek stenos (narrow) and graphē or graphie (writing). It has also been called brachygraphy, from Greek brachys (short) and tachygraphy, from Greek tachys (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of writing is the goal.
Many forms of shorthand exist. A typical shorthand system provides symbols or abbreviations for words and common phrases, which can allow someone well-trained in the system to write as quickly as people speak. Abbreviation methods are alphabet-based and use different abbreviating approaches. Several autocomplete programs, standalone or integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a shorthand function for frequently-used phrases. Many journalists use shorthand writing to quickly take notes at press conferences or other similar scenarios.
Shorthand was used more widely in the past, before the invention of recording and dictation machines. Shorthand was considered an essential part of secretarial training as well as being useful for journalists. Although the primary use of shorthand has been to record oral dictation or discourse, some systems are used for compact expression. For example, health-care professionals may use shorthand notes in medical charts and correspondence. Shorthand notes are typically temporary, intended either for immediate use or for later transcription to longhand, although longer term uses do exist, diaries (like that of the famous Samuel Pepys) being a common example.[tpl]citation |last1=Pepys |first1=Samuel |year=1970 |title=The diary of Samuel Pepys: a new and complete transcription |first2=Robert |last2=Latham |first3=William |last3=Matthews |publisher=Bell & Hyman |isbn=978-0-7135-1551-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JS9bAAAAMAAJ[/tpl], Volume I, pp. xlvii–liv (for Thomas Shelton's shorthand system and Pepys' use of it)

[[Variable bitrate]]

CATEGORIES: Codecs, Data transmission

Variable bitrate (VBR) is a term used in telecommunications and computing that relates to the bitrate used in sound or video encoding.  As opposed to constant bitrate (CBR), VBR files vary the amount of output data per time segment.  VBR allows a higher bitrate (and therefore requires more storage space) to be allocated to the more complex segments of media files while less space is allocated to less complex segments.  The average of these rates can be calculated to produce an average bitrate for the file.
MP3, Opus, WMA, Vorbis, and AAC audio files can optionally be encoded in VBR.[ref]

The manuscript became known to Western scholars as a result of correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library. Portions of the codex were collated by several scholars, but numerous errors were made during this process. The Codex's relationship to the Latin Vulgate was unclear and scholars were initially unaware of the Codex's value. This changed in the 19th century when transcriptions of the full codex were completed. It was at that point that scholars realised the text differed significantly from the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus.
Current scholarship considers the Codex Vaticanus to be one of the best Greek texts of the New Testament, with the Codex Sinaiticus as its only competitor. Until the discovery by Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the Codex was unrivaled.[tpl]cite book | last = Scrivener | first = Frederick Henry Ambrose | authorlink = Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener | coauthors = | title = Six Lectures on the Text of the New Testament and the Ancient Manuscripts | publisher = | year = 1875 | location = Cambridge | page = 26 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=vrIqgFRZx7wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=pl#PPA26,M1 | doi =  | isbn = [/tpl] It was extensively used by Westcott and Hort in their edition of The New Testament in the Original Greek in 1881.

Philip Edward "Phil" Hartman (September 24, 1948[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]May 28, 1998; born Hartmann) was a Canadian American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and graphic artist. Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family moved to the United States when he was 10. After graduating from California State University, Northridge, with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands like Poco and America. Feeling the need for a more creative outlet, Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show Pee-wee's Playhouse.
Hartman became famous in the late 1980s when he joined the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. He won fame for his impressions, particularly of President Bill Clinton, and he stayed on the show for eight seasons. Given the moniker, "The Glue", for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members, Hartman won a Primetime Emmy Award for his SNL work in 1989. In 1995, after scrapping plans for his own variety show, he starred as Bill McNeal in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio. He had frequent roles on The Simpsons as Lionel Hutz, Troy McClure, and others, and appeared in the films Houseguest, Sgt. Bilko, Jingle All the Way, and Small Soldiers.
Hartman had been divorced twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987; the couple had two children together. However, their marriage was fractured, due in part to Brynn's drug use. On May 28, 1998, Brynn shot and killed Hartman while he slept in their Encino, Los Angeles, home, then committed suicide several hours later. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper...a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with". Hartman was posthumously inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2012.

A constant companion of Kama, she is often depicted with him in legend and temple sculpture. She also enjoys worship along with Kama. Rati is often associated with the arousal and delight of sexual activity, and many sex techniques and positions derive their Sanskrit names from hers.
The Hindu scriptures stress her beauty and sensuality. They depict her as a maiden who has the power to enchant the god of love. When the god Shiva burnt her husband to ashes, it was Rati, whose beseeching or penance, leads to the promise of Kama's resurrection. Often, this resurrection occurs when Kama is reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna. Separated from his parents at birth, Rati – under the name of Mayavati – plays a critical role in the upbringing of Pradyumna. She acts as his nanny, as well as his lover, and tells him the way to return to his parents by slaying the demon-king, who is destined to die at his hands. Later, Kama-Pradyumna accepts Rati-Mayavati as his wife.

[[Historical cost]]

CATEGORIES: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Costs, Accounting terminology

In accounting, historical costs is the original monetary value of an economic item.IFRS - Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, paragraph 100, IASC Historical cost is based on the stable measuring unit assumption. In some circumstances, assets and liabilities may be shown at their historical cost, as if there had been no change in value since the date of acquisition. The balance sheet value of the item may therefore differ from the "true" value.
While historical cost is criticised for its inaccuracy (deviation from "true" value), it remains in use in most accounting systems. Various corrections to historical cost are used, many of which require the use of management judgment and may be difficult to implement or verify. The trend in most accounting standards is a move to more accurate reflection of the fair or market value, although the historical cost principle remains in use, particularly for assets of little importance.
Depreciation affects the carrying value of an asset on the balance sheet. The historical cost will equal the carrying value if there has been no change recorded in the value of the asset since acquisition. Improvements may be added to the cost basis of an asset.
Historical cost does not generally reflect current market valuation. Alternative measurement bases to the historical cost measurement basis, which may be applied for some types of assets for which market values are readily available, require that the carrying value of an asset (or liability) be updated to the market price (mark-to-market valuation) or some other estimate of value that better approximates the real value. Accounting standards may also have different methods required or allowed (even for different types of balance sheet variable real value non-monetary assets or liabilities) as to how the resultant change in value of an asset or liability is recorded, as a part of income or as a direct change to shareholders' equity.
The Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power model is an International Accounting Standards Board approved alternative basic accounting model to the traditional Historical Cost Accounting model.

The Blues Brothers first appeared on Saturday Night Live on January 17, 1976.[tpl]cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75j.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Buck Henry: 01/17/76 |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=1976-01-17 |accessdate=2013-04-24[/tpl] The band made its second appearance as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978 episode of Saturday Night Live. They would make their third and last appearance on November 18, 1978.[tpl]cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78f.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Carrie Fisher: 11/18/78 |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=1978-11-18 |accessdate=2013-04-24[/tpl]
The band began to take on a life beyond the confines of television, releasing an album, Briefcase Full of Blues, in 1978, and then having a Hollywood film, The Blues Brothers, created around its characters in 1980.
After the death of Belushi in 1982, the Blues Brothers have continued to perform with a rotation of guest singers and other band members. The band reformed in 1988 for a world tour and again in 1998 for a sequel film, Blues Brothers 2000. They make regular appearances at musical festivals worldwide.
On August 31, 2011, it was announced that Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi's widow Judith Belushi Pisano were pitching a new Blues Brothers TV series to primetime networks.[tpl]cite web|last=Levine |first=Stuart |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118042012 |title='Blues Brothers' readies for primetime |work=Variety |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2012-05-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blues-brothers-team-up-panacea-entertainment-309231 |title=Blues Brothers and Panacea Entertainment Have Big Plans |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=2012-05-15[/tpl]

Michael Andreas Helmuth Ende (12 November 1929 – 28 August 1995) was a German writer of fantasy and children's fiction. He is best known for his epic fantasy The Neverending Story; other famous works include Momo and Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer (Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver). His works have been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 20 million copies, and adapted as motion pictures, stage plays, operas and audio books.
Ende was one of the most popular and famous German authors of the 20th century, mostly due to the enormous success of his children's fiction. He was not strictly a children's writer, however, as he wrote books for adults too. Ende claimed, "It is for this child in me, and in all of us, that I tell my stories", and that "books are for any child between 80 and 8 years" (qtd. Senick 95, 97). He often expressed frustration over being perceived as a children's writer exclusively, considering that his purpose was to speak of cultural problems and spiritual wisdom to people of all ages. He wrote in 1985:
 One may enter the literary parlor via just about any door, be it the prison door, the madhouse door, or the brothel door. There is but one door one may not enter it through, which is the nursery door. The critics will never forgive you such. The great Rudyard Kipling is one to have suffered this. I keep wondering to myself what this peculiar contempt towards anything related to childhood is all about."Man darf von jeder Tür aus in den literarischen Salon treten, aus der Gefängnistür, aus der Irrenhaustür oder aus der Bordelltür. Nur aus einer Tür darf man nicht kommen, aus der Kinderzimmertür. Das vergibt einem die Kritik nicht. Das bekam schon der große Rudyard Kipling zu spüren. Ich frage mich immer, womit das eigentlich zu tun hat, woher diese eigentümliche Verachtung alles dessen herrührt, was mit dem Kind zu tun hat.[tpl]-"[/tpl] Page on Michael Ende by Thienemann, the publishing house that published most of Ende's works. 
Ende's writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and fantasy. The reader is often invited to take a more interactive role in the story, and the worlds in his books often mirror our reality, using fantasy to bring light to the problems of an increasingly technological modern society. His writings were influenced by anthroposophy.Peter Boccarius, Michael Ende: Der Anfang der Geschichte, München: Nymphenburger, 1990. ISBN 3-485-00622-X. German.Michael Ende biographical notes, "Michael Ende und die magischen Weltbilder" (German). "...es sei nicht nur die Steinersche Anthroposophie gewesen, die Michael Endes Weltsicht geprägt habe." ("...it was not only Steiner's anthroposophy that defined Michael Ende's world view.") Accessed 2008-09-08 Ende was also known as a proponent of economic reform, and claimed to have had the concept of aging money, or demurrage, in mind when writing Momo.

[[Carnival of Champions]]

CATEGORIES: Boxing fights, 1982 in boxing, Boxing in Louisiana, Sports in New Orleans, Louisiana, 1982 in Louisiana, HBO Sports

The Carnival of Champions, as Don King nicknamed it, was an important boxing event held in New Orleans's Louisiana Superdome on December 3, 1982.
The event had caught the international attention of boxing fans worldwide, but particularly in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico, because the two main events that night featured two Puerto Ricans, one Mexican and one American.
In the undercard's first of two co-main events, Wilfredo Gómez of Puerto Rico would defend his WBC world Jr Featherweight championship against WBC's world Bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor of Mexico. In the second, Wilfred Benítez, also of Puerto Rico, would defend his WBC world Jr Middleweight championship against the former WBA Welterweight champion of the world Thomas Hearns, of Detroit, Michigan.
There was a lot of media hype surrounding the event, and HBO televised both. Gómez, Pintor, Hearns and HBO commentator Sugar Ray Leonard (who came in to substitute Benitez) were paraded around New Orleans a few days before the event, and many former and current world boxing champions and celebrities attended the fights.
In Puerto Rico in particular, the event had been eagerly awaited for, because it would be the first time the two Wilfredos would fight the same night and in the same ring, defending their world titles. Another Wilfredo who would later join Gómez and Benitez as three division world champions, Wilfredo Vazquez, had been announced as a participator in the undercard, but he had to pull out because of an injury days prior to the fight.
After an excellent undercard that included a win by Alberto Mercado, Pintor was the first of the four world champions to step into the ring that night, to challenge Gómez for Gómez's world title. In a brutal slugfest, Gómez struck first, hitting Pintor with an uppercut in round one, and pinning Pintor against the ropes for a good portion of round two, including a nineteen punch combination that had Pintor almost falling. It wasn't to be easy, however, and by the third round, Pintor began to introduce his jab to Gómez's face. Gómez's eye began to puff almost immediately. Gómez showed his championship heart by roaring back to take the fourth despite the bothering hematoma forming over his eye. 
In the fifth, it was Pintor's turn to come back and take a round, but Gómez pounded Pintor to the head in rounds six, seven and eight, the latter in which Pintor lost a point for punching low. Pintor was finding out that Gómez was as hard to beat as his 37-1-1 (37 knockouts) record said he was. Pintor, however, had the heart of a lion too, and in the ninth he punched Gómez with poison in his hands and bad intentions, taking that round and round ten. Then came round eleven, one of the fiercest rounds in the Jr Featherweight boxing's history. Gómez and Pintor traded punches toe to toe fiercely during that round, and both men had to be carried by their cornermen back to their corners. However, Gómez's eyes were both almost closed by now, and his fans started having flashbacks of his 1981 bout with world featherweight champion Salvador Sánchez. Gómez realized he needed a dramatic finish, and in the twelfth he hit Pintor with everything he had, and with Pintor tiring and on the catching end of most of that round's punches, he figured out he had to try to outbox Gómez the rest of the way.
In round thirteen, Pintor attacked Gómez's eyes from a distance with his jab. One of the least action packed rounds was still a very good round, and Pintor took it by outmaneuvering Gómez for the first time in the bout.
Gómez, imagining he could have been behind on the scorecards, came for the fourteenth in a roar, and started throwing punches from all angles. Pintor was tired and Gómez looked stronger, but Gómez's eyes were almost completely closed by this time, and he could barely see Pintor. He was, as he described it later himself Fighting on instinct only. Then, suddenly he caught Pintor with a right to the temple and Pintor fell on his knees, for the first knockdown of the fight. He bravely beat the count of referee Arthur Mercante, but Gómez didn't waste his opportunity and chased his wounded prey with uppercuts and crosses, until a right cross caught Pintor on his chin and he fell to the floor on his back. Mercante didn't bother to count this time: He stopped the fight immediately and Gómez had retained his world title in a dramatic fight.
According to KO Magazine, Gómez led on fight judge Harold Lederman's card by 125-121, and on Dick Cole's by 126-120, while Pintor led on Artie Aidala's card by 124-121 at the time of the stoppage. KO Magazine's staff writer had it for Gómez at 125-120.  
20 minutes after the first of the two co main events was over, it was Hearns' turn to step into the ring and challenge Benitez. The two engaged in one of the most intense staredowns in history. After touching gloves, Hearns began to use his longer jab, but the brave champion started to dig in. Hearns boxed from a distance in rounds one, two and three and Benitez kept applying pressure, and using his best method of fighting: Lying against the ropes. Whenever pinned there, Hearns would try to unleash a combination and Benitez would slip the punches coming at him and countering. Benitez's championship heart was also a very huge one.
In the fifth, Hearns struck with a right to the head and Benitez's gloves touched the canvas. Referee Octavio Meyran of Mexico counted, but Benitez came back and almost won the round after that. Hearns also dominated the sixth and the seventh, but in the eighth, a Benitez right hand graced Hearns' chin and Hearns fell on all fours. Hearns also got up, and won the ninth round. Rounds ten and eleven were all Wilfredo, with the champion trying to close the gap between him and Hearns with masterful counter punching and ring intelligence. Hearns, however, knew he needed the next few rounds to secure another world title, and he outboxed Benitez in round twelve using his jab. Benitez also imagined he was the one who needed a rally, and had in rounds thirteen and fourteen, two of his best rounds of the fight. In round fifteen, Hearns seemed to think he had the decision secured, and Benitez seemed to imagine he needed a knockout to win, so Hearns proceeded to use his jab for three more minutes and Benitez tried to avoid defeat by throwing quick combinations onto Hearns' face to see if he could find the punch that would finally lay down The Hitman for good. But it wasn't to be, and the bell rang, putting an end to the second of two intense and historic boxing battles. 
When the decision was announced, it was a majority decision: two judges had voted for Hearns, (144-139 and 146-136, according to KO magazine) and one for a draw (142-142), making Hearns the WBC's new world Jr Middleweight champion. Sadly, the hours prior to the fight would turn out to be Benitez's last hours as a current world boxing champion.
The two Wilfredos of Puerto Rico had gone 1-1 that night, but their show of bravery and championship heart didn't leave many boxing fans disappointed.

[[Royal charter]]
CATEGORIES: British monarchy, Monarchy in Canada, Monarchy in Australia, Monarchy in New Zealand, Political charters, Medieval charters and cartularies

A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters.Chartered bodies | Privy Council. Privycouncil.independent.gov.uk. Retrieved 2 May 2012. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity which received its charter on 7 April 2011.
Charters have been used in Europe since medieval times to create cities (that is, localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter is granted is considered to be when a city is 'founded', regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled (which is often impossible to determine).
At one time, a royal charter was the sole means by which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally used nowadays instead.
Among the past and present groups formed by royal charter are the British East India Company (1600), the Hudson's Bay Company, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), the British South Africa Company, and some of the former British colonies on the North American mainland, City livery companies, the Bank of England and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).BBC Trust | Charter and Agreement.

Sir Roger Gilbert Bannister, CBE (born 23 March 1929) is an English former athlete, doctor and academic, who ran the first  sub-four-minute mile.
In the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Bannister set a British record in the 1500 metres, but did not win the medal he expected. This humiliation strengthened his resolve to be the first 4-minute miler.
This was finally achieved on 6 May 1954 at Iffley Road Track in Oxford, with Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher providing the pacing. When the announcer declared "The time was three...", the cheers of the crowd drowned-out the details of the result, which was 3 min 59.4 sec.
Bannister's record only lasted 46 days. More notable was that he had reached this record with so little training, while practising as a junior doctor.
Bannister went on to become a distinguished neurologist and Master of Pembroke College at the University of Oxford, before retiring in 1993. When asked whether the 4-minute mile was his proudest achievement, he said he felt prouder of his contribution to academic medicine through research into the responses of the nervous system. Bannister is patron of The MSA Trust. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011.Roger Bannister reveals Parkinson's

[[Bald Rock National Park]]

CATEGORIES: National parks of New South Wales, Protected areas established in 1971, 1971 establishments in Australia

Bald Rock National Park is a national park in northern New South Wales, Australia, just north of Tenterfield on the Queensland border.  The border passes over the rock on the Western side. On the other side of the border national park continues as the Girraween National Park. 
The park is named after its most prominent feature, Bald Rock, which is a large granite outcrop rising about 200 metres above the surrounding landscape. Measuring about 750 metres long and 500 metres wide this is the largest granite monolith in Australia.Readers Digest Guide to Australian Places, Readers Digest, Sydney Access to the rock is provided by a sealed road into the park and walking tracks to the summit.  Two tracks are marked, a steep one up the exposed face, or an easier gradient through bushland around the back. The Bungoona Walking Track, built in 1980, goes more gently up the eastern side of Bald Rock and winds through forest. It passes through some beautiful granite boulder formations, including an arch, covered in mosses, ferns and orchids.  The summit offers panoramic views of the surrounding bushland, but vegetation on top prevents a full 360° view. 
The park is in the New England granite belt, where about 220 million years ago an episode of granite magmatism resulted in the intrusion of the Stanthorpe Adamellite into the surrounding metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  Subsequent uplift and erosion of the New England Fold Belt has seen the majority of the surrounding sediments and metamorphic rocks eroded away, with the Stanthorpe Adamellite remaining due to its resistance to weathering.
This regolith has created a landscape with many exposed inselbergs of granite rocks, some balancing on top of each other, or forming natural arches.  
Just off the main road from Tenterfield to the park is Thunderbolts Hideout, a set of caves and overhanging granite rocks.  It was thought to have been used by bushranger Captain Thunderbolt. A little further along the same road are some historic World War II tank traps.

The Park contains one of the last temperate rainforests on the Central Coast, Fletchers Glen.
Bouddi National Park was originally known as Bouddi Natural Park. It received its name at the second meeting of the park trust held on 5 July 1936. Other names considered were Maitland Bay Park, Cape Three Points Reserve and Gerrinbombi Park. The reason for the choice was that Bouddi is the authenticated aboriginal name of the most conspicuous feature of the district and appears on maps as early as 1828. Bouddi is the Aboriginal word for the heart.Bennett p17 The trust had been founded the year earlier to manage the reserve and had representation from the NSW Federation of Bushwalking Clubs and Erina Shire Council.
In 1967, the park (by then totalling about 1310 acres) was dedicated as a national park under the newly passed legislation and was renamed Bouddi State Park. Its management became the responsibility of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, and soon afterwards the trust was reconstituted as an advisory committee. On 1 January 1974, the National Parks and Wildlife Act dispensed with the category of State parks and Bouddi was renamed Bouddi National Park.Pratt p4

The Commendation Medal is a mid-level United States military decoration which is presented for sustained acts of heroism or meritorious service. For valorous actions in direct contact with an enemy, but of a lesser degree than required for the award of the Bronze Star Medal, a Commendation Medal with  "V" Device or Combat "V" (Navy/Marine) is awarded; the "V" device may be authorized for wear on the service and suspension ribbon of the medal to denote valor. Each branch of the United States Armed Forces issues its own version of the Commendation Medal, with a fifth version existing for acts of joint military service performed under the Department of Defense.
The Commendation Medal was originally only a service ribbon and was first awarded by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard in 1943. An Army Commendation Ribbon followed in 1945, and in 1949, the Navy, Coast Guard, and Army Commendation ribbons were renamed the "Commendation Ribbon with Medal Pendant."  By 1960, the Commendation Ribbons had been authorized as full medals and were subsequently referred to as Commendation Medals.
Additional awards of the Army and Air Force Commendation Medals are denoted by bronze and silver oak leaf clusters. The Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and Coast Guard Commendation Medal are authorized gold and silver 5/16 inch stars to denote additional awards. The Operational Distinguishing Device is authorized for wear on the Coast Guard Commendation Medal upon approval of the awarding authority. Order of Precedence is following the Bronze Star Medal but before the Prisoner of War Medal and all campaign medals. Each of the military services also awards separate Achievement Medals which are below the Commendation Medals in precedence.

[[Lane Cove National Park]]

CATEGORIES: National parks of New South Wales, Protected areas established in 1992, 1992 establishments in Australia

Lane Cove National Park is a national park within metropolitan Sydney, Australia.  It is about ten kilometres north-west of the Sydney CBD.  The park consists of land near the banks of the Lane Cove River,  which flows generally south-east into Sydney Harbour. It also extends to the outskirts of Pennant Hills and Wahroonga. 
The park includes areas of land which are part of Ku-ring-gai, Ryde, and Hornsby local government areas with small areas of the park in Willoughby, Lane Cove and Hunter's Hill local government areas on the banks of the lower reaches of the river.   The park is surrounded on all sides by developed suburban areas and except for the upper northwestern region is never more than a kilometre wide.  Much of the park is of fairly rugged terrain on the slopes of the river valley and covered by dense bush.  The characteristics of the bush vary depending upon soils and topography. Parts of the park are affected by weed infestations.
The central section of the park,  between De Burghs Bridge on Ryde Road and Fullers Bridge, was set aside as a park in the 1920s and developed with picnic areas interspersed in the bush along the banks of the river. 
The majority of these picnic areas are located between the Fuller's Road bridge and the road that leads towards the Tourist Park. 
North of this point the area becomes more rugged and there are no picnic areas until the Tunks Hill (previously known as Tunks Farm) area which is away from the river behind the garden nursery on Lane Cove Road.
A weir was constructed in the 1930snear Fullers Bridge which converted the middle section of the river from tidal salt-water to a fresh-water area with constant water level suitable for recreational use in rowing boats and canoes.  This area was managed by a trust and was called Lane Cove River Park.  In 1982,  the NSW Government took over direct control of the park which was then called Lane Cove Regional Park. Various nearby areas of undeveloped government land near the river upstream and downstream from the central area including an area around Pennant Hills Park has also been added to the National Park. It was then renamed Lane Cove National Park in 1992.
A fish ladder has been constructed next to the weir to enable Australian bass to access the freshwater breeding grounds upstream of the weir. Fishing is allowed in parts of the Lane Cove River as per restrictions managed by NSW Department of Primary Industries.Sydney Harbour and Northern beaches recreational fishing guide
The Lane Cove National Park is very popular with walkers, joggers and cyclists as the road through the park (Riverside Drive) is generally only lightly used by vehicles and the only alternative road, Delhi Road is a steep narrow road with high speed traffic.
The Lane Cove River Tourist Park, operated by National Parks of NSW, is located within Lane Cove National Park.
The walking track along the bank of Lane Cove River forms part of The Great North Walk from Sydney CBD to Newcastle. 
A rare mushroom Hygrocybe aurantipes was discovered in Lane Cove National Park in 1990.

The roads to, in or around the park may become impassable during or after rain.
The central feature of Mungo National Park is Lake Mungo, the second largest of the ancient dry lakes. Mungo National Park is most significant for the archaeological remains which have been discovered there. The remains of Mungo Man, the oldest human remains discovered in Australia, and Mungo Lady, the oldest known human to have been ritually cremated, were both discovered within the park. They were buried on the shore of Lake Mungo, beneath the 'Walls of China', a series of lunettes on the South eastern edge of the lake.
A visitor centre, where further information and a map may be acquired, is located near the old Mungo woolshed and the entrance to the park. A 70 km signposted circular vehicle track allows visitors to drive to the spectacular Walls of China and around the lakes. The shearers' quarters provide bunk accommodation, and a communal kitchen for a daily fee. Camping and other fees may be paid at the visitor centre.Mungo National Park Visitor Guide, NSW NPWS, n.d.
Mungo National Park was acquired for the National Reserve System in 1979 by the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife. This organisation fundraised the $101,000 required to purchase the property. The Foundation also funded a resident archaeologist to work on the site from 1979 to 1983. With funds donated by Dick Smith, the Foundation established the Mungo Visitors Centre and Laboratory in 1983. With further sponsorship from BHP, the Foundation implemented the Mungo National Park 60 km long guided vehicle drive in 1990. In 2010 the Foundation is putting together a prospectus to create a new Centre at Mungo for education and research. If this project goes ahead, the Australian architect and winner of the 2002 Pritzker Prize and 2009 AIA Gold Medal Glen Murcutt, along with Wendy Lewin, will design the building.Involvement of the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife at Mungo National Parkhttp://www.fnpw.org.au/parks-and-reserves/new-south-wales/outback/mungo-national-park/foundation-and-mungo

[[Sydney Harbour National Park]]

CATEGORIES: National parks of New South Wales, Protected areas established in 1975, 1975 establishments in Australia

Sydney Harbour National Park is a national park comprising parts of Sydney Harbour, its foreshores and various islands. The park lies within the Sydney metropolitan area and was created in piecemeal fashion during the 20th century. Much of the harbour foreshores had been spoiled by residential development; what remained was preserved partly because of the presence of military bases, and partly because of the work of conservationists. Early precursors of today's "Greens" were responsible for stopping mining at Ashton Park in the 19th Century. Other places were saved because of people such as the visionary Neil Nielsen, who became the New South Wales Minister for Lands and a strong advocate of a public reserve around Sydney Harbour.
Nielsen was ahead of his time when he used the phrase "national park" in regard to the harbour foreshores, but Sydney eventually caught up with him. It was not possible to undo all the damage done in past decades, but there was still much that could be preserved, and the 1960s were a particularly active time in this regard. The New South Wales Government began buying land around the foreshores in 1965, and the National Trust suggested a national park in 1968. In the following year, the State Government announced a plan whereby it would buy Commonwealth land around the harbour. The Sydney Harbour National Park was finally gazetted in 1975, with Nielsen Park at Shark Bay being added in 1978. Extra land was transferred from Commonwealth to State Government control, and added to the national park in 1979; the historically important quarantine station at Manly was added in 1984.
The park includes Aboriginal sites, military fortifications and historic sites stretching back to the early years of the colony, plus archaeological features and over a thousand engravings at the Quarantine Station. Historic sites include Greycliffe House, erected at Shark Bay by the Wentworth family in neo-Gothic style during the 1850s. There is also a swimming beach at Nielsen Park, a restaurant and a cafe.

The main feature of the park are the lakes, thought to have formed around 15 million years ago by geological activity, the land lifting and largely cutting them off from the local river system. Their outflow is reduced to the small Blue Gum Creek, which flows west into the Little River in the adjacent Nattai National Park to the west.Wright, p. 36.

[[Dentition]]

CATEGORIES: Mammal anatomy, Teeth

Dentition pertains to the development of teeth and their arrangement in the mouth. In particular, it is the characteristic arrangement, kind, and number of teeth in a given species at a given age. That is, the number, type, and morpho-physiology (the physical shape) of the teeth of an animal.
Animals whose teeth are all of the same type, such as most non-mammalian vertebrates, are said to have homodont dentition, whereas those whose teeth differ morphologically are said to have heterodont dentition. The dentition of animals with two successions of teeth (deciduous, permanent) is referred to as diphyodont, while the dentition of animals with only one set of teeth throughout life is monophyodont. The dentition of animals in which the teeth are continuously discarded and replaced throughout life is termed polyphyodont.

[[Cultural resources management]]

CATEGORIES: Arts, Cultural anthropology, Traditions, Conservation and restoration

In the broadest sense, Cultural Resources Management (CRM) is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as the arts and heritage. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of archaeology.  Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as urban culture, rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.
However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with heritage management. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, "used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws." King 1998, p. 6
Cultural resources include both physical assets such as archaeology, architecture, paintings and sculptures and also intangible culture such as folklore and interpretative arts, such as storytelling and drama.UK definition of cultural sector  Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of museums, galleries, theatres etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group.  Cultural tourism is a significant sector of the tourism industry.
At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as languages in danger of extinction, public education, the ethos or operation of multiculturalism, and promoting access to cultural resources.  The Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity is an attempt by the United Nations to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

The Tongva ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|ŋ|v|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|TONG|və[/tpl]) are a Native American people who inhabited the Los Angeles Basin and the Southern Channel Islands, an area covering approximately [tpl]convert|4000|sqmi[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |editor1-first=M.

Gabrieleño and Fernandeño are derived from the names of Spanish missions built on or near the tribes' territory—Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission San Fernando Rey de España, respectively—while Nicoleño is derived from San Nicolas Island.[tpl]efn|Spanish names did not always differentiate between communities or ethnic groups. For example, the Spanish referred to both the Tongva in the San Fernando Valley and the nearby Tataviam people, who spoke a different language, as "Fernandeño."[/tpl] Along with the neighboring Chumash, the Tongva were the most powerful indigenous people to inhabit Southern California. At the time of European contact, they may have numbered 5,000 to 10,000. 
Many lines of evidence suggest that the Tongva are descended of Shoshoni-speaking peoples from Nevada who moved southwest into coastal Southern California 3,500 years ago. These migrants either absorbed or pushed out the Hokan-speaking peoples in the region.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sutton |first1=M.

A hunter-gatherer society, the Tongva traded widely with neighboring peoples. Over time scattered communities came to speak distinct dialects of the Tongva language, part of the Takic subgroup of the Uto-Aztecan language family. There may have been five or more such dialects (three on the Channel Islands and at least two on the mainland). The Tongva language become extinct in the twentieth century, but a reconstructed form continues to be spoken today. 
Initial Spanish exploration of the Los Angeles area occurred in 1542, but sustained contact with the Tongva came only after Mission San Gabriel Arcángel was constructed in 1771. This marked the beginning of an era of forced relocation and exposure to Old World diseases, leading to the rapid collapse of the Tongva population.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Castillo |first1=E.

In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain and the government sold mission lands to ranchers, forcing the Tongva to culturally assimilate. Three decades later California was ceded to the United States and the government signed treaties with the Tongva promising [tpl]convert|8.5|e6acre[/tpl] of land for reservations, but these treaties were never ratified.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_1101-1150/sb_1134_bill_20080131_introduced.html |title=Senate Bill No. 1134 |last1=Oropeza |first1=J. |authorlink1=Jenny Oropeza |last2=Scott |first2=J. |authorlink2=Jack Scott (California politician) |last3=Yee |first3=L. |authorlink3=Leland Yee |last4=Davis |first4=M. |authorlink4=Mike Davis (politician) |last5=Karnette |first5=B. |authorlink5=Betty Karnette |date=January 31, 2008 |website=California Legislative Information |publisher=Legislative Counsel of California |accessdate=19 August 2013[/tpl] By the turn of the century the Island Tongva had disappeared and the mainland communities were also nearing extinction.

Henry "Henny" Youngman (original Yiddish surname Yungman; 16 March 1906 – 24 February 1998) was a British-born American comedian and violinist famous for "one-liners" - short, simple jokes delivered rapid-fire. His best known one-liner was "Take my wife ... please."
In a time when many comedians told elaborate anecdotes, Youngman's routine consisted of telling simple one-liner jokes, occasionally with interludes of violin playing. These depicted simple, cartoon-like situations, eliminating lengthy build-ups and going straight to the punch line. He was known as the King of the One Liners, a title given him by columnist Walter Winchell. A stage performance by Youngman lasted only fifteen to twenty minutes, but it contained dozens of jokes, delivered one right after the other.

Since the American Revolution, Maryland has had a number of state constitutions that have specified different terms of office and methods of selection of its Governors. Under the constitution of 1776, the Governors were appointed by the legislature to one year terms. An 1838 constitutional amendment allowed the direct election of Governors to three-year terms, although the Governors came from rotating election districts. The terms were lengthened to four years in the 1851 Constitution and the election districts were abolished in the 1864 version.

CATEGORIES: Sound recording

Low fidelity or lo fi (adjectival form "low-fidelity" or "lo-fi") is a type of sound recording which contains technical flaws that make the recording sound different compared with the live sound being recorded, such as distortion, hum, background noise, or limited frequency response. The term "low-fidelity" is used in contrast to the audiophile term high fidelity or "hi-fi", which refers to stereo equipment that very accurately reproduces music without harmonic distortion or unwanted frequency emphasis or resonance. The ideas of lo-fi are taken to extremes by the genre or "scene" of no fidelity, or no-fi. Some lower-budget recordings from the 1970s and 1980s have a "lo-fi" sound because of the limitations of the analog recording and processing techniques of the time, which introduced unwanted artifacts such as distortion and phase problems. In some recordings, however, high fidelity recording is purposely avoided, or the artifacts such as simulated vinyl record crackles are deliberately retained or added in for aesthetic or historical reasons.
Some unique aural qualities are available only with "low-tech" recording methods, such as recording on tape decks, or using analog sound processors (e.g., analog compressors or reverb units).  The lo-fi aesthetic has even contributed to musical subgenres, such as the "lo-fi" subgenre of indie rock and a great deal of punk rock.[tpl]cite web|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/genres/a/lo-fi.htm|author=Anthony Carew|publisher=About.com Guide|title=Genre Profile - Lo-Fi[/tpl] Lo-fi techniques are espoused by some genres outside the indie rock world, particularly by certain heavy metal bands (especially within the sludge and black metal scenes), where the very low-quality of the recording has become a desirable quality, as it is associated with authenticity, as well as a "darker" sound or a "rebellion" against good production.
In digital audio, the term "lo-fi" usually refers to an audio file with a lower bit rate or sampling rate, and thus a lower sound quality. Such audio files may be offered on the internet because of their smaller file sizes and hence shorter download times. The term "lo-fi" has come to be used figuratively in other contexts, by analogy with lo-fi audio, usually to mean "low-tech", such as websites with very simple architecture or designed for users with low bandwidth connections.

She is also one of the chief Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses, who are attendants of the warrior goddess Durga.Wangu p.114 The name is a combination of Chanda and Munda, two monsters whom Chamunda killed. She is closely associated with Kali, another fierce aspect of Devi.Wangu p.72 She is sometimes identified with goddesses Parvati, Chandi or Durga as well. The goddess is often portrayed as haunting cremation grounds or fig trees. The goddess is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine and in the ancient times, human sacrifices were offered too. Originally a tribal goddess, Chamunda was assimilated in Hinduism and later entered the Jain pantheon too. Though in Jainism, the rites of her worship include vegetarian offerings, and not the meat and liquor offerings.

[[Pearson hashing]]

Pearson hashing[ref]
</ref><ref>[http://cs.mwsu.edu/~griffin/courses/2133/downloads/Spring11/p677-pearson.pdf Online PDF file of the CACM paper].</ref> is a [[hash function]] designed for fast execution on processors with 8-bit [[processor register|register]]s. Given an input consisting of any number of bytes, it produces as output a single byte that is strongly dependent<ref name=acmref/> on every byte of the input. Its implementation requires only a few instructions, plus a 256-byte [[lookup table]] containing a [[permutation]] of the values 0 through 255.
This hash function is a CBC-MAC that uses an 8-bit random block cipher implemented via the permutation table. An 8-bit
block cipher has negligible cryptographic security, so the Pearson hash function is not cryptographically strong; but it offers these benefits:
One of its drawbacks when compared with other hashing algorithms designed for 8-bit processors is the suggested 256 byte lookup table, which can be prohibitively large for a small microcontroller with a program memory size on the order of hundreds of bytes. A workaround to this is to use a simple permutation function instead of a table stored in program memory. However, using a too simple function, such as Ti = 255-i partly defeats the usability as a hash function as anagrams will result in the same hash value; using a too complex function, on the other hand, will affect speed negatively.
The algorithm can be described by the following pseudocode, which computes the hash of message C using the permutation table T:

 h := 0
 '''for each''' c '''in''' C '''loop'''
   index := h '''xor''' c
   h := T[index]
 '''end loop'''
 '''return''' h

Chartism was a working-class movement for political reform in Britain which existed from 1838 to 1850 (although there was a slow fade-out in the movement after 1848) and which took its name from the People's Charter of 1838. It was a national protest movement, with particular strongholds of support in the north of England, the east Midlands, the Potteries, the Black Country and south Wales. Support for the movement was at its highest in 1839, 1842 and 1848 when petitions signed by millions of working people were presented to the House of Commons. The strategy employed was to use the scale of support these petitions and the accompanying mass meetings demonstrated to put pressure on politicians to concede manhood suffrage.  Chartism thus relied on constitutional methods to secure its aims, though there were some who became involved in insurrectionary activities, notably in south Wales and Yorkshire.
The People's Charter called for six reforms to make the political system more democratic:
Chartism can be interpreted as a continuation of the 18th century fight against corruption and for democracy in an industrial society, but it attracted considerably more support than the radical groups of that time, and economic causes of support for the movement – wage cuts, unemployment etc – should not be played down.Malcolm Chase, Chartism: A New History (2007)Boyd Hilton, A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England 1783–1846 (2006) pp 612–21

Karen Ann Quinlan (March 29, 1954 – June 11, 1985) was an important figure in the history of the right to die controversy in the United States. 
When she was 22, Quinlan became unconscious   after arriving home from a party. She had consumed diazepam, dextropropoxyphene, and alcohol (however, it is disputed whether any drugs (diazepam, dextropropoxyphene) were found in her system). After she collapsed and stopped breathing twice for 15 minutes or more, the paramedics arrived and took her to a hospital, where she lapsed into a persistent vegetative state. After she was kept alive on a ventilator for several months without improvement, her parents requested the hospital to discontinue active care and allow her to die. The hospital refused, and the subsequent legal battles made newspaper headlines and set significant precedents. The New Jersey Supreme Court eventually ruled in her parents' favor.  Although Quinlan was removed from mechanical ventilation during 1976, she lived on in a persistent vegetative state for almost a decade until her death from pneumonia in 1985. 
Quinlan's case continues to raise important questions in moral theology, bioethics, euthanasia, legal guardianship and civil rights. Her case has affected the practice of medicine and law around the world. A significant outcome of her case was the development of formal ethics committees in hospitals, nursing homes and hospices.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]

The coat of arms is a shield with the image of Mount Triglav, Slovenia's highest peak, in white against a blue background at the centre; beneath it are two wavy blue lines representing the Adriatic Sea and local rivers, and above it are three six-pointed golden stars arranged in an inverted triangle which are taken from the coat of arms of the Counts of Celje, the great Slovenian dynastic house of the late 14th and early 15th centuries.The Government's site about the flag
The flag's colours are considered to be Pan-Slavic, but they actually come from the medieval coat of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, consisting of a blue eagle on a white background with a red-and-gold crescent.http://www.dz-rs.si/index.php?id=112 The existing Slovene tricolor was raised for the first time in history during the Revolution of 1848 by the Slovene Romantic nationalist activist and poet Lovro Toman on 7 April 1848, in Ljubljana, in response to a German flag which was raised on top of Ljubljana Castle.Celebration of the Slovene Tricolor (In Slovene: "Praznik slovenske trobojnice"), MMC RTV Slovenia, 7. april 2013

[[Piazza San Marco]]

Piazza San Marco ([tpl]IPA-it|ˈpjatt͡sa san ˈmarko[/tpl], often known in English as St Mark's Square), is the principal public square of Venice, Italy, where it is generally known just as "the Piazza" (la Piazza). All other urban spaces in the city (except the Piazzetta and the Piazzale Roma) are called "campi" (fields). The Piazzetta (the 'little Piazza') is an extension of the Piazza towards the lagoon in its south east corner (see plan). The two spaces together form the social, religious and political centre of Venice and are commonly considered together. This article relates to both of them.
A remark usually attributed to Napoleon calls the Piazza San Marco "the drawing room of Europe" (the attribution to Napoleon is unproven).Margaret Plant has looked into the history of this "felicitous and much-used metaphor" but has to say that evidence for Napoleon's authorship is elusive. The earliest reference which she can quote is from a French guide book of 1844 which said (without citing any authority) that Napoleon said that the Piazza is a salon designed for the sky to serve as a canopy.

The César Award is considered the highest film honor in France, the French film industry's equivalent to the Molière Award for theatre, and the Victoires de la Musique for music. In cinema, it is to France what the Academy Award (Oscar) is to the United States.
The award was created by Georges Cravenne, who was also the creator of the Molière Award for theatre. The name of the award comes from the sculptor César Baldaccini (1921–1998) who created it.
The 39th César Awards were presented on 28 February 2014, with Cécile de France acting as the mistress of ceremonies and François Cluzet as the chairman of the ceremony.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/frances-cesar-awards-nominations-announced-675607 |title=Berenice Bejo, Lea Seydoux, Roman Polanski Among France's Cesar Awards Nominees |accessdate=13 February 2014 |work=Hollywood Reporter[/tpl]

[[AGA cooker]]

CATEGORIES: Fireplaces, Cooking appliance brands, British brands

The AGA cooker is a heat storage stove and cooker, which works on the principle that a heavy frame made from cast iron components can absorb heat from a relatively low-intensity but continuously-burning source, and the accumulated heat can then be used when needed for cooking.  Originally heated by slow-burning coal, the Aga cooker was invented in 1922 by the Nobel Prize-winning Swedish physicist Gustaf Dalén (1869–1937), who was employed first as the chief engineer of the Swedish AGA company (Swedish: Aktiebolaget Svenska Gasaccumulator, English: Joint stock company Swedish Gas Accumulator). The cookers were first imported to Britain in 1929, and were first manufactured there under licence in the early 1930s.  The cast iron components were first cast at the Coalbrookdale foundry in the 1940s, where they are still made today by the Aga Rangemaster Group.
AGA [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|ɡ|ə[/tpl]Macmillan Dictionary is an abbreviation of the company name, Aktiebolaget Gas Accumulator.

[[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture]]
CATEGORIES: Amiga, Graphics chips, AmigaOS

Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) is the third generation Amiga graphic chip set, first used in the Amiga 4000 in 1992. Before release AGA was codenamed Pandora by Commodore International.
AGA was originally called AA for Advanced Architecture in the United States. The name was later changed to AGA for the European market to reflect that it largely improved the graphical subsystem, and to avoid trademark issues.The Amiga AGA Chipset
AGA is able to display graphics modes with a depth of up to [tpl]nowrap|8 bit[/tpl] per pixel. This allows for [tpl]nowrap|256 colors[/tpl] in indexed display modes and [tpl]nowrap|262 144 colors[/tpl] (18-bit) in HAM-8 (Hold-And-Modify) modes. The palette for the AGA chipset has 256 entries from [tpl]nowrap|16 777 216 colors[/tpl] (24-bit), whereas previous chip sets (OCS and ECS) only allowed [tpl]nowrap|32 colors[/tpl] out of 4096 (64 colors in EHB mode). Other features added to AGA over ECS were super hires smooth scrolling and 32-bit fast page memory fetches to supply the graphics data bandwidth for 8 bitplane graphics modes and wider sprites.
AGA was an incremental upgrade, rather than the dramatic upgrade of the other chipset that Commodore had begun in 1988, AAA, lacking many features that would have made it competitive with other graphic chip sets of its time. Apart from the graphics data fetches, AGA still operates on 16-bit data only, meaning that a lot of bandwidth is wasted during register accesses and copper and blitter operations. Also the lack of a chunky graphics mode is a speed impediment to graphics operations not tailored for planar modes.  In practice, the AGA HAM (Hold-And-Modify) mode is mainly useful in painting programs, picture viewers and for video playback.  Workbench in 256 colors is much slower than ECS operation modes for normal application use; a workaround is to use multiple screens with different color depths.  AGA also lacks flicker free higher resolution modes, being only able to display [tpl]nowrap|640 × 480[/tpl] at [tpl]nowrap|72 Hz[/tpl] flicker-free operation.  [tpl]nowrap|800 × 600[/tpl] mode is rarely used as it could only operate at a flickering [tpl]nowrap|60 Hz[/tpl] interlaced mode.  In contrast, higher-end PC systems of this era could operate [tpl]nowrap|1024 × 768[/tpl] at [tpl]nowrap|72 Hz[/tpl] with a full 256-color display. AGA's highest resolution is [tpl]nowrap|1440 × 580[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|(262 144 colors)[/tpl] in interlaced [tpl]nowrap|50 Hz[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|PAL mode,[/tpl] when overscan was used. 
These missed opportunities in the AGA upgrade contributed to the Amiga ultimately losing technical leadership in the multimedia area. AGA was to be succeeded by the Hombre chipset, after the long delayed AAA was finally shelved, which was ultimately cancelled due to Commodore's bankruptcy.
AGA was used in the CD32, Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000.

Route 41 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs [tpl]convert|14.08|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from the five-way intersection of Route 47 (Delsea Drive), County Route 603 (Fairview-Sewell Road/Blackswood-Barnsboro Road), and County Route 630 (Egg Harbor Road), also known as Five Points, in Deptford Township, Gloucester County to the southern terminus of County Route 611 in Maple Shade, Burlington County, just north of the Route 41's interchanges with Route 38 and Route 73. The route is a two- to four-lane suburban road that passes through several communities, including Runnemede, Haddonfield, and Cherry Hill Township. Between the intersection with Route 168 in Runnemede and Route 154 in Cherry Hill Township, Route 41 is maintained by Camden County and is also signed as County Route 573.
Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 47 in Fairview, Deptford Township to Route 38 in Moorestown. Originally, the route was intended to bypass Haddonfield, however this bypass was never fully completed and Route 41 was signed along a temporary county-maintained alignment that also became County Route 573. The northern part of this bypass was completed and became Route 154 in 1953. The road has seen many changes including the replacement of the traffic circle with Routes 38 and 73 with an interchange that involved realigning Route 41 around the original circle in 1960 and the replacement of the Ellisburg Circle at Routes 70 and 154 with a signalized intersection in the early 1990s. The temporary alignment of Route 41 along County Route 573 was made permanent in the early 2000s.

Four conferences have been held so far, in 1978, 1983, 2001, and 2009. Founded after World War II and the Holocaust as a dependent body of the United Nations, UNESCO started as soon as it was created to promote scientific studies concerning ethnic groups and their diffusion in public opinion to dispel pseudo-scientific rationalizations of racism. One of its first published works was The Race Question in 1950, signed by various internationally renowned scholars.

The route is a mix of freeway and divided four-lane arterial road. The southern portion of Route 42 is a local arterial route and one of several highways comprising the Black Horse Pike, a road that runs from Camden to Atlantic City. The northern portion is a six- to eight-lane freeway referred to locally as the North–South Freeway (or simply the 42 Freeway[tpl]cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=6276126|title=Man injured after allegedly car surfing on I-295|date=July 20, 2008|publisher=WPVI-TV|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl]) that is directly connected to the Atlantic City Expressway.  Major intersections along the route include the Atlantic City Expressway and the southern terminus of Route 168 in Turnersville, another intersection with Route 168 in Blackwood, and Route 41 and Route 55 in Deptford Township.
Route 42 was originally designated in 1927 to run along the Black Horse Pike between Ferry Avenue in Camden and the present U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 322 split in the McKee City section of Hamilton Township, Atlantic County. In 1953, the southern terminus was cut back to its current terminus in the Williamstown section of Monroe Township to avoid the concurrency it shared with U.S. Route 322. After the completion of the North–South Freeway between Bellmawr and Turnersville in 1959, Route 42 was moved to this freeway, and the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168. The freeway portion of Route 42 has been improved many times and is projected to see more improvements, including reconstruction of the dangerous and congested interchange with Interstate 76 and Interstate 295 in Bellmawr.

Route 44 is a state highway located in Gloucester County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs [tpl]convert|10.28|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from Barker Avenue in Bridgeport to a cul-de-sac at a ramp from southbound Interstate 295 (I-295) and U.S. Route 130 (US 130) in Thorofare. The route, which is mostly a two-lane undivided road, passes through the communities of Gibbstown and Paulsboro in the northern part of the county, a short distance south of the Delaware River. Route 44 generally runs a short distance to the north of I-295/US 130 for much of its length.
In 1923, Route 17S was legislated along the current route followed by Route 44 today, running between Penns Grove and Westville. The only portion of Route 17S ever built ran from Penns Grove to Salem. Route 44 was designated in 1927 to replace Route 17S between Penns Grove and Westville. By the 1940s, Route 44 was extended south to Salem and US 130 was designated concurrent with the route north of Penns Grove. Several spurs of Route 44 had existed or were planned prior to 1953, including Route S44, which ran concurrent with US 322 to the ferry between Bridgeport and Chester, Pennsylvania; Route S44A, a never-built bypass of Camden; and Route 44T, which was to run from a tunnel under the Delaware River in Paulsboro east to Route 42. In 1953, Route 44 was replaced by US 130 north of Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there. After two bypasses were built for US 130 around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville, Route 44 was redesignated along the former US 130. After I-295 was completed in the 1960s, US 130 returned to its original alignment in Carneys Point and replaced that portion of Route 44.

[[New Jersey Route 45]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Gloucester County, New Jersey, Transportation in Salem County, New Jersey

Route 45 is a state highway in the southern part of New Jersey, United States. It runs [tpl]convert|28.51|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from Route 49 in Salem, Salem County, northeast to U.S. Route 130 in Westville, Gloucester County. Much of the southern part of the route runs through rural areas of Salem and Gloucester counties, passing through the communities of Woodstown and Mullica Hill. North of Mullica Hill, Route 45 runs through suburban areas, with the portion of the route between the northern border of Mantua Township and the southern border of Woodbury a four-lane divided highway. The route intersects many highways, including U.S. Route 40 in Woodstown, Route 77 and U.S. Route 322 in Mullica Hill, and Interstate 295 in West Deptford Township.
The current route was originally a segment of pre-1927 Route 6 that was created in 1917, running from Salem to Camden. Route 45 was designated in 1927 to replace the Salem-Camden branch of pre-1927 Route 6 and was eventually realigned to follow U.S. Route 130 (Crescent Boulevard) to the Airport Circle in Pennsauken Township. The northern terminus of Route 45 was moved to its current location in 1953 in order to avoid the concurrency with U.S. Route 130. A freeway for Route 45 between Interstate 295 in Woodbury and U.S. Route 322 in Mullica Hill was recommended by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission in the 1960s. It was never built, and the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed widening all of Route 45 into a four-lane divided highway; only a small portion in northern Gloucester County was widened.

Route 47 is a state highway in the southern part of New Jersey, United States. It runs [tpl]convert|75.20|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from Atlantic Avenue in Wildwood, Cape May County north to U.S. Route 130 in Brooklawn, Camden County. It is also referred to as Delsea Drive, as it connects the Delaware River near Brooklawn to the Atlantic Ocean (the sea) in Wildwood. This name was assigned by the New Jersey Legislature in 1933. The route runs through rural areas of Cape May and southern Cumberland counties as a two-lane road. Traffic jams along this portion of Route 47 are commonplace in the summer vacation season and can stretch for miles due to the missing southern section of Route 55, where all Jersey Shore-bound traffic enters the small two-lane road. North of here, the route runs through the cities of Millville and Vineland before entering Gloucester County, where it passes through more rural areas as well as Clayton and Glassboro. Past Glassboro, it heads through suburban areas in Washington and Deptford townships before running through Westville and Brooklawn. Route 47 is the longest state route in New Jersey.
What is now Route 47 was originally designated as part of pre-1927 Route 15 between Rio Grande in 1917 and as a branch of pre-1927 Route 20 between Millville and Westville in 1923. In 1927, Route 47 was designated to run from Tuckahoe to Brooklawn, following current Route 49 south of Millville. Meanwhile, current Route 47 was a part of Route 49 between South Dennis and Millville and Route S49 between Rio Grande and South Dennis. The latter was extended to Wildwood in 1938. Route 47 and Route 49 were shifted onto their current alignments south of Millville in 1953. Since then, Route 47 has seen a few improvements and modifications including realignment in Millville and the reconstruction of the intersection with Route 83 in Dennis Township.

Uno is a small unincorporated community in Hart County, Kentucky, United States, located east and slightly north of Horse Cave on U.S. Route 31E.  Its name is pronounced as "You know."  This is in reference to the historical practice of the selling of moonshine whiskey during prohibition.  Another name for this community is Clearpoint, Kentucky, which is derived from "Clear Pint", again in reference to its historical past as a location at which to buy moonshine.  The Clearpoint Presbyterian Church, located here, retains the old name.
The most famous business here for many years was the first Smith's Country Store, where country hams were sold. The second store in the chain was opened in Cave City, Kentucky, in nearby Barren County.

[[New Jersey Route 48]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Salem County, New Jersey

Route 48 is an east–west state highway in Salem County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a [tpl]convert|4.26|mi|km|2|adj=on[/tpl] route running from U.S. Route 130 (Virginia Avenue) and County Route 675 (Main Street) in Penns Grove to U.S. Route 40 (Wiley Road) in Carneys Point Township. It is known as East Main Street from U.S. Route 130 to DuPont Road, and as the Harding Highway from DuPont Road to its terminus at U.S. Route 40. Route 48 is signed east–west, although it travels more northwest-southeast throughout its route. It is a two-lane, undivided road through its entire length that intersects with Interstate 295 and County Route 551.
The road was originally created as Route 18S, running from Penns Grove to Atlantic City, in 1923, before becoming Route 48 in 1927. In Penns Grove, the route ended at a ferry which crossed the Delaware River to Wilmington, Delaware, connecting with Delaware Route 48 until the ferry service was terminated in 1951, when the Delaware Memorial Bridge opened. U.S. Route 40 was also designated to run along the entire length of the route between Penns Grove and Atlantic City. On two occasions, U.S. Route 40 has been relocated off portions of Route 48: once following a realignment to a ferry between New Castle, Delaware and Pennsville and again after the Delaware Memorial Bridge and New Jersey Turnpike opened in 1951. Route 48 was designated onto its current alignment in 1953, eliminating the concurrency it shared with U.S. Route 40 from Carneys Point Township to Atlantic City.

Route 49 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs [tpl]convert|53.80|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from an interchange with the Delaware Memorial Bridge extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 295 and U.S. Route 40) in Deepwater, Salem County, where it continues north as U.S. Route 130 southeast to Route 50 and County Route 557 in Tuckahoe, Cape May County. The route serves Salem, Cumberland, Atlantic, and Cape May Counties, passing through rural areas and the communities of Salem, Bridgeton, and Millville along the way. It is a two-lane, undivided road for most of its length.
Route 49 was established in 1927 to run from Salem to Clermont, running along its present alignment between Salem and Millville, following current Route 47 between Millville and South Dennis, and running along present-day Route 83 between South Dennis and Clermont. It replaced  a branch of pre-1927 Route 6 between Salem and Bridgeton and a part of pre-1927 Route 15 between Bridgeton and South Dennis. In 1953, Route 49 was routed onto its current alignment, replacing a part of Route 44 between Salem and Deepwater and following the former alignment of Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe. In the 1960s, a freeway was planned for Route 49 between Deepwater and Millville; it was never built. In the 2000s, many improvements have been or are being made to bridges along Route 49.

Yellowknife [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɛ|l|oʊ|n|aɪ|f[/tpl] (2011 population:
19,234) is the capital city and largest community of the Northwest Territories (NT or NWT), Canada. It is located on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, approximately [tpl]convert|400|km|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River. Yellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe once known as the 'Copper Indians' or 'Yellowknife Indians' (now referred to locally as the Yellowknives Dene (First Nation)) who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. The current population is ethnically mixed. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as Somba K’e (Som-ba Kay) ("where the money is").
The Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although the first evidence of a community with commerce did not emerge until 1936. Yellowknife soon became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and became the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to being a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of Yellowknife in 1991, this shift has begun to reverse.

The SM-65 Atlas was the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) developed and deployed by the United States.  It was built for the U.S. Air Force by Convair Division of General Dynamics at the Kearny Mesa assembly plant north of San Diego, California. Atlas became operational as an ICBM in October 1959 and was used as a first stage for satellite launch vehicles for half a century. The Atlas missile's warhead was over 100 times more powerful than the bomb dropped over Nagasaki in 1945.
An initial development contract was given to Consolidated Vultee Aircraft (Convair) on 16 January 1951 for what was then called MX-1593, but at a relatively low priority. The 1953 testing of the first dry fuel H-bomb in the Soviet Union led to the project being dramatically accelerated. The initial design completed by Convair in 1953 was larger than the missile that eventually entered service. Estimated warhead weight was lowered from [tpl]convert|8000|lb|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|3000|lb|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] based on highly favorable U.S. nuclear warhead tests in early 1954, and on 14 May 1954 the Atlas program was formally given the highest national priority.  A major development and test contract was awarded to Convair on 14 January 1955 for a [tpl]convert|10|ft|0|sing=on[/tpl] diameter missile to weigh about [tpl]convert|250,000|lb|-2|abbr=on[/tpl].Dennis R. Jenkins, "Stage-and-a-Half, The Atlas Launch Vehicle", To Reach the High Frontier (University Press of Kentucky, 2002) pp. 74-85 Atlas development was tightly controlled by the Air Force's Western Development Division, WDD, later part of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division. Contracts for warhead, guidance and propulsion were handled separately by WDD. The first successful flight of a highly instrumented Atlas missile to full range occurred 28 November 1958. Atlas ICBMs were deployed operationally from 31 October 1959 to 12 April 1965.Mike Gruntman, Blazing the Trail, pp. 221-245, AIAA, Reston Virginia, 2004
On 18 December 1958, the launch of Atlas 10B sent the missile into orbit around the Earth (without use of an upper stage) carrying the "SCORE" (Signal Communications by Orbiting Relay Equipment) communications payload. Atlas 10B/SCORE, at [tpl]convert|8750|lb|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] was the heaviest man-made object then in orbit, the first voice relay satellite, and the first man-made object in space easily visible to the naked eye due to the large, mirror-polished stainless steel tank. This was the first flight in what would be a long career for the Atlas as a satellite launcher. Many retired Atlas ICBMs would be used as launch vehicles, most with an added spin-stabilized solid rocket motor upper stage for polar orbit military payloads. Even before its military use ended in 1965, Atlas had placed four Project Mercury astronauts in orbit and was becoming the foundation for a family of successful space launch vehicles, most notably Atlas Agena and Atlas Centaur.
Mergers led to the acquisition of the Atlas Centaur line by Lockheed Martin which in turn became part of the United Launch Alliance. Today Lockheed Martin and ULA support a new Atlas rocket family based on the larger "Atlas V" which still uses the unique and highly efficient Centaur upper stage. Atlas V stage one is powered by a Russian RD-180 oxygen/kerosene engine and uses conventional aluminum isogrid tankage rather than the thin-wall, pressure-stabilized stainless steel tanks of the original Convair Atlas. Payload weights have increased along with launch vehicle weights over the years so the current Atlas V family serves many of the same type commercial, DoD, and planetary missions as earlier Atlas Centaurs.

Hamlet is a 1996 film version of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, adapted for the screen and directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also stars in the titular role as Prince Hamlet. The film also features Derek Jacobi as King Claudius, Julie Christie as Queen Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Michael Maloney as Laertes, Richard Briers as Polonius, and Nicholas Farrell as Horatio. Other notable appearances include Robin Williams, Gérard Depardieu, Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, Rufus Sewell, Charlton Heston, Richard Attenborough, Judi Dench, John Gielgud and Ken Dodd.
The film is notable as the first unabridged theatrical film version of the play, running just over four hours. The longest screen version of the play prior to the 1996 film was the 1980 BBC made-for-television version starring Derek Jacobi, which runs three-and-a-half hours.
The play's setting is updated to the 19th century, but its Elizabethan English remains the same. Blenheim Palace is the setting used for the exterior grounds of Elsinore Castle and interiors were all photographed at Shepperton Studios, blended with the footage shot at Blenheim.  Hamlet was also the last major dramatic motion picture to be filmed entirely on 70 mm film until 2012, with the release of Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master.
Hamlet was highly acclaimed by the majority of critics and has been regarded as one of the best Shakespeare film adaptations ever made. However, it was not a box office success, grossing just under $5 million on a budget of $18 million. The film received four Academy Award nominations for the 69th Academy Awards for Best Art Direction (Tim Harvey), Best Costume Design (Alexandra Byrne), Best Original Score (Patrick Doyle), and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) (Kenneth Branagh).

As with other authors of the Second Sophistic, Arrian wrote primarily in Attic (Indica is in Herodotus' Ionic dialect, his philosophical works in Koine Greek).
The Anabasis of Alexander is perhaps his best-known work, and is generally considered one of the best sources on the campaigns of Alexander the Great. (It is not to be confused with  Anabasis, the best-known work of the Athenian military leader and author Xenophon from the 5th-4th century BC.)  Arrian is also considered as one of the founders of a primarily military-based focus on history.  His other works include Discourses of Epictetus and Indica.

Nearchus ([tpl]lang-el|Νέαρχος[/tpl], Nearchos; c. 360 – 300 BC) was one of the officers, a navarch, in the army of Alexander the Great. His celebrated voyage from what is now Pakistan to Susa after Alexander's expedition in north-western Indian subcontinent is preserved in Arrian's account, the Indica.
A native of Lato[ref]Who's who in the Age of Alexander the Great: Prosopography of Alexander's Empire
 By Waldemar Heckel Page 171 ISBN 1-4051-1210-7</ref> in [[Crete]] and son of [[Androtimus]],<ref>[http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nearchus/nearchus.html Livius history]</ref> his family settled at [[Amphipolis]] in [[Macedon]]ia at some point during [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II’s]] reign (we must assume after Philip took the city in 357 BC), at which point Nearchus was probably a young boy. He was almost certainly older than Alexander, as were [[Ptolemy I|Ptolemy]], [[Erigyius]], and the others of the ‘boyhood friends’;<ref>Heckel, "Marshals" p.228</ref> so depending on when [[Androtimus]] came to Macedonia Nearchus was quite possibly ''born'' on Crete.
Nearchus, along with Ptolemy, Erigyius and Laomedon, and Harpalus, was one of Alexander’s ‘mentors’ – and he was exiled by Philip as a result of the Pixodarus affair (A 3.6.5; P 10.4). It is not known where the exiles went, but they were recalled only after Philip’s death, on Alexander’s accession.
After their recall, these men were held in the highest honour. Nearchus was appointed as satrap of Lycia and Pamphylia in 334/3 BC (A 3.3.6), one of the earliest of Alexander's satrapal appointments. In 328 BC he was relieved of his post and rejoined Alexander in Bactria, bringing with him reinforcements (A 4.7.2; C 7.10.4, but does not mention Nearchus himself). After the siege of Aornus Nearchus was sent at the head of a reconnaissance mission – especially to find out about elephants (A 4.30.5–6).
In 326 BC, Nearchus was made admiral of the fleet that Alexander had built at the Hydaspes (A 6.2.3; Indica 18.10). However, his trierarchy was a financial responsibility – that is, Nearchus put up the money for the boats (Heckel, p. 229); and there were plenty of other trierarchs in the Indus fleet who were not natural born sailors.
During the voyage some of the ships were damaged, and Nearchus was instructed to remain behind to oversee repairs, before continuing down the river. This perhaps indicates some knowledge of shipbuilding, but he could hardly have been the only one qualified.
However, he remained in command of the fleet for the voyage from the Indus to the Persian Gulf, which he recorded in detail (and which was used extensively for Arrian’s Indica). Again, although he was the admiral, in command of the fleet, great seamanship was not required – the naval responsibilities were Onesicritus’. During the voyage, Nearchus was reputedly the first Greek commander to visit Bahrain, which was called Tylos by the Greeks. His visit marked the start of Bahrain's inclusion within the Hellenic world, which culminated in the worship of Zeus (as the Arab sun god, Shams) and Greek being spoken as the language of the upper classes.
After many adventures, Nearchus arrived in Carmania, meeting up with Alexander after the latter’s crossing of the Gedrosian desert. Alexander sent him off to complete his voyage – he went as far as the Euphrates before turning back to rejoin Alexander at Susa, in early 324 BC.
Nearchus married the daughter of Barsine and Mentor (A 7.4.6), and received a crown as recognition of his exertions (A 7.5.6). He then took the fleet up to Babylon, where he gave Alexander the Chaldeans’ warning not to enter the city (P 73.1–2).
Nearchus had a place in Alexander’s final plans, as he was to be the admiral of the Arabian invasion fleet; but the plans were cut short by the king’s death.
In the initial arguments over the rule of the empire Nearchus supported Heracles, Alexander’s son by Barsine – the king’s mistress was now his mother-in-law. Once order broke down he joined Antigonus’ camp. His last mention is as an adviser to Demetrius in 313/2 BC (D 19.69.1); what happened after that is not known, although he probably retired to write his history.

[[Shotgun debugging]]
CATEGORIES: Threads (computing), Debugging, Anti-patterns

Shotgun debugging is a process of making relatively undirected changes to software in the hope that a bug will be perturbed out of existence. This almost never works except in very simple programs, or when used as an attempt to work around programming language features that one may be using improperly; it usually introduces more bugs[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl].

[[Virtual LAN]]

CATEGORIES: Local area networks, Network protocols

In computer networking, a single layer-2 network may be partitioned to create multiple distinct broadcast domains, which are mutually isolated so that packets can only pass between them via one or more routers; such a domain is referred to as a virtual local area network, virtual LAN or VLAN.
This is usually achieved on switch or router devices. Simpler devices only support partitioning on a port level (if at all), so sharing VLANs across devices requires running dedicated cabling for each VLAN. More sophisticated devices can mark packets through tagging, so that a single interconnect (trunk) may be used to transport data for various VLANs.
Grouping hosts with a common set of requirements regardless of their physical location by VLAN can greatly simplify network design. A VLAN has the same attributes as a physical local area network (LAN), but it allows for end stations to be grouped together more easily even if they are not on the same network switch. VLAN membership can be configured through software instead of physically relocating devices or connections.  Most enterprise-level networks today use the concept of virtual LANs. Without VLANs, a switch considers all interfaces on the switch to be in the same broadcast domain. 
To physically replicate the functions of a VLAN would require a separate, parallel collection of network cables and equipment separate from the primary network. However, unlike physically separate networks, VLANs share bandwidth, so VLAN trunks may require aggregated links and/or quality of service prioritization.

A marabout ([tpl]lang-ar|مَربوط[/tpl] marbūṭ or [tpl]lang|ar|مُرابِط[/tpl] murābiṭ, "one who is attached/garrisoned") is a Muslim religious leader and teacher in West Africa, and (historically) in the Maghreb. The marabout is often a scholar of the Qur'an, or religious teacher.  Others may be wandering holy men who survive on alms, Sufi Murshids ("Guides"), or leaders of religious communities.  Still others keep alive syncretic pre-Islamic traditions, making amulets for good luck, presiding at various ceremonies, telling the future, and in some cases actively guiding the lives of followers. The common practice of receiving gifts or money for this service is disapproved of by orthodox Muslims.

[[Serial Line Internet Protocol]]

CATEGORIES: Internet protocols, Link protocols, Logical link control

The Serial Line Internet Protocol (also Serial Line Interface Protocol; SLIP) is an encapsulation of the Internet Protocol designed to work over serial ports and modem connections. It is documented in RFC 1055. On personal computers, SLIP has been largely replaced by the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is better engineered, has more features and does not require its IP address configuration to be set before it is established. On microcontrollers, however, SLIP is still the preferred way of encapsulating IP packets due to its very small overhead.

[[Cap-Vert]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms of Senegal, Headlands of Africa, Peninsulas of Africa, Dakar

Cap-Vert is a peninsula in Senegal, and the westernmost point of the continent of Africa and of the Old World mainland.  Originally called Cabo Verde or "Green Cape" by Portuguese explorers, it is not to be confused with the Cape Verde islands, which are some [tpl]convert|560|km[/tpl] further west.  Dakar, the capital of Senegal,  is located near the southern tip.  
Cap-Vert is a rocky promontory extending west from the main sandy areas of Senegal. Cap-Vert has an excellent harbor, facing Gorée Island.
Formed by a combination of volcanic offshore islands and a land bridge produced by coastal currents, it projects into the Atlantic Ocean, bending back to the southeast at its tip. Exposure to southwesterly winds contributes to Cape Verde's seasonal verdant appearance, in contrast to the undulating yellow dunes to the north. 
The peninsula is shaped like a triangle (about [tpl]convert|9|miles|km[/tpl] per side), with the base of the triangle roughly along the north and its apex on the south, near Dakar. Near Pointe des Almadies, the north-western tip of the cape, lies Dakar's international airport, famous as a transatlantic ferrying point during World War II. Twin volcanic cones, the Deux Mamelles ("Two Teats"), dominate the landscape along the coast northwest of Dakar. The peninsula embraces a bay and a natural harbour in the southwest.
The indigenous inhabitants of the peninsula, the Lebou, lived as fishermen and farmers. Since about 1444, when the Portuguese first sighted the cape, it has been an entrepôt for African-European trade. The French later established the city of Dakar on the cape in 1857.

[[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]]

CATEGORIES: Theorems about prime numbers, Zeta and L-functions

In number theory, Dirichlet's theorem, also called the Dirichlet prime number theorem, states that for any two positive coprime integers a and d, there are infinitely many primes of the form a + nd, where n is a non-negative integer. In other words, there are infinitely many primes which are congruent to a modulo d. The numbers of the form a + nd form an arithmetic progression
and Dirichlet's theorem states that this sequence contains infinitely many prime numbers. The theorem extends Euclid's theorem that there are infinitely many prime numbers.  Stronger forms of Dirichlet's theorem state that for any such arithmetic progression, the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers in the progression diverges and that different such arithmetic progressions with the same modulus have approximately the same proportions of primes. Equivalently, the primes are evenly distributed (asymptotically) among the congruence classes modulo d containing a's coprime to d.
Dirichlet's theorem does not require that the sequence contains only prime numbers and deals with infinite sequences. For finite sequences, there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes, a theorem known as the Green–Tao theorem.

[[Egg decorating]]

CATEGORIES: Spring traditions, Eggs in culture

Egg decorating is the art or craft of decorating eggs. It is quite a popular art/craft form because of the attractive, smooth, oval shape of the egg. Any bird egg can be facilitated in this process, but most often the larger and stronger the eggshell is, the more favoured it will be by decorators.
Goose, duck and hens' eggs are usually "blown" - a hole is made in either end and the contents are blown out. The egg is then either carved, dyed, painted, appliqued or otherwise decorated (using a number of different techniques).  Egg decoration is particularly popular in Eastern European countries.
Some eggs, like emu or ostrich eggs, are so large and strong that the shells may be carved without breaking. Decorations on emu eggs take advantage of the contrast in colours between the dark green mottled outside of the shell and the shell-underlay. The oldest eggshells, decorated with engraved hatched patterns, are dated for 60 000 years ago and were found at Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C.

Proceedings of the National Acadademy of Science U S A. [tpl]doi|10.1073/pnas.0913047107[/tpl]  PMID 20194764
The renowned Russian artist and jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé made exquisitely decorated precious metal and gemstone eggs for the Russian Court. These Fabergé eggs resembled standard decorated eggs, but they were made from gold and precious stones.
The Persian culture also has a tradition of egg decorating, which takes place during the spring equinox.  This time marks the Persian New Year, and is referred to as Nowruz.  Family members decorate eggs together and place them in a bowl. It is said that it is from this cultural tradition that the Christian practice originates.Easter - Egg Decorating and Dyeing
In Egypt, it is a tradition to decorate boiled eggs during Sham el-Nessim, a spring-ushering national holiday celebrated by Egyptians regardless of religion, which falls every year after the Eastern Christian Easter.
Although Orthodox Christian societies sometimes richly decorate their eggs at Easter, like the Ukrainian ones as shown, it is more normal to dye eggs red all over (perhaps using Cochineal).
Many modern egg artists decorate their "art eggs" by etching or carving, while others paint or cover their eggs with different materials, from paper and fabric to polymer clay and are often painted in bright, spring colours.http://www.urbanara.co.uk/246-easter Using eggs as a canvas has become so popular that special terms have developed with the art form. Egg artists also have their own guild, the International Egg Art Guild, which promotes the craft of egg artistry.
In the USA there are shows in many states where artists show their eggs and vendors of "egging" supplies can be found. Each year, the White House chooses a decorated egg from each state to display at easter.
A special type of egg decoration is egg shoeing, which requires goose eggs and miniature horse-shoes, made of iron or lead. The current world record of egg shoeing is 1119 shoes on a single ostrich egg.Home page of the world recorder, József Koszpek

The Lebou (Lébou) are an ethnic group of Senegal, West Africa, living on the peninsula of Cap-Vert.  The Lebou are primarily a fishing community, but they have a substantial business in construction supplies.  They speak Wolof. Their political and spiritual capital is at layenne, situated in the Yoff neighborhood of northern Dakar.  They have a religious sect and theocracy, the Layene, headquartered there.
The traditional date of the founding of Yoff is 1430. Although they were conquered by the Kingdoms of Jolof (Diolof) and Cayor, and later the French in the 19th century, and were incorporated into modern Senegal, since 1815 they have had a special legal autonomy as a special kind of "theocratic republic".
Lebou society emphasizes piety and respect for elders. Lebou families include not only living people but also associated ancestral spirits.  The Lebou are noted for their public exorcism dances and rituals, often attended by tourists.
In addition to Yoff, other Lebou centres are nearby Ouakam, Cambérène and Ngor.

[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)]]
CATEGORIES: Style (fiction), Narrative techniques

Stream of consciousness is a narrative device used in literature "to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind. Another phrase for it is 'interior monologue'."J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books,1984), p.660-1). The term "Stream of Consciousness" was coined by philosopher and psychologist William James in  The Principles of Psychology (1890):
In literary criticism, stream of consciousness is a narrative mode that seeks to portray an individual's point of view by giving the written equivalent of the character's thought processes, either in a loose interior monologue (see below), or in connection to his or her actions. Stream-of-consciousness writing is usually regarded as a special form of interior monologue and is characterized by associative leaps in thought and lack of punctuation. Stream of consciousness and interior monologue are distinguished from dramatic monologue and soliloquy, where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person, which are chiefly used in poetry or drama. In stream of consciousness the speaker's thought processes are more often depicted as overheard in the mind (or addressed to oneself); it is primarily a fictional device.

[[The Prince]]

The Prince ([tpl]lang-it|Il Principe[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-it|il ˈprin.tʃi.pe|[/tpl]) is a 16th-century political treatise by the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli. From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, De Principatibus (About Principalities). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of the Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings".[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990[/tpl] page 14.
Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative. This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante's Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/06.html |title=Italian Vernacular Literature |work=Vlib.iue.it |accessdate=2012-01-09[/tpl][tpl]Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938[/tpl] emphasizes similarities between the Prince and its forerunners, but still sees the same innovations as other commentators.
The Prince is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. It was also in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time concerning how to consider politics and ethics.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990[/tpl] Although Machiavelli makes many references to classical sources, these do not include the customary deference to Aristotle which was to some extent approved by the church in his time. [tpl]Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=222[/tpl] says that "Machiavelli indicates his fundamental disagreement with Aristotle's doctrine of the whole by substituting "chance" (caso) for "nature" in the only context in which he speaks of "the beginning of the world." Strauss gives evidence that Machiavelli was knowingly influenced by Democritus, whose philosophy of nature was, like that of modern science, materialist.
Although it is relatively short, the treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli's works and the one most responsible for bringing the word "Machiavellian" into usage as a pejorative. It also helped make "Old Nick" an English term for the devil, and even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words "politics" and "politician" in western countries.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=241[/tpl] In terms of subject matter it overlaps with the much longer Discourses on Livy, which was written a few years later. In its use of near-contemporary Italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for politics, another lesser-known work by Machiavelli which The Prince has been compared to is the Life of Castruccio Castracani.
The descriptions within The Prince have the general theme of accepting that the aims of princes—such as glory and survival—can justify the use of immoral means to achieve those ends.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1987|p=297[/tpl]: "Machiavelli is the only political thinker whose name has come into common use for designating a kind of politics, which exists and will continue to exist independently of his influence, a politics guided exclusively by considerations of expediency, which uses all means, fair or foul, iron or poison, for achieving its ends – its end being the aggrandizement of one's country or fatherland – but also using the fatherland in the service of the self-aggrandizement of the politician or statesman or one's party."

It focuses on the two titular characters, played respectively by Jason Mewes and Smith.
The film features a large number of cameo appearances by famous actors, actresses, and directors.
The title and logo for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back are direct references to the second-released Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back.
Smith originally intended for it to be the last film set in his View Askewniverse, or to feature Jay and Silent Bob. Five years later, Smith reconsidered and decided to continue the series with Clerks II, resurrecting Jay and Silent Bob in supporting roles. Smith has also decided to make another sequel to Clerks, and as of 2013 is in development.

It is the third and final film in the Qatsi trilogy.
Naqoyqatsi is a Hopi word (more correctly written naqö̀yqatsi) meaning "life as war". In the film's closing credits, Naqoyqatsi is also translated as "civilized violence" and "a life of killing each other".    While Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi examine modern life in industrial countries and the conflict between encroaching industrialization and traditional ways of life, using slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and natural landscapes, about eighty percent of Naqoyqatsi uses archive footage and stock images manipulated and processed digitally on non-linear editing (non-sequential) workstations and intercut with specially-produced computer generated imagery to demonstrate society's transition from a natural environment to a technology-based one. Reggio described the process as "virtual cinema".

It refers to a male pattern of body hair (androgenic hair) and it is therefore primarily of cosmetic and psychological concern. Hirsutism is a medical sign rather than a disease and may be a sign of a more serious medical condition, especially if it develops well after puberty. The amount and location of the hair is measured by a Ferriman-Gallwey score.

With the world's biggest inland harbor[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] and its proximity to Düsseldorf International Airport, Duisburg has become an important venue for commerce and steel production.
Today's city is a result of numerous incorporations of surrounding towns and smaller cities. It is the fifteenth-largest city in Germany and the fifth-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia with 488,218 residents as of the end of 2010. The city is renowned for its steel industry. The last remaining coal mine closed down in the summer of 2009, but Duisburg has never been a coal-mining center to the same extent as other places in the Ruhr region. All blast furnaces in the Ruhr are now located in Duisburg. 49% of all hot metal and 34.4% of all pig-iron in Germany is produced here (as of 2000). It also has a large brewery, the König Brauerei, located in Duisburg-Beeck, which makes the König Pilsener brand.

John Crome (December 22, 1768 – April 22, 1821) was an English landscape artist of the Romantic era, one of the principal artists of the Norwich School art movement. He is also known as Old Crome to distinguish him from his son, John Berney Crome, who was also a well-known artist.
Crome became the founder of the Norwich School of painters, of which John Sell Cotman is another famous member. He worked in watercolour and oil. His oil paintings number in excess of 300. Many can be seen at major galleries around the world, including the Tate Gallery and the Royal Academy, but he is well represented in Norwich at the Castle Museum and Art Gallery.http://www.culturalmodes.norfolk.gov.uk/projects/nmaspub5.asp?page=hitlist&mwsquery=+%28+{Who%3F}+%3D*+{Crome,%20John}+%29+&filename=d%3A\museums\modes\p_finea1.mdf&submitButton=Show+hits He produced etchings and taught art.

Chamonix-Mont-Blanc,[tpl]IPA-fr|ʃamɔnimɔ̃blɑ̃[/tpl]. more commonly known simply as Chamonix,[tpl]IPA-fr|ʃamɔni[/tpl]. is a commune in the Haute-Savoie département in the Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France. It was the site of the first Winter Olympics in 1924. The commune's population of around 9,800 ranks 865th within the country of France.Sources des données : INSEE – Chamonix: Données générales
Situated near the massive peaks of the Aiguilles Rouges and most notably the Aiguille du Midi, Chamonix is one of the oldest ski resorts in France and is known as the "gateway to the European Cascades." The north side of the summit of Mont Blanc, and therefore the summit itself are part of the village of Chamonix. To the south side, the situation is different depending on the country. Italy considers that the border passes through the top. France considers that the boundary runs along the rocky Tournette under the summit cap, placing it entirely in French territory. The south side was in France, assigned to the commune of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains sharing the summit with its neighbor Chamonix. It is this situation "for France," which is found on the French IGN maps. The Chamonix commune is well known and loved by skiers and mountain enthusiasts of all types, and via the cable car lift to the Aiguille du Midi it is possible to access the world famous off-piste skirun of the Vallée Blanche. With an area of [tpl]convert|245|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], Chamonix is the fourth largest commune in mainland France.

[[The Matchmaker]]

CATEGORIES: 1955 plays, Broadway plays, Plays by Thornton Wilder, Plays based on other plays, Plays adapted into films, Culture of Yonkers, New York

The Matchmaker is a play by Thornton Wilder.
The play has a long and colorful history. John Oxenford's 1835 one-act farce A Day Well Spent had been extended into a full-length play entitled Einen Jux will er sich machen by Austrian playwright Johann Nestroy in 1842. In 1938, Wilder adapted Nestroy's version into an Americanized comedy entitled The Merchant of Yonkers, which attracted the attention of German director Max Reinhardt, who mounted a Broadway production.  It was a dismal failure, running for a mere 39 performances.
Fifteen years later, director Tyrone Guthrie expressed interest in a new production of the play, which Wilder extensively rewrote and rechristened The Matchmaker. The most significant change was the expansion of a previously minor character named Dolly Gallagher Levi, who became the play's centerpiece. A widow who brokers marriages and other transactions in Yonkers, New York at the turn of the 20th century, she sets her sights on local merchant Horace Vandergelder, who has hired her to find him a wife. After a series of slapstick situations involving mistaken identities, secret rendezvous behind carefully placed screens, separated lovers, and a trip to night court, everyone finds themselves paired with a perfect match.
The play was a success at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland and at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London's West End before finally opening on Broadway on December 5, 1955 at the Royale Theatre, later transferring to the Booth to complete its run of 486 performances. Ruth Gordon's performance in the title role earned her a Tony Award nomination as Best Actress; Guthrie won as Best Director.
The 1958 film version, adapted by John Michael Hayes and directed by Joseph Anthony, starred Shirley Booth (Come Back, Little Sheba) as Dolly, Anthony Perkins (Psycho) as Cornelius, Shirley MacLaine (Terms of Endearment) as Irene, Paul Ford (The Music Man) as Vandergelder, and Robert Morse reprising his Broadway role as Barnaby.
In 1964, the play enjoyed yet another incarnation when David Merrick, who had produced the 1955 Broadway production, mounted a hugely successful, Tony Award-winning musical version entitled Hello, Dolly!, with a score by Jerry Herman and starring Carol Channing.
A film version of Hello, Dolly! was released in 1969 starring Barbra Streisand in the lead role.
The 1981 Tom Stoppard farce On the Razzle is also based on the same story.

Georgetown University is a private research university in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1789, it is the oldest Jesuit and Catholic university in the United States. Georgetown's main campus, located in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood, is noted for Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark in the Romanesque revival style. Georgetown operates a law center on Capitol Hill and auxiliary campuses in Italy, Turkey, and Qatar.
Georgetown's founding by John Carroll, America's first Catholic bishop, realized earlier efforts to establish a Roman Catholic college in the province of Maryland that had been thwarted by religious persecution. The university expanded after the American Civil War under the leadership of Patrick Francis Healy, who came to be known as Georgetown's "second founder" despite having been born a slave by law. Jesuits have participated in the university's administration since 1805, a heritage Georgetown celebrates, but the university has always been governed independently of the Society of Jesus and of church authorities.
The university has around 7,000 undergraduate and over 8,000 post-graduate students from a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, including 130 foreign countries.[tpl]cite web |url= http://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/georgetown-university |title= College Search - Georgetown University |work= College Board |year= 2012 |accessdate= December 9, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://oip.georgetown.edu/internationals/ |title= International Students, Faculty, and Researchers |publisher= Georgetown University |work= Office of International Programs |year= 2012 |accessdate= December 9, 2012[/tpl] The university's most notable alumni are prominent in public life in the United States and abroad. Among them are former U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, dozens of U.S. governors and members of Congress, heads of state or government of more than a dozen countries, royalty and diplomats.
Campus organizations include the country's largest student-run business and largest student-run banking option. Georgetown's athletic teams, called the Hoyas, include a men's basketball team that has won a record-tying seven Big East championships, appeared in five Final Fours, and won a national championship in 1984.

Celluloid is easily molded and shaped, and it was first widely used as an ivory replacement. The main purpose was movie and photography film industries, that used only celluloid films prior to acetate films that were introduced in the fifties. Celluloid is highly flammable, difficult and expensive to produce and is no longer widely used. Its most common uses today are in table tennis balls, musical instruments and guitar picks.http://www.dandreapicks.com/about.htm Andrea Picks: The Saga of Cellulose

Anne Hathaway's Cottage is a twelve-roomed farmhouse where  Anne Hathaway, the wife of William Shakespeare, lived as a child in the village of Shottery, Warwickshire, England, about [tpl]convert|1|mi[/tpl] west of Stratford-upon-Avon. Spacious, and with several bedrooms, it is now set in extensive gardens.
The earliest part of the house was built prior to the 15th century. The cottage was known as Newlands Farm in Shakespeare's day and had more than [tpl]convert|90|acre|ha|abbr=off[/tpl] of land attached to it. As in many houses of the period, it has multiple chimneys to spread the heat evenly throughout the house during winter. The largest chimney was used for cooking. It also has visible timber framing, typical of vernacular Tudor style architecture. 
After the death of Hathaway's father, the cottage was owned by her brother Bartholomew, and was passed down the Hathaway family until 1846, when financial problems forced them to sell it. However, it was still occupied by them as tenants when it was acquired in 1892 by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which removed later additions and alterations. In 1969 the cottage was badly damaged in a fire, but was restored by the Trust.Shakespeare Birthplace Trust: Anne Hathaway's Cottage It is now open to public visitors as a museum.

[[Diophantine set]]

CATEGORIES: Diophantine equations, Hilbert's problems

In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is an equation of the form P(x1, ..., xj, y1, ..., yk)=0 (usually abbreviated P([tpl]overline|x[/tpl],[tpl]overline|y[/tpl])=0 ) where P([tpl]overline|x[/tpl],[tpl]overline|y[/tpl]) is a polynomial  with integer coefficients.  A Diophantine set is a subset S of Nj  Planet Math Definition so that for some Diophantine equation P([tpl]overline|x[/tpl],[tpl]overline|y[/tpl])=0.
 The MRDP theorem states that a set of integers is Diophantine if and only if it is computably enumerable.The final piece of this result was published in 1970 by Matiyasevich and is thus also known as Matiyasevich's theorem but pedantically speaking Matiyasevich's theorem refers to the representability of exponentiation in Diophantine sets and the mathematical community has moved to calling the equivalence result the MRDP theorem or the Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich theorem after the mathematicians providing key pieces of the theorem. A set of integers S is recursively enumerable if and only if there is an algorithm that, when given an integer, halts if that integer is a member of S and runs forever otherwise. This means that the concept of general Diophantine set, apparently belonging to number theory, can be taken rather in logical or recursion-theoretic terms. This is far from obvious, however, and represented the culmination of some decades of work.
Matiyasevich's completion of the MRDP theorem settled Hilbert's tenth problem. Hilbert's tenth problemDavid Hilbert posed the problem in his celebrated list, from his 1900 address to the International Congress of Mathematicians. was to find a general algorithm which can decide whether a given Diophantine equation has a solution among the integers.  While Hilbert's tenth problem is not a formal mathematical statement as such the nearly universal acceptance of the (philosophical) identification of a decision algorithm with a total computable predicate allows us to use the MRDP theorem to conclude the tenth problem is unsolvable.

Each issue featured a variety of self-contained, pre-scripted, play-tested game scenarios, often called "modules" (commonly referred to as "adventures" or "scenarios"). Dungeon Masters (DMs) could either enact these adventures with their respective player groups as written or adapt them to their own campaign settings. By providing a full complement of ideas, hooks, plots, adversaries, creatures, illustrations, maps, hand-outs, and character dialogue, Dungeon aimed to save DMs time and effort in preparing game sessions for their players. As a resource containing several modules per issue, it was significantly cheaper than standard-format modules.

Kocheril Raman Narayanan ([tpl]audio|Krn.ogg|listen[/tpl]; 27 October 1920 – 9 November 2005) was the tenth President of India.
Born in Perumthanam, Uzhavoor village, in the princely state of Travancore (present day Kottayam district, Kerala), and after a brief stint with journalism and then studying political science at the London School of Economics with the assistance of a scholarship, Narayanan began his career in India as a member of the Indian Foreign Service in the Nehru administration. He served as ambassador to Japan, United Kingdom, Thailand, Turkey, People's Republic of China and United States of America and was referred to by Nehru as "the best diplomat of the country".Manmohan Singh: Condolence message. Retrieved 24 February 2006. He entered politics at Indira Gandhi's request and won three successive general elections to the Lok Sabha and served as a Minister of State in the Union Cabinet under former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Elected as the ninth Vice President in 1992, Narayanan went on to become President in 1997. He was the first - and, so far, only - member of the Dalit community, to hold the post.
Narayanan is regarded as an independent and assertive President who set several precedents and enlarged the scope of the highest constitutional office. He described himself as a "working President" who worked "within the four corners of the Constitution"; something midway between an "executive President" who has direct power and a "rubber-stamp President" who endorses government decisions without question or deliberation.Interview with K. R. Narayanan on Independence day, 15 August 1998; by N. Ram, Editor, Frontline R. Narayanan in conversation with N. Ram", The Hindu, 10 November 2005. Retrieved 24 February 2006. He used his discretionary powers as a President and deviated from convention and precedent in many situations, including –  but not limited to – the  appointment of the Prime Minister in a hung Parliament, in dismissing a state government and imposing President's rule there at the suggestion of the Union Cabinet, and during the Kargil conflict. He  presided over the golden jubilee celebrations of Indian independence and in the country's general election of 1998 became the first Indian President to vote when in office, setting another new precedent.

The international metropolitan region was estimated to be just over five million in 2009 and approximately 5,105,769 in 2010,[tpl]cite web|url=http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-223&srt=pnan&col=aohdq&pt=a&va=&geo=-1049427|title=World Gazetteer – San Diego-Tijuana|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071001005330/http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-223&srt=pnan&col=aohdq&pt=a&va=&geo=-1049427|archivedate=2007-10-01[/tpl] making it the third largest metropolitan area in the Californias, 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas,[tpl]cite web|url=http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-2&srt=pnan&col=aohdq&va=&pt=a|title=World Gazetteer – Metropolitan Areas of America|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930223100/http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-2&srt=pnan&col=aohdq&va=&pt=a|archivedate=2007-09-30[/tpl] and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico.  Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego; during the 2000s the drug violence had residents moving out of the congested urban core into isolated communities within the municipality and beyond, as evidenced by 2010 Census figures and growth patterns.
Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. As the American conquest of northern Mexico ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijuana's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was founded in July 11, 1889 as urban development began. Often known by its initials, "T.J.", and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico, the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s.

[[Double-entry bookkeeping system]]
CATEGORIES: Accounting systems, Italian inventions, Accounting terminology

Double-entry bookkeeping,  in accounting, is a system of bookkeeping so named because every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. For instance, recording earnings of $100 would require making two entries: a debit entry of $100 to an account called "Cash" and a credit entry to an account called "Income."
The earliest known written description of double-entry accounting comes from Franciscan friar Luca Pacioli.[tpl]cite book|last=Gleeson-White|first=Jane|title=Double Entry: How the Merchants of Venice Created Modern Finance|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=0393088960[/tpl] In deciding which account has to be debited and which account has to be credited, the golden rules of accounting are used. This is also accomplished using the accounting equation: Equity = Assets − Liabilities. The accounting equation serves as an error detection tool. If at any point the sum of debits for all accounts does not equal the corresponding sum of credits for all accounts, an error has occurred. It follows that the sum of debits and the sum of the credits must be equal in value.
Double-entry bookkeeping is not a guarantee that no errors have been made—for example, the wrong ledger account may have been debited or credited, or the entries completely reversed.

Lake Gairdner is a national park in South Australia (Australia), 436 km northwest of Adelaide. It is located just south of the Trans Australian Railway line, Stuart Highway, and the Woomera Prohibited area.
There is very limited public access to this park which is surrounded by pastoral leases. The easiest public access is from the main road running from Yardea to Kingoonya, at The Brothers Well, a concrete catchment at the side of the road at the Southern end of Moonarie station (though the road signs would have you believe that you were on Yardea Station). The road is dirt, but quite good enough for two-wheel drive vehicles unless it is wet, when it is likely that it will be closed by the Highways Dept..
Ordinarily, the country is totally arid, and devoid of free water, surface or underground. In the summer it can be extremely hot: in the springtime, though, this country has great attraction for birdwatchers and botanists.
This region is the home country of the Kokatha people, and traces of their occupation may still be found: sacred sites are still visited for ceremonies.

The Southwest National Park is a [tpl]convert|618,267|ha|acre|adj=on[/tpl] national park located in the south-west of Tasmania, Australia.  The park is Tasmania's largest and forms part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=3801|title=Southwest National Park-Introduction|accessdate=2009-10-14[/tpl]
The eastern boundary is [tpl]convert|93|km|mi[/tpl] west of Hobart and the park stretches to the west and south coasts. This park comprises the bulk of Tasmania's South West Wilderness.
The park is well known for its pristine wilderness and remoteness.  Weather in the park is highly changeable, and can be severe. The area is largely unaffected by humans. Although evidence shows Tasmanian Aborigines have visited the area for at least 25,000 years, and European settlers have made occasional forays into the park area since the 19th century, there has been very little permanent habitation and only minimal impact on the natural environment. Within the area there is only one road, to the hydroelectricity township of Strathgordon. The southern and western reaches of the park are far removed from any vehicular access. The only access is by foot, boat, or light aircraft.
The tiny locality of Melaleuca in the extreme south-west provides an airstrip and some very basic facilities, mainly to service the National Parks Service.

Located in the Tasmanian Central Highlands east of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, and west of the Central Plateau Conservation Area.  It is south of Mole Creek, Tasmania, and Rowallan Lake. 
It forms part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.
The park takes its name from the geological features of the park which are thought to resemble the walls of the city of Jerusalem. As a result many places and features within the park also have Biblical references for names, such as Herods Gate, Lake Salome, Solomons Jewels, Damascus Gate, the Pool of Bethesda.
The most prominent feature of the park is King Davids Peak.
Much of the walking track consists of raised boards, from Wild Dog Creek through to Dixon's Kingdom, with the purpose of protecting the fragile alpine vegetation. Walking tracks elsewhere in the park consist of rock, rocky earth, grassland and marsh.

[[Video game publisher]]

CATEGORIES: Video game development, Video game publishers

A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by a video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising.
They often finance the development, sometimes by paying a video game developer (the publisher calls this external development) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio. The large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish, while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute the games they publish. Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any license that the game may utilize; paying for localization; layout, printing, and possibly the writing of the user manual; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design.
Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality.
Because the publisher often finances development, it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer, critique ongoing development, and assist as necessary. Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties. These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development, called milestones.

The Family Man is a 2000 American romantic comedy film directed by Brett Ratner and starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. Cage's production company, Saturn Films, helped produce the film.[ref]
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218967/
[/ref]
The film centers on a man, who sees what could have been had he made a different decision 13 years prior. It is similar to It's a Wonderful Life in that it begins on Christmas Eve with a life-and-death situation, involving a supernatural being (posing as a gunman), who tries to convince the main character into taking an earnest look at his life. Moreover, in the end, the protagonists in both movies conclude that living a quiet family life is preferable to achieving success and wealth at work.
The film has also been compared to Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol in that the protagonist is a greedy man who cares little about anyone except himself and then has his life outlook completely changed after a series of real-life "what if?" experiences.

[[Alberti bass]]

CATEGORIES: Accompaniment, Piano

Alberti bass is a particular kind of accompaniment figure in music, often used in the Classical era, and sometimes  the Romantic era. It was named after Domenico Alberti (1710–1740), who used it extensively, although he was not the first to use it."Alberti Bass." Baker's Student Encyclopedia of Music. Ed. Laura Kuhn. Schirmer-Thomson Gale, 1999.
Alberti bass is a kind of broken chord or arpeggiated accompaniment, where the notes of the chord are presented in the order lowest, highest, middle, highest. This pattern is then repeated. The broken chord pattern helps to create a smooth, sustained, flowing sound on the piano.
Alberti bass is usually found in the left hand of pieces for keyboard instruments, especially for Mozart's piano pieces. However, it is also found in pieces for other instruments. 
Well-known examples of Alberti bass include the beginning of Mozart's Piano Sonata, K 545.[tpl]cite book|last=Rink|first=John|title=Musical performance: a guide to understanding|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984[/tpl]  A famous example from 20th-century American popular music is the rhythm guitar part of the 1962 "surf rock" standard Pipeline (instrumental), by The Chantays.

[[Accretion disc]]

CATEGORIES: Binary stars, Black holes, Unsolved problems in physics, Vortices

An accretion disc is a structure (often a circumstellar disk) formed by diffuse material in orbital motion around a massive central body. The central body is typically a star. Gravity causes material in the disc to spiral inward towards the central body. Gravitational and frictional forces compress and raise the temperature of the material causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object's mass. Accretion discs of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared; those around neutron stars and black holes in the X-ray part of the spectrum. The study of oscillation modes in accretion discs is referred to as diskoseismology.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1086/170465 | last = Nowak | first = Michael A. |author2= Wagoner, Robert V. | title = Diskoseismology: Probing accretion disks.

Located in East Gippsland, the park reserves examples of warm temperate rainforest, particularly the jungle of Mount Drummer. Compared to the tropical rainforests of Queensland and New South Wales, this is a floristically depauperate forest, representing as it does the southern limit of this flora. This region is biogeographically interesting as the meeting point between the subtropical flora of the north of Australia and the cool temperate and arid zone floras of the south and west. The rainforest community consists of a closed canopy of Lilly Pilly Acmena smithii with numerous lianas, ferns and epiphytes. The park is particularly known for occurrence of four varieties of tree ferns and of epiphytic orchids such as the orange-blossom orchid Sarcochilus falcatus and the rock orchid Dendrobium speciosum. The park was burnt quite badly in the 1983 'Ash Wednesday' bushfires.

In mathematics, a degenerate distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable which only takes a single value.  Examples include a two-headed coin and rolling a die whose sides all show the same number. While this distribution does not appear random in the everyday sense of the word, it does satisfy the definition of random variable.
The degenerate distribution is localized at a point k0 on the real line. The probability mass function is given by:

The Canadian dollar (symbol: $; code: CAD) is the currency of Canada. It is abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or C$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.There are various common abbreviations to distinguish the Canadian dollar from others: while the ISO currency code CAD (a three-character code without monetary symbols) is common, no single system is universally accepted.  C$ is recommended by the Canadian government (and The Canadian Style guide) and is used by the International Monetary Fund, while Editing Canadian English indicates Can$ and CDN$; both guides note the ISO scheme/code. The abbreviation CA$ is also used such as in some software packages. It is divided into 100 cents.
Owing to the image of a loon on the one-dollar coin, the currency is sometimes referred to as the loonie (though this term is often reserved only for the coin itself, see Loonie).

The ALOHAnet used a new method of medium access (ALOHA random access) and experimental ultra high frequency (UHF) for its operation, since frequency assignments for communications to and from a computer were not available for commercial applications in the 1970s.  But even before such frequencies were assigned there were two other media available for the application of an ALOHA channel – cables and satellites.  In the 1970s ALOHA random access was employed in the widely used Ethernet cable based network[tpl]cite journal | title = Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks | journal = Comm. of the ACM | date = July 1976 | last = Robert M.

In the early 1980s frequencies for mobile networks became available, and in 1985 frequencies suitable for what became known as Wi-Fi were allocated in the US.  These regulatory developments made it possible to use the ALOHA random-access techniques in both Wi-Fi and in mobile telephone networks.

In the early 2000s additional ALOHA channels were added to 2.5G and 3G mobile phones with the widespread introduction of GPRS, using a slotted-ALOHA random-access channel combined with a version of the Reservation ALOHA scheme first analyzed by a group at BBN.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Will Crowther | contribution = A System for Broadcast Communication: Reservation-ALOHA | title = Proceedings of the 6th Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences | place = Honolulu | pages = 371–374 | date = January 1973| id =  | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | author2 =  | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]

[[Linear independence]]
CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra, Linear algebra, Articles containing proofs

In linear algebra, two slightly different notions of linear independence are used: the linear independence of a family of vectors, and the linear independence of a set of vectors.
Both notions are important and used in common, and sometimes even confused in the literature.
Here the first three vectors are linearly independent; but the fourth vector equals 9 times the first plus 5 times the second plus 4 times the third, so the four vectors together are linearly dependent. Linear dependence is a property of the family, not of any particular vector; for example in this case we could just as well write the first vector as a linear combination of the last three.
In probability theory and statistics there is an unrelated measure of linear dependence between random variables.

Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ([tpl]lang-ar|عبد الملك بن مروان[/tpl] ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwān), (646 – 8 October 705) was the 5th Umayyad Caliph. He was born in Medina, Hejaz.There is uncertainty as to when his actual birth occurred. Sources sau 646 or 647. `Abd al-Malik was a well-educated man and capable ruler, despite the many political problems that impeded his rule. 14th century Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun states: "`Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan is one of the greatest Arab and Muslim Caliphs. He followed in the footsteps of `Umar ibn al-Khattab, the Commander of the Believers, in regulating state affairs".
In his reign, all important records were translated into Arabic, and for the first time a special currency for the Muslim world was minted, which led to war with the Byzantine Empire under Justinian II. The Byzantines were led by Leontios at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692 in Asia Minor and were decisively defeated by the Caliph after the defection of a large contingent of Slavs. The Islamic currency was then made the only currency exchange in the Muslim world. Also, many reforms happened in his time as regards agriculture and commerce. `Abd al-Malik consolidated Muslim rule and extended it, made Arabic the state language, and organized a regular postal service.Classical Islam G.Gunebam

[[Halloween costume]]
CATEGORIES: Halloween practices

Halloween costumes are costumes worn on or around Halloween, a festival which falls on October 31. An early reference to wearing costumes at Halloween comes from Scotland in 1585, but they may pre-date this. There are many references to the custom during the 18th and 19th centuries in the Celtic countries of Scotland, Ireland, Mann and Wales. It has been suggested that the custom comes from the Celtic festival of Samhain/Calan Gaeaf, or from the practise of 'souling' at Hallowmas. Wearing costumes and mumming has long been associated with festivals at other times of the year, such as on Christmas."Halloween," 2008, p. 63-64. Halloween costumes are traditionally based on frightening supernatural or folkloric beings. However, by the 1930s costumes based on characters in mass media such as film, literature, and radio were popular. Halloween costumes have tended to be worn mainly by young people, but since the mid-20th century they have been increasingly worn by adults also.

Dolley Payne Todd Madison (May 20, 1768 – July 12, 1849) was the wife of James Madison, President of the United States from 1809 to 1817. She was noted for her social gifts, which boosted her husband’s popularity as President. In this way, she did much to define the role of the President’s spouse, known only much later by the title First Lady—a function she had sometimes performed earlier for the widowed Jefferson.Catherine Allgor, A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation (New York: Henry Holy & Co., 2006), 43
Dolley Madison also helped to furnish the newly constructed White House. When the British set fire to it in 1814, she was credited with saving the classic portrait of George Washington.
In widowhood, she often lived in poverty, partially relieved by the sale of her late husband’s papers.

Deliverance is a 1972 American dramatic thriller film produced and directed by John Boorman and starring Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox, with both Beatty and Cox making their feature film debuts. The film is based on the 1970 novel of the same name by American author James Dickey, who has a small role in the film as the Sheriff. The screenplay was written by Dickey and an uncredited Boorman.
Widely acclaimed as a landmark picture, the film is noted both for the memorable music scene near the beginning, with one of the city men duelling on guitar with a strange country boy playing banjo, that sets the tone for what lies ahead—a trip into unknown and potentially dangerous territory—and for its notorious "squeal like a pig" male rape scene. In 2008, Deliverance was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

[[Musical instrument classification]]

CATEGORIES: Organology

At various times, and in various cultures, various schemes of musical instrument classification have been used.
The most commonly used system in use in the west today divides instruments into string instruments, woodwind instruments, brass instruments and percussion instruments. However other ones have been devised, and some cultures also use different schemes.
The oldest known scheme of classifying instruments is Chinese and dates from the 3rd millennium BC.[tpl]citation needed|reason=How is that date possible when the earliest Chinese writing dates back to the second half of the 2nd millenium BC?|date=May 2013[/tpl] It groups instruments according to what they are made out of. All instruments made out of stone are in one group, all those made out of wood in another, those made out of silk are in a third, and all those made of bamboo in the 4th, as recorded in the Yo Chi (record of ritual music and dance), compiled from sources of the Chou period (9th-5th centuries BC), and corresponding to the 4 seasons and 4 winds (Kartomi, 1990).
The 8-fold system of pa yin ("8 sounds"), from the same source, occurred gradually, and in the legendary Emperor Shun's time (3rd millennium BC) it is believed to have been presented  in the following order:   metal (chin), stone (shih),  silk (ssu), bamboo (chu), gourd (p'ao), clay (t'u), leather (ko), and wood (mu)  classes, and it correlated to the 8 seasons and 8 winds of Chinese culture, autumn and west, autumn-winter and NW, summer and south, spring and east, winter-spring and NE, summer-autumn and SW, winter and north, and spring-summer and SE, respectively (Kartomi, 1990). 
However, the Chou-Li (Programs of Chou), an anonymous treatise compiled from earlier sources in about the 2nd century BC, had the following order: metal, stone, clay, leather, silk, wood, gourd, and bamboo. The same order was presented in the Tso Chuan (Tso Commentary), attributed to Tso Chiu-Ming, probably compiled in the 4th century BC (Kartomi, 1990).
Much later, Ming dynasty (1300s-1600) scholar Chu Tsai Yu recognized 3 groups: those instruments using muscle power or used for musical accompaniment, those that are blown, and those that are rhythmic, a scheme which was probably the 1st of scholarly type, the other earlier ones being traditional, folk taxonomies. (Margaret  Kartomi, 2011, Upward and Downward Classifications of Musical Instruments-musicology.ff,cuni.cz)
More usually, instruments are classified according to how the sound is initially produced (regardless of post-processing, i.e. an electric guitar is still a string-instrument regardless of what analog or digital/computational post-processing effects pedals may be used with it).

A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument.  For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism.

CATEGORIES: Newbery Medal winning works, American children's novels, American novels adapted into films, Harper & Row books, 1969 novels

Sounder is a young adult novel by William H. Armstrong. It is the story of an African-American boy living with his sharecropper family. Although the family's difficulties increase when the father is imprisoned for stealing a ham from work, the boy still hungers for an education. 
"Sounder", the dog's name, is the only character name used in the book. The author refers to the various characters by their relationship or their role in the story. The setting is also ambiguous. The author notes prisoners were hauled in "mule-drawn wagons", and the mention of chain gangs places an upper limit to the story of 1955 when the practice ended.  The boy hears his father may be in Bartow and later Gilmer counties but the author does not specify where the boy lives. Since the boy is assured his father wouldn't be taken out of state, and because the ground freezes, we are left to assume the family lives in the counties around northern Georgia or northwestern South Carolina.
Sounder won the Newbery Award in 1970, and was made into a major motion picture in 1972.

A gamelan is a traditional musical ensemble from Indonesia, typically from the islands of Java and Bali, featuring a variety of instruments such as metallophones, xylophones, kendang (drums) and gongs; bamboo flutes, bowed and plucked strings. Vocalists may also be included. For most Indonesians, gamelan music is an integral part of Indonesian culture.Bramantyo Prijosusilo, 'Indonesia needs the Harmony of the Gamelan', The Jakarta Globe, 22 February 2011.
The term refers more to the set of instruments than to the players of those instruments. A gamelan is a set of instruments as a distinct entity, built and tuned to stay together – instruments from different gamelan are generally not interchangeable.

Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers ([tpl]lang-en|Encyclopaedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts[/tpl]) was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759, co-edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert. As of 1750, the full title was Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres, mis en ordre par M. Diderot de l'Académie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Prusse, et quant à la partie mathématique, par M. d'Alembert de l'Académie royale des Sciences de Paris, de celle de Prusse et de la Société royale de Londres.

The title page was amended as D'Alembert acquired more titles.
The Encyclopédie was an innovative encyclopedia in several respects. Among other things, it was the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to lavish attention on the mechanical arts. Still, the Encyclopédie is famous above all for representing the thought of the Enlightenment. According to Denis Diderot in the article "Encyclopédie", the Encyclopédie's aim was "to change the way people think".Denis Diderot as quoted in Hunt, p. 611 He wanted to incorporate all of the world's knowledge into the Encyclopédie and hoped that the text could disseminate all this information to the public and future generations.Denis Diderot as quoted in Kramnick, p. 17

All the President's Men is a 1974 non-fiction book by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two of the journalists investigating the first Watergate break-in and ensuing scandal for The Washington Post.  The book chronicles the investigative reporting of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward's initial report on the Watergate break-in through the resignations of H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, and the revelation of the Nixon tapes by Alexander Butterfield in 1973. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the Post, naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably Hugh Sloan. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source Deep Throat whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years.In 2005 Deep Throat was revealed to be then-FBI Associate Director W. Mark Felt. Gene Roberts, the former executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and former managing editor of The New York Times, has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein "maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time."Roy J. Harris, Jr., Pulitzer's Gold, 2007, p. 233, Columbia: University of Missouri Press, ISBN 978-0-8262-4.
A film adaptation, produced by Robert Redford and starring Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, was released in 1976.   That same year, a sequel to the book, The Final Days, was published, which chronicled the last months of Nixon's Presidency, starting around the time that their previous book ended.

[[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]

CATEGORIES: Anglo-Dutch Wars, Wars involving the Netherlands, The Patriottentijd, 1780s conflicts

The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780–1784) was a conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic.  The war, tangentially related to the American Revolutionary War, broke out over British and Dutch disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain's enemies in that war.
Although the Dutch Republic did not enter into a formal alliance with the United States and their allies, U.S. ambassador (and future President) John Adams managed to establish diplomatic relations with the Dutch Republic, making it the second European country to diplomatically recognize the Continental Congress in April 1782. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded as well.
Most of the war consisted of a series of largely successful British operations against Dutch colonial economic interests, although British and Dutch naval forces also met once off the Dutch coast.  The war ended disastrously for the Dutch and exposed the weakness of the political and economic foundations of the Republic.[tpl]Harvnb|Edler|2001|p=88[/tpl]

Child labour was employed to varying extents through most of history. Before 1940, numerous children aged 5–14 worked in Europe, the United States and various colonies of European powers. These children worked in agriculture, home-based assembly operations, factories, mining and in services such as newsies. Some worked night shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of household income, availability of schools and passage of child labour laws, the incidence rates of child labour fell.[tpl]cite web|title=Child Labour in Historical Perspective: 1800-1985|publisher=UNICEF|author=Cunningham and Viazzo|isbn=88-85401-27-9|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/hisper_childlabour_low.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The World of Child Labour|author=Hugh Hindman|publisher=M.E.

There are five main types of psoriasis: plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic.[tpl]cite web|title=Psoriasis|url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/dermatology/patient_information/psoriasis.html|author=University of California, Davis, Department of Dermatology|accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl] Plaque psoriasis is the most common form and typically manifests as red and white scaly patches on the top layer of the skin. Skin cells rapidly accumulate at these plaque sites and create a silvery-white appearance. Plaques frequently occur on the skin of the elbows and knees, but can affect any area, including the scalp, palms of hands and soles of feet, and genitals. In contrast to eczema, psoriasis is more likely to be found on the outer side of the joint. Fingernails and toenails are frequently affected (psoriatic nail dystrophy) and can be seen as an isolated sign. Inflammation of the joints in the context of psoriatic disease, known as psoriatic arthritis, affects up to 30% of individuals with psoriasis.
The causes of psoriasis are not fully understood. Psoriasis is not purely a skin disorder and can have a negative impact on many organ systems. Psoriasis has been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease and other immune-mediated disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  It is generally considered a genetic disease thought to be triggered or influenced by environmental factors. Psoriasis develops when the immune system mistakes a normal skin cell for a pathogen, and sends out faulty signals that cause overproduction of new skin cells. It is not contagious.[tpl]cite book|last=Weller|first=Richard|title=Clinical dermatology|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=978-1-4443-0009-3|pages=54–70|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5RHM0Nerk9gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=dermatology#v=onepage&q=psoriasis&f=false|edition=4th|coauthors=John AA Hunter, John Savin, Mark Dahl[/tpl] Oxidative stress,[tpl]cite journal |title=Oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of psoriasis |date=October 2009|author=Zhou Q, Mrowietz U, Rostami-Yazdi M |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=891–905 |pmid=19577640|doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.06.033[/tpl] stress, and withdrawal of a systemic corticosteroid have each been suggested as a trigger for psoriasis.[tpl]cite journal|author=Chong HT, Kopecki Z, Cowin AJ|title=Lifting the silver flakes: the pathogenesis and management of chronic plaque psoriasis|journal=Biomed Res Int|date=August 2013|volume=2013|issue=168321|pmid=24062996|pmc=3766987|doi=10.1155/2013/168321[/tpl]  Injury to the skin can trigger local psoriatic skin changes known as the Koebner phenomenon.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ely JW, Seabury Stone M|title=The generalized rash: part II.

Sixto Escobar (March 23, 1913 – November 17, 1979) was a Puerto Rican professional boxer. Competing in the bantamweight division, he became Puerto Rico's first world champion.
Escobar was born in Barceloneta and raised in San Juan. There he received his primary education and took interest in boxing. After gathering a record of 21-1-1 as an amateur, Escobar debuted as a professional in 1931 defeating Luis "Kid Dominican" Pérez by knockout. Early in his career, he moved to Venezuela due to the lack of opponents in his division. There he received an opportunity for the Venezuelan Bantamweight championship, but lost by points. Subsequently he moved to New York and began boxing in other states, eventually capturing the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title. In 1936, he defeated Tony Marino to unify this championship with the one recognized by the International Boxing Union, in the process becoming the third Latin American undisputed world boxing champion. After retiring, he worked as a spokesperson for beer companies in New York, before returning to Puerto Rico in the 1960s, where he resided until his death. He received several posthumous recognitions and his name was used in several sports venues and buildings. In 2002, Escobar was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

Despite the origin of the name, "ringing" is only one of many sounds the person may perceive.
Tinnitus is not a disease, but a condition that can result from a wide range of underlying causes.

Withdrawal from benzodiazepines may cause tinnitus as well. Tinnitus may be an accompaniment of sensorineural hearing loss or congenital hearing loss, or it may be observed as a side effect of certain medications (ototoxic tinnitus).
Tinnitus is usually a subjective phenomenon, such that it cannot be objectively measured. The condition is often rated clinically on a simple scale from "slight" to "catastrophic" according to the difficulties it imposes, such as interference with sleep, quiet activities, and normal daily activities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.otohns.net/default.asp?id=1030|title=Guidelines for the grading of tinnitus severity |accessdate=2009-12-31 [/tpl]

This, however, has no effect on tinnitus volume level. As of 2013, there are no effective medications. It is common, affecting about 10-15% of people. For many it may be only a temporary condition and can be tolerated well. However, for those for whom it is a permanent condition it can be a significant problem - it is estimated that this applies to 1-2% of people. Nevertheless, psychological treatment (specifically, CBT) can assist with management of the tinnitus and help reduce associated distress.

It is about 35 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, and is supplied by the Ferlo or Bounoum River, which flows north into its southern end, from Fouta in the rainy season.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] Water used to flow out to the Senegal River north through the Portuguese River, but this has been replaced by a straight canal to Richard-Toll.

The shores are mostly fertile.  The north shore and surrounding area have been converted to a large sugar-growing region irrigated with water from the lake.
Lac de Guiers is designated an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International; the key species are Lesser Flamingo Phoeniconaias minor, Glossy Ibis Plegadis falcinellus, Eurasian Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia, African Spoonbill Platalea alba, White-winged Tern Chlidonias leucopterus and River Prinia Prinia fluviatilis.
The lake has a complicated history involving the kingdoms of Tekrur and Waalo and the Empire of Jolof (Diolof).  Notably, the settlement of Nder, the third and final capital of the former Kingdom of Waalo, was located on the west shores of the Lake.  The royal compound or "keur" is still there.

Non sequitur (Latin for "it does not follow"), in formal logic, is an argument in which its conclusion does not follow from its premises.[tpl]cite book |last= Barker|first= Stephen F. |authorlink=Stephen Francis Barker|title= The Elements of Logic|origdate= |origyear= 1965 |format= |edition=Sixth |series= |date= |year= 2003|month= |publisher= McGraw-Hill |location= New York, NY | isbn= 0-07-283235-5|oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 160–169|chapter=Chapter 6: Fallacies [/tpl]  In a non sequitur, the conclusion could be either true or false, but the argument is fallacious because there is a disconnection between the premise and the conclusion.  All invalid arguments are special cases of non sequitur.  The term has special applicability in law, having a formal legal definition. Many types of known non sequitur argument forms have been classified into many different types of logical fallacies.

Baw Baw is a national park in Victoria, Australia, 111 km east of Melbourne. It contains the Baw-Baw Plateau and Mount Baw Baw, a  small ski resort, including nearby town, technically outside the national park.
Geographically, Baw-Baw plateau is a plateau of several peaks (Mount Baw Baw, Mount St Gwinear, Mount St Phillack, Mount Erica and Mount Whitelaw) of largely subalpine terrane outcrops of weathered granite boulders dot the plateau with alpine meadows punctuated by stands of snow-gum.
It is reported that Baw Baw is Aboriginal for 'echo' but the name could also come from 'Bo Bo', a name used on early maps meaning Big.
The area was first explored in 1860 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. The area was settled in the 1880s and 1890s, after the discovery of gold in the area. Baw Baw National Park was declared in April 1979. On 7 November 2008 the park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/australian-alps/index.html |title=Australian Alps National Parks information |accessdate=2010-06-10 |work=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts [/tpl]

Jean-Claude Duvalier, nicknamed "Bébé Doc" or "Baby Doc" (born July 3, 1951) was the President of Haiti from 1971 until his overthrow by a popular uprising in 1986. He succeeded François "Papa Doc" Duvalier, his father, as the ruler of Haiti following the older man's death in 1971. After assuming power, he introduced cosmetic changes to his father's regime and delegated much authority to his advisors, though thousands of Haitians were killed or tortured, and hundreds of thousands fled the country. He maintained a notoriously lavish lifestyle (including a state-sponsored $3 million (USD) wedding in 1980), and made millions from involvement in the drug trade and from selling body parts from dead Haitians while poverty among his people remained the most widespread for any country in the Western Hemisphere.
Relations with the United States improved after Duvalier's ascension to the presidency, and later deteriorated under the Carter administration, only to again improve under Ronald Reagan due to the strong anti-communist stance of the Duvaliers.
Duvalier unexpectedly returned to Haiti on January 16, 2011 after two decades in self-imposed exile in France. The following day, he was arrested by Haitian police, facing possible charges for embezzlement. On January 18, Duvalier was charged with corruption. On February 28, 2013, Duvalier pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption and human rights abuse.

The Brisbane Ranges National Park is a national park in Anakie, Victoria, Australia, 80 km west of Melbourne. The park is the responsibility of Parks Victoria.A complete history of the park from parkweb, a gov. site The park covers part of the Brisbane Ranges, an area of hills of moderate elevation. 
The park features a number of walking tracks, of which the walk through Anakie Gorge is the most popular.Brisbane Ranges Park Notes, Parks Victoria, September 2005 Other attractions include the Ted Errey Nature Circuit and Wadawurrung walk. Relatively flat and suitable for the young and the reasonably healthy elderly, the walk features views of the Gorge itself and the presence of koalas and wallabies in their wild state (at least some of the resident wallabies are relatively unafraid of tourists and will often study the passing parade of visitors as keenly as the visitors study them).  
On 16 January 2006, lightning sparked a bushfire in the Steiglitz historical area which soon spread throughout the Brisbane Ranges. Despite lengthy efforts to control the fire from DSE, Parks Victoria and CFA fire fighters, the blaze incinerated 6700 hectares of parkland but luckily destroyed only two houses and caused no human fatalities.

[[Churchill National Park]]

CATEGORIES: National parks of Victoria (Australia), Protected areas established in 1941, 1941 establishments in Australia

Churchill is a national park in Victoria, Australia, 31 km southeast of Melbourne. Churchill NP is in the suburb of Lysterfield South, which lies between Rowville and Endeavour Hills in the far north of the City Of Casey. It is also near the Monash Freeway and Stud Road. Churchill National Park has fantastic woodland and lots of fauna.
Churchill is joined onto Lysterfield Park, and joined, they cover around 16.68 km².
There are tracks throughout Churchill for walking, cycling and jogging. One recommended walking track for a very peaceful walk is Channel Track, surrounded by thick woodland and it runs beside the old aqueduct. The Eastern boundary track is particularly good for cycling and jogging. Bird watching is spectacular at Churchill NP, and one good spot for bird watching is by the dam along the northern boundary track.
The park that is now Churchill national park was once the police corps headquarters for blacktrackers and provided grazing land for the police horses. Many years later it was known as the Police Paddocks. In the 1920s, metropolitan development brought some change to Churchill, which was still known as Police Paddocks. Local stone was dug up for road metal and building material, a water supply channel was cut to Dandenong, and the State Electricity Commission obtained a power line easement. Fire and the clearing of the area took place. In 1941 the area was named Dandenong National Park, later renamed Churchill National Park (after Sir Winston Churchill) in 1944.
Churchill National Park is famous for its 173 different species of birds, such as the Australian Wood Duck and the Pacific Black Duck. Most mammals are only active at night, so if you arrive early or leave late, you might be lucky enough to see one, such as Echidnas, Wallabies and Kangaroos. Echidnas are also active during the day, searching for ants and grubs in the ground.
The picnic ground at Churchill NP has gas barbecues, a uni-sex toilet and shelter. Picnic grounds are provided on the end of the access road.

In his use of dynamic composition, illusionistic perspective and dramatic foreshortening, Correggio prefigured the Rococo art of the 18th century.

Dionysius Exiguus (Dennis the Small, Dennis the Dwarf, Dennis the Little or Dennis the Short, meaning humble) ([tpl]circa|470[/tpl] – [tpl]c.|544[/tpl]) was a 6th-century monk born in Scythia Minor (probably modern Dobruja, which is in Romania and Bulgaria). He was a member of the Scythian monks community concentrated in Tomis, the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the "inventor" of the Anno Domini (AD) era, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the (Christianized) Julian calendar.
From about 500 he lived in Rome, where, as a learned member of the Roman Curia, he translated from Greek into Latin 401 ecclesiastical canons, including the apostolical canons and the decrees of the councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon and Sardis, and also a collection of the decretals of the popes from Siricius to Anastasius II. These collections had great authority in the West and still guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.
The author of a continuation of Dionysius's Computus, writing in 616, described Dionysius as a "most learned abbot of the city of Rome", and the Venerable Bede accorded him the honorific abbas, which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend Cassiodorus stated in Institutiones that he was still a monk late in life.

[[Dominator culture]]

CATEGORIES: Cultural studies, Social ethics

Dominator culture  is a term coined by futurist and writer Riane Eisler. This term first appears in her book The Chalice and the Blade (Harper Collins San Francisco, 1987).  This book outlines in detail her theory of hierarchical dominator cultures vs. egalitarian "Partnership" cultures.  
Terence McKenna, a friend of Eisler, consciously borrowed and credited Eisler's ideas in his notes and the bibliographies of his books. He used the idea of dominator culture in part to illuminate what happened to cultures native to the Americas, and in part to describe the contrasting, antithetical character of what he sees as Western patriarchal culture—indicating, for example, his claims that it perennially lacks social conscience and lacks concern for the environment.  Furthermore he argues that, "The entire structure of the dominator culture ... is based upon 'our alienation from nature, from ourselves and from each other'". Terence McKenna & Gerry Mander As a result, McKenna claimed, "Our ideas are exhausted—the ideas that we inherit out of Christianity and its half-brother science, or its bastard child science."

Tarra-Bulga is a national park in eastern Victoria, Australia, 158 km from Melbourne in the Strzelecki Ranges. It is home to one of the last remnants of the indigenous eucalypt forests which once covered the region.
The area was first set aside as Bulga National Park in 1904. It comprised only 20 hectares. In 1909 Tarra Valley National Park was designated nearby. Over the years the two parks were gradually enlarged and then merged under the current name in 1986.
The deeply incised river valleys of the park are dominated by wet sclerophyll tall open forest of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans), with an understorey of blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), hazel pomaderris (Pomaderris aspera) and tree ferns (Dicksonia antarctica and Cyathea australis). Pockets of the park feature cool temperate rainforest, including Myrtle Beech Nothofagus cunninghamii.
The ridges are dominated by open forest and low open forest of stringybark eucalypts and gums. The park is also noted for its diversity of Fungi species, which are prominent in Autumn.
The tourist attractions include a large suspension bridge walk over the valley and many bushwalking tracks, and now provides visitors with an excellent example of the sort of forests which were once widespread in the area. The park has a visitors centre which is open on weekends and school and public holidays. It is staffed by members of the Friends of Tarra-Bulga National Park who also undertake restoration and monitoring activities.

[[Bondage (BDSM)]]

CATEGORIES: Bondage (BDSM)

Bondage or ligotage is consensually tying, binding, or restraining a partner for erotic, aesthetic, and/or somatosensory stimulation.  
Rope, cuffs, bondage tape, self-adhesive bandages, or other restraints may be used for this purpose.
Bondage itself does not imply sadomasochism. Bondage may be used as an end into itself, as in the case of rope bondage and breast bondage. It may also be used as a part of sex or in conjunction with other BDSM activities. The letter "B" in the acronym "BDSM" comes from the word "bondage". Sexuality and erotica are an important aspect in bondage, but are often not the end in itself. Aesthetics also plays an important role in bondage.
A common reason for the active partner to tie up their partner is so both may gain pleasure from the restrained partner's submission and the feeling of the temporary transfer of control and power. For sadomasochistic people, bondage is often used as a means to an end, where the restrained partner is more accessible to other sadomasochistic behaviour. However, bondage can also be used for its own sake. The active partner can derive visual pleasure from seeing their partner tied up, and the restrained partner can derive tactile pleasure from the feeling of helplessness and immobility.

Beedelup National Park is a national park in Western Australia (Australia), 277 km south of Perth. It is situated on the Vasse Highway some 10 km west of Pemberton. The park is especially lush and damp due to an abundance of water.[tpl]cite web|title=Beedelup National Park|publisher=Australia's South West|url=http://www.australiassouthwest.com/en/Natural+Wonders/Beedelup+National+Park.htm|accessdate=19 December 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061229084048/http://www.australiassouthwest.com/en/Natural+Wonders/Beedelup+National+Park.htm| archivedate= 29 December 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Gazetted in 1910, the park was declared an A Class Reserve in 1915. The Pemberton National Parks Board has been responsible for management of the park since 1957. Controlled burns occur within the park and some clear felling operations have been conducted in selected areas.
The park is mostly karri forest, with mixed areas of jarrah and marri. The loamy soil supports large colonies of moss and plants such as the swamp peppermint, hibbertia, karri hazel, waterbush, myrtle wattle and lemonscented Darwinia all of which thrive in the damp conditions. Some of the forest is an excellent example of uncut old growth forest. Some of the upland areas are sandy and support communities of heath vegetation. Other plants of interest in the area include Crowea dentata, Crowea augustifolia and Choretrum lateriflorum.[tpl]cite AHD|9561|Beedelup National Park|date=2010|accessdate=14 November 2010[/tpl]
Some rare fauna are thought to inhabit the area including the Woylie, Numbat and the Tammar.
Its major attraction is the Beedelup Falls, which are in full flow during winter and spring.[tpl]cite web|title=ParkFinder|publisher=NatureBase|url=http://www.naturebase.net/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,90/Itemid,755/|accessdate=19 December 2006[/tpl] A suspension bridge, built in 1995, offers passage across Beedelup Brook and good views of the falls.[tpl]cite web|title=Beedelup National Park|publisher=totaltravel.com|url=http://www.totaltravel.com.au/travel/wa/southwestwa/southernforest/guide/beedelup-national-park|accessdate=19 December 2006[/tpl] 
Another feature of the park is the walk through karri tree, a 400 year old tree with a large man-made hole cut through at the base large enough for a person to stand in.[tpl]cite web|title=About Australia - Beedelup National Park|publisher=totaltravel.com|url=http://www.about-australia.com/travel-guides/western-australia/australias-south-west/attractions/natural/beedelup-national-park/|accessdate=19 December 2006[/tpl] 
The park is named after Beedelup brook, named in 1875. It is thought the name Beedelup is derived from the Noongar word Beejalup meaning place of rest or place of sleep.

Despite this, the vegetation is diverse with countless species thriving in this environment. Vegetation ranges from the rich kwongan heaths, woodlands and mallee shrublands. The area is recognised for its unique variety of vegetation. With its own designated plateau vegetation system. Other attributes that the park is known for and the wildflowers, Samphire and Salt Lakes.

[[Geikie Gorge National Park]]

Geikie Gorge National Park is a national park in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, [tpl]convert|1837|km|mi|0[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Great Circle Distance between Geike Gorge National Park and Perth|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/distancedraw2?rec1=293571&placename=perth&placetype=0&state=WA+&place1=GEIKIE+GORGE+NATIONAL+PARK&place1long=125.755562&place1lat=-18.045000|publisher=Geoscience Australia|date=March 2004[/tpl] (great circle distance) northeast of Perth and approximately [tpl]convert|420|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Broome by road.
The gorge was named in honour of Sir Archibald Geikie, the Director General of Geological Survey for Great Britain and Ireland when it was given its European name in 1883. Sir Archibald never visited the gorge and in due course the traditional owners, the Bunuba people, hope that it will be more generally known by its Aboriginal name, Darngku.
The park is one of the most accessible in the Kimberley as it is only [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Fitzroy Crossing and is serviced by a bitumen road. No camping is allowed in the park and visitors can only enter during the day. The park has picnic shelters, barbecue areas, toilets and water available.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kimberleyaustralia.com/geikie-gorge-national-park.html|title=Kimberley Australia - Travel Guide|year=2009|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl]
A [tpl]convert|3|km|mi|0|adj=on[/tpl] walk trail exists along the eastern base of the gorge walls although the terrain is rough and uneven it does offer an excellent view.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpi.wa.gov.au/walking_wheretowalk.pdf|title=Where to Walk in WA|year=2006|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl] The western side of the gorge is closed to visitors as it is a nature preserve. Tour boats also operate in the gorge and a boat ramp is available for the public to use.
The gorge has been formed by the Fitzroy River and the level of the river in the wet season can rise by up to [tpl]convert|16.5|m|ft|sigfig=2[/tpl].  The flood level can be clearly seen on the walls where the abrasive action of the floodwaters on the limestone has scoured the surface white.
The limestone was originally a reef formed not by corals but by algae and lime secreting organisms that are now extinct. The reef was formed in the Devonian period when the reeding waters allowed the organisms to build a reef up to [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] thick. The remains of the reef now stand as the limestone range that wind across the countryside up to [tpl]convert|100|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on[/tpl] above the plains. Fossils from the devonian can be found within the limestone strata. 
The river water sustains an abundance of life including barramundi, sawfish and freshwater crocodiles all of which can be found in the gorge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelmate.com.au/Places/Places.asp?TownName=Fitzroy+Crossing_%5C_WA|title=Travelmate - Fitzroy Crossing WA|year=2009|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl]
The vegetation that fringes the river bank includes River Gums, freshwater mangroves, pandanus, cadjeput and native figs. Dense banks of reeds are also found along the banks. The flora provides a suitable habitat for a range of fauna including fruit bats, lilac-crowned wren, reed warbler and the great bowerbird.

The Range formed a natural border for two aboriginal peoples, the Maia and the Malgaru. Natural springs located on the edge of the ranges would have provided game to hunt and outcrops of chert would have provided stone for tools. Over 100 sites provide evidence that the traditional owners inhabited the area for over 20,000 years prior to European settlement.
The first European to explore the area was Francis Thomas Gregory whose expedition reached the range in 1858. Gregory named the range after the Governor of Western Australia at the time, Arthur Edward Kennedy.
He also named the nearby Lyons River in the same expedition before continuing to Mount Augustus. Pastoralists arrived in the area shortly afterward with Charles Brockman setting up Boolathana Station in 1877 and the region experienced success in wool production until the 1930s when the overgrazing, drought and the great depression caused most businesses to fail.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturebase.net/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,57/Itemid,755/|title=Department of the Environment - Park Finder - Kennedy Range National Park|year=2010|accessdate=14 June 2010[/tpl]
The valleys and plains of the range had been severely degraded but the range top was only slightly damaged as a result of pastoral activity. The area has been explored for minerals but has not been mined.
The park was officially gazetted in 1993 and contains some facilities for visitors. A bush toilet and camp-sites are located at Temple Gorge, but it is planned to re-locate this camp ground. There are a number of walk trails within the park but no water is available. Entry to the park is free but camp-site fees apply.

Porongurup National Park is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia (Australia), 360 km southeast of Perth and 40 km from Albany.
It protects the Porongurup Range, an extremely ancient and largely levelled mountain range formed in the Precambrian over 1200 million years ago. The present range is no more than fifteen km (10 miles) from east to west and consists of granite peaks levelled into domes. The highest point in the Porongurup Range is Devils Slide at 670 metres (2,200 ft) whilst there are several other peaks above 600 metres (1,970 ft), which is about 400 metres above the surrounding plain. Indeed, for much of the Cretaceous and Paleogene the Porongurup Range was an island surrounded by the sea, with the Stirling Range forming the southern coastline.
It is believed that the Porongurup Range is a remnant of the Precambrian collision that joined Australia and Antarctica until they separated in the Paleocene. There remain major granite intrusions in what is left of what must once have been a large mountain range.

[[Nonmetal]]
CATEGORIES: Nonmetals, Periodic table

In chemistry, a nonmetal or non-metal is a chemical element which mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals tend to be highly volatile (easily vaporised), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, they tend to have high ionisation energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine); and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulfur, selenium, and iodine).
Moving rightward across the standard form of periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours, as is the case (for example) with carbon (in its standard state[tpl]#tag:ref|The standard state of an element (with one exception) is the most thermodynamically stable form of the element at ambient conditions. The exception is phosphorus, the standard state of which is the white allotrope, the most thermodynamically unstable, as well as the most volatile and reactive form.Greenwood & Earnshaw 2002, pp. 479, 482 It is also the most common, industrially important,Eagleson 1994, p. 820 and easily reproducible allotrope. For those reasons white phosphorus (rather than the black allotrope, which is the most thermodynamically stable form) is the standard state of the element.Oxtoby, Gillis & Campion 2008, p. 508|group=n[/tpl] of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic metals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.
Although five times more elements are metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe,Sukys 1999, p. 60 and one—oxygen—makes up close to half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere.Bettelheim et al. 2010, p. 37 Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals,Schulze-Makuch & Irwin 2008, p. 89 and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.Steurer 2007, p. 7

Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, in the English county of Suffolk, is the site of two 6th- and early 7th-century cemeteries. One contained an undisturbed ship burial including a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts of outstanding art-historical and archaeological significance, now held in the British Museum in London.
Sutton Hoo is of a primary importance to early medieval historians because it sheds light on a period of English history that is on the margin between myth, legend, and historical documentation. Use of the site culminated at a time when Rædwald, the ruler of the East Angles, held senior power among the English people and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England; it is generally thought most likely that he is the person buried in the ship. The site has been vital in understanding the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia and the whole early Anglo-Saxon period.
The ship-burial, probably dating from the early 7th century and excavated in 1939, is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, far-reaching connections, the quality and beauty of its contents, and the profound interest of the burial ritual itself. The initial excavation was privately sponsored by the landowner, but when the significance of the find became apparent, national experts took over. Subsequent archaeological campaigns, particularly in the late 1960s and late 1980s, have explored the wider site and many other individual burials. The most significant artefacts from the ship-burial, displayed in the British Museum, are those found in the burial chamber, including a suite of metalwork dress fittings in gold and gems, a ceremonial helmet, shield and sword, a lyre, and many pieces of silver plate from Byzantium. The ship-burial has from the time of its discovery prompted comparisons with the world described in the heroic Old English poem Beowulf, which is set in southern Sweden. It is in that region, especially at Vendel, that close archaeological parallels to the ship-burial are found, both in its general form and in details of the military equipment that the burial contains.
Although it is the ship-burial that commands the greatest attention from tourists, there is also rich historical meaning in the two separate cemeteries, their position in relation to the Deben estuary and the North Sea, and their relation to other sites in the immediate neighborhood. Of the two grave fields found at Sutton Hoo, one (the "Sutton Hoo cemetery") had long been known to exist because it consists of a group of approximately 20 earthen burial mounds that rise slightly above the horizon of the hill-spur when viewed from the opposite bank. The other, called here the "new" burial ground, is situated on a second hill-spur close to the present Exhibition Hall, about 500 m upstream of the first, and was discovered and partially explored in 2000 during preparations for the construction of the hall. This also had burials under mounds, but was not known because they had long since been flattened by agricultural activity. The site has a visitor's centre, with many original and replica artefacts and a reconstruction of the ship burial chamber, and the burial field can be toured in the summer months.

St Paul's Cathedral, London, is a Church of England cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of London and mother church of the Diocese of London.  It sits at the top of Ludgate Hill, the highest point in the City of London.  Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604.B. Weinreb & C. Hibbert. "The London Encyclopaedia" p. 778.  The present church, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren.   Its construction, completed within Wren's lifetime,  was part of a major rebuilding programme which took place in the city after the Great Fire of London.Helen Gardner; Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya, Gardner's Art through the Ages. Thomson Wadsworth, (2004) ISBN 0-15-505090-7
The cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London, with its dome, framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, dominating the skyline for 300 years.Sir John Betjeman, A Pictorial History of English Architecture, John Murray, (1970), ISBN 0-7195-2640-X At [tpl]convert|365|ft[/tpl] high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1962, and its dome is also among the highest in the world. In terms of area, St Paul's is the second largest church building in the United Kingdom after Liverpool Cathedral.
St Paul's Cathedral occupies a significant place in the national identity of the English population.Rebecca Pierce, National Identity and the British Empire: the Image of Saint Paul’s Cathedral, Master's Thesis, Marshall University (2004) http://www.marshall.edu/etd/masters/pierce-rebecca-2004-ma.pdf It is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as postcard images of the dome standing tall, surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz. Important services held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Sir Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, the launch of the Festival of Britain and the thanksgiving services for the Golden Jubilee, the 80th Birthday and the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

[[Essential amino acid]]

CATEGORIES: Amino acids, Essential nutrients, Nitrogen metabolism, Nutrition

An essential amino acid or indispensable amino acid is an amino acid that cannot be synthesized de novo (from scratch) by the organism being considered, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. The amino acids regarded as essential for humans are phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, and histidine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Young VR |title=Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=124 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=1517S–1523S |year=1994 |pmid=8064412 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/124/8_Suppl/1517S.pdf[/tpl] Additionally, cysteine (or sulphur-containing amino acids), tyrosine (or aromatic amino acids), and arginine are always required by infants and growing children.[tpl]cite journal |author=Imura K, Okada A |title=Amino acid metabolism in pediatric patients |journal=Nutrition |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=143–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9437700 |url= |doi=10.1016/S0899-9007(97)00230-X[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf|title=PROTEIN AND AMINO ACID REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION|author=FAO/WHO/UNU|publisher=WHO Press|year=2007[/tpl], page 150 Essential amino acids are "essential" not because they are more important for protein synthesis or general homeostasis than the others, but because the body does not synthesize them. If they are not uptaken through diet, they will not be available for protein synthesis. 
In addition, the amino acids arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline, serine and tyrosine are considered conditionally essential, meaning they are not normally required in the diet, but must be supplied exogenously to specific populations that do not synthesize them in adequate amounts. An example would be with the disease phenylketonuria (PKU). Individuals living with PKU must keep their intake of phenylalanine extremely low to prevent mental retardation and other metabolic complications. However, they cannot synthesize tyrosine from phenylalanine, so tyrosine becomes essential in the diet of PKU patients.
The distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and homocysteine, can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized de novo in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Likewise arginine, ornithine, and citrulline, which are interconvertible by the urea cycle, are considered a single group.

[[Net protein utilization]]
CATEGORIES: Amino acids, Proteins

The net protein utilization, or NPU, is the ratio of amino acid converted to proteins to the ratio of amino acids supplied. This figure is somewhat affected by the salvage of essential amino acids within the body, but is profoundly affected by the level of limiting amino acids within a foodstuff.
Experimentally, this value can be determined by determining dietary protein intake and then measuring nitrogen excretion. One formula for NPU is:
As a value, NPU can range from 1 to 0, with a value of 1 indicating 100% utilization of dietary nitrogen as protein and a value of 0 an indication that none of the nitrogen supplied was converted to protein.
Certain foodstuffs, such as eggs or milk, rate as 1 on an NPU chart.
The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score is a more modern rating for determining protein quality.

[[Orthogonality]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra, Linear algebra, Factoring

In mathematics, orthogonality is the relation of two lines at right angles to one another (perpendicularity), and the generalization of this relation into n dimensions; and to a variety of mathematical relations thought of as describing non-overlapping, uncorrelated, or independent objects of some kind.  A widespread example is with vinyl records in the 1960s that were able to get left and right stereo signals from one single groove.  By making the groove a 90-degree cut into the vinyl, wave motion on one wall was independent from any motion (or non-motion) along the other wall.
The concept of orthogonality has been broadly generalized in mathematics, science, and engineering, especially since the beginning of the 16th century. Much of it has involved the concepts of mathematical functions, calculus, and linear algebra.

The Washington Naval Treaty, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, was a treaty among the major nations that had won World War I, which by the terms of the treaty agreed to prevent an arms race by limiting naval construction. It was negotiated at the Washington Naval Conference, which was held in Washington, D.C., from November 1921 to February 1922, and signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy. It limited the construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers by the signatories. The numbers of other categories of warships, including cruisers, destroyers and submarines, were not limited by the treaty but were limited to 10,000 tons displacement. 
Subsequent to the treaty were a number of other naval arms limitation conferences that sought to increase limitations of warship building. The terms of the Washington treaty were modified by the London Naval Treaty of 1930 and the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. By the mid-1930s, Japan and Italy renounced the treaties, making naval arms limitation an increasingly untenable position for the other signatories.
